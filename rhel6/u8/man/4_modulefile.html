<p>MODULEFILE(4) Modules configuration MODULEFILE(4)</p>

<p>NAME modulefile - files containing Tcl code for the
Modules package</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION modulefiles are written in the Tool Command
Language, Tcl(3) and are interpreted by the modulecmd
program via the module(1) user interface. modulefiles can be
loaded, unloaded, or switched on-the-fly while the user is
working; and can be used to implement site policies
regarding the access and use of applications.</p>

<p>A modulefile begins with the magic cookie, #%Module. A
version number may be placed after this string. The version
number is useful as the modulefile format may change. If a
version number doesnt exist, then modulecmd will assume the
modulefile is compatible with the latest version. The
current modulefile version is 1.0. Files without the magic
cookie will not be interpreted by modulecmd.</p>

<p>Each modulefile contains the changes to a user s
environment needed to access an application. Tcl is a simple
programming language which permits modulefiles to be
arbitrarily complex, depending upon the application s and
the modulefile writers needs. If support for extended tcl
(tclX) has been configured for your installation of the
Modules package, you may use all the extended commands
provided by tclX, too.</p>

<p>A typical modulefile is a simple bit of code that set or
add entries to the PATH, MANPATH, or other environment
variables. Tcl has conditional statements that are evaluated
when the modulefile is loaded. This is very effective for
managing path or environment changes due to different OS
releases or architectures. The user environment information
is encapsulated into a single modulefile kept in a central
location. The same modulefile is used by every user on any
machine. So, from the users perspective, starting an
application is exactly the same irrespective of the machine
or platform they are on.</p>

<p>modulefiles also hide the notion of different types of
shells. From the users perspective, changing the environment
for one shell looks exactly the same as changing the
environment for another shell. This is useful for new or
novice users and eliminates the need for statements such as
&quot;if youre using the C Shell do this ..., otherwise if
youre using the Bourne shell do this ...&quot; Announcing
and accessing new software is uniform and independent of the
users shell. From the modulefile writers perspective, this
means one set of information will take care of every type of
shell.</p>

<p>Modules Specific Tcl Commands The Modules Package uses
commands which are extensions to the &quot;standard&quot;
Tool Command Language Tcl(3) package. Unless otherwise
specified, the Module commands return the empty string. Some
commands behave differently when a modulefile is loaded or
unloaded. The command descriptions assume the modulefile is
being loaded.</p>

<p>break This is not a Modules-specific command, it s
actually part of Tcl, which has been overloaded similar to
the continue and exit commands to have the effect of causing
the module not to be listed as loaded and not affect other
modules being loaded concurrently. All non-environment
commands within the module will be performed up to this
point and processing will continue on to the next module on
the command line. The break command will only have this
effect if not used within a Tcl loop though.</p>

<p>An example: Suppose that a full selection of modulefiles
are needed for various different architectures, but some of
the modulefiles are not needed and the user should be
alerted. Having the unnecessary modulefile be a link to the
following notavail modulefile will perform the task as
required.</p>

<p>#%Module1.0 ## notavail modulefile ## proc ModulesHelp {
} { puts stderr &quot;This module does nothing but alert the
user&quot; puts stderr &quot;that the [module-info name]
module is not available&quot; }</p>

<p>module-whatis &quot;Notifies user that module is not
available.&quot; set curMod [module-info name] if { [
module-info mode load ] } { puts stderr &quot;Note: $curMod
is not available for [uname sysname].&quot; }</p>

<p>break</p>

<p>chdir directory Set the current working directory to
directory.</p>

<p>continue This is not a modules specific command but
another overloaded Tcl command and is similar to the break
or exit commands except the module will be listed as loaded
as well as performing any environment or Tcl commands up to
this point and then continuing on to the next module on the
command line. The continue command will only have this
effect if not used within a Tcl loop though.</p>

<p>exit [N] This is not a modules specific command but
another overloaded Tcl command and is similar to the break
or continue commands. However, this command will cause the
immediate cessation of this module and any additional ones
on the command line. This module and the subsequent modules
will not be listed as loaded. No environment commands will
be performed in the current module.</p>

<p>The integer value N after the exit command will be used
as an command exit value; however, some shells (bash being
one of them) do not carry this value through an eval though.
For bash and those Bourne shells (/bin/sh) being emulated by
the bash will have return a non-zero value as a result of
test 0 = 1 being appended to the evaluate string.</p>

<p>setenv variable value Set environment variable to value.
The setenv command will also change the process environment.
A reference using Tcls env associative array will reference
changes made with the setenv command. Changes made using Tcl
s env associative array will NOT change the users
environment variable like the setenv command. An environment
change made this way will only affect the module parsing
process. The setenv command is also useful for changing the
environment prior to the exec or system command. When a
modulefile is unloaded, setenv becomes unsetenv. If the
environment variable had been defined it will be overwritten
while loading the modulefile. A subsequent unload will unset
the environment variable - the previous value cannot be
restored! (Unless you handle it explicitly ... see
below.)</p>

<p>unsetenv variable [value] Unsets environment variable.
However, if there is an optional value, then when unloading
a module, it will set variable to value. The unsetenv
command changes the process environment like setenv.</p>

<p>append-path [ -d C | --delim C | --delim=C ] variable
value prepend-path [ -d C | --delim C | --delim=C ] variable
value Append or prepend value to environment variable. The
variable is a colon, or delimiter, separated list such as
&quot;PATH=directory:directory:directory&quot;. The default
delimiter is a colon :, but an arbitrary one can be given by
the --delim option. For example a space can be used instead
(which will need to be handled in the Tcl specially by
enclosing it in &quot; &quot; or { }). A space, however, can
not be specified by the --delim=C form.</p>

<p>If the variable is not set, it is created. When a
modulefile is unloaded, append-path and prepend-path become
remove-path.</p>

<p>remove-path [ -d C | --delim C | --delim=C ] variable
value Remove value from the colon, or delimiter, separated
list in variable. See prepend-path or append-path for
further explanation of using an arbitrary delimiter. Every
string between colons, or delimiters, in variable is
compared to value. If the two match, value is removed from
variable.</p>

<p>prereq modulefile [ modulefile ... ] conflict modulefile
[ modulefile ... ] prereq and conflict control whether or
not the modulefile will be loaded. The prereq command lists
modulefiles which must have been previously loaded before
the current modulefile will be loaded. Similarly, the
conflict command lists modulefiles which conflict with the
current modulefile. If a list contains more than one
modulefile, then each member of the list acts as a Boolean
OR operation. Multiple prereq and conflict commands may be
used to create a Boolean AND operation. If one of the
requirements have not been satisfied, an error is reported
and the current modulefile makes no changes to the users
environment.</p>

<p>If an argument for prereq is a directory and any
modulefile from the directory has been loaded, then the
prerequisite is met. For example, specifying X11 as a prereq
means that any version of X11, X11/R4 or X11/R5, must be
loaded before proceeding.</p>

<p>If an argument for conflict is a directory and any other
modulefile from that directory has been loaded, then a
conflict will occur. For example, specifying X11 as a
conflict will stop X11/R4 and X11/R5 from being loaded at
the same time.</p>

<p>is-loaded modulefile [ modulefile ... ] The is-loaded
command returns a true value if any of the listed
modulefiles has been loaded. If a list contains more than
one modulefile, then each member acts as a boolean OR
operation. If an argument for is-loaded is a directory and
any modulefile from the directory has been loaded is-loaded
would return a true value.</p>

<p>module [ sub-command ] [ sub-command-args ] Contains the
same sub-commands as described in the module(1) man page in
the Module Sub-Commands section. This command permits a
modulefile to load or remove other modulefiles. No checks
are made to ensure that the modulefile does not try to load
itself. Often it is useful to have a single modulefile that
performs a number of module load commands. For example, if
every user on the system requires a basic set of
applications loaded, then a core modulefile would contain
the necessary module load commands.</p>

<p>module-info option [ info-args ] Provide information
about the modulecmd program s state. Some of the information
is specific to the internals of modulecmd. option is the
type of information to be provided, and info-args are any
arguments needed.</p>

<p>module-info type Returns either &quot;C&quot; or
&quot;Tcl&quot; to indicate which module command is being
executed, either the &quot;C&quot; version or the Tcl-only
version, to allow the modulefile writer to handle any
differences between the two. module-info flags Returns the
integer value of modulecms flags state. module-info mode
[modetype] Returns the current modulecmd s mode as a string
if no modetype is given.</p>

<p>Returns 1 if modulecms mode is modetype. modetype can
be: load, remove, display, help, whatis, switch, switch1,
switch2, or switch3.</p>

<p>module-info name Return the name of the modulefile. This
is not the full pathname for modulefile. See the Modules
Variables section for information on the full pathname.</p>

<p>module-info specified Return the name of the modulefile
specified on the command line.</p>

<p>module-info shell Return the current shell under which
modulecmd was invoked. This is the first parameter of
modulecmd, which is normally hidden by the module alias.</p>

<p>module-info shelltype Return the family of the shell
under which modulefile was invoked. As of module-info shell
this depends on the first parameter of modulecmd. The output
reflects a shell type determining the shell syntax of the
commands produced by modulecmd.</p>

<p>module-info alias name Returns the full module file name
to which the module file alias name is assigned</p>

<p>module-info version module-file Returns a list of all
symbolic versions assigned to the passed module-file. The
paremeter module-file might either be a full qualified
module file with name and version, another symbolic module
file name or a module file alias.</p>

<p>module-version module-file version-name [version-name
...] Assigns the symbolic version-name to the module file
module-file This command should be placed in one of the
modulecmd rc files in order to provide shorthand invocations
of frequently used module file names.</p>

<p>The special version-name default specifies the default
version to be used for module commands, if no specific
version is given. This replaces the definitions made in the
.version file in former modulecmd releases.</p>

<p>The parameter module-file may be either</p>

<p>a fully qualified modulefile with name and version a
symbolic module file name another module file alias</p>

<p>module-alias name module-file Assignes the module file
module-file to the alias name. This command should be placed
in one of the modulecmd rc files in order to provide
shorthand invocations of frequently used module file
names.</p>

<p>The parameter module-file may be either</p>

<p>a fully qualified modulefile with name and version a
symbolic module file name another module file alias</p>

<p>module-trace {on|off} [command [command ...]] [-module
modulefile [modulefile ...]] Switches tracing on or off.
Without parameters this command will affect globally all
tracing setups for all commands and modulefiles. The command
parameter may be used to affect tracing of specified module
commands only and the switch -module finally limits the
affect of the module-trace command to a well defined set of
module files.</p>

<p>The command may be one of the following</p>

<p>avail - module avail command clear - module clear
command display - module display command init - module init
command help - module help command list - module list
command load - module load command purge - module purge
command switch - module switch command unuse - module unuse
command unload - module unload command update - module
update command use - module use command</p>

<p>The module parameter specifies a set of module files
using TCL regular expressions. For example</p>

<p>.* will affect all module files */2.0 affects all module
files at version 2.0 gnu/.* affects all versions of the gnu
modulefile gnu/2.0 affects only version 2.0 of the gnu
modulefile</p>

<p>The module parameter is prepended to the current tracing
pattern list for the specified module command. It is
evaluated from the left to the right. The first matching
pattern defines the tracing parameter.</p>

<p>The internal trace pattern list is stored as a colon
separated list. In advanced user level only, colons may be
specified on the module parameter of the module-trace
command. This will directly take effect in the internal
trace pattern list. In novice or expert user level a warning
messge will be generated.</p>

<p>module-user level Defines the user level under wich
module-cmd runs. This takes effect on the error messages
being produced and on the behavior of modulecmd in case of
detecting an outage.</p>

<p>The level parameter specifies the user level and may be
one of the following values:</p>

<p>advanced, adv - advanced user level expert, exp - expert
user level novice, nov - novice user level</p>

<p>module-verbosity {on|off} Switches verbose modulecmd
message display on or off.</p>

<p>module-log error-weight log-facility Defines whether
error messages of the specified weight should be logged and
conditionally assignes a log-facility.</p>

<p>The error-weight parameter specifies the error level to
be logged. It may be one of the following values:</p>

<p>verb - verbose messages info - informal messages debug -
debugging messages trace - tracing output warn - warnings
prob - problems (normally the modulecmd may be completed)
error - errors (which normally leads to unsuccessful end of
the modulecmd) fatal - fatal system errors panic - very
fatal system errors, e.g. internal program
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>The log-facility parameter specifies the log
destination. This may either switch off logging for the
specified error-weight, direct log messages to a special
stream or a file or specify a syslog facility for logging.
The following values are allowed:</p>

<p>stderr, stdout - predefined output streams for normal
and error outputs. Note, that stdout is normally used for
passing parameters to the invoking shell. Directing error
output to this stream might screw up the modulecmd
integration to your shell. a syslog facility - directs
logging to the syslog. See syslog.conf(4) for detailed
description of the valid syslog facilities. null, none -
will suppress logging of the specified error-weight. a
filename - is recognized by the first character being either
a . or a / . You must have write permission to the file you
specify.</p>

<p>module-whatis string Defines a string which is displayed
in case of the invocation of the module whatis command.
There may be more than one module- whatis line in a
modulefile. This command takes no actions in case of load,
display, etc. invocations of modulecmd.</p>

<p>The string parameter has to be enclosed in double-quotes
if theres more than one word specified. Words are defined to
be separated by whitespace characters (space, tab, cr).</p>

<p>set-alias alias-name alias-string Sets an alias or
function with the name alias-name in the users environment
to the string alias-string. Arguments can be specified using
the Bourne Shell style of function arguments. If the string
contains &quot;$1&quot;, then this will become the first
argument when the alias is interpreted by the shell. The
string &quot;$*&quot; corresponds to all of the arguments
given to the alias. The character $ may be escaped using the
character.</p>

<p>For some shells, aliases are not possible and the
command has no effect. For Bourne shell derivatives, a shell
function will be written (if supported) to give the
impression of an alias. When a modulefile is unloaded,
set-alias becomes unset-alias.</p>

<p>unset-alias alias-name Unsets an alias with the name
alias-name in the users environment. If the shell supports
functions then the shell is instructed to unset function
alias-name.</p>

<p>system string Pass string to the C library routine
system(3). For the system(3) call modulecmd redirects stdout
to stderr since stdout would be parsed by the evaluating
shell. The exit status of the executed command is
returned.</p>

<p>uname field Provide fast lookup of system information on
systems that support uname(3). uname is significantly faster
than using system to execute a program to return host
information. If uname(3) is not available, gethostname(3) or
some program will make the nodename available. uname will
return the string &quot;unknown&quot; if information is
unavailable for the field.</p>

<p>uname will invoke getdomainname in order to figure out
the name of the domain.</p>

<p>field values are:</p>

<p>sysname - the operating system name nodename - the
hostname domain - the name of the domain release - the
operating system release version - the operating system
version machine - a standard name that identifies the
systems hardware</p>

<p>x-resource resource-string x-resource filename Merge
resources into the X11 resource database. The resources are
used to control look and behavior of X11 applications. The
command will attempt to read resources from filename. If the
argument isnt a valid file name, then string will be
interpreted as a resource. If a file is found, it will be
filtered through the cpp(1) preprocessor, just as xrdb(1)
would do.</p>

<p>modulefiles that use this command, should in most cases
contain one or more x-resource lines, each defining one X11
resource. Reading resources from filename is much slower,
due to the preprocessing. The DISPLAY environment variable
should be properly set and the X11 server should be
accessible. If x- resource can t manipulate the X11 resource
database, the modulefile will exit with an error
message.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>x-resource /u2/staff/leif/.xres/Ileaf The file Ileaf is
preprocessed by cpp(1) and the result is merged into the X11
resource database.</p>

<p>x-resource [glob ~/.xres/ileaf] The Tcl glob function is
used to have the modulefile read different resource files
for different users.</p>

<p>x-resource {Ileaf.popup.saveUnder: True} Merge the Ileaf
resource into the X11 resource database.</p>

<p>Modules Variables The ModulesCurrentModulefile variable
contains the full pathname of the modulefile being
interpreted.</p>

<p>Locating Modulefiles Every directory in MODULEPATH is
searched to find the modulefile. A directory in MODULEPATH
can have an arbitrary number of sub- directories. If the
user names a modulefile to be loaded which is actually a
directory, the directory is opened and a search begins for
an actual modulefile. First, modulecmd looks for a file with
the name .modulerc in the directory. If this file exists,
its contents will be evaluated as if it was a module file to
be loaded. You may place module-version and module-alias
commands inside this file. Additionally, before seeking for
.modulerc files in the module directory, the global
.modulerc file is sourced, too. If a named version default
now exists for the module file to be loaded, the assigned
modulefile now will be sourced. Otherwise the file .version
is looked up in the directory. If the .version file exists,
it is opened and interpreted as Tcl code and takes
precedence over a .modulerc file in the same directory. If
the Tcl variable ModulesVersion is set by the .version file,
modulecmd will use the name as if it specifies a modulefile
in the directory. This will become the default module file
in this case. If ModulesVersion is a directory, the search
begins anew down that directory. If the name does not match
any files located in the current directory, the search
continues through the remaining directories in
MODULEPATH.</p>

<p>Every .version and .modulerc file found is Tcl
interpreted. So, changes made in these file will affect the
subsequently interpreted modulefile.</p>

<p>If no default version may be figured out, then the
highest lexicographically sorted modulefile under the
directory using the C locale will be used.</p>

<p>For example, it is possible for a user to have a
directory named X11 which simply contains a .version file
specifying which version of X11 is to be loaded. Such a file
would look like:</p>

<p>#%Module1.0 ## ## The desired version of X11 ## set
ModulesVersion &quot;R4&quot;</p>

<p>Modulefile Specific Help Users can request help about a
specific modulefile through the module(1) command. The
modulefile can print helpful information or start help
oriented programs by defining a ModulesHelp subroutine. The
subroutine will be called when the module help modulefile
command is used.</p>

<p>Modulefile Display The module display modulefile command
will detail all changes that will be made to the
environment. After displaying all of the environment changes
modulecmd will call the ModulesDisplay subroutine. The
ModulesDisplay subroutine is a good place to put additional
descriptive information about the modulefile.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT ${MODULEPATH} Path of directories containing
modulefiles.</p>
