<p>NAME ibod.cf - configuration file for ibod (ISDN
Bandwidth On Demand)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file contains the initial configuration
values for the ibod dae- mon. Each line contains a keyword
and a value.</p>

<p>Boolean attributes are set with 0 or 1 which corresponds
to false and true respectively. A boolean attribute not
specified at all is always false.</p>

<p>Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and will
be ignored.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT RULES! 1. Keywords are case sensitive. 2.
Kewords must begin at the first column. 3. Keywords and
values must be separated by exactly one (1) space or tab
character.</p>

<p>This file is re-read every time ibod receives SIGHUP (1)
signal.</p>

<p>OPTIONS DEVICE &lt;name&gt; Name of ISDN PPP device.
Default is ippp0.</p>

<p>ENABLE 1|0 Enable/disable bandwidth-on-demand. Default
is enable (1).</p>

<p>INTERVAL &lt;n&gt; Specify the sample time interval in
ms. Default is 500 ms.</p>

<p>FILTER &lt;n&gt; Defines &quot;filtering factor&quot;. A
value of 10 means that the average bytes/sec value measured
over 10 intervals must pass the limit defined by LIMIT to
bring up or down the slave link. Default is 5.</p>

<p>LIMIT &lt;n&gt; Transfer rate limit in bytes/sec for
bringing up or down ISDN slave channel. Default is 7000.</p>

<p>STAYUP 0|1 Enable/disable slave channel stay up
function. If enabled, the 2:nd cannel (slave link) will stay
up even if the average bytes/sec decrease the value defined
by LIMIT. In this case the slave link will stay up until
hangup time is reached. (Example: isdnctrl huptimeout ippp1
60) If disabled the slave link will be brought down in the
same way it was brought up. Default is 0.</p>

<p>STAYUP_TIME &lt;n&gt; Defines the minimum time in
seconds the 2:nd channel will uncon- ditionally stay up
after it has been brought up. Default value is 30.</p>
