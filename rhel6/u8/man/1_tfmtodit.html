<p>NAME tfmtodit - create font files for use with groff
-Tdvi</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tfmtodit [ -sv ] [ -ggf_file ] [ -kskewchar ]
tfm_file map_file font</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tfmtodit creates a font file for use with
groff -Tdvi. tfm_file is the name of the TeX font metric
file for the font. map_file is a file giv- ing the groff
names for characters in the font; this file should con- sist
of a sequence of lines of the form:</p>

<p>n c1 c2 ...</p>

<p>where n is a decimal integer giving the position of the
character in the font, and c1, c2,... are the groff names of
the character. If a character has no groff names but exists
in the tfm file, then it will be put in the groff font file
as an unnamed character. font is the name of the groff font
file. The groff font file is written to font.</p>

<p>The -s option should be given if the font is special (a
font is special if troff should search it whenever a
character is not found in the cur- rent font.) If the font
is special, it should be listed in the fonts command in the
DESC file; if it is not special, there is no need to list
it, since troff can automatically mount it when it s first
used.</p>

<p>To do a good job of math typesetting, groff requires
font metric infor- mation not present in the tfm file. The
reason for this is that TeX has separate math italic fonts
whereas groff uses normal italic fonts for math. The
additional information required by groff is given by the two
arguments to the math_fit macro in the Metafont programs for
the Computer Modern fonts. In a text font (a font for which
math_fitting is false), Metafont normally ignores these two
arguments. Metafont can be made to put this information in
the gf file by loading the following definition after cmbase
when creating cm.base:</p>

<p>def ignore_math_fit(expr
left_adjustment,right_adjustment) = special
&quot;adjustment&quot;; numspecial
left_adjustment*16/designsize; numspecial
right_adjustment*16/designsize; enddef;</p>

<p>For the EC font family, load the following definition
after exbase (it is probably easiest to patch exbase.mf
locally):</p>

<p>def ignore_math_fit(expr
left_adjustment,right_adjustment) = ori_special
&quot;adjustment&quot;; ori_numspecial
left_adjustment*16/designsize; ori_numspecial
right_adjustment*16/designsize; enddef;</p>

<p>The gf file created using this modified cm.base or
exbase should be specified with the -g option. The -g option
should not be given for a font for which math_fitting is
true.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Print the version number.</p>

<p>-s The font is special. The effect of this option is to
add the special command to the font file.</p>

<p>-kn The skewchar of this font is at position n. n should
be an integer; it may be given in decimal, or with a leading
0 in octal, or with a leading 0x in hexadecimal. The effect
of this option is to ignore any kerns whose second component
is the specified character.</p>

<p>-ggf_file gf_file is a gf file produced by Metafont
containing special and numspecial commands giving additional
font metric information.</p>
