<p>NAME ca-legacy - Manage the system configuration for
legacy CA certificates</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ca-legacy [COMMAND]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ca-legacy(8) is used to include or exclude a
set of legacy Certificate Authority (CA) certificates in the
systems list of trusted CA certificates.</p>

<p>The list of CA certificates and trust flags included in
the ca-certificates package are based on the decisions made
by Mozilla.org according to the Mozilla CA policy.</p>

<p>Occasionally, removal or distrust decisions made by
Mozilla.org might be incompatible with the requirements or
limitations of some applications that also use the CA
certificates list in the Linux environment.</p>

<p>The ca-certificates package might keep some CA
certificates included and trusted by default, as long as it
is seen necessary by the maintainers, despite the fact that
they have been removed by Mozilla. These certificates are
called legacy CA certificates.</p>

<p>The general requirements to keep legacy CA certificates
included and trusted might change over time, for example if
functional limitations of software packages have been
resolved. Future versions of the ca-certificates package
might reduce the set of legacy CA certificates that are
included and trusted by default.</p>

<p>The ca-legacy(8) command can be used to override the
default behaviour.</p>

<p>The mechanisms to individually trust or distrust CA
certificates as described in update-ca-trust(8) still
apply.</p>

<p>COMMANDS check The current configuration will be
shown.</p>

<p>default Configure the system to use the default
configuration, as recommended by the package
maintainers.</p>

<p>disable Configure the system to explicitly disable
legacy CA certificates. Using this configuration, the system
will use the set of included and trusted CA certificates as
released by Mozilla.</p>

<p>install The configuration file will be read and the
system configuration will be set accordingly. This command
is executed automatically during upgrades of the
ca-certificates package.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/pki/ca-trust/ca-legacy.conf A configuration
file that will be used and modified by the ca-legacy
command. The contents of the configuration file will be read
on package upgrades.</p>
