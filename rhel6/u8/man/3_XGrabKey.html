<p>XGrabKey(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XGrabKey(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGrabKey, XUngrabKey - grab keyboard keys</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XGrabKey(Display *display, int keycode,
unsigned int modifiers, Window grab_window, Bool
owner_events, int pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode);</p>

<p>int XUngrabKey(Display *display, int keycode, unsigned
int modifiers, Window grab_window);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the grab window.</p>

<p>keyboard_mode Specifies further processing of keyboard
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>keycode Specifies the KeyCode or AnyKey.</p>

<p>modifiers Specifies the set of keymasks or AnyModifier.
The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid keymask
bits.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether the keyboard events are to be reported as usual.</p>

<p>pointer_mode Specifies further processing of pointer
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGrabKey function establishes a passive
grab on the keyboard. In the future, the keyboard is
actively grabbed (as for XGrabKeyboard), the
last-keyboard-grab time is set to the time at which the key
was pressed (as transmitted in the KeyPress event), and the
KeyPress event is reported if all of the following
conditions are true:</p>

<p>&middot; The keyboard is not grabbed and the specified
key (which can itself be a modifier key) is logically
pressed when the specified modifier keys are logically down,
and no other modifier keys are logically down.</p>

<p>&middot; Either the grab_window is an ancestor of (or
is) the focus window, or the grab_window is a descendant of
the focus window and con- tains the pointer.</p>

<p>&middot; A passive grab on the same key combination does
not exist on any ancestor of grab_window.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
XGrabKeyboard. The active grab is terminated automatically
when the logical state of the keyboard has the specified key
released (independent of the logical state of the modifier
keys), at which point a KeyRelease event is reported to the
grabbing window.</p>

<p>Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by
client applica- tions) may lag the physical state if device
event processing is frozen.</p>

<p>A modifiers argument of AnyModifier is equivalent to
issuing the request for all possible modifier combinations
(including the combina- tion of no modifiers). It is not
required that all modifiers specified have currently
assigned KeyCodes. A keycode argument of AnyKey is
equivalent to issuing the request for all possible KeyCodes.
Other- wise, the specified keycode must be in the range
specified by min_key- code and max_keycode in the connection
setup, or a BadValue error results.</p>

<p>If some other client has issued a XGrabKey with the same
key combina- tion on the same window, a BadAccess error
results. When using AnyMod- ifier or AnyKey, the request
fails completely, and a BadAccess error results (no grabs
are established) if there is a conflicting grab for any
combination.</p>

<p>XGrabKey can generate BadAccess, BadValue, and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XUngrabKey function releases the key combination on
the specified window if it was grabbed by this client. It
has no effect on an active grab. A modifiers of AnyModifier
is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible
modifier combinations (including the combination of no
modifiers). A keycode argument of AnyKey is equivalent to
issuing the request for all possible key codes.</p>

<p>XUngrabKey can generate BadValue and BadWindow
error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess A client attempted to grab a
key/button combination already grabbed by another
client.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
