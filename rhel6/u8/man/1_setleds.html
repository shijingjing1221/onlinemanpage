<p>NAME setleds - set the keyboard leds</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setleds [-v] [-L] [-D] [-F] [{+|-}num]
[{+|-}caps] [{+|-}scroll]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Setleds reports and changes the led flag
settings of a VT (namely Num- Lock, CapsLock and
ScrollLock). Without arguments, setleds prints the current
settings. With arguments, it sets or clears the indicated
flags (and leaves the others unchanged). The settings before
and after the change are reported if the -v flag is
given.</p>

<p>The led flag settings are specific for each VT (and the
VT correspond- ing to stdin is used).</p>

<p>By default (or with option -F), setleds will only change
the VT flags (and their setting may be reflected by the
keyboard leds).</p>

<p>With option -D, setleds will change both the VT flags
and their default settings (so that a subsequent reset will
not undo the change). This might be useful for people who
always want to have numlock set.</p>

<p>With option -L, setleds will not touch the VT flags, but
only change the leds. From this moment on, the leds will no
longer reflect the VT flags (but display whatever is put
into them). The command setleds -L (without further
arguments) will restore the situation in which the leds
reflect the VT flags.</p>

<p>One might use setleds in /etc/rc to define the initial
and default state of NumLock, e.g. by INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
for tty in $INITTY; do setleds -D +num &lt; $tty done</p>

<p>OPTIONS -num +num Clear or set NumLock. (At present, the
NumLock setting influ- ences the interpretation of keypad
keys. Pressing the NumLock key complements the NumLock
setting.)</p>

<p>-caps +caps Clear or set CapsLock. (At present, the
CapsLock setting com- plements the Shift key when applied to
letters. Pressing the CapsLock key complements the CapsLock
setting.)</p>

<p>-scroll +scroll Clear or set ScrollLock. (At present,
pressing the ScrollLock key (or ^S/^Q) stops/starts console
output.)</p>

<p>BUGS In keyboard application mode the NumLock key does
not influence the NumLock flag setting.</p>
