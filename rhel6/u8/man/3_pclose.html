<p>NAME popen, pclose - pipe stream to or from a
process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>FILE *popen(const char *command, const char *type);</p>

<p>int pclose(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>popen(), pclose(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 2 ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE _BSD_SOURCE ||
_SVID_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The popen() function opens a process by
creating a pipe, forking, and invoking the shell. Since a
pipe is by definition unidirectional, the type argument may
specify only reading or writing, not both; the resulting
stream is correspondingly read-only or write-only.</p>

<p>The command argument is a pointer to a null-terminated
string contain- ing a shell command line. This command is
passed to /bin/sh using the -c flag; interpretation, if any,
is performed by the shell. The type argument is a pointer to
a null-terminated string which must contain either the
letter &rsquo;r&rsquo; for reading or the letter
&rsquo;w&rsquo; for writing. Since glibc 2.9, this argument
can additionally include the letter &rsquo;e&rsquo;, which
causes the close-on-exec flag (FD_CLOEXEC) to be set on the
underlying file descriptor; see the description of the
O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be
useful.</p>

<p>The return value from popen() is a normal standard I/O
stream in all respects save that it must be closed with
pclose() rather than fclose(3). Writing to such a stream
writes to the standard input of the command; the commands
standard output is the same as that of the process that
called popen(), unless this is altered by the command
itself. Conversely, reading from a &quot;popened&quot;
stream reads the com- mands standard output, and the
commands standard input is the same as that of the process
that called popen().</p>

<p>Note that output popen() streams are fully buffered by
default.</p>

<p>The pclose() function waits for the associated process
to terminate and returns the exit status of the command as
returned by wait4(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The popen() function returns NULL if the
fork(2) or pipe(2) calls fail, or if it cannot allocate
memory.</p>

<p>The pclose() function returns -1 if wait4(2) returns an
error, or some other error is detected.</p>

<p>ERRORS The popen() function does not set errno if memory
allocation fails. If the underlying fork(2) or pipe(2)
fails, errno is set appropriately. If the type argument is
invalid, and this condition is detected, errno is set to
EINVAL.</p>

<p>If pclose() cannot obtain the child status, errno is set
to ECHILD.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>The &rsquo;e&rsquo; value for type is a Linux
extension.</p>

<p>BUGS Since the standard input of a command opened for
reading shares its seek offset with the process that called
popen(), if the original pro- cess has done a buffered read,
the commands input position may not be as expected.
Similarly, the output from a command opened for writing may
become intermingled with that of the original process. The
latter can be avoided by calling fflush(3) before
popen().</p>

<p>Failure to execute the shell is indistinguishable from
the shells failure to execute command, or an immediate exit
of the command. The only hint is an exit status of 127.</p>
