<p>RESIZECONS(8) Console Support RESIZECONS(8)</p>

<p>NAME resizecons - change kernel idea of the console
size</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS resizecons COLSxROWS resizecons -lines ROWS</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The resizecons command tries to change the
videomode of the console. There are several aspects to this:
(a) the kernel must know about it, (b) the hardware must
know about it, (c) user programs must know about it, (d) the
console font may have to be adapted.</p>

<p>(a) The kernel is told about the change using the ioctl
VT_RESIZE. This causes the kernel to reallocate console
screen memory for all vir- tual consoles, and might fail if
there is not enough memory. (In that case, try to
disallocate some virtual consoles first.) If this ioctl
succeeds, but a later step fails (e.g., because you do not
have root permissions), you may be left with a very messy
screen.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of this is (b), since it
requires detailed knowledge of the video card hardware, and
the setting of numerous reg- isters. Only changing the
number of rows is slightly easier, and resizecons will try
to do that itself, when given the -lines option. (Probably,
root permission will be required.) The command resizecons
COLSxROWS will execute restoretextmode -r COLSxROWS (and
hence requires that you have svgalib installed). Here
COLSxROWS is a file that was created earlier by
restoretextmode -w COLSxROWS. Again, either root permissions
are required, or restoretextmode has to be suid root.</p>

<p>In order to deal with (c), resizecons does a stty rows
ROWS cols COLS for each active console (in the range
tty0..tty15), and sends a SIG- WINCH signal to selection if
it finds the file /tmp/selection.pid.</p>

<p>Finally, (d) is dealt with by executing a setfont
command. Most likely, the wrong font is loaded, and you may
want to do another setfont your- self afterwards.</p>

<p>BUGS resizecons does not work on all hardware. This
command used to be called resize, but was renamed to avoid
conflict with another command with the same name.</p>
