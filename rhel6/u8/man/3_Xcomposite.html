<p>DESCRIPTION The composite extension provides several
related mechanisms:</p>

<p>Per-hierarchy storage The rendering of an entire
hierarchy of windows is redirected to off-screen storage.
The pixels of that hierarchy are available whenever it is
viewable. Storage is automatically reallocated when the top
level window changes size. Contents beyond the geometry of
the top window are not preserved.</p>

<p>Automatic shadow update When a hierarchy is rendered
off-screen, the X server provides an automatic mechanism for
presenting those contents within the parent window. The
implementation is free to make this update lag behind actual
rendering operations by an unspecified amount of time. This
automatic update mechanism may be disabled so that the
parent window contents can be completely determined by an
external application.</p>

<p>Composite Overlay Window Version 0.3 of the protocol
adds the Composite Overlay Window, which provides
compositing managers with a surface on which to draw without
interference. This window is always above normal windows and
is always below the screen saver window. It is an
InputOutput window whose width and height are the screen
dimensions. Its visual is the root visual and its border
width is zero. Attempts to redirect it using the composite
extension are ignored. This window does not appear in the
reply of the QueryTree request. It is also an override
redirect window. These last two features make it invisible
to window managers and other X11 clients. The only way to
access the XID of this window is via the
CompositeGetOverlayWindow request. Initially, the Composite
Overlay Window is unmapped.</p>

<p>Parent window clipping Version 0.4 of the protocol
modifies the semantics of parent window clipping in the
presence of manual redirected children. With this version,
the area in the parent covered by manual redirected children
is left in the parent clip list instead of being removed as
in older versions.</p>

<p>Per-hierarchy storage may be created for individual
windows or for all children of a window. Manual shadow
update may be selected by only a single application for each
window; manual update may also be selected on a per-window
basis or for each child of a window. Detecting when to
update may be done with the Damage extension.</p>

<p>The off-screen storage includes the window contents, its
borders and the contents of all descendants.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Pointer to the Display structure
returned from XOpenDisplay for the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>event_base_return Pointer to integer where the base
value for Composite Extension events will be stored.</p>

<p>error_base_return Pointer to integer where the base
value for Composite Extension errors will be stored.</p>

<p>major_version_return Pointer to integer where the major
version of the Composite Extension supported by the X server
will be stored.</p>

<p>minor_version_return Pointer to integer where the minor
version of the Composite Extension supported by the X server
will be stored.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID to operate on.</p>

<p>update Specifies the mode for updating the window
contents. Must be either CompositeRedirectAutomatic or
CompositeRedirectManual.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS XCompositeQueryExtension
XCompositeQueryExtension determines if the Composite
Extension is available on the given display. It returns True
if the extension is supported, otherwise False. If the
extension is present, the base values for events and errors
are returned, and can be used to decode incoming event and
error values.</p>

<p>XCompositeQueryVersion XCompositeQueryVersion determines
if the X Server supports a version of the X Composite
Extension which is compatible with the client library. A
non-zero Status is returned if a compatible version of the
extension is supported, otherwise a zero Status is returned.
If the extension is supported, the major and minor version
numbers are returned to indicate the level of Composite
Extension support. No other XComposite functions (except
XCompositeQueryExtension) may be called before this
function. If a client violates this rule, the effects of all
subsequent XComposite calls that it makes are undefined.</p>

<p>XCompositeVersion XCompositeVersion returns the version
of the X Composite library. The version number is encoded
as: (major * 10000) + (minor * 100) + revision</p>

<p>For example, version 1.4.6 would be encoded as the
integer 10406.</p>

<p>XCompositeRedirectWindow XCompositeRedirectWindow
requests the X server to direct the hierarchy starting at
window to off-screen storage. The update argument specifies
whether the contents are mirrored to the parent window
automatically or not. Only one client at a time may specify
an update type of CompositeRedirectManual, another attempt
will result in a BadAccess error. When all clients enabling
redirection terminate, the redirection will automatically be
disabled.</p>

<p>The root window may not be redirected. Doing so results
in a BadMatch error. Specifying an invalid window id will
result in a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>XCompositeRedirectSubwindows
XCompositeRedirectSubwindows requests the X server to
redirect hierarchies starting at all current and future
children of window as in XCompositeRedirectWindow. If update
is CompositeRedirectManual, then painting of the window
background during window manipulation and ClearArea requests
is inhibited.</p>

<p>XCompositeUnredirectWindow XCompositeUnredirectWindow
requests the X server to terminate redirection of window. If
the specified window was not selected for redirection by the
current client, a BadValue error results.</p>

<p>XCompositeUnredirectSubwindows
XCompositeUnredirectWindow requests the X server to
terminate redirection of all children of window. If the
specified window was not selected for sub-redirection by the
current client, a BadValue error results.</p>

<p>XCompositeCreateRegionFromBorderClip
XCompositeCreateRegionFromBorderClip creates a region
containing the &quot;usual&quot; border clip value; that is
the area of the window clipped against siblings and the
parent. This region can be used to restrict rendering to
suitable areas while updating only a single window. The
region is copied at the moment the request is executed;
future changes to the window hierarchy will not be reflected
in this region.</p>

<p>XCompositeNameWindowPixmap XCompositeNameWindowPixmap
creates and returns a pixmap id that serves as a reference
to the off-screen storage for window. This pixmap will
remain allocated until freed, even if the window is
unmapped, reconfigured or destroyed. However, the window
will get a new pixmap allocated each time it is mapped or
resized, so this function will need to be reinvoked for the
client to continue to refer to the storage holding the
current window contents. Generates a BadMatch error if
window is not redirected or is not visible.</p>

<p>The X server must support at least version 0.2 of the
Composite Extension for XCompositeNameWindowPixmap.</p>

<p>XCompositeGetOverlayWindow XCompositeGetOverlayWindow
returns the window ID of the Composite Overlay Window for
the screen specified by the argument window. This function
notifies the X server that the client wishes to use the
Composite Overlay Window of this screen. If this Composite
Overlay Window has not yet been mapped, it is mapped by this
request.</p>

<p>The Composite Overlay Window for a particular screen
will be unmapped when all clients who have called this
function have either called XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow
for that screen, or terminated their connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>The X server must support at least version 0.3 of the
Composite Extension for XCompositeGetOverlayWindow.</p>

<p>XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow This request specifies
that the client is no longer using the Composite Overlay
Window on the screen specified by the argument window. A
screen s Composite Overlay Window is unmapped when there are
no longer any clients using it.</p>

<p>The X server must support at least version 0.3 of the
Composite Extension for XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow.</p>
