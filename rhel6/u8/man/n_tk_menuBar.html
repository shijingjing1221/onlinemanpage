_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and
earlier releases to help man- age pulldown menus and to
implement keyboard traversal of menus. In Tk 4.0 and later
releases they are no longer needed. Stubs for these pro-
cedures have been retained for backward compatibility, but
they have no effect. You should remove calls to these
procedures from your code, since eventually the procedures
will go away.</p>

<p>From Tk 8.0 onwards, you should instead construct your
menubar as a normal menu and then attach it to the toplevel
of your choice using the -menu option of that widget.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO menu(n), toplevel(n)</p>
