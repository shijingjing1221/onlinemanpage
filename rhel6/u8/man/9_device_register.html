DEVICE_REGISTER(9)</p>

<p>NAME device_register - register a device with the
system.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int device_register(struct device * dev);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev pointer to the device structure</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This happens in two clean steps - initialize
the device and add it to the system. The two steps can be
called separately, but this is the easiest and most common.
I.e. you should only call the two helpers separately if have
a clearly defined need to use and refcount the device before
it is added to the hierarchy.</p>

<p>NOTE _Never_ directly free dev after calling this
function, even if it returned an error! Always use
put_device to give up the reference initialized in this
function instead.</p>
