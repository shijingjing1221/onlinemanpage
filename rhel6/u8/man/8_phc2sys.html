<p>NAME phc2sys - synchronize two or more clocks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS phc2sys -a [ -r ] [ -r ] [ options ] phc2sys [
-d pps-device ] [ -s device ] [ -c device ] [ -O offset ] [
-w ] [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION phc2sys is a program which synchronizes two
or more clocks in the sys- tem. Typically, it is used to
synchronize the system clock to a PTP hardware clock (PHC),
which itself is synchronized by the ptp4l(8) pro- gram.</p>

<p>With the -a option, the clocks to synchronize are
fetched from the run- ning ptp4l daemon and the direction of
synchronization automatically follows changes of the PTP
port states.</p>

<p>Manual configuration is also possible. When using manual
configuration, two synchronization modes are supported, one
uses a pulse per second (PPS) signal provided by the source
clock and the other mode reads time from the source clock
directly. Some clocks can be used in both modes, the mode
which will synchronize the slave clock with better accuracy
depends on hardware and driver implementation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Read the clocks to synchronize from running
ptp4l and follow changes in the port states, adjusting the
synchronization direc- tion automatically. The system clock
(CLOCK_REALTIME) is not synchronized, unless the -r option
is also specified.</p>

<p>-r Only valid together with the -a option. Instructs
phc2sys to also synchronize the system clock
(CLOCK_REALTIME). By default, the system clock is not
considered as a possible time source. If you want the system
clock to be eligible to become a time source, specify the -r
option twice.</p>

<p>-d pps-device Specify the PPS device of the master clock
(e.g. /dev/pps0). With this option the PPS synchronization
mode is used instead of the direct mode. As the PPS signal
does not specify time and only marks start of a second, the
slave clock should be already close to the correct time
before phc2sys is started or the -s option should be used
too. With the -s option the PPS signal of the master clock
is enabled automatically, otherwise it has to be enabled
before phc2sys is started (e.g. by running echo 1 &gt;
/sys/class/ptp/ptp0/pps_enable). This option can be used
only with the system clock as the slave clock. Not
compatible with the -a option.</p>

<p>-s device Specify the master clock by device (e.g.
/dev/ptp0) or interface (e.g. eth0) or by name (e.g.
CLOCK_REALTIME for the system clock). When this option is
used together with the -d option, the master clock is used
only to correct the offset by whole number of seconds, which
cannot be fixed with PPS alone. Not compatible with the -a
option.</p>

<p>-i interface Performs the exact same function as -s for
compatibility rea- sons. Previously enabled specifying
master clock by network interface. However, this can now be
done using -s and this option is no longer necessary. As
such it has been deprecated, and should no longer be
used.</p>

<p>-c device Specify the slave clock by device (e.g.
/dev/ptp1) or interface (e.g. eth1) or by name. The default
is CLOCK_REALTIME (the sys- tem clock). Not compatible with
the -a option.</p>

<p>-E servo Specify which clock servo should be used. Valid
values are pi for a PI controller, linreg for an adaptive
controller using linear regression, and ntpshm for the NTP
SHM reference clock to allow another process to synchronize
the local clock. The default is pi.</p>

<p>-P kp Specify the proportional constant of the PI
controller. The default is 0.7.</p>

<p>-I ki Specify the integral constant of the PI
controller. The default is 0.3.</p>

<p>-S step Specify the step threshold of the servo. It is
the maximum off- set that the servo corrects by changing the
clock frequency instead of stepping the clock. The clock is
stepped on start regardless of the option if the offset is
larger than 20 microseconds (unless the -F option is used).
It s specified in seconds. The value of 0.0 disables
stepping after the start. The default is 0.0.</p>

<p>-F step Specify the step threshold applied only on the
first update. It is the maximum offset that is corrected by
adjusting clock. Its specified in seconds. The value of 0.0
disables stepping on start. The default is 0.00002 (20
microseconds).</p>

<p>-R update-rate Specify the slave clock update rate when
running in the direct synchronization mode. The default is 1
per second.</p>

<p>-N phc-num Specify the number of master clock readings
per one slave clock update. Only the fastest reading is used
to update the slave clock, this is useful to minimize the
error caused by random delays in scheduling and bus
utilization. The default is 5.</p>

<p>-O offset Specify the offset between the slave and
master times in sec- onds. Not compatible with the -a
option. See TIME SCALE USAGE below.</p>

<p>-L freq-limit The maximum allowed frequency offset
between uncorrected clock and the system monotonic clock in
parts per billion (ppb). This is used as a sanity check of
the synchronized clock. When a larger offset is measured, a
warning message will be printed and the servo will be reset.
When set to 0, the sanity check is dis- abled. The default
is 200000000 (20%).</p>

<p>-M segment The number of the SHM segment used by ntpshm
servo. The default is 0.</p>

<p>-u summary-updates Specify the number of clock updates
included in summary statis- tics. The statistics include
offset root mean square (RMS), max- imum absolute offset,
frequency offset mean and standard deviation, and mean of
the delay in clock readings and standard deviation. The
units are nanoseconds and parts per billion (ppb). If zero,
the individual samples are printed instead of the
statistics. The messages are printed at the LOG_INFO level.
The default is 0 (disabled).</p>

<p>-w Wait until ptp4l is in a synchronized state. If the
-O option is not used, also keep the offset between the
slave and master times updated according to the
currentUtcOffset value obtained from ptp4l and the direction
of the clock synchronization. Not compatible with the -a
option.</p>

<p>-n domain-number Specify the domain number used by
ptp4l. The default is 0.</p>

<p>-x When a leap second is announced, dont apply it in the
kernel by stepping the clock, but let the servo correct the
one-second offset slowly by changing the clock frequency
(unless the -S option is used).</p>

<p>-z uds-address Specifies the address of the servers UNIX
domain socket. The default is /var/run/ptp4l.</p>

<p>-l print-level Set the maximum syslog level of messages
which should be printed or sent to the system logger. The
default is 6 (LOG_INFO).</p>

<p>-m Print messages to the standard output.</p>

<p>-q Dont send messages to the system logger.</p>

<p>-h Display a help message.</p>

<p>-v Prints the software version and exits.</p>

<p>TIME SCALE USAGE Ptp4l uses either PTP time scale or UTC
(Coordinated Universal Time) time scale. PTP time scale is
continuous and shifted against UTC by a few tens of seconds
as PTP time scale does not apply leap seconds.</p>

<p>In hardware time stamping mode, ptp4l announces use of
PTP time scale and PHC is used for the stamps. That means
PHC must follow PTP time scale while system clock follows
UTC. Time offset between these two is maintained by
phc2sys.</p>

<p>Phc2sys acquires the offset value either by reading it
from ptp4l when -a or -w is in effect or from command line
when -O is supplied. Fail- ure to maintain the correct
offset can result in local system clock being off some
seconds to domain master system clock when in slave mode, or
incorect PTP time announced to the network in case the host
is the domain master.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Synchronize time automatically according to the
current ptp4l state, synchronize the system clock to the
remote master.</p>

<p>phc2sys -a -r</p>

<p>Same as above, but when the host becomes the domain
master, synchronize time in the domain to its system
clock.</p>

<p>phc2sys -a -rr</p>

<p>The host is a domain master, PTP clock is synchronized
to system clock and the time offset is obtained from ptp4l.
Phc2sys waits for ptp4l to get at least one port in master
or slave mode before starting the syn- chronization.</p>

<p>phc2sys -c /dev/ptp0 -s CLOCK_REALTIME -w</p>

<p>Same as above, time offset is provided on command line
and phc2sys does not wait for ptp4l.</p>

<p>phc2sys -c /dev/ptp0 -s CLOCK_REALTIME -O 35</p>

<p>The host is in slave mode, system clock is synchronized
from PTP clock, phc2sys waits for ptp4l and the offset is
set automatically.</p>

<p>phc2sys -s /dev/ptp0 -w</p>

<p>Same as above, PTP clock id is read from the network
interface, the offset is provided on command line phc2sys
does not wait.</p>

<p>phc2sys -s eth0 -O -35</p>
