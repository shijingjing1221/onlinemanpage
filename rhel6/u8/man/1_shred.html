<p>NAME shred - overwrite a file to hide its contents, and
optionally delete it</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS shred [OPTION]... FILE...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly,
in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware
probing to recover the data.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>-f, --force change permissions to allow writing if
necessary</p>

<p>-n, --iterations=N overwrite N times instead of the
default (3)</p>

<p>--random-source=FILE get random bytes from FILE</p>

<p>-s, --size=N shred this many bytes (suffixes like K, M,
G accepted)</p>

<p>-u, --remove truncate and remove file after
overwriting</p>

<p>-v, --verbose show progress</p>

<p>-x, --exact do not round file sizes up to the next full
block;</p>

<p>this is the default for non-regular files</p>

<p>-z, --zero add a final overwrite with zeros to hide
shredding</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>If FILE is -, shred standard output.</p>

<p>Delete FILE(s) if --remove (-u) is specified. The
default is not to remove the files because it is common to
operate on device files like /dev/hda, and those files
usually should not be removed. When operat- ing on regular
files, most people use the --remove option.</p>

<p>CAUTION: Note that shred relies on a very important
assumption: that the file system overwrites data in place.
This is the traditional way to do things, but many modern
file system designs do not satisfy this assumption. The
following are examples of file systems on which shred is not
effective, or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file
sys- tem modes:</p>

<p>* log-structured or journaled file systems, such as
those supplied with AIX and Solaris (and JFS, ReiserFS, XFS,
Ext3, etc.)</p>

<p>* file systems that write redundant data and carry on
even if some writes fail, such as RAID-based file
systems</p>

<p>* file systems that make snapshots, such as Network
Appliances NFS server</p>

<p>* file systems that cache in temporary locations, such
as NFS version 3 clients</p>

<p>* compressed file systems</p>

<p>In the case of ext3 file systems, the above disclaimer
applies (and shred is thus of limited effectiveness) only in
data=journal mode, which journals file data in addition to
just metadata. In both the data=ordered (default) and
data=writeback modes, shred works as usual. Ext3 journaling
modes can be changed by adding the data=something option to
the mount options for a particular file system in the
/etc/fstab file, as documented in the mount man page (man
mount).</p>

<p>In addition, file system backups and remote mirrors may
contain copies of the file that cannot be removed, and that
will allow a shredded file to be recovered later.</p>
