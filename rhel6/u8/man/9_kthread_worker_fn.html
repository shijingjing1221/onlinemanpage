KTHREAD_WORKER_FN(9)</p>

<p>NAME kthread_worker_fn - kthread function to process
kthread_worker</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int kthread_worker_fn(void * worker_ptr);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS worker_ptr pointer to initialized
kthread_worker</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function can be used as threadfn to
kthread_create or kthread_run with worker_ptr argument
pointing to an initialized kthread_worker. The started
kthread will process work_list until the it is stopped with
kthread_stop. A kthread can also call this function directly
after extra initialization.</p>

<p>Different kthreads can be used for the same
kthread_worker as long as there&acute;s only one kthread
attached to it at any given time. A kthread_worker without
an attached kthread simply collects queued
kthread_works.</p>
