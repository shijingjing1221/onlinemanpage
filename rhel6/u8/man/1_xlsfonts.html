<p>NAME xlsfonts - server font list displayer for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xlsfonts [-display host:dpy] [-l] [-ll] [-lll]
[-m] [-C] [-1] [-w width] [-n columns] [-u] [-o] [-fn
pattern]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xlsfonts lists the fonts that match the
given pattern. The wildcard character &quot;*&quot; may be
used to match any sequence of characters (includ- ing none),
and &quot;?&quot; to match any single character. If no
pattern is given, &quot;*&quot; is assumed.</p>

<p>The &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; characters must be
quoted to prevent them from being expanded by the shell.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -display host:dpy This option specifies the X
server to contact.</p>

<p>-d host:dpy Same as -display host:dpy.</p>

<p>-l Lists some attributes of the font on one line in
addition to its name.</p>

<p>-ll Lists font properties in addition to -l output.</p>

<p>-lll Lists character metrics in addition to -ll
output.</p>

<p>-m This option indicates that long listings should also
print the minimum and maximum bounds of each font.</p>

<p>-C This option indicates that listings should use
multiple columns. This is the same as -n 0.</p>

<p>-1 This option indicates that listings should use a
single column. This is the same as -n 1.</p>

<p>-w width This option specifies the width in characters
that should be used in figuring out how many columns to
print. The default is 79.</p>

<p>-n columns This option specifies the number of columns
to use in displaying the output. By default, it will attempt
to fit as many columns of font names into the number of
character specified by -w width.</p>

<p>-u This option indicates that the output should be left
unsorted.</p>

<p>-o This option indicates that xlsfonts should do an
OpenFont (and QueryFont, if appropriate) rather than a
ListFonts. This is useful if ListFonts or ListFontsWithInfo
fail to list a known font (as is the case with some scaled
font systems).</p>

<p>-fn pattern This option specifies the font name pattern
to match.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), Xserver(1), xset(1), xfd(1), X Logical
Font Description Conven- tions</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY DISPLAY must be set to get the
default host and display to use.</p>

<p>BUGS Doing xlsfonts -l can tie up your server for a very
long time. This is really a bug with single-threaded
non-preemptable servers, not with this program.</p>
