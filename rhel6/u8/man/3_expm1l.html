<p>EXPM1(3) Linux Programmer s Manual EXPM1(3)</p>

<p>NAME expm1, expm1f, expm1l - exponential minus 1</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double expm1(double x); float expm1f(float x); long
double expm1l(long double x);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>expm1(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
&gt;= 500 || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99 expm1f(),
expm1l(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;=
600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION expm1(x) returns a value equivalent to</p>

<p>exp(x) - 1</p>

<p>It is computed in a way that is accurate even if the
value of x is near zeroa case where exp(x) - 1 would be
inaccurate due to subtraction of two numbers that are nearly
equal.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return exp(x) -
1.</p>

<p>If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If x is +0 (-0), +0 (-0) is returned.</p>

<p>If x is positive infinity, positive infinity is
returned.</p>

<p>If x is negative infinity, -1 is returned.</p>

<p>If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the
functions return -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, or -HUGE_VALL,
respectively.</p>

<p>ERRORS See math_error(7) for information on how to
determine whether an error has occurred when calling these
functions.</p>

<p>The following errors can occur:</p>

<p>Range error, overflow An overflow floating-point
exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.</p>

<p>These functions do not set errno.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS For some large negative x values (where the
function result approaches -1), expm1() raises a bogus
underflow floating-point exception.</p>

<p>For some large positive x values, expm1() raises a bogus
invalid float- ing-point exception in addition to the
expected overflow exception, and returns a NaN instead of
positive infinity.</p>
