<p>NAME pbmtopk - convert a PBM image into a packed (PK)
format font</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtopk pkfile[.pk] tfmfile[.tfm] resolution
[-s designsize] [-p num param...] [-C codingscheme] [-F
family] [-f optfile] [-c num] [-W width] [-H height] [-D
depth] [-I ital] [-h horiz] [-v vert] [-x xoff] [-y yoff]
[pbmfile ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtopk reads PBM images as input and produces a packed
(PK) font file and a TFM (TeX font metric) file as output.
The resolution parameter indicates the resolution of the
font, in dots per inch. If the filename - is used for any of
the filenames, pbmtopk uses Standard Input or Standard
Output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s designsize Sets the design size of the font,
in TeX s points (72.27pt to the inch). The default design
size is 1. The TFM parameters are given as multiples of the
design size.</p>

<p>-p num param... Sets the first num font parameters for
the font. The first seven parameters are the slant,
interword spacing, interword space stretchability, interword
space shrinkability, x-height, quad width, and post-sentence
extra space of the font. Math and sym- bol fonts may have
more parameters; see The TeXbook for a list of these.
Reasonable default values are chosen for parameters which
are not specified.</p>

<p>-C codingscheme Sets the coding scheme comment in the
TFM file.</p>

<p>-F family Sets the font family comment in the TFM
file.</p>

<p>-f optfile Reads the file optfile, which should contain
a lines of the form:</p>

<p>filename xoff yoff horiz vert width height depth
ital</p>

<p>The PBM files specified by the filename parameters are
inserted consecutively in the font with the specified
attributes. If any of the attributes are omitted, or
replaced with * , a default value will be calculated from
the size of the bitmap. The set- tings of the -W, -H, -D,
-I, -h, -v, -x, and -y options do not affected characters
created in this way. The character number can be changed by
including a line starting with =, followed by the new
number. Lines beginning with % or # are ignored.</p>

<p>-c num Sets the character number of the next bitmap
encountered to num.</p>

<p>-W width Sets the TFM width of the next character to
width (in design size multiples).</p>

<p>-H height Sets the TFM height of the next character to
height (in design size multiples).</p>

<p>-D depth Sets the TFM depth of the next character to
depth (in design size multiples).</p>

<p>-I ital Sets the italic correction of the next character
to ital (in design size multiples).</p>

<p>-h horiz Sets the horizontal escapement of the next
character to horiz (in pixels).</p>

<p>-v vert Sets the vertical escapement of the next
character to vert (in pixels).</p>

<p>-x xoff Sets the horizontal offset of the next character
to xoff (in pixels).</p>

<p>-y yoff Sets the vertical offset of the next character
to yoff (in pix- els, from the top row).</p>
