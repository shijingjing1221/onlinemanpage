<p>NAME label - Create and manipulate label widgets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS label pathName ?options?</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -activebackground -disabledforeground
-padx -activeforeground -font -pady -anchor -foreground
-relief -background -highlightbackground -takefocus -bitmap
-highlightcolor -text -borderwidth -highlightthickness
-textvariable -compound -image -underline -cursor -justify

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-height
Database Name: height Database Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies a desired height for the label. If an image or
bitmap is being displayed in the label then the value is in
screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in lines of text. If this
option is not specified, the labels desired height is
computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text being
displayed in it.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-state Database Name: state Database
Class: State</p>

<p>Specifies one of three states for the label: normal,
active, or disabled. In normal state the button is displayed
using the foreground and background options. In active state
the label is displayed using the activeForeground and
activeBackground options. In the disabled state the
disabledForeground and back- ground options determine how
the button is displayed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies a desired width for the label. If an image or
bitmap is being displayed in the label then the value is in
screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in characters. If this option
is not specified, the label s desired width is computed from
the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in
it.

<p>DESCRIPTION The label command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a label
widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
con- figure aspects of the label such as its colors, font,
text, and initial relief. The label command returns its
pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named pathName, but pathNames
parent must exist.</p>

<p>A label is a widget that displays a textual string,
bitmap or image. If text is displayed, it must all be in a
single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the screen
(if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of
the wrapLength option) and one of the char- acters may
optionally be underlined using the underline option. The
label can be manipulated in a few simple ways, such as
changing its relief or text, using the commands described
below.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The label command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
The following commands are possible for label widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the label command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the label command.</p>

<p>BINDINGS When a new label is created, it has no default
event bindings: labels are not intended to be
interactive.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE # Make the widgets label .t -text &quot;This
widget is at the top&quot; -bg red label .b -text &quot;This
widget is at the bottom&quot; -bg green label .l -text
&quot;Left0and0ide&quot; label .r -text
&quot;Right0and0ide&quot; text .mid # Lay them out pack .t
-side top -fill x pack .b -side bottom -fill x pack .l -side
left -fill y pack .r -side right -fill y pack .mid -expand 1
-fill both</p>
