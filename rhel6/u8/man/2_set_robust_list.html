<p>GET_ROBUST_LIST(2) Linux System Calls
GET_ROBUST_LIST(2)</p>

<p>NAME get_robust_list, set_robust_list - get/set the list
of robust futexes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/futex.h&gt; #include
&lt;syscall.h&gt;</p>

<p>long get_robust_list(int pid, struct robust_list_head
**head_ptr, size_t *len_ptr); long set_robust_list(struct
robust_list_head *head, size_t len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The robust futex implementation needs to
maintain per-thread lists of robust futexes which are
unlocked when the thread exits. These lists are managed in
user space, the kernel is only notified about the loca- tion
of the head of the list.</p>

<p>get_robust_list returns the head of the robust futex
list of the thread with TID defined by the pid argument. If
pid is 0, the returned head belongs to the current thread.
head_ptr is the pointer to the head of the list of robust
futexes. The get_robust_list function stores the address of
the head of the list here. len_ptr is the pointer to the
length variable. get_robust_list stores sizeof(**head_ptr)
here.</p>

<p>set_robust_list sets the head of the list of robust
futexes owned by the current thread to head. len is the size
of *head.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The set_robust_list and get_robust_list
functions return zero when the operation is successful, an
error code otherwise.</p>

<p>ERRORS The set_robust_list function fails with EINVAL if
the len value does not match the size of structure struct
robust_list_head expected by kernel.</p>

<p>The get_robust_list function fails with EPERM if the
current process does not have permission to see the robust
futex list of the thread with the TID pid, ESRCH if a thread
with the TID pid does not exist, or EFAULT if the head of
the robust futex list cant be stored in the space specified
by the head argument.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE A thread can have only one robust
futex list; therefore applications that wish to use this
functionality should use robust mutexes provided by
glibc.</p>

<p>The system call is only available for debugging purposes
and is not needed for normal operations.</p>

<p>Both system calls are not available to application
programs as func- tions; they can be called using the
syscall(3) function.</p>
