<p>INDENT(1L) INDENT(1L)</p>

<p>NAME indent - changes the appearance of a C program by
inserting or deleting whitespace.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS indent [options] [input-files]</p>

<p>indent [options] [single-input-file] [-o
output-file]</p>

<p>indent --version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This man page is generated from the file
indent.texinfo. This is Edi- tion of &quot;The indent
Manual&quot;, for Indent Version , last updated .</p>

<p>The indent program can be used to make code easier to
read. It can also convert from one style of writing C to
another.</p>

<p>indent understands a substantial amount about the syntax
of C, but it also attempts to cope with incomplete and
misformed syntax.</p>

<p>In version 1.2 and more recent versions, the GNU style
of indenting is the default.</p>

<p>INVOKING INDENT As of version 1.3, the format of the
indent command is:</p>

<p>indent [options] [input-files]</p>

<p>indent [options] [single-input-file] [-o
output-file]</p>

<p>This format is different from earlier versions and other
versions of indent.</p>

<p>In the first form, one or more input files are
specified. indent makes a backup copy of each file, and the
original file is replaced with its indented version. See
BACKUP FILES, for an explanation of how backups are
made.</p>

<p>In the second form, only one input file is specified. In
this case, or when the standard input is used, you may
specify an output file after the &lsquo;-o&acute;
option.</p>

<p>To cause indent to write to standard output, use the
&lsquo;-st&acute; option. This is only allowed when there is
only one input file, or when the standard input is used.</p>

<p>If no input files are named, the standard input is read
for input. Also, if a filename named &lsquo;-&acute; is
specified, then the standard input is read.</p>

<p>As an example, each of the following commands will input
the program &lsquo;slithy_toves.c&acute; and write its
indented text to &lsquo;slithy_toves.out&acute;:</p>

<p>indent slithy_toves.c -o slithy_toves.out</p>

<p>indent -st slithy_toves.c &gt; slithy_toves.out</p>

<p>cat slithy_toves.c | indent -o slithy_toves.out</p>

<p>Most other options to indent control how programs are
formatted. As of version 1.2, indent also recognizes a long
name for each option name. Long options are prefixed by
either &lsquo;--&acute; or &lsquo;+&acute;. [
&lsquo;+&acute; is being super- seded by &lsquo;--&acute; to
maintain consistency with the POSIX standard.] In most of
this document, the traditional, short names are used for the
sake of brevity. See OPTION SUMMARY, for a list of options,
including both long and short names.</p>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<p>indent -br test/metabolism.c -l85</p>

<p>This will indent the program
&lsquo;test/metabolism.c&acute; using the &lsquo;-br&acute;
and &lsquo;-l85&acute; options, write the output back to
&lsquo;test/metabolism.c&acute;, and write the original
contents of &lsquo;test/metabolism.c&acute; to a backup file
in the directory &lsquo;test&acute;.</p>

<p>Equivalent invocations using long option names for this
example would be:</p>

<p>indent --braces-on-if-line --line-length185
test/metabolism.c</p>

<p>indent +braces-on-if-line +line-length185
test/metabolism.c</p>

<p>If you find that you often use indent with the same
options, you may put those options into a file named
&lsquo;.indent.pro&acute;. indent will look for a profile
file in three places. First it will check the environment
variable INDENT_PROFILE. If that exists its value is
expected to name the file that is to be used. If the
environment variable does not exist, indent looks for
&lsquo;.indent.pro&acute; in the current directory and use
that if found. Finally indent will search your home
directory for &lsquo;.indent.pro&acute; and use that file if
it is found. This behaviour is different from that of other
versions of indent, which load both files if they both
exist.</p>

<p>The format of &lsquo;.indent.pro&acute; is simply a list
of options, just as they would appear on the command line,
separated by white space (tabs, spaces, and newlines).
Options in &lsquo;.indent.pro&acute; may be surrounded by C
or C++ comments, in which case they are ignored.</p>

<p>Command line switches are handled after processing
&lsquo;.indent.pro&acute;. Options specified later override
arguments specified earlier, with one exception: Explicitly
specified options always override background options (See
COMMON STYLES). You can prevent indent from reading an
&lsquo;.indent.pro&acute; file by specifying the
&lsquo;-npro&acute; option.</p>

<p>BACKUP FILES As of version 1.3, GNU indent makes
GNU-style backup files, the same way GNU Emacs does. This
means that either simple or numbered backup filenames may be
made.</p>

<p>Simple backup file names are generated by appending a
suffix to the original file name. The default for this
suffix is the one-character string &lsquo;~&acute; (tilde).
Thus, the backup file for &lsquo;python.c&acute; would be
&lsquo;python.c~&acute;.</p>

<p>Instead of the default, you may specify any string as a
suffix by set- ting the environment variable
SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX to your preferred suffix.</p>

<p>Numbered backup versions of a file
&lsquo;momeraths.c&acute; look like
&lsquo;momeraths.c.~23~&acute;, where 23 is the version of
this particular backup. When making a numbered backup of the
file &lsquo;src/momeraths.c&acute;, the backup file will be
named &lsquo;src/momeraths.c.~V~&acute;, where V is one
greater than the highest version currently existing in the
directory &lsquo;src&acute;. The environment variable
VERSION_WIDTH controls the number of digits, using left zero
padding when necessary. For instance, setting this variable
to &quot;2&quot; will lead to the backup file being named
&lsquo;momeraths.c.~04~&acute;.</p>

<p>The type of backup file made is controlled by the value
of the environ- ment variable VERSION_CONTROL. If it is the
string &lsquo;simple&acute;, then only simple backups will
be made. If its value is the string &lsquo;numbered&acute;,
then numbered backups will be made. If its value is
&lsquo;numbered-exist- ing&acute;, then numbered backups
will be made if there already exist num- bered backups for
the file being indented; otherwise, a simple backup is made.
If VERSION_CONTROL is not set, then indent assumes the
behaviour of &lsquo;numbered-existing&acute;.</p>

<p>Other versions of indent use the suffix
&lsquo;.BAK&acute; in naming backup files. This behaviour
can be emulated by setting SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX to
&lsquo;.BAK&acute;.</p>

<p>Note also that other versions of indent make backups in
the current directory, rather than in the directory of the
source file as GNU indent now does.</p>

<p>COMMON STYLES There are several common styles of C code,
including the GNU style, the Kernighan &amp; Ritchie style,
and the original Berkeley style. A style may be selected
with a single background option, which specifies a set of
values for all other options. However, explicitly specified
options always override options implied by a background
option.</p>

<p>As of version 1.2, the default style of GNU indent is
the GNU style. Thus, it is no longer necessary to specify
the option &lsquo;-gnu&acute; to obtain this format,
although doing so will not cause an error. Option set- tings
which correspond to the GNU style are:</p>

<p>-nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -bl -bli2 -bls -ncdb -nce -cp1 -cs
-di2 -ndj -nfc1 -nfca -hnl -i2 -ip5 -lp -pcs -nprs -psl -saf
-sai -saw -nsc -nsob</p>

<p>The GNU coding style is that preferred by the GNU
project. It is the style that the GNU Emacs C mode
encourages and which is used in the C portions of GNU Emacs.
(People interested in writing programs for Project GNU
should get a copy of &quot;The GNU Coding Standards&quot;,
which also covers semantic and portability issues such as
memory usage, the size of integers, etc.)</p>

<p>The Kernighan &amp; Ritchie style is used throughout
their well-known book &quot;The C Programming
Language&quot;. It is enabled with the &lsquo;-kr&acute;
option. The Kernighan &amp; Ritchie style corresponds to the
following set of options:</p>

<p>-nbad -bap -bbo -nbc -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce -ci4
-cli0 -cp33 -cs -d0 -di1 -nfc1 -nfca -hnl -i4 -ip0 -l75 -lp
-npcs -nprs -npsl -saf -sai -saw -nsc -nsob -nss</p>

<p>Kernighan &amp; Ritchie style does not put comments to
the right of code in the same column at all times (nor does
it use only one space to the right of the code), so for this
style indent has arbitrarily chosen column 33.</p>

<p>The style of the original Berkeley indent may be
obtained by specifying &lsquo;-orig&acute; (or by specifying
&lsquo;--original&acute;, using the long option name). This
style is equivalent to the following settings:</p>

<p>-nbad -nbap -bbo -bc -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -cdb -ce -ci4
-cli0 -cp33 -di16 -fc1 -fca -hnl -i4 -ip4 -l75 -lp -npcs
-nprs -psl -saf -sai -saw -sc -nsob -nss -ts8</p>

<p>The Linux style is used in the linux kernel code and
drivers. Code gen- erally has to follow the Linux coding
style to be accepted. This style is equivalent to the
following settings:</p>

<p>-nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -hnl -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce
-ci4 -cli0 -d0 -di1 -nfc1 -i8 -ip0 -l80 -lp -npcs -nprs
-npsl -sai -saf -saw -ncs -nsc -sob -nfca -cp33 -ss -ts8
-il1</p>

<p>BLANK LINES Various programming styles use blank lines
in different places. indent has a number of options to
insert or delete blank lines in specific places.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bad&acute; option causes indent to force a
blank line after every block of declarations. The
&lsquo;-nbad&acute; option causes indent not to force such
blank lines.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bap&acute; option forces a blank line after
every procedure body. The &lsquo;-nbap&acute; option forces
no such blank line.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bbb&acute; option forces a blank line before
every boxed comment (See COMMENTS.) The &lsquo;-nbbb&acute;
option does not force such blank lines.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-sob&acute; option causes indent to swallow
optional blank lines (that is, any optional blank lines
present in the input will be removed from the output). If
the &lsquo;-nsob&acute; is specified, any blank lines
present in the input file will be copied to the output
file.</p>

<p>--blank-lines-after-declarations The &lsquo;-bad&acute;
option forces a blank line after every block of declara-
tions. The &lsquo;-nbad&acute; option does not add any such
blank lines.</p>

<p>For example, given the input char *foo; char *bar; /*
This separates blocks of declarations. */ int baz;</p>

<p>indent -bad produces</p>

<p>char *foo; char *bar;</p>

<p>/* This separates blocks of declarations. */ int
baz;</p>

<p>and indent -nbad produces</p>

<p>char *foo; char *bar; /* This separates blocks of
declarations. */ int baz;</p>

<p>--blank-lines-after-procedures The &lsquo;-bap&acute;
option forces a blank line after every procedure body.</p>

<p>For example, given the input</p>

<p>int foo () { puts(&quot;Hi&quot;); } /* The procedure
bar is even less interesting. */ char * bar () {
puts(&quot;Hello&quot;); }</p>

<p>indent -bap produces</p>

<p>int foo () { puts (&quot;Hi&quot;); }</p>

<p>/* The procedure bar is even less interesting. */ char *
bar () { puts (&quot;Hello&quot;); }</p>

<p>and indent -nbap produces</p>

<p>int foo () { puts (&quot;Hi&quot;); } /* The procedure
bar is even less interesting. */ char * bar () { puts
(&quot;Hello&quot;); }</p>

<p>No blank line will be added after the procedure foo.</p>

<p>COMMENTS indent formats both C and C++ comments. C
comments are begun with &lsquo;/*&acute;, terminated with
&lsquo;*/&acute; and may contain newline characters. C++
comments begin with the delimiter &lsquo;//&acute; and end
at the newline.</p>

<p>indent handles comments differently depending upon their
context. indent attempts to distinguish between comments
which follow state- ments, comments which follow
declarations, comments following prepro- cessor directives,
and comments which are not preceded by code of any sort,
i.e., they begin the text of the line (although not
necessarily in column 1).</p>

<p>indent further distinguishes between comments found
outside of proce- dures and aggregates, and those found
within them. In particular, com- ments beginning a line
found within a procedure will be indented to the column at
which code is currently indented. The exception to this is a
comment beginning in the leftmost column; such a comment is
output at that column.</p>

<p>indent attempts to leave boxed comments unmodified. The
general idea of such a comment is that it is enclosed in a
rectangle or &lsquo;&lsquo;box&acute;&acute; of stars or
dashes to visually set it apart. More precisely, boxed com-
ments are defined as those in which the initial
&lsquo;/*&acute; is followed imme- diately by the character
&lsquo;*&acute;, &lsquo;=&acute;, &lsquo;_&acute;, or
&lsquo;-&acute;, or those in which the beginning comment
delimiter (&lsquo;/*&acute;) is on a line by itself, and the
fol- lowing line begins with a &lsquo;*&acute; in the same
column as the star of the opening delimiter.</p>

<p>Examples of boxed comments are:</p>

<p>/********************** * Comment in a box!! *
**********************/</p>

<p>/* * A different kind of scent, * for a different kind
of comment. */</p>

<p>indent attempts to leave boxed comments exactly as they
are found in the source file. Thus the indentation of the
comment is unchanged, and its length is not checked in any
way. The only alteration made is that an embedded tab
character may be converted into the appropriate number of
spaces.</p>

<p>If the &lsquo;-bbb&acute; option is specified, all such
boxed comments will be pre- ceded by a blank line, unless
such a comment is preceded by code.</p>

<p>Comments which are not boxed comments may be formatted,
which means that the line is broken to fit within a right
margin and left-filled with whitespace. Single newlines are
equivalent to a space, but blank lines (two or more newlines
in a row) are taken to mean a paragraph break. Formatting of
comments which begin after the first column is enabled with
the &lsquo;-fca&acute; option. To format those beginning in
column one, specify &lsquo;-fc1&acute;. Such formatting is
disabled by default.</p>

<p>The right margin for formatting defaults to 78, but may
be changed with the &lsquo;-lc&acute; option. If the margin
specified does not allow the comment to be printed, the
margin will be automatically extended for the dura- tion of
that comment. The margin is not respected if the comment is
not being formatted.</p>

<p>If the comment begins a line (i.e., there is no program
text to its left), it will be indented to the column it was
found in unless the comment is within a block of code. In
that case, such a comment will be aligned with the indented
code of that block (unless the comment began in the first
column). This alignment may be affected by the
&lsquo;-d&acute; option, which specifies an amount by which
such comments are moved to the left, or unindented. For
example, &lsquo;-d2&acute; places comments two spaces to the
left of code. By default, comments are aligned with code,
unless they begin in the first column, in which case they
are left there by default --- to get them aligned with the
code, specify &lsquo;-fc1&acute;.</p>

<p>Comments to the right of code will appear by default in
column 33. This may be changed with one of three options.
&lsquo;-c&acute; will specify the column for comments
following code, &lsquo;-cd&acute; specifies the column for
com- ments following declarations, and &lsquo;-cp&acute;
specifies the column for com- ments following preprocessor
directives #else and #endif. &lsquo;-dj&acute; together with
&lsquo;-cd0&acute; can be used to suppress alignment of
comments to the right of declarations, causing the comment
to follow one tabstop from the end of the declaration.
Normally &lsquo;-cd0&acute; causes &lsquo;-c&acute; to
become effective.</p>

<p>If the code to the left of the comment exceeds the
beginning column, the comment column will be extended to the
next tabstop column past the end of the code, or in the case
of preprocessor directives, to one space past the end of the
directive. This extension lasts only for the output of that
particular comment.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-cdb&acute; option places the comment
delimiters on blank lines. Thus, a single line comment like
/* Loving hug */ can be transformed into:</p>

<p>/* Loving hug */</p>

<p>Stars can be placed at the beginning of multi-line
comments with the &lsquo;-sc&acute; option. Thus, the
single-line comment above can be transformed (with
&lsquo;-cdb -sc&acute;) into:</p>

<p>/* * Loving hug */</p>

<p>STATEMENTS The &lsquo;-br&acute; or &lsquo;-bl&acute;
option specifies how to format braces.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-br&acute; option formats statement braces
like this:</p>

<p>if (x &gt; 0) { x--; }</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bl&acute; option formats them like this:</p>

<p>if (x &gt; 0) { x--; }</p>

<p>If you use the &lsquo;-bl&acute; option, you may also
want to specify the &lsquo;-bli&acute; option. This option
specifies the number of spaces by which braces are indented.
&lsquo;-bli2&acute;, the default, gives the result shown
above. &lsquo;-bli0&acute; results in the following:</p>

<p>if (x &gt; 0) { x--; }</p>

<p>If you are using the &lsquo;-br&acute; option, you
probably want to also use the &lsquo;-ce&acute; option. This
causes the else in an if-then-else construct to cuddle up to
the immediately preceding &lsquo;}&acute;. For example, with
&lsquo;-br -ce&acute; you get the following:</p>

<p>if (x &gt; 0) { x--; } else { fprintf (stderr,
&quot;...something wrong?0); }</p>

<p>With &lsquo;-br -nce&acute; that code would appear
as</p>

<p>if (x &gt; 0) { x--; } else { fprintf (stderr,
&quot;...something wrong?0); }</p>

<p>This causes the while in a do-while loop to cuddle up to
the immedi- ately preceding &lsquo;}&acute;. For example,
with &lsquo;-cdw&acute; you get the following:</p>

<p>do { x--; } while (x);</p>

<p>With &lsquo;-ncdw&acute; that code would appear as</p>

<p>do { x--; } while (x);</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-cli&acute; option specifies the number of
spaces that case labels should be indented to the right of
the containing switch statement.</p>

<p>The default gives code like:</p>

<p>switch (i) { case 0: break; case 1: { ++i; } default:
break; }</p>

<p>Using the &lsquo;-cli2&acute; that would become:</p>

<p>switch (i) { case 0: break; case 1: { ++i; } default:
break; }</p>

<p>The indentation of the braces below a case statement can
be controlled with the &lsquo;-cbin&acute; option. For
example, using &lsquo;-cli2 -cbi0&acute; results in:</p>

<p>switch (i) { case 0: break; case 1: { ++i; } default:
break; }</p>

<p>If a semicolon is on the same line as a for or while
statement, the &lsquo;-ss&acute; option will cause a space
to be placed before the semicolon. This emphasizes the
semicolon, making it clear that the body of the for or while
statement is an empty statement. &lsquo;-nss&acute; disables
this fea- ture.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-pcs&acute; option causes a space to be
placed between the name of the procedure being called and
the &lsquo;(&acute; (for example, puts (&quot;Hi&quot;);.
The &lsquo;-npcs&acute; option would give
puts(&quot;Hi&quot;);).</p>

<p>If the &lsquo;-cs&acute; option is specified, indent
puts a space after a cast operator.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bs&acute; option ensures that there is a
space between the keyword sizeof and its argument. In some
versions, this is known as the &lsquo;Bill_Shannon&acute;
option.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-saf&acute; option forces a space between a
for and the following paren- thesis. This is the
default.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-sai&acute; option forces a space between a
if and the following paren- thesis. This is the default.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-saw&acute; option forces a space between a
while and the following parenthesis. This is the
default.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-prs&acute; option causes all parentheses to
be separated with a space from whatever is between them. For
example, using &lsquo;-prs&acute; results in code like:</p>

<p>while ( ( e_code - s_code ) &lt; ( dec_ind - 1 ) ) {
set_buf_break ( bb_dec_ind ); *e_code++ = &acute; &acute;;
}</p>

<p>DECLARATIONS By default indent will line up identifiers,
in the column specified by the &lsquo;-di&acute; option. For
example, &lsquo;-di16&acute; makes things look like:</p>

<p>int foo; char *bar;</p>

<p>Using a small value (such as one or two) for the
&lsquo;-di&acute; option can be used to cause the
identifiers to be placed in the first available posi- tion;
for example:</p>

<p>int foo; char *bar;</p>

<p>The value given to the &lsquo;-di&acute; option will
still affect variables which are put on separate lines from
their types, for example &lsquo;-di2&acute; will lead
to:</p>

<p>int foo;</p>

<p>If the &lsquo;-bc&acute; option is specified, a newline
is forced after each comma in a declaration. For
example,</p>

<p>int a, b, c;</p>

<p>With the &lsquo;-nbc&acute; option this would look
like</p>

<p>int a, b, c;</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bfda&acute; option causes a newline to be
forced after the comma sepa- rating the arguments of a
function declaration. The arguments will appear at one
indention level deeper than the function declaration. This
is particularly helpful for functions with long argument
lists. The option &lsquo;-bfde&acute; causes a newline to be
forced before the closing bracket of the function
declaration. For both options the &acute;n&acute; setting is
the default: -nbdfa and -nbdfe.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>void foo (int arg1, char arg2, int *arg3, long arg4,
char arg5); With the &lsquo;-bfda&acute; option this would
look like</p>

<p>void foo ( int arg1, char arg2, int *arg3, long arg4,
char arg5);</p>

<p>With, in addition, the &lsquo;-bfde&acute; option this
would look like</p>

<p>void foo ( int arg1, char arg2, int *arg3, long arg4,
char arg5 );</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-psl&acute; option causes the type of a
procedure being defined to be placed on the line before the
name of the procedure. This style is required for the etags
program to work correctly, as well as some of the c-mode
functions of Emacs.</p>

<p>You must use the &lsquo;-T&acute; option to tell indent
the name of all the type- names in your program that are
defined by typedef. &lsquo;-T&acute; can be speci- fied more
than once, and all names specified are used. For example, if
your program contains</p>

<p>typedef unsigned long CODE_ADDR; typedef enum {red,
blue, green} COLOR;</p>

<p>you would use the options &lsquo;-T CODE_ADDR -T
COLOR&acute;.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-brs&acute; or &lsquo;-bls&acute; option
specifies how to format braces in struct declarations. The
&lsquo;-brs&acute; option formats braces like this:</p>

<p>struct foo { int x; };</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bls&acute; option formats them like
this:</p>

<p>struct foo { int x; };</p>

<p>Similarly to the structure brace &lsquo;-brs&acute; and
&lsquo;-bls&acute; options, the function brace options
&lsquo;-brf&acute; or &lsquo;-blf&acute; specify how to
format the braces in function definitions. The
&lsquo;-brf&acute; option formats braces like this:</p>

<p>int one(void) { return 1; };</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-blf&acute; option formats them like
this:</p>

<p>int one(void) { return 1; };</p>

<p>INDENTATION One issue in the formatting of code is how
far each line should be indented from the left margin. When
the beginning of a statement such as if or for is
encountered, the indentation level is increased by the value
specified by the &lsquo;-i&acute; option. For example, use
&lsquo;-i8&acute; to specify an eight character indentation
for each level. When a statement is broken across two lines,
the second line is indented by a number of additional spaces
specified by the &lsquo;-ci&acute; option. &lsquo;-ci&acute;
defaults to 0. However, if the &lsquo;-lp&acute; option is
specified, and a line has a left paren- thesis which is not
closed on that line, then continuation lines will be lined
up to start at the character position just after the left
parenthesis. This processing also applies to &lsquo;[&acute;
and applies to &lsquo;{&acute; when it occurs in
initialization lists. For example, a piece of con- tinued
code might look like this with &lsquo;-nlp -ci3&acute; in
effect:</p>

<p>p1 = first_procedure (second_procedure (p2, p3),
third_procedure (p4, p5));</p>

<p>With &lsquo;-lp&acute; in effect the code looks somewhat
clearer:</p>

<p>p1 = first_procedure (second_procedure (p2, p3),
third_procedure (p4, p5));</p>

<p>When a statement is broken in between two or more paren
pairs (...), each extra pair causes the indentation level
extra indentation:</p>

<p>if ((((i &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; k &gt; 0) || p == 0)
&amp;&amp; q == 1) || n = 0)</p>

<p>The option &lsquo;-ipN&acute; can be used to set the
extra offset per paren. For instance, &lsquo;-ip0&acute;
would format the above as:</p>

<p>if ((((i &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; k &gt; 0) || p == 0)
&amp;&amp; q == 1) || n = 0)</p>

<p>indent assumes that tabs are placed at regular intervals
of both input and output character streams. These intervals
are by default 8 columns wide, but (as of version 1.2) may
be changed by the &lsquo;-ts&acute; option. Tabs are treated
as the equivalent number of spaces.</p>

<p>The indentation of type declarations in old-style
function definitions is controlled by the &lsquo;-ip&acute;
parameter. This is a numeric parameter specifying how many
spaces to indent type declarations. For example, the default
&lsquo;-ip5&acute; makes definitions look like this:</p>

<p>char * create_world (x, y, scale) int x; int y; float
scale; { . . . }</p>

<p>For compatibility with other versions of indent, the
option &lsquo;-nip&acute; is provided, which is equivalent
to &lsquo;-ip0&acute;.</p>

<p>ANSI C allows white space to be placed on preprocessor
command lines between the character &lsquo;#&acute; and the
command name. By default, indent removes this space, but
specifying the &lsquo;-lps&acute; option directs indent to
leave this space unmodified. The option &lsquo;-ppi&acute;
overrides &lsquo;-nlps&acute; and &lsquo;-lps&acute;.</p>

<p>This option can be used to request that preprocessor
conditional state- ments can be indented by to given number
of spaces, for example with the option &lsquo;-ppi
3&acute;</p>

<p>#if X #if Y #define Z 1 #else #define Z 0 #endif #endif
becomes #if X # if Y # define Z 1 # else # define Z 0 #
endif #endif</p>

<p>This option sets the offset at which a label (except
case labels) will be positioned. If it is set to zero or a
positive number, this indi- cates how far from the left
margin to indent a label. If it is set to a negative number,
this indicates how far back from the current indent level to
place the label. The default setting is -2 which matches the
behaviour of earlier versions of indent. Note that this
parameter does not affect the placing of case labels; see
the &lsquo;-cli&acute; parameter for that. For example with
the option &lsquo;-il 1&acute;</p>

<p>group function() { if (do_stuff1() == ERROR) goto
cleanup1;</p>

<p>if (do_stuff2() == ERROR) goto cleanup2;</p>

<p>return SUCCESS;</p>

<p>cleanup2: do_cleanup2();</p>

<p>cleanup1: do_cleanup1();</p>

<p>return ERROR; } becomes group function() { if
(do_stuff1() == ERROR) goto cleanup1;</p>

<p>if (do_stuff2() == ERROR) goto cleanup2;</p>

<p>return SUCCESS;</p>

<p>cleanup2: do_cleanup2();</p>

<p>cleanup1: do_cleanup1();</p>

<p>return ERROR; }</p>

<p>BREAKING LONG LINES With the option &lsquo;-ln&acute;,
or &lsquo;--line-lengthn&acute;, it is possible to specify
the maximum length of a line of C code, not including
possible comments that follow it.</p>

<p>When lines become longer than the specified line length,
GNU indent tries to break the line at a logical place. This
is new as of version 2.1 however and not very intelligent or
flexible yet.</p>

<p>Currently there are two options that allow one to
interfere with the algorithm that determines where to break
a line.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-bbo&acute; option causes GNU indent to
prefer to break long lines before the boolean operators
&amp;&amp; and ||. The &lsquo;-nbbo&acute; option causes GNU
indent not have that preference. For example, the default
option &lsquo;-bbo&acute; (together with
&lsquo;--line-length60&acute; and
&lsquo;--ignore-newlines&acute;) makes code look like
this:</p>

<p>if (mask &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &acute; &acute;) ||
(mask[1] == &acute; &acute; &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] ==
&acute;0&acute;) || (mask[0] == &acute;*&acute;)))))</p>

<p>Using the option &lsquo;-nbbo&acute; will make it look
like this:</p>

<p>if (mask &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &acute; &acute;) ||
(mask[1] == &acute; &acute; &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] ==
&acute;0&acute;) || (mask[0] == &acute;*&acute;)))))</p>

<p>The default &lsquo;-hnl&acute;, however, honours
newlines in the input file by giv- ing them the highest
possible priority to break lines at. For example, when the
input file looks like this:</p>

<p>if (mask &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &acute; &acute;) ||
(mask[1] == &acute; &acute; &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] ==
&acute;0&acute;) || (mask[0] == &acute;*&acute;)))))</p>

<p>then using the option &lsquo;-hnl&acute;, or
&lsquo;--honour-newlines&acute;, together with the
previously mentioned &lsquo;-nbbo&acute; and
&lsquo;--line-length60&acute;, will cause the out- put not
to be what is given in the last example but instead will
prefer to break at the positions where the code was broken
in the input file:</p>

<p>if (mask &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] == &acute; &acute;) ||
(mask[1] == &acute; &acute; &amp;&amp; ((mask[0] ==
&acute;0&acute;) || (mask[0] == &acute;*&acute;)))))</p>

<p>The idea behind this option is that lines which are too
long, but are already broken up, will not be touched by GNU
indent. Really messy code should be run through indent at
least once using the &lsquo;--ignore- newlines&acute; option
though.</p>

<p>DISABLING FORMATTING Formatting of C code may be
disabled for portions of a program by embedding special
control comments in the program. To turn off format- ting
for a section of a program, place the disabling control
comment /* *INDENT-OFF* */ on a line by itself just before
that section. Program text scanned after this control
comment is output precisely as input with no modifications
until the corresponding enabling comment is scanned on a
line by itself. The disabling control comment is /*
*INDENT-ON* */, and any text following the comment on the
line is also output unformatted. Formatting begins again
with the input line fol- lowing the enabling control
comment.</p>

<p>More precisely, indent does not attempt to verify the
closing delimiter (*/) for these C comments, and any
whitespace on the line is totally transparent.</p>

<p>These control comments also function in their C++
formats, namely // *INDENT-OFF* and // *INDENT-ON*.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the internal state of indent
remains unchanged over the course of the unformatted
section. Thus, for example, turning off formatting in the
middle of a function and continuing it after the end of the
function may lead to bizarre results. It is therefore wise
to be somewhat modular in selecting code to be left
unformatted.</p>

<p>As a historical note, some earlier versions of indent
produced error messages beginning with *INDENT**. These
versions of indent were writ- ten to ignore any input text
lines which began with such error mes- sages. I have removed
this incestuous feature from GNU indent.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS To find out what version of indent
you have, use the command indent -version. This will report
the version number of indent, without doing any of the
normal processing.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-v&acute; option can be used to turn on
verbose mode. When in verbose mode, indent reports when it
splits one line of input into two more more lines of output,
and gives some size statistics at completion.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;-pmt&acute; option causes indent to preserve
the access and modification times on the output files. Using
this option has the advantage that running indent on all
source and header files in a project won&acute;t cause make
to rebuild all targets. This option is only available on
Operat- ing Systems that have the POSIX utime(2)
function.</p>

<p>BUGS Please report any bugs to bug-indent@gnu.org.</p>

<p>When indent is run twice on a file, with the same
profile, it should never change that file the second time.
With the current design of indent, this can not be
guaranteed, and it has not been extensively tested.</p>

<p>indent does not understand C. In some cases this leads
to the inability to join lines. The result is that running a
file through indent is irreversible, even if the used input
file was the result of running indent with a given profile
(&lsquo;.indent.pro&acute;).</p>

<p>While an attempt was made to get indent working for C++,
it will not do a good job on any C++ source except the very
simplest.</p>

<p>indent does not look at the given
&lsquo;--line-length&acute; option when writing comments to
the output file. This results often in comments being put
far to the right. In order to prohibit indent from joining a
broken line that has a comment at the end, make sure that
the comments start on the first line of the break.</p>

<p>indent does not count lines and comments (see the
&lsquo;-v&acute; option) when indent is turned off with /*
*INDENT-OFF* */.</p>

<p>Comments of the form /*UPPERCASE*/ are not treated as
comment but as an identifier, causing them to be joined with
the next line. This renders comments of this type useless,
unless they are embedded in the code to begin with.</p>
