<p>SETGID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETGID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setgid - set group identity</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setgid(gid_t gid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setgid() sets the effective group ID of the
calling process. If the caller is the superuser, the real
GID and saved set-group-ID are also set.</p>

<p>Under Linux, setgid() is implemented like the POSIX
version with the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS feature. This allows a
set-group-ID program that is not set-user-ID-root to drop
all of its group privileges, do some un- privileged work,
and then re-engage the original effective group ID in a
secure manner.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM The calling process is not privileged (does
not have the CAP_SETGID capability), and gid does not match
the effective group ID or saved set-group-ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
