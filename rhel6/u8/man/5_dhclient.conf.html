<p>NAME dhclient.conf - DHCP client configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The dhclient.conf file contains
configuration information for dhclient, the Internet Systems
Consortium DHCP Client.</p>

<p>The dhclient.conf file is a free-form ASCII text file.
It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into
dhclient. The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for
formatting purposes. Keywords in the file are
case-insensitive. Comments may be placed anywhere within the
file (except within quotes). Comments begin with the #
character and end at the end of the line.</p>

<p>The dhclient.conf file can be used to configure the
behaviour of the client in a wide variety of ways: protocol
timing, information requested from the server, information
required of the server, defaults to use if the server does
not provide certain information, values with which to
override information provided by the server, or values to
prepend or append to information provided by the server. The
configu- ration file can also be preinitialized with
addresses to use on net- works that dont have DHCP
servers.</p>

<p>PROTOCOL TIMING The timing behaviour of the client need
not be configured by the user. If no timing configuration is
provided by the user, a fairly reasonable timing behaviour
will be used by default - one which results in fairly timely
updates without placing an inordinate load on the
server.</p>

<p>The following statements can be used to adjust the
timing behaviour of the DHCP client if required,
however:</p>

<p>The timeout statement</p>

<p>timeout time ;</p>

<p>The timeout statement determines the amount of time that
must pass between the time that the client begins to try to
determine its address and the time that it decides that its
not going to be able to contact a server. By default, this
timeout is sixty seconds. After the timeout has passed, if
there are any static leases defined in the con- figuration
file, or any leases remaining in the lease database that
have not yet expired, the client will loop through these
leases attempting to validate them, and if it finds one that
appears to be valid, it will use that leases address. If
there are no valid static leases or unexpired leases in the
lease database, the client will restart the protocol after
the defined retry interval.</p>

<p>The retry statement</p>

<p>retry time;</p>

<p>The retry statement determines the time that must pass
after the client has determined that there is no DHCP server
present before it tries again to contact a DHCP server. By
default, this is five minutes.</p>

<p>The select-timeout statement</p>

<p>select-timeout time;</p>

<p>It is possible (some might say desirable) for there to
be more than one DHCP server serving any given network. In
this case, it is possible that a client may be sent more
than one offer in response to its ini- tial lease discovery
message. It may be that one of these offers is preferable to
the other (e.g., one offer may have the address the client
previously used, and the other may not).</p>

<p>The select-timeout is the time after the client sends
its first lease discovery request at which it stops waiting
for offers from servers, assuming that it has received at
least one such offer. If no offers have been received by the
time the select-timeout has expired, the client will accept
the first offer that arrives.</p>

<p>By default, the select-timeout is zero seconds - that
is, the client will take the first offer it sees.</p>

<p>The reboot statement</p>

<p>reboot time;</p>

<p>When the client is restarted, it first tries to
reacquire the last address it had. This is called the
INIT-REBOOT state. If it is still attached to the same
network it was attached to when it last ran, this is the
quickest way to get started. The reboot statement sets the
time that must elapse after the client first tries to
reacquire its old address before it gives up and tries to
discover a new address. By default, the reboot timeout is
ten seconds.</p>

<p>The backoff-cutoff statement</p>

<p>backoff-cutoff time;</p>

<p>The client uses an exponential backoff algorithm with
some randomness, so that if many clients try to configure
themselves at the same time, they will not make their
requests in lockstep. The backoff-cutoff statement
determines the maximum amount of time that the client is
allowed to back off, the actual value will be evaluated
randomly between 1/2 to 1 1/2 times the time specified. It
defaults to two minutes.</p>

<p>The initial-interval statement</p>

<p>initial-interval time;</p>

<p>The initial-interval statement sets the amount of time
between the first attempt to reach a server and the second
attempt to reach a server. Each time a message is sent, the
interval between messages is incremented by twice the
current interval multiplied by a random number between zero
and one. If it is greater than the backoff-cutoff amount, it
is set to that amount. It defaults to ten seconds.</p>

<p>LEASE REQUIREMENTS AND REQUESTS The DHCP protocol allows
the client to request that the server send it specific
information, and not send it other information that it is
not prepared to accept. The protocol also allows the client
to reject offers from servers if they dont contain
information the client needs, or if the information provided
is not satisfactory.</p>

<p>There is a variety of data contained in offers that DHCP
servers send to DHCP clients. The data that can be
specifically requested is what are called DHCP Options. DHCP
Options are defined in dhcp-options(5).</p>

<p>The request statement</p>

<p>[ also ] request [ [ option-space . ] option ] [, ...
];</p>

<p>The request statement causes the client to request that
any server responding to the client send the client its
values for the specified options. Only the option names
should be specified in the request statement - not option
parameters. By default, the DHCPv4 client requests the
subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
domain-name, domain-search, domain-name-servers, host-name,
nis-domain, nis-servers, ntp-servers and interface-mtu
options. The DHCPv6 client requests by default name-servers
and domain-search. Note that if you enter a request
statement, you over-ride this default and these options will
not be requested.</p>

<p>In some cases, it may be desirable to send no parameter
request list at all. To do this, simply write the request
statement but specify no parameters:</p>

<p>request;</p>

<p>In most cases, it is desirable to simply add one option
to the request list which is of interest to the client in
question. In this case, it is best to also request the
additional options:</p>

<p>also request domain-search,
dhcp6.sip-servers-addresses;</p>

<p>The require statement</p>

<p>[ also ] require [ [ option-space . ] option ] [, ...
];</p>

<p>The require statement lists options that must be sent in
order for an offer to be accepted. Offers that do not
contain all the listed options will be ignored. There is no
default require list.</p>

<p>require name-servers;</p>

<p>interface eth0 { also require domain-search; }</p>

<p>The send statement</p>

<p>send { [ option declaration ] [, ... option declaration
]}</p>

<p>The send statement causes the client to send the
specified options to the server with the specified values.
These are full option declarations as described in
dhcp-options(5). Options that are always sent in the DHCP
protocol should not be specified here, except that the
client can specify a requested dhcp-lease-time option other
than the default requested lease time, which is two hours.
The other obvious use for this statement is to send
information to the server that will allow it to
differentiate between this client and other clients or kinds
of clients.</p>

<p>DYNAMIC DNS The client now has some very limited support
for doing DNS updates when a lease is acquired. This is
prototypical, and probably doesnt do what you want. It also
only works if you happen to have control over your DNS
server, which isnt very likely.</p>

<p>Note that everything in this section is true whether you
are using DHCPv4 or DHCPv6. The exact same syntax is used
for both.</p>

<p>To make it work, you have to declare a key and zone as
in the DHCP server (see dhcpd.conf(5) for details). You also
need to configure the fqdn option on the client, as
follows:</p>

<p>send fqdn.fqdn &quot;grosse.fugue.com.&quot;; send
fqdn.encoded on; send fqdn.server-update off; also request
fqdn, dhcp6.fqdn;</p>

<p>The fqdn.fqdn option MUST be a fully-qualified domain
name. You MUST define a zone statement for the zone to be
updated. The fqdn.encoded option may need to be set to on or
off, depending on the DHCP server you are using.</p>

<p>The do-forward-updates statement</p>

<p>do-forward-updates [ flag ] ;</p>

<p>If you want to do DNS updates in the DHCP client script
(see dhclient- script(8)) rather than having the DHCP client
do the update directly (for example, if you want to use
SIG(0) authentication, which is not supported directly by
the DHCP client, you can instruct the client not to do the
update using the do-forward-updates statement. Flag should
be true if you want the DHCP client to do the update, and
false if you don t want the DHCP client to do the update. By
default, the DHCP client will do the DNS update.</p>

<p>OPTION MODIFIERS In some cases, a client may receive
option data from the server which is not really appropriate
for that client, or may not receive informa- tion that it
needs, and for which a useful default value exists. It may
also receive information which is useful, but which needs to
be supplemented with local information. To handle these
needs, several option modifiers are available.</p>

<p>The default statement</p>

<p>default [ option declaration ] ;</p>

<p>If for some option the client should use the value
supplied by the server, but needs to use some default value
if no value was supplied by the server, these values can be
defined in the default statement.</p>

<p>The supersede statement</p>

<p>supersede [ option declaration ] ;</p>

<p>If for some option the client should always use a
locally-configured value or values rather than whatever is
supplied by the server, these values can be defined in the
supersede statement.</p>

<p>The prepend statement</p>

<p>prepend [ option declaration ] ;</p>

<p>If for some set of options the client should use a value
you supply, and then use the values supplied by the server,
if any, these values can be defined in the prepend
statement. The prepend statement can only be used for
options which allow more than one value to be given. This
restriction is not enforced - if you ignore it, the
behaviour will be unpredictable.</p>

<p>The append statement</p>

<p>append [ option declaration ] ;</p>

<p>If for some set of options the client should first use
the values sup- plied by the server, if any, and then use
values you supply, these val- ues can be defined in the
append statement. The append statement can only be used for
options which allow more than one value to be given. This
restriction is not enforced - if you ignore it, the
behaviour will be unpredictable.</p>

<p>LEASE DECLARATIONS The lease declaration</p>

<p>lease { lease-declaration [ ... lease-declaration ]
}</p>

<p>The DHCP client may decide after some period of time
(see PROTOCOL TIM- ING) that it is not going to succeed in
contacting a server. At that time, it consults its own
database of old leases and tests each one that has not yet
timed out by pinging the listed router for that lease to see
if that lease could work. It is possible to define one or
more fixed leases in the client configuration file for
networks where there is no DHCP or BOOTP service, so that
the client can still automatically configure its address.
This is done with the lease statement.</p>

<p>NOTE: the lease statement is also used in the
dhclient.leases file in order to record leases that have
been received from DHCP servers. Some of the syntax for
leases as described below is only needed in the
dhclient.leases file. Such syntax is documented here for
complete- ness.</p>

<p>A lease statement consists of the lease keyword,
followed by a left curly brace, followed by one or more
lease declaration statements, fol- lowed by a right curly
brace. The following lease declarations are possible:</p>

<p>bootp;</p>

<p>The bootp statement is used to indicate that the lease
was acquired using the BOOTP protocol rather than the DHCP
protocol. It is never necessary to specify this in the
client configuration file. The client uses this syntax in
its lease database file.</p>

<p>interface &quot;string&quot;;</p>

<p>The interface lease statement is used to indicate the
interface on which the lease is valid. If set, this lease
will only be tried on a particular interface. When the
client receives a lease from a server, it always records the
interface number on which it received that lease. If
predefined leases are specified in the dhclient.conf file,
the interface should also be specified, although this is not
required.</p>

<p>fixed-address ip-address;</p>

<p>The fixed-address statement is used to set the ip
address of a particu- lar lease. This is required for all
lease statements. The IP address must be specified as a
dotted quad (e.g., 12.34.56.78).</p>

<p>filename &quot;string&quot;;</p>

<p>The filename statement specifies the name of the boot
filename to use. This is not used by the standard client
configuration script, but is included for completeness.</p>

<p>server-name &quot;string&quot;;</p>

<p>The server-name statement specifies the name of the boot
server name to use. This is also not used by the standard
client configuration script.</p>

<p>option option-declaration;</p>

<p>The option statement is used to specify the value of an
option supplied by the server, or, in the case of predefined
leases declared in dhclient.conf, the value that the user
wishes the client configuration script to use if the
predefined lease is used.</p>

<p>script &quot;script-name&quot;;</p>

<p>The script statement is used to specify the pathname of
the dhcp client configuration script. This script is used by
the dhcp client to set each interfaces initial configuration
prior to requesting an address, to test the address once it
has been offered, and to set the inter- face s final
configuration once a lease has been acquired. If no lease is
acquired, the script is used to test predefined leases, if
any, and also called once if no valid lease can be
identified. For more information, see
dhclient-script(8).</p>

<p>vendor option space &quot;name&quot;;</p>

<p>The vendor option space statement is used to specify
which option space should be used for decoding the
vendor-encapsulate-options option if one is received. The
dhcp-vendor-identifier can be used to request a specific
class of vendor options from the server. See dhcp-options(5)
for details.</p>

<p>medium &quot;media setup&quot;;</p>

<p>The medium statement can be used on systems where
network interfaces cannot automatically determine the type
of network to which they are connected. The media setup
string is a system-dependent parameter which is passed to
the dhcp client configuration script when initializ- ing the
interface. On Unix and Unix-like systems, the argument is
passed on the ifconfig command line when configuring the
interface.</p>

<p>The dhcp client automatically declares this parameter if
it uses a media type (see the media statement) when
configuring the interface in order to obtain a lease. This
statement should be used in predefined leases only if the
network interface requires media type configuration.</p>

<p>renew date;</p>

<p>rebind date;</p>

<p>expire date;</p>

<p>The renew statement defines the time at which the dhcp
client should begin trying to contact its server to renew a
lease that it is using. The rebind statement defines the
time at which the dhcp client should begin to try to contact
any dhcp server in order to renew its lease. The expire
statement defines the time at which the dhcp client must
stop using a lease if it has not been able to contact a
server in order to renew it.</p>

<p>These declarations are automatically set in leases
acquired by the DHCP client, but must also be configured in
predefined leases - a predefined lease whose expiry time has
passed will not be used by the DHCP client.</p>

<p>Dates are specified in one of two ways. The software
will output times in these two formats depending on if the
db-time-format configuration parameter has been set to
default or local.</p>

<p>If it is set to default, then date values appear as
follows:</p>

<p>&lt;weekday&gt; &lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt;
&lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt;</p>

<p>The weekday is present to make it easy for a human to
tell when a lease expires - its specified as a number from
zero to six, with zero being Sunday. When declaring a
predefined lease, it can always be specified as zero. The
year is specified with the century, so it should generally
be four digits except for really long leases. The month is
specified as a number starting with 1 for January. The day
of the month is likewise specified starting with 1. The hour
is a number between 0 and 23, the minute a number between 0
and 59, and the second also a number between 0 and 59.</p>

<p>If the db-time-format configuration was set to local,
then the date values appear as follows:</p>

<p>epoch &lt;seconds-since-epoch&gt;; # &lt;day-name&gt;
&lt;month-name&gt; &lt;day-number&gt;
&lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt;:&lt;seconds&gt;
&lt;year&gt;</p>

<p>The seconds-since-epoch is as according to the systems
local clock (often referred to as &quot;unix time&quot;).
The # symbol supplies a comment that describes what actual
time this is as according to the systems configured
timezone, at the time the value was written. It is provided
only for human inspection, the epoch time is the only
recommended value for machine inspection.</p>

<p>Note that when defining a static lease, one may use
either time format one wishes, and need not include the
comment or values after it.</p>

<p>If the time is infinite in duration, then the date is
never instead of an actual date.</p>

<p>ALIAS DECLARATIONS alias { declarations ... }</p>

<p>Some DHCP clients running TCP/IP roaming protocols may
require that in addition to the lease they may acquire via
DHCP, their interface also be configured with a predefined
IP alias so that they can have a perma- nent IP address even
while roaming. The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client
doesn t support roaming with fixed addresses directly, but
in order to facilitate such experimentation, the dhcp client
can be set up to configure an IP alias using the alias
declaration.</p>

<p>The alias declaration resembles a lease declaration,
except that options other than the subnet-mask option are
ignored by the standard client configuration script, and
expiry times are ignored. A typical alias declaration
includes an interface declaration, a fixed-address
declaration for the IP alias address, and a subnet-mask
option declara- tion. A medium statement should never be
included in an alias decla- ration.</p>

<p>OTHER DECLARATIONS db-time-format [ default | local ]
;</p>

<p>The db-time-format option determines which of two output
methods are used for printing times in leases files. The
default format provides day-and-time in UTC, whereas local
uses a seconds-since-epoch to store the time value, and
helpfully places a local timezone time in a comment on the
same line. The formats are described in detail in this
manpage, whithin the LEASE DECLARATIONS section.</p>

<p>reject cidr-ip-address [, ... cidr-ip-address ] ;</p>

<p>The reject statement causes the DHCP client to reject
offers from servers whose server identifier matches any of
the specified hosts or subnets. This can be used to avoid
being configured by rogue or mis- configured dhcp servers,
although it should be a last resort - better to track down
the bad DHCP server and fix it.</p>

<p>The cidr-ip-address configuration type is of the form
ip-address[/pre- fixlen], where ip-address is a dotted quad
IP address, and prefixlen is the CIDR prefix length of the
subnet, counting the number of signifi- cant bits in the
netmask starting from the leftmost end. Example
configuration syntax:</p>

<p>reject 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.5;</p>

<p>The above example would cause offers from any server
identifier in the entire RFC 1918 &quot;Class C&quot;
network 192.168.0.0/16, or the specific single address
10.0.0.5, to be rejected.</p>

<p>interface &quot;name&quot; { declarations ... }</p>

<p>A client with more than one network interface may
require different behaviour depending on which interface is
being configured. All timing parameters and declarations
other than lease and alias declarations can be enclosed in
an interface declaration, and those parameters will then be
used only for the interface that matches the specified name.
Interfaces for which there is no interface declaration will
use the parameters declared outside of any inter- face
declaration, or the default settings.</p>

<p>Note well: ISC dhclient only maintains one list of
interfaces, which is either determined at startup from
command line arguments, or otherwise is autode- tected. If
you supplied the list of interfaces on the command line,
this con- figuration clause will add the named interface to
the list in such a way that will cause it to be configured
by DHCP. Which may not be the result you had intended. This
is an undesirable side effect that will be addressed in a
future release.</p>

<p>pseudo &quot;name&quot; &quot;real-name&quot; {
declarations ... }</p>

<p>Under some circumstances it can be useful to declare a
pseudo-interface and have the DHCP client acquire a
configuration for that interface. Each inter- face that the
DHCP client is supporting normally has a DHCP client state
machine running on it to acquire and maintain its lease. A
pseudo-interface is just another state machine running on
the interface named real-name, with its own lease and its
own state. If you use this feature, you must provide a
client identifier for both the pseudo-interface and the
actual interface, and the two identifiers must be different.
You must also provide a separate client script for the
pseudo-interface to do what you want with the IP address.
For example:</p>

<p>interface &quot;ep0&quot; { send dhcp-client-identifier
&quot;my-client-ep0&quot;; } pseudo &quot;secondary&quot;
&quot;ep0&quot; { send dhcp-client-identifier
&quot;my-client-ep0-secondary&quot;; script
&quot;/etc/dhclient-secondary&quot;; }</p>

<p>The client script for the pseudo-interface should not
configure the interface up or down - essentially, all it
needs to handle are the states where a lease has been
acquired or renewed, and the states where a lease has
expired. See dhclient-script(8) for more information.</p>

<p>media &quot;media setup&quot; [ , &quot;media
setup&quot;, ... ];</p>

<p>The media statement defines one or more media
configuration parameters which may be tried while attempting
to acquire an IP address. The dhcp client will cycle through
each media setup string on the list, configuring the
interface using that setup and attempting to boot, and then
trying the next one. This can be used for network interfaces
which arent capable of sensing the media type unaided -
whichever media type succeeds in getting a request to the
server and hearing the reply is probably right (no
guarantees).</p>

<p>The media setup is only used for the initial phase of
address acquisition (the DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPOFFER
packets). Once an address has been acquired, the dhcp client
will record it in its lease database and will record the
media type used to acquire the address. Whenever the client
tries to renew the lease, it will use that same media type.
The lease must expire before the client will go back to
cycling through media types.</p>

<p>bootp-broadcast-always;</p>

<p>The bootp-broadcast-always statement instructs dhclient
to always set the bootp broadcast flag in request packets,
so that servers will always broadcast replies. This is
equivalent to supplying the dhclient -B argument, and has
the same effect as specifying always-broadcast in the
servers dhcpd.conf. This option is provided as an extension
to enable dhclient to work on IBM s390 Linux guests.</p>

<p>SAMPLE The following configuration file is used on a
laptop running NetBSD 1.3. The laptop has an IP alias of
192.5.5.213, and has one inter- face, ep0 (a 3com 3C589C).
Booting intervals have been shortened somewhat from the
default, because the client is known to spend most of its
time on networks with little DHCP activity. The laptop does
roam to multiple networks.</p>

<p>timeout 60; retry 60; reboot 10; select-timeout 5;
initial-interval 2; reject 192.33.137.209;</p>

<p>interface &quot;ep0&quot; { send host-name
&quot;andare.fugue.com&quot;; send dhcp-client-identifier
1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c; send dhcp-lease-time 3600; supersede
domain-search &quot;fugue.com&quot;, &quot;rc.vix.com&quot;,
&quot;home.vix.com&quot;; prepend domain-name-servers
127.0.0.1; request subnet-mask, broadcast-address,
time-offset, routers, domain-search, domain-name,
domain-name-servers, host-name; require subnet-mask,
domain-name-servers; script
&quot;/sbin/dhclient-script&quot;; media &quot;media
10baseT/UTP&quot;, &quot;media 10base2/BNC&quot;; }</p>

<p>alias { interface &quot;ep0&quot;; fixed-address
192.5.5.213; option subnet-mask 255.255.255.255; } This is a
very complicated dhclient.conf file - in general, yours
should be much simpler. In many cases, its sufficient to
just create an empty dhclient.conf file - the defaults are
usually fine.</p>
