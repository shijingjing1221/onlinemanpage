<p>XCreateColormap(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XCreateColormap(3)</p>

<p>NAME XCreateColormap, XCopyColormapAndFree,
XFreeColormap, XColor - create, copy, or destroy colormaps
and color structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX Colormap XCreateColormap(Display *display, Window
w, Visual *visual, int alloc);</p>

<p>Colormap XCopyColormapAndFree(Display *display, Colormap
colormap);</p>

<p>int XFreeColormap(Display *display, Colormap
colormap);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS alloc Specifies the colormap entries to be
allocated. You can pass AllocNone or AllocAll.</p>

<p>colormap Specifies the colormap that you want to create,
copy, set, or destroy.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>visual Specifies a visual type supported on the screen.
If the visual type is not one supported by the screen, a
BadMatch error results.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window on whose screen you want to
create a colormap.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XCreateColormap function creates a
colormap of the specified visual type for the screen on
which the specified window resides and returns the colormap
ID associated with it. Note that the specified window is
only used to determine the screen.</p>

<p>The initial values of the colormap entries are undefined
for the visual classes GrayScale, PseudoColor, and
DirectColor. For StaticGray, Stat- icColor, and TrueColor,
the entries have defined values, but those val- ues are
specific to the visual and are not defined by X. For Stat-
icGray, StaticColor, and TrueColor, alloc must be AllocNone,
or a Bad- Match error results. For the other visual classes,
if alloc is Alloc- None, the colormap initially has no
allocated entries, and clients can allocate them. For
information about the visual types, see section 3.1.</p>

<p>If alloc is AllocAll, the entire colormap is allocated
writable. The initial values of all allocated entries are
undefined. For GrayScale and PseudoColor, the effect is as
if an XAllocColorCells call returned all pixel values from
zero to N - 1, where N is the colormap entries value in the
specified visual. For DirectColor, the effect is as if an
XAllocColorPlanes call returned a pixel value of zero and
red_mask, green_mask, and blue_mask values containing the
same bits as the corre- sponding masks in the specified
visual. However, in all cases, none of these entries can be
freed by using XFreeColors.</p>

<p>XCreateColormap can generate BadAlloc, BadMatch,
BadValue, and BadWin- dow errors.</p>

<p>The XCopyColormapAndFree function creates a colormap of
the same visual type and for the same screen as the
specified colormap and returns the new colormap ID. It also
moves all of the client s existing allocation from the
specified colormap to the new colormap with their color
values intact and their read-only or writable
characteristics intact and frees those entries in the
specified colormap. Color values in other entries in the new
colormap are undefined. If the specified colormap was cre-
ated by the client with alloc set to AllocAll, the new
colormap is also created with AllocAll, all color values for
all entries are copied from the specified colormap, and then
all entries in the specified colormap are freed. If the
specified colormap was not created by the client with
AllocAll, the allocations to be moved are all those pixels
and planes that have been allocated by the client using
XAllocColor, XAl- locNamedColor, XAllocColorCells, or
XAllocColorPlanes and that have not been freed since they
were allocated.</p>

<p>XCopyColormapAndFree can generate BadAlloc and BadColor
errors.</p>

<p>The XFreeColormap function deletes the association
between the colormap resource ID and the colormap and frees
the colormap storage. However, this function has no effect
on the default colormap for a screen. If the specified
colormap is an installed map for a screen, it is unin-
stalled (see XUninstallColormap). If the specified colormap
is defined as the colormap for a window (by XCreateWindow,
XSetWindowColormap, or XChangeWindowAttributes),
XFreeColormap changes the colormap associated with the
window to None and generates a ColormapNotify event. X does
not define the colors displayed for a window with a colormap
of None.</p>

<p>XFreeColormap can generate a BadColor error.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XColor structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned long pixel; /* pixel value */
unsigned short red, green, blue; /* rgb values */ char
flags; /* DoRed, DoGreen, DoBlue */ char pad; } XColor;</p>

<p>The red, green, and blue values are always in the range
0 to 65535 inclusive, independent of the number of bits
actually used in the dis- play hardware. The server scales
these values down to the range used by the hardware. Black
is represented by (0,0,0), and white is repre- sented by
(65535,65535,65535). In some functions, the flags member
controls which of the red, green, and blue members is used
and can be the inclusive OR of zero or more of DoRed,
DoGreen, and DoBlue.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadColor A value for a Colormap argument does not name a
defined Col- ormap.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
