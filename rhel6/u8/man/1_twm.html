<p>NAME twm - Tab Window Manager for the X Window
System</p>

<p>SYNTAX twm [ -display dpy ] [ -s ] [ -f initfile ] [ -v
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Twm is a window manager for the X Window
System. It provides title- bars, shaped windows, several
forms of icon management, user-defined macro functions,
click-to-type and pointer-driven keyboard focus, and
user-specified key and pointer button bindings.</p>

<p>This program is usually started by the users session
manager or startup script. When used from xdm(1) or xinit(1)
without a session manager, twm is frequently executed in the
foreground as the last client. When run this way, exiting
twm causes the session to be termi- nated (i.e., logged
out).</p>

<p>By default, application windows are surrounded by a
frame with a titlebar at the top and a special border around
the window. The title- bar contains the window s name, a
rectangle that is lit when the window is receiving keyboard
input, and function boxes known as titlebut- tons at the
left and right edges of the titlebar.</p>

<p>Pressing pointer Button1 (usually the left-most button
unless it has been changed with xmodmap) on a titlebutton
will invoke the function associated with the button. In the
default interface, windows are iconified by clicking
(pressing and then immediately releasing) the left
titlebutton (which looks like a Dot). Conversely, windows
are deiconified by clicking in the associated icon or entry
in the icon manager (see description of the variable
ShowIconManager and of the function f.showiconmgr).</p>

<p>Windows are resized by pressing the right titlebutton
(which resembles a group of nested squares), dragging the
pointer over edge that is to be moved, and releasing the
pointer when the outline of the window is the desired size.
Similarly, windows are moved by pressing in the title or
highlight region, dragging a window outline to the new loca-
tion, and then releasing when the outline is in the desired
position. Just clicking in the title or highlight region
raises the window with- out moving it.</p>

<p>When new windows are created, twm will honor any size
and location information requested by the user (usually
through -geometry command line argument or resources for the
individual applications). Other- wise, an outline of the
window s default size, its titlebar, and lines dividing the
window into a 3x3 grid that track the pointer are dis-
played. Clicking pointer Button1 will position the window at
the cur- rent position and give it the default size.
Pressing pointer Button2 (usually the middle pointer button)
and dragging the outline will give the window its current
position but allow the sides to be resized as described
above. Clicking pointer Button3 (usually the right pointer
button) will give the window its current position but
attempt to make it long enough to touch the bottom the
screen.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Twm accepts the following command line
options:</p>

<p>-display dpy This option specifies the X server to
use.</p>

<p>-s This option indicates that only the default screen
(as speci- fied by -display or by the DISPLAY environment
variable) should be managed. By default, twm will attempt to
manage all screens on the display.</p>

<p>-f filename This option specifies the name of the
startup file to use. By default, twm will look in the user s
home directory for files named .twmrc.num (where num is a
screen number) or .twmrc.</p>

<p>-v This option indicates that twm should print error
messages whenever an unexpected X Error event is received.
This can be useful when debugging applications but can be
distracting in regular use.</p>

<p>CUSTOMIZATION Much of twms appearance and behavior can
be controlled by providing a startup file in one of the
following locations (searched in order for each screen being
managed when twm begins):</p>

<p>$HOME/.twmrc.screennumber The screennumber is a small
positive number (e.g. 0, 1, etc.) representing the screen
number (e.g. the last number in the DISPLAY environment
variable host:displaynum.screennum) that would be used to
contact that screen of the display. This is intended for
displays with multiple screens of differing visual
types.</p>

<p>$HOME/.twmrc This is the usual name for an individual
user s startup file.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/X11/twm/system.twmrc If neither of the
preceding files are found, twm will look in this file for a
default configuration. This is often tailored by the site
administrator to provide convenient menus or famil- iar
bindings for novice users.</p>

<p>If no startup files are found, twm will use the built-in
defaults described above. The only resource used by twm is
bitmapFilePath for a colon-separated list of directories to
search when looking for bitmap files (for more information,
see the Athena Widgets manual and xrdb(1)).</p>

<p>Twm startup files are logically broken up into three
types of specifi- cations: Variables, Bindings, Menus. The
Variables section must come first and is used to describe
the fonts, colors, cursors, border widths, icon and window
placement, highlighting, autoraising, layout of titles,
warping, use of the icon manager. The Bindings section
usually comes second and is used to specify the functions
that should be to be invoked when keyboard and pointer
buttons are pressed in windows, icons, titles, and frames.
The Menus section gives any user-defined menus (containing
functions to be invoked or commands to be executed).</p>

<p>Variable names and keywords are case-insensitive.
Strings must be sur- rounded by double quote characters
(e.g. &quot;blue&quot;) and are case-sensi- tive. A pound
sign (#) outside of a string causes the remainder of the
line in which the character appears to be treated as a
comment.</p>

<p>VARIABLES Many of the aspects of twms user interface are
controlled by variables that may be set in the users startup
file. Some of the options are enabled or disabled simply by
the presence of a particular keyword. Other options require
keywords, numbers, strings, or lists of all of these.</p>

<p>Lists are surrounded by braces and are usually separated
by whitespace or a newline. For example:</p>

<p>AutoRaise { &quot;emacs&quot; &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;Xmh&quot; }</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>AutoRaise { &quot;emacs&quot; &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;Xmh&quot; }</p>

<p>When a variable containing a list of strings
representing windows is searched (e.g. to determine whether
or not to enable autoraise as shown above), a string must be
an exact, case-sensitive match to the windows name (given by
the WM_NAME window property), resource name or class name
(both given by the WM_CLASS window property). The preceding
exam- ple would enable autoraise on windows named emacs as
well as any xterm (since they are of class XTerm ) or xmh
windows (which are of class Xmh).</p>

<p>String arguments that are interpreted as filenames (see
the Pixmaps, Cursors, and IconDirectory below) will prepend
the user s directory (specified by the HOME environment
variable) if the first character is a tilde (~). If,
instead, the first character is a colon (:), the name is
assumed to refer to one of the internal bitmaps that are
used to create the default titlebars symbols: :xlogo or
:delete (both refer to the X logo), :dot or :iconify (both
refer to the dot), :resize (the nested squares used by the
resize button), :menu (a page with lines), and :question
(the question mark used for non-existent bitmap files).</p>

<p>The following variables may be specified at the top of a
twm startup file. Lists of Window name prefix strings are
indicated by win-list. Optional arguments are shown in
square brackets:</p>

<p>AutoRaise { win-list } This variable specifies a list of
windows that should automati- cally be raised whenever the
pointer enters the window. This action can be interactively
enabled or disabled on individual windows using the function
f.autoraise.</p>

<p>AutoRelativeResize This variable indicates that dragging
out a window size (either when initially sizing the window
with pointer Button2 or when resizing it) should not wait
until the pointer has crossed the window edges. Instead,
moving the pointer automatically causes the nearest edge or
edges to move by the same amount. This allows the resizing
of windows that extend off the edge of the screen. If the
pointer is in the center of the window, or if the resize is
begun by pressing a titlebutton, twm will still wait for the
pointer to cross a window edge (to prevent acci- dents).
This option is particularly useful for people who like the
press-drag-release method of sweeping out window sizes.</p>

<p>BorderColor string [{ wincolorlist }] This variable
specifies the default color of the border to be placed
around all non-iconified windows, and may only be given
within a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional
wincolorlist specifies a list of window and color name pairs
for specifying particular border colors for different types
of windows. For example:</p>

<p>BorderColor &quot;gray50&quot; { &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;red&quot; &quot;xmh&quot; &quot;green&quot; }</p>

<p>The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>BorderTileBackground string [{ wincolorlist }] This
variable specifies the default background color in the gray
pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if NoHighlight
hasn t been set), and may only be given within a Color,
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional wincolorlist
allows per-window colors to be specified. The default is
&quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p>BorderTileForeground string [{ wincolorlist }] This
variable specifies the default foreground color in the gray
pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if NoHighlight
hasnt been set), and may only be given within a Color,
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional wincolorlist
allows per-window colors to be specified. The default is
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>BorderWidth pixels This variable specifies the width in
pixels of the border sur- rounding all client window frames
if ClientBorderWidth has not been specified. This value is
also used to set the border size of windows created by twm
(such as the icon manager). The default is 2.</p>

<p>ButtonIndent pixels This variable specifies the amount
by which titlebuttons should be indented on all sides.
Positive values cause the buttons to be smaller than the
window text and highlight area so that they stand out.
Setting this and the TitleButtonBorderWidth vari- ables to 0
makes titlebuttons be as tall and wide as possible. The
default is 1.</p>

<p>ClientBorderWidth This variable indicates that border
width of a windows frame should be set to the initial border
width of the window, rather than to the value of
BorderWidth.</p>

<p>Color { colors-list } This variable specifies a list of
color assignments to be made if the default display is
capable of displaying more than sim- ple black and white.
The colors-list is made up of the follow- ing color
variables and their values: DefaultBackground,
DefaultForeground, MenuBackground, MenuForeground,
MenuTitle- Background, MenuTitleForeground, MenuShadowColor,
MenuBorder- Color, PointerForeground, and PointerBackground.
The following color variables may also be given a list of
window and color name pairs to allow per-window colors to be
specified (see Bor- derColor for details): BorderColor,
IconManagerHighlight, Bor- derTitleBackground,
BorderTitleForeground, TitleBackground, TitleForeground,
IconBackground, IconForeground, IconBorder- Color,
IconManagerBackground, and IconManagerForeground. For
example:</p>

<p>Color { MenuBackground &quot;gray50&quot; MenuForeground
&quot;blue&quot; BorderColor &quot;red&quot; {
&quot;XTerm&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; } TitleForeground
&quot;yellow&quot; TitleBackground &quot;blue&quot; }</p>

<p>All of these color variables may also be specified for
the Monochrome variable, allowing the same initialization
file to be used on both color and monochrome displays.</p>

<p>ConstrainedMoveTime milliseconds This variable specifies
the length of time between button clicks needed to begin a
constrained move operation. Double clicking within this
amount of time when invoking f.move will cause the window to
be moved only in a horizontal or vertical direction. Setting
this value to 0 will disable constrained moves. The default
is 400 milliseconds.</p>

<p>Cursors { cursor-list } This variable specifies the
glyphs that twm should use for var- ious pointer cursors.
Each cursor may be defined either from the cursor font or
from two bitmap files. Shapes from the cur- sor font may be
specified directly as:</p>

<p>cursorname &quot;string&quot;</p>

<p>where cursorname is one of the cursor names listed
below, and string is the name of a glyph as found in the
file /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h (without the XC_ prefix).
If the cursor is to be defined from bitmap files, the
following syntax is used instead:</p>

<p>cursorname &quot;image&quot; &quot;mask&quot;</p>

<p>The image and mask strings specify the names of files
contain- ing the glyph image and mask in bitmap(1) form. The
bitmap files are located in the same manner as icon bitmap
files. The following example shows the default cursor
definitions:</p>

<p>Cursors { Frame &quot;top_left_arrow&quot; Title
&quot;top_left_arrow&quot; Icon &quot;top_left_arrow&quot;
IconMgr &quot;top_left_arrow&quot; Move &quot;fleur&quot;
Resize &quot;fleur&quot; Menu &quot;sb_left_arrow&quot;
Button &quot;hand2&quot; Wait &quot;watch&quot; Select
&quot;dot&quot; Destroy &quot;pirate&quot; }</p>

<p>DecorateTransients This variable indicates that
transient windows (those contain- ing a WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
property) should have titlebars. By default, transients are
not reparented.</p>

<p>DefaultBackground string This variable specifies the
background color to be used for sizing and information
windows. The default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p>DefaultForeground string This variable specifies the
foreground color to be used for sizing and information
windows. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>DontIconifyByUnmapping { win-list } This variable
specifies a list of windows that should not be iconified by
simply unmapping the window (as would be the case if
IconifyByUnmapping had been set). This is frequently used to
force some windows to be treated as icons while other win-
dows are handled by the icon manager.</p>

<p>DontMoveOff This variable indicates that windows should
not be allowed to be moved off the screen. It can be
overridden by the f.force- move function.</p>

<p>DontSqueezeTitle [{ win-list }] This variable indicates
that titlebars should not be squeezed to their minimum size
as described under SqueezeTitle below. If the optional
window list is supplied, only those windows will be
prevented from being squeezed.</p>

<p>ForceIcons This variable indicates that icon pixmaps
specified in the Icons variable should override any
client-supplied pixmaps.</p>

<p>FramePadding pixels This variable specifies the distance
between the titlebar deco- rations (the button and text) and
the window frame. The default is 2 pixels.</p>

<p>Grayscale { colors } This variable specifies a list of
color assignments that should be made if the screen has a
GrayScale default visual. See the description of Colors.</p>

<p>IconBackground string [{ win-list }] This variable
specifies the background color of icons, and may only be
specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list.
The optional win-list is a list of window names and col- ors
so that per-window colors may be specified. See the Bor-
derColor variable for a complete description of the
win-list. The default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p>IconBorderColor string [{ win-list }] This variable
specifies the color of the border used for icon windows, and
may only be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or
Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a list of window
names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.
See the BorderColor variable for a complete description of
the win-list. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>IconBorderWidth pixels This variable specifies the width
in pixels of the border sur- rounding icon windows. The
default is 2.</p>

<p>IconDirectory string This variable specifies the
directory that should be searched if if a bitmap file cannot
be found in any of the directories in the bitmapFilePath
resource.</p>

<p>IconFont string This variable specifies the font to be
used to display icon names within icons. The default is
&quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p>IconForeground string [{ win-list }] This variable
specifies the foreground color to be used when displaying
icons, and may only be specified inside of a Color,
Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional win-list is a
list of window names and colors so that per-window colors
may be specified. See the BorderColor variable for a
complete description of the win-list. The default is
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>IconifyByUnmapping [{ win-list }] This variable
indicates that windows should be iconified by being unmapped
without trying to map any icons. This assumes that the user
will remap the window through the icon manager, the f.warpto
function, or the TwmWindows menu. If the optional win-list
is provided, only those windows will be iconified by simply
unmapping. Windows that have both this and the IconMan-
agerDontShow options set may not be accessible if no binding
to the TwmWindows menu is set in the user s startup
file.</p>

<p>IconManagerBackground string [{ win-list }] This
variable specifies the background color to use for icon
manager entries, and may only be specified inside of a
Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The optional win-list
is a list of window names and colors so that per-window
colors may be specified. See the BorderColor variable for a
complete description of the win-list. The default is
&quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p>IconManagerDontShow [{ win-list }] This variable
indicates that the icon manager should not dis- play any
windows. If the optional win-list is given, only those
windows will not be displayed. This variable is used to
prevent windows that are rarely iconified (such as xclock or
xload) from taking up space in the icon manager.</p>

<p>IconManagerFont string This variable specifies the font
to be used when displaying icon manager entries. The default
is &quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p>IconManagerForeground string [{ win-list }] This
variable specifies the foreground color to be used when
displaying icon manager entries, and may only be specified
inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The
optional win-list is a list of window names and colors so
that per-win- dow colors may be specified. See the
BorderColor variable for a complete description of the
win-list. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>IconManagerGeometry string [ columns ] This variable
specifies the geometry of the icon manager win- dow. The
string argument is standard geometry specification that
indicates the initial full size of the icon manager. The
icon manager window is then broken into columns pieces and
scaled according to the number of entries in the icon
manager. Extra entries are wrapped to form additional rows.
The default number of columns is 1.</p>

<p>IconManagerHighlight string [{ win-list }] This variable
specifies the border color to be used when high- lighting
the icon manager entry that currently has the focus, and can
only be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome
list. The optional win-list is a list of window names and
colors so that per-window colors may be specified. See the
BorderColor variable for a complete description of the
win-list. The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>IconManagers { iconmgr-list } This variable specifies a
list of icon managers to create. Each item in the
iconmgr-list has the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;winname&quot; [&quot;iconname&quot;]
&quot;geometry&quot; columns</p>

<p>where winname is the name of the windows that should be
put into this icon manager, iconname is the name of that
icon man- ager window s icon, geometry is a standard
geometry specifica- tion, and columns is the number of
columns in this icon manager as described in
IconManagerGeometry. For example:</p>

<p>IconManagers { &quot;XTerm&quot;
&quot;=300x5+800+5&quot; 5 &quot;myhost&quot;
&quot;=400x5+100+5&quot; 2 }</p>

<p>Clients whose name or class is XTerm will have an entry
created in the XTerm icon manager. Clients whose name was
myhost would be put into the myhost icon manager.</p>

<p>IconManagerShow { win-list } This variable specifies a
list of windows that should appear in the icon manager. When
used in conjunction with the IconMan- agerDontShow variable,
only the windows in this list will be shown in the icon
manager.</p>

<p>IconRegion geomstring vgrav hgrav gridwidth gridheight
This variable specifies an area on the root window in which
icons are placed if no specific icon location is provided by
the client. The geomstring is a quoted string containing a
standard geometry specification. If more than one IconRegion
lines are given, icons will be put into the succeeding icon
regions when the first is full. The vgrav argument should be
either North or South and control and is used to control
whether icons are first filled in from the top or bottom of
the icon region. Similarly, the hgrav argument should be
either East or West and is used to control whether icons
should be filled in from left from the right. Icons are laid
out within the region in a grid with cells gridwidth pixels
wide and grid- height pixels high.</p>

<p>Icons { win-list } This variable specifies a list of
window names and the bitmap filenames that should be used as
their icons. For example:</p>

<p>Icons { &quot;XTerm&quot; &quot;xterm.icon&quot;
&quot;xfd&quot; &quot;xfd_icon&quot; }</p>

<p>Windows that match XTerm and would not be iconified by
unmapping, and would try to use the icon bitmap in the file
xterm.icon . If ForceIcons is specified, this bitmap will be
used even if the client has requested its own icon
pixmap.</p>

<p>InterpolateMenuColors This variable indicates that menu
entry colors should be inter- polated between entry
specified colors. In the example below:</p>

<p>Menu &quot;mymenu&quot; { &quot;Title&quot;
(&quot;black&quot;:&quot;red&quot;) f.title
&quot;entry1&quot; f.nop &quot;entry2&quot; f.nop
&quot;entry3&quot; (&quot;white&quot;:&quot;green&quot;)
f.nop &quot;entry4&quot; f.nop &quot;entry5&quot;
(&quot;red&quot;:&quot;white&quot;) f.nop }</p>

<p>the foreground colors for entry1 and entry2 will be
interpolated between black and white, and the background
colors between red and green. Similarly, the foreground for
entry4 will be half-way between white and red, and the
background will be half-way between green and white.</p>

<p>MakeTitle { win-list } This variable specifies a list of
windows on which a titlebar should be placed and is used to
request titles on specific windows when NoTitle has been
set.</p>

<p>MaxWindowSize string This variable specifies a geometry
in which the width and height give the maximum size for a
given window. This is typi- cally used to restrict windows
to the size of the screen. The default width is 32767 -
screen width. The default height is 32767 - screen
height.</p>

<p>MenuBackground string This variable specifies the
background color used for menus, and can only be specified
inside of a Color or Monochrome list. The default is
&quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p>MenuBorderColor string This variable specifies the color
of the menu border and can only be specified inside of a
Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The default is
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>MenuBorderWidth pixels This variable specifies the width
in pixels of the border sur- rounding menu windows. The
default is 2.</p>

<p>MenuFont string This variable specifies the font to use
when displaying menus. The default is
&quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p>MenuForeground string This variable specifies the
foreground color used for menus, and can only be specified
inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list. The default
is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>MenuShadowColor string This variable specifies the color
of the shadow behind pull- down menus and can only be
specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome list.
The default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>MenuTitleBackground string This variable specifies the
background color for f.title entries in menus, and can only
be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome
list. The default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p>MenuTitleForeground string This variable specifies the
foreground color for f.title entries in menus and can only
be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome list. The
default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>Monochrome { colors } This variable specifies a list of
color assignments that should be made if the screen has a
depth of 1. See the description of Colors.</p>

<p>MoveDelta pixels This variable specifies the number of
pixels the pointer must move before the f.move function
starts working. Also see the f.deltastop function. The
default is zero pixels.</p>

<p>NoBackingStore This variable indicates that twms menus
should not request backing store to minimize repainting of
menus. This is typi- cally used with servers that can
repaint faster than they can handle backing store.</p>

<p>NoCaseSensitive This variable indicates that case should
be ignored when sort- ing icon names in an icon manager.
This option is typically used with applications that
capitalize the first letter of their icon name.</p>

<p>NoDefaults This variable indicates that twm should not
supply the default titlebuttons and bindings. This option
should only be used if the startup file contains a
completely new set of bindings and definitions.</p>

<p>NoGrabServer This variable indicates that twm should not
grab the server when popping up menus and moving opaque
windows.</p>

<p>NoHighlight [{ win-list }] This variable indicates that
borders should not be highlighted to track the location of
the pointer. If the optional win-list is given, highlighting
will only be disabled for those windows. When the border is
highlighted, it will be drawn in the current BorderColor.
When the border is not highlighted, it will be stippled with
a gray pattern using the current BorderTileFore- ground and
BorderTileBackground colors.</p>

<p>NoIconManagers This variable indicates that no icon
manager should be created.</p>

<p>NoMenuShadows This variable indicates that menus should
not have drop shadows drawn behind them. This is typically
used with slower servers since it speeds up menu drawing at
the expense of making the menu slightly harder to read.</p>

<p>NoRaiseOnDeiconify This variable indicates that windows
that are deiconified should not be raised.</p>

<p>NoRaiseOnMove This variable indicates that windows
should not be raised when moved. This is typically used to
allow windows to slide under- neath each other.</p>

<p>NoRaiseOnResize This variable indicates that windows
should not be raised when resized. This is typically used to
allow windows to be resized underneath each other.</p>

<p>NoRaiseOnWarp This variable indicates that windows
should not be raised when the pointer is warped into them
with the f.warpto function. If this option is set, warping
to an occluded window may result in the pointer ending up in
the occluding window instead the desired window (which
causes unexpected behavior with f.warpring).</p>

<p>NoSaveUnders This variable indicates that menus should
not request save- unders to minimize window repainting
following menu selection. It is typically used with displays
that can repaint faster than they can handle
save-unders.</p>

<p>NoStackMode [{ win-list }] This variable indicates that
client window requests to change stacking order should be
ignored. If the optional win-list is given, only requests on
those windows will be ignored. This is typically used to
prevent applications from relentlessly pop- ping themselves
to the front of the window stack.</p>

<p>NoTitle [{ win-list }] This variable indicates that
windows should not have titlebars. If the optional win-list
is given, only those windows will not have titlebars.
MakeTitle may be used with this option to force titlebars to
be put on specific windows.</p>

<p>NoTitleFocus This variable indicates that twm should not
set keyboard input focus to each window as it is entered.
Normally, twm sets the focus so that focus and key events
from the titlebar and icon managers are delivered to the
application. If the pointer is moved quickly and twm is slow
to respond, input can be directed to the old window instead
of the new. This option is typically used to prevent this
input lag and to work around bugs in older applications that
have problems with focus events.</p>

<p>NoTitleHighlight [{ win-list }] This variable indicates
that the highlight area of the title- bar, which is used to
indicate the window that currently has the input focus,
should not be displayed. If the optional win- list is given,
only those windows will not have highlight areas. This and
the SqueezeTitle options can be set to sub- stantially
reduce the amount of screen space required by title-
bars.</p>

<p>OpaqueMove This variable indicates that the f.move
function should actu- ally move the window instead of just
an outline so that the user can immediately see what the
window will look like in the new position. This option is
typically used on fast displays (particularly if
NoGrabServer is set).</p>

<p>Pixmaps { pixmaps } This variable specifies a list of
pixmaps that define the appearance of various images. Each
entry is a keyword indicat- ing the pixmap to set, followed
by a string giving the name of the bitmap file. The
following pixmaps may be specified:</p>

<p>Pixmaps { TitleHighlight &quot;gray1&quot; }</p>

<p>The default for TitleHighlight is to use an even stipple
pat- tern.</p>

<p>Priority priority This variable sets twm s priority.
priority should be an unquoted, signed number (e.g. 999).
This variable has an effect only if the server supports the
SYNC extension.</p>

<p>RandomPlacement This variable indicates that windows
with no specified geometry should be placed in a
pseudo-random location instead of having the user drag out
an outline.</p>

<p>ResizeFont string This variable specifies the font to be
used for in the dimen- sions window when resizing windows.
The default is &quot;fixed&quot;.</p>

<p>RestartPreviousState This variable indicates that twm
should attempt to use the WM_STATE property on client
windows to tell which windows should be iconified and which
should be left visible. This is typically used to try to
regenerate the state that the screen was in before the
previous window manager was shutdown.</p>

<p>SaveColor { colors-list } This variable indicates a list
of color assignments to be stored as pixel values in the
root window property _MIT_PRIOR- ITY_COLORS. Clients may
elect to preserve these values when installing their own
colormap. Note that use of this mechanism is a way an for
application to avoid the &quot;technicolor&quot; problem,
whereby useful screen objects such as window borders and
title- bars disappear when a programs custom colors are
installed by the window manager. For example:</p>

<p>SaveColor { BorderColor TitleBackground TitleForeground
&quot;red&quot; &quot;green&quot; &quot;blue&quot; }</p>

<p>This would place on the root window 3 pixel values for
borders and titlebars, as well as the three color strings,
all taken from the default colormap.</p>

<p>ShowIconManager This variable indicates that the icon
manager window should be displayed when twm is started. It
can always be brought up using the f.showiconmgr
function.</p>

<p>SortIconManager This variable indicates that entries in
the icon manager should be sorted alphabetically rather than
by simply appending new windows to the end.</p>

<p>SqueezeTitle [{ squeeze-list }] This variable indicates
that twm should attempt to use the SHAPE extension to make
titlebars occupy only as much screen space as they need,
rather than extending all the way across the top of the
window. The optional squeeze-list may be used to control the
location of the squeezed titlebar along the top of the
window. It contains entries of the form:</p>

<p>&quot;name&quot; justification num denom</p>

<p>where name is a window name, justification is either
left, cen- ter, or right, and num and denom are numbers
specifying a ratio giving the relative position about which
the titlebar is justi- fied. The ratio is measured from left
to right if the numera- tor is positive, and right to left
if negative. A denominator of 0 indicates that the numerator
should be measured in pixels. For convenience, the ratio 0/0
is the same as 1/2 for center and -1/1 for right. For
example:</p>

<p>SqueezeTitle { &quot;XTerm&quot; left 0 0
&quot;xterm1&quot; left 1 3 &quot;xterm2&quot; left 2 3
&quot;oclock&quot; center 0 0 &quot;emacs&quot; right 0 0
}</p>

<p>The DontSqueezeTitle list can be used to turn off
squeezing on certain titles.</p>

<p>StartIconified [{ win-list }] This variable indicates
that client windows should initially be left as icons until
explicitly deiconified by the user. If the optional win-list
is given, only those windows will be started iconic. This is
useful for programs that do not support an -iconic command
line option or resource.</p>

<p>TitleBackground string [{ win-list }] This variable
specifies the background color used in titlebars, and may
only be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome
list. The optional win-list is a list of window names and
colors so that per-window colors may be specified. The
default is &quot;white&quot;.</p>

<p>TitleButtonBorderWidth pixels This variable specifies
the width in pixels of the border sur- rounding
titlebuttons. This is typically set to 0 to allow
titlebuttons to take up as much space as possible and to not
have a border. The default is 1.</p>

<p>TitleFont string This variable specifies the font to be
used for displaying win- dow names in titlebars. The default
is &quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p>TitleForeground string [{ win-list }] This variable
specifies the foreground color used in titlebars, and may
only be specified inside of a Color, Grayscale or Monochrome
list. The optional win-list is a list of window names and
colors so that per-window colors may be specified. The
default is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p>TitlePadding pixels This variable specifies the distance
between the various but- tons, text, and highlight areas in
the titlebar. The default is 8 pixels.</p>

<p>UnknownIcon string This variable specifies the filename
of a bitmap file to be used as the default icon. This bitmap
will be used as the icon of all clients which do not provide
an icon bitmap and are not listed in the Icons list.</p>

<p>UsePPosition string This variable specifies whether or
not twm should honor pro- gram-requested locations (given by
the PPosition flag in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property) in the
absence of a user-specified position. The argument string
may have one of three values: &quot;off&quot; (the default)
indicating that twm should ignore the pro- gram-supplied
position, &quot;on&quot; indicating that the position should
be used, and &quot;non-zero&quot; indicating that the
position should used if it is other than (0,0). The latter
option is for working around a bug in older toolkits.</p>

<p>WarpCursor [{ win-list }] This variable indicates that
the pointer should be warped into windows when they are
deiconified. If the optional win-list is given, the pointer
will only be warped when those windows are deiconified.</p>

<p>WindowRing { win-list } This variable specifies a list
of windows along which the f.warpring function cycles.</p>

<p>WarpUnmapped This variable indicates that the f.warpto
function should deiconify any iconified windows it
encounters. This is typi- cally used to make a key binding
that will pop a particular window (such as xmh), no matter
where it is. The default is for f.warpto to ignore iconified
windows.</p>

<p>XorValue number This variable specifies the value to use
when drawing window outlines for moving and resizing. This
should be set to a value that will result in a variety of of
distinguishable col- ors when exclusive-ored with the
contents of the users typi- cal screen. Setting this
variable to 1 often gives nice results if adjacent colors in
the default colormap are dis- tinct. By default, twm will
attempt to cause temporary lines to appear at the opposite
end of the colormap from the graph- ics.</p>

<p>Zoom [ count ] This variable indicates that outlines
suggesting movement of a window to and from its iconified
state should be displayed whenever a window is iconified or
deiconified. The optional count argument specifies the
number of outlines to be drawn. The default count is 8.</p>

<p>The following variables must be set after the fonts have
been assigned, so it is usually best to put them at the end
of the variables or begin- ning of the bindings
sections:</p>

<p>DefaultFunction function This variable specifies the
function to be executed when a key or button event is
received for which no binding is provided. This is typically
bound to f.nop, f.beep, or a menu containing window
operations.</p>

<p>WindowFunction function This variable specifies the
function to execute when a window is selected from the
TwmWindows menu. If this variable is not set, the window
will be deiconified and raised.</p>

<p>BINDINGS After the desired variables have been set,
functions may be attached titlebuttons and key and pointer
buttons. Titlebuttons may be added from the left or right
side and appear in the titlebar from left-to- right
according to the order in which they are specified. Key and
pointer button bindings may be given in any order.</p>

<p>Titlebuttons specifications must include the name of the
pixmap to use in the button box and the function to be
invoked when a pointer button is pressed within them:</p>

<p>LeftTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; = function</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>RightTitleButton &quot;bitmapname&quot; = function</p>

<p>The bitmapname may refer to one of the built-in bitmaps
(which are scaled to match TitleFont) by using the
appropriate colon-prefixed name described above.</p>

<p>Key and pointer button specifications must give the
modifiers that must be pressed, over which parts of the
screen the pointer must be, and what function is to be
invoked. Keys are given as strings containing the
appropriate keysym name; buttons are given as the keywords
But- ton1-Button5:</p>

<p>&quot;FP1&quot; = modlist : context : function Button1 =
modlist : context : function</p>

<p>The modlist is any combination of the modifier names
shift, control, lock, meta, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, or mod5
(which may be abbreviated as s, c, l, m, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5,
respectively) separated by a verti- cal bar (|). Similarly,
the context is any combination of window, title, icon, root,
frame, iconmgr, their first letters (iconmgr abbre- viation
is m), or all, separated by a vertical bar. The function is
any of the f. keywords described below. For example, the
default startup file contains the following bindings:</p>

<p>Button1 = : root : f.menu &quot;TwmWindows&quot; Button1
= m : window | icon : f.function &quot;move-or-lower&quot;
Button2 = m : window | icon : f.iconify Button3 = m : window
| icon : f.function &quot;move-or-raise&quot; Button1 = :
title : f.function &quot;move-or-raise&quot; Button2 = :
title : f.raiselower Button1 = : icon : f.function
&quot;move-or-iconify&quot; Button2 = : icon : f.iconify
Button1 = : iconmgr : f.iconify Button2 = : iconmgr :
f.iconify</p>

<p>A user who wanted to be able to manipulate windows from
the keyboard could use the following bindings:</p>

<p>&quot;F1&quot; = : all : f.iconify &quot;F2&quot; = :
all : f.raiselower &quot;F3&quot; = : all : f.warpring
&quot;next&quot; &quot;F4&quot; = : all : f.warpto
&quot;xmh&quot; &quot;F5&quot; = : all : f.warpto
&quot;emacs&quot; &quot;F6&quot; = : all : f.colormap
&quot;next&quot; &quot;F7&quot; = : all : f.colormap
&quot;default&quot; &quot;F20&quot; = : all : f.warptoscreen
&quot;next&quot; &quot;Left&quot; = m : all : f.backiconmgr
&quot;Right&quot; = m | s : all : f.forwiconmgr
&quot;Up&quot; = m : all : f.upiconmgr &quot;Down&quot; = m
| s : all : f.downiconmgr</p>

<p>Twm provides many more window manipulation primitives
than can be con- veniently stored in a titlebar, menu, or
set of key bindings. Although a small set of defaults are
supplied (unless the NoDefaults is speci- fied), most users
will want to have their most common operations bound to key
and button strokes. To do this, twm associates names with
each of the primitives and provides user-defined functions
for building higher level primitives and menus for
interactively selecting among groups of functions.</p>

<p>User-defined functions contain the name by which they
are referenced in calls to f.function and a list of other
functions to execute. For example:</p>

<p>Function &quot;move-or-lower&quot; { f.move f.deltastop
f.lower } Function &quot;move-or-raise&quot; { f.move
f.deltastop f.raise } Function &quot;move-or-iconify&quot; {
f.move f.deltastop f.iconify } Function
&quot;restore-colormap&quot; { f.colormap
&quot;default&quot; f.lower }</p>

<p>The function name must be used in f.function exactly as
it appears in the function specification.</p>

<p>In the descriptions below, if the function is said to
operate on the selected window, but is invoked from a root
menu, the cursor will be changed to the Select cursor and
the next window to receive a button press will be
chosen:</p>

<p>! string This is an abbreviation for f.exec string.</p>

<p>f.autoraise This function toggles whether or not the
selected window is raised whenever entered by the pointer.
See the description of the variable AutoRaise.</p>

<p>f.backiconmgr This function warps the pointer to the
previous column in the current icon manager, wrapping back
to the previous row if nec- essary.</p>

<p>f.beep This function sounds the keyboard bell.</p>

<p>f.bottomzoom This function is similar to the f.fullzoom
function, but resizes the window to fill only the bottom
half of the screen.</p>

<p>f.circledown This function lowers the top-most window
that occludes another window.</p>

<p>f.circleup This function raises the bottom-most window
that is occluded by another window.</p>

<p>f.colormap string This function rotates the colormaps
(obtained from the WM_COL- ORMAP_WINDOWS property on the
window) that twm will display when the pointer is in this
window. The argument string may have one of the following
values: &quot;next&quot;, &quot;prev&quot;, and
&quot;default&quot;. It should be noted here that in
general, the installed colormap is determined by keyboard
focus. A pointer driven keyboard focus will install a
private colormap upon entry of the window owning the
colormap. Using the click to type model, private colormaps
will not be installed until the user presses a mouse button
on the target window.</p>

<p>f.deiconify This function deiconifies the selected
window. If the window is not an icon, this function does
nothing.</p>

<p>f.delete This function sends the WM_DELETE_WINDOW
message to the selected window if the client application has
requested it through the WM_PROTOCOLS window property. The
application is supposed to respond to the message by
removing the indicated window. If the window has not
requested WM_DELETE_WINDOW mes- sages, the keyboard bell
will be rung indicating that the user should choose an
alternative method. Note this is very differ- ent from
f.destroy. The intent here is to delete a single win- dow,
not necessarily the entire application.</p>

<p>f.deltastop This function allows a user-defined function
to be aborted if the pointer has been moved more than
MoveDelta pixels. See the example definition given for
Function &quot;move-or-raise&quot; at the beginning of the
section.</p>

<p>f.destroy This function instructs the X server to close
the display con- nection of the client that created the
selected window. This should only be used as a last resort
for shutting down runaway clients. See also f.delete.</p>

<p>f.downiconmgr This function warps the pointer to the
next row in the current icon manger, wrapping to the
beginning of the next column if necessary.</p>

<p>f.exec string This function passes the argument string
to /bin/sh for execu- tion. In multiscreen mode, if string
starts a new X client without giving a display argument, the
client will appear on the screen from which this function
was invoked.</p>

<p>f.focus This function toggles the keyboard focus of the
server to the selected window, changing the focus rule from
pointer-driven if necessary. If the selected window already
was focused, this function executes an f.unfocus.</p>

<p>f.forcemove This function is like f.move except that it
ignores the Dont- MoveOff variable.</p>

<p>f.forwiconmgr This function warps the pointer to the
next column in the cur- rent icon manager, wrapping to the
beginning of the next row if necessary.</p>

<p>f.fullzoom This function resizes the selected window to
the full size of the display or else restores the original
size if the window was already zoomed.</p>

<p>f.function string This function executes the
user-defined function whose name is specified by the
argument string.</p>

<p>f.hbzoom This function is a synonym for
f.bottomzoom.</p>

<p>f.hideiconmgr This function unmaps the current icon
manager.</p>

<p>f.horizoom This variable is similar to the f.zoom
function except that the selected window is resized to the
full width of the display.</p>

<p>f.htzoom This function is a synonym for f.topzoom.</p>

<p>f.hzoom This function is a synonym for f.horizoom.</p>

<p>f.iconify This function iconifies or deiconifies the
selected window or icon, respectively.</p>

<p>f.identify This function displays a summary of the name
and geometry of the selected window. If the server supports
the SYNC exten- sion, the priority of the client owning the
window is also dis- played. Clicking the pointer or pressing
a key in the window will dismiss it.</p>

<p>f.lefticonmgr This function similar to f.backiconmgr
except that wrapping does not change rows.</p>

<p>f.leftzoom This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom
function but causes the selected window is only resized to
the left half of the display.</p>

<p>f.lower This function lowers the selected window.</p>

<p>f.menu string This function invokes the menu specified
by the argument string. Cascaded menus may be built by
nesting calls to f.menu.</p>

<p>f.move This function drags an outline of the selected
window (or the window itself if the OpaqueMove variable is
set) until the invoking pointer button is released. Double
clicking within the number of milliseconds given by
ConstrainedMoveTime warps the pointer to the center of the
window and constrains the move to be either horizontal or
vertical depending on which grid line is crossed. To abort a
move, press another button before releasing the first
button.</p>

<p>f.nexticonmgr This function warps the pointer to the
next icon manager con- taining any windows on the current or
any succeeding screen.</p>

<p>f.nop This function does nothing and is typically used
with the DefaultFunction or WindowFunction variables or to
introduce blank lines in menus.</p>

<p>f.previconmgr This function warps the pointer to the
previous icon manager containing any windows on the current
or preceding screens.</p>

<p>f.priority string This function sets the priority of the
client owning the selected window to the numeric value of
the argument string, which should be a signed integer in
double quotes (e.g. &quot;999&quot; ). This function has an
effect only if the server supports the SYNC extension.</p>

<p>f.quit This function causes twm to restore the windows
borders and exit. If twm is the first client invoked from
xdm, this will result in a server reset.</p>

<p>f.raise This function raises the selected window.</p>

<p>f.raiselower This function raises the selected window to
the top of the stacking order if it is occluded by any
windows, otherwise the window will be lowered.</p>

<p>f.refresh This function causes all windows to be
refreshed.</p>

<p>f.resize This function displays an outline of the
selected window. Crossing a border (or setting
AutoRelativeResize) will cause the outline to begin to
rubber band until the invoking button is released. To abort
a resize, press another button before releasing the first
button.</p>

<p>f.restart This function kills and restarts twm.</p>

<p>f.startwm string This function kills twm and starts
another window manager, as specified by string.</p>

<p>f.righticonmgr This function is similar to f.nexticonmgr
except that wrapping does not change rows.</p>

<p>f.rightzoom This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom
function except that the selected window is only resized to
the right half of the display.</p>

<p>f.saveyourself This function sends a WM_SAVEYOURSELF
message to the selected window if it has requested the
message in its WM_PROTOCOLS win- dow property. Clients that
accept this message are supposed to checkpoint all state
associated with the window and update the WM_COMMAND
property as specified in the ICCCM. If the selected window
has not selected for this message, the keyboard bell will be
rung.</p>

<p>f.showiconmgr This function maps the current icon
manager.</p>

<p>f.sorticonmgr This function sorts the entries in the
current icon manager alphabetically. See the variable
SortIconManager.</p>

<p>f.title This function provides a centered, unselectable
item in a menu definition. It should not be used in any
other context.</p>

<p>f.topzoom This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom
function except that the selected window is only resized to
the top half of the display.</p>

<p>f.unfocus This function resets the focus back to
pointer-driven. This should be used when a focused window is
no longer desired.</p>

<p>f.upiconmgr This function warps the pointer to the
previous row in the cur- rent icon manager, wrapping to the
last row in the same column if necessary.</p>

<p>f.vlzoom This function is a synonym for f.leftzoom.</p>

<p>f.vrzoom This function is a synonym for f.rightzoom.</p>

<p>f.warpring string This function warps the pointer to the
next or previous window (as indicated by the argument
string, which may be &quot;next&quot; or &quot;prev&quot;)
specified in the WindowRing variable.</p>

<p>f.warpto string This function warps the pointer to the
window which has a name or class that matches string. If the
window is iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable
WarpUnmapped is set or else ignored.</p>

<p>f.warptoiconmgr string This function warps the pointer
to the icon manager entry asso- ciated with the window
containing the pointer in the icon man- ager specified by
the argument string. If string is empty (i.e. &quot;&quot;),
the current icon manager is chosen.</p>

<p>f.warptoscreen string This function warps the pointer to
the screen specified by the argument string. String may be a
number (e.g. &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;), the word
&quot;next&quot; (indicating the current screen plus 1,
skipping over any unmanaged screens), the word
&quot;back&quot; (indicating the current screen minus 1,
skipping over any unmanaged screens), or the word
&quot;prev&quot; (indicating the last screen visited.</p>

<p>f.winrefresh This function is similar to the f.refresh
function except that only the selected window is
refreshed.</p>

<p>f.zoom This function is similar to the f.fullzoom
function, except that the only the height of the selected
window is changed.</p>

<p>MENUS Functions may be grouped and interactively
selected using pop-up (when bound to a pointer button) or
pull-down (when associated with a title- button) menus. Each
menu specification contains the name of the menu as it will
be referred to by f.menu, optional default foreground and
background colors, the list of item names and the functions
they should invoke, and optional foreground and background
colors for individual items:</p>

<p>Menu &quot;menuname&quot; [
(&quot;deffore&quot;:&quot;defback&quot;) ] { string1 [
(&quot;fore1&quot;:&quot;backn&quot;)] function1 string2 [
(&quot;fore2&quot;:&quot;backn&quot;)] function2 . . .
stringN [ (&quot;foreN&quot;:&quot;backN&quot;)] functionN
}</p>

<p>The menuname is case-sensitive. The optional deffore and
defback argu- ments specify the foreground and background
colors used on a color dis- play to highlight menu entries.
The string portion of each menu entry will be the text which
will appear in the menu. The optional fore and back
arguments specify the foreground and background colors of
the menu entry when the pointer is not in the entry. These
colors will only be used on a color display. The default is
to use the colors specified by the MenuForeground and
MenuBackground variables. The function portion of the menu
entry is one of the functions, including any user-defined
functions, or additional menus.</p>

<p>There is a special menu named TwmWindows which contains
the names of all of the client and twm-supplied windows.
Selecting an entry will cause the WindowFunction to be
executed on that window. If WindowFunc- tion hasn t been
set, the window will be deiconified and raised.</p>

<p>ICONS Twm supports several different ways of
manipulating iconified windows. The common pixmap-and-text
style may be laid out by hand or automati- cally arranged as
described by the IconRegion variable. In addition, a terse
grid of icon names, called an icon manager, provides a more
effi- cient use of screen space as well as the ability to
navigate among windows from the keyboard.</p>

<p>An icon manager is a window that contains names of
selected or all win- dows currently on the display. In
addition to the window name, a small button using the
default iconify symbol will be displayed to the left of the
name when the window is iconified. By default, clicking on
an entry in the icon manager performs f.iconify. To change
the actions taken in the icon manager, use the the iconmgr
context when specifying button and keyboard bindings.</p>

<p>Moving the pointer into the icon manager also directs
keyboard focus to the indicated window (setting the focus
explicitly or else sending syn- thetic events NoTitleFocus
is set). Using the f.upiconmgr, f.downicon- mgr
f.lefticonmgr, and f.righticonmgr functions, the input focus
can be changed between windows directly from the
keyboard.</p>

<p>BUGS The resource manager should have been used instead
of all of the window lists.</p>

<p>The IconRegion variable should take a list.</p>

<p>Double clicking very fast to get the constrained move
function will sometimes cause the window to move, even
though the pointer is not moved.</p>

<p>If IconifyByUnmapping is on and windows are listed in
IconManager- DontShow but not in DontIconifyByUnmapping,
they may be lost if they are iconified and no bindings to
f.menu &quot;TwmWindows&quot; or f.warpto are setup.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.twmrc.&lt;screen number&gt; $HOME/.twmrc
/usr/lib/X11/twm/system.twmrc</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DISPLAY This variable is used to
determine which X server to use. It is also set during
f.exec so that programs come up on the proper screen.</p>

<p>HOME This variable is used as the prefix for files that
begin with a tilde and for locating the twm startup
file.</p>
