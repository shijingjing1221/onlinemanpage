<p>TYPEDEF HANDLE_T(9) The Linux Journalling API TYPEDEF
HANDLE_T(9)</p>

<p>NAME typedef_handle_t - The handle_t type represents a
single atomic update being performed by some process.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS typedef handle_t;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All filesystem modifications made by the
process go through this handle. Recursive operations (such
as quota operations) are gathered into a single update.</p>

<p>The buffer credits field is used to account for
journaled buffers being modified by the running process. To
ensure that there is enough log space for all outstanding
operations, we need to limit the number of outstanding
buffers possible at any time. When the operation completes,
any buffer credits not used are credited back to the
transaction, so that at all times we know how many buffers
the outstanding updates on a transaction might possibly
touch.</p>

<p>This is an opaque datatype.</p>
