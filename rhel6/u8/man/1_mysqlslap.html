<p>NAME mysqlslap - load emulation client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqlslap [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mysqlslap is a diagnostic program designed
to emulate client load for a MySQL server and to report the
timing of each stage. It works as if multiple clients are
accessing the server. mysqlslap is available as of MySQL
5.1.4.</p>

<p>Invoke mysqlslap like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlslap [options]</p>

<p>Some options such as --create or --query enable you to
specify a string containing an SQL statement or a file
containing statements. If you specify a file, by default it
must contain one statement per line. (That is, the implicit
statement delimiter is the newline character.) Use the
--delimiter option to specify a different delimiter, which
enables you to specify statements that span multiple lines
or place multiple statements on a single line. You cannot
include comments in a file; mysqlslap does not understand
them.</p>

<p>mysqlslap runs in three stages:</p>

<p>1. Create schema, table, and optionally any stored
programs or data to use for the test. This stage uses a
single client connection.</p>

<p>2. Run the load test. This stage can use many client
connections.</p>

<p>3. Clean up (disconnect, drop table if specified). This
stage uses a single client connection.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Supply your own create and query SQL statements, with 50
clients querying and 200 selects for each (enter the command
on a single line):</p>

<p>mysqlslap --delimiter=&quot;;&quot;
--create=&quot;CREATE TABLE a (b int);INSERT INTO a VALUES
(23)&quot; --query=&quot;SELECT * FROM a&quot;
--concurrency=50 --iterations=200</p>

<p>Let mysqlslap build the query SQL statement with a table
of two INT columns and three VARCHAR columns. Use five
clients querying 20 times each. Do not create the table or
insert the data (that is, use the previous test&rsquo;s
schema and data):</p>

<p>mysqlslap --concurrency=5 --iterations=20
--number-int-cols=2 --number-char-cols=3
--auto-generate-sql</p>

<p>Tell the program to load the create, insert, and query
SQL statements from the specified files, where the
create.sql file has multiple table creation statements
delimited by &rsquo;;&rsquo; and multiple insert statements
delimited by &rsquo;;&rsquo;. The --query file will have
multiple queries delimited by &rsquo;;&rsquo;. Run all the
load statements, then run all the queries in the query file
with five clients (five times each):</p>

<p>mysqlslap --concurrency=5 --iterations=5
--query=query.sql --create=create.sql
--delimiter=&quot;;&quot;</p>

<p>mysqlslap supports the following options, which can be
specified on the command line or in the [mysqlslap] and
[client] groups of an option file. mysqlslap also supports
the options for processing option files described at Section
4.2.3.4, Command-Line Options that Affect Option- File
Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql, -a</p>

<p>Generate SQL statements automatically when they are not
supplied in files or using command options.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-add-autoincrement</p>

<p>Add an AUTO_INCREMENT column to automatically generated
tables. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-execute-number=N</p>

<p>Specify how many queries to generate automatically. This
option was added in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-guid-primary</p>

<p>Add a GUID-based primary key to automatically generated
tables. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-load-type=type</p>

<p>Specify the test load type. The permissible values are
read (scan tables), write (insert into tables), key (read
primary keys), update (update primary keys), or mixed (half
inserts, half scanning selects). The default is mixed. This
option was added in MySQL 5.1.16.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-secondary-indexes=N</p>

<p>Specify how many secondary indexes to add to
automatically generated tables. By default, none are added.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-unique-query-number=N</p>

<p>How many different queries to generate for automatic
tests. For example, if you run a key test that performs 1000
selects, you can use this option with a value of 1000 to run
1000 unique queries, or with a value of 50 to perform 50
different selects. The default is 10. This option was added
in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-unique-write-number=N</p>

<p>How many different queries to generate for
--auto-generate-sql-write-number. The default is 10. This
option was added in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --auto-generate-sql-write-number=N</p>

<p>How many row inserts to perform on each thread. The
default is 100. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.16.</p>

<p>&middot; --commit=N</p>

<p>How many statements to execute before committing. The
default is 0 (no commits are done). This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --compress, -C</p>

<p>Compress all information sent between the client and the
server if both support compression.</p>

<p>&middot; --concurrency=N, -c N</p>

<p>The number of clients to simulate when issuing the
SELECT statement.</p>

<p>&middot; --create=value</p>

<p>The file or string containing the statement to use for
creating the table.</p>

<p>&middot; --create-schema=value</p>

<p>The schema in which to run the tests. This option was
added in MySQL 5.1.5.</p>

<p>Note If the --auto-generate-sql option is also given,
mysqlslap drops the schema at the end of the test run. To
avoid this, use the --no-drop option as well.</p>

<p>&middot; --csv[=file_name]</p>

<p>Generate output in comma-separated values format. The
output goes to the named file, or to the standard output if
no file is given. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]</p>

<p>Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
&rsquo;d:t:o,file_name&rsquo;. The default is
&rsquo;d:t:o,/tmp/mysqlslap.trace&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-check</p>

<p>Print some debugging information when the program exits.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-info, -T</p>

<p>Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
statistics when the program exits. This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --delimiter=str, -F str</p>

<p>The delimiter to use in SQL statements supplied in files
or using command options.</p>

<p>&middot; --detach=N</p>

<p>Detach (close and reopen) each connection after each N
statements. The default is 0 (connections are not detached).
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --engine=engine_name, -e engine_name</p>

<p>The storage engine to use for creating tables.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name, -h host_name</p>

<p>Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.</p>

<p>&middot; --iterations=N, -i N</p>

<p>The number of times to run the tests.</p>

<p>&middot; --lock-directory=path</p>

<p>The directory to use for storing locks. This option was
added in MySQL 5.1.5 and removed in 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-drop</p>

<p>Prevent mysqlslap from dropping any schema it creates
during the test run. This option was added in MySQL
5.1.57.</p>

<p>&middot; --number-char-cols=N, -x N</p>

<p>The number of VARCHAR columns to use if
--auto-generate-sql is specified.</p>

<p>&middot; --number-int-cols=N, -y N</p>

<p>The number of INT columns to use if --auto-generate-sql
is specified.</p>

<p>&middot; --number-of-queries=N</p>

<p>Limit each client to approximately this many queries.
Query counting takes into account the statement delimiter.
For example, if you invoke mysqlslap as follows, the ;
delimiter is recognized so that each instance of the query
string counts as two queries. As a result, 5 rows (not 10)
are inserted.</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlslap --delimiter=&quot;;&quot;
--number-of-queries=10 --query=&quot;use test;insert into t
values(null)&quot;</p>

<p>This option was added in MySQL 5.1.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --only-print</p>

<p>Do not connect to databases. mysqlslap only prints what
it would have done. This option was added in MySQL
5.1.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --password[=password], -p[password]</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. If
you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space
between the option and the password. If you omit the
password value following the --password or -p option on the
command line, mysqlslap prompts for one.</p>

<p>Specifying a password on the command line should be
considered insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, End-User
Guidelines for Password Security. You can use an option file
to avoid giving the password on the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --pipe, -W</p>

<p>On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe.
This option applies only if the server supports named-pipe
connections.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num, -P port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.</p>

<p>&middot; --post-query=value</p>

<p>The file or string containing the statement to execute
after the tests have completed. This execution is not
counted for timing purposes. This option was added in MySQL
5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --shared-memory-base-name=name</p>

<p>On Windows, the shared-memory name to use, for
connections made using shared memory to a local server. This
option applies only if the server supports shared-memory
connections.</p>

<p>&middot; --post-system=str</p>

<p>The string to execute using system() after the tests
have completed. This execution is not counted for timing
purposes. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --pre-query=value</p>

<p>The file or string containing the statement to execute
before running the tests. This execution is not counted for
timing purposes. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --pre-system=str</p>

<p>The string to execute using system() before running the
tests. This execution is not counted for timing purposes.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --preserve-schema</p>

<p>Preserve the schema from the mysqlslap run. The
--auto-generate-sql and --create options disable this
option. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.5 and removed in
MySQL 5.1.23.</p>

<p>&middot; --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</p>

<p>The connection protocol to use for connecting to the
server. It is useful when the other connection parameters
normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the
one you want. For details on the permissible values, see
Section 4.2.2, Connecting to the MySQL Server.</p>

<p>&middot; --query=value, -q value</p>

<p>The file or string containing the SELECT statement to
use for retrieving data.</p>

<p>&middot; --silent, -s</p>

<p>Silent mode. No output.</p>

<p>&middot; --slave</p>

<p>Follow master locks for other mysqlslap clients. Use
this option if you are trying to synchronize around one
master server with --lock-directory plus NFS. This option
was added in MySQL 5.1.5 and removed in 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path, -S path</p>

<p>For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to
use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.</p>

<p>&middot; --ssl*</p>

<p>Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect
to the server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys
and certificates. See Section 6.3.6.4, SSL Command Options
.</p>

<p>&middot; --use-threads</p>

<p>On Unix, the default is to use fork() calls and this
option causes pthread calls to be used instead. (On Windows,
the default is to use pthread calls and the option has no
effect.) This option was added in MySQL 5.1.6 and removed in
5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the
server.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
program does. This option can be used multiple times to
increase the amount of information.</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>
