<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME foreach - Iterate over all elements in one or more
lists</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS foreach varname list body foreach varlist1
list1 ?varlist2 list2 ...? body
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The foreach command implements a loop where
the loop variable(s) take on values from one or more lists.
In the simplest case there is one loop variable, varname,
and one list, list, that is a list of values to assign to
varname. The body argument is a Tcl script. For each ele-
ment of list (in order from first to last), foreach assigns
the con- tents of the element to varname as if the lindex
command had been used to extract the element, then calls the
Tcl interpreter to execute body.</p>

<p>In the general case there can be more than one value
list (e.g., list1 and list2), and each value list can be
associated with a list of loop variables (e.g., varlist1 and
varlist2). During each iteration of the loop the variables
of each varlist are assigned consecutive values from the
corresponding list. Values in each list are used in order
from first to last, and each value is used exactly once. The
total number of loop iterations is large enough to use up
all the values from all the value lists. If a value list
does not contain enough elements for each of its loop
variables in each iteration, empty values are used for the
missing elements.</p>

<p>The break and continue statements may be invoked inside
body, with the same effect as in the for command. Foreach
returns an empty string.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This loop prints every value in a list together
with the square and cube of the value: set values {1 3 5 7 2
4 6 8} ;# Odd numbers first, for fun! puts
&quot;ValueSquareCube&quot; ;# Neat-looking header foreach x
$values { ;# Now loop and print... puts &quot; $x [expr
{$x**2}] [expr {$x**3}]&quot; }</p>

<p>The following loop uses i and j as loop variables to
iterate over pairs of elements of a single list. set x {}
foreach {i j} {a b c d e f} { lappend x $j $i } # The value
of x is &quot;b a d c f e&quot; # There are 3 iterations of
the loop.</p>

<p>The next loop uses i and j to iterate over two lists in
parallel. set x {} foreach i {a b c} j {d e f g} { lappend x
$i $j } # The value of x is &quot;a d b e c f {} g&quot; #
There are 4 iterations of the loop.</p>

<p>The two forms are combined in the following example. set
x {} foreach i {a b c} {j k} {d e f g} { lappend x $i $j $k
} # The value of x is &quot;a d e b f g c {} {}&quot; #
There are 3 iterations of the loop.</p>
