<p>SETLOCALE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SETLOCALE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setlocale - set program locale</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;locale.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setlocale() function selects the
appropriate piece of the programs locale, as specified by
the category and locale arguments, and may be used to change
or query the programs entire locale or portions thereof. The
value LC_ALL for category names the programs entire locale;
other values for category name only a part of the programs
locale:</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE Affects the behavior of regular expressions
and the collation functions.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Affects the behavior of regular expressions,
character classifi- cation, character conversion functions,
and wide-character func- tions.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Affects what strings are expected by
commands and utilities as affirmative or negative
responses.</p>

<p>It also affects what strings are given by commands and
utilities as affirmative or negative responses, and the
content of messages.</p>

<p>LC_MONETARY Affects the behavior of functions that
handle monetary values.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC Affects the behavior of functions that handle
numeric values.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Affects the behavior of the time conversion
functions.</p>

<p>The locale argument is a pointer to a character string
containing the required setting of category. The contents of
this string are implemen- tation-defined. In addition, the
following preset values of locale are defined for all
settings of category:</p>

<p>&quot;POSIX&quot; Specifies the minimal environment for
C-language translation called the POSIX locale. If
setlocale() is not invoked, the POSIX locale is the default
at entry to main().</p>

<p>&quot;C&quot; Equivalent to &quot;POSIX&quot; .</p>

<p>&quot;&quot; Specifies an implementation-defined native
environment. This corresponds to the value of the associated
environment variables, LC_* and LANG ; see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7,
Locale and the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Vari- ables.</p>

<p>A null pointer Used to direct setlocale() to query the
current international- ized environment and return the name
of the locale.</p>

<p>The locale state is common to all threads within a
process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, setlocale()
shall return the string associ- ated with the specified
category for the new locale. Otherwise, setlo- cale() shall
return a null pointer and the program s locale is not
changed.</p>

<p>A null pointer for locale causes setlocale() to return a
pointer to the string associated with the category for the
program s current locale. The programs locale shall not be
changed.</p>

<p>The string returned by setlocale() is such that a
subsequent call with that string and its associated category
shall restore that part of the program s locale. The
application shall not modify the string returned which may
be overwritten by a subsequent call to setlocale().</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The following code illustrates how a
program can initialize the inter- national environment for
one language, while selectively modifying the program s
locale such that regular expressions and string operations
can be applied to text recorded in a different language:</p>

<p>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;De&quot;); setlocale(LC_COLLATE,
&quot;Fr@dict&quot;);</p>

<p>Internationalized programs must call setlocale() to
initiate a specific language operation. This can be done by
calling setlocale() as follows:</p>

<p>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;);</p>

<p>Changing the setting of LC_MESSAGES has no effect on
catalogs that have already been opened by calls to
catopen().</p>

<p>RATIONALE The ISO C standard defines a collection of
functions to support inter- nationalization. One of the most
significant aspects of these func- tions is a facility to
set and query the international environment. The
international environment is a repository of information
that affects the behavior of certain functionality,
namely:</p>

<p>1. Character handling</p>

<p>2. Collating</p>

<p>3. Date/time formatting</p>

<p>4. Numeric editing</p>

<p>5. Monetary formatting</p>

<p>6. Messaging</p>

<p>The setlocale() function provides the application
developer with the ability to set all or portions, called
categories, of the international environment. These
categories correspond to the areas of functionality
mentioned above. The syntax for setlocale() is as
follows:</p>

<p>char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale);</p>

<p>where category is the name of one of following
categories, namely:</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES</p>

<p>LC_MONETARY</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p>LC_TIME</p>

<p>In addition, a special value called LC_ALL directs
setlocale() to set all categories.</p>

<p>There are two primary uses of setlocale():</p>

<p>1. Querying the international environment to find out
what it is set to</p>

<p>2. Setting the international environment, or locale, to
a specific value</p>

<p>The behavior of setlocale() in these two areas is
described below. Since it is difficult to describe the
behavior in words, examples are used to illustrate the
behavior of specific uses.</p>

<p>To query the international environment, setlocale() is
invoked with a specific category and the NULL pointer as the
locale. The NULL pointer is a special directive to
setlocale() that tells it to query rather than set the
international environment. The following syntax is used to
query the name of the international environment:</p>

<p>setlocale({LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES,
LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME},(char *) NULL);</p>

<p>The setlocale() function shall return the string
corresponding to the current international environment. This
value may be used by a subse- quent call to setlocale() to
reset the international environment to this value. However,
it should be noted that the return value from setlocale()
may be a pointer to a static area within the function and is
not guaranteed to remain unchanged (that is, it may be
modified by a subsequent call to setlocale()). Therefore, if
the purpose of calling setlocale() is to save the value of
the current international environ- ment so it can be changed
and reset later, the return value should be copied to an
array of char in the calling program.</p>

<p>There are three ways to set the international
environment with setlo- cale():</p>

<p>setlocale(category, string)</p>

<p>This usage sets a specific category in the international
envi- ronment to a specific value corresponding to the value
of the string. A specific example is provided below:</p>

<p>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;fr_FR.ISO-8859-1&quot;);</p>

<p>In this example, all categories of the international
environment are set to the locale corresponding to the
string &quot;fr_FR.ISO-8859-1&quot;, or to the French
language as spoken in France using the ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998
standard codeset.</p>

<p>If the string does not correspond to a valid locale,
setlocale() shall return a NULL pointer and the
international environment is not changed. Otherwise,
setlocale() shall return the name of the locale just
set.</p>

<p>setlocale(category, &quot;C&quot;)</p>

<p>The ISO C standard states that one locale must exist on
all con- forming implementations. The name of the locale is
C and corre- sponds to a minimal international environment
needed to support the C programming language.</p>

<p>setlocale(category, &quot;&quot;)</p>

<p>This sets a specific category to an
implementation-defined default. This corresponds to the
value of the environment vari- ables.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
