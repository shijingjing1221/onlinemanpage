DEV_QUEUE_XMIT(9)</p>

<p>NAME dev_queue_xmit - transmit a buffer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int dev_queue_xmit(struct sk_buff * skb);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS skb buffer to transmit</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Queue a buffer for transmission to a network
device. The caller must have set the device and priority and
built the buffer before calling this function. The function
can be called from an interrupt.</p>

<p>A negative errno code is returned on a failure. A
success does not guarantee the frame will be transmitted as
it may be dropped due to congestion or traffic shaping.</p>


<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I notice this method can also return errors from the queue
disciplines, including NET_XMIT_DROP, which is a positive
value. So, errors can also be positive.</p>

<p>Regardless of the return value, the skb is consumed, so
it is currently difficult to retry a send to this method.
(You can bump the ref count before sending to hold a
reference for retry if you are careful.)</p>

<p>When calling this method, interrupts MUST be enabled.
This is because the BH enable code must have IRQs enabled so
that it will not deadlock. --BLG</p>
