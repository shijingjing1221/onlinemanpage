<p>MRTG-LOGFILE(1) mrtg MRTG-LOGFILE(1)</p>

<p>NAME mrtg-logfile - description of the mrtg-2 logfile
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS This document provides a description of the
contents of the mrtg-2 log- file.</p>

<p>OVERVIEW The logfile consists of two main sections.</p>

<p>The first Line It stores the traffic counters from the
most recent run of mrtg.</p>

<p>The rest of the File Stores past traffic rate averates
and maxima at increassing inter- vals.</p>

<p>The first number on each line is a unix time stamp. It
represents the number of seconds since 1970.</p>

<p>DETAILS The first Line</p>

<p>The first line has 3 numbers which are:</p>

<p>A (1st column) A timestamp of when MRTG last ran for
this interface. The times- tamp is the number of non-skip
seconds passed since the standard UNIX &quot;epoch&quot; of
midnight on 1st of January 1970 GMT.</p>

<p>B (2nd column) The &quot;incoming bytes counter&quot;
value.</p>

<p>C (3rd column) The &quot;outgoing bytes counter&quot;
value.</p>

<p>The rest of the File</p>

<p>The second and remaining lines of the file contains 5
numbers which are:</p>

<p>A (1st column) The Unix timestamp for the point in time
the data on this line is relevant. Note that the interval
between timestamps increases as you prograss through the
file. At first it is 5 minutes and at the end it is one day
between two lines.</p>

<p>This timestamp may be converted in OpenOffice Calc or MS
Excel by using the following formula</p>

<p>=(x+y)/86400+DATE(1970;1;1)</p>

<p>(instead of &quot;;&quot; it may be that you have to use
&quot;,&quot; this depends on the context and your locale
settings)</p>

<p>you can also ask perl to help by typing</p>

<p>perl -e print scalar localtime(x),&quot;0</p>

<p>x is the unix timestamp and y is the offset in seconds
from UTC. (Perl knows y).</p>

<p>B (2nd column) The average incoming transfer rate in
bytes per second. This is valid for the time between the A
value of the current line and the A value of the previous
line.</p>

<p>C (3rd column) The average outgoing transfer rate in
bytes per second since the previous measurement.</p>

<p>D (4th column) The maximum incoming transfer rate in
bytes per second for the cur- rent interval. This is
calculated from all the updates which have occured in the
current interval. If the current interval is 1 hour, and
updates have occured every 5 minutes, it will be the biggest
5 minute transfer rate seen during the hour.</p>

<p>E (5th column) The maximum outgoing transfer rate in
bytes per second for the cur- rent interval.</p>
