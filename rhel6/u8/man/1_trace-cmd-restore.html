<p>TRACE-CMD-RESTORE(1) [FIXME: manual]
TRACE-CMD-RESTORE(1)</p>

<p>NAME trace-cmd-restore - restore a failed trace
record</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS trace-cmd restore [OPTIONS] [command] cpu-file
[cpu-file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The trace-cmd(1) restore command will
restore a crashed trace-cmd-record(1) file. If for some
reason a trace-cmd record fails, it will leave a the per-cpu
data files and not create the final trace.dat file. The
trace-cmd restore will append the files to create a working
trace.dat file that can be read with
trace-cmd-report(1).</p>

<p>When trace-cmd record runs, it spawns off a process per
CPU and writes to a per cpu file usually called
trace.dat.cpuX, where X represents the CPU number that it is
tracing. If the -o option was used in the trace-cmd record,
then the CPU data files will have that name instead of the
trace.dat name. If a unexpected crash occurs before the
tracing is finished, then the per CPU files will still exist
but there will not be any trace.dat file to read from.
trace-cmd restore will allow you to create a trace.dat file
with the existing data files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Create a partial trace.dat file from the
machine, to be used with a full trace-cmd restore at another
time. This option is useful for embedded devices. If a
server contains the cpu files of a crashed trace-cmd record
(or trace-cmd listen), trace-cmd restore can be executed on
the embedded device with the -c option to get all the stored
information of that embedded device. Then the file created
could be copied to the server to run the trace-cmd restore
there with the cpu files.</p>

<p>If *-o* is not specified, then the file created will be
called &acute;trace-partial.dat&acute;. This is because the
file is not a full version of something that
trace-cmd-report(1) could use.</p>

<p>-t tracing_dir Used with -c, it overrides the location
to read the events from. By default, tracing information is
read from the debugfs/tracing directory. -t will use that
location instead. This can be useful if the trace.dat file
to create is from another machine. Just tar -cvf events.tar
debugfs/tracing and copy and untar that file locally, and
use that directory instead.</p>

<p>-k kallsyms Used with -c, it overrides where to read the
kallsyms file from. By default, /proc/kallsyms is used. -k
will override the file to read the kallsyms from. This can
be useful if the trace.dat file to create is from another
machine. Just copy the /proc/kallsyms file locally, and use
-k to point to that file.</p>

<p>-o output&acute; By default, trace-cmd restore will
create a trace.dat file (or trace-partial.dat if -c is
specified). You can specify a different file to write to
with the -o option.</p>

<p>-i input By default, trace-cmd restore will read the
information of the current system to create the initial data
stored in the trace.dat file. If the crash was on another
machine, then that machine should have the trace-cmd restore
run with the -c option to create the trace.dat partial file.
Then that file can be copied to the current machine where
trace-cmd restore will use -i to load that file instead of
reading from the current system.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If a crash happened on another box, you could
run:</p>

<p>$ trace-cmd restore -c -o box-partial.dat</p>

<p>Then on the server that has the cpu files:</p>

<p>$ trace-cmd restore -i box-partial.dat trace.dat.cpu0
trace.dat.cpu1</p>

<p>This would create a trace.dat file for the embedded
box.</p>
