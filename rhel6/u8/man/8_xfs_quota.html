<p>NAME xfs_quota - manage use of quota on XFS
filesystems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_quota [ -x ] [ -p prog ] [ -c cmd ] ... [
-d project ] ... [ path ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_quota is a utility for reporting and
editing various aspects of filesystem quota.</p>

<p>The options to xfs_quota are:</p>

<p>-c cmd xfs_quota commands may be run interactively (the
default) or as arguments on the command line. Multiple -c
arguments may be given. The commands are run in the sequence
given, then the program exits.</p>

<p>-p prog Set the program name for prompts and some error
messages, the default value is xfs_quota.</p>

<p>-x Enable expert mode. All of the administrative
commands (see the ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS section below)
which allow modifi- cations to the quota system are
available only in expert mode.</p>

<p>-d project Project names or numeric identifiers may be
specified with this option, which restricts the output of
the individual xfs_quota commands to the set of projects
specified. Multiple -d arguments may be given.</p>

<p>The optional path argument(s) can be used to specify
mount points or device files which identify XFS filesystems.
The output of the individ- ual xfs_quota commands will then
be restricted to the set of filesys- tems specified.</p>

<p>This manual page is divided into two sections - firstly,
information for users of filesystems with quota enabled, and
the xfs_quota commands of interest to such users; and then
information which is useful only to administrators of XFS
filesystems using quota and the quota commands which allow
modifications to the quota system.</p>

<p>Note that common to almost all of the individual
commands described below are the options for specifying
which quota types are of interest - user quota (-u), group
quota (-g), and/or project quota (-p). Also, several
commands provide options to operate on &quot;blocks
used&quot; (-b), &quot;inodes used&quot; (-i), and/or
&quot;realtime blocks used&quot; (-r).</p>

<p>Many commands also have extensive online help. Use the
help command for more details on any command.</p>

<p>QUOTA OVERVIEW In most computing environments, disk
space is not infinite. The quota subsystem provides a
mechanism to control usage of disk space. Quotas can be set
for each individual user on any/all of the local filesys-
tems. The quota subsystem warns users when they exceed their
allotted limit, but allows some extra space for current work
(hard limit/soft limit). In addition, XFS filesystems with
limit enforcement turned off can be used as an effective
disk usage accounting system.</p>

<p>UsersView of Disk Quotas To most users, disk quotas are
either of no concern or a fact of life that cannot be
avoided. There are two possible quotas that can be imposed -
a limit can be set on the amount of space a user can occupy,
and there may be a limit on the number of files (inodes) he
can own.</p>

<p>The quota command provides information on the quotas
that have been set by the system administrators and current
usage.</p>

<p>There are four numbers for each limit: current usage,
soft limit (quota), hard limit, and time limit. The soft
limit is the number of 1K-blocks (or files) that the user is
expected to remain below. The hard limit cannot be exceeded.
If a user s usage reaches the hard limit, further requests
for space (or attempts to create a file) fail with the
&quot;Quota exceeded&quot; (EDQUOT) error.</p>

<p>When a user exceeds the soft limit, the timer is
enabled. Any time the quota drops below the soft limits, the
timer is disabled. If the timer pops, the particular limit
that has been exceeded is treated as if the hard limit has
been reached, and no more resources are allocated to the
user. The only way to reset this condition, short of turning
off limit enforcement or increasing the limit, is to reduce
usage below quota. Only the superuser (i.e. a sufficiently
capable process) can set the time limits and this is done on
a per filesystem basis.</p>

<p>Surviving When the Quota Limit Is Reached In most cases,
the only way for a user to recover from over-quota con-
ditions is to abort whatever activity is in progress on the
filesystem that has reached its limit, remove sufficient
files to bring the limit back below quota, and retry the
failed program. However, if a user is in the editor and a
write fails because of an over quota situation, that is not
a suitable course of action. It is most likely that
initially attempting to write the file has truncated its
previous contents, so if the editor is aborted without
correctly writing the file, not only are the recent changes
lost, but possibly much, or even all, of the contents that
previously existed. There are several possible safe exits
for a user caught in this situa- tion. He can use the editor
shell escape command to examine his file space and remove
surplus files. Alternatively, using sh(1), he can suspend
the editor, remove some files, then resume it. A third
possi- bility is to write the file to some other filesystem
(perhaps to a file on /tmp) where the users quota has not
been exceeded. Then after rec- tifying the quota situation,
the file can be moved back to the filesys- tem it belongs
on.</p>

<p>USER COMMANDS print Lists all paths with devices/project
identifiers. The path list can come from several places -
the command line, the mount ta- ble, and the /etc/projects
file.</p>

<p>df See the free command.</p>

<p>quota [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] [ -hnNv ] [ -f file ] [ ID |
name ] ... Show individual usage and limits, for a single
user name or numeric user ID. The -h option reports in a
&quot;human-readable&quot; format similar to the df(1)
command. The -n option reports the numeric IDs rather than
the name. The -N option omits the header. The -v option
outputs verbose information. The -f option sends the output
to file instead of stdout.</p>

<p>free [ -bir ] [ -hN ] [ -f file ] Reports filesystem
usage, much like the df(1) utility. It can show usage for
blocks, inode, and/or realtime block space, and shows used,
free, and total available. If project quota are in use (see
the DIRECTORY TREE QUOTA section below), it will also report
utilisation for those projects (directory trees). The -h
option reports in a &quot;human-readable&quot; format. The
-N option omits the header. The -f option outputs the report
to file instead of stdout.</p>

<p>help [ command ] Online help for all commands, or one
specific command.</p>

<p>quit Exit xfs_quota.</p>

<p>q See the quit command.</p>

<p>QUOTA ADMINISTRATION The XFS quota system differs to
that of other filesystems in a number of ways. Most
importantly, XFS considers quota information as filesys- tem
metadata and uses journaling to provide a higher level
guarantee of consistency. As such, it is administered
differently, in particular:</p>

<p>1. The quotacheck command has no effect on XFS
filesystems. The first time quota accounting is turned on
(at mount time), XFS does an automatic quotacheck
internally; afterwards, the quota system will always be
completely consistent until quotas are manually turned
off.</p>

<p>2. There is no need for quota file(s) in the root of the
XFS filesystem.</p>

<p>3. XFS distinguishes between quota accounting and limit
enforce- ment. Quota accounting must be turned on at the
time of mount- ing the XFS filesystem. However, it is
possible to turn on/off limit enforcement any time quota
accounting is turned on. The &quot;quota&quot; option to the
mount command turns on both (user) quota accounting and
enforcement. The &quot;uqnoenforce&quot; option must be used
to turn on user accounting with limit enforcement
disabled.</p>

<p>4. Turning on quotas on the root filesystem is slightly
different from the above. For IRIX XFS, refer to
quotaon(1M). For Linux XFS, the quota mount flags must be
passed in with the &quot;root- flags=&quot; boot
parameter.</p>

<p>5. It is useful to use the state to monitor the XFS
quota subsystem at various stages - it can be used to see if
quotas are turned on, and also to monitor the space occupied
by the quota system itself..</p>

<p>6. There is a mechanism built into xfsdump that allows
quota limit information to be backed up for later
restoration, should the need arise.</p>

<p>7. Quota limits cannot be set before turning on quotas
on.</p>

<p>8. XFS filesystems keep quota accounting on the
superuser (user ID zero), and the tool will display the
superuser s usage informa- tion. However, limits are never
enforced on the superuser (nor are they enforced for group
and project ID zero).</p>

<p>9. XFS filesystems perform quota accounting whether the
user has quota limits or not.</p>

<p>10. XFS supports the notion of project quota, which can
be used to implement a form of directory tree quota (i.e. to
restrict a directory tree to only being able to use up a
component of the filesystems available space; or simply to
keep track of the amount of space used, or number of inodes,
within the tree).</p>

<p>ADMINISTRATOR COMMANDS path [ N ] Lists all paths with
devices/project identifiers or set the cur- rent path to the
Nth list entry (the current path is used by many of the
commands described here, it identifies the filesys- tem
toward which a command is directed). The patch list can come
from several places - the command line, the mount table, and
the /etc/projects file.</p>

<p>report [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] [ -ahntLNU ] [ -f file ] Report
filesystem quota information. This reports all quota usage
for a filesystem, for the specified quota type (u/g/p and/or
blocks/inodes/realtime). It reports blocks in 1KB units by
default. The -h option reports in a
&quot;human-readable&quot; format similar to the df(1)
command. The -f option outputs the report to file instead of
stdout. The -a option reports on all filesys- tems. The -n
option outputs the numeric ID instead of the name. The -L
and -U options specify lower and upper ID bounds to report
on. The -N option reports information without the header
line. The -t option performs a terse report.</p>

<p>state [ -gpu ] [ -av ] [ -f file ] Report overall quota
state information. This reports on the state of quota
accounting, quota enforcement, and the number of extents
being used by quota metadata within the filesystem. The -f
option outputs state information to file instead of stdout.
The -a option reports state on all filesystems and not just
the current path.</p>

<p>limit [ -gpu ] bsoft=N | bhard=N | isoft=N | ihard=N |
rtbsoft=N | rtb- hard=N -d | id | name Set quota block
limits (bhard/bsoft), inode count limits (ihard/isoft)
and/or realtime block limits (rtbhard/rtbsoft). The -d
option (defaults) can be used to set the default value that
will be used, otherwise a specific user/group/project name
or numeric identifier must be specified.</p>

<p>timer [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] value Allows the quota
enforcement timeout (i.e. the amount of time allowed to pass
before the soft limits are enforced as the hard limits) to
be modified. The current timeout setting can be dis- played
using the state command. The value argument is a number of
seconds, but units of minutes, hours, days, and weeks are
also understood (as are their abbreviations m, h, d, and
w).</p>

<p>warn [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] value -d | id | name Allows the
quota warnings limit (i.e. the number of times a warning
will be send to someone over quota) to be viewed and
modified. The -d option (defaults) can be used to set the
default time that will be used, otherwise a specific
user/group/project name or numeric identifier must be
specified. NOTE: this feature is not currently
implemented.</p>

<p>enable [ -gpu ] [ -v ] Switches on quota enforcement for
the filesystem identified by the current path. This requires
the filesystem to have been mounted with quota enabled, and
for accounting to be currently active. The -v option
(verbose) displays the state after the operation has
completed.</p>

<p>disable [ -gpu ] [ -v ] Disables quota enforcement,
while leaving quota accounting active. The -v option
(verbose) displays the state after the operation has
completed.</p>

<p>off [ -gpu ] [ -v ] Permanently switches quota off for
the filesystem identified by the current path. Quota can
only be switched back on subse- quently by unmounting and
then mounting again.</p>

<p>remove [ -gpu ] [ -v ] Remove any space allocated to
quota metadata from the filesystem identified by the current
path. Quota must not be enabled on the filesystem, else this
operation will report an error.</p>

<p>dump [ -gpu ] [ -f file ] Dump out quota limit
information for backup utilities, either to standard output
(default) or to a file. This is only the lim- its, not the
usage information, of course.</p>

<p>restore [ -gpu ] [ -f file ] Restore quota limits from a
backup file. The file must be in the format produced by the
dump command.</p>

<p>quot [ -gpu ] [ -bir ] [ -acnv ] [ -f file ] Summarize
filesystem ownership, by user, group or project. This
command uses a special XFS &quot;bulkstat&quot; interface to
quickly scan an entire filesystem and report usage
information. This command can be used even when filesystem
quota are not enabled, as it is a full-filesystem scan (it
may also take a long time...). The -a option displays
information on all filesystems. The -c option displays a
histogram instead of a report. The -n option displays
numeric IDs rather than names. The -v option displays
verbose information. The -f option send the output to file
instead of stdout.</p>

<p>project [ -cCs [ -d depth ] [ -p path ] id | name ]
Without arguments, this command lists known project names
and identifiers (based on entries in the /etc/projects and
/etc/pro- jid files). The -c, -C, and -s options allow the
directory tree quota mechanism to be maintained. -d allows
to limit recursion level when processing project directories
and -p allows to spec- ify project paths at command line (
instead of /etc/projects ). All options are discussed in
detail below.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY TREE QUOTA The project quota mechanism in XFS
can be used to implement a form of directory tree quota,
where a specified directory and all of the files and
subdirectories below it (i.e. a tree) can be restricted to
using a subset of the available space in the filesystem.</p>

<p>A managed tree must be setup initially using the -s
option to the project command. The specified project name or
identifier is matched to one or more trees defined in
/etc/projects, and these trees are then recursively
descended to mark the affected inodes as being part of that
tree. This process sets an inode flag and the project
identifier on every file in the affected tree. Once this has
been done, new files created in the tree will automatically
be accounted to the tree based on their project identifier.
An attempt to create a hard link to a file in the tree will
only succeed if the project identifier matches the project
identifier for the tree. The xfs_io utility can be used to
set the project ID for an arbitrary file, but this can only
be done by a privileged user.</p>

<p>A previously setup tree can be cleared from project
quota control through use of the project -C option, which
will recursively descend the tree, clearing the affected
inodes from project quota control.</p>

<p>Finally, the project -c option can be used to check
whether a tree is setup, it reports nothing if the tree is
correct, otherwise it reports the paths of inodes which do
not have the project ID of the rest of the tree, or if the
inode flag is not set.</p>

<p>Option -d can be used to limit recursion level (-1 is
infinite, 0 is top level only, 1 is first level ... ).
Option -p adds posibility to specify project paths in
command line without a need for /etc/projects to exist. Note
that if projects file exists then it is also used.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Enabling quota enforcement on an XFS filesystem
(restrict a user to a set amount of space).</p>

<p># mount -o uquota /dev/xvm/home /home # xfs_quota -x -c
limit bsoft=500m bhard=550m tanya /home # xfs_quota -x -c
report /home</p>

<p>Enabling project quota on an XFS filesystem (restrict
files in log file directories to only using 1 gigabyte of
space).</p>

<p># mount -o prjquota /dev/xvm/var /var # echo 42:/var/log
&gt;&gt; /etc/projects # echo logfiles:42 &gt;&gt;
/etc/projid # xfs_quota -x -c project -s logfiles /var #
xfs_quota -x -c limit -p bhard=1g logfiles /var</p>

<p>Same as above without a need for configuration
files.</p>

<p># rm -f /etc/projects /etc/projid # mount -o prjquota
/dev/xvm/var /var # xfs_quota -x -c project -s -p /var/log
42 /var # xfs_quota -x -c limit -p bhard=1g 42 /var</p>

<p>CAVEATS XFS implements delayed allocation (aka.
allocate-on-flush) and this has implications for the quota
subsystem. Since quota accounting can only be done when
blocks are actually allocated, it is possible to issue
(buffered) writes into a file and not see the usage
immediately updated. Only when the data is actually written
out, either via one of the kernels flushing mechanisms, or
via a manual sync(2), will the usage reported reflect what
has actually been written.</p>

<p>In addition, the XFS allocation mechanism will always
reserve the maxi- mum amount of space required before
proceeding with an allocation. If insufficient space for
this reservation is available, due to the block quota limit
being reached for example, this may result in the alloca-
tion failing even though there is sufficient space. Quota
enforcement can thus sometimes happen in situations where
the user is under quota and the end result of some operation
would still have left the user under quota had the operation
been allowed to run its course. This additional overhead is
typically in the range of tens of blocks.</p>

<p>Both of these properties are unavoidable side effects of
the way XFS operates, so should be kept in mind when
assigning block limits.</p>

<p>BUGS Quota support for filesystems with realtime
subvolumes is not yet implemented, nor is the quota warning
mechanism (the Linux warnquota(8) tool can be used to
provide similar functionality on that platform).</p>
