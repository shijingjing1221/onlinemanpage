<p>FSEEK(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FSEEK(3)</p>

<p>NAME fgetpos, fseek, fsetpos, ftell, rewind - reposition
a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);</p>

<p>long ftell(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>void rewind(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>int fgetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *pos); int fsetpos(FILE
*stream, fpos_t *pos);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fseek() function sets the file position
indicator for the stream pointed to by stream. The new
position, measured in bytes, is obtained by adding offset
bytes to the position specified by whence. If whence is set
to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, the offset is relative
to the start of the file, the current position indicator, or
end-of-file, respectively. A successful call to the fseek()
function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream and
undoes any effects of the ungetc(3) function on the same
stream.</p>

<p>The ftell() function obtains the current value of the
file position indicator for the stream pointed to by
stream.</p>

<p>The rewind() function sets the file position indicator
for the stream pointed to by stream to the beginning of the
file. It is equivalent to:</p>

<p>(void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)</p>

<p>except that the error indicator for the stream is also
cleared (see clearerr(3)).</p>

<p>The fgetpos() and fsetpos() functions are alternate
interfaces equiva- lent to ftell() and fseek() (with whence
set to SEEK_SET), setting and storing the current value of
the file offset into or from the object referenced by pos.
On some non-Unix systems an fpos_t object may be a complex
object and these routines may be the only way to portably
repo- sition a text stream.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The rewind() function returns no value.
Upon successful completion, fgetpos(), fseek(), fsetpos()
return 0, and ftell() returns the current offset. Otherwise,
-1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF The stream specified is not a seekable
stream.</p>

<p>EINVAL The whence argument to fseek() was not SEEK_SET,
SEEK_END, or SEEK_CUR.</p>

<p>The functions fgetpos(), fseek(), fsetpos(), and ftell()
may also fail and set errno for any of the errors specified
for the routines fflush(3), fstat(2), lseek(2), and
malloc(3).</p>
