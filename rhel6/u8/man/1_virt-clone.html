<p>VIRT-CLONE(1) Virtual Machine Install Tools
VIRT-CLONE(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-clone - clone existing virtual machine
images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-clone [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-clone is a command line tool for
cloning existing virtual machine images using the
&quot;libvirt&quot; hypervisor management library. It will
copy the disk images of any existing virtual machine, and
define a new guest with an identical virtual hardware
configuration. Elements which require uniqueness will be
updated to avoid a clash between old and new guests.</p>

<p>By default, virt-clone will show an error if the
necessary information to clone the guest is not provided.
The --auto-clone option will generate all needed input,
aside from the source guest to clone. An interactive mode is
available with the --prompt option, but this will only ask
for the minimum required options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most options are not required. Minimum
requirements are --original or --original-xml (to specify
the guest to clone), --name, and appropriate storage options
via -file.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show the help message and exit</p>

<p>--connect=CONNECT Connect to a non-default hypervisor.
See virt-install(1) for details</p>

<p>General Options General configuration parameters that
apply to all guest clones.</p>

<p>-o ORIGINAL_GUEST, --original=ORIGINAL_GUEST Name of the
original guest to be cloned. This guest must be shut off or
paused since it is not possible to safely clone active
guests at this time.</p>

<p>--original-xml=ORIGINAL_XML Libvirt guest xml file to
use as the original guest. The guest does not need to be
defined on the libvirt connection. This takes the place of
the &quot;--original&quot; parameter.</p>

<p>--auto-clone Generate a new guest name, and paths for
new storage.</p>

<p>An example or possible generated output:</p>

<p>Original name : MyVM Generated clone name :
MyVM-clone</p>

<p>Original disk path : /home/user/foobar.img Generated
disk path : /home/user/foobar-clone.img</p>

<p>If generated names collide with existing VMs or storage,
a number is appended, such as foobar-clone-1.img, or
MyVM-clone-3.</p>

<p>-n NAME, --name=NAME Name of the new guest virtual
machine instance. This must be unique amongst all guests
known to the hypervisor connection, including those not
currently active.</p>

<p>-u UUID, --uuid=UUID UUID for the guest; if none is
given a random UUID will be generated. If you specify UUID,
you should use a 32-digit hexadecimal number. UUID are
intended to be unique across the entire data center, and
indeed world. Bear this in mind if manually specifying a
UUID</p>

<p>Storage Configuration -f DISKFILE, --file=DISKFILE Path
to the file, disk partition, or logical volume to use as the
backing store for the new guests virtual disk. If the
original guest has multiple disks, this parameter must be
repeated multiple times, once per disk in the original
virtual machine.</p>

<p>--force-copy=TARGET Force cloning the passed disk target
(hdc, sda, etc.). By default, &quot;virt-clone&quot; will
skip certain disks, such as those marked readonly or
shareable.</p>

<p>--nonsparse Fully allocate the new storage if the path
being cloned is a sparse file. See virt-install(1) for more
details on sparse vs. nonsparse.</p>

<p>--preserve-data No storage is cloned: disk images
specific by --file are preserved as is, and referenced in
the new clone XML. This is useful if you want to clone a VM
XML template, but not the storage contents.</p>

<p>Networking Configuration -m MAC, --mac=MAC Fixed MAC
address for the guest; If this parameter is omitted, or the
value &quot;RANDOM&quot; is specified a suitable address
will be randomly generated. Addresses are applied
sequentially to the networks as they are listed in the
original guest XML.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Options --print-xml Print the generated
clone XML and exit without cloning.</p>

<p>--replace Shutdown and remove any existing guest with
the passed &quot;--name&quot; before cloning the original
guest.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Print debugging information to the terminal
when running the install process. The debugging information
is also stored in &quot;$HOME/.virtinst/virt-clone.log&quot;
even if this parameter is omitted.</p>

<p>--force Prevent interactive prompts. If the intended
prompt was a yes/no prompt, always say yes. For any other
prompts, the application will exit.</p>

<p>--prompt Specifically enable prompting for required
information. Default prompting is off.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Clone the guest called &quot;demo&quot; on the
default connection, auto generating a new name and disk
clone path.</p>

<p># virt-clone --original demo --auto-clone</p>

<p>Clone the guest called &quot;demo&quot; which has a
single disk to copy</p>

<p># virt-clone --original demo --name newdemo --file
/var/lib/xen/images/newdemo.img</p>

<p>Clone a QEMU guest with multiple disks</p>

<p># virt-clone --connect qemu:///system --original demo
--name newdemo --file /var/lib/xen/images/newdemo.img --file
/var/lib/xen/images/newdata.img</p>

<p>Clone a guest to a physical device which is at least as
big as the original guests disks. If the destination device
is bigger, the new guest can do a filesystem resize when it
boots.</p>

<p># virt-clone --connect qemu:///system --name demo --file
/dev/HostVG/DemoVM --mac 52:54:00:34:11:54</p>
