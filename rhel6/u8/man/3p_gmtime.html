<p>GMTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GMTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME gmtime, gmtime_r - convert a time value to a
broken-down UTC time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *timer);</p>

<p>struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *restrict timer, struct
tm *restrict result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For gmtime(): The functionality described on
this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any
conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO
C standard is unintentional. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 defers to the ISO C standard.</p>

<p>The gmtime() function shall convert the time in seconds
since the Epoch pointed to by timer into a broken-down time,
expressed as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).</p>

<p>The relationship between a time in seconds since the
Epoch used as an argument to gmtime() and the tm structure
(defined in the &lt;time.h&gt; header) is that the result
shall be as specified in the expression given in the
definition of seconds since the Epoch (see the Base Defi-
nitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 4.14,
Seconds Since the Epoch), where the names in the structure
and in the expression corre- spond.</p>

<p>The same relationship shall apply for gmtime_r().</p>

<p>The gmtime() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime()
functions shall return values in one of two static objects:
a broken-down time struc- ture and an array of type char.
Execution of any of the functions may overwrite the
information returned in either of these objects by any of
the other functions.</p>

<p>The gmtime_r() function shall convert the time in
seconds since the Epoch pointed to by timer into a
broken-down time expressed as Coordi- nated Universal Time
(UTC). The broken-down time is stored in the structure
referred to by result. The gmtime_r() function shall also
return the address of the same structure.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the gmtime()
function shall return a pointer to a struct tm. If an error
is detected, gmtime() shall return a null pointer and set
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, gmtime_r() shall return the
address of the structure pointed to by the argument result.
If an error is detected, gmtime_r() shall return a null
pointer.</p>

<p>ERRORS The gmtime() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The result cannot be represented.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The gmtime_r() function is thread-safe
and returns values in a user- supplied buffer instead of
possibly using a static data area that may be overwritten by
each call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
