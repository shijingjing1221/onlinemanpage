<p>TCSH(1) TCSH(1)</p>

<p>NAME tcsh - C shell with file name completion and
command line editing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tcsh [-bcdefFimnqstvVxX] [-Dname[=value]] [arg
...] tcsh -l</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tcsh is an enhanced but completely
compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell, csh(1). It
is a command language interpreter usable both as an
interactive login shell and a shell script command
processor. It includes a command-line editor (see The
command-line editor), pro- grammable word completion (see
Completion and listing), spelling cor- rection (see Spelling
correction), a history mechanism (see History substitution),
job control (see Jobs) and a C-like syntax. The NEW FEATURES
section describes major enhancements of tcsh over csh(1).
Throughout this manual, features of tcsh not found in most
csh(1) implementations (specifically, the 4.4BSD csh) are
labeled with (+), and features which are present in csh(1)
but not usually documented are labeled with (u).</p>

<p>Argument list processing If the first argument (argument
0) to the shell is - then it is a login shell. A login shell
can be also specified by invoking the shell with the -l flag
as the only argument.</p>

<p>The rest of the flag arguments are interpreted as
follows:</p>

<p>-b Forces a break from option processing, causing any
further shell arguments to be treated as non-option
arguments. The remain- ing arguments will not be interpreted
as shell options. This may be used to pass options to a
shell script without confusion or pos- sible subterfuge. The
shell will not run a set-user ID script without this
option.</p>

<p>-c Commands are read from the following argument (which
must be present, and must be a single argument), stored in
the command shell variable for reference, and executed. Any
remaining argu- ments are placed in the argv shell
variable.</p>

<p>-d The shell loads the directory stack from ~/.cshdirs
as described under Startup and shutdown, whether or not it
is a login shell. (+)</p>

<p>-Dname[=value] Sets the environment variable name to
value. (Domain/OS only) (+)</p>

<p>-e The shell exits if any invoked command terminates
abnormally or yields a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>-f The shell does not load any resource or startup
files, or perform any command hashing, and thus starts
faster.</p>

<p>-F The shell uses fork(2) instead of vfork(2) to spawn
processes. (+)</p>

<p>-i The shell is interactive and prompts for its
top-level input, even if it appears to not be a terminal.
Shells are interactive without this option if their inputs
and outputs are terminals.</p>

<p>-l The shell is a login shell. Applicable only if -l is
the only flag specified.</p>

<p>-m The shell loads ~/.tcshrc even if it does not belong
to the effec- tive user. Newer versions of su(1) can pass -m
to the shell. (+)</p>

<p>-n The shell parses commands but does not execute them.
This aids in debugging shell scripts.</p>

<p>-q The shell accepts SIGQUIT (see Signal handling) and
behaves when it is used under a debugger. Job control is
disabled. (u)</p>

<p>-s Command input is taken from the standard input.</p>

<p>-t The shell reads and executes a single line of input.
A may be used to escape the newline at the end of this line
and continue onto another line.</p>

<p>-v Sets the verbose shell variable, so that command
input is echoed after history substitution.</p>

<p>-x Sets the echo shell variable, so that commands are
echoed immedi- ately before execution.</p>

<p>-V Sets the verbose shell variable even before executing
~/.tcshrc.</p>

<p>-X Is to -x as -V is to -v.</p>

<p>--help Print a help message on the standard output and
exit. (+)</p>

<p>--version Print the version/platform/compilation options
on the standard out- put and exit. This information is also
contained in the version shell variable. (+)</p>

<p>After processing of flag arguments, if arguments remain
but none of the -c, -i, -s, or -t options were given, the
first argument is taken as the name of a file of commands,
or script , to be executed. The shell opens this file and
saves its name for possible resubstitution by $0. Because
many systems use either the standard version 6 or ver- sion
7 shells whose shell scripts are not compatible with this
shell, the shell uses such a standard shell to execute a
script whose first character is not a #, i.e., that does not
start with a comment.</p>

<p>Remaining arguments are placed in the argv shell
variable.</p>

<p>Startup and shutdown A login shell begins by executing
commands from the system files /etc/csh.cshrc and
/etc/csh.login. It then executes commands from files in the
users home directory: first ~/.tcshrc (+) or, if ~/.tcshrc
is not found, ~/.cshrc, then ~/.history (or the value of the
histfile shell variable), then ~/.login, and finally
~/.cshdirs (or the value of the dirsfile shell variable)
(+). The shell may read /etc/csh.login before instead of
after /etc/csh.cshrc, and ~/.login before instead of after
~/.tcshrc or ~/.cshrc and ~/.history, if so compiled; see
the version shell variable. (+)</p>

<p>Non-login shells read only /etc/csh.cshrc and ~/.tcshrc
or ~/.cshrc on startup.</p>

<p>For examples of startup files, please consult
http://tcshrc.source- forge.net.</p>

<p>Commands like stty(1) and tset(1), which need be run
only once per login, usually go in ones ~/.login file. Users
who need to use the same set of files with both csh(1) and
tcsh can have only a ~/.cshrc which checks for the existence
of the tcsh shell variable (q.v.) before using tcsh-specific
commands, or can have both a ~/.cshrc and a ~/.tcshrc which
sources (see the builtin command) ~/.cshrc. The rest of this
manual uses ~/.tcshrc to mean ~/.tcshrc or, if ~/.tcshrc is
not found, ~/.cshrc.</p>

<p>In the normal case, the shell begins reading commands
from the termi- nal, prompting with &gt; . (Processing of
arguments and the use of the shell to process files
containing command scripts are described later.) The shell
repeatedly reads a line of command input, breaks it into
words, places it on the command history list, parses it and
executes each command in the line.</p>

<p>One can log out by typing ^D on an empty line, logout or
login or via the shells autologout mechanism (see the
autologout shell vari- able). When a login shell terminates
it sets the logout shell variable to normal or automatic as
appropriate, then executes commands from the files
/etc/csh.logout and ~/.logout. The shell may drop DTR on
logout if so compiled; see the version shell variable.</p>

<p>The names of the system login and logout files vary from
system to sys- tem for compatibility with different csh(1)
variants; see FILES.</p>

<p>Editing We first describe The command-line editor. The
Completion and listing and Spelling correction sections
describe two sets of functionality that are implemented as
editor commands but which deserve their own treatment.
Finally, Editor commands lists and describes the editor
commands specific to the shell and their default
bindings.</p>

<p>The command-line editor (+) Command-line input can be
edited using key sequences much like those used in GNU Emacs
or vi(1). The editor is active only when the edit shell
variable is set, which it is by default in interactive
shells. The bindkey builtin can display and change key
bindings. Emacs-style key bindings are used by default
(unless the shell was compiled other- wise; see the version
shell variable), but bindkey can change the key bindings to
vi-style bindings en masse.</p>

<p>The shell always binds the arrow keys (as defined in the
TERMCAP envi- ronment variable) to</p>

<p>down down-history up up-history left backward-char right
forward-char</p>

<p>unless doing so would alter another single-character
binding. One can set the arrow key escape sequences to the
empty string with settc to prevent these bindings. The
ANSI/VT100 sequences for arrow keys are always bound.</p>

<p>Other key bindings are, for the most part, what Emacs
and vi(1) users would expect and can easily be displayed by
bindkey, so there is no need to list them here. Likewise,
bindkey can list the editor commands with a short
description of each.</p>

<p>Note that editor commands do not have the same notion of
a word as does the shell. The editor delimits words with any
non-alphanumeric characters not in the shell variable
wordchars, while the shell recog- nizes only whitespace and
some of the characters with special meanings to it, listed
under Lexical structure.</p>

<p>Completion and listing (+) The shell is often able to
complete words when given a unique abbrevia- tion. Type part
of a word (for example ls /usr/lost) and hit the tab key to
run the complete-word editor command. The shell completes
the filename /usr/lost to /usr/lost+found/, replacing the
incomplete word with the complete word in the input buffer.
(Note the terminal / ; completion adds a / to the end of
completed directories and a space to the end of other
completed words, to speed typing and provide a visual
indicator of successful completion. The addsuffix shell
variable can be unset to prevent this.) If no match is found
(perhaps /usr/lost+found doesn t exist), the terminal bell
rings. If the word is already complete (perhaps there is a
/usr/lost on your system, or perhaps you were thinking too
far ahead and typed the whole thing) a / or space is added
to the end if it isnt already there.</p>

<p>Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the
end; completed text pushes the rest of the line to the
right. Completion in the mid- dle of a word often results in
leftover characters to the right of the cursor that need to
be deleted.</p>

<p>Commands and variables can be completed in much the same
way. For example, typing em[tab] would complete em to emacs
if emacs were the only command on your system beginning with
em. Completion can find a command in any directory in path
or if given a full pathname. Typing echo $ar[tab] would
complete $ar to $argv if no other variable began with
ar.</p>

<p>The shell parses the input buffer to determine whether
the word you want to complete should be completed as a
filename, command or vari- able. The first word in the
buffer and the first word following ;, | , |&amp;,
&amp;&amp; or || is considered to be a command. A word
begin- ning with $ is considered to be a variable. Anything
else is a file- name. An empty line is completed as a
filename.</p>

<p>You can list the possible completions of a word at any
time by typing ^D to run the delete-char-or-list-or-eof
editor command. The shell lists the possible completions
using the ls-F builtin (q.v.) and reprints the prompt and
unfinished command line, for example:</p>

<p>&gt; ls /usr/l[^D] lbin/ lib/ local/ lost+found/ &gt; ls
/usr/l</p>

<p>If the autolist shell variable is set, the shell lists
the remaining choices (if any) whenever completion
fails:</p>

<p>&gt; set autolist &gt; nm /usr/lib/libt[tab]
libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@ &gt; nm /usr/lib/libterm</p>

<p>If autolist is set to ambiguous, choices are listed only
when comple- tion fails and adds no new characters to the
word being completed.</p>

<p>A filename to be completed can contain variables, your
own or others home directories abbreviated with ~ (see
Filename substitution) and directory stack entries
abbreviated with = (see Directory stack sub- stitution). For
example,</p>

<p>&gt; ls ~k[^D] kahn kas kellogg &gt; ls ~ke[tab] &gt; ls
~kellogg/</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&gt; set local = /usr/local &gt; ls $lo[tab] &gt; ls
$local/[^D] bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/ &gt; ls $local/</p>

<p>Note that variables can also be expanded explicitly with
the expand- variables editor command.</p>

<p>delete-char-or-list-or-eof lists at only the end of the
line; in the middle of a line it deletes the character under
the cursor and on an empty line it logs one out or, if
ignoreeof is set, does nothing. M-^D , bound to the editor
command list-choices, lists completion pos- sibilities
anywhere on a line, and list-choices (or any one of the
related editor commands that do or dont delete, list and/or
log out, listed under delete-char-or-list-or-eof) can be
bound to ^D with the bindkey builtin command if so
desired.</p>

<p>The complete-word-fwd and complete-word-back editor
commands (not bound to any keys by default) can be used to
cycle up and down through the list of possible completions,
replacing the current word with the next or previous word in
the list.</p>

<p>The shell variable fignore can be set to a list of
suffixes to be ignored by completion. Consider the
following:</p>

<p>&gt; ls Makefile condiments.h~ main.o side.c README
main.c meal side.o condiments.h main.c~ &gt; set fignore =
(.o ) &gt; emacs ma[^D] main.c main.c~ main.o &gt; emacs
ma[tab] &gt; emacs main.c</p>

<p>main.c~ and main.o are ignored by completion (but not
listing), because they end in suffixes in fignore. Note that
a was needed in front of ~ to prevent it from being expanded
to home as described under Filename substitution. fignore is
ignored if only one completion is possible.</p>

<p>If the complete shell variable is set to enhance,
completion 1) ignores case and 2) considers periods, hyphens
and underscores (., - and _ ) to be word separators and
hyphens and underscores to be equivalent. If you had the
following files</p>

<p>comp.lang.c comp.lang.perl comp.std.c++ comp.lang.c++
comp.std.c</p>

<p>and typed mail -f c.l.c[tab], it would be completed to
mail -f comp.lang.c , and ^D would list comp.lang.c and
comp.lang.c++. mail -f c..c++[^D] would list comp.lang.c++
and comp.std.c++. Typing rm a--file[^D] in the following
directory</p>

<p>A_silly_file a-hyphenated-file another_silly_file</p>

<p>would list all three files, because case is ignored and
hyphens and underscores are equivalent. Periods, however,
are not equivalent to hyphens or underscores.</p>

<p>Completion and listing are affected by several other
shell variables: recexact can be set to complete on the
shortest possible unique match, even if more typing might
result in a longer match:</p>

<p>&gt; ls fodder foo food foonly &gt; set recexact &gt; rm
fo[tab]</p>

<p>just beeps, because fo could expand to fod or foo, but
if we type another o,</p>

<p>&gt; rm foo[tab] &gt; rm foo</p>

<p>the completion completes on foo, even though food and
foonly also match. autoexpand can be set to run the
expand-history editor command before each completion
attempt, autocorrect can be set to spelling-cor- rect the
word to be completed (see Spelling correction) before each
completion attempt and correct can be set to complete
commands automat- ically after one hits return. matchbeep
can be set to make comple- tion beep or not beep in a
variety of situations, and nobeep can be set to never beep
at all. nostat can be set to a list of directories and/or
patterns that match directories to prevent the completion
mecha- nism from stat(2)ing those directories. listmax and
listmaxrows can be set to limit the number of items and rows
(respectively) that are listed without asking first.
recognize_only_executables can be set to make the shell list
only executables when listing commands, but it is quite
slow.</p>

<p>Finally, the complete builtin command can be used to
tell the shell how to complete words other than filenames,
commands and variables. Com- pletion and listing do not work
on glob-patterns (see Filename substi- tution), but the
list-glob and expand-glob editor commands perform equivalent
functions for glob-patterns.</p>

<p>Spelling correction (+) The shell can sometimes correct
the spelling of filenames, commands and variable names as
well as completing and listing them.</p>

<p>Individual words can be spelling-corrected with the
spell-word editor command (usually bound to M-s and M-S) and
the entire input buffer with spell-line (usually bound to
M-$). The correct shell variable can be set to cmd to
correct the command name or all to correct the entire line
each time return is typed, and autocorrect can be set to
correct the word to be completed before each completion
attempt.</p>

<p>When spelling correction is invoked in any of these ways
and the shell thinks that any part of the command line is
misspelled, it prompts with the corrected line:</p>

<p>&gt; set correct = cmd &gt; lz /usr/bin CORRECT&gt;ls
/usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?</p>

<p>One can answer y or space to execute the corrected line,
e to leave the uncorrected command in the input buffer, a to
abort the command as if ^C had been hit, and anything else
to execute the original line unchanged.</p>

<p>Spelling correction recognizes user-defined completions
(see the com- plete builtin command). If an input word in a
position for which a completion is defined resembles a word
in the completion list, spelling correction registers a
misspelling and suggests the latter word as a correction.
However, if the input word does not match any of the pos-
sible completions for that position, spelling correction
does not reg- ister a misspelling.</p>

<p>Like completion, spelling correction works anywhere in
the line, push- ing the rest of the line to the right and
possibly leaving extra char- acters to the right of the
cursor.</p>

<p>Beware: spelling correction is not guaranteed to work
the way one intends, and is provided mostly as an
experimental feature. Sugges- tions and improvements are
welcome.</p>

<p>Editor commands (+) bindkey lists key bindings and
bindkey -l lists and briefly describes editor commands. Only
new or especially interesting editor commands are described
here. See emacs(1) and vi(1) for descriptions of each
editors key bindings.</p>

<p>The character or characters to which each command is
bound by default is given in parentheses. ^character means a
control character and M-character a meta character, typed as
escape-character on terminals without a meta key. Case
counts, but commands that are bound to let- ters by default
are bound to both lower- and uppercase letters for con-
venience.</p>

<p>complete-word (tab) Completes a word as described under
Completion and listing.</p>

<p>complete-word-back (not bound) Like complete-word-fwd,
but steps up from the end of the list.</p>

<p>complete-word-fwd (not bound) Replaces the current word
with the first word in the list of possible completions. May
be repeated to step down through the list. At the end of the
list, beeps and reverts to the incom- plete word.</p>

<p>complete-word-raw (^X-tab) Like complete-word, but
ignores user-defined completions.</p>

<p>copy-prev-word (M-^_) Copies the previous word in the
current line into the input buffer. See also
insert-last-word.</p>

<p>dabbrev-expand (M-/) Expands the current word to the
most recent preceding one for which the current is a leading
substring, wrapping around the history list (once) if
necessary. Repeating dabbrev-expand without any intervening
typing changes to the next previous word etc., skipping
identical matches much like history-search- backward
does.</p>

<p>delete-char (not bound) Deletes the character under the
cursor. See also delete-char- or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p>delete-char-or-eof (not bound) Does delete-char if there
is a character under the cursor or end-of-file on an empty
line. See also delete-char-or-list-or- eof.</p>

<p>delete-char-or-list (not bound) Does delete-char if
there is a character under the cursor or list-choices at the
end of the line. See also delete-char-or- list-or-eof.</p>

<p>delete-char-or-list-or-eof (^D) Does delete-char if
there is a character under the cursor, list-choices at the
end of the line or end-of-file on an empty line. See also
those three commands, each of which does only a single
action, and delete-char-or-eof, delete-char-or-list and
list-or-eof, each of which does a different two out of the
three.</p>

<p>down-history (down-arrow, ^N) Like up-history, but steps
down, stopping at the original input line.</p>

<p>end-of-file (not bound) Signals an end of file, causing
the shell to exit unless the ignoreeof shell variable (q.v.)
is set to prevent this. See also
delete-char-or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p>expand-history (M-space) Expands history substitutions
in the current word. See History substitution. See also
magic-space, toggle-literal-history and the autoexpand shell
variable.</p>

<p>expand-glob (^X-*) Expands the glob-pattern to the left
of the cursor. See File- name substitution.</p>

<p>expand-line (not bound) Like expand-history, but expands
history substitutions in each word in the input buffer,</p>

<p>expand-variables (^X-$) Expands the variable to the left
of the cursor. See Variable substitution.</p>

<p>history-search-backward (M-p, M-P) Searches backwards
through the history list for a command beginning with the
current contents of the input buffer up to the cursor and
copies it into the input buffer. The search string may be a
glob-pattern (see Filename substitution) con- taining * , ?
, [] or {}. up-history and down-history will proceed from
the appropriate point in the history list. Emacs mode only.
See also history-search-forward and i-search- back.</p>

<p>history-search-forward (M-n, M-N) Like
history-search-backward, but searches forward.</p>

<p>i-search-back (not bound) Searches backward like
history-search-backward, copies the first match into the
input buffer with the cursor positioned at the end of the
pattern, and prompts with bck: and the first match.
Additional characters may be typed to extend the search,
i-search-back may be typed to continue searching with the
same pattern, wrapping around the history list if neces-
sary, (i-search-back must be bound to a single character for
this to work) or one of the following special characters may
be typed:</p>

<p>^W Appends the rest of the word under the cursor to the
search pattern. delete (or any character bound to
backward-delete-char) Undoes the effect of the last
character typed and deletes a character from the search
pattern if appropriate. ^G If the previous search was
successful, aborts the entire search. If not, goes back to
the last suc- cessful search. escape Ends the search,
leaving the current line in the input buffer.</p>

<p>Any other character not bound to self-insert-command
terminates the search, leaving the current line in the input
buffer, and is then interpreted as normal input. In
particular, a carriage return causes the current line to be
executed. Emacs mode only. See also i-search-fwd and
history-search-backward.</p>

<p>i-search-fwd (not bound) Like i-search-back, but
searches forward.</p>

<p>insert-last-word (M-_) Inserts the last word of the
previous input line (!$) into the input buffer. See also
copy-prev-word.</p>

<p>list-choices (M-^D) Lists completion possibilities as
described under Completion and listing. See also
delete-char-or-list-or-eof and list- choices-raw.</p>

<p>list-choices-raw (^X-^D) Like list-choices, but ignores
user-defined completions.</p>

<p>list-glob (^X-g, ^X-G) Lists (via the ls-F builtin)
matches to the glob-pattern (see Filename substitution) to
the left of the cursor.</p>

<p>list-or-eof (not bound) Does list-choices or end-of-file
on an empty line. See also delete-char-or-list-or-eof.</p>

<p>magic-space (not bound) Expands history substitutions in
the current line, like expand- history, and inserts a space.
magic-space is designed to be bound to the space bar, but is
not bound by default.</p>

<p>normalize-command (^X-?) Searches for the current word
in PATH and, if it is found, replaces it with the full path
to the executable. Special characters are quoted. Aliases
are expanded and quoted but commands within aliases are not.
This command is useful with commands that take commands as
arguments, e.g., dbx and sh -x.</p>

<p>normalize-path (^X-n, ^X-N) Expands the current word as
described under the expand set- ting of the symlinks shell
variable.</p>

<p>overwrite-mode (unbound) Toggles between input and
overwrite modes.</p>

<p>run-fg-editor (M-^Z) Saves the current input line and
looks for a stopped job with a name equal to the last
component of the file name part of the EDITOR or VISUAL
environment variables, or, if neither is set, ed or vi. If
such a job is found, it is restarted as if fg %job had been
typed. This is used to toggle back and forth between an
editor and the shell easily. Some people bind this command
to ^Z so they can do this even more easily.</p>

<p>run-help (M-h, M-H) Searches for documentation on the
current command, using the same notion of current command as
the completion routines, and prints it. There is no way to
use a pager; run-help is designed for short help files. If
the special alias helpcom- mand is defined, it is run with
the command name as a sole argument. Else, documentation
should be in a file named com- mand.help, command.1,
command.6, command.8 or command, which should be in one of
the directories listed in the HPATH envi- ronment variable.
If there is more than one help file only the first is
printed.</p>

<p>self-insert-command (text characters) In insert mode
(the default), inserts the typed character into the input
line after the character under the cursor. In over- write
mode, replaces the character under the cursor with the typed
character. The input mode is normally preserved between
lines, but the inputmode shell variable can be set to insert
or overwrite to put the editor in that mode at the beginning
of each line. See also overwrite-mode.</p>

<p>sequence-lead-in (arrow prefix, meta prefix, ^X)
Indicates that the following characters are part of a
multi-key sequence. Binding a command to a multi-key
sequence really creates two bindings: the first character to
sequence-lead-in and the whole sequence to the command. All
sequences beginning with a character bound to
sequence-lead-in are effectively bound to undefined-key
unless bound to another command.</p>

<p>spell-line (M-$) Attempts to correct the spelling of
each word in the input buffer, like spell-word, but ignores
words whose first charac- ter is one of -, !, ^ or %, or
which contain , * or ? , to avoid problems with switches,
substitutions and the like. See Spelling correction.</p>

<p>spell-word (M-s, M-S) Attempts to correct the spelling
of the current word as described under Spelling correction.
Checks each component of a word which appears to be a
pathname.</p>

<p>toggle-literal-history (M-r, M-R) Expands or unexpands
history substitutions in the input buffer. See also
expand-history and the autoexpand shell vari- able.</p>

<p>undefined-key (any unbound key) Beeps.</p>

<p>up-history (up-arrow, ^P) Copies the previous entry in
the history list into the input buffer. If histlit is set,
uses the literal form of the entry. May be repeated to step
up through the history list, stopping at the top.</p>

<p>vi-search-back (?) Prompts with ? for a search string
(which may be a glob-pat- tern, as with
history-search-backward), searches for it and copies it into
the input buffer. The bell rings if no match is found.
Hitting return ends the search and leaves the last match in
the input buffer. Hitting escape ends the search and
executes the match. vi mode only.</p>

<p>vi-search-fwd (/) Like vi-search-back, but searches
forward.</p>

<p>which-command (M-?) Does a which (see the description of
the builtin command) on the first word of the input
buffer.</p>

<p>yank-pop (M-y) When executed immediately after a yank or
another yank-pop, replaces the yanked string with the next
previous string from the killring. This also has the effect
of rotating the kill- ring, such that this string will be
considered the most recently killed by a later yank command.
Repeating yank-pop will cycle through the killring any
number of times.</p>

<p>Lexical structure The shell splits input lines into
words at blanks and tabs. The spe- cial characters &amp;, |,
;, &lt;, &gt;, (, and ) and the doubled characters
&amp;&amp; , ||, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are always separate
words, whether or not they are surrounded by whitespace.</p>

<p>When the shells input is not a terminal, the character #
is taken to begin a comment. Each # and the rest of the
input line on which it appears is discarded before further
parsing.</p>

<p>A special character (including a blank or tab) may be
prevented from having its special meaning, and possibly made
part of another word, by preceding it with a backslash () or
enclosing it in single (), double ( &quot; ) or backward ()
quotes. When not otherwise quoted a newline preceded by a is
equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes this sequence
results in a newline.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all Substitutions (see below) except
History substitution can be prevented by enclosing the
strings (or parts of strings) in which they appear with
single quotes or by quoting the crucial charac- ter(s)
(e.g., $ or for Variable substitution or Command substitu-
tion respectively) with . (Alias substitution is no
exception: quoting in any way any character of a word for
which an alias has been defined prevents substitution of the
alias. The usual way of quoting an alias is to precede it
with a backslash.) History substitution is prevented by
backslashes but not by single quotes. Strings quoted with
double or backward quotes undergo Variable substitution and
Command substitution, but other substitutions are
prevented.</p>

<p>Text inside single or double quotes becomes a single
word (or part of one). Metacharacters in these strings,
including blanks and tabs, do not form separate words. Only
in one special case (see Command substi- tution below) can a
double-quoted string yield parts of more than one word;
single-quoted strings never do. Backward quotes are special:
they signal Command substitution (q.v.), which may result in
more than one word.</p>

<p>Quoting complex strings, particularly strings which
themselves contain quoting characters, can be confusing.
Remember that quotes need not be used as they are in human
writing! It may be easier to quote not an entire string, but
only those parts of the string which need quoting, using
different types of quoting to do so if appropriate.</p>

<p>The backslash_quote shell variable (q.v.) can be set to
make back- slashes always quote , , and &quot;. (+) This may
make complex quoting tasks easier, but it can cause syntax
errors in csh(1) scripts.</p>

<p>Substitutions We now describe the various
transformations the shell performs on the input in the order
in which they occur. We note in passing the data structures
involved and the commands and variables which affect them.
Remember that substitutions can be prevented by quoting as
described under Lexical structure.</p>

<p>History substitution Each command, or event, input from
the terminal is saved in the history list. The previous
command is always saved, and the history shell variable can
be set to a number to save that many commands. The histdup
shell variable can be set to not save duplicate events or
con- secutive duplicate events.</p>

<p>Saved commands are numbered sequentially from 1 and
stamped with the time. It is not usually necessary to use
event numbers, but the cur- rent event number can be made
part of the prompt by placing an ! in the prompt shell
variable.</p>

<p>The shell actually saves history in expanded and literal
(unexpanded) forms. If the histlit shell variable is set,
commands that display and store history use the literal
form.</p>

<p>The history builtin command can print, store in a file,
restore and clear the history list at any time, and the
savehist and histfile shell variables can be can be set to
store the history list automatically on logout and restore
it on login.</p>

<p>History substitutions introduce words from the history
list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat
commands, repeat arguments of a previous command in the
current command, or fix spelling mistakes in the previous
command with little typing and a high degree of confi-
dence.</p>

<p>History substitutions begin with the character !. They
may begin anywhere in the input stream, but they do not
nest. The ! may be preceded by a to prevent its special
meaning; for convenience, a ! is passed unchanged when it is
followed by a blank, tab, newline, = or (. History
substitutions also occur when an input line begins with ^.
This special abbreviation will be described later. The
characters used to signal history substitution (! and ^) can
be changed by setting the histchars shell variable. Any
input line which contains a history substitution is printed
before it is executed.</p>

<p>A history substitution may have an event specification ,
which indi- cates the event from which words are to be
taken, a word designa- tor, which selects particular words
from the chosen event, and/or a modifier, which manipulates
the selected words.</p>

<p>An event specification can be</p>

<p>n A number, referring to a particular event -n An
offset, referring to the event n before the current event #
The current event. This should be used carefully in csh(1),
where there is no check for recursion. tcsh allows 10 levels
of recursion. (+) ! The previous event (equivalent to -1) s
The most recent event whose first word begins with the
string s ?s? The most recent event which contains the string
s. The second ? can be omitted if it is immediately followed
by a newline.</p>

<p>For example, consider this bit of someones history
list:</p>

<p>9 8:30 nroff -man wumpus.man 10 8:31 cp wumpus.man
wumpus.man.old 11 8:36 vi wumpus.man 12 8:37 diff
wumpus.man.old wumpus.man</p>

<p>The commands are shown with their event numbers and time
stamps. The current event, which we havent typed in yet, is
event 13. !11 and !-2 refer to event 11. !! refers to the
previous event, 12. !! can be abbreviated ! if it is
followed by : ( : is described below). !n refers to event 9,
which begins with n. !?old? also refers to event 12, which
contains old . Without word designators or modifiers history
references simply expand to the entire event, so we might
type !cp to redo the copy command or !!|more if the diff
output scrolled off the top of the screen.</p>

<p>History references may be insulated from the surrounding
text with braces if necessary. For example, !vdoc would look
for a command beginning with vdoc, and, in this example, not
find one, but !{v}doc would expand unambiguously to vi
wumpus.mandoc. Even in braces, history substitutions do not
nest.</p>

<p>(+) While csh(1) expands, for example, !3d to event 3
with the letter d appended to it, tcsh expands it to the
last event beginning with 3d ; only completely numeric
arguments are treated as event numbers. This makes it
possible to recall events beginning with numbers. To expand
!3d as in csh(1) say !{3}d.</p>

<p>To select words from an event we can follow the event
specification by a : and a designator for the desired words.
The words of an input line are numbered from 0, the first
(usually command) word being 0, the second word (first
argument) being 1, etc. The basic word designators are:</p>

<p>0 The first (command) word n The nth argument ^ The
first argument, equivalent to 1 $ The last argument % The
word matched by an ?s? search x-y A range of words -y
Equivalent to 0-y_ * Equivalent to ^-$, but returns nothing
if the event con- tains only 1 word x* Equivalent to x-$_ x-
Equivalent to x*, but omitting the last word ( $)</p>

<p>Selected words are inserted into the command line
separated by single blanks. For example, the diff command in
the previous example might have been typed as diff !!:1.old
!!:1 (using :1 to select the first argument from the
previous event) or diff !-2:2 !-2:1 to select and swap the
arguments from the cp command. If we didnt care about the
order of the diff we might have said diff !-2:1-2 or simply
diff !-2:* . The cp command might have been written cp
wumpus.man !#:1.old, using # to refer to the current event.
!n:- hurkle.man would reuse the first two words from the
nroff command to say nroff -man hurkle.man.</p>

<p>The : separating the event specification from the word
designator can be omitted if the argument selector begins
with a ^, $, *, % or -. For example, our diff command might
have been diff !!^.old !!^ or, equivalently, diff !!$.old
!!$. However, if !! is abbre- viated !, an argument selector
beginning with - will be interpreted as an event
specification.</p>

<p>A history reference may have a word designator but no
event specifica- tion. It then references the previous
command. Continuing our diff example, we could have said
simply diff !^.old !^ or, to get the arguments in the
opposite order, just diff !*.</p>

<p>The word or words in a history reference can be edited,
or modi- fied , by following it with one or more modifiers,
each preceded by a ::</p>

<p>h Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the
head. t Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the
tail. r Remove a filename extension .xxx, leaving the root
name. e Remove all but the extension. u Uppercase the first
lowercase letter. l Lowercase the first uppercase letter.
s/l/r/ Substitute l for r. l is simply a string like r, not
a regular expression as in the eponymous ed(1) command. Any
character may be used as the delimiter in place of /; a can
be used to quote the delimiter expect ( , ), | and &gt;
inside l and r. The character &amp; in the r is replaced by
l; also quotes &amp;. If l is empty (), the l from a
previous substitution or the s from a previous search or
event number in event specification is used. The trailing
delimiter may be omitted if it is immediately fol- lowed by
a newline. &amp; Repeat the previous substitution. g Apply
the following modifier once to each word. a (+) Apply the
following modifier as many times as possible to a single
word. a and g can be used together to apply a modifier
globally. With the s modifier, only the pat- terns contained
in the original word are substituted, not patterns that
contain any substitution result. p Print the new command
line but do not execute it. q Quote the substituted words,
preventing further substitu- tions. x Like q, but break into
words at blanks, tabs and newlines.</p>

<p>Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word
(unless g is used). It is an error for no word to be
modifiable.</p>

<p>For example, the diff command might have been written as
diff wum- pus.man.old !#^:r, using :r to remove .old from
the first argument on the same line (!#^). We could say echo
hello out there, then echo !*:u to capitalize hello, echo
!*:au to say it out loud, or echo !*:agu to really shout. We
might follow mail -s &quot;I forgot my password&quot; rot
with !:s/rot/root to correct the spelling of root (but see
Spelling correction for a different approach).</p>

<p>There is a special abbreviation for substitutions. ^ ,
when it is the first character on an input line, is
equivalent to !:s^. Thus we might have said ^rot^root to
make the spelling correction in the pre- vious example. This
is the only history substitution which does not explicitly
begin with !.</p>

<p>(+) In csh as such, only one modifier may be applied to
each history or variable expansion. In tcsh, more than one
may be used, for example</p>

<p>% mv wumpus.man /usr/man/man1/wumpus.1 % man !$:t:r man
wumpus</p>

<p>In csh, the result would be wumpus.1:r . A substitution
followed by a colon may need to be insulated from it with
braces:</p>

<p>&gt; mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus &gt; setenv PATH
!$:h:$PATH Bad ! modifier: $. &gt; setenv PATH
!{-2$:h}:$PATH setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.</p>

<p>The first attempt would succeed in csh but fails in
tcsh, because tcsh expects another modifier after the second
colon rather than $.</p>

<p>Finally, history can be accessed through the editor as
well as through the substitutions just described. The up-
and down-history, history- search-backward and -forward,
i-search-back and -fwd, vi-search-back and -fwd,
copy-prev-word and insert-last-word editor commands search
for events in the history list and copy them into the input
buffer. The toggle-literal-history editor command switches
between the expanded and literal forms of history lines in
the input buffer. expand-history and expand-line expand
history substitutions in the current word and in the entire
input buffer respectively.</p>

<p>Alias substitution The shell maintains a list of aliases
which can be set, unset and printed by the alias and unalias
commands. After a command line is parsed into simple
commands (see Commands) the first word of each com- mand,
left-to-right, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so,
the first word is replaced by the alias. If the alias
contains a history reference, it undergoes History
substitution (q.v.) as though the orig- inal command were
the previous input line. If the alias does not con- tain a
history reference, the argument list is left untouched.</p>

<p>Thus if the alias for ls were ls -l the command ls /usr
would become ls -l /usr , the argument list here being
undisturbed. If the alias for lookup were grep !^
/etc/passwd then lookup bill would become grep bill
/etc/passwd. Aliases can be used to introduce parser
metasyntax. For example, alias print pr * | lpr defines a
command (print) which pr(1)s its arguments to the line
printer.</p>

<p>Alias substitution is repeated until the first word of
the command has no alias. If an alias substitution does not
change the first word (as in the previous example) it is
flagged to prevent a loop. Other loops are detected and
cause an error.</p>

<p>Some aliases are referred to by the shell; see Special
aliases.</p>

<p>Variable substitution The shell maintains a list of
variables, each of which has as value a list of zero or more
words. The values of shell variables can be dis- played and
changed with the set and unset commands. The system main-
tains its own list of environment variables. These can be
dis- played and changed with printenv, setenv and
unsetenv.</p>

<p>(+) Variables may be made read-only with set -r (q.v.)
Read-only variables may not be modified or unset; attempting
to do so will cause an error. Once made read-only, a
variable cannot be made writable, so set -r should be used
with caution. Environment variables cannot be made
read-only.</p>

<p>Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by
it. For instance, the argv variable is an image of the shell
s argument list, and words of this variables value are
referred to in special ways. Some of the variables referred
to by the shell are toggles; the shell does not care what
their value is, only whether they are set or not. For
instance, the verbose variable is a toggle which causes
command input to be echoed. The -v command line option sets
this variable. Special shell variables lists all variables
which are referred to by the shell.</p>

<p>Other operations treat variables numerically. The @
command permits numeric calculations to be performed and the
result assigned to a vari- able. Variable values are,
however, always represented as (zero or more) strings. For
the purposes of numeric operations, the null string is
considered to be zero, and the second and subsequent words
of multi- word values are ignored.</p>

<p>After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before
each command is executed, variable substitution is performed
keyed by $ characters. This expansion can be prevented by
preceding the $ with a except within &quot;s where it always
occurs, and within s where it never occurs. Strings quoted
by are interpreted later (see Command sub- stitution below)
so $ substitution does not occur there until later, if at
all. A $ is passed unchanged if followed by a blank, tab, or
end-of-line.</p>

<p>Input/output redirections are recognized before variable
expansion, and are variable expanded separately. Otherwise,
the command name and entire argument list are expanded
together. It is thus possible for the first (command) word
(to this point) to generate more than one word, the first of
which becomes the command name, and the rest of which become
arguments.</p>

<p>Unless enclosed in &quot; or given the :q modifier the
results of vari- able substitution may eventually be command
and filename substituted. Within &quot;, a variable whose
value consists of multiple words expands to a (portion of a)
single word, with the words of the variables value separated
by blanks. When the :q modifier is applied to a substitu-
tion the variable will expand to multiple words with each
word sepa- rated by a blank and quoted to prevent later
command or filename sub- stitution.</p>

<p>The following metasequences are provided for introducing
variable val- ues into the shell input. Except as noted, it
is an error to reference a variable which is not set.</p>

<p>$name ${name} Substitutes the words of the value of
variable name, each sepa- rated by a blank. Braces insulate
name from following charac- ters which would otherwise be
part of it. Shell variables have names consisting of letters
and digits starting with a letter. The underscore character
is considered a letter. If name is not a shell variable, but
is set in the environment, then that value is returned (but
some of the other forms given below are not available in
this case). $name[selector] ${name[selector]} Substitutes
only the selected words from the value of name. The selector
is subjected to $ substitution and may consist of a single
number or two numbers separated by a -. The first word of a
variables value is numbered 1. If the first number of a
range is omitted it defaults to 1. If the last member of a
range is omitted it defaults to $#name. The selector *
selects all words. It is not an error for a range to be
empty if the second argument is omitted or in range. $0
Substitutes the name of the file from which command input is
being read. An error occurs if the name is not known.
$number ${number} Equivalent to $argv[number]. $* Equivalent
to $argv , which is equivalent to $argv[*].</p>

<p>The : modifiers described under History substitution,
except for :p, can be applied to the substitutions above.
More than one may be used. (+) Braces may be needed to
insulate a variable substitution from a literal colon just
as with History substitution (q.v.); any mod- ifiers must
appear within the braces.</p>

<p>The following substitutions can not be modified with :
modifiers.</p>

<p>$?name ${?name} Substitutes the string 1 if name is set,
0 if it is not. $?0 Substitutes 1 if the current input
filename is known, 0 if it is not. Always 0 in interactive
shells. $#name ${#name} Substitutes the number of words in
name. $# Equivalent to $#argv. (+) $%name ${%name}
Substitutes the number of characters in name. (+) $%number
${%number} Substitutes the number of characters in
$argv[number]. (+) $? Equivalent to $status. (+) $$
Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the (parent)
shell. $! Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the
last background process started by this shell. (+) $_
Substitutes the command line of the last command executed.
(+) $&lt; Substitutes a line from the standard input, with
no further interpretation thereafter. It can be used to read
from the keyboard in a shell script. (+) While csh always
quotes $&lt;, as if it were equivalent to $&lt;:q, tcsh does
not. Furthermore, when tcsh is waiting for a line to be
typed the user may type an interrupt to interrupt the
sequence into which the line is to be substituted, but csh
does not allow this.</p>

<p>The editor command expand-variables, normally bound to
^X-$, can be used to interactively expand individual
variables.</p>

<p>Command, filename and directory stack substitution The
remaining substitutions are applied selectively to the
arguments of builtin commands. This means that portions of
expressions which are not evaluated are not subjected to
these expansions. For commands which are not internal to the
shell, the command name is substituted separately from the
argument list. This occurs very late, after input- output
redirection is performed, and in a child of the main
shell.</p>

<p>Command substitution Command substitution is indicated
by a command enclosed in . The output from such a command is
broken into separate words at blanks, tabs and newlines, and
null words are discarded. The output is vari- able and
command substituted and put in place of the original
string.</p>

<p>Command substitutions inside double quotes (&quot;)
retain blanks and tabs; only newlines force new words. The
single final newline does not force a new word in any case.
It is thus possible for a command sub- stitution to yield
only part of a word, even if the command outputs a complete
line.</p>

<p>By default, the shell since version 6.12 replaces all
newline and car- riage return characters in the command by
spaces. If this is switched off by unsetting csubstnonl,
newlines separate commands as usual.</p>

<p>Filename substitution If a word contains any of the
characters *, ?, [ or { or begins with the character ~ it is
a candidate for filename substitution, also known as
globbing. This word is then regarded as a pattern
(glob-pattern), and replaced with an alphabetically sorted
list of file names which match the pattern.</p>

<p>In matching filenames, the character . at the beginning
of a filename or immediately following a /, as well as the
character / must be matched explicitly. The character *
matches any string of charac- ters, including the null
string. The character ? matches any single character. The
sequence [...] matches any one of the characters enclosed.
Within [...] , a pair of characters separated by - matches
any character lexically between the two.</p>

<p>(+) Some glob-patterns can be negated: The sequence
[^...] matches any single character not specified by the
characters and/or ranges of characters in the braces.</p>

<p>An entire glob-pattern can also be negated with ^:</p>

<p>&gt; echo * bang crash crunch ouch &gt; echo ^cr* bang
ouch</p>

<p>Glob-patterns which do not use ?, *, or [] or which use
{} or ~ (below) are not negated correctly.</p>

<p>The metanotation a{b,c,d}e is a shorthand for abe ace
ade . Left- to-right order is preserved:
/usr/source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c expands to
/usr/source/s1/oldls.c /usr/source/s1/ls.c. The results of
matches are sorted separately at a low level to preserve
this order: ../{memo,*box} might expand to ../memo ../box
../mbox . (Note that memo was not sorted with the results of
matching *box.) It is not an error when this construct
expands to files which do not exist, but it is possible to
get an error from a command to which the expanded list is
passed. This construct may be nested. As a special case the
words {, } and {} are passed undisturbed.</p>

<p>The character ~ at the beginning of a filename refers to
home direc- tories. Standing alone, i.e., ~ , it expands to
the invokers home directory as reflected in the value of the
home shell variable. When followed by a name consisting of
letters, digits and - characters the shell searches for a
user with that name and substitutes their home directory;
thus ~ken might expand to /usr/ken and ~ken/chmach to
/usr/ken/chmach . If the character ~ is followed by a
character other than a letter or / or appears elsewhere than
at the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed. A
command like setenv MANPATH
/usr/man:/usr/local/man:~/lib/man does not, therefore, do
home direc- tory substitution as one might hope.</p>

<p>It is an error for a glob-pattern containing *, ?, [ or
~, with or without ^, not to match any files. However, only
one pattern in a list of glob-patterns must match a file (so
that, e.g., rm *.a *.c *.o would fail only if there were no
files in the current directory ending in .a , .c, or .o),
and if the nonomatch shell variable is set a pattern (or
list of patterns) which matches nothing is left unchanged
rather than causing an error.</p>

<p>The noglob shell variable can be set to prevent filename
substitution, and the expand-glob editor command, normally
bound to ^X-*, can be used to interactively expand
individual filename substitutions.</p>

<p>Directory stack substitution (+) The directory stack is
a list of directories, numbered from zero, used by the
pushd, popd and dirs builtin commands (q.v.). dirs can
print, store in a file, restore and clear the directory
stack at any time, and the savedirs and dirsfile shell
variables can be set to store the directory stack
automatically on logout and restore it on login. The
dirstack shell variable can be examined to see the directory
stack and set to put arbitrary directories into the
directory stack.</p>

<p>The character = followed by one or more digits expands
to an entry in the directory stack. The special case =-
expands to the last direc- tory in the stack. For
example,</p>

<p>&gt; dirs -v 0 /usr/bin 1 /usr/spool/uucp 2
/usr/accts/sys &gt; echo =1 /usr/spool/uucp &gt; echo
=0/calendar /usr/bin/calendar &gt; echo =-
/usr/accts/sys</p>

<p>The noglob and nonomatch shell variables and the
expand-glob editor command apply to directory stack as well
as filename substitutions.</p>

<p>Other substitutions (+) There are several more
transformations involving filenames, not strictly related to
the above but mentioned here for completeness. Any filename
may be expanded to a full path when the symlinks variable
(q.v.) is set to expand . Quoting prevents this expansion,
and the normalize-path editor command does it on demand. The
normalize-command editor command expands commands in PATH
into full paths on demand. Finally, cd and pushd interpret -
as the old working directory (equivalent to the shell
variable owd). This is not a substitution at all, but an
abbreviation recognized by only those commands. Nonethe-
less, it too can be prevented by quoting.</p>

<p>Commands The next three sections describe how the shell
executes commands and deals with their input and output.</p>

<p>Simple commands, pipelines and sequences A simple
command is a sequence of words, the first of which specifies
the command to be executed. A series of simple commands
joined by | characters forms a pipeline. The output of each
command in a pipeline is connected to the input of the
next.</p>

<p>Simple commands and pipelines may be joined into
sequences with ;, and will be executed sequentially.
Commands and pipelines can also be joined into sequences
with || or &amp;&amp;, indicating, as in the C lan- guage,
that the second is to be executed only if the first fails or
succeeds respectively.</p>

<p>A simple command, pipeline or sequence may be placed in
parentheses, () , to form a simple command, which may in
turn be a component of a pipeline or sequence. A command,
pipeline or sequence can be executed without waiting for it
to terminate by following it with an &amp;.</p>

<p>Builtin and non-builtin command execution Builtin
commands are executed within the shell. If any component of
a pipeline except the last is a builtin command, the
pipeline is executed in a subshell.</p>

<p>Parenthesized commands are always executed in a
subshell.</p>

<p>(cd; pwd); pwd</p>

<p>thus prints the home directory, leaving you where you
were (printing this after the home directory), while</p>

<p>cd; pwd</p>

<p>leaves you in the home directory. Parenthesized commands
are most often used to prevent cd from affecting the current
shell.</p>

<p>When a command to be executed is found not to be a
builtin command the shell attempts to execute the command
via execve(2). Each word in the variable path names a
directory in which the shell will look for the command. If
the shell is not given a -f option, the shell hashes the
names in these directories into an internal table so that it
will try an execve(2) in only a directory where there is a
possibility that the command resides there. This greatly
speeds command location when a large number of directories
are present in the search path. This hash- ing mechanism is
not used:</p>

<p>1. If hashing is turned explicitly off via unhash.</p>

<p>2. If the shell was given a -f argument.</p>

<p>3. For each directory component of path which does not
begin with a /.</p>

<p>4. If the command contains a /.</p>

<p>In the above four cases the shell concatenates each
component of the path vector with the given command name to
form a path name of a file which it then attempts to execute
it. If execution is successful, the search stops.</p>

<p>If the file has execute permissions but is not an
executable to the system (i.e., it is neither an executable
binary nor a script that specifies its interpreter), then it
is assumed to be a file containing shell commands and a new
shell is spawned to read it. The shell spe- cial alias may
be set to specify an interpreter other than the shell
itself.</p>

<p>On systems which do not understand the #! script
interpreter conven- tion the shell may be compiled to
emulate it; see the version shell variable. If so, the shell
checks the first line of the file to see if it is of the
form #!interpreter arg .... If it is, the shell starts
interpreter with the given args and feeds the file to it on
standard input.</p>

<p>Input/output The standard input and standard output of a
command may be redirected with the following syntax:</p>

<p>&lt; name Open file name (which is first variable,
command and filename expanded) as the standard input.
&lt;&lt; word Read the shell input up to a line which is
identical to word. word is not subjected to variable,
filename or command substi- tution, and each input line is
compared to word before any sub- stitutions are done on this
input line. Unless a quoting , &quot;, or appears in word
variable and command substitu- tion is performed on the
intervening lines, allowing to quote $, and . Commands which
are substituted have all blanks, tabs, and newlines
preserved, except for the final newline which is dropped.
The resultant text is placed in an anonymous temporary file
which is given to the command as stan- dard input. &gt; name
&gt;! name &gt;&amp; name &gt;&amp;! name The file name is
used as standard output. If the file does not exist then it
is created; if the file exists, it is truncated, its
previous contents being lost.</p>

<p>If the shell variable noclobber is set, then the file
must not exist or be a character special file (e.g., a
terminal or /dev/null ) or an error results. This helps
prevent acciden- tal destruction of files. In this case the
! forms can be used to suppress this check.</p>

<p>The forms involving &amp; route the diagnostic output
into the specified file as well as the standard output. name
is expanded in the same way as &lt; input filenames are.
&gt;&gt; name &gt;&gt;&amp; name &gt;&gt;! name
&gt;&gt;&amp;! name Like &gt;, but appends output to the end
of name. If the shell variable noclobber is set, then it is
an error for the file not to exist, unless one of the !
forms is given.</p>

<p>A command receives the environment in which the shell
was invoked as modified by the input-output parameters and
the presence of the command in a pipeline. Thus, unlike some
previous shells, commands run from a file of shell commands
have no access to the text of the commands by default;
rather they receive the original standard input of the
shell. The &lt;&lt; mechanism should be used to present
inline data. This permits shell command scripts to function
as components of pipelines and allows the shell to block
read its input. Note that the default standard input for a
command run detached is not the empty file /dev/null, but
the original standard input of the shell. If this is a
terminal and if the process attempts to read from the
terminal, then the process will block and the user will be
notified (see Jobs).</p>

<p>Diagnostic output may be directed through a pipe with
the standard output. Simply use the form |&amp; rather than
just |.</p>

<p>The shell cannot presently redirect diagnostic output
without also redirecting standard output, but (command &gt;
output-file) &gt;&amp; error- file is often an acceptable
workaround. Either output-file or error- file may be
/dev/tty to send output to the terminal.</p>

<p>Features Having described how the shell accepts, parses
and executes command lines, we now turn to a variety of its
useful features.</p>

<p>Control flow The shell contains a number of commands
which can be used to regulate the flow of control in command
files (shell scripts) and (in limited but useful ways) from
terminal input. These commands all operate by forcing the
shell to reread or skip in its input and, due to the imple-
mentation, restrict the placement of some of the
commands.</p>

<p>The foreach, switch, and while statements, as well as
the if-then-else form of the if statement, require that the
major keywords appear in a single simple command on an input
line as shown below.</p>

<p>If the shells input is not seekable, the shell buffers
up input when- ever a loop is being read and performs seeks
in this internal buffer to accomplish the rereading implied
by the loop. (To the extent that this allows, backward gotos
will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)</p>

<p>Expressions The if, while and exit builtin commands use
expressions with a common syntax. The expressions can
include any of the operators described in the next three
sections. Note that the @ builtin command (q.v.) has its own
separate syntax.</p>

<p>Logical, arithmetical and comparison operators These
operators are similar to those of C and have the same
precedence. They include</p>

<p>|| &amp;&amp; | ^ &amp; == != =~ !~ &lt;= &gt;= &lt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; + - * / % ! ~ ( )</p>

<p>Here the precedence increases to the right, == != =~ and
!~, &lt;= &gt;= &lt; and &gt;, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;, + and
-, * / and % being, in groups, at the same level. When
multiple operators which have same precedence are used in
one expression, calculation must be done from operator of
right side. The == != =~ and !~ opera- tors compare their
arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers. The
operators =~ and !~ are like != and == except that the right
hand side is a glob-pattern (see Filename substitution)
against which the left hand operand is matched. This reduces
the need for use of the switch builtin command in shell
scripts when all that is really needed is pattern
matching.</p>

<p>Null or missing arguments are considered 0. The results
of all expressions are strings, which represent decimal
numbers. It is impor- tant to note that no two components of
an expression can appear in the same word; except when
adjacent to components of expressions which are
syntactically significant to the parser (&amp; | &lt; &gt; (
)) they should be surrounded by spaces.</p>

<p>Command exit status Commands can be executed in
expressions and their exit status returned by enclosing them
in braces ( {}). Remember that the braces should be
separated from the words of the command by spaces. Command
executions succeed, returning true, i.e., 1, if the command
exits with status 0, otherwise they fail, returning false,
i.e., 0 . If more detailed sta- tus information is required
then the command should be executed outside of an expression
and the status shell variable examined.</p>

<p>File inquiry operators Some of these operators perform
true/false tests on files and related objects. They are of
the form -op file, where op is one of</p>

<p>r Read access w Write access x Execute access X
Executable in the path or shell builtin, e.g., -X ls and -X
ls-F are generally true, but -X /bin/ls is not (+) e
Existence o Ownership z Zero size s Non-zero size (+) f
Plain file d Directory l Symbolic link (+) * b Block special
file (+) c Character special file (+) p Named pipe (fifo)
(+) * S Socket special file (+) * u Set-user-ID bit is set
(+) g Set-group-ID bit is set (+) k Sticky bit is set (+) t
file (which must be a digit) is an open file descriptor for
a terminal device (+) R Has been migrated (convex only) (+)
L Applies subsequent operators in a multiple-operator test
to a symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link
points (+) *</p>

<p>file is command and filename expanded and then tested to
see if it has the specified relationship to the real user.
If file does not exist or is inaccessible or, for the
operators indicated by *, if the speci- fied file type does
not exist on the current system, then all enquiries return
false, i.e., 0.</p>

<p>These operators may be combined for conciseness: -xy
file is equiva- lent to -x file &amp;&amp; -y file. (+) For
example, -fx is true (returns 1) for plain executable files,
but not for directories.</p>

<p>L may be used in a multiple-operator test to apply
subsequent operators to a symbolic link rather than to the
file to which the link points. For example, -lLo is true for
links owned by the invoking user. Lr, Lw and Lx are always
true for links and false for non-links. L has a different
meaning when it is the last operator in a multiple-operator
test; see below.</p>

<p>It is possible but not useful, and sometimes misleading,
to combine operators which expect file to be a file with
operators which do not, (e.g., X and t). Following L with a
non-file operator can lead to par- ticularly strange
results.</p>

<p>Other operators return other information, i.e., not just
0 or 1. (+) They have the same format as before; op may be
one of</p>

<p>A Last file access time, as the number of seconds since
the epoch A: Like A, but in timestamp format, e.g., Fri May
14 16:36:10 1993 M Last file modification time M: Like M,
but in timestamp format C Last inode modification time C:
Like C, but in timestamp format D Device number I Inode
number F Composite file identifier, in the form device:inode
L The name of the file pointed to by a symbolic link N
Number of (hard) links P Permissions, in octal, without
leading zero P: Like P, with leading zero Pmode Equivalent
to -P file &amp; mode, e.g., -P22 file returns 22 if file is
writable by group and other, 20 if by group only, and 0 if
by neither Pmode: Like Pmode, with leading zero U Numeric
userid U: Username, or the numeric userid if the username is
unknown G Numeric groupid G: Groupname, or the numeric
groupid if the groupname is unknown Z Size, in bytes</p>

<p>Only one of these operators may appear in a
multiple-operator test, and it must be the last. Note that L
has a different meaning at the end of and elsewhere in a
multiple-operator test. Because 0 is a valid return value
for many of these operators, they do not return 0 when they
fail: most return -1, and F returns :.</p>

<p>If the shell is compiled with POSIX defined (see the
version shell variable), the result of a file inquiry is
based on the permission bits of the file and not on the
result of the access(2) system call. For example, if one
tests a file with -w whose permissions would ordinarily
allow writing but which is on a file system mounted
read-only, the test will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail
in a non-POSIX shell.</p>

<p>File inquiry operators can also be evaluated with the
filetest builtin command (q.v.) (+).</p>

<p>Jobs The shell associates a job with each pipeline. It
keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the jobs command,
and assigns them small inte- ger numbers. When a job is
started asynchronously with &amp; , the shell prints a line
which looks like</p>

<p>[1] 1234</p>

<p>indicating that the job which was started asynchronously
was job number 1 and had one (top-level) process, whose
process id was 1234.</p>

<p>If you are running a job and wish to do something else
you may hit the suspend key (usually ^Z), which sends a STOP
signal to the current job. The shell will then normally
indicate that the job has been Sus- pended and print another
prompt. If the listjobs shell variable is set, all jobs will
be listed like the jobs builtin command; if it is set to
long the listing will be in long format, like jobs -l. You
can then manipulate the state of the suspended job. You can
put it in the background with the bg command or run some
other commands and eventually bring the job back into the
foreground with fg. (See also the run-fg-editor editor
command.) A ^Z takes effect immedi- ately and is like an
interrupt in that pending output and unread input are
discarded when it is typed. The wait builtin command causes
the shell to wait for all background jobs to complete.</p>

<p>The ^] key sends a delayed suspend signal, which does
not generate a STOP signal until a program attempts to
read(2) it, to the current job. This can usefully be typed
ahead when you have prepared some commands for a job which
you wish to stop after it has read them. The ^Y key performs
this function in csh(1); in tcsh, ^Y is an editing command.
(+)</p>

<p>A job being run in the background stops if it tries to
read from the terminal. Background jobs are normally allowed
to produce output, but this can be disabled by giving the
command stty tostop. If you set this tty option, then
background jobs will stop when they try to pro- duce output
like they do when they try to read input.</p>

<p>There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.
The character % introduces a job name. If you wish to refer
to job number 1, you can name it as %1. Just naming a job
brings it to the foreground; thus %1 is a synonym for fg %1,
bringing job 1 back into the fore- ground. Similarly, saying
%1 &amp; resumes job 1 in the background, just like bg %1. A
job can also be named by an unambiguous prefix of the string
typed in to start it: %ex would normally restart a suspended
ex(1) job, if there were only one suspended job whose name
began with the string ex. It is also possible to say
%?string to specify a job whose text contains string, if
there is only one such job.</p>

<p>The shell maintains a notion of the current and previous
jobs. In out- put pertaining to jobs, the current job is
marked with a + and the previous job with a -. The
abbreviations %+, %, and (by analogy with the syntax of the
history mechanism) %% all refer to the current job, and %-
refers to the previous job.</p>

<p>The job control mechanism requires that the stty(1)
option new be set on some systems. It is an artifact from a
new implementation of the tty driver which allows generation
of interrupt characters from the keyboard to tell jobs to
stop. See stty(1) and the setty builtin com- mand for
details on setting options in the new tty driver.</p>

<p>Status reporting The shell learns immediately whenever a
process changes state. It nor- mally informs you whenever a
job becomes blocked so that no further progress is possible,
but only right before it prints a prompt. This is done so
that it does not otherwise disturb your work. If, however,
you set the shell variable notify, the shell will notify you
immedi- ately of changes of status in background jobs. There
is also a shell command notify which marks a single process
so that its status changes will be immediately reported. By
default notify marks the current pro- cess; simply say
notify after starting a background job to mark it.</p>

<p>When you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped,
you will be warned that There are suspended jobs. You may
use the jobs command to see what they are. If you do this or
immediately try to exit again, the shell will not warn you a
second time, and the suspended jobs will be terminated.</p>

<p>Automatic, periodic and timed events (+) There are
various ways to run commands and take other actions
automati- cally at various times in the life cycle of the
shell. They are summarized here, and described in detail
under the appropriate Builtin commands, Special shell
variables and Special aliases.</p>

<p>The sched builtin command puts commands in a
scheduled-event list, to be executed by the shell at a given
time.</p>

<p>The beepcmd, cwdcmd, periodic, precmd, postcmd, and
jobcmd Special aliases can be set, respectively, to execute
commands when the shell wants to ring the bell, when the
working directory changes, every tpe- riod minutes, before
each prompt, before each command gets executed, after each
command gets executed, and when a job is started or is
brought into the foreground.</p>

<p>The autologout shell variable can be set to log out or
lock the shell after a given number of minutes of
inactivity.</p>

<p>The mail shell variable can be set to check for new mail
periodically.</p>

<p>The printexitvalue shell variable can be set to print
the exit status of commands which exit with a status other
than zero.</p>

<p>The rmstar shell variable can be set to ask the user,
when rm * is typed, if that is really what was meant.</p>

<p>The time shell variable can be set to execute the time
builtin command after the completion of any process that
takes more than a given number of CPU seconds.</p>

<p>The watch and who shell variables can be set to report
when selected users log in or out, and the log builtin
command reports on those users at any time.</p>

<p>Native Language System support (+) The shell is eight
bit clean (if so compiled; see the version shell variable)
and thus supports character sets needing this capability.
NLS support differs depending on whether or not the shell
was compiled to use the systems NLS (again, see version). In
either case, 7-bit ASCII is the default character code
(e.g., the classification of which characters are printable)
and sorting, and changing the LANG or LC_CTYPE environment
variables causes a check for possible changes in these
respects.</p>

<p>When using the systems NLS, the setlocale(3) function is
called to determine appropriate character
code/classification and sorting (e.g., a en_CA.UTF-8 would
yield &quot;UTF-8&quot; as a character code). This func-
tion typically examines the LANG and LC_CTYPE environment
variables; refer to the system documentation for further
details. When not using the systems NLS, the shell simulates
it by assuming that the ISO 8859-1 character set is used
whenever either of the LANG and LC_CTYPE variables are set,
regardless of their values. Sorting is not affected for the
simulated NLS.</p>

<p>In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all
printable characters in the range 200-377, i.e., those that
have M-char bindings, are automatically rebound to
self-insert-command. The corresponding bind- ing for the
escape-char sequence, if any, is left alone. These charac-
ters are not rebound if the NOREBIND environment variable is
set. This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive
real NLS which assumes full ISO 8859-1. Otherwise, all
M-char bindings in the range 240-377 are effectively undone.
Explicitly rebinding the relevant keys with bindkey is of
course still possible.</p>

<p>Unknown characters (i.e., those that are neither
printable nor control characters) are printed in the format
0n. If the tty is not in 8 bit mode, other 8 bit characters
are printed by converting them to ASCII and using standout
mode. The shell never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty
and tracks user-initiated changes of 7/8 bit mode. NLS users
(or, for that matter, those who want to use a meta key) may
need to explicitly set the tty in 8 bit mode through the
appropriate stty(1) command in, e.g., the ~/.login file.</p>

<p>OS variant support (+) A number of new builtin commands
are provided to support features in particular operating
systems. All are described in detail in the Builtin commands
section.</p>

<p>On systems that support TCF (aix-ibm370, aix-ps2),
getspath and setspath get and set the system execution path,
getxvers and setxvers get and set the experimental version
prefix and migrate migrates pro- cesses between sites. The
jobs builtin prints the site on which each job is
executing.</p>

<p>Under BS2000, bs2cmd executes commands of the underlying
BS2000/OSD operating system.</p>

<p>Under Domain/OS, inlib adds shared libraries to the
current environ- ment, rootnode changes the rootnode and ver
changes the systype.</p>

<p>Under Mach, setpath is equivalent to Machs
setpath(1).</p>

<p>Under Masscomp/RTU and Harris CX/UX, universe sets the
universe.</p>

<p>Under Harris CX/UX, ucb or att runs a command under the
specified uni- verse.</p>

<p>Under Convex/OS, warp prints or sets the universe.</p>

<p>The VENDOR, OSTYPE and MACHTYPE environment variables
indicate respec- tively the vendor, operating system and
machine type (microprocessor class or machine model) of the
system on which the shell thinks it is running. These are
particularly useful when sharing one s home direc- tory
between several types of machines; one can, for example,</p>

<p>set path = (~/bin.$MACHTYPE /usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin
.)</p>

<p>in one s ~/.login and put executables compiled for each
machine in the appropriate directory.</p>

<p>The version shell variable indicates what options were
chosen when the shell was compiled.</p>

<p>Note also the newgrp builtin, the afsuser and echo_style
shell vari- ables and the system-dependent locations of the
shell s input files (see FILES).</p>

<p>Signal handling Login shells ignore interrupts when
reading the file ~/.logout. The shell ignores quit signals
unless started with -q. Login shells catch the terminate
signal, but non-login shells inherit the terminate behav-
ior from their parents. Other signals have the values which
the shell inherited from its parent.</p>

<p>In shell scripts, the shells handling of interrupt and
terminate sig- nals can be controlled with onintr, and its
handling of hangups can be controlled with hup and
nohup.</p>

<p>The shell exits on a hangup (see also the logout shell
variable). By default, the shells children do too, but the
shell does not send them a hangup when it exits. hup
arranges for the shell to send a hangup to a child when it
exits, and nohup sets a child to ignore hangups.</p>

<p>Terminal management (+) The shell uses three different
sets of terminal (tty ) modes: edit, used when editing,
quote , used when quoting literal charac- ters, and execute,
used when executing commands. The shell holds some settings
in each mode constant, so commands which leave the tty in a
confused state do not interfere with the shell. The shell
also matches changes in the speed and padding of the tty.
The list of tty modes that are kept constant can be examined
and modified with the setty builtin. Note that although the
editor uses CBREAK mode (or its equivalent), it takes
typed-ahead characters anyway.</p>

<p>The echotc, settc and telltc commands can be used to
manipulate and debug terminal capabilities from the command
line.</p>

<p>On systems that support SIGWINCH or SIGWINDOW, the shell
adapts to win- dow resizing automatically and adjusts the
environment variables LINES and COLUMNS if set. If the
environment variable TERMCAP contains li# and co# fields,
the shell adjusts them to reflect the new window size.</p>

<p>REFERENCE The next sections of this manual describe all
of the available Builtin commands, Special aliases and
Special shell variables.</p>

<p>Builtin commands %job A synonym for the fg builtin
command.</p>

<p>%job &amp; A synonym for the bg builtin command.</p>

<p>: Does nothing, successfully.</p>

<p>@ @ name = expr @ name[index] = expr @ name++|-- @
name[index]++|-- The first form prints the values of all
shell variables.</p>

<p>The second form assigns the value of expr to name. The
third form assigns the value of expr to the indexth
component of name; both name and its index th component must
already exist.</p>

<p>expr may contain the operators *, +, etc., as in C. If
expr contains &lt;, &gt;, &amp; or then at least that part
of expr must be placed within (). Note that the syntax of
expr has nothing to do with that described under
Expressions.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth forms increment (++) or decrement
(--) name or its indexth component.</p>

<p>The space between @ and name is required. The spaces
between name and = and between = and expr are optional.
Components of expr must be separated by spaces.</p>

<p>alias [name [wordlist]] Without arguments, prints all
aliases. With name, prints the alias for name. With name and
wordlist, assigns wordlist as the alias of name. wordlist is
command and filename substi- tuted. name may not be alias or
unalias. See also the unalias builtin command.</p>

<p>alloc Shows the amount of dynamic memory acquired,
broken down into used and free memory. With an argument
shows the number of free and used blocks in each size
category. The categories start at size 8 and double at each
step. This commands output may vary across system types,
because systems other than the VAX may use a different
memory allocator.</p>

<p>bg [%job ...] Puts the specified jobs (or, without
arguments, the current job) into the background, continuing
each if it is stopped. job may be a number, a string, , %, +
or - as described under Jobs.</p>

<p>bindkey [-l|-d|-e|-v|-u] (+) bindkey [-a] [-b] [-k] [-r]
[--] key (+) bindkey [-a] [-b] [-k] [-c|-s] [--] key command
(+) Without options, the first form lists all bound keys and
the editor command to which each is bound, the second form
lists the editor command to which key is bound and the third
form binds the editor command command to key. Options
include:</p>

<p>-l Lists all editor commands and a short description of
each. -d Binds all keys to the standard bindings for the
default editor. -e Binds all keys to the standard GNU
Emacs-like bindings. -v Binds all keys to the standard
vi(1)-like bindings. -a Lists or changes key-bindings in the
alternative key map. This is the key map used in vi command
mode. -b key is interpreted as a control character written
^charac- ter (e.g., ^A) or C-character (e.g., C-A ), a meta
char- acter written M-character (e.g., M-A), a function key
written F-string (e.g., F-string ), or an extended prefix
key written X-character (e.g., X-A). -k key is interpreted
as a symbolic arrow key name, which may be one of down, up,
left or right. -r Removes keys binding. Be careful: bindkey
-r does not bind key to self-insert-command (q.v.), it
unbinds key com- pletely. -c command is interpreted as a
builtin or external command instead of an editor command. -s
command is taken as a literal string and treated as termi-
nal input when key is typed. Bound keys in command are
themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten levels
of interpretation. -- Forces a break from option processing,
so the next word is taken as key even if it begins with -.
-u (or any invalid option) Prints a usage message.</p>

<p>key may be a single character or a string. If a command
is bound to a string, the first character of the string is
bound to sequence-lead-in and the entire string is bound to
the com- mand.</p>

<p>Control characters in key can be literal (they can be
typed by preceding them with the editor command
quoted-insert, normally bound to ^V) or written
caret-character style, e.g., ^A. Delete is written ^?
(caret-question mark). key and command can contain
backslashed escape sequences (in the style of Sys- tem V
echo(1)) as follows:</p>

<p>a Bell b B a c k s p a c e e Escape f Form feed n
Newliner Carriage return t Horizontal tab Vertical tab nnn
The ASCII character corresponding to the octal num- ber
nnn</p>

<p>nullifies the special meaning of the following
character, if it has any, notably and ^.</p>

<p>bs2cmd bs2000-command (+) Passes bs2000-command to the
BS2000 command interpreter for execution. Only
non-interactive commands can be executed, and it is not
possible to execute any command that would overlay the image
of the current process, like /EXECUTE or /CALL-PROCE- DURE.
(BS2000 only)</p>

<p>break Causes execution to resume after the end of the
nearest enclos- ing foreach or while. The remaining commands
on the current line are executed. Multi-level breaks are
thus possible by writing them all on one line.</p>

<p>breaksw Causes a break from a switch, resuming after the
endsw.</p>

<p>builtins (+) Prints the names of all builtin
commands.</p>

<p>bye (+) A synonym for the logout builtin command.
Available only if the shell was so compiled; see the version
shell variable.</p>

<p>case label: A label in a switch statement as discussed
below.</p>

<p>cd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [name] If a directory name is
given, changes the shells working directory to name. If not,
changes to home. If name is - it is interpreted as the
previous working directory (see Other substitutions). (+) If
name is not a subdirectory of the cur- rent directory (and
does not begin with /, ./ or ../), each component of the
variable cdpath is checked to see if it has a subdirectory
name. Finally, if all else fails but name is a shell
variable whose value begins with /, then this is tried to
see if it is a directory.</p>

<p>With -p, prints the final directory stack, just like
dirs. The -l, -n and -v flags have the same effect on cd as
on dirs, and they imply -p. (+)</p>

<p>See also the implicitcd shell variable.</p>

<p>chdir A synonym for the cd builtin command.</p>

<p>complete [command
[word/pattern/list[:select]/[[suffix]/] ...]] (+) Without
arguments, lists all completions. With command, lists
completions for command. With command and word etc., defines
completions.</p>

<p>command may be a full command name or a glob-pattern
(see File- name substitution). It can begin with - to
indicate that completion should be used only when command is
ambiguous.</p>

<p>word specifies which word relative to the current word
is to be completed, and may be one of the following:</p>

<p>c Current-word completion. pattern is a glob-pattern
which must match the beginning of the current word on the
command line. pattern is ignored when completing the current
word. C Like c, but includes pattern when completing the
cur- rent word. n Next-word completion. pattern is a
glob-pattern which must match the beginning of the previous
word on the command line. N Like n, but must match the
beginning of the word two before the current word. p
Position-dependent completion. pattern is a numeric range,
with the same syntax used to index shell vari- ables, which
must include the current word.</p>

<p>list, the list of possible completions, may be one of
the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>a Aliases b Bindings (editor commands) c Commands
(builtin or external commands) C External commands which
begin with the supplied path prefix d Directories D
Directories which begin with the supplied path pre- fix e
Environment variables f Filenames F Filenames which begin
with the supplied path prefix g Groupnames j Jobs l Limits n
Nothing s Shell variables S Signals t Plain (text) files T
Plain (text) files which begin with the sup- plied path
prefix v Any variables u Usernames x Like n, but prints
select when list-choices is used. X Completions $var Words
from the variable var (...) Words from the given list ...
Words from the output of command</p>

<p>select is an optional glob-pattern. If given, words from
only list that match select are considered and the fignore
shell variable is ignored. The last three types of
completion may not have a select pattern, and x uses select
as an explanatory message when the list-choices editor
command is used.</p>

<p>suffix is a single character to be appended to a
successful completion. If null, no character is appended. If
omitted (in which case the fourth delimiter can also be
omitted), a slash is appended to directories and a space to
other words.</p>

<p>command invoked from ... version has additional
environment variable set, the variable name is COMMAND_LINE
and contains (as its name indicates) contents of the current
(already typed in) command line. One can examine and use
contents of the COMMAND_LINE variable in her custom script
to build more sophisticated completions (see completion for
svn(1) included in this package).</p>

<p>Now for some examples. Some commands take only
directories as arguments, so theres no point completing
plain files.</p>

<p>&gt; complete cd p/1/d/</p>

<p>completes only the first word following cd ( p/1) with a
directory. p-type completion can also be used to narrow down
command completion:</p>

<p>&gt; co[^D] complete compress &gt; complete -co*
p/0/(compress)/ &gt; co[^D] &gt; compress</p>

<p>This completion completes commands (words in position 0,
p/0) which begin with co (thus matching co* ) to compress
(the only word in the list). The leading - indicates that
this completion is to be used with only ambiguous
commands.</p>

<p>&gt; complete find n/-user/u/</p>

<p>is an example of n-type completion. Any word following
find and immediately following -user is completed from the
list of users.</p>

<p>&gt; complete cc c/-I/d/</p>

<p>demonstrates c-type completion. Any word following cc
and beginning with -I is completed as a directory. -I is not
taken as part of the directory because we used lowercase
c.</p>

<p>Different lists are useful with different commands.</p>

<p>&gt; complete alias p/1/a/ &gt; complete man p/*/c/ &gt;
complete set p/1/s/ &gt; complete true p/1/x:Truth has no
options./</p>

<p>These complete words following alias with aliases, man
with commands, and set with shell variables. true doesnt
have any options, so x does nothing when completion is
attempted and prints Truth has no options. when completion
choices are listed.</p>

<p>Note that the man example, and several other examples
below, could just as well have used c/* or n/* as p/*.</p>

<p>Words can be completed from a variable evaluated at
completion time,</p>

<p>&gt; complete ftp p/1/$hostnames/ &gt; set hostnames =
(rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu) &gt; ftp [^D]
rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu &gt; ftp [^C] &gt; set
hostnames = (rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu uunet.uu.net)
&gt; ftp [^D] rtfm.mit.edu tesla.ee.cornell.edu
uunet.uu.net</p>

<p>or from a command run at completion time:</p>

<p>&gt; complete kill p/*/ps | awk print / &gt; kill -9
[^D] 23113 23377 23380 23406 23429 23529 23530 PID</p>

<p>Note that the complete command does not itself quote its
argu- ments, so the braces, space and $ in {print $1} must
be quoted explicitly.</p>

<p>One command can have multiple completions:</p>

<p>&gt; complete dbx p/2/(core)/ p/*/c/</p>

<p>completes the second argument to dbx with the word core
and all other arguments with commands. Note that the
positional completion is specified before the next-word
completion. Because completions are evaluated from left to
right, if the next-word completion were specified first it
would always match and the positional completion would never
be executed. This is a common mistake when defining a
completion.</p>

<p>The select pattern is useful when a command takes files
with only particular forms as arguments. For example,</p>

<p>&gt; complete cc p/*/f:*.[cao]/</p>

<p>completes cc arguments to files ending in only .c, .a,
or .o. select can also exclude files, using negation of a
glob- pattern as described under Filename substitution. One
might use</p>

<p>&gt; complete rm p/*/f:^*.{c,h,cc,C,tex,1,man,l,y}/</p>

<p>to exclude precious source code from rm completion. Of
course, one could still type excluded names manually or
over- ride the completion mechanism using the
complete-word-raw or list-choices-raw editor commands
(q.v.).</p>

<p>The C, D, F and T lists are like c, d, f and t
respectively, but they use the select argument in a
different way: to restrict completion to files beginning
with a particu- lar path prefix. For example, the Elm mail
program uses = as an abbreviation for one s mail directory.
One might use</p>

<p>&gt; complete elm c@=@F:$HOME/Mail/@</p>

<p>to complete elm -f = as if it were elm -f ~/Mail/. Note
that we used @ instead of / to avoid confusion with the
select argument, and we used $HOME instead of ~ because home
directory substitution works at only the beginning of a
word.</p>

<p>suffix is used to add a nonstandard suffix (not space or
/ for directories) to completed words.</p>

<p>&gt; complete finger c/*@/$hostnames/ p/1/u/@</p>

<p>completes arguments to finger from the list of users,
appends an @, and then completes after the @ from the
hostnames variable. Note again the order in which the
completions are specified.</p>

<p>Finally, heres a complex example for inspiration:</p>

<p>&gt; complete find n/-name/f/ n/-newer/f/ n/-{,n}cpio/f/
&acute;n/-exec/c/ n/-ok/c/ n/-user/u/ n/-group/g/
n/-fstype/(nfs 4.2)/ n/-type/(b c d f l p s)/
&acute;c/-/(name newer cpio ncpio exec ok user group fstype
type atime ctime depth inum ls mtime nogroup nouser perm
print prune size xdev)/ p/*/d/</p>

<p>This completes words following -name, -newer, -cpio or
ncpio (note the pattern which matches both) to files, words
following -exec or -ok to commands, words following user and
group to users and groups respectively and words follow- ing
-fstype or -type to members of the given lists. It also
completes the switches themselves from the given list (note
the use of c-type completion) and completes anything not
otherwise completed to a directory. Whew.</p>

<p>Remember that programmed completions are ignored if the
word being completed is a tilde substitution (beginning with
~) or a variable (beginning with $). complete is an
experimental feature, and the syntax may change in future
versions of the shell. See also the uncomplete builtin
command.</p>

<p>continue Continues execution of the nearest enclosing
while or foreach. The rest of the commands on the current
line are executed.</p>

<p>default: Labels the default case in a switch statement.
It should come after all case labels.</p>

<p>dirs [-l] [-n|-v] dirs -S|-L [filename] (+) dirs -c (+)
The first form prints the directory stack. The top of the
stack is at the left and the first directory in the stack is
the current directory. With -l, ~ or ~name in the output is
expanded explicitly to home or the pathname of the home
directory for user name. (+) With -n, entries are wrapped
before they reach the edge of the screen. (+) With -v,
entries are printed one per line, preceded by their stack
positions. (+) If more than one of -n or -v is given, -v
takes precedence. -p is accepted but does nothing.</p>

<p>With -S, the second form saves the directory stack to
filename as a series of cd and pushd commands. With -L, the
shell sources filename, which is presumably a directory
stack file saved by the -S option or the savedirs mechanism.
In either case, dirsfile is used if filename is not given
and ~/.cshdirs is used if dirsfile is unset.</p>

<p>Note that login shells do the equivalent of dirs -L on
startup and, if savedirs is set, dirs -S before exiting.
Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally sourced before
~/.cshdirs, dirsfile should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than
~/.login.</p>

<p>The last form clears the directory stack.</p>

<p>echo [-n] word ... Writes each word to the shells
standard output, separated by spaces and terminated with a
newline. The echo_style shell variable may be set to emulate
(or not) the flags and escape sequences of the BSD and/or
System V versions of echo; see echo(1).</p>

<p>echotc [-sv] arg ... (+) Exercises the terminal
capabilities (see termcap(5)) in args. For example, echotc
home sends the cursor to the home posi- tion, echotc cm 3 10
sends it to column 3 and row 10, and echotc ts 0; echo
&quot;This is a test.&quot;; echotc fs prints &quot;This is
a test.&quot; in the status line.</p>

<p>If arg is baud, cols, lines, meta or tabs, prints the
value of that capability (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;
indicating that the terminal does or does not have that
capability). One might use this to make the output from a
shell script less verbose on slow terminals, or limit
command output to the number of lines on the screen:</p>

<p>&gt; set history=echotc lines &gt; @ history--</p>

<p>Termcap strings may contain wildcards which will not
echo cor- rectly. One should use double quotes when setting
a shell variable to a terminal capability string, as in the
following example that places the date in the status
line:</p>

<p>&gt; set tosl=&quot;echotc ts 0&quot; &gt; set
frsl=&quot;echotc fs&quot; &gt; echo -n
&quot;$tosl&quot;;date; echo -n &quot;$frsl&quot;</p>

<p>With -s, nonexistent capabilities return the empty
string rather than causing an error. With -v, messages are
verbose.</p>

<p>else end endif endsw See the description of the foreach,
if, switch, and while statements below.</p>

<p>eval arg ... Treats the arguments as input to the shell
and executes the resulting command(s) in the context of the
current shell. This is usually used to execute commands
generated as the result of command or variable substitution,
because parsing occurs before these substitutions. See
tset(1) for a sample use of eval.</p>

<p>exec command Executes the specified command in place of
the current shell.</p>

<p>exit [expr] The shell exits either with the value of the
specified expr (an expression, as described under
Expressions) or, without expr, with the value 0.</p>

<p>fg [%job ...] Brings the specified jobs (or, without
arguments, the current job) into the foreground, continuing
each if it is stopped. job may be a number, a string, , %, +
or - as described under Jobs. See also the run-fg-editor
editor command.</p>

<p>filetest -op file ... (+) Applies op (which is a file
inquiry operator as described under File inquiry operators)
to each file and returns the results as a space-separated
list.</p>

<p>foreach name (wordlist) ... end Successively sets the
variable name to each member of wordlist and executes the
sequence of commands between this command and the matching
end. (Both foreach and end must appear alone on separate
lines.) The builtin command continue may be used to continue
the loop prematurely and the builtin command break to
terminate it prematurely. When this command is read from the
terminal, the loop is read once prompting with foreach? (or
prompt2) before any statements in the loop are executed. If
you make a mistake typing in a loop at the terminal you can
rub it out.</p>

<p>getspath (+) Prints the system execution path. (TCF
only)</p>

<p>getxvers (+) Prints the experimental version prefix.
(TCF only)</p>

<p>glob wordlist Like echo, but the -n parameter is not
recognized and words are delimited by null characters in the
output. Useful for programs which wish to use the shell to
filename expand a list of words.</p>

<p>goto word word is filename and command-substituted to
yield a string of the form label. The shell rewinds its
input as much as pos- sible, searches for a line of the form
label: , possibly pre- ceded by blanks or tabs, and
continues execution after that line.</p>

<p>hashstat Prints a statistics line indicating how
effective the internal hash table has been at locating
commands (and avoiding execs). An exec is attempted for each
component of the path where the hash function indicates a
possible hit, and in each component which does not begin
with a /.</p>

<p>On machines without vfork(2), prints only the number and
size of hash buckets.</p>

<p>history [-hTr] [n] history -S|-L|-M [filename] (+)
history -c (+) The first form prints the history event list.
If n is given only the n most recent events are printed or
saved. With -h, the history list is printed without leading
numbers. If -T is specified, timestamps are printed also in
comment form. (This can be used to produce files suitable
for loading with history -L or source -h.) With -r, the
order of printing is most recent first rather than oldest
first.</p>

<p>With -S, the second form saves the history list to
filename. If the first word of the savehist shell variable
is set to a number, at most that many lines are saved. If
the second word of savehist is set to merge, the history
list is merged with the existing history file instead of
replacing it (if there is one) and sorted by time stamp. (+)
Merging is intended for an environment like the X Window
System with several shells in simultaneous use. Currently it
succeeds only when the shells quit nicely one after
another.</p>

<p>With -L, the shell appends filename, which is presumably
a his- tory list saved by the -S option or the savehist
mechanism, to the history list. -M is like -L, but the
contents of filename are merged into the history list and
sorted by timestamp. In either case, histfile is used if
filename is not given and ~/.history is used if histfile is
unset. history -L is exactly like source -h except that it
does not require a filename.</p>

<p>Note that login shells do the equivalent of history -L
on startup and, if savehist is set, history -S before
exiting. Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally sourced before
~/.history, histfile should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than
~/.login.</p>

<p>If histlit is set, the first and second forms print and
save the literal (unexpanded) form of the history list.</p>

<p>The last form clears the history list.</p>

<p>hup [command] (+) With command, runs command such that
it will exit on a hangup signal and arranges for the shell
to send it a hangup signal when the shell exits. Note that
commands may set their own response to hangups, overriding
hup. Without an argument (allowed in only a shell script),
causes the shell to exit on a hangup for the remainder of
the script. See also Signal han- dling and the nohup builtin
command.</p>

<p>if (expr) command If expr (an expression, as described
under Expressions) evalu- ates true, then command is
executed. Variable substitution on command happens early, at
the same time it does for the rest of the if command.
command must be a simple command, not an alias, a pipeline,
a command list or a parenthesized command list, but it may
have arguments. Input/output redirection occurs even if expr
is false and command is thus not executed; this is a
bug.</p>

<p>if (expr) then ... else if (expr2) then ... else ...
endif If the specified expr is true then the commands to the
first else are executed; otherwise if expr2 is true then the
commands to the second else are executed, etc. Any number of
else-if pairs are possible; only one endif is needed. The
else part is likewise optional. (The words else and endif
must appear at the beginning of input lines; the if must
appear alone on its input line or after an else.)</p>

<p>inlib shared-library ... (+) Adds each shared-library to
the current environment. There is no way to remove a shared
library. (Domain/OS only)</p>

<p>jobs [-l] Lists the active jobs. With -l, lists process
IDs in addition to the normal information. On TCF systems,
prints the site on which each job is executing.</p>

<p>kill [-s signal] %job|pid ... kill -l The first and
second forms sends the specified signal (or, if none is
given, the TERM (terminate) signal) to the specified jobs or
processes. job may be a number, a string, , %, + or - as
described under Jobs. Signals are either given by number or
by name (as given in /usr/include/signal.h, stripped of the
prefix SIG). There is no default job; saying just kill does
not send a signal to the current job. If the sig- nal being
sent is TERM (terminate) or HUP (hangup), then the job or
process is sent a CONT (continue) signal as well. The third
form lists the signal names.</p>

<p>limit [-h] [resource [maximum-use]] Limits the
consumption by the current process and each process it
creates to not individually exceed maximum-use on the speci-
fied resource. If no maximum-use is given, then the current
limit is printed; if no resource is given, then all
limitations are given. If the -h flag is given, the hard
limits are used instead of the current limits. The hard
limits impose a ceil- ing on the values of the current
limits. Only the super-user may raise the hard limits, but a
user may lower or raise the current limits within the legal
range.</p>

<p>Controllable resources currently include (if supported
by the OS):</p>

<p>cputime the maximum number of cpu-seconds to be used by
each process</p>

<p>filesize the largest single file which can be
created</p>

<p>datasize the maximum growth of the data+stack region via
sbrk(2) beyond the end of the program text</p>

<p>stacksize the maximum size of the automatically-extended
stack region</p>

<p>coredumpsize the size of the largest core dump that will
be created</p>

<p>memoryuse the maximum amount of physical memory a
process may have allocated to it at a given time (this is
not implemented in the 2.6 kernel. The value is meaningless
and changing this value will have no effect)</p>

<p>heapsize the maximum amount of memory a process may
allocate per brk() system call</p>

<p>descriptors or openfiles the maximum number of open
files for this process</p>

<p>concurrency the maximum number of threads for this
process</p>

<p>memorylocked the maximum size which a process may lock
into memory using mlock(2)</p>

<p>maxproc the maximum number of simultaneous processes for
this user id</p>

<p>sbsize the maximum size of socket buffer usage for this
user</p>

<p>swapsize the maximum amount of swap space reserved or
used for this user</p>

<p>maximum-use may be given as a (floating point or
integer) num- ber followed by a scale factor. For all limits
other than cputime the default scale is k or kilobytes (1024
bytes); a scale factor of m or megabytes may also be used.
For cputime the default scaling is seconds, while m for
minutes or h for hours, or a time of the form mm:ss giving
minutes and seconds may be used.</p>

<p>For both resource names and scale factors, unambiguous
prefixes of the names suffice.</p>

<p>log (+) Prints the watch shell variable and reports on
each user indi- cated in watch who is logged in, regardless
of when they last logged in. See also watchlog.</p>

<p>login Terminates a login shell, replacing it with an
instance of /bin/login. This is one way to log off, included
for compati- bility with sh(1).</p>

<p>logout Terminates a login shell. Especially useful if
ignoreeof is set.</p>

<p>ls-F [-switch ...] [file ...] (+) Lists files like ls -F
, but much faster. It identifies each type of special file
in the listing with a special character:</p>

<p>/ Directory * Executable # Block device % Character
device | Named pipe (systems with named pipes only) = Socket
(systems with sockets only) @ Symbolic link (systems with
symbolic links only) + Hidden directory (AIX only) or
context dependent (HP/UX only) : Network special (HP/UX
only)</p>

<p>If the listlinks shell variable is set, symbolic links
are identified in more detail (on only systems that have
them, of course):</p>

<p>@ Symbolic link to a non-directory &gt; Symbolic link to
a directory &amp; Symbolic link to nowhere</p>

<p>listlinks also slows down ls-F and causes partitions
holding files pointed to by symbolic links to be
mounted.</p>

<p>If the listflags shell variable is set to x, a or A, or
any combination thereof (e.g., xA), they are used as flags
to ls-F, making it act like ls -xF, ls -Fa, ls -FA or a com-
bination (e.g., ls -FxA). On machines where ls -C is not the
default, ls-F acts like ls -CF , unless listflags contains
an x , in which case it acts like ls -xF. ls-F passes its
arguments to ls(1) if it is given any switches, so alias ls
ls-F generally does the right thing.</p>

<p>The ls-F builtin can list files using different colors
depend- ing on the filetype or extension. See the color tcsh
variable and the LS_COLORS environment variable.</p>

<p>migrate [-site] pid|%jobid ... (+) migrate -site (+) The
first form migrates the process or job to the site speci-
fied or the default site determined by the system path. The
second form is equivalent to migrate -site $$: it migrates
the current process to the specified site. Migrating the
shell itself can cause unexpected behavior, because the
shell does not like to lose its tty. (TCF only)</p>

<p>newgrp [-] group (+) Equivalent to exec newgrp ; see
newgrp(1). Available only if the shell was so compiled; see
the version shell variable.</p>

<p>nice [+number] [command] Sets the scheduling priority
for the shell to number, or, with- out number, to 4. With
command, runs command at the appropri- ate priority. The
greater the number, the less cpu the process gets. The
super-user may specify negative priority by using nice
-number .... Command is always executed in a sub-shell, and
the restrictions placed on commands in simple if statements
apply.</p>

<p>nohup [command] With command, runs command such that it
will ignore hangup sig- nals. Note that commands may set
their own response to hangups, overriding nohup. Without an
argument (allowed in only a shell script), causes the shell
to ignore hangups for the remainder of the script. See also
Signal handling and the hup builtin command.</p>

<p>notify [%job ...] Causes the shell to notify the user
asynchronously when the status of any of the specified jobs
(or, without %job, the cur- rent job) changes, instead of
waiting until the next prompt as is usual. job may be a
number, a string, , %, + or - as described under Jobs. See
also the notify shell variable.</p>

<p>onintr [-|label] Controls the action of the shell on
interrupts. Without argu- ments, restores the default action
of the shell on interrupts, which is to terminate shell
scripts or to return to the termi- nal command input level.
With -, causes all interrupts to be ignored. With label,
causes the shell to execute a goto label when an interrupt
is received or a child process termi- nates because it was
interrupted.</p>

<p>onintr is ignored if the shell is running detached and
in sys- tem startup files (see FILES), where interrupts are
disabled anyway.</p>

<p>popd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [+n] Without arguments, pops the
directory stack and returns to the new top directory. With a
number +n, discards the nth entry in the stack.</p>

<p>Finally, all forms of popd print the final directory
stack, just like dirs. The pushdsilent shell variable can be
set to prevent this and the -p flag can be given to override
pushdsi- lent. The -l, -n and -v flags have the same effect
on popd as on dirs. (+)</p>

<p>printenv [name] (+) Prints the names and values of all
environment variables or, with name, the value of the
environment variable name.</p>

<p>pushd [-p] [-l] [-n|-v] [name|+n] Without arguments,
exchanges the top two elements of the direc- tory stack. If
pushdtohome is set, pushd without arguments does pushd ~,
like cd. (+) With name, pushes the current working directory
onto the directory stack and changes to name. If name is -
it is interpreted as the previous working direc- tory (see
Filename substitution). (+) If dunique is set, pushd removes
any instances of name from the stack before pushing it onto
the stack. (+) With a number +n, rotates the nth ele- ment
of the directory stack around to be the top element and
changes to it. If dextract is set, however, pushd +n
extracts the nth directory, pushes it onto the top of the
stack and changes to it. (+)</p>

<p>Finally, all forms of pushd print the final directory
stack, just like dirs. The pushdsilent shell variable can be
set to prevent this and the -p flag can be given to override
pushdsi- lent. The -l, -n and -v flags have the same effect
on pushd as on dirs. (+)</p>

<p>rehash Causes the internal hash table of the contents of
the directo- ries in the path variable to be recomputed.
This is needed if new commands are added to directories in
path while you are logged in. This should be necessary only
if you add commands to one of your own directories, or if a
systems programmer changes the contents of one of the system
directories. Also flushes the cache of home directories
built by tilde expansion.</p>

<p>repeat count command The specified command, which is
subject to the same restric- tions as the command in the one
line if statement above, is executed count times. I/O
redirections occur exactly once, even if count is 0.</p>

<p>rootnode //nodename (+) Changes the rootnode to
//nodename, so that / will be inter- preted as //nodename.
(Domain/OS only)</p>

<p>sched (+) sched [+]hh:mm command (+) sched -n (+) The
first form prints the scheduled-event list. The sched shell
variable may be set to define the format in which the
scheduled-event list is printed. The second form adds
command to the scheduled-event list. For example,</p>

<p>&gt; sched 11:00 echo Its eleven oclock.</p>

<p>causes the shell to echo Its eleven oclock. at 11 AM.
The time may be in 12-hour AM/PM format</p>

<p>&gt; sched 5pm set prompt=[%h] Its after 5; go home:
&gt;</p>

<p>or may be relative to the current time:</p>

<p>&gt; sched +2:15 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother</p>

<p>A relative time specification may not use AM/PM format.
The third form removes item n from the event list:</p>

<p>&gt; sched 1 Wed Apr 4 15:42 /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1
-sother 2 Wed Apr 4 17:00 set prompt=[%h] Its after 5; go
home: &gt; &gt; sched -2 &gt; sched 1 Wed Apr 4 15:42
/usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sother</p>

<p>A command in the scheduled-event list is executed just
before the first prompt is printed after the time when the
command is scheduled. It is possible to miss the exact time
when the com- mand is to be run, but an overdue command will
execute at the next prompt. A command which comes due while
the shell is waiting for user input is executed immediately.
However, nor- mal operation of an already-running command
will not be inter- rupted so that a scheduled-event list
element may be run.</p>

<p>This mechanism is similar to, but not the same as, the
at(1) command on some Unix systems. Its major disadvantage
is that it may not run a command at exactly the specified
time. Its major advantage is that because sched runs
directly from the shell, it has access to shell variables
and other structures. This provides a mechanism for changing
one s working environ- ment based on the time of day.</p>

<p>set set name ... set name=word ... set [-r] [-f|-l]
name=(wordlist) ... (+) set name[index]=word ... set -r (+)
set -r name ... (+) set -r name=word ... (+) The first form
of the command prints the value of all shell variables.
Variables which contain more than a single word print as a
parenthesized word list. The second form sets name to the
null string. The third form sets name to the single word.
The fourth form sets name to the list of words in wordlist.
In all cases the value is command and filename expanded. If
-r is specified, the value is set read-only. If -f or -l are
specified, set only unique words keeping their order. -f
prefers the first occurrence of a word, and -l the last. The
fifth form sets the indexth component of name to word; this
component must already exist. The sixth form lists only the
names of all shell variables that are read-only. The seventh
form makes name read-only, whether or not it has a value.
The eighth form is the same as the third form, but make name
read-only at the same time.</p>

<p>These arguments can be repeated to set and/or make
read-only multiple variables in a single set command. Note,
however, that variable expansion happens for all arguments
before any setting occurs. Note also that = can be adjacent
to both name and word or separated from both by whitespace,
but cannot be adjacent to only one or the other. See also
the unset builtin command.</p>

<p>setenv [name [value]] Without arguments, prints the
names and values of all environ- ment variables. Given name,
sets the environment variable name to value or, without
value, to the null string.</p>

<p>setpath path (+) Equivalent to setpath(1). (Mach
only)</p>

<p>setspath LOCAL|site|cpu ... (+) Sets the system
execution path. (TCF only)</p>

<p>settc cap value (+) Tells the shell to believe that the
terminal capability cap (as defined in termcap(5)) has the
value value. No sanity checking is done. Concept terminal
users may have to settc xn no to get proper wrapping at the
rightmost column.</p>

<p>setty [-d|-q|-x] [-a] [[+|-]mode] (+) Controls which tty
modes (see Terminal management) the shell does not allow to
change. -d, -q or -x tells setty to act on the edit , quote
or execute set of tty modes respectively; without -d, -q or
-x, execute is used.</p>

<p>Without other arguments, setty lists the modes in the
chosen set which are fixed on (+mode) or off (-mode). The
avail- able modes, and thus the display, vary from system to
system. With -a, lists all tty modes in the chosen set
whether or not they are fixed. With +mode, -mode or mode,
fixes mode on or off or removes control from mode in the
chosen set. For exam- ple, setty +echok echoe fixes echok
mode on and allows com- mands to turn echoe mode on or off,
both when the shell is executing commands.</p>

<p>setxvers [string] (+) Set the experimental version
prefix to string, or removes it if string is omitted. (TCF
only)</p>

<p>shift [variable] Without arguments, discards argv[1] and
shifts the members of argv to the left. It is an error for
argv not to be set or to have less than one word as value.
With variable, performs the same function on variable.</p>

<p>source [-h] name [args ...] The shell reads and executes
commands from name. The commands are not placed on the
history list. If any args are given, they are placed in
argv. (+) source commands may be nested; if they are nested
too deeply the shell may run out of file descriptors. An
error in a source at any level terminates all nested source
commands. With -h, commands are placed on the history list
instead of being executed, much like history -L.</p>

<p>stop %job|pid ... Stops the specified jobs or processes
which are executing in the background. job may be a number,
a string, , %, + or - as described under Jobs. There is no
default job; saying just stop does not stop the current
job.</p>

<p>suspend Causes the shell to stop in its tracks, much as
if it had been sent a stop signal with ^Z. This is most
often used to stop shells started by su(1).</p>

<p>switch (string) case str1: ... breaksw ... default: ...
breaksw endsw Each case label is successively matched,
against the specified string which is first command and
filename expanded. The file metacharacters *, ? and [...]
may be used in the case labels, which are variable expanded.
If none of the labels match before a default label is found,
then the execution begins after the default label. Each case
label and the default label must appear at the beginning of
a line. The com- mand breaksw causes execution to continue
after the endsw. Otherwise control may fall through case
labels and default labels as in C. If no label matches and
there is no default, execution continues after the
endsw.</p>

<p>telltc (+) Lists the values of all terminal capabilities
(see termcap(5)).</p>

<p>termname [terminal type] (+) Tests if terminal type (or
the current value of TERM if no ter- minal type is given)
has an entry in the hosts termcap(5) or terminfo(5)
database. Prints the terminal type to stdout and returns 0
if an entry is present otherwise returns 1.</p>

<p>time [command] Executes command (which must be a simple
command, not an alias, a pipeline, a command list or a
parenthesized command list) and prints a time summary as
described under the time variable. If necessary, an extra
shell is created to print the time statis- tic when the
command completes. Without command, prints a time summary
for the current shell and its children.</p>

<p>umask [value] Sets the file creation mask to value,
which is given in octal. Common values for the mask are 002,
giving all access to the group and read and execute access
to others, and 022, giving read and execute access to the
group and others. Without value, prints the current file
creation mask.</p>

<p>unalias pattern Removes all aliases whose names match
pattern. unalias * thus removes all aliases. It is not an
error for nothing to be unaliased.</p>

<p>uncomplete pattern (+) Removes all completions whose
names match pattern. uncomplete * thus removes all
completions. It is not an error for noth- ing to be
uncompleted.</p>

<p>unhash Disables use of the internal hash table to speed
location of executed programs.</p>

<p>universe universe (+) Sets the universe to universe.
(Masscomp/RTU only)</p>

<p>unlimit [-hf] [resource] Removes the limitation on
resource or, if no resource is speci- fied, all resource
limitations. With -h, the corresponding hard limits are
removed. Only the super-user may do this. Note that unlimit
may not exit successful, since most systems do not allow
descriptors to be unlimited. With -f errors are ignored.</p>

<p>unset pattern Removes all variables whose names match
pattern, unless they are read-only. unset * thus removes all
variables unless they are read-only; this is a bad idea. It
is not an error for nothing to be unset.</p>

<p>unsetenv pattern Removes all environment variables whose
names match pattern. unsetenv * thus removes all environment
variables; this is a bad idea. It is not an error for
nothing to be unsetenved.</p>

<p>ver [systype [command]] (+) Without arguments, prints
SYSTYPE. With systype, sets SYSTYPE to systype. With systype
and command, executes command under systype. systype may be
bsd4.3 or sys5.3. (Domain/OS only)</p>

<p>wait The shell waits for all background jobs. If the
shell is interactive, an interrupt will disrupt the wait and
cause the shell to print the names and job numbers of all
outstanding jobs.</p>

<p>warp universe (+) Sets the universe to universe.
(Convex/OS only)</p>

<p>watchlog (+) An alternate name for the log builtin
command (q.v.). Avail- able only if the shell was so
compiled; see the version shell variable.</p>

<p>where command (+) Reports all known instances of
command, including aliases, builtins and executables in
path.</p>

<p>which command (+) Displays the command that will be
executed by the shell after substitutions, path searching,
etc. The builtin command is just like which(1), but it
correctly reports tcsh aliases and builtins and is 10 to 100
times faster. See also the which- command editor
command.</p>

<p>while (expr) ... end Executes the commands between the
while and the matching end while expr (an expression, as
described under Expressions) evaluates non-zero. while and
end must appear alone on their input lines. break and
continue may be used to terminate or continue the loop
prematurely. If the input is a terminal, the user is
prompted the first time through the loop as with fore-
ach.</p>

<p>Special aliases (+) If set, each of these aliases
executes automatically at the indicated time. They are all
initially undefined.</p>

<p>beepcmd Runs when the shell wants to ring the terminal
bell.</p>

<p>cwdcmd Runs after every change of working directory. For
example, if the user is working on an X window system using
xterm(1) and a re-parenting window manager that supports
title bars such as twm(1) and does</p>

<p>&gt; alias cwdcmd echo -n &quot;^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd
^G&quot;</p>

<p>then the shell will change the title of the running
xterm(1) to be the name of the host, a colon, and the full
current working directory. A fancier way to do that is</p>

<p>&gt; alias cwdcmd echo -n
&quot;^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^G&quot;</p>

<p>This will put the hostname and working directory on the
title bar but only the hostname in the icon manager
menu.</p>

<p>Note that putting a cd, pushd or popd in cwdcmd may
cause an infinite loop. It is the author s opinion that
anyone doing so will get what they deserve.</p>

<p>jobcmd Runs before each command gets executed, or when
the command changes state. This is similar to postcmd, but
it does not print builtins.</p>

<p>&gt; alias jobcmd echo -n &quot;^[]2;#:q^G&quot;</p>

<p>then executing vi foo.c will put the command string in
the xterm title bar.</p>

<p>helpcommand Invoked by the run-help editor command. The
command name for which help is sought is passed as sole
argument. For example, if one does</p>

<p>&gt; alias helpcommand :1 --help</p>

<p>then the help display of the command itself will be
invoked, using the GNU help calling convention. Currently
there is no easy way to account for various calling
conventions (e.g., the customary Unix -h ), except by using
a table of many commands.</p>

<p>periodic Runs every tperiod minutes. This provides a
convenient means for checking on common but infrequent
changes such as new mail. For example, if one does</p>

<p>&gt; set tperiod = 30 &gt; alias periodic checknews</p>

<p>then the checknews(1) program runs every 30 minutes. If
peri- odic is set but tperiod is unset or set to 0, periodic
behaves like precmd.</p>

<p>precmd Runs just before each prompt is printed. For
example, if one does</p>

<p>&gt; alias precmd date</p>

<p>then date(1) runs just before the shell prompts for each
com- mand. There are no limits on what precmd can be set to
do, but discretion should be used.</p>

<p>postcmd Runs before each command gets executed.</p>

<p>&gt; alias postcmd echo -n &quot;^[]2;#:q^G&quot;</p>

<p>then executing vi foo.c will put the command string in
the xterm title bar.</p>

<p>shell Specifies the interpreter for executable scripts
which do not themselves specify an interpreter. The first
word should be a full path name to the desired interpreter
(e.g., /bin/csh or /usr/local/bin/tcsh).</p>

<p>Special shell variables The variables described in this
section have special meaning to the shell.</p>

<p>The shell sets addsuffix, argv, autologout, csubstnonl,
command, echo_style, edit, gid, group, home, loginsh, oid,
path, prompt, prompt2, prompt3, shell, shlvl, tcsh, term,
tty, uid, user and version at startup; they do not change
thereafter unless changed by the user. The shell updates
cwd, dirstack, owd and status when necessary, and sets
logout on logout.</p>

<p>The shell synchronizes group, home, path, shlvl, term
and user with the environment variables of the same names:
whenever the environment vari- able changes the shell
changes the corresponding shell variable to match (unless
the shell variable is read-only) and vice versa. Note that
although cwd and PWD have identical meanings, they are not
syn- chronized in this manner, and that the shell
automatically intercon- verts the different formats of path
and PATH.</p>

<p>addsuffix (+) If set, filename completion adds / to the
end of directories and a space to the end of normal files
when they are matched exactly. Set by default.</p>

<p>afsuser (+) If set, autologout s autolock feature uses
its value instead of the local username for kerberos
authentication.</p>

<p>ampm (+) If set, all times are shown in 12-hour AM/PM
format.</p>

<p>anyerror (+) This variable selects what is propagated to
the value of the status variable. For more information see
the description of the status variable below.</p>

<p>argv The arguments to the shell. Positional parameters
are taken from argv, i.e., $1 is replaced by $argv[1], etc.
Set by default, but usually empty in interactive shells.</p>

<p>autocorrect (+) If set, the spell-word editor command is
invoked automatically before each completion attempt.</p>

<p>autoexpand (+) If set, the expand-history editor command
is invoked automati- cally before each completion attempt.
If this is set to only- history, then only history will be
expanded and a second com- pletion will expand
filenames.</p>

<p>autolist (+) If set, possibilities are listed after an
ambiguous completion. If set to ambiguous , possibilities
are listed only when no new characters are added by
completion.</p>

<p>autologout (+) The first word is the number of minutes
of inactivity before automatic logout. The optional second
word is the number of minutes of inactivity before automatic
locking. When the shell automatically logs out, it prints
auto-logout, sets the vari- able logout to automatic and
exits. When the shell automati- cally locks, the user is
required to enter his password to con- tinue working. Five
incorrect attempts result in automatic logout. Set to 60
(automatic logout after 60 minutes, and no locking) by
default in login and superuser shells, but not if the shell
thinks it is running under a window system (i.e., the
DISPLAY environment variable is set), the tty is a
pseudo-tty (pty) or the shell was not so compiled (see the
version shell variable). See also the afsuser and logout
shell variables.</p>

<p>backslash_quote (+) If set, backslashes ( ) always quote
, , and &quot;. This may make complex quoting tasks easier,
but it can cause syntax errors in csh(1) scripts.</p>

<p>catalog The file name of the message catalog. If set,
tcsh use tcsh.${catalog} as a message catalog instead of
default tcsh.</p>

<p>cdpath A list of directories in which cd should search
for subdirecto- ries if they arent found in the current
directory.</p>

<p>color If set, it enables color display for the builtin
ls-F and it passes --color=auto to ls. Alternatively, it can
be set to only ls-F or only ls to enable color to only one
command. Set- ting it to nothing is equivalent to setting it
to (ls-F ls).</p>

<p>colorcat If set, it enables color escape sequence for
NLS message files. And display colorful NLS messages.</p>

<p>command (+) If set, the command which was passed to the
shell with the -c flag (q.v.).</p>

<p>compat_expr (+) If set, the shell will evaluate
expressions right to left, like the original csh.</p>

<p>complete (+) If set to enhance, completion 1) ignores
case and 2) consid- ers periods, hyphens and underscores (.,
- and _ ) to be word separators and hyphens and underscores
to be equivalent. If set to igncase, the completion becomes
case insensitive.</p>

<p>continue (+) If set to a list of commands, the shell
will continue the listed commands, instead of starting a new
one.</p>

<p>continue_args (+) Same as continue, but the shell will
execute:</p>

<p>echo pwd $argv &gt; ~/.&lt;cmd&gt;_pause;
%&lt;cmd&gt;</p>

<p>correct (+) If set to cmd , commands are automatically
spelling-corrected. If set to complete , commands are
automatically completed. If set to all, the entire command
line is corrected.</p>

<p>csubstnonl (+) If set, newlines and carriage returns in
command substitution are replaced by spaces. Set by
default.</p>

<p>cwd The full pathname of the current directory. See also
the dirstack and owd shell variables.</p>

<p>dextract (+) If set, pushd +n extracts the nth directory
from the direc- tory stack rather than rotating it to the
top.</p>

<p>dirsfile (+) The default location in which dirs -S and
dirs -L look for a history file. If unset, ~/.cshdirs is
used. Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally sourced before
~/.cshdirs, dirsfile should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than
~/.login.</p>

<p>dirstack (+) An array of all the directories on the
directory stack. $dirstack[1] is the current working
directory, $dirstack[2] the first directory on the stack,
etc. Note that the current working directory is $dirstack[1]
but =0 in directory stack substitutions, etc. One can change
the stack arbitrarily by setting dirstack, but the first
element (the current working directory) is always correct.
See also the cwd and owd shell variables.</p>

<p>dspmbyte (+) Has an affect iff dspm is listed as part of
the version shell variable. If set to euc, it enables
display and editing EUC- kanji(Japanese) code. If set to
sjis, it enables display and editing Shift-JIS(Japanese)
code. If set to big5, it enables display and editing
Big5(Chinese) code. If set to utf8, it enables display and
editing Utf8(Unicode) code. If set to the following format,
it enables display and editing of original multi-byte code
format:</p>

<p>&gt; set dspmbyte = 0000....(256 bytes)....0000</p>

<p>The table requires just 256 bytes. Each character of 256
char- acters corresponds (from left to right) to the ASCII
codes 0x00, 0x01, ... 0xff. Each character is set to number
0,1,2 and 3. Each number has the following meaning: 0 ...
not used for multi-byte characters. 1 ... used for the first
byte of a multi-byte character. 2 ... used for the second
byte of a multi-byte character. 3 ... used for both the
first byte and second byte of a multi-byte character.</p>

<p>Example: If set to 001322, the first character (means
0x00 of the ASCII code) and second character (means 0x01 of
ASCII code) are set to 0. Then, it is not used for
multi-byte characters. The 3rd character (0x02) is set to 1,
indicating that it is used for the first byte of a
multi-byte character. The 4th character(0x03) is set 3. It
is used for both the first byte and the second byte of a
multi-byte character. The 5th and 6th characters (0x04,0x05)
are set to 2, indicating that they are used for the second
byte of a multi-byte character.</p>

<p>The GNU fileutils version of ls cannot display
multi-byte file- names without the -N ( --literal ) option.
If you are using this version, set the second word of
dspmbyte to &quot;ls&quot;. If not, for example, &quot;ls-F
-l&quot; cannot display multi-byte filenames.</p>

<p>Note: This variable can only be used if KANJI and
DSPMBYTE has been defined at compile time.</p>

<p>dunique (+) If set, pushd removes any instances of name
from the stack before pushing it onto the stack.</p>

<p>echo If set, each command with its arguments is echoed
just before it is executed. For non-builtin commands all
expansions occur before echoing. Builtin commands are echoed
before command and filename substitution, because these
substitutions are then done selectively. Set by the -x
command line option.</p>

<p>echo_style (+) The style of the echo builtin. May be set
to</p>

<p>bsd Dont echo a newline if the first argument is -n.
sysv Recognize backslashed escape sequences in echo strings.
both Recognize both the -n flag and backslashed escape
sequences; the default. none Recognize neither.</p>

<p>Set by default to the local system default. The BSD and
System V options are described in the echo(1) man pages on
the appro- priate systems.</p>

<p>edit (+) If set, the command-line editor is used. Set by
default in interactive shells.</p>

<p>ellipsis (+) If set, the %c/%. and %C prompt sequences
(see the prompt shell variable) indicate skipped directories
with an ellipsis (...) instead of /&lt;skipped&gt;.</p>

<p>fignore (+) Lists file name suffixes to be ignored by
completion.</p>

<p>filec In tcsh, completion is always used and this
variable is ignored by default. If edit is unset, then the
traditional csh completion is used. If set in csh, filename
completion is used.</p>

<p>gid (+) The users real group ID.</p>

<p>group (+) The users group name.</p>

<p>highlight If set, the incremental search match (in
i-search-back and i- search-fwd) and the region between the
mark and the cursor are highlighted in reverse video.</p>

<p>Highlighting requires more frequent terminal writes,
which introduces extra overhead. If you care about terminal
perfor- mance, you may want to leave this unset.</p>

<p>histchars A string value determining the characters used
in History sub- stitution (q.v.). The first character of its
value is used as the history substitution character,
replacing the default char- acter ! . The second character
of its value replaces the character ^ in quick
substitutions.</p>

<p>histdup (+) Controls handling of duplicate entries in
the history list. If set to all only unique history events
are entered in the his- tory list. If set to prev and the
last history event is the same as the current command, then
the current command is not entered in the history. If set to
erase and the same event is found in the history list, that
old event gets erased and the current one gets inserted.
Note that the prev and all options renumber history events
so there are no gaps.</p>

<p>histfile (+) The default location in which history -S
and history -L look for a history file. If unset, ~/.history
is used. hist- file is useful when sharing the same home
directory between different machines, or when saving
separate histories on dif- ferent terminals. Because only
~/.tcshrc is normally sourced before ~/.history, histfile
should be set in ~/.tcshrc rather than ~/.login.</p>

<p>histlit (+) If set, builtin and editor commands and the
savehist mechanism use the literal (unexpanded) form of
lines in the history list. See also the
toggle-literal-history editor command.</p>

<p>history The first word indicates the number of history
events to save. The optional second word (+) indicates the
format in which his- is used. The tory is printed; if not
given, %h%T%R0 format sequences are described below under
prompt; note the variable meaning of %R. Set to 100 by
default.</p>

<p>home Initialized to the home directory of the invoker.
The filename expansion of ~ refers to this variable.</p>

<p>ignoreeof If set to the empty string or 0 and the input
device is a terminal, the end-of-file command (usually
generated by the user by typing ^D on an empty line) causes
the shell to print Use &quot;exit&quot; to leave tcsh.
instead of exiting. This prevents the shell from
accidentally being killed. Historically this setting exited
after 26 successive EOF s to avoid infinite loops. If set to
a number n, the shell ignores n - 1 consecu- tive
end-of-files and exits on the nth. (+) If unset, 1 is used,
i.e., the shell exits on a single ^D.</p>

<p>implicitcd (+) If set, the shell treats a directory name
typed as a command as though it were a request to change to
that directory. If set to verbose, the change of directory
is echoed to the standard output. This behavior is inhibited
in non-interactive shell scripts, or for command strings
with more than one word. Changing directory takes precedence
over executing a like-named command, but it is done after
alias substitutions. Tilde and variable expansions work as
expected.</p>

<p>inputmode (+) If set to insert or overwrite, puts the
editor into that input mode at the beginning of each
line.</p>

<p>killdup (+) Controls handling of duplicate entries in
the kill ring. If set to all only unique strings are entered
in the kill ring. If set to prev and the last killed string
is the same as the current killed string, then the current
string is not entered in the ring. If set to erase and the
same string is found in the kill ring, the old string is
erased and the current one is inserted.</p>

<p>killring (+) Indicates the number of killed strings to
keep in memory. Set to 30 by default. If unset or set to
less than 2, the shell will only keep the most recently
killed string. Strings are put in the killring by the editor
commands that delete (kill) strings of text, e.g.
backward-delete-word, kill-line, etc, as well as the
copy-region-as-kill command. The yank edi- tor command will
yank the most recently killed string into the command-line,
while yank-pop (see Editor commands) can be used to yank
earlier killed strings.</p>

<p>listflags (+) If set to x, a or A, or any combination
thereof (e.g., xA), they are used as flags to ls-F, making
it act like ls -xF , ls -Fa, ls -FA or a combination (e.g.,
ls -FxA): a shows all files (even if they start with a .), A
shows all files but . and .., and x sorts across instead of
down. If the second word of listflags is set, it is used as
the path to ls(1).</p>

<p>listjobs (+) If set, all jobs are listed when a job is
suspended. If set to long, the listing is in long
format.</p>

<p>listlinks (+) If set, the ls-F builtin command shows the
type of file to which each symbolic link points.</p>

<p>listmax (+) The maximum number of items which the
list-choices editor com- mand will list without asking
first.</p>

<p>listmaxrows (+) The maximum number of rows of items
which the list-choices edi- tor command will list without
asking first.</p>

<p>loginsh (+) Set by the shell if it is a login shell.
Setting or unsetting it within a shell has no effect. See
also shlvl.</p>

<p>logout (+) Set by the shell to normal before a normal
logout, auto- matic before an automatic logout, and hangup
if the shell was killed by a hangup signal (see Signal
handling). See also the autologout shell variable.</p>

<p>mail The names of the files or directories to check for
incoming mail, separated by whitespace, and optionally
preceded by a numeric word. Before each prompt, if 10
minutes have passed since the last check, the shell checks
each file and says You have new mail. (or, if mail contains
multiple files, You have new mail in name. ) if the filesize
is greater than zero in size and has a modification time
greater than its access time.</p>

<p>If you are in a login shell, then no mail file is
reported unless it has been modified after the time the
shell has started up, to prevent redundant notifications.
Most login programs will tell you whether or not you have
mail when you log in.</p>

<p>If a file specified in mail is a directory, the shell
will count each file within that directory as a separate
message, and will report You have n mails. or You have n
mails in name. as appropriate. This functionality is
provided primar- ily for those systems which store mail in
this manner, such as the Andrew Mail System.</p>

<p>If the first word of mail is numeric it is taken as a
different mail checking interval, in seconds.</p>

<p>Under very rare circumstances, the shell may report You
have mail. instead of You have new mail.</p>

<p>matchbeep (+) If set to never, completion never beeps.
If set to nomatch , it beeps only when there is no match. If
set to ambiguous, it beeps when there are multiple matches.
If set to notunique, it beeps when there is one exact and
other longer matches. If unset, ambiguous is used.</p>

<p>nobeep (+) If set, beeping is completely disabled. See
also visiblebell.</p>

<p>noclobber If set, restrictions are placed on output
redirection to insure that files are not accidentally
destroyed and that &gt;&gt; redirections refer to existing
files, as described in the Input/output section.</p>

<p>noding If set, disable the printing of DING! in the
prompt time specifiers at the change of hour.</p>

<p>noglob If set, Filename substitution and Directory stack
substitution (q.v.) are inhibited. This is most useful in
shell scripts which do not deal with filenames, or after a
list of filenames has been obtained and further expansions
are not desirable.</p>

<p>nokanji (+) If set and the shell supports Kanji (see the
version shell variable), it is disabled so that the meta key
can be used.</p>

<p>nonomatch If set, a Filename substitution or Directory
stack substitution (q.v.) which does not match any existing
files is left untouched rather than causing an error. It is
still an error for the substitution to be malformed, e.g.,
echo [ still gives an error.</p>

<p>nostat (+) A list of directories (or glob-patterns which
match directo- ries; see Filename substitution) that should
not be stat(2)ed during a completion operation. This is
usually used to exclude directories which take too much time
to stat(2), for example /afs.</p>

<p>notify If set, the shell announces job completions
asynchronously. The default is to present job completions
just before printing a prompt.</p>

<p>oid (+) The users real organization ID. (Domain/OS
only)</p>

<p>owd (+) The old working directory, equivalent to the -
used by cd and pushd. See also the cwd and dirstack shell
variables.</p>

<p>padhour If set, enable the printing of padding 0 for
hours, in 24 and 12 hour formats. E.G.: 07:45:42 vs.
7:45:42</p>

<p>path A list of directories in which to look for
executable commands. A null word specifies the current
directory. If there is no path variable then only full path
names will execute. path is set by the shell at startup from
the PATH environment variable or, if PATH does not exist, to
a system-dependent default some- thing like (/usr/local/bin
/usr/bsd /bin /usr/bin .). The shell may put . first or last
in path or omit it entirely depending on how it was
compiled; see the version shell vari- able. A shell which is
given neither the -c nor the -t option hashes the contents
of the directories in path after reading ~/.tcshrc and each
time path is reset. If one adds a new com- mand to a
directory in path while the shell is active, one may need to
do a rehash for the shell to find it.</p>

<p>printexitvalue (+) If set and an interactive program
exits with a non-zero status, the shell prints Exit
status.</p>

<p>prompt The string which is printed before reading each
command from the terminal. prompt may include any of the
following format- ting sequences (+), which are replaced by
the given informa- tion:</p>

<p>%/ The current working directory. %~ The current working
directory, but with one s home direc- tory represented by ~
and other users home directories represented by ~user as per
Filename substitution. ~user substitution happens only if
the shell has already used ~user in a pathname in the
current session. %c[[0]n], %.[[0]n] The trailing component
of the current working directory, or n trailing components
if a digit n is given. If n begins with 0 , the number of
skipped components precede the trailing component(s) in the
format /&lt;skipped&gt;trailing. If the ellipsis shell
variable is set, skipped components are represented by an
ellipsis so the whole becomes ...trailing . ~ substitution
is done as in %~ above, but the ~ component is ignored when
counting trailing components. %C Like %c, but without ~
substitution. %h, %!, ! The current history event number. %M
The full hostname. %m The hostname up to the first .. %S
(%s) Start (stop) standout mode. %B (%b) Start (stop)
boldfacing mode. %U (%u) Start (stop) underline mode. %t, %@
The time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format. %T Like %t, but in
24-hour format (but see the ampm shell variable). %p The
precise time of day in 12-hour AM/PM format, with seconds.
%P Like %p, but in 24-hour format (but see the ampm shell
variable). c c is parsed as in bindkey. ^c c is parsed as in
bindkey. %% A single %. %n The user name. %j The number of
jobs. %d The weekday in Day format. %D The day in dd format.
%w The month in Mon format. %W The month in mm format. %y
The year in yy format. %Y The year in yyyy format. %l The
shells tty. %L Clears from the end of the prompt to end of
the display or the end of the line. %$ Expands the shell or
environment variable name immediately after the $. %# &gt;
(or the first character of the promptchars shell vari- able)
for normal users, # (or the second character of promptchars)
for the superuser. %{string%} Includes string as a literal
escape sequence. It should be used only to change terminal
attributes and should not move the cursor location. This
cannot be the last sequence in prompt. %? The return code of
the command executed just before the prompt. %R In prompt2,
the status of the parser. In prompt3, the cor- rected
string. In history, the history string.</p>

<p>%B, %S, %U and %{string%} are available in only eight-
bit-clean shells; see the version shell variable.</p>

<p>The bold, standout and underline sequences are often
used to distinguish a superuser shell. For example,</p>

<p>&gt; set prompt = &quot;%m [%h] %B[%@]%b [%/] you rang?
&quot; tut [37] [2:54pm] [/usr/accts/sys] you rang? _</p>

<p>If %t, %@, %T, %p, or %P is used, and noding is not set,
then print DING! on the change of hour (i.e, :00 min- utes)
instead of the actual time.</p>

<p>Set by default to %# in interactive shells.</p>

<p>prompt2 (+) The string with which to prompt in while and
foreach loops and after lines ending in . The same format
sequences may be used as in prompt (q.v.); note the variable
meaning of %R. Set by default to %R? in interactive
shells.</p>

<p>prompt3 (+) The string with which to prompt when
confirming automatic spelling correction. The same format
sequences may be used as in prompt (q.v.); note the variable
meaning of %R. Set by default to CORRECT&gt;%R (y|n|e|a)? in
interactive shells.</p>

<p>promptchars (+) If set (to a two-character string), the
%# formatting sequence in the prompt shell variable is
replaced with the first character for normal users and the
second character for the superuser.</p>

<p>pushdtohome (+) If set, pushd without arguments does
pushd ~, like cd.</p>

<p>pushdsilent (+) If set, pushd and popd do not print the
directory stack.</p>

<p>recexact (+) If set, completion completes on an exact
match even if a longer match is possible.</p>

<p>recognize_only_executables (+) If set, command listing
displays only files in the path that are executable.
Slow.</p>

<p>rmstar (+) If set, the user is prompted before rm * is
executed.</p>

<p>rprompt (+) The string to print on the right-hand side
of the screen (after the command input) when the prompt is
being displayed on the left. It recognizes the same
formatting characters as prompt. It will automatically
disappear and reappear as necessary, to ensure that command
input isnt obscured, and will appear only if the prompt,
command input, and itself will fit together on the first
line. If edit isn t set, then rprompt will be printed after
the prompt and before the command input.</p>

<p>savedirs (+) If set, the shell does dirs -S before
exiting. If the first word is set to a number, at most that
many directory stack entries are saved.</p>

<p>savehist If set, the shell does history -S before
exiting. If the first word is set to a number, at most that
many lines are saved. (The number must be less than or equal
to history.) If the second word is set to merge, the history
list is merged with the existing history file instead of
replacing it (if there is one) and sorted by time stamp and
the most recent events are retained. (+)</p>

<p>sched (+) The format in which the sched builtin command
prints scheduled is used. The format events; if not given,
%h%T%R0 sequences are described above under prompt; note the
variable meaning of %R.</p>

<p>shell The file in which the shell resides. This is used
in forking shells to interpret files which have execute bits
set, but which are not executable by the system. (See the
description of Builtin and non-builtin command execution.)
Initialized to the (system-dependent) home of the shell.</p>

<p>shlvl (+) The number of nested shells. Reset to 1 in
login shells. See also loginsh.</p>

<p>status The exit status from the last command or
backquote expansion, or any command in a pipeline is
propagated to status. (This is also the default csh
behavior.) This default does not match what POSIX mandates
(to return the status of the last command only). To match
the POSIX behavior, you need to unset anyerror.</p>

<p>If the anyerror variable is unset, the exit status of a
pipeline is determined only from the last command in the
pipeline, and the exit status of a backquote expansion is
not propagated to status.</p>

<p>If a command terminated abnormally, then 0200 is added
to the status. Builtin commands which fail return exit
status 1, all other builtin commands return status 0.</p>

<p>symlinks (+) Can be set to several different values to
control symbolic link (symlink) resolution:</p>

<p>If set to chase, whenever the current directory changes
to a directory containing a symbolic link, it is expanded to
the real name of the directory to which the link points.
This does not work for the users home directory; this is a
bug.</p>

<p>If set to ignore, the shell tries to construct a current
directory relative to the current directory before the link
was crossed. This means that cding through a symbolic link
and then cd .. ing returns one to the original directory.
This affects only builtin commands and filename
completion.</p>

<p>If set to expand, the shell tries to fix symbolic links
by actually expanding arguments which look like path names.
This affects any command, not just builtins. Unfortunately,
this does not work for hard-to-recognize filenames, such as
those embedded in command options. Expansion may be
prevented by quoting. While this setting is usually the most
convenient, it is sometimes misleading and sometimes
confusing when it fails to recognize an argument which
should be expanded. A compro- mise is to use ignore and use
the editor command normalize- path (bound by default to
^X-n) when necessary.</p>

<p>Some examples are in order. First, lets set up some play
directories:</p>

<p>&gt; cd /tmp &gt; mkdir from from/src to &gt; ln -s
from/src to/dst</p>

<p>Heres the behavior with symlinks unset,</p>

<p>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd /tmp/to/dst &gt; cd ..;
echo $cwd /tmp/from</p>

<p>heres the behavior with symlinks set to chase,</p>

<p>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd /tmp/from/src &gt; cd ..;
echo $cwd /tmp/from</p>

<p>heres the behavior with symlinks set to ignore,</p>

<p>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd /tmp/to/dst &gt; cd ..;
echo $cwd /tmp/to</p>

<p>and heres the behavior with symlinks set to expand .</p>

<p>&gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd /tmp/to/dst &gt; cd ..;
echo $cwd /tmp/to &gt; cd /tmp/to/dst; echo $cwd /tmp/to/dst
&gt; cd &quot;..&quot;; echo $cwd /tmp/from &gt; /bin/echo
.. /tmp/to &gt; /bin/echo &quot;..&quot; ..</p>

<p>Note that expand expansion 1) works just like ignore for
builtins like cd, 2) is prevented by quoting, and 3) happens
before filenames are passed to non-builtin commands.</p>

<p>tcsh (+) The version number of the shell in the format
R.VV.PP, where R is the major release number, VV the current
version and PP the patchlevel.</p>

<p>term The terminal type. Usually set in ~/.login as
described under Startup and shutdown.</p>

<p>time If set to a number, then the time builtin (q.v.)
executes auto- matically after each command which takes more
than that many CPU seconds. If there is a second word, it is
used as a format string for the output of the time builtin.
(u) The following sequences may be used in the format
string:</p>

<p>%U The time the process spent in user mode in cpu
seconds. %S The time the process spent in kernel mode in cpu
seconds. %E The elapsed (wall clock) time in seconds. %P The
CPU percentage computed as (%U + %S) / %E. %W Number of
times the process was swapped. %X The average amount in
(shared) text space used in Kbytes. %D The average amount in
(unshared) data/stack space used in Kbytes. %K The total
space used (%X + %D) in Kbytes. %M The maximum memory the
process had in use at any time in Kbytes. %F The number of
major page faults (page needed to be brought from disk). %R
The number of minor page faults. %I The number of input
operations. %O The number of output operations. %r The
number of socket messages received. %s The number of socket
messages sent. %k The number of signals received. %w The
number of voluntary context switches (waits). %c The number
of involuntary context switches.</p>

<p>Only the first four sequences are supported on systems
without BSD resource limit functions. The default time
format is %Uu %Ss %E %P %X+%Dk %I+%Oio %Fpf+%Ww for systems
that support resource usage reporting and %Uu %Ss %E %P for
systems that do not.</p>

<p>Under Sequents DYNIX/ptx, %X, %D, %K, %r and %s are not
avail- able, but the following additional sequences are:</p>

<p>%Y The number of system calls performed. %Z The number
of pages which are zero-filled on demand. %i The number of
times a processs resident set size was increased by the
kernel. %d The number of times a processs resident set size
was decreased by the kernel. %l The number of read system
calls performed. %m The number of write system calls
performed. %p The number of reads from raw disk devices. %q
The number of writes to raw disk devices.</p>

<p>and the default time format is %Uu %Ss %E %P %I+%Oio
%Fpf+%Ww . Note that the CPU percentage can be higher than
100% on multi-processors.</p>

<p>tperiod (+) The period, in minutes, between executions
of the periodic spe- cial alias.</p>

<p>tty (+) The name of the tty, or empty if not attached to
one.</p>

<p>uid (+) The users real user ID.</p>

<p>user The users login name.</p>

<p>verbose If set, causes the words of each command to be
printed, after history substitution (if any). Set by the -v
command line option.</p>

<p>version (+) The version ID stamp. It contains the shell
s version number (see tcsh), origin, release date, vendor,
operating system and machine (see VENDOR, OSTYPE and
MACHTYPE) and a comma-separated list of options which were
set at compile time. Options which are set by default in the
distribution are noted.</p>

<p>8b The shell is eight bit clean; default 7b The shell is
not eight bit clean wide The shell is multibyte encoding
clean (like UTF-8) nls The systems NLS is used; default for
systems with NLS lf Login shells execute /etc/csh.login
before instead of after /etc/csh.cshrc and ~/.login before
instead of after ~/.tcshrc and ~/.history. dl . is put last
in path for security; default nd . is omitted from path for
security vi vi-style editing is the default rather than
emacs dtr Login shells drop DTR when exiting bye bye is a
synonym for logout and log is an alternate name for watchlog
al autologout is enabled; default kan Kanji is used if
appropriate according to locale set- tings, unless the
nokanji shell variable is set sm The systems malloc(3) is
used hb The #!&lt;program&gt; &lt;args&gt; convention is
emulated when exe- cuting shell scripts ng The newgrp
builtin is available rh The shell attempts to set the
REMOTEHOST environment variable afs The shell verifies your
password with the kerberos server if local authentication
fails. The afsuser shell vari- able or the AFSUSER
environment variable override your local username if
set.</p>

<p>An administrator may enter additional strings to
indicate dif- ferences in the local version.</p>

<p>visiblebell (+) If set, a screen flash is used rather
than the audible bell. See also nobeep.</p>

<p>watch (+) A list of user/terminal pairs to watch for
logins and logouts. If either the user is any all terminals
are watched for the given user and vice versa. Setting watch
to (any any) watches all users and terminals. For
example,</p>

<p>set watch = (george ttyd1 any console $user any)</p>

<p>reports activity of the user george on ttyd1, any user
on the console, and oneself (or a trespasser) on any
terminal.</p>

<p>Logins and logouts are checked every 10 minutes by
default, but the first word of watch can be set to a number
to check every so many minutes. For example,</p>

<p>set watch = (1 any any)</p>

<p>reports any login/logout once every minute. For the
impatient, the log builtin command triggers a watch report
at any time. All current logins are reported (as with the
log builtin) when watch is first set.</p>

<p>The who shell variable controls the format of watch
reports.</p>

<p>who (+) The format string for watch messages. The
following sequences are replaced by the given
information:</p>

<p>%n The name of the user who logged in/out. %a The
observed action, i.e., logged on, logged off or replaced
olduser on. %l The terminal (tty) on which the user logged
in/out. %M The full hostname of the remote host, or local if
the login/logout was from the local host. %m The hostname of
the remote host up to the first .. The full name is printed
if it is an IP address or an X Window System display.</p>

<p>%M and %m are available on only systems that store the
remote hostname in /etc/utmp. If unset, %n has %a %l from
%m. is used, or %n has %a %l. on systems which dont store
the remote hostname.</p>

<p>wordchars (+) A list of non-alphanumeric characters to
be considered part of a word by the forward-word,
backward-word etc., editor com- mands. If unset, *?_-.[]~=
is used.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT AFSUSER (+) Equivalent to the afsuser shell
variable.</p>

<p>COLUMNS The number of columns in the terminal. See
Terminal manage- ment.</p>

<p>DISPLAY Used by X Window System (see X(1)). If set, the
shell does not set autologout (q.v.).</p>

<p>EDITOR The pathname to a default editor. See also the
VISUAL environ- ment variable and the run-fg-editor editor
command.</p>

<p>GROUP (+) Equivalent to the group shell variable.</p>

<p>HOME Equivalent to the home shell variable.</p>

<p>HOST (+) Initialized to the name of the machine on which
the shell is running, as determined by the gethostname(2)
system call.</p>

<p>HOSTTYPE (+) Initialized to the type of machine on which
the shell is run- ning, as determined at compile time. This
variable is obsolete and will be removed in a future
version.</p>

<p>HPATH (+) A colon-separated list of directories in which
the run-help editor command looks for command
documentation.</p>

<p>LANG Gives the preferred character environment. See
Native Language System support.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE If set, only ctype character handling is
changed. See Native Language System support.</p>

<p>LINES The number of lines in the terminal. See Terminal
management.</p>

<p>LS_COLORS The format of this variable is reminiscent of
the termcap(5) file format; a colon-separated list of
expressions of the form &quot;xx=string&quot;, where
&quot;xx&quot; is a two-character variable name. The
variables with their associated defaults are:</p>

<p>no 0 Normal (non-filename) text fi 0 Regular file di
01;34 Directory ln 01;36 Symbolic link pi 33 Named pipe
(FIFO) so 01;35 Socket do 01;35 Door bd 01;33 Block device
cd 01;32 Character device ex 01;32 Executable file mi (none)
Missing file (defaults to fi) or (none) Orphaned symbolic
link (defaults to ln) lc ^[[ Left code rc m Right code ec
(none) End code (replaces lc+no+rc)</p>

<p>You need to include only the variables you want to
change from the default.</p>

<p>File names can also be colorized based on filename
extension. This is specified in the LS_COLORS variable using
the syntax &quot;*ext=string&quot;. For example, using ISO
6429 codes, to color all C-language source files blue you
would specify &quot;*.c=34&quot;. This would color all files
ending in .c in blue (34) color.</p>

<p>Control characters can be written either in
C-style-escaped notation, or in stty-like ^-notation. The
C-style notation adds ^[ for Escape, _ for a normal space
character, and ? for Delete. In addition, the ^[ escape
character can be used to override the default interpretation
of ^[, ^, : and =.</p>

<p>Each file will be written as &lt;lc&gt;
&lt;color-code&gt; &lt;rc&gt; &lt;filename&gt; &lt;ec&gt;.
If the &lt;ec&gt; code is undefined, the sequence &lt;lc&gt;
&lt;no&gt; &lt;rc&gt; will be used instead. This is
generally more convenient to use, but less general. The
left, right and end codes are provided so you dont have to
type common parts over and over again and to support weird
terminals; you will generally not need to change them at all
unless your terminal does not use ISO 6429 color sequences
but a different system.</p>

<p>If your terminal does use ISO 6429 color codes, you can
compose the type codes (i.e., all except the lc, rc, and ec
codes) from numerical commands separated by semicolons. The
most common commands are:</p>

<p>0 to restore default color 1 for brighter colors 4 for
underlined text 5 for flashing text 30 for black foreground
31 for red foreground 32 for green foreground 33 for yellow
(or brown) foreground 34 for blue foreground 35 for purple
foreground 36 for cyan foreground 37 for white (or gray)
foreground 40 for black background 41 for red background 42
for green background 43 for yellow (or brown) background 44
for blue background 45 for purple background 46 for cyan
background 47 for white (or gray) background</p>

<p>Not all commands will work on all systems or display
devices.</p>

<p>A few terminal programs do not recognize the default end
code properly. If all text gets colorized after you do a
directory listing, try changing the no and fi codes from 0
to the numeri- cal codes for your standard fore- and
background colors.</p>

<p>MACHTYPE (+) The machine type (microprocessor class or
machine model), as determined at compile time.</p>

<p>NOREBIND (+) If set, printable characters are not
rebound to self-insert- command. See Native Language System
support.</p>

<p>OSTYPE (+) The operating system, as determined at
compile time.</p>

<p>PATH A colon-separated list of directories in which to
look for exe- cutables. Equivalent to the path shell
variable, but in a dif- ferent format.</p>

<p>PWD (+) Equivalent to the cwd shell variable, but not
synchronized to it; updated only after an actual directory
change.</p>

<p>REMOTEHOST (+) The host from which the user has logged
in remotely, if this is the case and the shell is able to
determine it. Set only if the shell was so compiled; see the
version shell variable.</p>

<p>SHLVL (+) Equivalent to the shlvl shell variable.</p>

<p>SYSTYPE (+) The current system type. (Domain/OS
only)</p>

<p>TERM Equivalent to the term shell variable.</p>

<p>TERMCAP The terminal capability string. See Terminal
management.</p>

<p>USER Equivalent to the user shell variable.</p>

<p>VENDOR (+) The vendor, as determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>VISUAL The pathname to a default full-screen editor. See
also the EDITOR environment variable and the run-fg-editor
editor com- mand.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/csh.cshrc Read first by every shell.
ConvexOS, Stellix and Intel use /etc/cshrc and NeXTs use
/etc/cshrc.std. A/UX, AMIX, Cray and IRIX have no equivalent
in csh(1), but read this file in tcsh anyway. Solaris 2.x
does not have it either, but tcsh reads /etc/.cshrc. (+)
/etc/csh.login Read by login shells after /etc/csh.cshrc.
ConvexOS, Stellix and Intel use /etc/login, NeXTs use
/etc/login.std, Solaris 2.x uses /etc/.login and A/UX, AMIX,
Cray and IRIX use /etc/cshrc. ~/.tcshrc (+) Read by every
shell after /etc/csh.cshrc or its equiva- lent. ~/.cshrc
Read by every shell, if ~/.tcshrc doesnt exist, after
/etc/csh.cshrc or its equivalent. This manual uses ~/.tcshrc
to mean ~/.tcshrc or, if ~/.tcshrc is not found, ~/.cshrc.
~/.history Read by login shells after ~/.tcshrc if savehist
is set, but see also histfile. ~/.login Read by login shells
after ~/.tcshrc or ~/.history. The shell may be compiled to
read ~/.login before instead of after ~/.tcshrc and
~/.history; see the ver- sion shell variable. ~/.cshdirs (+)
Read by login shells after ~/.login if savedirs is set, but
see also dirsfile. /etc/csh.logout Read by login shells at
logout. ConvexOS, Stellix and Intel use /etc/logout and
NeXTs use /etc/logout.std. A/UX, AMIX, Cray and IRIX have no
equivalent in csh(1), but read this file in tcsh anyway.
Solaris 2.x does not have it either, but tcsh reads
/etc/.logout. (+) ~/.logout Read by login shells at logout
after /etc/csh.logout or its equivalent. /bin/sh Used to
interpret shell scripts not starting with a #. /tmp/sh*
Temporary file for &lt;&lt;. /etc/passwd Source of home
directories for ~name substitutions.</p>

<p>The order in which startup files are read may differ if
the shell was so compiled; see Startup and shutdown and the
version shell variable.</p>

<p>NEW FEATURES (+) This manual describes tcsh as a single
entity, but experienced csh(1) users will want to pay
special attention to tcsh s new features.</p>

<p>A command-line editor, which supports GNU Emacs or
vi(1)-style key bindings. See The command-line editor and
Editor commands.</p>

<p>Programmable, interactive word completion and listing.
See Completion and listing and the complete and uncomplete
builtin commands.</p>

<p>Spelling correction (q.v.) of filenames, commands and
variables.</p>

<p>Editor commands (q.v.) which perform other useful
functions in the mid- dle of typed commands, including
documentation lookup (run-help), quick editor restarting
(run-fg-editor) and command resolution (which-com-
mand).</p>

<p>An enhanced history mechanism. Events in the history
list are time- stamped. See also the history command and its
associated shell vari- ables, the previously undocumented #
event specifier and new modi- fiers under History
substitution, the *-history, history-search-*, i- search-*,
vi-search-* and toggle-literal-history editor commands and
the histlit shell variable.</p>

<p>Enhanced directory parsing and directory stack handling.
See the cd, pushd, popd and dirs commands and their
associated shell variables, the description of Directory
stack substitution, the dirstack, owd and sym- links shell
variables and the normalize-command and normalize-path edi-
tor commands.</p>

<p>Negation in glob-patterns. See Filename
substitution.</p>

<p>New File inquiry operators (q.v.) and a filetest builtin
which uses them.</p>

<p>A variety of Automatic, periodic and timed events (q.v.)
including scheduled events, special aliases, automatic
logout and terminal lock- ing, command timing and watching
for logins and logouts.</p>

<p>Support for the Native Language System (see Native
Language System sup- port), OS variant features (see OS
variant support and the echo_style shell variable) and
system-dependent file locations (see FILES).</p>

<p>Extensive terminal-management capabilities. See Terminal
management.</p>

<p>New builtin commands including builtins, hup, ls-F,
newgrp, printenv, which and where (q.v.).</p>

<p>New variables that make useful information easily
available to the shell. See the gid, loginsh, oid, shlvl,
tcsh, tty, uid and version shell variables and the HOST,
REMOTEHOST, VENDOR, OSTYPE and MACHTYPE environment
variables.</p>

<p>A new syntax for including useful information in the
prompt string (see prompt). and special prompts for loops
and spelling correction (see prompt2 and prompt3).</p>

<p>Read-only variables. See Variable substitution.</p>

<p>BUGS When a suspended command is restarted, the shell
prints the directory it started in if this is different from
the current directory. This can be misleading (i.e., wrong)
as the job may have changed directories internally.</p>

<p>Shell builtin functions are not stoppable/restartable.
Command sequences of the form a ; b ; c are also not handled
gracefully when stopping is attempted. If you suspend b, the
shell will then immedi- ately execute c . This is especially
noticeable if this expansion results from an alias. It
suffices to place the sequence of commands in ()s to force
it to a subshell, i.e., ( a ; b ; c ).</p>

<p>Control over tty output after processes are started is
primitive; per- haps this will inspire someone to work on a
good virtual terminal interface. In a virtual terminal
interface much more interesting things could be done with
output control.</p>

<p>Alias substitution is most often used to clumsily
simulate shell proce- dures; shell procedures should be
provided rather than aliases.</p>

<p>Commands within loops are not placed in the history
list. Control structures should be parsed rather than being
recognized as built-in commands. This would allow control
commands to be placed anywhere, to be combined with | , and
to be used with &amp; and ; metasyntax.</p>

<p>foreach doesnt ignore here documents when looking for
its end.</p>

<p>It should be possible to use the : modifiers on the
output of command substitutions.</p>

<p>The screen update for lines longer than the screen width
is very poor if the terminal cannot move the cursor up
(i.e., terminal type dumb).</p>

<p>HPATH and NOREBIND dont need to be environment
variables.</p>

<p>Glob-patterns which do not use ?, * or [] or which use
{} or ~ are not negated correctly.</p>

<p>The single-command form of if does output redirection
even if the expression is false and the command is not
executed.</p>

<p>ls-F includes file identification characters when
sorting filenames and does not handle control characters in
filenames well. It cannot be interrupted.</p>

<p>Command substitution supports multiple commands and
conditions, but not cycles or backward gotos.</p>

<p>THE T IN TCSH In 1964, DEC produced the PDP-6. The
PDP-10 was a later re-implementa- tion. It was re-christened
the DECsystem-10 in 1970 or so when DEC brought out the
second model, the KI10.</p>

<p>TENEX was created at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman (a
Cambridge, Massachusetts think tank) in 1972 as an
experiment in demand-paged virtual memory operating systems.
They built a new pager for the DEC PDP-10 and cre- ated the
OS to go with it. It was extremely successful in

<p>In 1975, DEC brought out a new model of the PDP-10, the
KL10; they intended to have only a version of TENEX, which
they had licensed from BBN, for the new box. They called
their version TOPS-20 (their capi- talization is
trademarked). A lot of TOPS-10 users ( The OPerating System
for PDP-10 ) objected; thus DEC found themselves supporting
two incompatible systems on the same hardware--but then
there were 6 on the PDP-11!</p>

<p>TENEX, and TOPS-20 to version 3, had command completion
via a user- code-level subroutine library called ULTCMD.
With version 3, DEC moved all that capability and more into
the monitor (kernel for you Unix types), accessed by the
COMND% JSYS ( Jump to SYStem instruction, the supervisor
call mechanism [are my IBM roots also showing?]).</p>

<p>The creator of tcsh was impressed by this feature and
several others of TENEX and TOPS-20, and created a version
of csh which mimicked them.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The system limits argument lists to ARG_MAX
characters.</p>

<p>The number of arguments to a command which involves
filename expansion is limited to 1/6th the number of
characters allowed in an argument list.</p>

<p>Command substitutions may substitute no more characters
than are allowed in an argument list.</p>

<p>To detect looping, the shell restricts the number of
alias substitu- tions on a single line to 20.</p>
