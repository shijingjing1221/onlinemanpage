<p>NAME file - determine file type</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS file [-bchikLNnprsvz0] [--apple]
[--mime-encoding] [--mime-type] [-e testname] [-F separator]
[-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] file ... file -C [-m
magicfiles] file [--help]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents version 5.04 of
the file command.</p>

<p>file tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.
There are three sets of tests, performed in this order:
filesystem tests, magic tests, and language tests. The first
test that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.</p>

<p>The type printed will usually contain one of the words
text (the file contains only printing characters and a few
common control characters and is probably safe to read on an
ASCII terminal), executable (the file con- tains the result
of compiling a program in a form understandable to some UNIX
kernel or another), or data meaning anything else (data is
usually binary or non-printable). Exceptions are well-known
file formats (core files, tar archives) that are known to
contain binary data. When modify- ing magic files or the
program itself, make sure to preserve these keywords. Users
depend on knowing that all the readable files in a directory
have the word text printed. Dont do as Berkeley did and
change shell commands text to shell script.</p>

<p>The filesystem tests are based on examining the return
from a stat(2) system call. The program checks to see if the
file is empty, or if its some sort of special file. Any
known file types appropriate to the sys- tem you are running
on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those
systems that implement them) are intuited if they are
defined in the system header file</p>

<p>The magic tests are used to check for files with data in
particular fixed formats. The canonical example of this is a
binary executable (compiled program) a.out file, whose
format is defined in #include &lt;a.out.h&gt; and possibly
#include &lt;exec.h&gt; in the standard include directory.
These files have a magic number stored in a particular place
near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating
system that the file is a binary executable, and which of
several types thereof. The concept of a magic has been
applied by extension to data files. Any file with some
invariant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file
can usually be described in this way. The information
identifying these files is read from the compiled magic file
/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc, or the files in the directory
/usr/share/misc/magic if the compiled file does not exist.
In addition, if $HOME/.magic.mgc or $HOME/.magic exists, it
will be used in preference to the system magic files. If
/etc/magic exists, it will be used together with other magic
files.</p>

<p>If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic
file, it is examined to see if it seems to be a text file.
ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non- ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character
sets (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems),
UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC
character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges
and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in
each set. If a file passes any of these tests, its character
set is reported. ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and
extended-ASCII files are identified as text because they
will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and
EBCDIC are only character data because, while they contain
text, it is text that will require translation before it can
be read. In addition, file will attempt to determine other
characteristics of text-type files. If the lines of a file
are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the
Unix-standard LF, this will be reported. Files that contain
embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be
identified.</p>

<p>Once file has determined the character set used in a
text-type file, it will attempt to determine in what
language the file is written. The lan- guage tests look for
particular strings (cf. #include &lt;names.h&gt; ) that can
appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a file. For exam-
ple, the keyword .br indicates that the file is most likely
a troff(1) input file, just as the keyword struct indicates
a C program. These tests are less reliable than the previous
two groups, so they are per- formed last. The language test
routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1)
archives).</p>

<p>Any file that cannot be identified as having been
written in any of the character sets listed above is simply
said to be data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b, --brief Do not prepend filenames to output
lines (brief mode).</p>

<p>-C, --compile Write a magic.mgc output file that
contains a pre-parsed version of the magic file or
directory.</p>

<p>-c, --checking-printout Cause a checking printout of the
parsed form of the magic file. This is usually used in
conjunction with the -m flag to debug a new magic file
before installing it.</p>

<p>-e, --exclude testname Exclude the test named in
testname from the list of tests made to determine the file
type. Valid test names are:</p>

<p>apptype EMX application type (only on EMX).</p>

<p>text Various types of text files (this test will try to
guess the text encoding, irrespective of the setting of the
encoding option).</p>

<p>encoding Different text encodings for soft magic
tests.</p>

<p>tokens Looks for known tokens inside text files.</p>

<p>cdf Prints details of Compound Document Files.</p>

<p>compress Checks for, and looks inside, compressed
files.</p>

<p>elf Prints ELF file details.</p>

<p>soft Consults magic files.</p>

<p>tar Examines tar files.</p>

<p>-F, --separator separator Use the specified string as
the separator between the filename and the file result
returned. Defaults to :.</p>

<p>-f, --files-from namefile Read the names of the files to
be examined from namefile (one per line) before the argument
list. Either namefile or at least one filename argument must
be present; to test the standard input, use - as a filename
argument.</p>

<p>-h, --no-dereference option causes symlinks not to be
followed (on systems that sup- port symbolic links). This is
the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
not defined.</p>

<p>-i, --mime Causes the file command to output mime type
strings rather than the more traditional human readable
ones. Thus it may say text/plain; charset=us-ascii rather
than ASCII text. In order for this option to work, file
changes the way it handles files recognized by the command
itself (such as many of the text file types, directories
etc), and makes use of an alternative magic file. (See the
FILES section, below).</p>

<p>--mime-type, --mime-encoding Like -i, but print only the
specified element(s).</p>

<p>-k, --keep-going Dont stop at the first match, keep
going. Subsequent matches will be have the string 12-
prepended. (If you want a new- line, see the -r option.)</p>

<p>-L, --dereference option causes symlinks to be followed,
as the like-named option in ls(1) (on systems that support
symbolic links). This is the default if the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.</p>

<p>-m, --magic-file magicfiles Specify an alternate list of
files and directories containing magic. This can be a single
item, or a colon-separated list. If a compiled magic file is
found alongside a file or directory, it will be used
instead.</p>

<p>-N, --no-pad Dont pad filenames so that they align in
the output.</p>

<p>-n, --no-buffer Force stdout to be flushed after
checking each file. This is only useful if checking a list
of files. It is intended to be used by programs that want
filetype output from a pipe.</p>

<p>-p, --preserve-date On systems that support utime(2) or
utimes(2), attempt to pre- serve the access time of files
analyzed, to pretend that file never read them.</p>

<p>-r, --raw Dont translate unprintable characters to .
Normally file translates unprintable characters to their
octal representation.</p>

<p>-s, --special-files Normally, file only attempts to read
and determine the type of argument files which stat(2)
reports are ordinary files. This prevents problems, because
reading special files may have pecu- liar consequences.
Specifying the -s option causes file to also read argument
files which are block or character special files. This is
useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in
raw disk partitions, which are block special files. This
option also causes file to disregard the file size as
reported by stat(2) since on some systems it reports a zero
size for raw disk partitions.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version of the program and
exit.</p>

<p>-z, --uncompress Try to look inside compressed
files.</p>

<p>-0, --print0 Output a null character after the end of
the filename. Nice to cut(1) the output. This does not
affect the separator which is still printed.</p>

<p>--help Print a help message and exit.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc Default compiled list of
magic. /usr/share/misc/magic Directory containing default
magic files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable MAGIC can be used
to set the default magic file name. If that variable is set,
then file will not attempt to open $HOME/.magic. file adds
.mgc to the value of this variable as appro- priate. The
environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT controls (on systems
that support symbolic links), whether file will attempt to
follow sym- links or not. If set, then file follows symlink,
otherwise it does not. This is also controlled by the -L and
-h options.</p>

<p>STANDARDS CONFORMANCE This program is believed to exceed
the System V Interface Definition of FILE(CMD), as near as
one can determine from the vague language contained therein.
Its behavior is mostly compatible with the System V program
of the same name. This version knows more magic, however, so
it will pro- duce different (albeit more accurate) output in
many cases.</p>

<p>The one significant difference between this version and
System V is that this version treats any white space as a
delimiter, so that spaces in pattern strings must be
escaped. For example,</p>

<p>&gt;10 string language impress (imPRESS data)</p>

<p>in an existing magic file would have to be changed
to</p>

<p>&gt;10 string language impress (imPRESS data)</p>

<p>In addition, in this version, if a pattern string
contains a backslash, it must be escaped. For example</p>

<p>g i n d a 0 string tw Toolkit document a A n d r</p>

<p>in an existing magic file would have to be changed
to</p>

<p>0 string \begindata Andrew Toolkit document</p>

<p>SunOS releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems
include a file command derived from the System V one, but
with some extensions. My version dif- fers from Sun s only
in minor ways. It includes the extension of the &amp;
operator, used as, for example,</p>

<p>&gt;16 long&amp;0x7fffffff &gt;0 not stripped</p>

<p>MAGIC DIRECTORY The magic file entries have been
collected from various sources, mainly USENET, and
contributed by various authors. Christos Zoulas (address
below) will collect additional or corrected magic file
entries. A con- solidation of magic file entries will be
distributed periodically.</p>

<p>The order of entries in the magic file is significant.
Depending on what system you are using, the order that they
are put together may be incor- rect. If your old file
command uses a magic file, keep the old magic file around
for comparison purposes (rename it to
/usr/share/misc/magic.orig ).</p>

<p>HISTORY There has been a file command in every UNIX
since at least Research Version 4 (man page dated November,
1973). The System V version intro- duced one significant
major change: the external list of magic types. This slowed
the program down slightly but made it a lot more
flexible.</p>

<p>This program, based on the System V version, was written
by Ian Darwin &lt;ian@darwinsys.com&gt; without looking at
anybody elses source code.</p>

<p>John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it
better than the first version. Geoff Collyer found several
inadequacies and provided some magic file entries.
Contributions by the &amp; operator by Rob McMa- hon,
cudcv@warwick.ac.uk, 1989.</p>

<p>Guy Harris, guy@netapp.com, made many changes from 1993
to the present.</p>

<p>Primary development and maintenance from 1990 to the
present by Christos Zoulas (christos@astron.com).</p>

<p>Altered by Chris Lowth, chris@lowth.com, 2000: Handle
the -i option to output mime type strings, using an
alternative magic file and internal logic.</p>

<p>Altered by Eric Fischer (enf@pobox.com), July, 2000, to
identify charac- ter codes and attempt to identify the
languages of non-ASCII files.</p>

<p>Altered by Reuben Thomas (rrt@sc3d.org), 2007 to 2008,
to improve MIME support and merge MIME and non-MIME magic,
support directories as well as files of magic, apply many
bug fixes and improve the build system.</p>

<p>The list of contributors to the magic directory (magic
files) is too long to include here. You know who you are;
thank you. Many contribu- tors are listed in the source
files.</p>

<p>LEGAL NOTICE Copyright (c) Ian F. Darwin, Toronto,

<p>The files tar.h and is_tar.c were written by John

<p>BUGS There must be a better way to automate the
construction of the Magic file from all the glop in Magdir.
What is it?</p>

<p>file uses several algorithms that favor speed over
accuracy, thus it can be misled about the contents of text
files.</p>

<p>The support for text files (primarily for programming
languages) is sim- plistic, inefficient and requires
recompilation to update.</p>

<p>The list of keywords in ascmagic probably belongs in the
Magic file. This could be done by using some keyword like *
for the offset value.</p>

<p>Complain about conflicts in the magic file entries. Make
a rule that the magic entries sort based on file offset
rather than position within the magic file?</p>

<p>The program should provide a way to give an estimate of
how good a guess is. We end up removing guesses (e.g. Fromas
first 5 chars of file) because they are not as good as other
guesses (e.g. Newsgroups: versus Return-Path: ). Still, if
the others dont pan out, it should be possible to use the
first guess.</p>

<p>This manual page, and particularly this section, is too
long.</p>

<p>RETURN CODE file returns 0 on success, and non-zero on
error.</p>

<p>If the file named by the file operand does not exist,
cannot be read, or the type of the file named by the file
operand cannot be determined, this is not be considered an
error that affects the exit status.</p>
