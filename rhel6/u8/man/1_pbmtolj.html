<p>NAME pbmtolj - convert a PBM image to HP LaserJet
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtolj [-resolution N] [-float] [-noreset]
[-packbits] [-delta] [-com- press] [pbmfile] [-copies N]</p>

<p>You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtolj reads a PBM image as input and produces HP
LaserJet data as output. You can send this data to a
LaserJet or DeskJet printer (at least some of them).</p>

<p>Each pixel in the input PBM image becomes one dot in the
printed out- put. Therefore, you must make sure the width
and height of the input are appropriate for the print
resolution you choose and the print area you want. E.g. if
you print at 300 dpi and want the image to print as 8 inches
by 10, you must supply a PBM that is 2400 pixels wide by
3000 pixels high. You can adjust the size of the input with
pamscale, pam- stretch, pbmreduce, or pamenlarge.</p>

<p>The input may be a multi-image PBM stream. Each input
image becomes a page of output. But before Netpbm 10.28
(June 2005), images after the first one are ignored.</p>

<p>Note that there is no ljtopbm tool.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -resolution Specifies the resolution of the
output device, in dpi. Another way to look at this is as a
declaration of the resolution of the input image (PBM images
don t have inherent resolution). Typi- cal values are 75,
100, 150, 300, and 600. The default is 75.</p>

<p>-float Suppresses positioning commands. By default,
pbmtolj places the sequence ESC &amp; l 0 E in the output,
which means to force the top margin to zero. With -float,
pbmtolj omits that command.</p>

<p>-noreset Prevents pbmtolj from writing the reset
sequences to the begin- ning and end of the output file.</p>

<p>-packbits Enables use of TIFF packbits compression.</p>

<p>-delta Enables use of delta-between-rows
compression.</p>

<p>-compress Enables use of both TIFF packbits, and
delta-between-rows com- pression.</p>

<p>-copies Specifies the the number of copies. The default
is 1. This option controls the number of copies printer
control; pbmtolj generates only one copy of the image.</p>
