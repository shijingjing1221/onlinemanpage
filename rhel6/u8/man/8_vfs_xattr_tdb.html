<p>NAME vfs_xattr_tdb - Save Extended Attributes (EAs) in a
tdb file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = xattr_tdb</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_xattr_tdb VFS module stores Extended Attributes
(EAs) in a tdb file. This enables the usage of Extended
Attributes on OS and filesystems which do not support
Extended Attributes by themselves.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS xattr_tdb:file = PATH Name of the tdb file the
EAs are stored in. If this option is not set, the default
filename xattr.tdb is used.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
