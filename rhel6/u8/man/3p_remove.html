<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME remove - remove a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int remove(const char *path);</p>

<p>If path does not name a directory, remove(path) shall be
equivalent to unlink(path).</p>

<p>If path names a directory, remove(path) shall be
equivalent to rmdir(path).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to rmdir() or unlink().</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to rmdir() or unlink().</p>
