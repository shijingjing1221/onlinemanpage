<p>SHMCTL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SHMCTL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME shmctl - XSI shared memory control operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shmctl(int shmid, int cmd, struct shmid_ds
*buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shmctl() function operates on XSI shared
memory (see the Base Defi- nitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.340, Shared Memory Object). It is
unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in
Realtime .</p>

<p>The shmctl() function provides a variety of shared
memory control oper- ations as specified by cmd. The
following values for cmd are available:</p>

<p>IPC_STAT Place the current value of each member of the
shmid_ds data structure associated with shmid into the
structure pointed to by buf. The contents of the structure
are defined in &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;.</p>

<p>IPC_SET Set the value of the following members of the
shmid_ds data structure associated with shmid to the
corresponding value found in the structure pointed to by
buf:</p>

<p>shm_perm.uid shm_perm.gid shm_perm.mode Low-order nine
bits.</p>

<p>IPC_SET can only be executed by a process that has an
effective user ID equal to either that of a process with
appropriate privileges or to the value of shm_perm.cuid or
shm_perm.uid in the shmid_ds data structure associated with
shmid.</p>

<p>IPC_RMID Remove the shared memory identifier specified
by shmid from the system and destroy the shared memory
segment and shmid_ds data structure associated with it.
IPC_RMID can only be executed by a process that has an
effective user ID equal to either that of a process with
appropriate privileges or to the value of shm_perm.cuid or
shm_perm.uid in the shmid_ds data structure associated with
shmid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, shmctl() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The shmctl() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The argument cmd is equal to IPC_STAT and the
calling process does not have read permission; see XSI
Interprocess Communication .</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of shmid is not a valid shared memory
identifier, or the value of cmd is not a valid command.</p>

<p>EPERM The argument cmd is equal to IPC_RMID or IPC_SET
and the effec- tive user ID of the calling process is not
equal to that of a process with appropriate privileges and
it is not equal to the value of shm_perm.cuid or
shm_perm.uid in the data structure associated with
shmid.</p>

<p>The shmctl() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The cmd argument is IPC_STAT and the gid or
uid value is too large to be stored in the structure pointed
to by the buf argu- ment.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The POSIX Realtime Extension defines
alternative interfaces for inter- process communication.
Application developers who need to use IPC should design
their applications so that modules using the IPC routines
described in XSI Interprocess Communication can be easily
modified to use the alternative interfaces.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
