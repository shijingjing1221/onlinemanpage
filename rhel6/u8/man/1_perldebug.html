<p>PERLDEBUG(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLDEBUG(1)</p>

<p>NAME perldebug - Perl debugging</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION First of all, have you tried using the -w
switch?</p>

<p>If youre new to the Perl debugger, you may prefer to
read perldebtut, which is a tutorial introduction to the
debugger .</p>

<p>The Perl Debugger If you invoke Perl with the -d switch,
your script runs under the Perl source debugger. This works
like an interactive Perl environment, prompting for debugger
commands that let you examine source code, set breakpoints,
get stack backtraces, change the values of variables, etc.
This is so convenient that you often fire up the debugger
all by itself just to test out Perl constructs interactively
to see what they do. For example:</p>

<p>$ perl -d -e 42</p>

<p>In Perl, the debugger is not a separate program the way
it usually is in the typical compiled environment. Instead,
the -d flag tells the compiler to insert source information
into the parse trees its about to hand off to the
interpreter. That means your code must first compile
correctly for the debugger to work on it. Then when the
interpreter starts up, it preloads a special Perl library
file containing the debugger.</p>

<p>The program will halt right before the first run-time
executable statement (but see below regarding compile-time
statements) and ask you to enter a debugger command.
Contrary to popular expectations, whenever the debugger
halts and shows you a line of code, it always displays the
line its about to execute, rather than the one it has just
executed.</p>

<p>Any command not recognized by the debugger is directly
executed (&quot;eval&quot; d) as Perl code in the current
package. (The debugger uses the DB package for keeping its
own state information.)</p>

<p>Note that the said &quot;eval&quot; is bound by an
implicit scope. As a result any newly introduced lexical
variable or any modified capture buffer content is lost
after the eval. The debugger is a nice environment to learn
Perl, but if you interactively experiment using material
which should be in the same scope, stuff it in one line.</p>

<p>For any text entered at the debugger prompt, leading and
trailing whitespace is first stripped before further
processing. If a debugger command coincides with some
function in your own program, merely precede the function
with something that doesnt look like a debugger command,
such as a leading &quot;;&quot; or perhaps a &quot;+&quot;,
or by wrapping it with parentheses or braces.</p>

<p>Calling the debugger There are several ways to call the
debugger:</p>

<p>perl -d program_name On the given program identified by
&quot;program_name&quot;.</p>

<p>perl -d -e 0 Interactively supply an arbitrary
&quot;expression&quot; using &quot;-e&quot;.</p>

<p>perl -d:Ptkdb program_name Debug a given program via the
&quot;Devel::Ptkdb&quot; GUI.</p>

<p>perl -dt threaded_program_name Debug a given program
using threads (experimental).</p>

<p>Debugger Commands The interactive debugger understands
the following commands:</p>

<p>h Prints out a summary help message</p>

<p>h [command] Prints out a help message for the given
debugger command.</p>

<p>h h The special argument of &quot;h h&quot; produces the
entire help page, which is quite long.</p>

<p>If the output of the &quot;h h&quot; command (or any
command, for that matter) scrolls past your screen, precede
the command with a leading pipe symbol so that its run
through your pager, as in</p>

<p>DB&gt; |h h</p>

<p>You may change the pager which is used via &quot;o
pager=...&quot; command.</p>

<p>p expr Same as &quot;print {$DB::OUT} expr&quot; in the
current package. In particular, because this is just Perl s
own &quot;print&quot; function, this means that nested data
structures and objects are not dumped, unlike with the
&quot;x&quot; command.</p>

<p>The &quot;DB::OUT&quot; filehandle is opened to
/dev/tty, regardless of where STDOUT may be redirected
to.</p>

<p>x [maxdepth] expr Evaluates its expression in list
context and dumps out the result in a pretty-printed
fashion. Nested data structures are printed out recursively,
unlike the real &quot;print&quot; function in Perl. When
dumping hashes, youll probably prefer x h rather than x %h.
See Dumpvalue if youd like to do this yourself.</p>

<p>The output format is governed by multiple options
described under &quot;Configurable Options&quot;.</p>

<p>If the &quot;maxdepth&quot; is included, it must be a
numeral N; the value is dumped only N levels deep, as if the
&quot;dumpDepth&quot; option had been temporarily set to
N.</p>

<p>V [pkg [vars]] Display all (or some) variables in
package (defaulting to &quot;main&quot;) using a data
pretty-printer (hashes show their keys and values so you see
what s what, control characters are made printable, etc.).
Make sure you dont put the type specifier (like
&quot;$&quot;) there, just the symbol names, like this:</p>

<p>V DB filename line</p>

<p>Use &quot;~pattern&quot; and &quot;!pattern&quot; for
positive and negative regexes.</p>

<p>This is similar to calling the &quot;x&quot; command on
each applicable var.</p>

<p>X [vars] Same as &quot;V currentpackage
[vars]&quot;.</p>

<p>y [level [vars]] Display all (or some) lexical variables
(mnemonic: &quot;mY&quot; variables) in the current scope or
level scopes higher. You can limit the variables that you
see with vars which works exactly as it does for the
&quot;V&quot; and &quot;X&quot; commands. Requires the
&quot;PadWalker&quot; module version 0.08 or higher; will
warn if this isnt installed. Output is pretty- printed in
the same style as for &quot;V&quot; and the format is
controlled by the same options.</p>

<p>T Produce a stack backtrace. See below for details on
its output.</p>

<p>s [expr] Single step. Executes until the beginning of
another statement, descending into subroutine calls. If an
expression is supplied that includes function calls, it too
will be single-stepped.</p>

<p>n [expr] Next. Executes over subroutine calls, until the
beginning of the next statement. If an expression is
supplied that includes function calls, those functions will
be executed with stops before each statement.</p>

<p>r Continue until the return from the current subroutine.
Dump the return value if the &quot;PrintRet&quot; option is
set (default).</p>

<p>&lt;CR&gt; Repeat last &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot;
command.</p>

<p>c [line|sub] Continue, optionally inserting a
one-time-only breakpoint at the specified line or
subroutine.</p>

<p>l List next window of lines.</p>

<p>l min+incr List &quot;incr+1&quot; lines starting at
&quot;min&quot;.</p>

<p>l min-max List lines &quot;min&quot; through
&quot;max&quot;. &quot;l -&quot; is synonymous to
&quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p>l line List a single line.</p>

<p>l subname List first window of lines from subroutine.
subname may be a variable that contains a code
reference.</p>

<p>- List previous window of lines.</p>

<p>v [line] View a few lines of code around the current
line.</p>

<p>. Return the internal debugger pointer to the line last
executed, and print out that line.</p>

<p>f filename Switch to viewing a different file or
&quot;eval&quot; statement. If filename is not a full
pathname found in the values of %INC, it is considered a
regex.</p>

<p>&quot;eval&quot;ed strings (when accessible) are
considered to be a c c e s s t filenames: &quot;f (eval
7)&quot; and &quot;f eval 7h e b o d y o f the 7th
&quot;eval&quot;ed string (in the order of execution). The
bodies of the currently executed &quot;eval&quot; and of
&quot;eval&quot;ed strings that define subroutines are saved
and thus accessible.</p>

<p>/pattern/ Search forwards for pattern (a Perl regex);
final / is optional. The search is case-insensitive by
default.</p>

<p>?pattern? Search backwards for pattern; final ? is
optional. The search is case-insensitive by default.</p>

<p>L [abw] List (default all) actions, breakpoints and
watch expressions</p>

<p>S [[!]regex] List subroutine names [not] matching the
regex.</p>

<p>t Toggle trace mode (see also the &quot;AutoTrace&quot;
option).</p>

<p>t expr Trace through execution of &quot;expr&quot;. See
&quot;Frame Listing Output Examples&quot; in perldebguts for
examples.</p>

<p>b Sets breakpoint on current line</p>

<p>b [line] [condition] Set a breakpoint before the given
line. If a condition is specified, it s evaluated each time
the statement is reached: a breakpoint is taken only if the
condition is true. Breakpoints may only be set on lines that
begin an executable statement. Conditions don t use
&quot;if&quot;:</p>

<p>b 237 $x &gt; 30 b 237 ++$count237 &lt; 11 b 33
/pattern/i</p>

<p>b subname [condition] Set a breakpoint before the first
line of the named subroutine. subname may be a variable
containing a code reference (in this case condition is not
supported).</p>

<p>b postpone subname [condition] Set a breakpoint at first
line of subroutine after it is compiled.</p>

<p>b load filename Set a breakpoint before the first
executed line of the filename, which should be a full
pathname found amongst the %INC values.</p>

<p>b compile subname Sets a breakpoint before the first
statement executed after the specified subroutine is
compiled.</p>

<p>B line Delete a breakpoint from the specified line.</p>

<p>B * Delete all installed breakpoints.</p>

<p>a [line] command Set an action to be done before the
line is executed. If line is omitted, set an action on the
line about to be executed. The sequence of steps taken by
the debugger is</p>

<p>1. check for a breakpoint at this line 2. print the line
if necessary (tracing) 3. do any actions associated with
that line 4. prompt user if at a breakpoint or in
single-step 5. evaluate line</p>

<p>For example, this will print out $foo every time line 53
is passed:</p>

<p>a 53 print &quot;DB FOUND $foo0</p>

<p>A line Delete an action from the specified line.</p>

<p>A * Delete all installed actions.</p>

<p>w expr Add a global watch-expression. Whenever a watched
global changes the debugger will stop and display the old
and new values.</p>

<p>W expr Delete watch-expression</p>

<p>W * Delete all watch-expressions.</p>

<p>o Display all options</p>

<p>o booloption ... Set each listed Boolean option to the
value 1.</p>

<p>o anyoption? ... Print out the value of one or more
options.</p>

<p>o option=value ... Set the value of one or more options.
If the value has internal whitespace, it should be quoted.
For example, you could set &quot;o pager=&quot;less
-MQeicsNfr&quot;&quot; to call less with those specific
options. You may use either single or double quotes, but if
you do, you must escape any embedded instances of same sort
of quote you began with, as well as any escaping any escapes
that immediately precede that quote but which are not meant
to escape the quote itself. In other words, you follow
single-quoting rules irrespective of the quote; eg: &quot;o
option=&rsquo;this isn&acute;t bad&rsquo;&quot; or &quot;o
option=&quot;She said,</p>

<p>For historical reasons, the &quot;=value&quot; is
optional, but defaults to 1 only where it is safe to do
so--that is, mostly for Boolean options. It is always better
to assign a specific value using &quot;=&quot;. The
&quot;option&quot; can be abbreviated, but for clarity
probably should not be. Several options can be set together.
See &quot;Configurable Options&quot; for a list of
these.</p>

<p>&lt; ? List out all pre-prompt Perl command actions.</p>

<p>&lt; [ command ] Set an action (Perl command) to happen
before every debugger prompt. A multi-line command may be
entered by backslashing the newlines.</p>

<p>&lt; * Delete all pre-prompt Perl command actions.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt; command Add an action (Perl command) to happen
before every debugger prompt. A multi-line command may be
entered by backwhacking the newlines.</p>

<p>&gt; ? List out post-prompt Perl command actions.</p>

<p>&gt; command Set an action (Perl command) to happen
after the prompt when youve just given a command to return
to executing the script. A multi-line command may be entered
by backslashing the newlines (we bet you couldn t have
guessed this by now).</p>

<p>&gt; * Delete all post-prompt Perl command actions.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; command Adds an action (Perl command) to happen
after the prompt when youve just given a command to return
to executing the script. A multi-line command may be entered
by backslashing the newlines.</p>

<p>{ ? List out pre-prompt debugger commands.</p>

<p>{ [ command ] Set an action (debugger command) to happen
before every debugger prompt. A multi-line command may be
entered in the customary fashion.</p>

<p>Because this command is in some senses new, a warning is
issued if you appear to have accidentally entered a block
instead. If thats what you mean to do, write it as with
&quot;;{ ... }&quot; or even &quot;do { ... }&quot;.</p>

<p>{ * Delete all pre-prompt debugger commands.</p>

<p>{{ command Add an action (debugger command) to happen
before every debugger prompt. A multi-line command may be
entered, if you can guess how: see above.</p>

<p>! number Redo a previous command (defaults to the
previous command).</p>

<p>! -number Redo numberth previous command.</p>

<p>! pattern Redo last command that started with pattern.
See &quot;o recallCommand&quot;, too.</p>

<p>!! cmd Run cmd in a subprocess (reads from DB::IN,
writes to DB::OUT) See &quot;o shellBang&quot;, also. Note
that the users current shell (well, their $ENV{SHELL}
variable) will be used, which can interfere with proper
interpretation of exit status or signal and coredump
information.</p>

<p>source file Read and execute debugger commands from
file. file may itself contain &quot;source&quot;
commands.</p>

<p>H -number Display last n commands. Only commands longer
than one character are listed. If number is omitted, list
them all.</p>

<p>q or ^D Quit. (&quot;quit&quot; doesnt work for this,
unless youve made an alias) This is the only supported way
to exit the debugger, though typing &quot;exit&quot; twice
might work.</p>

<p>Set the &quot;inhibit_exit&quot; option to 0 if you want
to be able to step off the end the script. You may also need
to set $finished to 0 if you want to step through global
destruction.</p>

<p>R Restart the debugger by &quot;exec()&quot;ing a new
session. We try to maintain your history across this, but
internal settings and command-line options may be lost.</p>

<p>The following setting are currently preserved: history,
breakpoints, actions, debugger options, and the Perl
command-line options -w, -I, and -e.</p>

<p>|dbcmd Run the debugger command, piping DB::OUT into
your current pager.</p>

<p>||dbcmd Same as &quot;|dbcmd&quot; but DB::OUT is
temporarily &quot;select&quot;ed as well.</p>

<p>= [alias value] Define a command alias, like</p>

<p>= quit q</p>

<p>or list current aliases.</p>

<p>command Execute command as a Perl statement. A trailing
semicolon will be supplied. If the Perl statement would
otherwise be confused for a Perl debugger, use a leading
semicolon, too.</p>

<p>m expr List which methods may be called on the result of
the evaluated expression. The expression may evaluated to a
reference to a blessed object, or to a package name.</p>

<p>M Displays all loaded modules and their versions</p>

<p>man [manpage] Despite its name, this calls your systems
default documentation viewer on the given page, or on the
viewer itself if manpage is omitted. If that viewer is man,
the current &quot;Config&quot; information is used to invoke
man using the proper MANPATH or -M manpath option. Failed
lookups of the form &quot;XXX&quot; that match known
manpages of the form perlXXX will be retried. This lets you
type &quot;man debug&quot; or &quot;man op&quot; from the
debugger.</p>

<p>On systems traditionally bereft of a usable man command,
the debugger invokes perldoc. Occasionally this
determination is incorrect due to recalcitrant vendors or
rather more felicitously, to enterprising users. If you fall
into either category, just manually set the $DB::doccmd
variable to whatever viewer to view the Perl documentation
on your system. This may be set in an rc file, or through
direct assignment. Were still waiting for a working example
of something along the lines of:</p>

<p>$DB::doccmd = &rsquo;netscape -remote
http://something.here/&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Configurable Options The debugger has numerous options
settable using the &quot;o&quot; command, either
interactively or from the environment or an rc file.
(./.perldb or ~/.perldb under Unix.)</p>

<p>&quot;recallCommand&quot;, &quot;ShellBang&quot; The
characters used to recall command or spawn shell. By
default, both are set to &quot;!&quot;, which is
unfortunate.</p>

<p>&quot;pager&quot; Program to use for output of
pager-piped commands (those beginning with a &quot;|&quot;
character.) By default, $ENV{PAGER} will be used. Because
the debugger uses your current terminal characteristics for
bold and underlining, if the chosen pager does not pass
escape sequences through unchanged, the output of some
debugger commands will not be readable when sent through the
pager.</p>

<p>&quot;tkRunning&quot; Run Tk while prompting (with
ReadLine).</p>

<p>&quot;signalLevel&quot;, &quot;warnLevel&quot;,
&quot;dieLevel&quot; Level of verbosity. By default, the
debugger leaves your exceptions and warnings alone, because
altering them can break correctly running programs. It will
attempt to print a message when uncaught INT, BUS, or SEGV
signals arrive. (But see the mention of signals in BUGS
below.)</p>

<p>To disable this default safe mode, set these values to
something higher than 0. At a level of 1, you get backtraces
upon receiving any kind of warning (this is often annoying)
or exception (this is often valuable). Unfortunately, the
debugger cannot discern fatal exceptions from non-fatal
ones. If &quot;dieLevel&quot; is even 1, then your non-fatal
exceptions are also traced and unceremoniously altered if
they came from &quot;eval&rsquo;ed&quot; strings or from any
kind of &quot;eval&quot; within modules youre attempting to
load. If &quot;dieLevel&quot; is 2, the debugger doesn t
care where they came from: It usurps your exception handler
and prints out a trace, then modifies all exceptions with
its own embellishments. This may perhaps be useful for some
tracing purposes, but tends to hopelessly destroy any
program that takes its exception handling seriously.</p>

<p>&quot;AutoTrace&quot; Trace mode (similar to
&quot;t&quot; command, but can be put into
&quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;).</p>

<p>&quot;LineInfo&quot; File or pipe to print line number
info to. If it is a pipe (say, &quot;|visual_perl_db&quot;),
then a short message is used. This is the mechanism used to
interact with a slave editor or visual debugger, such as the
special &quot;vi&quot; or &quot;emacs&quot; hooks, or the
&quot;ddd&quot; graphical debugger.</p>

<p>&quot;inhibit_exit&quot; If 0, allows stepping off the
end of the script.</p>

<p>&quot;PrintRet&quot; Print return value after
&quot;r&quot; command if set (default).</p>

<p>&quot;ornaments&quot; Affects screen appearance of the
command line (see Term::ReadLine). There is currently no way
to disable these, which can render some output illegible on
some displays, or with some pagers. This is considered a
bug.</p>

<p>&quot;frame&quot; Affects the printing of messages upon
entry and exit from subroutines. If &quot;frame &amp;
2&quot; is false, messages are printed on entry only.
(Printing on exit might be useful if interspersed with other
messages.)</p>

<p>If &quot;frame &amp; 4&quot;, arguments to functions are
printed, plus context and caller info. If &quot;frame &amp;
8&quot;, overloaded &quot;stringify&quot; and
&quot;tie&quot;d &quot;FETCH&quot; is enabled on the printed
arguments. If &quot;frame &amp; 16&quot;, the return value
from the subroutine is printed.</p>

<p>The length at which the argument list is truncated is
governed by the next option:</p>

<p>&quot;maxTraceLen&quot; Length to truncate the argument
list when the &quot;frame&quot; options bit 4 is set.</p>

<p>&quot;windowSize&quot; Change the size of code list
window (default is 10 lines).</p>

<p>The following options affect what happens with
&quot;V&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;x&quot;
commands:</p>

<p>&quot;arrayDepth&quot;, &quot;hashDepth&quot; Print only
first N elements ( for all).</p>

<p>&quot;dumpDepth&quot; Limit recursion depth to N levels
when dumping structures. Negative values are interpreted as
infinity. Default: infinity.</p>

<p>&quot;compactDump&quot;, &quot;veryCompact&quot; Change
the style of array and hash output. If
&quot;compactDump&quot;, short array may be printed on one
line.</p>

<p>&quot;globPrint&quot; Whether to print contents of
globs.</p>

<p>&quot;DumpDBFiles&quot; Dump arrays holding debugged
files.</p>

<p>&quot;DumpPackages&quot; Dump symbol tables of
packages.</p>

<p>&quot;DumpReused&quot; Dump contents of
&quot;reused&quot; addresses.</p>

<p>&quot;quote&quot;, &quot;HighBit&quot;,
&quot;undefPrint&quot; Change the style of string dump. The
default value for &quot;quote&quot; is &quot;auto&quot;; one
can enable double-quotish or single- quotish format by
setting it to &quot;&quot;&quot; or &quot;&rsquo;&quot;,
respectively. By default, characters with their high bit set
are printed verbatim.</p>

<p>&quot;UsageOnly&quot; Rudimentary per-package memory
usage dump. Calculates total size of strings found in
variables in the package. This does not include lexicals in
a module s file scope, or lost in closures.</p>

<p>After the rc file is read, the debugger reads the
$ENV{PERLDB_OPTS} environment variable and parses this as
the remainder of a &quot;O ...&quot; line as one might enter
at the debugger prompt. You may place the initialization
options &quot;TTY&quot;, &quot;noTTY&quot;,
&quot;ReadLine&quot;, and &quot;NonStop&quot; there.</p>

<p>If your rc file contains:</p>

<p>parse_options(&quot;NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out
AutoTrace&quot;);</p>

<p>then your script will run without human intervention,
putting trace information into the file db.out. (If you
interrupt it, youd better reset &quot;LineInfo&quot; to
/dev/tty if you expect to see anything.)</p>

<p>&quot;TTY&quot; The TTY to use for debugging I/O.</p>

<p>&quot;noTTY&quot; If set, the debugger goes into
&quot;NonStop&quot; mode and will not connect to a TTY. If
interrupted (or if control goes to the debugger via explicit
setting of $DB::signal or $DB::single from the Perl script),
it connects to a TTY specified in the &quot;TTY&quot; option
at startup, or to a tty found at runtime using the
&quot;Term::Rendezvous&quot; module of your choice.</p>

<p>This module should implement a method named
&quot;new&quot; that returns an object with two methods:
&quot;IN&quot; and &quot;OUT&quot;. These should return
filehandles to use for debugging input and output
correspondingly. The &quot;new&quot; method should inspect
an argument containing the value of $ENV{PERLDB_NOTTY} at
startup, or &quot;$ENV{HOME}/.perldbtty$$&quot; otherwise.
This file is not inspected for proper ownership, so security
hazards are theoretically possible.</p>

<p>&quot;ReadLine&quot; If false, readline support in the
debugger is disabled in order to debug applications that
themselves use ReadLine.</p>

<p>&quot;NonStop&quot; If set, the debugger goes into
non-interactive mode until interrupted, or programmatically
by setting $DB::signal or $DB::single.</p>

<p>Heres an example of using the $ENV{PERLDB_OPTS}
variable:</p>

<p>$ PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop frame=2&quot; perl -d
myprogram</p>

<p>That will run the script myprogram without human
intervention, printing out the call tree with entry and exit
points. Note that &quot;NonStop=1 frame=2&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;N f=2&quot;, and that originally,
options could be uniquely abbreviated by the first letter
(modulo the &quot;Dump*&quot; options). It is nevertheless
recommended that you always spell them out in full for
legibility and future compatibility.</p>

<p>Other examples include</p>

<p>$ PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop LineInfo=listing
frame=2&quot; perl -d myprogram</p>

<p>which runs script non-interactively, printing info on
each entry into a subroutine and each executed line into the
file named listing. (If you interrupt it, you would better
reset &quot;LineInfo&quot; to something
&quot;interactive&quot;!)</p>

<p>Other examples include (using standard shell syntax to
show environment variable settings):</p>

<p>$ ( PERLDB_OPTS=&quot;NonStop frame=1 AutoTrace
LineInfo=tperl.out&quot; perl -d myprogram )</p>

<p>which may be useful for debugging a program that uses
&quot;Term::ReadLine&quot; itself. Do not forget to detach
your shell from the TTY in the window that corresponds to
/dev/ttyXX, say, by issuing a command like</p>

<p>$ sleep 1000000</p>

<p>See &quot;Debugger Internals&quot; in perldebguts for
details.</p>

<p>Debugger input/output Prompt The debugger prompt is
something like</p>

<p>DB&lt;8&gt;</p>

<p>or even</p>

<p>DB&lt;&lt;17&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>where that number is the command number, and which youd
use to access with the built-in csh-like history mechanism.
For example, &quot;!17&quot; would repeat command number 17.
The depth of the angle brackets indicates the nesting depth
of the debugger. You could get more than one set of
brackets, for example, if youd already at a breakpoint and
then printed the result of a function call that itself has a
breakpoint, or you step into an expression via &quot;s/n/t
expression&quot; command.</p>

<p>Multiline commands If you want to enter a multi-line
command, such as a subroutine definition with several
statements or a format, escape the newline that would
normally end the debugger command with a backslash. Heres an
example:</p>

<p>DB&lt;1&gt; for (1..4) { cont: print &quot;ok0; cont: }
ok ok ok ok</p>

<p>Note that this business of escaping a newline is
specific to interactive commands typed into the
debugger.</p>

<p>Stack backtrace Heres an example of what a stack
backtrace via &quot;T&quot; command might look like:</p>

<p>$ = main::infested called from file
&lsquo;Ambulation.pm&rsquo; line 10 @ = Ambulation::legs(1,
2, 3, 4) called from file &lsquo;camel_flea&rsquo; line 7 $
= main::pests(&rsquo;bactrian&rsquo;, 4) called from file
&lsquo;camel_flea&rsquo; line 4</p>

<p>The left-hand character up there indicates the context
in which the function was called, with &quot;$&quot; and
&quot;@&quot; meaning scalar or list contexts respectively,
and &quot;.&quot; meaning void context (which is actually a
sort of scalar context). The display above says that you
were in the function &quot;main::infested&quot; when you ran
the stack dump, and that it was called in scalar context
from line 10 of the file Ambulation.pm, but without any
arguments at all, meaning it was called as &amp;infested.
The next stack frame shows that the function
&quot;Ambulation::legs&quot; was called in list context from
the camel_flea file with four arguments. The last stack
frame shows that &quot;main::pests&quot; was called in
scalar context, also from camel_flea, but from line 4.</p>

<p>If you execute the &quot;T&quot; command from inside an
active &quot;use&quot; statement, the backtrace will contain
both a &quot;require&quot; frame and an &quot;eval&quot;)
frame.</p>

<p>Line Listing Format This shows the sorts of output the
&quot;l&quot; command can produce:</p>

<p>DB&lt;&lt;13&gt;&gt; l 101: @i{@i} = (); 102:b
@isa{@i,$pack} = () 103 if(exists $i{$prevpack} || exists
$isa{$pack}); 104 } 105 106 next 107==&gt; if(exists
$isa{$pack}); 108 109:a if ($extra-- &gt; 0) { 110: %isa =
($pack,1);</p>

<p>Breakable lines are marked with &quot;:&quot;. Lines
with breakpoints are marked by &quot;b&quot; and those with
actions by &quot;a&quot;. The line thats about to be
executed is marked by &quot;==&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>Please be aware that code in debugger listings may not
look the same as your original source code. Line directives
and external source filters can alter the code before Perl
sees it, causing code to move from its original positions or
take on entirely different forms.</p>

<p>Frame listing When the &quot;frame&quot; option is set,
the debugger would print entered (and optionally exited)
subroutines in different styles. See perldebguts for
incredibly long examples of these.</p>

<p>Debugging compile-time statements If you have
compile-time executable statements (such as code within
BEGIN, UNITCHECK and CHECK blocks or &quot;use&quot;
statements), these will not be stopped by debugger, although
&quot;require&quot;s and INIT blocks will, and compile-time
statements can be traced with &quot;AutoTrace&quot; option
set in &quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;). From your own Perl code,
however, you can transfer control back to the debugger using
the following statement, which is harmless if the debugger
is not running:</p>

<p>$DB::single = 1;</p>

<p>If you set $DB::single to 2, its equivalent to having
just typed the &quot;n&quot; command, whereas a value of 1
means the &quot;s&quot; command. The $DB::trace variable
should be set to 1 to simulate having typed the
&quot;t&quot; command.</p>

<p>Another way to debug compile-time code is to start the
debugger, set a breakpoint on the load of some module:</p>

<p>DB&lt;7&gt; b load f:/perllib/lib/Carp.pm Will stop on
load of &lsquo;f:/perllib/lib/Carp.pm&rsquo;.</p>

<p>and then restart the debugger using the &quot;R&quot;
command (if possible). One can use &quot;b compile
subname&quot; for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Debugger Customization The debugger probably contains
enough configuration hooks that you won t ever have to
modify it yourself. You may change the behaviour of debugger
from within the debugger using its &quot;o&quot; command,
from the command line via the &quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;
environment variable, and from customization files.</p>

<p>You can do some customization by setting up a .perldb
file, which contains initialization code. For instance, you
could make aliases like these (the last one is one people
expect to be there):</p>

<p>$DB::alias{&rsquo;len&rsquo;} = &rsquo;s/^len(.*)/p
length($1)/&rsquo;; $DB::alias{&rsquo;stop&rsquo;} =
&rsquo;s/^stop (at|in)/b/&rsquo;; p s c
$DB::alias{&rsquo;ps&rsquo;} = &rsquo;s/^psa&rsquo;; l a r
$DB::alias{&rsquo;quit&rsquo;} =
&rsquo;s/^quit()/exit/&rsquo;;</p>

<p>You can change options from .perldb by using calls like
this one;</p>

<p>parse_options(&quot;NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out
AutoTrace=1 frame=2&quot;);</p>

<p>The code is executed in the package &quot;DB&quot;. Note
that .perldb is processed before processing
&quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;. If .perldb defines the subroutine
&quot;afterinit&quot;, that function is called after
debugger initialization ends. .perldb may be contained in
the current directory, or in the home directory. Because
this file is sourced in by Perl and may contain arbitrary
commands, for security reasons, it must be owned by the
superuser or the current user, and writable by no one but
its owner.</p>

<p>You can mock TTY input to debugger by adding arbitrary
commands to @DB::typeahead. For example, your .perldb file
might contain:</p>

<p>sub afterinit { push @DB::typeahead, &quot;b 4&quot;,
&quot;b 6&quot;; }</p>

<p>Which would attempt to set breakpoints on lines 4 and 6
immediately after debugger initialization. Note that
@DB::typeahead is not a supported interface and is subject
to change in future releases.</p>

<p>If you want to modify the debugger, copy perl5db.pl from
the Perl library to another name and hack it to your heart s
content. Youll then want to set your &quot;PERL5DB&quot;
environment variable to say something like this:</p>

<p>BEGIN { require &quot;myperl5db.pl&quot; }</p>

<p>As a last resort, you could also use &quot;PERL5DB&quot;
to customize the debugger by directly setting internal
variables or calling debugger functions.</p>

<p>Note that any variables and functions that are not
documented in this document (or in perldebguts) are
considered for internal use only, and as such are subject to
change without notice.</p>

<p>Readline Support / History in the debugger As shipped,
the only command-line history supplied is a simplistic one
that checks for leading exclamation points. However, if you
install the Term::ReadKey and Term::ReadLine modules from
CPAN (such as Term::ReadLine::Gnu, Term::ReadLine::Perl,
...) you will have full editing capabilities much like GNU
readline(3) provides. Look for these in the
modules/by-module/Term directory on CPAN. These do not
support normal vi command-line editing, however.</p>

<p>A rudimentary command-line completion is also available.
Unfortunately, the names of lexical variables are not
available for completion.</p>

<p>Without Readline support you may see the symbols
&quot;^[[A&quot;, &quot;^[[C&quot;, &quot;^[[B&quot;,
&quot;^[[D&quot;&quot;, &quot;^H&quot;, ... when using the
arrow keys and/or the backspace key.</p>

<p>Editor Support for Debugging If you have the FSFs
version of emacs installed on your system, it can interact
with the Perl debugger to provide an integrated software
development environment reminiscent of its interactions with
C debuggers.</p>

<p>Perl comes with a start file for making emacs act like a
syntax- directed editor that understands (some of) Perls
syntax. Look in the emacs directory of the Perl source
distribution.</p>

<p>A similar setup by Tom Christiansen for interacting with
any vendor- shipped vi and the X11 window system is also
available. This works similarly to the integrated
multiwindow support that emacs provides, where the debugger
drives the editor. At the time of this writing, however,
that tool s eventual location in the Perl distribution was
uncertain.</p>

<p>Users of vi should also look into vim and gvim, the
mousey and windy version, for coloring of Perl keywords.</p>

<p>Note that only perl can truly parse Perl, so all such
CASE tools fall somewhat short of the mark, especially if
you dont program your Perl as a C programmer might.</p>

<p>The Perl Profiler If you wish to supply an alternative
debugger for Perl to run, just invoke your script with a
colon and a package argument given to the -d flag. The most
popular alternative debuggers for Perl is the Perl profiler.
Devel::DProf is included with the standard Perl
distribution. To profile your Perl program in the file
mycode.pl, just type:</p>

<p>$ perl -d:DProf mycode.pl</p>

<p>When the script terminates the profiler will dump the
profile information to a file called tmon.out. A tool like
dprofpp, also supplied with the standard Perl distribution,
can be used to interpret the information in that profile.
More powerful profilers, such as &quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot;
are available from the CPAN.</p>

<p>Debugging regular expressions &quot;use re
&rsquo;debug&rsquo;&quot; enables you to see the gory
details of how the Perl regular expression engine works. In
order to understand this typically voluminous output, one
must not only have some idea about how regular expression
matching works in general, but also know how Perls regular
expressions are internally compiled into an automaton. These
matters are explored in some detail in &quot;Debugging
regular expressions&quot; in perldebguts.</p>

<p>Debugging memory usage Perl contains internal support
for reporting its own memory usage, but this is a fairly
advanced concept that requires some understanding of how
memory allocation works. See &quot;Debugging Perl memory
usage&quot; in perldebguts for the details.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO You did try the -w switch, didnt you?</p>

<p>perldebtut, perldebguts, re, DB, Devel::DProf, dprofpp,
Dumpvalue, and perlrun.</p>

<p>When debugging a script that uses #! and is thus
normally found in $PATH, the -S option causes perl to search
$PATH for it, so you dont have to type the path or
&quot;which $scriptname&quot;.</p>

<p>$ perl -Sd foo.pl</p>

<p>BUGS You cannot get stack frame information or in any
fashion debug functions that were not compiled by Perl, such
as those from C or C++ extensions.</p>

<p>If you alter your @_ arguments in a subroutine (such as
with &quot;shift&quot; or &quot;pop&quot;), the stack
backtrace will not show the original values.</p>

<p>The debugger does not currently work in conjunction with
the -W command-line switch, because it itself is not free of
warnings.</p>

<p>If you re in a slow syscall (like &quot;wait&quot;ing,
&quot;accept&quot;ing, or &quot;read&quot;ing from your
keyboard or a socket) and havent set up your own $SIG{INT}
handler, then you wont be able to CTRL-C your way back to
the debugger, because the debugger s own $SIG{INT} handler
doesnt understand that it needs to raise an exception to
longjmp(3) out of slow syscalls.</p>
