<p>CAL(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CAL(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cal - print a calendar</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cal [[month] year ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cal utility shall write a calendar to
standard output using the Julian calendar for dates from
January 1, 1 through September 2, 1752 and the Gregorian
calendar for dates from September 14, 1752 through December
31, 9999 as though the Gregorian calendar had been adopted
on September 14, 1752.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>month Specify the month to be displayed, represented as
a decimal integer from 1 (January) to 12 (December). The
default shall be the current month.</p>

<p>year Specify the year for which the calendar is
displayed, repre- sented as a decimal integer from 1 to
9999. The default shall be the current year.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of cal:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error, and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format and contents of the
calendar.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used to calculate the value of
the cur- rent month.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be used to display the
calendar, in an unspecified format.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Note that:</p>

<p>cal 83</p>

<p>refers to A.D. 83, not 1983.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS A future version of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 may support locale-specific recognition of the
date of adoption of the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO None.</p>
