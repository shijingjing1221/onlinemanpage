<p>NAME ldns-keyfetcher - retrieve the DNSSEC DNSKEYs for a
zone</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-keyfetcher [ OPTIONS ] DOMAIN</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-keyfetcher is used to retrieve the
DNSKEYs of a zone.</p>

<p>First it finds all authoritative nameservers of the zone
by tracing it from the root down. All authoritative
nameservers are then queried (using TCP) for the DNSKEY
RRset of the zone apex. If the results are all the same, the
key resource record set is printed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -4 Only use IPv4</p>

<p>-6 Only use IPv6</p>

<p>-h Show a help text and exit</p>

<p>-i Insecurer mode; there will only be one query for the
DNSKEYS. There will not be crosschecking of all
authoritative nameservers.</p>

<p>-v verbosity</p>

<p>Set the verbosity level. The following levels are
available:</p>

<p>0: default, only print the DNSKEY RRset found, or an
error on failure. 1: Show the nameservers that are queried
2: Show more info on what is checked 3: Show the
intermediate results (authority and dnskey rrsets) 4: Print
the answer packets that are returned</p>

<p>-r file</p>

<p>Use file as the root hints file, should contain A
records in presenta- tion format. The default is
/etc/named.root. You can get this file from
http://www.internic.net/zones/named.root.</p>

<p>-s Dont print the keys to stdout, but store them in
files.</p>

<p>The filenames will be of the format
K&lt;file&gt;.+&lt;alg&gt;.+&lt;keytag&gt;.key</p>
