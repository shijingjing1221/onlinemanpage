<p>NAME mwm The Motif Window Manager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mwm [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mwm window manager provides functions
that facilitate control (by the user and the programmer) of
elements of window state such as place- ment, size,
icon/normal display, and input-focus ownership.</p>

<p>The stand-alone window manager is not an integral part
of CDE and does not support communication with other
components in the CDE environment, such as the Style Manager
and the Session Manager.</p>

<p>Options -display display This option specifies the
display to use; see X(1).</p>

<p>-xrm resourcestring This option specifies a resource
string to use.</p>

<p>-multiscreen This option causes mwm to manage all
screens on the display. The default is to manage only a
single screen.</p>

<p>-name name This option causes mwm to retrieve its
resources using the specified name, as in name*resource.</p>

<p>-screens name [name [...]] This option specifies the
resource names to use for the screens managed by mwm. If mwm
is managing a single screen, only the first name in the list
is used. If mwm is managing multiple screens, the names are
assigned to the screens in order, starting with screen 0.
Screen 0 gets the first name, screen 1 the second name, and
so on.</p>

<p>Appearance The following sections describe the basic
default behaviors of windows, icons, the icon box, input
focus, and window stacking. The appearance and behavior of
the window manager can be altered by changing the con-
figuration of specific resources. Resources are defined
under the head- ing &quot;X DEFAULTS.&quot;</p>

<p>Screens By default, mwm manages only the single screen
specified by the -dis- play option or the DISPLAY
environment variable (by default, screen 0). If the
-multiscreen option is specified or if the multiScreen
resource is True, mwm tries to manage all the screens on the
display.</p>

<p>When mwm is managing multiple screens, the -screens
option can be used to give each screen a unique resource
name. The names are separated by blanks, for example,
-screens scr0 scr1. If there are more screens than names,
resources for the remaining screens will be retrieved using
the first name. By default, the screen number is used for
the screen name.</p>

<p>Windows Default mwm window frames have distinct
components with associated functions:</p>

<p>Title Area In addition to displaying the client s title,
the title area is used to move the window. To move the
window, place the pointer over the title area, press button
1 and drag the win- dow to a new location. By default, a
wire frame is moved dur- ing the drag to indicate the new
location. When the button is released, the window is moved
to the new location.</p>

<p>Title Bar The title bar includes the title area, the
minimize button, the maximize button, and the window menu
button. In shaped windows, such as round windows, the title
bar floats above the window.</p>

<p>Minimize Button To turn the window into an icon, click
button 1 on the mini- mize button (the frame box with a
small square in it).</p>

<p>Maximize Button To make the window fill the screen (or
enlarge to the largest size allowed by the configuration
files), click button 1 on the maximize button (the frame box
with a large square in it).</p>

<p>Window Menu Button The window menu button is the frame
box with a horizontal bar in it. To pull down the window
menu, press button 1. While pressing, drag the pointer on
the menu to your selection, then release the button when
your selection is highlighted. Pressing button 3 in the
title bar or resize border handles also posts the window
menu. Alternately, you can click button 1 to pull down the
menu and keep it posted; then position the pointer and
select. You can also post the window menu by pressing
&lt;Shift&gt; &lt;Esc&gt; or &lt;Alt&gt; &lt;Space&gt;.
Double-clicking button 1 with the pointer on the window menu
button closes the window.</p>

<p>The following table lists the contents of the window
menu.</p>

<p>Default Window Menu Selection Accelerator Description
Restore Restores the window to its size before minimizing or
maximizing. Move Allows the window to be moved with keys or
mouse. Size Allows the window to be resized. Minimize Turns
the window into an icon. Maximize Makes the window fill the
screen. Lower Moves window to bottom of window stack. Close
Alt+F4 Causes client to terminate.</p>

<p>Resize Border Handles To change the size of a window,
move the pointer over a resize border handle (the cursor
changes), press button 1, and drag the window to a new size.
When the button is released, the window is resized. While
dragging is being done, a rubber-band outline is displayed
to indicate the new window size.</p>

<p>Matte An optional matte decoration can be added between
the client area and the window frame (see the matteWidth
resource). A matte is not actually part of the window frame.
There is no functionality associated with a matte.</p>

<p>Icons Icons are small graphic representations of
windows. A window can be minimized (iconified) using the
minimize button on the window frame. Icons provide a way to
reduce clutter on the screen.</p>

<p>Pressing mouse button 1 when the pointer is over an icon
causes the icons window menu to pop up. Releasing the button
(press + release without moving mouse = click) causes the
menu to stay posted. The menu contains the following
selections:</p>

<p>Icon Window Menu Selection Accelerator Description
Restore Opens the associated window. Move Allows the icon to
be moved with keys. Size Inactive (not an option for icons).
Minimize Inactive (not an option for icons). Maximize Opens
the associated window and makes it fill the screen. Lower
Moves icon to bottom of icon stack. Close Alt+F4 Removes
client from mwm management.</p>

<p>Note that pressing button 3 over an icon also causes the
icons window menu to pop up. To make a menu selection, drag
the pointer over the menu and release button 3 when the
desired item is highlighted.</p>

<p>Double-clicking button 1 on an icon invokes the
f.restore_and_raise function and restores the icons
associated window to its previous state. For example, if a
maximized window is iconified, double-clicking button 1
restores it to its maximized state. Double-clicking button 1
on the icon boxs icon opens the icon box and allows access
to the con- tained icons. (In general, double-clicking a
mouse button is a quick way to perform a function.) Pressing
&lt;Shift&gt; &lt;Esc&gt; or &lt;Menu&gt; (the pop- up menu
key) causes the icon window menu of the currently selected
icon to pop up.</p>

<p>Icon Box When icons begin to clutter the screen, they
can be packed into an icon box. (To use an icon box, mwm
must be started with the icon box config- uration already
set.) The icon box is a mwm window that holds client icons.
It includes one or more scroll bars when there are more
window icons than the icon box can show at the same
time.</p>

<p>Icons in the icon box can be manipulated with the mouse.
The following table summarizes the behavior of this
interface. Button actions apply whenever the pointer is on
any part of the icon. Note that double- clicking an icon in
the icon box invokes the f.restore_and_raise func- tion.</p>

<p>Button Action Description Button 1 click Selects the
icon. Button 1 double-click Normalizes (opens) the
associated window. Raises an already open win- dow to the
top of the stack. Button 1 drag Moves the icon. Button 3
press Causes the menu for that icon to pop up. Button 3 drag
Highlights items as the pointer moves across the menu.</p>

<p>Pressing mouse button 3 when the pointer is over an icon
causes the menu for that icon to pop up.</p>

<p>Icon Menu for the Icon Box Selection Accelerator
Description Restore Opens the associated window (if not
already open). Move Allows the icon to be moved with keys.
Size Inactive. Minimize Inactive. Maximize Opens the
associated window (if not already open) and maximizes its
size.</p>

<p>Lower Inactive. Close Alt+F4 Removes client from mwm
management.</p>

<p>To pull down the window menu for the icon box itself,
press button 1 with the pointer over the menu button for the
icon box. The window menu of the icon box differs from the
window menu of a client window: The &quot;Close&quot;
selection is replaced with the &quot;PackIcons
Shift+Alt+F7&quot; selec- tion. When selected, PackIcons
packs the icons in the box to achieve neat rows with no
empty slots.</p>

<p>You can also post the window menu by pressing
&lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Esc&gt; or &lt;Alt&gt; &lt;Space&gt;.
Pressing &lt;Menu&gt; (the pop-up menu key) causes the icon
window menu of the currently selected icon to pop up.</p>

<p>Input Focus The mwm window manager supports (by default)
a keyboard input focus policy of explicit selection. This
means when a window is selected to get keyboard input, it
continues to get keyboard input until the window is
withdrawn from window management, another window is
explicitly selected to get keyboard input, or the window is
iconified. Several resources control the input focus. The
client window with the keyboard input focus has the active
window appearance with a visually distinct window frame.</p>

<p>The following tables summarize the keyboard input focus
selection behavior:</p>

<p>Button Action Object Function Description Button 1 press
Window / window frame Keyboard focus selection. Button 1
press Icon Keyboard focus selection.</p>

<p>Key Action Function Description [Alt][Tab] Move input
focus to next window in window stack (available only in
explicit focus mode). [Alt][Shift][Tab] Move input focus to
previous window in window stack (available only in explicit
focus mode).</p>

<p>Window Stacking There are two types of window stacks:
global window stacks and an applications local family window
stack.</p>

<p>The global stacking order of windows may be changed as a
result of set- ting the keyboard input focus, iconifying a
window, or performing a window manager window stacking
function. When keyboard focus policy is explicit the default
value of the focusAutoRaise resource is True. This causes a
window to be raised to the top of the stack when it receives
input focus, for example, by pressing button 1 on the title
bar. The key actions defined in the previous table will thus
raise the window receiving focus to the top of the
stack.</p>

<p>In pointer mode, the default value of focusAutoRaise is
False, that is, the window stacking order is not changed
when a window receives key- board input focus. The following
key actions can be used to cycle through the global window
stack.</p>

<p>Key Action Function Description [Alt][ESC] Place top
window on bottom of stack. [Alt][Shift][ESC] Place bottom
window on top of stack.</p>

<p>By default, a windows icon is placed on the bottom of
the stack when the window is iconified; however, the default
can be changed by the lowerOnIconify resource.</p>

<p>Transient windows (secondary windows such a dialog
boxes) stay above their parent windows by default; however,
an applications local family stacking order may be changed
to allow a transient window to be placed below its parent
top-level window. The following arguments show the
modification of the stacking order for the f.lower
function.</p>

<p>f.lower Lowers the transient window within the family
(staying above the parent) and lowers the family in the
global window stack.</p>

<p>f.lower [ within] Lowers the transient window within the
family (staying above the parent) but does not lower the
family in the global win- dow stack.</p>

<p>f.lower [freeFamily ] Lowers the window free from its
family stack (below the par- ent), but does not lower the
family in the global window stack.</p>

<p>The arguments within and freeFamily can also be used
with f.raise and f.raise_lower.</p>

<p>Session Management The window manager is an X Session
Management Protocol aware client. It responds to
SaveYourself (and other associated messages) by saving the
geometries of its clients to a state file. mwm can then be
restarted by the XSMP session manager. The default location
for the state file is $HOME/.mwmclientdb. This location can
be overriden with the resource sessionClientDB.</p>

<p>X Resources The mwm command is configured from its
resource database. This database is built from the following
sources. They are listed in order of prece- dence, low to
high:</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Mwm</p>

<p>$HOME/Mwm</p>

<p>RESOURCE_MANAGER root window property or
$HOME/.Xdefaults</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT variable or $HOME/.Xdefaults-host</p>

<p>mwm command line options</p>

<p>The file names /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/Mwm and
$HOME/Mwm represent customary locations for these files. The
actual location of the system- wide class resource file may
depend on the XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable and the
current language environment. The actual location of the
user-specific class resource file may depend on the
XUSERFILE- SEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR environment variables
and the current lan- guage environment.</p>

<p>Entries in the resource database may refer to other
resource files for specific types of resources. These
include files that contain bitmaps, fonts, and mwm specific
resources such as menus and behavior specifica- tions (for
example, button and key bindings).</p>

<p>Mwm is the resource class name of mwm and mwm is the
default resource name used by mwm to look up resources. the
-screens command line option specifies resource names, such
as &quot;mwm_b+w&quot; and &quot;mwm_color&quot;.) In the
following discussion of resource specification,
&quot;Mwm&quot; and &quot;mwm&quot; (and the aliased mwm
resource names) can be used interchangeably, but
&quot;mwm&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Mwm&quot;.</p>

<p>The mwm command uses the following types of
resources:</p>

<p>Component Appearance Resources: These resources specify
appearance attributes of window man- ager user interface
components. They can be applied to the appearance of window
manager menus, feedback windows (for example, the window
reconfiguration feedback window), client window frames, and
icons.</p>

<p>General Appearance and Behavior Resources: These
resources specify mwm appearance and behavior (for example,
window management policies). They are not set sepa- rately
for different mwm user interface components. They apply to
all screens and workspaces.</p>

<p>Screen Specific Appearance and Behavior Resources: These
resources specify the appearance and behavior of mwm
elements that are settable on a per-screen basis.</p>

<p>Client Specific Resources: These mwm resources can be
set for a particular client window or class of client
windows. They specify client-specific icon and client window
frame appearance and behavior.</p>

<p>Resource identifiers can be either a resource name (for
example, fore- ground) or a resource class (for example,
Foreground). If the value of a resource is a filename and if
the filename is prefixed by &quot;~/&quot;, then it is
relative to the path contained in the HOME environment
variable (generally the users home directory).</p>

<p>Component Appearance Resources The syntax for specifying
component appearance resources that apply to window manager
icons, menus, and client window frames is Mwm*
resource_id</p>

<p>For example, Mwm*foreground is used to specify the
foreground color for mwm menus, icons, client window frames,
and feedback dialogs.</p>

<p>The syntax for specifying component appearance resources
that apply to a particular mwm component is
Mwm*[menu|icon|client|feedback] *resource_id</p>

<p>If menu is specified, the resource is applied only to
mwm menus; if icon is specified, the resource is applied to
icons; and if client is specified, the resource is applied
to client window frames. For exam- ple, Mwm*icon*foreground
is used to specify the foreground color for mwm icons,
Mwm*menu*foreground specifies the foreground color for mwm
menus, and Mwm*client*foreground is used to specify the
foreground color for mwm client window frames.</p>

<p>The appearance of the title area of a client window
frame (including window management buttons) can be
separately configured. The syntax for configuring the title
area of a client window frame is Mwm*client*title*
resource_id</p>

<p>For example, Mwm*client*title*foreground specifies the
foreground color for the title area. Defaults for title area
resources are based on the values of the corresponding
client window frame resources.</p>

<p>The appearance of menus can be configured based on the
name of the menu. The syntax for specifying menu appearance
by name is Mwm*menu* menu_name*resource_id</p>

<p>For example, Mwm*menu*my_menu*foreground specifies the
foreground color for the menu named my_menu. The user can
also specify resources for window manager menu components,
that is, the gadgets that comprise the menu. These may
include for example, a menu title, title separator, one or
more buttons, and separators. If a menu contains more than
one instance of a class, such as multiple PushButtonGadgets,
the name of the first instance is
&quot;PushButtonGadget1&quot;, the second is
&quot;PushButton- Gadget2&quot;, and so on. The following
list identifies the naming conven- tion used for window
manager menu components:</p>

<p>&middot; Menu Title LabelGadget -
&quot;TitleName&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Menu Title SeparatorGadget -
&quot;TitleSeparator&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; CascadeButtonGadget -
&quot;CascadeButtonGadget&lt;n&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; PushButtonGadget -
&quot;PushButtonGadget&lt;n&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; SeparatorGadget -
&quot;SeparatorGadget&lt;n&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Refer to the man page for each class for a list of
resources that can be specified.</p>

<p>The following component appearance resources that apply
to all window manager parts can be specified:</p>

<p>Component Appearance Resources - All Window Manager

<p>The default is chosen based on the visual type of the
screen. Image name. See XmInstallImage(3). X11 X Logical
Font Description</p>

<p>background (class Background) This resource specifies
the background color. Any legal X color may be specified.
The default value is chosen based on the visual type of the
screen.</p>

<p>backgroundPixmap (class BackgroundPixmap) This resource
specifies the background Pixmap of the mwm dec- oration when
the window is inactive (does not have the key- board focus).
The default value is chosen based on the visual type of the
screen.</p>

<p>bottomShadowColor (class Foreground) This resource
specifies the bottom shadow color. This color is used for
the lower and right bevels of the window manager decoration.
Any legal X color may be specified. The default value is
chosen based on the visual type of the screen.</p>

<p>bottomShadowPixmap (class BottomShadowPixmap) This
resource specifies the bottom shadow Pixmap. This Pixmap is
used for the lower and right bevels of the window manager
decoration. The default is chosen based on the visual type
of the screen.</p>

<p>fontList (class FontList) This resource specifies the
font used in the window manager decoration. The character
encoding of the font should match the character encoding of
the strings that are used. The default is
&quot;fixed.&quot;</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) This resource specifies
the foreground color. The default is chosen based on the
visual type of the screen.</p>

<p>saveUnder (class SaveUnder) This is used to indicate
whether &quot;save unders&quot; are used for mwm components.
For this to have any effect, save unders must be implemented
by the X server. If save unders are imple- mented, the X
server saves the contents of windows obscured by windows
that have the save under attribute set. If the saveUnder
resource is True, mwm will set the save under attribute on
the window manager frame of any client that has it set. If
saveUnder is False, save unders will not be used on any
window manager frames. The default value is False.</p>

<p>topShadowColor (class Background) This resource
specifies the top shadow color. This color is used for the
upper and left bevels of the window manager dec- oration.
The default is chosen based on the visual type of the
screen.</p>

<p>topShadowPixmap ( class TopShadowPixmap) This resource
specifies the top shadow Pixmap. This Pixmap is used for the
upper and left bevels of the window manager dec- oration.
The default is chosen based on the visual type of the
screen.</p>

<p>The following component appearance resources that apply
to frame and icons can be specified:</p>

<p>The default is chosen based on the visual type of the
screen. See XmInstallImage(3).</p>

<p>activeBackground (class Background) This resource
specifies the background color of the mwm deco- ration when
the window is active (has the keyboard focus). The default
is chosen based on the visual type of the screen.</p>

<p>activeBackgroundPixmap (class ActiveBackgroundPixmap)
This resource specifies the background Pixmap of the mwm
dec- oration when the window is active (has the keyboard
focus). The default is chosen based on the visual type of
the screen.</p>

<p>activeBottomShadowColor (class Foreground) This resource
specifies the bottom shadow color of the mwm decoration when
the window is active (has the keyboard focus). The default
is chosen based on the visual type of the screen.</p>

<p>activeBottomShadowPixmap (class BottomShadowPixmap) This
resource specifies the bottom shadow Pixmap of the mwm
decoration when the window is active (has the keyboard
focus). The default is chosen based on the visual type of
the screen.</p>

<p>activeForeground (class Foreground) This resource
specifies the foreground color of the mwm deco- ration when
the window is active (has the keyboard focus). The default
is chosen based on the visual type of the screen.</p>

<p>activeTopShadowColor (class Background) This resource
specifies the top shadow color of the mwm deco- ration when
the window is active (has the keyboard focus). The default
is chosen based on the visual type of the screen.</p>

<p>General Appearance and Behavior Resources The syntax for
specifying general appearance and behavior resources is
Mwm*resource_id</p>

<p>For example, Mwm*keyboardFocusPolicy specifies the
window manager pol- icy for setting the keyboard focus to a
particular client window.</p>

<p>The following general appearance and behavior resources
can be speci- fied:</p>

<p>General Appearance and Behavior Resources Name Class

T wMenuButtonClick2 WMenuButtonClick2 T/F T</p>

<p>The resource doubleClickTime is included for backward
compatibility. Use of the Xt resource multiClickTime is
preferred.</p>

<p>autoKeyFocus (class AutoKeyFocus) This resource is
available only when the keyboard input focus policy is
explicit. If autoKeyFocus is given a value of True, then
when a window with the keyboard input focus is withdrawn
from window management or is iconified, the focus is set to
the previous window that had the focus. If the value given
is False, there is no automatic setting of the keyboard
input focus. It is recommended that both autoKeyFocus and
startup- KeyFocus be True to work with tear off menus. The
default value is True.</p>

<p>autoRaiseDelay (class AutoRaiseDelay) This resource is
available only when the focusAutoRaise resource is True and
the keyboard focus policy is pointer. The autoRaiseDelay
resource specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) that
mwm will wait before raising a window after it gets the
keyboard focus. The default value of this resource is 500
(ms).</p>

<p>bitmapDirectory (class BitmapDirectory) This resource
identifies a directory to be searched for bitmaps referenced
by mwm resources. This directory is searched if a bitmap is
specified without an absolute path- name. The default value
for this resource is /usr/include/X11/bitmaps. The directory
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps represents the customary locations
for this directory. The actual location of this directory
may vary on some systems. If the bitmap is not found in the
spec- ified directory, XBMLANGPATH is searched.</p>

<p>clientAutoPlace (class ClientAutoPlace) This resource
determines the position of a window when the window has not
been given a program- or user-specified posi- tion. With a
value of True, windows are positioned with the top left
corners of the frames offset horizontally and verti- cally.
A value of False causes the currently configured posi- tion
of the window to be used. In either case, mwm will attempt
to place the windows totally on-screen. The default value is
True.</p>

<p>colormapFocusPolicy (class ColormapFocusPolicy) This
resource indicates the colormap focus policy that is to be
used. If the resource value is explicit, a colormap
selection action is done on a client window to set the col-
ormap focus to that window. If the value is pointer, the
client window containing the pointer has the colormap focus.
If the value is keyboard, the client window that has the
key- board input focus has the colormap focus. The default
value for this resource is keyboard.</p>

<p>configFile (class ConfigFile) The resource value is the
pathname for a mwm resource description file. If the
pathname begins with &quot;~/&quot;, mwm con- siders it to
be relative to the users home directory (as specified by the
HOME environment variable). If the LANG environment variable
is set, mwm looks for $HOME/$LANG/ con- figFile. If that
file does not exist or if LANG is not set, mwm looks for
$HOME/configFile. If the configFile pathname does not begin
with &quot;~/&quot; or &quot;/&quot;, mwm considers it to be
rela- tive to the current working directory. If the
configFile resource is not specified or if that file does
not exist, mwm uses several default paths to find a
configuration file. The order of the search is shown below:
/etc/X11/mwm/$LANG/sys- tem.mwmrc /etc/X11/mwm/system.mwmrc
Paths marked with are implementation dependent.</p>

<p>deiconifyKeyFocus (class DeiconifyKeyFocus) This
resource applies only when the keyboard input focus pol- icy
is explicit. If a value of True is used, a window receives
the keyboard input focus when it is normalized
(deiconified). True is the default value.</p>

<p>doubleClickTime (class DoubleClickTime) This resource is
used to set the maximum time (in ms) between the clicks
(button presses) that make up a double-click. The use of
this resource is deprecated. Use the Xt resource mul-
tiClickTime instead. The value of doubleClickTime dynami-
cally defaults to the value of multiClickTime.</p>

<p>enableWarp (class EnableWarp) The default value of this
resource, True, causes mwm to warp the pointer to the center
of the selected window during key- board-controlled resize
and move operations. Setting the value to False causes mwm
to leave the pointer at its origi- nal place on the screen,
unless the user explicitly moves it with the cursor keys or
pointing device.</p>

<p>enforceKeyFocus (class EnforceKeyFocus) If this resource
is given a value of True, the keyboard input focus is always
explicitly set to selected windows even if there is an
indication that they are &quot;globally active&quot; input
windows. (An example of a globally active window is a scroll
bar that can be operated without setting the focus to that
client.) If the resource is False, the keyboard input focus
is not explicitly set to globally active windows. The
default value is True.</p>

<p>frameStyle (class frameStyle) If this resource is given
a value of &quot;slab&quot;, the the window manager frame is
drawn such that the client area appears to be at the same
height as the top of the window frame. If the resource is
set to &quot;recessed&quot;, the window frame is drawn such
that the client area appears lower than the top of the
window frame. The default value is &quot;recessed&quot;.</p>

<p>iconAutoPlace (class IconAutoPlace) This resource
indicates whether the window manager arranges icons in a
particular area of the screen or places each icon where the
window was when it was iconified. The value True indicates
that icons are arranged in a particular area of the screen,
determined by the iconPlacement resource. The value False
indicates that an icon is placed at the location of the
window when it is iconified. The default is True.</p>

<p>iconClick (class IconClick) When this resource is given
the value of True, the system menu is posted and left posted
when an icon is clicked. The default value is True.</p>

<p>interactivePlacement (class InteractivePlacement) This
resource controls the initial placement of new windows on
the screen. If the value is True, the pointer shape changes
before a new window is placed on the screen to indi- cate to
the user that a position should be selected for the
upper-left hand corner of the window. If the value is False,
windows are placed according to the initial window
configura- tion attributes. The default value of this
resource is False.</p>

<p>keyboardFocusPolicy (class KeyboardFocusPolicy) If set
to pointer, the keyboard focus policy is to have the
keyboard focus set to the client window that contains the
pointer (the pointer could also be in the client window
deco- ration that mwm adds). If set to explicit, the policy
is to have the keyboard focus set to a client window when
the user presses button 1 with the pointer on the client
window or any part of the associated mwm decoration. The
default value for this resource is explicit.</p>

<p>lowerOnIconify (class LowerOnIconify) If this resource
is given the default value of True, a win- dows icon appears
on the bottom of the window stack when the window is
minimized (iconified). A value of False places the icon in
the stacking order at the same place as its associ- ated
window. The default value of this resource is True.</p>

<p>moveThreshold (class MoveThreshold) This resource is
used to control the sensitivity of dragging operations that
move windows and icons. The value of this resource is the
number of pixels that the locator is moved with a button
down before the move operation is initiated. This is used to
prevent window/icon movement when you click or double-click
and there is unintentional pointer movement with the button
down. The default value of this resource is 4 (pixels).</p>

<p>multiScreen (class MultiScreen) This resource, if True,
causes mwm to manage all the screens on the display. If
False, mwm manages only a single screen. The default value
is False.</p>

<p>passButtons (class PassButtons) This resource indicates
whether or not button press events are passed to clients
after they are used to do a window man- ager function in the
client context. If the resource value is False, the button
press is not passed to the client. If the value is True, the
button press is passed to the client win- dow. The window
manager function is done in either case. The default value
for this resource is False.</p>

<p>passSelectButton (class PassSelectButton) This resource
indicates whether or not to pass the select button press
events to clients after they are used to do a window manager
function in the client context. If the resource value is
False, then the button press will not be passed to the
client. If the value is True, the button press is passed to
the client window. The window manager function is done in
either case. The default value for this resource is
True.</p>

<p>positionIsFrame (class PositionIsFrame) This resource
indicates how client window position informa- tion (from the
WM_NORMAL_HINTS property and from configura- tion requests)
is to be interpreted. If the resource value is True, the
information is interpreted as the position of the mwm client
window frame. If the value is False, it is inter- preted as
being the position of the client area of the win- dow. The
default value of this resource is True.</p>

<p>positionOnScreen (class PositionOnScreen) This resource
is used to indicate that windows should ini- tially be
placed (if possible) so that they are not clipped by the
edge of the screen (if the resource value is True). If a
window is larger than the size of the screen, at least the
upper-left corner of the window is on-screen. If the
resource value is False, windows are placed in the requested
position even if totally off-screen. The default value of
this resource is True.</p>

<p>quitTimeout (class QuitTimeout) This resource specifies
the amount of time (in milliseconds) that mwm will wait for
a client to update the WM_COMMAND property after mwm has
sent the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF message. The default value of this
resource is 1000 (ms). (Refer to the f.kill function
description for additional information.)</p>

<p>raiseKeyFocus (class RaiseKeyFocus) This resource is
available only when the keyboard input focus policy is
explicit. When set to True, this resource specifies that a
window raised by means of the f.normalize_and_raise function
also receives the input focus. The default value of this
resource is False.</p>

<p>refreshByClearing (class RefreshByClearing) This
resource determines the mechanism used to refresh a win- dow
(or the screen) when the f.refresh_win (f.refresh) func-
tion is executed. When set to True, an XClearArea is per-
formed over the window for f.refresh_win. When set to False,
a covering window is created and destroyed over the top of
the window to be refreshed. If the function is f.refresh and
this resource is set to True, then an XClearArea is
performed over every window on the screen. If the resource
is set to False, then one large window covering the entire
screen is created and destroyed. The default value of this
resource is True.</p>

<p>rootButtonClick (class RootButtonClick) The
rootButtonClick resource controls whether the a click on the
root window will post the root menu in a &quot;sticky&quot;
mode. If this resource is set to True, a button click on the
root window will post the menu bound to the button down
event for that button in a &quot;sticky&quot; fashion. If
this resource is set to False, then the same button click
would only cause the menu to flash as it would be unposted
once the button up event is seen. The criterion used to
determine if it is a button click is if the pointer doesnt
move between the but- ton down and button up events. The
default value for this resource is True.</p>

<p>screens (class Screens) This resource specifies the
resource names to use for the screens managed by mwm. If mwm
is managing a single screen, only the first name in the list
is used. If mwm is managing multiple screens, the names are
assigned to the screens in order, starting with screen 0.
Screen 0 gets the first name, screen 1 the second name, and
so on. The default screen names are 0, 1, and so on.</p>

<p>sessionClientDB (class SessionClientDB) This resource
identifies a file name to use as a root when saving state at
the request of an XSMP session manager. When the session is
saved, the window manager will then reuse the file name by
automatically incrementing a suffix.</p>

<p>showFeedback (class ShowFeedback) This resource controls
whether or not feedback windows or confirmation dialogs are
displayed. A feedback window shows a client window s initial
placement and shows position and size during move and resize
operations. Confirmation dialogs can be displayed for
certain operations. The value for this resource is a list of
names of the feedback options to be enabled or disabled; the
names must be separated by a space. If an option is preceded
by a minus sign, that option is excluded from the list. The
sign of the first item in the list determines the initial
set of options. If the sign of the first option is minus,
mwm assumes all options are present and starts subtracting
from that set. If the sign of the first decoration is plus
(or not specified), mwm starts with no options and builds up
a list from the resource.</p>

<p>The names of the feedback options are shown below:</p>

<p>Name Description all Show all feedback (Default value).
behavior Confirm behavior switch. kill Confirm on receipt of
KILL signal. move Show position during move. none Show no
feedback. placement Show position and size during initial
place- ment. quit Confirm quitting mwm. resize Show size
during resize. restart Confirm mwm restart.</p>

<p>The following command line illustrates the syntax for
showFeedback:</p>

<p>Mwm*showFeedback: placement resize behavior restart</p>

<p>This resource specification provides feedback for
initial client place- ment and resize, and enables the
dialog boxes to confirm the restart and set behavior
functions. It disables feedback for the move function. The
default value for this resource is all.</p>

<p>startupKeyFocus (class StartupKeyFocus) This resource is
available only when the keyboard input focus policy is
explicit. When given the default value of True, a window
gets the keyboard input focus when the window is mapped
(that is, initially managed by the window manager). It is
recommended that both autoKeyFocus and startupKeyFocus be
True to work with tear off menus. The default value is
True.</p>

<p>wMenuButtonClick (class WMenuButtonClick) This resource
indicates whether a click of the mouse when the pointer is
over the window menu button posts and leaves posted the
window menu. If the value given this resource is True, the
menu remains posted. True is the default value for this
resource.</p>

<p>wMenuButtonClick2 (class WMenuButtonClick2) When this
resource is given the default value of True, a dou-
ble-click action on the window menu button does an f.kill
function.</p>

<p>Screen Specific Appearance and Behavior Resources The
syntax for specifying screen specific resources is Mwm*
screen_name*resource_id For example, Mwm*1*keyBindings
specifies the key bindings to use for screen
&quot;1&quot;.</p>

<p>buttonBindings (class ButtonBindings) This resource
identifies the set of button bindings for win- dow
management functions. The named set of button bindings is
specified in the mwm resource description file. These button
bindings are merged with the built-in default bindings. The
default value for this resource is
&quot;DefaultButtonBindings&quot;.</p>

<p>cleanText (class CleanText) This resource controls the
display of window manager text in the client title and
feedback windows. If the default value of True is used, the
text is drawn with a clear (no stipple) background. This
makes text easier to read on monochrome sys- tems where a
backgroundPixmap is specified. Only the stip- pling in the
area immediately around the text is cleared. If False, the
text is drawn directly on top of the existing
background.</p>

<p>fadeNormalIcon (class FadeNormalIcon) If this resource
is given a value of True, an icon is grayed out whenever it
has been normalized (its window has been opened). The
default value is False.</p>

<p>feedbackGeometry (class FeedbackGeometry) This resource
sets the position of the move and resize feed- back window.
If this resource is not specified, the default is to place
the feedback window at the center of the screen. The value
of the resource is a standard window geometry string with
the following syntax: [=]{ +-}xoffset{+-} yoff- set]</p>

<p>frameBorderWidth (class FrameBorderWidth) This resource
specifies the width (in pixels) of a client window frame
border without resize handles. The border width includes the
3-D shadows. The default value is based on the size and
resolution of the screen.</p>

<p>iconBoxGeometry (class IconBoxGeometry) This resource
indicates the initial position and size of the icon box. The
value of the resource is a standard window geometry string
with the following syntax: [=][width xheight][{+-}xoffset
{+-}yoffset] If the offsets are not pro- vided, the
iconPlacement policy is used to determine the ini- tial
placement. The units for width and height are columns and
rows. The actual screen size of the icon box window depends
on the iconImageMaximum (size) and iconDecoration resources.
The default value for size is (6 * iconWidth + padding) wide
by (1 * iconHeight + padding) high. The default value of the
location is +0 -0.</p>

<p>iconBoxName (class IconBoxName) This resource specifies
the name that is used to look up icon box resources. The
default name is iconbox.</p>

<p>iconBoxSBDisplayPolicy (class IconBoxSBDisplayPolicy)
This resource specifies the scroll bar display policy of the
window manager in the icon box. The resource has three
possi- ble values: all, vertical, and horizontal. The
default value, &quot;all&quot;, causes both vertical and
horizontal scroll bars always to appear. The value
&quot;vertical&quot; causes a single vertical scroll bar to
appear in the icon box and sets the orientation of the icon
box to horizontal (regardless of the iconBoxGeom- etry
specification). The value &quot;horizontal&quot; causes a
single horizontal scroll bar to appear in the icon box and
sets the orientation of the icon box to vertical (regardless
of the iconBoxGeometry specification).</p>

<p>iconBoxTitle (class IconBoxTitle) This resource
specifies the name that is used in the title area of the
icon box frame. The default value is Icons.</p>

<p>iconDecoration (class IconDecoration) This resource
specifies the general icon decoration. The resource value is
label (only the label part is displayed) or image (only the
image part is displayed) or label image (both the label and
image parts are displayed). A value of active- label can
also be specified to get a label (not truncated to the width
of the icon) when the icon is selected. The default icon
decoration for icon box icons is that each icon has a label
part and an image part (label image). The default icon
decoration for stand alone icons is that each icon has an
active label part, a label part, and an image part
(activela- bel label image).</p>

<p>iconImageMaximum (class IconImageMaximum) This resource
specifies the maximum size of the icon image. The resource
value is widthx height (for example, 64x64). The maximum
supported size is 128x128. The default value of this
resource is 50x50.</p>

<p>iconImageMinimum (class IconImageMinimum) This resource
specifies the minimum size of the icon image. The resource
value is widthx height (for example, 32x50). The minimum
supported size is 16x16. The default value of this resource
is 16x16.</p>

<p>iconPlacement (class IconPlacement) This resource
specifies the icon placement scheme to be used. The resource
value has the following syntax:</p>

<p>primary_layout secondary_layout [tight]</p>

<p>The layout values are one of the following:</p>

<p>Value Description top Lay the icons out top to bottom.
bottom Lay the icons out bottom to top. left Lay the icons
out left to right. right Lay the icons out right to
left.</p>

<p>A horizontal (vertical) layout value should not be used
for both the primary_layout and the secondary_layout (for
example, dont use top for the primary_layout and bottom for
the secondary_layout).</p>

<p>The primary_layout indicates whether, when an icon
placement is done, the icon is placed in a row or a column
and the direction of placement. The secondary_layout
indicates where to place new rows or columns. For example,
top right indicates that icons should be placed top to
bottom on the screen and that columns should be added from
right to left on the screen.</p>

<p>The default placement is left bottom (icons are placed
left to right on the screen, with the first row on the
bottom of the screen, and new rows added from the bottom of
the screen to the top of the screen). A tight value places
icons with zero spacing in between icons. This value is
useful for aesthetic reasons, as well as X-terminals with
small screens.</p>

<p>iconPlacementMargin (class IconPlacementMargin) This
resource sets the distance between the edge of the screen
and the icons that are placed along the edge of the screen.
The value should be greater than or equal to 0. A default
value (see below) is used if the value specified is invalid.
The default value for this resource is equal to the space
between icons as they are placed on the screen (this space
is based on maximizing the number of icons in each row and
column).</p>

<p>keyBindings (class KeyBindings) This resource identifies
the set of key bindings for window management functions. If
specified, these key bindings replace the built-in default
bindings. The named set of key bindings is specified in mwm
resource description file. The default value for this
resource is &quot;DefaultKeyBindings&quot;.</p>

<p>limitResize (class LimitResize) If this resource is
True, the user is not allowed to resize a window to greater
than the maximum size. The default value for this resource
is True.</p>

<p>maximumMaximumSize (class MaximumMaximumSize) This
resource is used to limit the maximum size of a client
window as set by the user or client. The resource value is
widthxheight (for example, 1024x1024) where the width and
height are in pixels. The default value of this resource is
twice the screen width and height.</p>

<p>moveOpaque (class MoveOpaque) This resource controls
whether the actual window is moved or a rectangular outline
of the window is moved. A default value of False displays a
rectangular outline on moves.</p>

<p>resizeBorderWidth (class ResizeBorderWidth) This
resource specifies the width (in pixels) of a client window
frame border with resize handles. The specified border width
includes the 3-D shadows. The default value is based on the
size and resolution of the screen.</p>

<p>resizeCursors (class ResizeCursors) This is used to
indicate whether the resize cursors are always displayed
when the pointer is in the window size bor- der. If True,
the cursors are shown, otherwise the window manager cursor
is shown. The default value is True.</p>

<p>transientDecoration (class TransientDecoration) This
controls the amount of decoration that mwm puts on tran-
sient windows. The decoration specification is exactly the
same as for the clientDecoration (client specific) resource.
Transient windows are identified by the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
property, which is added by the client to indicate a rela-
tively temporary window. The default value for this resource
is menu title (that is, transient windows have frame borders
and a titlebar with a window menu button).</p>

<p>An application can also specify which decorations mwm
should apply to its windows. If it does so, mwm applies only
those decorations indicated by both the application and the
tran- sientDecoration resource. Otherwise, mwm applies the
decora- tions indicated by the transientDecoration resource.
For more information see the description of
XmNmwmDecorations on the VendorShell(3) reference page.</p>

<p>transientFunctions (class TransientFunctions) This
resource is used to indicate which window management
functions are applicable (or not applicable) to transient
windows. The function specification is exactly the same as
for the clientFunctions (client specific) resource. The
default value for this resource is -minimize -maximize.</p>

<p>An application can also specify which functions mwm
should apply to its windows. If it does so, mwm applies only
those functions indicated by both the application and the
tran- sientFunctions resource. Otherwise, mwm applies the
functions indicated by the transientFunctions resource. For
more infor- mation see the description of XmNmwmFunctions on
the Vendor- Shell(3) reference page.</p>

<p>useIconBox (class UseIconBox) If this resource is given
a value of True, icons are placed in an icon box. When an
icon box is not used, the icons are placed on the root
window (default value).</p>

<p>Client Specific Resources The syntax for specifying
client specific resources is</p>

<p>Mwm*client_name_or_class *resource_id</p>

<p>For example, Mwm*mterm*windowMenu is used to specify the
window menu to be used with mterm clients. The syntax for
specifying client specific resources for all classes of
clients is</p>

<p>Mwm*resource_id</p>

<p>Specific client specifications take precedence over the
specifications for all clients. For example, Mwm*windowMenu
is used to specify the window menu to be used for all
classes of clients that dont have a window menu
specified.</p>

<p>The syntax for specifying resource values for windows
that have an unknown name and class (that is, windows that
do not have a WM_CLASS property associated with them) is</p>

<p>Mwm*defaults*resource_id</p>

<p>For example, Mwm*defaults*iconImage is used to specify
the icon image to be used for windows that have an unknown
name and class.</p>

<p>The following client specific resources can be
specified:</p>

<p>Client Specific Resources Name Class Value Type Default
clientDecoration ClientDecoration string all.
clientFunctions ClientFunctions string all. focusAutoRaise

<p>clientDecoration (class ClientDecoration) This resource
controls the amount of window frame decoration. The resource
is specified as a list of decorations to specify their
inclusion in the frame. If a decoration is preceded by a
minus sign, that decoration is excluded from the frame. The
sign of the first item in the list determines the initial
amount of decoration. If the sign of the first decoration is
minus, mwm assumes all decorations are present and starts
subtracting from that set. If the sign of the first decora-
tion is plus (or not specified), then mwm starts with no
dec- oration and builds up a list from the resource.</p>

<p>An application can also specify which decorations mwm
should apply to its windows. If it does so, mwm applies only
those decorations indicated by both the application and the
client- Decoration resource. Otherwise, mwm applies the
decorations indicated by the clientDecoration resource. For
more infor- mation see the description of XmNmwmDecorations
on the Ven- dorShell(3) reference page.</p>

<p>Name Description all Include all decorations (default
value). border Window border. maximize Maximize button
(includes title bar). minimize Minimize button (includes
title bar). none No decorations. resizeh Border resize
handles (includes border). menu Window menu button (includes
title bar). title Title bar (includes border).</p>

<p>Examples: Mwm*XClock.clientDecoration: -resizeh
-maximize This removes the resize handles and maximize
button from XClock windows. Mwm*XClock.clientDecoration:
menu minimize border This does the same thing as above. Note
that either menu or minimize implies title.</p>

<p>clientFunctions (class ClientFunctions) This resource is
used to indicate which mwm functions are applicable (or not
applicable) to the client window. The value for the resource
is a list of functions. If the first function in the list
has a minus sign in front of it, then mwm starts with all
functions and subtracts from that set. If the first function
in the list has a plus sign in front of it, then mwm starts
with no functions and builds up a list. Each function in the
list must be preceded by the appropriate plus or minus sign
and separated from the next function by a space.</p>

<p>An application can also specify which functions mwm
should apply to its windows. If it does so, mwm applies only
those functions indicated by both the application and the
client- Functions resource. Otherwise, mwm applies the
functions indicated by the clientFunctions resource. For
more informa- tion see the description of XmNmwmFunctions on
the Vendor- Shell(3) reference page.</p>

<p>The following table lists the functions available for
this resource:</p>

<p>Name Description all Include all functions (default
value). none No functions. resize f.resize. move f.move.
minimize f.minimize. maximize f.maximize. close f.kill.</p>

<p>See mwmrc(4).</p>

<p>focusAutoRaise (class FocusAutoRaise) When the value of
this resource is True, clients are raised when they get the
keyboard input focus. If the value is False, the stacking of
windows on the display is not changed when a window gets the
keyboard input focus. The default value is True when the
keyboardFocusPolicy is explicit and False when the
keyboardFocusPolicy is pointer.</p>

<p>iconImage (class IconImage) This resource can be used to
specify an icon image for a client (for example,
&quot;Mwm*myclock*iconImage&quot;). The resource value is a
pathname for a pixmap or bitmap file. The value of the
(client specific) useClientIcon resource is used to
determine whether or not user supplied icon images are used
instead of client supplied icon images. The default value is
to display a built-in window manager icon image.</p>

<p>iconImageBackground (class Background) This resource
specifies the background color of the icon image that is
displayed in the image part of an icon. The default value of
this resource is the icon background color (that is,
specified by &quot;Mwm*background or Mwm*icon*back-
ground).</p>

<p>iconImageBottomShadowColor (class Foreground) This
resource specifies the bottom shadow color of the icon image
that is displayed in the image part of an icon. The default
value of this resource is the icon bottom shadow color (that
is, specified by Mwm*icon*bottomShadowColor).</p>

<p>iconImageBottomShadowPixmap (class BottomShadowPixmap)
This resource specifies the bottom shadow Pixmap of the icon
image that is displayed in the image part of an icon. The
default value of this resource is the icon bottom shadow
Pixmap (that is, specified by
Mwm*icon*bottomShadowPixmap).</p>

<p>iconImageForeground (class Foreground) This resource
specifies the foreground color of the icon image that is
displayed in the image part of an icon. The default value of
this resource varies depending on the icon background.</p>

<p>iconImageTopShadowColor (class Background) This resource
specifies the top shadow color of the icon image that is
displayed in the image part of an icon. The default value of
this resource is the icon top shadow color (that is,
specified by Mwm*icon*topShadowColor).</p>

<p>iconImageTopShadowPixmap (class TopShadowPixmap) This
resource specifies the top shadow Pixmap of the icon image
that is displayed in the image part of an icon. The default
value of this resource is the icon top shadow pixmap (that
is, specified by Mwm*icon*topShadowPixmap).</p>

<p>matteBackground (class Background) This resource
specifies the background color of the matte, when matteWidth
is positive. The default value of this resource is the
client background color (that is, specified by
&quot;Mwm*background or Mwm*client*background).</p>

<p>matteBottomShadowColor (class Foreground) This resource
specifies the bottom shadow color of the matte, when
matteWidth is positive. The default value of this resource
is the client bottom shadow color (that is, speci- fied by
Mwm*bottomShadowColor or Mwm*client*bottomShadow-
Color).</p>

<p>matteBottomShadowPixmap (class BottomShadowPixmap) This
resource specifies the bottom shadow Pixmap of the matte,
when matteWidth is positive. The default value of this
resource is the client bottom shadow pixmap (that is, speci-
fied by Mwm*bottomShadowPixmap or Mwm*client*bottomShadow-
Pixmap).</p>

<p>matteForeground (class Foreground) This resource
specifies the foreground color of the matte, when matteWidth
is positive. The default value of this resource is the
client foreground color (that is, specified by
Mwm*foreground or Mwm*client*foreground).</p>

<p>matteTopShadowColor (class Background) This resource
specifies the top shadow color of the matte, when matteWidth
is positive. The default value of this resource is the
client top shadow color (that is, specified by
Mwm*topShadowColor or Mwm*client*topShadowColor).</p>

<p>matteTopShadowPixmap (class TopShadowPixmap) This
resource specifies the top shadow pixmap of the matte, when
matteWidth is positive. The default value of this resource
is the client top shadow pixmap (that is, specified by
&quot;Mwm*topShadowPixmap or
Mwm*client*topShadowPixmap).</p>

<p>matteWidth (class MatteWidth) This resource specifies
the width of the optional matte. The default value is 0,
which effectively disables the matte.</p>

<p>maximumClientSize (class MaximumClientSize) This
resource is either a size specification or a direction that
indicates how a client window is to be maximized. The
resource value can be specified as a size specification
widthxheight. The width and height are interpreted in the
units that the client uses (for example, for terminal emula-
tors this is generally characters). Alternately,
&quot;vertical&quot; or &quot;horizontal&quot; can be
specified to indicate the direction in which the client
maximizes.</p>

<p>If this resource is not specified, the maximum size from
the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property is used if set. Otherwise the
default value is the size where the client window with
window management borders fills the screen. When the maximum
client size is not determined by the maximumClientSize
resource, the maximumMaximumSize resource value is used as a
constraint on the maximum size.</p>

<p>useClientIcon (class UseClientIcon) If the value given
for this resource is True, a client-sup- plied icon image
takes precedence over a user-supplied icon image. The
default value is True, giving the client-supplied icon image
higher precedence than the user-supplied icon image.</p>

<p>usePPosition (class UsePPosition) This resource
specifies whether Mwm honors program specified position
PPosition specified in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property in the
absence of an user specified position. Setting this resource
to on, causes mwm to always honor program specified
position. Setting this resource to off, causes mwm to always
ignore program specified position. Setting this resource to
the default value of nonzero cause mwm to honor program
spec- ified position other than (0,0).</p>

<p>windowMenu (class WindowMenu) This resource indicates
the name of the menu pane that is posted when the window
menu is popped up (usually by pressing button 1 on the
window menu button on the client window frame). Menu panes
are specified in the mwm resource descrip- tion file. Window
menus can be customized on a client class basis by creating
custom menus in your mwmrc file (see mwmrc(4) and specifying
resources to activate the custom menus. The resources have
the form Mwm* client_name_or_class*windowMenu. The default
value of this resource is DefaultWindowMenu.</p>

<p>Resource Description File The mwm resource description
file is a supplementary resource file that contains resource
descriptions that are referred to by entries in the resource
manager property (see xrdb(1) and the defaults files (.Xde-
faults, app-defaults/Mwm ). It contains descriptions of
resources that are to be used by mwm, and that cannot be
easily encoded in the defaults files (a bitmap file is an
analogous type of resource descrip- tion file). A particular
mwm resource description file can be selected using the
configFile resource.</p>

<p>The following types of resources can be described in the
mwm resource description file:</p>

<p>Buttons Window manager functions can be bound
(associated) with but- ton events.</p>

<p>Keys Window manager functions can be bound (associated)
with key press events.</p>

<p>Menus Menu panes can be used for the window menu and
other menus posted with key bindings and button
bindings.</p>

<p>The mwm resource description file is described in
mwmrc(4).</p>

<p>Environment The mwm window manager uses the environment
variable HOME specifying the users home directory.</p>

<p>The mwm window manager uses the environment variable
LANG specifying the users choice of language for the mwm
message catalog and the mwm resource description file.</p>

<p>The mwm window uses the environment variable
XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSER- FILESEARCHPATH, XAPPLRESDIR,
XENVIRONMENT, LANG, and HOME in determin- ing search paths
for resource defaults files. The mwm window manager may also
us XBMLANGPATH to search for bitmap files.</p>

<p>The mwm window manager reads the $HOME/.motifbind file
if it exists to install a virtual key bindings property on
the root window. For more information on the content of the
.motifbind file, see</p>

<p>The mwm window manager uses the environment variable
MWMSHELL (or SHELL, if MWMSHELL is not set), specifying the
shell to use when exe- cuting commands via the f.exec
function.</p>
