<p>NAME wpa_cli - WPA command line client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wpa_cli [ -p path to ctrl sockets ] [ -i ifname
] [ -hvB ] [ -a action file ] [ -P pid file ] [ command ...
]</p>

<p>OVERVIEW wpa_cli is a text-based frontend program for
interacting with wpa_sup- plicant. It is used to query
current status, change configuration, trigger events, and
request interactive user input.</p>

<p>wpa_cli can show the current authentication status,
selected security mode, dot11 and dot1x MIBs, etc. In
addition, it can configure some variables like EAPOL state
machine parameters and trigger events like reassociation and
IEEE 802.1X logoff/logon. wpa_cli provides a user interface
to request authentication information, like username and
password, if these are not included in the configuration.
This can be used to implement, e.g., one-time-passwords or
generic token card authentication where the authentication
is based on a challenge- response that uses an external
device for generating the response.</p>

<p>The control interface of wpa_supplicant can be
configured to allow non- root user access (ctrl_interface
GROUP= parameter in the configuration file). This makes it
possible to run wpa_cli with a normal user account.</p>

<p>wpa_cli supports two modes: interactive and command
line. Both modes share the same command set and the main
difference is in interactive mode providing access to
unsolicited messages (event messages, user- name/password
requests).</p>

<p>Interactive mode is started when wpa_cli is executed
without including the command as a command line parameter.
Commands are then entered on the wpa_cli prompt. In command
line mode, the same commands are entered as command line
arguments for wpa_cli.</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE AUTHENTICATION PARAMETERS REQUEST When
wpa_supplicant need authentication parameters, like username
and password, which are not present in the configuration
file, it sends a request message to all attached frontend
programs, e.g., wpa_cli in interactive mode. wpa_cli shows
these requests with &quot;CTRL-
REQ-&lt;type&gt;-&lt;id&gt;:&lt;text&gt;&quot; prefix.
&lt;type&gt; is IDENTITY, PASSWORD, or OTP
(one-time-password). &lt;id&gt; is a unique identifier for
the current net- work. &lt;text&gt; is description of the
request. In case of OTP request, it includes the challenge
from the authentication server.</p>

<p>The reply to these requests can be given with identity,
password, and otp commands. &lt;id&gt; needs to be copied
from the matching request. pass- word and otp commands can
be used regardless of whether the request was for PASSWORD
or OTP. The main difference between these two commands is
that values given with password are remembered as long as
wpa_suppli- cant is running whereas values given with otp
are used only once and then forgotten, i.e., wpa_supplicant
will ask frontend for a new value for every use. This can be
used to implement one-time-password lists and generic token
card -based authentication.</p>

<p>Example request for password and a matching reply:</p>

<p>CTRL-REQ-PASSWORD-1:Password needed for SSID foobar &gt;
password 1 mysecretpassword</p>

<p>Example request for generic token card
challenge-response:</p>

<p>CTRL-REQ-OTP-2:Challenge 1235663 needed for SSID foobar
&gt; otp 2 9876</p>

<p>COMMAND ARGUMENTS -p path Change the path where control
sockets should be found.</p>

<p>-i ifname Specify the interface that is being
configured. By default, choose the first interface found
with a control socket in the socket path.</p>

<p>-h Help. Show a usage message.</p>

<p>-v Show version information.</p>

<p>-B Run as a daemon in the background.</p>

<p>-a file Run in daemon mode executing the action file
based on events from wpa_supplicant. The specified file will
be executed with the first argument set to interface name
and second to &quot;CON- NECTED&quot; or
&quot;DISCONNECTED&quot; depending on the event. This can be
used to execute networking tools required to configure the
interface.</p>

<p>Additionally, three environmental variables are
available to the file: WPA_CTRL_DIR, WPA_ID, and WPA_ID_STR.
WPA_CTRL_DIR con- tains the absolute path to the
ctrl_interface socket. WPA_ID contains the unique network_id
identifier assigned to the active network, and WPA_ID_STR
contains the content of the id_str option.</p>

<p>-P file Set the location of the PID file.</p>

<p>command Run a command. The available commands are listed
in the next section.</p>

<p>COMMANDS The following commands are available:</p>

<p>status get current WPA/EAPOL/EAP status</p>

<p>mib get MIB variables (dot1x, dot11)</p>

<p>help show this usage help</p>

<p>interface [ifname] show interfaces/select interface</p>

<p>level &lt;debug level&gt; change debug level</p>

<p>license show full wpa_cli license</p>

<p>logoff IEEE 802.1X EAPOL state machine logoff</p>

<p>logon IEEE 802.1X EAPOL state machine logon</p>

<p>set set variables (shows list of variables when run
without argu- ments)</p>

<p>pmksa show PMKSA cache</p>

<p>reassociate force reassociation</p>

<p>reconfigure force wpa_supplicant to re-read its
configuration file</p>

<p>preauthenticate &lt;BSSID&gt; force
preauthentication</p>

<p>identity &lt;network id&gt; &lt;identity&gt; configure
identity for an SSID</p>

<p>password &lt;network id&gt; &lt;password&gt; configure
password for an SSID</p>

<p>pin &lt;network id&gt; &lt;pin&gt; configure pin for an
SSID</p>

<p>otp &lt;network id&gt; &lt;password&gt; configure
one-time-password for an SSID</p>

<p>bssid &lt;network id&gt; &lt;BSSID&gt; set preferred
BSSID for an SSID</p>

<p>list_networks list configured networks</p>

<p>terminate terminate wpa_supplicant</p>

<p>quit exit wpa_cli</p>
