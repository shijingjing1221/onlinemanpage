<p>XISETFOCUS(3) XISETFOCUS(3)</p>

<p>NAME XISetFocus, XIGetFocus - set or get the
device&rsquo;s focus.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput2.h&gt;</p>

<p>Status XISetFocus( Display *display, int deviceid,
Window focus, Time time);</p>

<p>Status XIGetFocus( Display *display, Window
*focus_return);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>deviceid Specifies the device whose focus is to be
queried or changed.</p>

<p>focus The new focus window.</p>

<p>focus_return Returns the current focus window.</p>

<p>time A valid timestamp or CurrentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XISetFocus changes the focus of the
specified device ans its last-focus-change time. It has no
effect if the specified time is earlier than the current
last-focus-change time or is later than the current X server
time. Otherwise, the last-focus-change time is set to the
specified time. CurrentTime is replaced by the current X
server time). XISetFocus causes the X server to generate
core, XI and XI2 focus events.</p>

<p>If the focus window is None all keyboard events by this
device are discarded until a new focus window is set.
Otherwise, if focus is a window, it becomes the
device&rsquo;s focus window. If a generated device event
would normally be reported to this window or one of its
inferiors, the event is reported as usual. Otherwise, the
event is reported relative to the focus window.</p>

<p>The specified focus window must be viewable at the time
XISetFocus is called, or a BadMatch error results. If the
focus window later becomes not viewable, the focus reverts
to the parent (or the closest viewable ancestor. When the
focus reverts, the X server generates core, XI and XI2 focus
events but the last-focus-change time is not affected.</p>

<p>Attempting to set the focus on a master pointer device
or an attached slave device will result in a BadDevice
error.</p>

<p>XISetFocus can generate BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue,
and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue A value is outside of the permitted
range.</p>

<p>BadDevice An invalid device was specified. The device
does not exist or is not a appropriate for the type of
change.</p>

<p>BadMatch The window is not viewable.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
