<p>QRLS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QRLS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qrls - release batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qrls [-h hold_list] job_identifier ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A batch job might have one or more holds,
which prevent the batch job from executing. A batch job from
which all the holds have been removed becomes eligible for
execution and is said to have been released. A batch job
hold is removed by sending a request to the batch server
that manages the batch job. The qrls utility is a
user-accessible client of batch services that requests holds
be removed from one or more batch jobs.</p>

<p>The qrls utility shall remove one or more holds from
those batch jobs for which a batch job_identifier is
presented to the utility.</p>

<p>The qrls utility shall remove holds from batch jobs in
the order in which their batch job_identifiers are presented
to the utility.</p>

<p>If the qrls utility fails to process a batch
job_identifier success- fully, the utility shall proceed to
process the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p>The qrls utility shall remove holds on each batch job by
sending a Release Job Request to the batch server that
manages the batch job.</p>

<p>The qrls utility shall not exit until the holds have
been removed from the batch job corresponding to each
successfully processed batch job_identifier.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The qrls utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-h hold_list Define the types of holds to be removed
from the batch job.</p>

<p>The qrls -h option shall accept a value for the
hold_list option-argu- ment that is a string of alphanumeric
characters in the portable char- acter set (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set).</p>

<p>The qrls utility shall accept a value for the hold_list
option-argument that is a string of one or more of the
characters,, or, or the single charactern.</p>

<p>For each unique character in the hold_list
option-argument, the qrls utility shall add a value to the
Hold_Types attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different hold type:</p>

<p>u USER</p>

<p>s SYSTEM</p>

<p>o OPERATOR</p>

<p>If any of these characters are duplicated in the
hold_list option-argu- ment, the duplicates shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>An existing Hold_Types attribute can be cleared by the
following hold type:</p>

<p>n NO_HOLD</p>

<p>The qrls utility shall consider it an error if any hold
type other than nis combined with hold typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters , , , ornwithin the hold_list
option-argument. The qrls utility shall permit the
repetition of characters, but shall not assign additional
meaning to the repeated characters.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other hold types. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe
any additional hold types, how they are specified, their
internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the
utility.</p>

<p>If the -h option is not presented to the qrls utility,
the implementa- tion shall remove the USER hold in the
Hold_Types attribute.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qrls utility shall accept one or more
operands that conform to the syntax for a batch
job_identifier (see Batch Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qrls:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT None.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qrls utility shall not be required to write a
diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qrls utility waits to output the diagnostic message
while attempting to locate the job on other servers is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qrls utility allows users, operators, and
administrators to remove holds from jobs.</p>

<p>The qrls utility does not support any job selection
options or wildcard arguments. Users may acquire a list of
jobs selected by attributes using the qselect utility. For
example, a user could select all of their held jobs.</p>

<p>The -h option allows the user to specify the type of
hold that is to be removed. This option allows for USER,
SYSTEM, OPERATOR, and implementa- tion-defined hold types.
The batch server that manages the batch job will verify
whether the user is authorized to remove the specified hold
for the batch job. If more than one type of hold has been
placed on the batch job, a user may wish to remove only some
of them.</p>

<p>Mail is not required on release because the
administrator has the tools and libraries to build this
option if required.</p>

<p>The qrls utility is a new utility vis-a-vis existing
practice; it has been defined in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 as the natural com- plement to the qhold
utility.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
