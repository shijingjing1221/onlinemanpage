<p>NAME msgrcv, msgsnd - message operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int msgsnd(int msqid, const void *msgp, size_t msgsz,
int msgflg);</p>

<p>ssize_t msgrcv(int msqid, void *msgp, size_t msgsz, long
msgtyp, int msgflg);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The msgsnd() and msgrcv() system calls are
used, respectively, to send messages to, and receive
messages from, a message queue. The calling process must
have write permission on the message queue in order to send
a message, and read permission to receive a message.</p>

<p>The msgp argument is a pointer to caller-defined
structure of the fol- lowing general form:</p>

<p>struct msgbuf { long mtype; /* message type, must be
&gt; 0 */ char mtext[1]; /* message data */ };</p>

<p>The mtext field is an array (or other structure) whose
size is speci- fied by msgsz, a non-negative integer value.
Messages of zero length (i.e., no mtext field) are
permitted. The mtype field must have a strictly positive
integer value. This value can be used by the receiv- ing
process for message selection (see the description of
msgrcv() below).</p>

<p>msgsnd() The msgsnd() system call appends a copy of the
message pointed to by msgp to the message queue whose
identifier is specified by msqid.</p>

<p>If sufficient space is available in the queue, msgsnd()
succeeds imme- diately. (The queue capacity is defined by
the msg_bytes field in the associated data structure for the
message queue. During queue creation this field is
initialized to MSGMNB bytes, but this limit can be modi-
fied using msgctl(2).) If insufficient space is available in
the queue, then the default behavior of msgsnd() is to block
until space becomes available. If IPC_NOWAIT is specified in
msgflg, then the call instead fails with the error
EAGAIN.</p>

<p>A blocked msgsnd() call may also fail if:</p>

<p>* the queue is removed, in which case the system call
fails with errno set to EIDRM; or</p>

<p>* a signal is caught, in which case the system call
fails with errno set to EINTR;see signal(7). (msgsnd() is
never automatically restarted after being interrupted by a
signal handler, regardless of the setting of the SA_RESTART
flag when establishing a signal han- dler.)</p>

<p>Upon successful completion the message queue data
structure is updated as follows:</p>

<p>msg_lspid is set to the process ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>msg_qnum is incremented by 1.</p>

<p>msg_stime is set to the current time.</p>

<p>msgrcv() The msgrcv() system call removes a message from
the queue specified by msqid and places it in the buffer
pointed to by msgp.</p>

<p>The argument msgsz specifies the maximum size in bytes
for the member mtext of the structure pointed to by the msgp
argument. If the message text has length greater than msgsz,
then the behavior depends on whether MSG_NOERROR is
specified in msgflg. If MSG_NOERROR is speci- fied, then the
message text will be truncated (and the truncated part will
be lost); if MSG_NOERROR is not specified, then the message
isnt removed from the queue and the system call fails
returning -1 with errno set to E2BIG.</p>

<p>The argument msgtyp specifies the type of message
requested as follows:</p>

<p>* If msgtyp is 0, then the first message in the queue is
read.</p>

<p>* If msgtyp is greater than 0, then the first message in
the queue of type msgtyp is read, unless MSG_EXCEPT was
specified in msgflg, in which case the first message in the
queue of type not equal to msgtyp will be read.</p>

<p>* If msgtyp is less than 0, then the first message in
the queue with the lowest type less than or equal to the
absolute value of msgtyp will be read.</p>

<p>The msgflg argument is a bit mask constructed by ORing
together zero or more of the following flags:</p>

<p>IPC_NOWAIT Return immediately if no message of the
requested type is in the queue. The system call fails with
errno set to ENOMSG.</p>

<p>MSG_EXCEPT Used with msgtyp greater than 0 to read the
first message in the queue with message type that differs
from msgtyp.</p>

<p>MSG_NOERROR To truncate the message text if longer than
msgsz bytes.</p>

<p>If no message of the requested type is available and
IPC_NOWAIT isnt specified in msgflg, the calling process is
blocked until one of the following conditions occurs:</p>

<p>* A message of the desired type is placed in the
queue.</p>

<p>* The message queue is removed from the system. In this
case the sys- tem call fails with errno set to EIDRM.</p>

<p>* The calling process catches a signal. In this case the
system call fails with errno set to EINTR. (msgrcv() is
never automatically restarted after being interrupted by a
signal handler, regardless of the setting of the SA_RESTART
flag when establishing a signal han- dler.)</p>

<p>Upon successful completion the message queue data
structure is updated as follows:</p>

<p>msg_lrpid is set to the process ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>msg_qnum is decremented by 1.</p>

<p>msg_rtime is set to the current time.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On failure both functions return -1 with
errno indicating the error, otherwise msgsnd() returns 0 and
msgrcv() returns the number of bytes actually copied into
the mtext array.</p>

<p>ERRORS When msgsnd() fails, errno will be set to one
among the following val- ues:</p>

<p>EACCES The calling process does not have write
permission on the mes- sage queue, and does not have the
CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.</p>

<p>EAGAIN The message cant be sent due to the msg_qbytes
limit for the queue and IPC_NOWAIT was specified in
msgflg.</p>

<p>EFAULT The address pointed to by msgp isnt
accessible.</p>

<p>EIDRM The message queue was removed.</p>

<p>EINTR Sleeping on a full message queue condition, the
process caught a signal.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid msqid value, or non-positive mtype value,
or invalid msgsz value (less than 0 or greater than the
system value MSG- MAX).</p>

<p>ENOMEM The system does not have enough memory to make a
copy of the message pointed to by msgp.</p>

<p>When msgrcv() fails, errno will be set to one among the
following val- ues:</p>

<p>E2BIG The message text length is greater than msgsz and
MSG_NOERROR isnt specified in msgflg.</p>

<p>EACCES The calling process does not have read permission
on the message queue, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER
capability.</p>

<p>EAGAIN No message was available in the queue and
IPC_NOWAIT was speci- fied in msgflg.</p>

<p>EFAULT The address pointed to by msgp isnt
accessible.</p>

<p>EIDRM While the process was sleeping to receive a
message, the message queue was removed.</p>

<p>EINTR While the process was sleeping to receive a
message, the process caught a signal; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL msgqid was invalid, or msgsz was less than 0.</p>

<p>ENOMSG IPC_NOWAIT was specified in msgflg and no message
of the requested type existed on the message queue.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The msgp argument is declared as struct msgbuf *
with libc4, libc5, glibc 2.0, glibc 2.1. It is declared as
void * with glibc 2.2 and later, as required by SUSv2 and
SUSv3.</p>

<p>The following limits on message queue resources affect
the msgsnd() call:</p>

<p>MSGMAX Maximum size for a message text: 8192 bytes (on
Linux, this limit can be read and modified via
/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax).</p>

<p>MSGMNB Default maximum size in bytes of a message queue:
16384 bytes (on Linux, this limit can be read and modified
via /proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb). The superuser can increase the
size of a message queue beyond MSGMNB by a msgctl(2) system
call.</p>

<p>The implementation has no intrinsic limits for the
system wide maximum number of message headers (MSGTQL) and
for the system wide maximum size in bytes of the message
pool (MSGPOOL).</p>
