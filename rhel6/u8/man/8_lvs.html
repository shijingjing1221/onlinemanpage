<p>DESCRIPTION lvs produces formatted output about logical
volumes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>--aligned Use with --separator to align the output
columns.</p>

<p>--binary Use binary values &quot;0&quot; or
&quot;1&quot; instead of descriptive literal val- ues for
columns that have exactly two valid values to report (not
counting the &quot;unknown&quot; value which denotes that
the value could not be determined).</p>

<p>--all Include information in the output about internal
Logical Volumes that are components of normally-accessible
Logical Volumes, such as mirrors, but which are not
independently accessible (e.g. not mountable). The names of
such Logical Volumes are enclosed within square brackets in
the output. For example, after creat- ing a mirror using
lvcreate -m1 --mirrorlog disk , this option will reveal
three internal Logical Volumes, with suffixes mim- age_0,
mimage_1, and mlog.</p>

<p>--nameprefixes Add an &quot;LVM2_&quot; prefix plus the
field name to the output. Useful with --noheadings to
produce a list of field=value pairs that can be used to set
environment variables (for example, in udev(7) rules).</p>

<p>--noheadings Suppress the headings line that is normally
the first line of output. Useful if grepping the output.</p>

<p>--nosuffix Suppress the suffix on output sizes. Use with
--units (except h and H) if processing the output.</p>

<p>-o, --options Comma-separated ordered list of
columns.</p>

<p>Precede the list with + to append to the current list of
columns, - to remove from the current list of columns or #
to compact given columns. The -o option can be repeated,
provid- ing several lists. These lists are evaluated from
left to right.</p>

<p>Use -o lv_all to select all logical volume columns, and
-o seg_all to select all logical volume segment columns.</p>

<p>Use -o help to view the full list of columns
available.</p>

<p>Column names include: chunk_size, convert_lv,
copy_percent, data_lv, devices, discards, lv_attr, lv_host,
lv_kernel_major, lv_kernel_minor, lv_kernel_read_ahead,
lv_major, lv_minor, lv_name, lv_path, lv_profile,
lv_read_ahead, lv_size, lv_tags, lv_time, lv_uuid,
metadata_lv, mirror_log, modules, move_pv, origin,
origin_size, pool_lv, raid_max_recovery_rate,
raid_min_recovery_rate, raid_mismatch_count,
raid_sync_action, raid_write_behind, region_size, segtype,
seg_count, seg_pe_ranges, seg_size, seg_size_pe, seg_start,
seg_start_pe, seg_tags, snap_percent, stripes, stripe_size,
sync_percent, thin_count, transaction_id, zero.</p>

<p>With --segments, any &quot;seg_&quot; prefixes are
optional; otherwise any &quot;lv_&quot; prefixes are
optional. Columns mentioned in vgs(8) can also be
chosen.</p>

<p>The lv_attr bits are:</p>

<p>1 Volume type: (C)ache, (m)irrored, (M)irrored without
initial sync, (o)rigin, (O)rigin with merging snapshot,
(r)aid, (R)aid without initial sync, (s)napshot, merging
(S)napshot, (p)vmove, (v)irtual, mirror or raid (i)mage,
mirror or raid (I)mage out-of-sync, mirror (l)og device,
under (c)onversion, thin (V)olume, (t)hin pool, (T)hin pool
data, raid or pool m(e)tadata or pool metadata spare.</p>

<p>2 Permissions: (w)riteable, (r)ead-only, (R)ead-only
activation of non-read-only volume</p>

<p>3 Allocation policy: (a)nywhere, (c)ontiguous,
(i)nherited, c(l)ing, (n)ormal This is capitalised if the
volume is cur- rently locked against allocation changes, for
example during pvmove(8).</p>

<p>4 fixed (m)inor</p>

<p>5 State: (a)ctive, (s)uspended, (I)nvalid snapshot,
invalid (S)uspended snapshot, snapshot (m)erge failed,
suspended snapshot (M)erge failed, mapped (d)evice present
without tables, mapped device present with (i)nactive table,
thin- pool (c)heck needed, suspended thin-pool (C)heck
needed, (X) unknown</p>

<p>6 device (o)pen, (X) unknown</p>

<p>7 Target type: (C)ache, (m)irror, (r)aid, (s)napshot,
(t)hin, (u)nknown, (v)irtual. This groups logical volumes
related to the same kernel target together. So, for example,
mirror images, mirror logs as well as mirrors themselves
appear as (m) if they use the original device-mapper mirror
kernel driver; whereas the raid equivalents using the md
raid kernel driver all appear as (r). Snapshots using the
original device-mapper driver appear as (s); whereas
snapshots of thin volumes using the new thin provisioning
driver appear as (t).</p>

<p>8 Newly-allocated data blocks are overwritten with
blocks of (z)eroes before use.</p>

<p>9 Volume Health, where there are currently three groups
of attributes identified:</p>

<p>Common ones for all Logical Volumes: (p)artial, (X)
unknown. (p)artial signifies that one or more of the
Physical Volumes this Logical Volume uses is missing from
the system. (X) unknown signifies the status is unknown.</p>

<p>Related to RAID Logical Volumes: (r)efresh needed,
(m)ismatches exist, (w)ritemostly. (r)efresh signifies that
one or more of the Physical Volumes this RAID Logical Volume
uses had suffered a write error. The write error could be
due to a temporary failure of that Phys- ical Volume or an
indication that it is failing. The device should be
refreshed or replaced. (m)ismatches signifies that the RAID
logical volume has portions of the array that are not
coherent. Inconsistencies are detected by initiating a
&quot;check&quot; on a RAID logical volume. (The scrubbing
operations, &quot;check&quot; and &quot;repair&quot;, can be
performed on a RAID logical vol- ume via the lvchange
command.) (w)ritemostly signifies the devices in a RAID 1
logical volume that have been marked write-mostly.</p>

<p>Related to Thin pool Logical Volumes: (F)ailed, out of
(D)ata space, (M)etadata read only. (F)ailed is set if thin
pool encounters serious failures and hence no further I/O is
permitted at all. The out of (D)ata space is set if thin
pool has run out of data space. (M)eta- data read only
signifies that thin pool encounters certain types of
failures but its still possible to do reads at least, but no
metadata changes are allowed.</p>

<p>Related to Thin Logical Volumes: (F)ailed. (F)ailed is
set when related thin pool enters Failed state and no
further I/O is permitted at all.</p>

<p>10 s(k)ip activation: this volume is flagged to be
skipped dur- ing activation.</p>

<p>-O, --sort Comma-separated ordered list of columns to
sort by. Replaces the default selection. Precede any column
with - for a reverse sort on that column.</p>

<p>--rows Output columns as rows.</p>

<p>-S, --select Selection Display only rows that match
Selection criteria. All rows are displayed with the
additional &quot;selected&quot; column (-o selected) showing
1 if the row matches the Selection and 0 otherwise. The
Selection criteria are defined by specifying column names
and their valid values (that can include reserved values)
while mak- ing use of supported comparison operators. See
lvm(8) and -S, --select description for more detailed
information about con- structing the Selection criteria. As
a quick help and to see full list of column names that can
be used in Selection includ- ing the list of reserved values
and the set of supported selec- tion operators, check the
output of lvs -S help command.</p>

<p>--segments Use default columns that emphasize segment
information.</p>

<p>--separator Separator String to use to separate each
column. Useful if grepping the output.</p>

<p>--unbuffered Produce output immediately without sorting
or aligning the columns properly.</p>

<p>--units hHbBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE All sizes are output in these
units: (h)uman-readable, (b)ytes, (s)ectors, (k)ilobytes,
(m)egabytes, (g)igabytes, (t)erabytes, (p)etabytes,
(e)xabytes. Capitalise to use multiples of 1000 (S.I.)
instead of 1024. Can also specify custom units e.g. --units
3M</p>

<p>--unquoted When used with --nameprefixes, output values
in the field=value pairs are not quoted.</p>
