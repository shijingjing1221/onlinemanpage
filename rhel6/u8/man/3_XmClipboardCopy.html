<p>NAME XmClipboardCopy A clipboard function that copies a
data item to tem- porary storage for later copying to
clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardCopy (display, window, item_id, format_name,
buffer, length, private_id, data_id) Display * display;
Window window; long item_id; char * format_name; XtPointer
buffer; unsigned long length; long private_id; long *
data_id; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardCopy copies a data item to
temporary storage. The data item is moved from temporary
storage to the clipboard data structure when a call to
XmClipboardEndCopy is made. Additional calls to XmClipboard-
Copy before a call to XmClipboardEndCopy add additional data
item for- mats to the same data item or append data to an
existing format. For- mats are described in the Inter-Client
Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM) as targets.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not call XmClipboardCopy before a call to
XmClipboardStartCopy has been made. The latter function
allocates temporary storage required by XmClipboardCopy.</p>

<p>If the buffer argument is NULL, the data is considered
to be passed by name. When data that has been passed by name
is later requested by another application, the application
that owns the data receives a callback with a request for
the data. The application that owns the data must then
transfer the data to the clipboard with the XmClipboard-
CopyByName function. When a data item that was passed by
name is deleted from the clipboard, the application that
owns the data receives a callback stating that the data is
no longer needed.</p>

<p>For information on the callback function, see the
callback argument description for XmClipboardStartCopy.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>item_id Specifies the number assigned to this data item.
This number was returned by a previous call to
XmClipboardStartCopy.</p>

<p>format_name Specifies the name of the format in which
the data item is stored on the clipboard. The format was
known as target in the ICCCM.</p>

<p>buffer Specifies the buffer from which the clipboard
copies the data.</p>

<p>length Specifies the length, in bytes, of the data being
copied to the clipboard.</p>

<p>private_id Specifies the private data that the
application wants to store with the data item.</p>

<p>data_id Specifies an identifying number assigned to the
data item that uniquely identifies the data item and the
format. This argument is required only for data that is
passed by name.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardFail The function failed because
XmClipboardStartCopy was not called or because the data item
contains too many formats.</p>
