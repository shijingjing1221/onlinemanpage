<p>NAME slapd-ndb - MySQL NDB backend to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ndb backend to slapd(8) uses the MySQL
Cluster package to store data, through its NDB API. It
provides fault tolerance with extreme scalability, along
with a degree of SQL compatibility.</p>

<p>This backend is designed to store LDAP information using
tables that are also visible from SQL. It uses a higher
level SQL API for creating these tables, while using the low
level NDB API for storing and retrieving the data within
these tables. The NDB Cluster engine allows data to be
partitioned across multiple data nodes, and this backend
allows multiple slapd instances to operate against a given
database concurrently.</p>

<p>The general approach is to use distinct tables for each
LDAP object class. Entries comprised of multiple object
classes will have their data spread across multiple tables.
The data tables use a 64 bit entryID as their primary key.
The DIT hierarchy is maintained in a sep- arate table, which
maps DNs to entryIDs.</p>

<p>This backend is experimental. While intended to be a
general-purpose backend, it is currently missing a number of
common LDAP features. See the TODO file in the source
directory for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the ndb
backend database. That is, they must follow a &quot;database
ndb&quot; line and come before any subsequent
&quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot; lines. Other
database options are described in the slapd.conf(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>DATA SOURCE CONFIGURATION dbhost &lt;hostname&gt; The
name or IP address of the host running the MySQL server. The
default is &quot;localhost&quot;. On Unix systems, the
connection to a local server is made using a Unix Domain
socket, whose path is specified using the dbsocket
directive.</p>

<p>dbuser &lt;username&gt; The MySQL login ID to use when
connecting to the MySQL server. The chosen user must have
sufficient privileges to manipulate the SQL tables in the
target database.</p>

<p>dbpasswd &lt;password&gt; The password for the
dbuser.</p>

<p>dbname &lt;database name&gt; The name of the MySQL
database to use.</p>

<p>dbport &lt;port&gt; The port number to use for the TCP
connection to the MySQL server.</p>

<p>dbsocket &lt;path&gt; The socket to be used for
connecting to a local MySQL server.</p>

<p>dbflag &lt;integer&gt; Client flags for the MySQL
session. See the MySQL documentation for details.</p>

<p>dbconnect &lt;connectstring&gt; The name or IP address
of the host running the cluster manager. The default is
&quot;localhost&quot;.</p>

<p>dbconnections &lt;integer&gt; The number of cluster
connections to establish. Using up to 4 may improve
performance under heavier load. The default is 1.</p>

<p>SCHEMA CONFIGURATION attrlen &lt;attribute&gt;
&lt;length&gt; Specify the column length to use for a
particular attribute. LDAP attributes are stored in
individual columns of the SQL tables. The maximum column
lengths for each column must be spec- ified when creating
these tables. If a length constraint was specified in the
attribute s LDAP schema definition, that value will be used
by default. If the schema didnt specify a con- straint, the
default is 128 bytes. Currently the maximum is 1024.</p>

<p>index &lt;attr[,attr...]&gt; Specify a list of
attributes for which indexing should be main- tained.
Currently there is no support for substring indexing; a
single index structure provides presence, equality, and
inequal- ity indexing for the specified attributes.</p>

<p>attrset &lt;set&gt; &lt;attrs&gt; Specify a list of
attributes to be treated as an attribute set. This directive
creates a table named set which will contain all of the
listed attributes. Ordinarily an attribute resides in a
table named by an object class that uses the attribute.
However, attributes are only allowed to appear in a single
table. For attributes that are derived from an inherited
object class defi- nition, the attribute will only be stored
in the superior class s table. Attribute sets should be
defined for any attributes that are used in multiple
unrelated object classes, i.e., classes that are not
connected by a simple inheritance chain.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL The ndb backend honors most access
control semantics as indicated in slapd.access(5).</p>
