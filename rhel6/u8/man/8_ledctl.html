<p>ledctl(8) Intel(R) Enclosure LED Control Application
ledctl(8)</p>

<p>NAME ledctl - Intel(R) LED control application for a
storage enclosures.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ledctl [OPTIONS] pattern_name=list_of_devices
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ledctl is an user space application
designed to control LEDs associated with each slot in an
enclosure or a drive bay. The LEDs of devices listed in
list_of_devices are set to the given pattern pattern_name
and all other LEDs are turned off. User must have root
privileges to use this application.</p>

<p>There are two types of systems: 2-LEDs systems (Activity
LED, Status LED) and 3-LEDs systems (Activity LED, Locate
LED, Fail LED). The ledctl application uses SGPIO and SES-2
protocol to control LEDs. The program implements IBPI
patterns of SFF-8489 specification for SGPIO. Please note
some enclosures do not stick close to SFF-8489
specification. It might happen that enclosures processor
will accept an IBPI pattern but it will blink the LEDs at
variance with SFF-8489 specification or it has limited
number of patterns supported.</p>

<p>LED management (AHCI) and SAF-TE protocols are not
supported.</p>

<p>The ledctl application has been verified to work with
Intel(R) storage controllers (i.e. Intel(R) AHCI controller
and Intel(R) SAS controller). The application might work
with storage controllers of other vendors (especially
SCSI/SAS controllers). However, storage controllers of other
vendors have not been tested.</p>

<p>The ledmon application has the highest priority when
accessing LEDs. It means that some patterns set by ledctl
may have no effect if ledmon is running (except Locate
pattern).</p>

<p>The ledctl application is a part of Intel(R) Enclosure
LED Utilities.</p>

<p>Pattern Names The ledctl application accepts the
following names for pattern_name argument according to
SFF-8489 specification.</p>

<p>locate Turns Locate LED associated with the given
device(s) or empty slot(s) on.</p>

<p>locate_off Turns only Locate LED off.</p>

<p>normal Turns Status LED, Failure LED and Locate LED
off.</p>

<p>off Turns only Status LED and Failure LED off.</p>

<p>ica or degraded Visualizes &quot;In a Critical
Array&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>rebuild or rebuild_p Visualizes &quot;Rebuild&quot;
pattern.</p>

<p>ifa or failed_array Visualizes &quot;In a Failed
Array&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>hotspare Visualizes &quot;Hotspare&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>pfa Visualizes &quot;Predicted Failure Analysis&quot;
pattern.</p>

<p>failure or disk_failed Visualizes &quot;Failure&quot;
pattern.</p>

<p>ses_abort SES-2 R/R ABORD</p>

<p>ses_rebuild SES-2 REBUILD/REMAP</p>

<p>ses_ifa SES-2 IN FAILED ARRAY</p>

<p>ses_ica SES-2 IN CRIT ARRAY</p>

<p>ses_cons_check SES-2 CONS CHECK</p>

<p>ses_hotspare SES-2 HOT SPARE</p>

<p>ses_rsvd_dev SES-2 RSVD DEVICE</p>

<p>ses_ok SES-2 OK</p>

<p>ses_ident SES-2 IDENT</p>

<p>ses_rm SES-2 REMOVE</p>

<p>ses_insert SES-2 INSERT</p>

<p>ses_missing SES-2 MISSING</p>

<p>ses_dnr SES-2 DO NOT REMOVE</p>

<p>ses_active SES-2 ACTIVE</p>

<p>ses_enbale_bb SES-2 ENABLE BYP B</p>

<p>ses_enable_ba SES-2 ENABLE BYP A</p>

<p>ses_devoff SES-2 DEVICE OFF</p>

<p>ses_fault SES-2 FAULT</p>

<p>Patterns Translation When non SES-2 pattern is send to
device in enclosure automatic translation is being done.</p>

<p>locate locate is translated to ses_ident</p>

<p>locate_off locate_off is translated to ~ses_ident</p>

<p>normal normal is translated to ses_ok</p>

<p>off off is translated to ses_ok</p>

<p>degraded degraded is translated to ses_ica</p>

<p>rebuild rebuild is translated to ses_rebuild</p>

<p>rebuild_p rebuild_p is translated to ses_rebuild</p>

<p>failed failed is translated to ses_ifa</p>

<p>hotspare hotspare is translated to ses_hotspare</p>

<p>pfa pfa is translated to ses_rsvd_dev</p>

<p>failure failure is translated to ses_fault</p>

<p>disk_failed disk_failed is translated to ses_fault</p>

<p>List of Devices The application accepts a list of
devices in two formats. The first format is a list with
comma separated elements. The second format is a list in
curly braces and elements are separated by space. See
examples section bellow for details.</p>

<p>A device is a path to file in /dev directory or in
/sys/block directory. It may identify a block device, a RAID
device or a container device. In case of a RAID device or a
container device a state will be set for all block devices
associated, respectively.</p>

<p>The LEDs of devices listed in list_of_devices are set to
the given pattern pattern_name and all other LEDs are turned
off.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c or --config=path Sets a path to local
configuration file. If this option is specified the global
configuration file and user configuration file has no
effect.</p>

<p>-l or --log=path Sets a path to local log file. If this
option is specified the global log file /var/log/ledctl.log
is not used.</p>

<p>-h or --help Prints this text out and exits.</p>

<p>-v or --version Displays version of ledctl and
information about the license and exits.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/ledctl.log Global log file, used by all
instances of ledctl application. To force logging to user
defined file use -l option switch.</p>

<p>~/.ledctl User configuration file, shared between ledmon
and all ledctl application instances.</p>

<p>/etc/ledcfg.conf Global configuration file, shared
between ledmon and all ledctl application instances.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example illustrates how to locate
a single block device.</p>

<p>ledctl locate=/dev/sda</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to turn Locate LED
off for the same block device.</p>

<p>ledctl locate_off=/dev/sda</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to locate disks of
a RAID device and how to set rebuild pattern for two block
devices at the same time. This example uses both formats of
device list.</p>

<p>ledctl locate=/dev/md127 rebuild={ /sys/block/sd[a-b]
}</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to turn Status LED
and Failure LED off for the given device(s).</p>

<p>ledctl off={ /dev/sda /dev/sdb }</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to locate a three
block devices. This example uses the first format of device
list.</p>

<p>ledctl locate=/dev/sda,/dev/sdb,/dev/sdc</p>
