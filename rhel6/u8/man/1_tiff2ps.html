<p>NAME tiff2ps - convert a TIFF image to PostScript</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiff2ps [ options ] input.tif ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tiff2ps reads TIFF images and writes
PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) on the standard
output. By default, tiff2ps writes Encapsulated PostScript
for the first image in the specified TIFF image file.</p>

<p>By default, tiff2ps will generate PostScript that fills
a printed area specified by the TIFF tags in the input file.
If the file does not contain XResolution or YResolution
tags, then the printed area is set according to the image
dimensions. The -w and -h options (see below) can be used to
set the dimensions of the printed area in inches; over-
riding any relevant TIFF tags.</p>

<p>The PostScript generated for RGB, palette, and CMYK
images uses the colorimage operator. The PostScript
generated for greyscale and bilevel images uses the image
operator. When the colorimage operator is used, PostScript
code to emulate this operator on older PostScript printers
is also generated. Note that this emulation code can be very
slow.</p>

<p>Color images with associated alpha data are composited
over a white background.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -1 Generate PostScript Level 1 (the
default).</p>

<p>-2 Generate PostScript Level 2.</p>

<p>-3 Generate PostScript Level 3. It basically allows one
to use the /flateDecode filter for ZIP compressed TIFF
images.</p>

<p>-a Generate output for all IFDs (pages) in the input
file.</p>

<p>-b Specify the bottom margin for the output (in inches).
This does not affect the height of the printed image.</p>

<p>-c Center the image in the output. This option only
shows an effect if both the -w and the -h option are
given.</p>

<p>-d Set the initial TIFF directory to the specified
directory num- ber. (NB: Directories are numbered starting
at zero.) This option is useful for selecting individual
pages in a multi-page (e.g. facsimile) file.</p>

<p>-e Force the generation of Encapsulated PostScript
(implies -z).</p>

<p>-h Specify the vertical size of the printed area (in
inches).</p>

<p>-H Specify the maximum height of image (in inches).
Images with larger sizes will be split in several pages.
Option -L may be used for specifying size of split images
overlapping.</p>

<p>-W Specify the maximum width of image (in inches).
Images with larger sizes will be split in several pages.
Options -L and -W are mutually exclusive. -i Enable/disable
pixel interpolation. This option requires a single numeric
value: zero to disable pixel interpolation and non-zero to
enable. The default is enabled.</p>

<p>-L Specify the size of overlapping for split images (in
inches). Used in conjunction with -H option.</p>

<p>-l Specify the left margin for the output (in inches).
This does not affect the width of the printed image.</p>

<p>-m Where possible render using the imagemask PostScript
operator instead of the image operator. When this option is
specified tiff2ps will use imagemask for rendering 1 bit
deep images. If this option is not specified or if the image
depth is greater than 1 then the image operator is used.</p>

<p>-o Set the initial TIFF directory to the IFD at the
specified file offset. This option is useful for selecting
thumbnail images and the like which are hidden using the
SubIFD tag.</p>

<p>-p Force the generation of (non-Encapsulated)
PostScript.</p>

<p>-r Rotate image by 180 degrees.</p>

<p>-s Generate output for a single IFD (page) in the input
file.</p>

<p>-w Specify the horizontal size of the printed area (in
inches).</p>

<p>-x Override resolution units specified in the TIFF as
centimeters.</p>

<p>-y Override resolution units specified in the TIFF as
inches.</p>

<p>-z When generating PostScript Level 2, data is scaled so
that it does not image into the deadzone on a page (the
outer margin that the printing device is unable to mark).
This option sup- presses this behavior. When PostScript
Level 1 is generated, data is imaged to the entire printed
page and this option has no affect.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following generates PostScript Level 2 for
all pages of a facsim- ile: tiff2ps -a2 fax.tif | lpr Note
also that if you have version 2.6.1 or newer of Ghostscript
then you can efficiently preview facsimile generated with
the above command.</p>

<p>To generate Encapsulated PostScript for a the image at
directory 2 of an image use: tiff2ps -d 1 foo.tif (Notice
that directories are numbered starting at zero.)</p>

<p>If you have a long image, it may be split in several
pages: tiff2ps -h11 -w8.5 -H14 -L.5 foo.tif &gt; foo.ps The
page size is set to 8.5x11 by -w and -h options. We will
accept a small amount of vertical compression, so -H set to
14. Any pages between 11 and 14 inches will be fit onto one
page. Pages longer than 14 inches are cut off at 11 and
continued on the next page. The -L.5 option says to repeat a
half inch on the next page (to improve read- ability).</p>

<p>BUGS Because PostScript does not support the notion of a
colormap, 8-bit palette images produce 24-bit PostScript
images. This conversion results in output that is six times
bigger than the original image and which takes a long time
to send to a printer over a serial line. Mat- ters are even
worse for 4-, 2-, and 1-bit palette images.</p>

<p>Does not handle tiled images when generating PostScript
Level I output.</p>
