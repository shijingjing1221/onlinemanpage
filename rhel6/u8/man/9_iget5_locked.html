<p>IGET5_LOCKED(9) The Linux VFS IGET5_LOCKED(9)</p>

<p>NAME iget5_locked - obtain an inode from a mounted file
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct inode * iget5_locked(struct super_block
* sb, unsigned long hashval, int (*test) (struct inode *,
void *), int (*set) (struct inode *, void *), void *
data);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS sb super block of file system</p>

<p>hashval hash value (usually inode number) to get</p>

<p>test callback used for comparisons between inodes</p>

<p>set callback used to initialize a new struct inode</p>

<p>data opaque data pointer to pass to test and set</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iget5_locked uses ifind to search for the
inode specified by hashval and data in the inode cache and
if present it is returned with an increased reference count.
This is a generalized version of iget_locked for file
systems where the inode number is not sufficient for unique
identification of an inode.</p>

<p>If the inode is not in cache, get_new_inode is called to
allocate a new inode and this is returned locked, hashed,
and with the I_NEW flag set. The file system gets to fill it
in before unlocking it via unlock_new_inode.</p>

<p>Note both test and set are called with the inode_lock
held, so can&acute;t sleep.</p>
