<p>SETSERIAL(8) SETSERIAL(8)</p>

<p>NAME setserial - get/set Linux serial port
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setserial [ -abqvVWz ] device [ parameter1 [
arg ] ] ...</p>

<p>setserial -g [ -abGv ] device1 ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setserial is a program designed to set
and/or report the configuration information associated with
a serial port. This information includes what I/O port and
IRQ a particular serial port is using, and whether or not
the break key should be interpreted as the Secure Attention
Key, and so on.</p>

<p>During the normal bootup process, only COM ports 1-4 are
initialized, using the default I/O ports and IRQ values, as
listed below. In order to initialize any additional serial
ports, or to change the COM 1-4 ports to a nonstadard
configuration, the setserial program should be used.
Typically it is called from an rc.serial script, which is
usu- ally run out of /etc/rc.local.</p>

<p>The device argument or arguments specifies the serial
device which should be configured or interrogated. It will
usually have the follow- ing form: /dev/cua[0-3].</p>

<p>If no parameters are specified, setserial will print out
the port type (i.e., 8250, 16450, 16550, 16550A, etc.), the
hardware I/O port, the hardware IRQ line, its &quot;baud
base,&quot; and some of its operational flags.</p>

<p>If the -g option is given, the arguments to setserial
are interpreted as a list of devices for which the
characteristics of those devices should be printed.</p>

<p>Without the -g option, the first argument to setserial
is interpreted as the device to be modified or
characteristics to be printed, and any additional arguments
are interpreted as parameters which should be assigned to
that serial device.</p>

<p>For the most part, superuser privilege is required to
set the configu- ration parameters of a serial port. A few
serial port parameters can be set by normal users, however,
and these will be noted as exceptions in this manual
page.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Setserial accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-a When reporting the configuration of a serial device,
print all available information.</p>

<p>-b When reporting the configuration of a serial device,
print a summary of the devices configuration, which might be
suitable for printing during the bootup process, during the
/etc/rc script.</p>

<p>-G Print out the configuration information of the serial
port in a form which can be fed back to setserial as
command-line argu- ments.</p>

<p>-q Be quiet. Setserial will print fewer lines of
output.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose. Setserial will print additional status
output.</p>

<p>-V Display version and exit.</p>

<p>-W Do wild interrupt initialization and exit. This
option is no longer relevant in Linux kernels after version
2.1.</p>

<p>-z Zero out the serial flags before starting to set
flags. This is related to the automatic saving of serial
flags using the -G flag.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS The following parameters can be assigned to a
serial port.</p>

<p>All argument values are assumed to be in decimal unless
preceeded by &quot;0x&quot;.</p>

<p>port port_number The port option sets the I/O port, as
described above.</p>

<p>irq irq_number The irq option sets the hardware IRQ, as
described above.</p>

<p>uart uart_type This option is used to set the UART type.
The permitted types are none, 8250, 16450, 16550, 16550A,
16650, 16650V2, 16654, 16750, 16850, 16950, and 16954. Using
UART type none will dis- able the port.</p>

<p>Some internal modems are billed as having a &quot;16550A
UART with a 1k buffer&quot;. This is a lie. They do not have
really have a 16550A compatible UART; instead what they have
is a 16450 com- patible UART with a 1k receive buffer to
prevent receiver over- runs. This is important, because they
do not have a transmit FIFO. Hence, they are not compatible
with a 16550A UART, and the autoconfiguration process will
correctly identify them as 16450s. If you attempt to
override this using the uart parame- ter, you will see
dropped characters during file transmissions. These UART s
usually have other problems: the skip_test parame- ter also
often must be specified.</p>

<p>autoconfig When this parameter is given, setserial will
ask the kernel to attempt to automatically configure the
serial port. The I/O port must be correctly set; the kernel
will attempt to determine the UART type, and if the auto_irq
parameter is set, Linux will attempt to automatically
determine the IRQ. The autoconfig parameter should be given
after the port,auto_irq, and skip_test parameters have been
specified.</p>

<p>auto_irq During autoconfiguration, try to determine the
IRQ. This fea- ture is not guaranteed to always produce the
correct result; some hardware configurations will fool the
Linux kernel. It is generally safer not to use the auto_irq
feature, but rather to specify the IRQ to be used
explicitly, using the irq parameter.</p>

<p>^auto_irq During autoconfiguration, do not try to
determine the IRQ.</p>

<p>skip_test During autoconfiguration, skip the UART test.
Some internal modems do not have National Semiconductor
compatible UARTs, but have cheap imitations instead. Some of
these cheasy imitations UARTs do not fully support the
loopback detection mode, which is used by the kernel to make
sure there really is a UART at a particular address before
attempting to configure it. So for certain internal modems
you will need to specify this parameter so Linux can
initialize the UART correctly.</p>

<p>^skip_test During autoconfiguration, do not skip the
UART test.</p>

<p>baud_base baud_base This option sets the base baud rate,
which is the clock fre- quency divided by 16. Normally this
value is 115200, which is also the fastest baud rate which
the UART can support.</p>

<p>spd_hi Use 57.6kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_vhi Use 115kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_shi Use 230kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_warp Use 460kb when the application requests 38.4kb.
This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>spd_cust Use the custom divisor to set the speed when
the application requests 38.4kb. In this case, the baud rate
is the baud_base divided by the divisor. This parameter may
be specified by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p>spd_normal Use 38.4kb when the application requests
38.4kb. This parameter may be specified by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<p>divisor divisor This option sets the custom divison.
This divisor will be used then the spd_cust option is
selected and the serial port is set to 38.4kb by the
application. This parameter may be specified by a
non-privileged user.</p>

<p>sak Set the break key at the Secure Attention Key.</p>

<p>^sak disable the Secure Attention Key.</p>

<p>fourport Configure the port as an AST Fourport card.</p>

<p>^fourport Disable AST Fourport configuration.</p>

<p>close_delay delay Specify the amount of time, in
hundredths of a second, that DTR should remain low on a
serial line after the callout device is closed, before the
blocked dialin device raises DTR again. The default value of
this option is 50, or a half-second delay.</p>

<p>closing_wait delay Specify the amount of time, in
hundredths of a second, that the kernel should wait for data
to be transmitted from the serial port while closing the
port. If &quot;none&quot; is specified, no delay will occur.
If &quot;infinite&quot; is specified the kernel will wait
indefinitely for the buffered data to be transmitted. The
default setting is 3000 or 30 seconds of delay. This default
is generally appropriate for most devices. If too long a
delay is selected, then the serial port may hang for a long
time if when a serial port which is not connected, and has
data pending, is closed. If too short a delay is selected,
then there is a risk that some of the transmitted data is
output at all. If the device is extremely slow, like a
plotter, the closing_wait may need to be larger.</p>

<p>session_lockout Lock out callout port (/dev/cuaXX)
accesses across different sessions. That is, once a process
has opened a port, do not allow a process with a different
session ID to open that port until the first process has
closed it.</p>

<p>^session_lockout Do not lock out callout port accesses
across different sessions.</p>

<p>pgrp_lockout Lock out callout port (/dev/cuaXX) accesses
across different process groups. That is, once a process has
opened a port, do not allow a process in a different process
group to open that port until the first process has closed
it.</p>

<p>^pgrp_lockout Do not lock out callout port accesses
across different process groups.</p>

<p>hup_notify Notify a process blocked on opening a dial in
line when a pro- cess has finished using a callout line
(either by closing it or by the serial line being hung up)
by returning EAGAIN to the open.</p>

<p>The application of this parameter is for gettys which
are blocked on a serial port s dial in line. This allows the
getty to reset the modem (which may have had its
configuration modi- fied by the application using the
callout device) before block- ing on the open again.</p>

<p>^hup_notify Do not notify a process blocked on opening a
dial in line when the callout device is hung up.</p>

<p>split_termios Treat the termios settings used by the
callout device and the termios settings used by the dialin
devices as separate.</p>

<p>^split_termios Use the same termios structure to store
both the dialin and callout ports. This is the default
option.</p>

<p>callout_nohup If this particular serial port is opened
as a callout device, do not hangup the tty when carrier
detect is dropped.</p>

<p>^callout_nohup Do not skip hanging up the tty when a
serial port is opened as a callout device. Of course, the
HUPCL termios flag must be enabled if the hangup is to
occur.</p>

<p>low_latency Minimize the receive latency of the serial
device at the cost of greater CPU utilization. (Normally
there is an average of 5-10ms latency before characters are
handed off to the line dis- cpline to minimize overhead.)
This is off by default, but cer- tain real-time applications
may find this useful.</p>

<p>^low_latency Optimize for efficient CPU processing of
serial characters at the cost of paying an average of 5-10ms
of latency before the characters are processed. This is the
default.</p>

<p>CONSIDERATIONS OF CONFIGURING SERIAL PORTS It is
important to note that setserial merely tells the Linux
kernel where it should expect to find the I/O port and IRQ
lines of a particu- lar serial port. It does *not* configure
the hardware, the actual serial board, to use a particular
I/O port. In order to do that, you will need to physically
program the serial board, usually by setting some jumpers or
by switching some DIP switches.</p>

<p>This section will provide some pointers in helping you
decide how you would like to configure your serial
ports.</p>

<p>The &quot;standard MS-DOS&quot; port associations are
given below:</p>

<p>/dev/ttys0 (COM1), port 0x3f8, irq 4 /dev/ttys1 (COM2),
port 0x2f8, irq 3 /dev/ttys2 (COM3), port 0x3e8, irq 4
/dev/ttys3 (COM4), port 0x2e8, irq 3</p>

<p>Due to the limitations in the design of the AT/ISA bus
architecture, normally an IRQ line may not be shared between
two or more serial ports. If you attempt to do this, one or
both serial ports will become unreliable if you try to use
both simultaneously. This limitation can be overcome by
special multi-port serial port boards, which are designed to
share multiple serial ports over a single IRQ line. Multi-
port serial cards supported by Linux include the AST
FourPort, the Accent Async board, the Usenet Serial II
board, the Bocaboard BB-1004, BB-1008, and BB-2016 boards,
and the HUB-6 serial board.</p>

<p>The selection of an alternative IRQ line is difficult,
since most of them are already used. The following table
lists the &quot;standard MS-DOS&quot; assignments of
available IRQ lines:</p>

<p>IRQ 3: COM2 IRQ 4: COM1 IRQ 5: LPT2 IRQ 7: LPT1</p>

<p>Most people find that IRQ 5 is a good choice, assuming
that there is only one parallel port active in the computer.
Another good choice is IRQ 2 (aka IRQ 9); although this IRQ
is sometimes used by network cards, and very rarely VGA
cards will be configured to use IRQ 2 as a vertical retrace
interrupt. If your VGA card is configured this way; try to
disable it so you can reclaim that IRQ line for some other
card. Its not necessary for Linux and most other Operating
systems.</p>

<p>The only other available IRQ lines are 3, 4, and 7, and
these are prob- ably used by the other serial and parallel
ports. (If your serial card has a 16bit card edge connector,
and supports higher interrupt numbers, then IRQ 10, 11, 12,
and 15 are also available.)</p>

<p>On AT class machines, IRQ 2 is seen as IRQ 9, and Linux
will interpret it in this manner.</p>

<p>IRQ s other than 2 (9), 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 15,
should not be used, since they are assigned to other
hardware and cannot, in general, be changed. Here are the
&quot;standard&quot; assignments:</p>

<p>IRQ 0 Timer channel 0 IRQ 1 Keyboard IRQ 2 Cascade for
controller 2 IRQ 3 Serial port 2 IRQ 4 Serial port 1 IRQ 5
Parallel port 2 (Reserved in PS/2) IRQ 6 Floppy diskette IRQ
7 Parallel port 1 IRQ 8 Real-time clock IRQ 9 Redirected to
IRQ2 IRQ 10 Reserved IRQ 11 Reserved IRQ 12 Reserved
(Auxillary device in PS/2) IRQ 13 Math coprocessor IRQ 14
Hard disk controller IRQ 15 Reserved</p>

<p>MULTIPORT CONFIGURATION Certain multiport serial boards
which share multiple ports on a single IRQ use one or more
ports to indicate whether or not there are any pending ports
which need to be serviced. If your multiport board sup-
ports these ports, you should make use of them to avoid
potential lock- ups if the interrupt gets lost.</p>

<p>In order to set these ports specify set_multiport as a
parameter, and follow it with the multiport parameters. The
multiport parameters take the form of specifying the port
that should be checked, a mask which indicate which bits in
the register are significant, and finally, a match parameter
which specifies what the significant bits in that reg- ister
must match when there is no more pending work to be
done.</p>

<p>Up to four such port/mask/match combinations may be
specified. The first such combinations should be specified
by setting the parameters port1, mask1, and match1. The
second such combination should be speci- fied with port2,
mask2, and match2, and so on. In order to disable this
multiport checking, set port1 to be zero.</p>

<p>In order to view the current multiport settings, specify
the parameter get_multiport on the command line.</p>

<p>Here are some multiport settings for some common serial
boards:</p>

<p>AST FourPort port1 0x1BF mask1 0xf match1 0xf</p>

<p>Boca BB-1004/8 port1 0x107 mask1 0xff match1 0</p>

<p>Boca BB-2016 port1 0x107 mask1 0xff match1 0 port2 0x147
mask2 0xff match2 0</p>

<p>Hayes ESP Configuration Setserial may also be used to
configure ports on a Hayes ESP serial board.</p>

<p>The following parameters when configuring ESP ports:</p>

<p>rx_trigger This is the trigger level (in bytes) of the
receive FIFO. Larger values may result in fewer interrupts
and hence better perfor- mance; however, a value too high
could result in data loss. Valid values are 1 through
1023.</p>

<p>tx_trigger This is the trigger level (in bytes) of the
transmit FIFO. Larger values may result in fewer interrupts
and hence better performance; however, a value too high
could result in degraded transmit performance. Valid values
are 1 through 1023.</p>

<p>flow_off This is the level (in bytes) at which the ESP
port will &quot;flow off&quot; the remote transmitter (i.e.
tell him to stop stop sending more bytes). Valid values are
1 through 1023. This value should be greater than the
receive trigger level and the flow on level.</p>

<p>flow_on This is the level (in bytes) at which the ESP
port will &quot;flow on&quot; the remote transmitter (i.e.
tell him to resume sending bytes) after having flowed it
off. Valid values are 1 through 1023. This value should be
less than the flow off level, but greater than the receive
trigger level.</p>

<p>rx_timeout This is the amount of time that the ESP port
will wait after receiving the final character before
signaling an interrupt. Valid values are 0 through 255. A
value too high will increase latency, and a value too low
will cause unnecessary interrupts.</p>

<p>CAUTION CAUTION: Configuring a serial port to use an
incorrect I/O port can lock up your machine.</p>
