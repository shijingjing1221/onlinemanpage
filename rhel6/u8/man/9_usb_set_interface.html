<p>NAME usb_set_interface - Makes a particular alternate
setting be current</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_set_interface(struct usb_device * dev,
int interface, int alternate);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev the device whose interface is being
updated</p>

<p>interface the interface being updated</p>

<p>alternate the setting being chosen.</p>

<p>CONTEXT !in_interrupt ()</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is used to enable data transfers on
interfaces that may not be enabled by default. Not all
devices support such configurability. Only the driver bound
to an interface may change its setting.</p>

<p>Within any given configuration, each interface may have
several alternative settings. These are often used to
control levels of bandwidth consumption. For example, the
default setting for a high speed interrupt endpoint may not
send more than 64 bytes per microframe, while interrupt
transfers of up to 3KBytes per microframe are legal. Also,
isochronous endpoints may never be part of an
interface&acute;s default setting. To access such bandwidth,
alternate interface settings must be made current.</p>

<p>Note that in the Linux USB subsystem, bandwidth
associated with an endpoint in a given alternate setting is
not reserved until an URB is submitted that needs that
bandwidth. Some other operating systems allocate bandwidth
early, when a configuration is chosen.</p>

<p>This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an
interrupt context. Also, drivers must not change altsettings
while urbs are scheduled for endpoints in that interface;
all such urbs must first be completed (perhaps forced by
unlinking).</p>

<p>Returns zero on success, or else the status code
returned by the underlying usb_control_msg call.</p>
