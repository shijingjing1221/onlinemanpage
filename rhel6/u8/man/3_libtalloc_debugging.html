<p>libtalloc_debugging(3) talloc libtalloc_debugging(3)</p>

<p>NAME libtalloc_debugging - Chapter 6: Debugging Although
talloc makes memory management significantly easier than the
C standard library, developers are still only humans and can
make mistakes.</p>

<p>Therefore, it can be handy to know some tools for the
inspection of talloc memory usage.</p>

<p>Talloc log and abort We have already encountered the
abort function in section Dynamic type system. In that case
it was used when a type mismatch was detected. However,
talloc calls this abort function in several more
situations:</p>

<p>&middot; when the provided pointer is not a valid talloc
context,</p>

<p>&middot; when the meta data is invalid - probably due to
memory corruption,</p>

<p>&middot; and when an access after free is detected.</p>

<p>The third one is probably the most interesting. It can
help us with detecting an attempt to double-free a context
or any other manipulation with it via talloc functions
(using it as a parent, stealing it, etc.).</p>

<p>Before the context is freed talloc sets a flag in the
meta data. This is then used to detect the access after
free. It basically works on the assumption that the memory
stays unchanged (at least for a while) even when it is
properly deallocated. This will work even if the memory is
filled with the value specified in TALLOC_FREE_FILL
environment variable, because it fills only the data part
and leaves the meta data intact.</p>

<p>Apart from the abort function, talloc uses a log
function to provide additional information to the
aforementioned violations. To enable logging we shall set
the log function with one of:</p>

<p>&middot; talloc_set_log_fn()</p>

<p>&middot; talloc_set_log_stderr()</p>

<p>The following code is a sample output of accessing a
context after it has been freed:</p>

<p>talloc_set_log_stderr(); TALLOC_CTX *ctx =
talloc_new(NULL);</p>

<p>talloc_free(ctx); talloc_free(ctx);</p>

<p>results in: talloc: access after free error - first free
may be at ../src/main.c:55 Bad talloc magic value - access
after free</p>

<p>Another example is an invalid context:</p>

<p>talloc_set_log_stderr(); TALLOC_CTX *ctx =
talloc_new(NULL); char *str = strdup(not a talloc context);
talloc_steal(ctx, str);</p>

<p>results in: Bad talloc magic value - unknown value</p>

<p>Memory usage reports Talloc can print reports of memory
usage of a specified talloc context to a file (to stdout or
stderr). The report can be simple or full. The simple report
provides information only about the context itself and its
direct descendants. The full report goes recursively through
the entire context tree. See:</p>

<p>&middot; talloc_report()</p>

<p>&middot; talloc_report_full()</p>

<p>We will use the following code to retrieve the sample
report:</p>

<p>struct foo { char *str; };</p>

<p>TALLOC_CTX *ctx = talloc_new(NULL); char *str =
talloc_strdup(ctx, my string); struct foo *foo =
talloc_zero(ctx, struct foo); foo-&gt;str =
talloc_strdup(foo, I am Foo); char *str2 =
talloc_strdup(foo, Foo is my parent);</p>

<p>/* print full report */ talloc_report_full(ctx,
stdout);</p>

<p>It will print a full report of ctx to the standard
output. The message should be similar to:</p>

<p>full talloc report on talloc_new: ../src/main.c:82
(total 46 bytes in 5 blocks) struct foo contains 34 bytes in
3 blocks (ref 0) 0x1495130 Foo is my parent contains 17
bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0) 0x1495200 I am Foo contains 9
bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0) 0x1495190 my string contains 10
bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0) 0x14950c0</p>

<p>We can notice in this report that something is wrong
with the context containing struct foo. We know that the
structure has only one string element. However, we can see
in the report that it has two children. This indicates that
we have either violated the memory hierarchy or forgotten to
free it as temporary data. Looking into the code, we can see
that Foo is my parent should be attached to ctx.</p>
