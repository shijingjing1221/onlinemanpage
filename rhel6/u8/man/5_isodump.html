<p>NAME isodump - format of IEEE 1394 isochronous packets
dump file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The isodump format stores a series of IEEE
1394 isochronous stream packets (possibly from multiple
channels), including their headers. Its main use is as the
output format of dumpiso(1) and the input format of
sendiso(1).</p>

<p>The 32 byte header starts at offset 0 with the string
&quot;1394 isodump v1&quot; followed by a zero byte. The
next 8 bytes form a 64 bit big endian integer, which
represents a bit mask of the channels that were dumped. A
set bit at position (1 &lt;&lt; x) signifies that channel x
was being lis- tened on. The following 8 bytes are set to
zero.</p>

<p>The iso packets follow the header and are appended to
the data stream in the order they were received. The packets
consist of the header quadlet as originally received and the
data quadlets following directly. The CRC quadlets after
header and data do not appear and everything is in big
endian, as seen on the bus.</p>

<p>There is no further framing of the packets in the
format, packet bound- aries can be found by looking at the
data size field in the header quadlet of each packet. The
data size field appears in the most sig- nificant 16 bits of
the header quadlet, contain the size in bytes (the actual
packet is padded to a multiple of four bytes) and do not
include the header packet.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY This format was introduced with the iso
send and dump tools distributed with libraw1394. No one else
uses it so far.</p>
