<p>NAME mcelog - Decode kernel machine check log on x86
machines</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mcelog [options] [device] mcelog [options]
--daemon mcelog [options] --client mcelog [options] --ascii
mcelog [options] --is-cpu-supported mcelog --version mcelog
--supported</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION X86 CPUs report errors detected by the CPU
as machine check events (MCEs). These can be data corruption
detected in the CPU caches, in main memory by an integrated
memory controller, data transfer errors on the front side
bus or CPU interconnect or other internal errors. Pos- sible
causes can be cosmic radiation, instable power supplies,
cooling problems, broken hardware, running systems out of
specification, or bad luck.</p>

<p>Most errors can be corrected by the CPU by internal
error correction mechanisms. Uncorrected errors cause
machine check exceptions which may kill processes or panic
the machine. A small number of corrected errors is usually
not a cause for worry, but a large number can indicate
future failure.</p>

<p>When a corrected or recovered error happens the x86
kernel writes a record describing the MCE into a internal
ring buffer available through the /dev/mcelog device mcelog
retrieves errors from /dev/mcelog, decodes them into a human
readable format and prints them on the stan- dard output or
optionally into the system log.</p>

<p>Optionally it can also take more options like keeping
statistics or triggering shell scripts on specific events.
By default mcelog supports offlining memory pages with
persistent corrected errors, offlining CPU cores if they
developed cache problems, and otherwise logging specific
events to the system log after they crossed a threshold.</p>

<p>The normal operating modi for mcelog are running as a
regular cron job (traditional way, deprecated), running as a
trigger directly executed by the kernel, or running as a
daemon with the --daemon option.</p>

<p>When an uncorrected machine check error happens that the
kernel cannot recover from then it will usually panic the
system. In this case when there was a warm reset after the
panic mcelog should pick up the machine check errors after
reboot. This is not possible after a cold reset.</p>

<p>In addition mcelog can be used on the command line to
decode the kernel output for a fatal machine check panic in
text format using the --ascii option. This is typically used
to decode the panic console output of a fatal machine check,
if the system was power cycled or mcelog didnt run
immediately after reboot.</p>

<p>When the panic triggers a kdump kexec crash kernel the
crash kernel boot up script should log the machine checks to
disk, otherwise they might be lost.</p>

<p>Note that after mcelog retrieves an error the kernel
doesnt store it anymore (different from dmesg(1)), so the
output should be always saved somewhere and mcelog not run
in uncontrolled ways.</p>

<p>When invoked with the --is-cpu-supported option mcelog
exits with code 0 if the current CPU is supported, 1
otherwise.</p>

<p>OPTIONS When the --syslog option is specified redirect
output to system log. The --syslog-error option causes the
normal machine checks to be logged as LOG_ERR (implies
--syslog ). Normally only fatal errors or high level remarks
are logged with error level. High level one line sum- maries
of specific errors are also logged to the syslog by default
unless mcelog operates in --ascii mode.</p>

<p>When the --logfile=file option is specified append log
output to the specified file. With the --no-syslog option
mcelog will never log any- thing to the syslog.</p>

<p>When the --cpu=cputype option is specified set the to be
decoded CPU to cputype. See mcelog --help for a list of
valid CPUs. Note that speci- fying an incorrect CPU can lead
to incorrect decoding output. Default is either the CPU of
the machine that reported the machine check (needs a newer
kernel version) or the CPU of the machine mcelog is running
on, so normally this option doesnt have to be used. Older
versions of mcelog had separate options for different CPU
types. These are still implemented, but deprecated and
undocumented now.</p>

<p>With the --dmi option mcelog will look up the DIMMs
reported in machine checks in the SMBIOS/DMI tables of the
BIOS and map the DIMMs to board identifiers. This only works
when the BIOS reports the identifiers correctly.
Unfortunately often the information reported by the BIOS is
either subtly or obviously wrong or useless. This option
requires that mcelog has read access to /dev/mem (normally
requires root) and runs on the same machine in the same
hardware configuration as when the machine check event
happened.</p>

<p>When --ignorenodev is specified then mcelog will exit
silently when the device cannot be opened. This is useful in
virtualized environment with limited devices.</p>

<p>When --filter is specified mcelog will filter out known
broken machine check events (default on). When the
--no-filter option is specified mcelog does not filter
events.</p>

<p>When --raw is specified mcelog will not decode, but just
dump the mcelog in a raw hex format. This can be useful for
automatic post pro- cessing.</p>

<p>When a device is specified the machine check logs are
read from device instead of the default /dev/mcelog.</p>

<p>With the --ascii option mcelog decodes a fatal machine
check panic gen- erated by the kernel (&quot;CPU n: Machine
Check Exception ...&quot;) in ASCII from standard input and
exits afterwards. Note that when the panic comes from a
different machine than where mcelog is running on you might
need to specify the correct cputype on older kernels. On
newer kernels which output the PROCESSOR field this is not
needed anymore.</p>

<p>When the --file filename option is specified mcelog
--ascii will read the ASCII machine check record from input
file filename instead of standard input.</p>

<p>With the --config-file file option mcelog reads the
specified config file. Default is /etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf
See also CONFIG FILE below.</p>

<p>With the --daemon option mcelog will run in the
background. This gives the fastest reaction time and is the
recommended operating mode. If an output option isnt
selected ( --logfile or --syslog or --syslog-error ), this
option implies --logfile=/var/log/mcelog. Important messages
will be logged as one-liner summaries to syslog unless
--no-syslog is given. The option --foreground will prevent
mcelog from giving up the terminal in daemon mode. This is
intended for debugging.</p>

<p>With the --client option mcelog will query a running
daemon for accumu- lated errors.</p>

<p>With the --cpumhz=mhz option assume the CPU has mhz
frequency for decoding the time of the event using the CPU
time stamp counter. This also forces decoding. Note this can
be unreliable. on some systems with CPU frequency scaling or
deep C states, where the CPU time stamp counter does not
increase linearly. By default the frequency of the current
CPU is used when mcelog determines it is safe to use. Newer
kernels report the time directly in the event and dont need
this any- more.</p>

<p>The --pidfile file option writes the process id of the
daemon into file file. Only valid in daemon mode.</p>

<p>Mcelog will enable extended error reporting from the
memory controller on processors that support it unless you
tell it not to with the --no- imc-log option. You might need
this option when decoding old logs from a system where this
mode was not enabled.</p>

<p>--version displays the version of mcelog and exits.</p>

<p>--supported returns 0 if the system has processors which
support MCE, and 1 otherwise.</p>

<p>CONFIG FILE mcelog supports a config file to set
defaults. Command line options override the config file. By
default the config file is read from /etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf
unless overridden with the --config-file option.</p>

<p>The general format is optionname = value White space is
not allowed in value currently, except at the end where it
is dropped Comments start with #.</p>

<p>All command line options that are not commands can be
specified in the config file. For example t to enable the
--no-syslog option use no- syslog = yes (or no to disable).
When the option has a argument use logfile =
/tmp/logfile</p>

<p>For more information on the config file please see
mcelog.conf(5).</p>

<p>NOTES The kernel prefers old messages over new. If the
log buffer overflows only old ones will be kept.</p>

<p>The exact output in the log file depends on the CPU,
unless the --raw option is used.</p>

<p>mcelog will report serious errors to the syslog during
decoding.</p>

<p>SIGNALS When mcelog runs in daemon mode and receives a
SIGUSR1 it will close and reopen the log files. This can be
used to rotate logs without restarting the daemon.</p>
