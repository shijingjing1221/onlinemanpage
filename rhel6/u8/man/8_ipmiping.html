<p>IPMIPING(8) System Commands IPMIPING(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipmiping - send IPMI Get Authentication Capabilitiy
request to network hosts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipmiping [OPTION...] destination</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipmiping uses the IPMI Get Channel
Authentication Capabilities request datagram to elicit an
IPMI Get Channel Authentication Capabilitiesl response from
a remote host. The utility can be used to verify if a remote
host supports IPMI. The initial starting sequence number
will be randomized.</p>

<p>ipmiping will return 0 to the environment if it receives
atleast 1 response from the remote host. Otherwise, it
exists with a value of 1.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are available</p>

<p>-h Output help menu.</p>

<p>-V Output version.</p>

<p>-c count Stop after sending count packets.</p>

<p>-i interval Wait interval seconds between sending each
packet. The default is to wait for one second between each
packet.</p>

<p>-I interface address Set source address to specified
interface address. Argument may be numeric IP address or
name of device.</p>

<p>-t timeout Time to wait for a response, in seconds.
Default is five sec- onds.</p>

<p>-v Verbose output.</p>

<p>-s num Specify an initial starting sequence number. The
default is to use a random initial sequence number.</p>

<p>-d Turn on debugging.</p>

<p>-r version Specify IPMI version. Available options are
&quot;1.5&quot; and &quot;2.0&quot;. Default is to use
&quot;1.5&quot;. Note that packets will always be sent with
the IPMI 1.5 protocol, but IPMI 1.5 vs IPMI 2.0 relevant
fields will be communicated in the Get Channel
Authentication Capabilities datagram depending on user
choice.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES It has been observed that some remote BMCs
can get &quot;confused&quot; and delay packet responses if
duplicate packets (with duplicate sequence numbers) are sent
in succession very quickly. There is no known way to cleanly
deal with a &quot;confused&quot; BMC other than the wait
awhile.</p>

<p>Unlike ping(8), local network devicess (e.g. 127.0.0.1)
cannot be &quot;pinged&quot;.</p>
