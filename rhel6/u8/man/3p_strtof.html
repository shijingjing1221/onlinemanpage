<p>STRTOD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRTOD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strtod, strtof, strtold - convert a string to a
double-precision number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>double strtod(const char *restrict nptr, char **restrict
endptr); float strtof(const char *restrict nptr, char
**restrict endptr); long double strtold(const char *restrict
nptr, char **restrict endptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall convert the initial
portion of the string pointed to by nptr to double, float,
and long double representation, respec- tively. First, they
decompose the input string into three parts:</p>

<p>1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space
characters (as specified by isspace())</p>

<p>2. A subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point
constant or rep- resenting infinity or NaN</p>

<p>3. A final string of one or more unrecognized
characters, including the terminating null byte of the input
string</p>

<p>Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence
to a floating- point number, and return the result.</p>

<p>The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional
plus or minus sign, then one of the following:</p>

<p>* A non-empty sequence of decimal digits optionally
containing a radix character, then an optional exponent
part</p>

<p>* A 0x or 0X, then a non-empty sequence of hexadecimal
digits option- ally containing a radix character, then an
optional binary exponent part</p>

<p>* One of INF or INFINITY, ignoring case</p>

<p>* One of NAN or NAN(n-char-sequence_opt), ignoring case
in the NAN part, where:</p>

<p>n-char-sequence: digit nondigit n-char-sequence digit
n-char-sequence nondigit</p>

<p>The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
subsequence of the input string, starting with the first
non-white-space character, that is of the expected form. The
subject sequence contains no charac- ters if the input
string is not of the expected form.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the expected form for a
floating-point num- ber, the sequence of characters starting
with the first digit or the decimal-point character
(whichever occurs first) shall be interpreted as a floating
constant of the C language, except that the radix charac-
ter shall be used in place of a period, and that if neither
an exponent part nor a radix character appears in a decimal
floating-point number, or if a binary exponent part does not
appear in a hexadecimal floating- point number, an exponent
part of the appropriate type with value zero is assumed to
follow the last digit in the string. If the subject sequence
begins with a minus sign, the sequence shall be interpreted
as negated. A character sequence INF or INFINITY shall be
interpreted as an infinity, if representable in the return
type, else as if it were a floating constant that is too
large for the range of the return type. A character sequence
NAN or NAN(n-char-sequence_opt) shall be interpreted as a
quiet NaN, if supported in the return type, else as if it
were a subject sequence part that does not have the expected
form; the meaning of the n-char sequences is
implementation-defined. A pointer to the final string is
stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that
endptr is not a null pointer.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and
FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the value resulting from the
conversion is correctly rounded.</p>

<p>The radix character is defined in the program s locale
(category LC_NUMERIC ). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale
where the radix char- acter is not defined, the radix
character shall default to a period ( .).</p>

<p>In other than the C or POSIX locales, other
implementation-defined subject sequences may be
accepted.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the
expected form, no conversion shall be performed; the value
of str is stored in the object pointed to by endptr,
provided that endptr is not a null pointer.</p>

<p>The strtod() function shall not change the setting of
errno if success- ful.</p>

<p>Since 0 is returned on error and is also a valid return
on success, an application wishing to check for error
situations should set errno to 0, then call strtod(),
strtof(), or strtold(), then check errno.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the converted value. If no conversion could be
performed, 0 shall be returned, and errno may be set to
[EINVAL].</p>

<p>If the correct value is outside the range of
representable values, &plusmn;HUGE_VAL, &plusmn;HUGE_VALF,
or &plusmn;HUGE_VALL shall be returned (according to the
sign of the value), and errno shall be set to [ERANGE].</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause an underflow, a value
whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest normalized
positive number in the return type shall be returned and
errno set to [ERANGE].</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>ERANGE The value to be returned would cause overflow or
underflow.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL No conversion could be performed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the subject sequence has the
hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, and the
result is not exactly representable, the result should be
one of the two numbers in the appropriate internal format
that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating source value,
with the extra stipulation that the error should have a
correct sign for the current rounding direction.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most
DECIMAL_DIG (defined in &lt;float.h&gt;) significant digits,
the result should be cor- rectly rounded. If the subject
sequence D has the decimal form and more than DECIMAL_DIG
significant digits, consider the two bounding, adja- cent
decimal strings L and U, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant
dig- its, such that the values of L, D, and U satisfy L
&lt;= D &lt;= U. The result should be one of the (equal or
adjacent) values that would be obtained by correctly
rounding L and U according to the current round- ing
direction, with the extra stipulation that the error with
respect to D should have a correct sign for the current
rounding direction.</p>

<p>The changes to strtod() introduced by the ISO/IEC
9899:1999 standard can alter the behavior of well-formed
applications complying with the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard
and thus earlier versions of the base docu- ments. One such
example would be:</p>

<p>int what_kind_of_number (char *s) { char *endp; double
d; long l;</p>

<p>d = strtod(s, &amp;endp); if (s != endp &amp;&amp; *endp
=) printf(&quot;Is a float with value %n&quot;, d); else { l
= strtol(s, &amp;endp, 0); if (s != endp &amp;&amp; *endp =)
printf(&quot;Its an integer with value %ln&quot;, 1); else
return 1; } return 0; }</p>

<p>If the function is called with:</p>

<p>what_kind_of_number (&quot;0x10&quot;)</p>

<p>an ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard-compliant library will
result in the function printing:</p>

<p>Is an integer with value 16</p>

<p>With the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, the result is:</p>

<p>Is a float with value 16</p>

<p>The change in behavior is due to the inclusion of
floating-point num- bers in hexadecimal notation without
requiring that either a decimal point or the binary exponent
be present.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
