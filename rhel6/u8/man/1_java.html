<p>NAME java - Launches a Java application.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS java [options] classname [args]</p>

<p>java [options] -jar filename [args]</p>

<p>options Command-line options separated by spaces. See
Options.</p>

<p>classname The name of the class to be launched.</p>

<p>filename The name of the Java Archive (JAR) file to be
called. Used only with the -jar option.</p>

<p>args The arguments passed to the main() method separated
by spaces.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The java command starts a Java application.
It does this by starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
loading the specified class, and calling that class&rsquo;s
main() method. The method must be declared public and
static, it must not return any value, and it must accept a
String array as a parameter. The method declaration has the
following form:</p>

<p>public static void main(String[] args)</p>

<p>The java command can be used to launch a JavaFX
application by loading a class that either has a main()
method or that extends javafx.application.Application. In
the latter case, the launcher constructs an instance of the
Application class, calls its init() method, and then calls
the start(javafx.stage.Stage) method.</p>

<p>By default, the first argument that is not an option of
the java command is the fully qualified name of the class to
be called. If the -jar option is specified, its argument is
the name of the JAR file containing class and resource files
for the application. The startup class must be indicated by
the Main-Class manifest header in its source code.</p>

<p>The JRE searches for the startup class (and other
classes used by the application) in three sets of locations:
the bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the
users class path.</p>

<p>Arguments after the class file name or the JAR file name
are passed to the main() method.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The java command supports a wide range of
options that can be divided into the following
categories:</p>

<p>&middot; Standard Options</p>

<p>&middot; Non-Standard Options</p>

<p>&middot; Advanced Runtime Options</p>

<p>&middot; Advanced JIT Compiler Options</p>

<p>&middot; Advanced Serviceability Options</p>

<p>&middot; Advanced Garbage Collection Options</p>

<p>Standard options are guaranteed to be supported by all
implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). They are
used for common actions, such as checking the version of the
JRE, setting the class path, enabling verbose output, and so
on.</p>

<p>Non-standard options are general purpose options that
are specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine, so they
are not guaranteed to be supported by all JVM
implementations, and are subject to change. These options
start with -X.</p>

<p>Advanced options are not recommended for casual use.
These are developer options used for tuning specific areas
of the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine operation that often
have specific system requirements and may require privileged
access to system configuration parameters. They are also not
guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations, and
are subject to change. Advanced options start with -XX.</p>

<p>To keep track of the options that were deprecated or
removed in the latest release, there is a section named
Deprecated and Removed Options at the end of the
document.</p>

<p>Boolean options are used to either enable a feature that
is disabled by default or disable a feature that is enabled
by default. Such options do not require a parameter. Boolean
-XX options are enabled using the plus sign
(-XX:+OptionName) and disabled using the minus sign
(-XX:-OptionName).</p>

<p>For options that require an argument, the argument may
be separated from the option name by a space, a colon (:),
or an equal sign (=), or the argument may directly follow
the option (the exact syntax differs for each option). If
you are expected to specify the size in bytes, you can use
no suffix, or use the suffix k or K for kilobytes (KB), m or
M for megabytes (MB), g or G for gigabytes (GB). For
example, to set the size to 8 GB, you can specify either 8g,
8192m, 8388608k, or 8589934592 as the argument. If you are
expected to specify the percentage, use a number from 0 to 1
(for example, specify 0.25 for 25%).</p>

<p>Standard Options These are the most commonly used
options that are supported by all implementations of the
JVM.</p>

<p>-agentlib:libname[=options] Loads the specified native
agent library. After the library name, a comma-separated
list of options specific to the library can be used.</p>

<p>If the option -agentlib:foo is specified, then the JVM
attempts to load the library named libfoo.so in the location
specified by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH system variable (on OS X
this variable is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).</p>

<p>The following example shows how to load the heap
profiling tool (HPROF) library and get sample CPU
information every 20 ms, with a stack depth of 3:</p>

<p>-agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,interval=20,depth=3</p>

<p>The following example shows how to load the Java Debug
Wire Protocol (JDWP) library and listen for the socket
connection on port 8000, suspending the JVM before the main
class loads:</p>


<p>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000</p>

<p>For more information about the native agent libraries,
refer to the following:</p>

<p>&middot; The java.lang.instrument package description at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html</p>

<p>&middot; Agent Command Line Options in the JVM Tools
Interface guide at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting</p>

<p>-agentpath:pathname[=options] Loads the native agent
library specified by the absolute path name. This option is
equivalent to -agentlib but uses the full path and file name
of the library.</p>

<p>-client Selects the Java HotSpot Client VM. The 64-bit
version of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) currently
ignores this option and instead uses the Server JVM.</p>

<p>For default JVM selection, see Server-Class Machine
Detection at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p>-Dproperty=value Sets a system property value. The
property variable is a string with no spaces that represents
the name of the property. The value variable is a string
that represents the value of the property. If value is a
string with spaces, then enclose it in quotation marks (for
example -Dfoo=&quot;foo bar&quot;).</p>

<p>-d32 Runs the application in a 32-bit environment. If a
32-bit environment is not installed or is not supported,
then an error will be reported. By default, the application
is run in a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit system is
used.</p>

<p>-d64 Runs the application in a 64-bit environment. If a
64-bit environment is not installed or is not supported,
then an error will be reported. By default, the application
is run in a 32-bit environment unless a 64-bit system is
used.</p>

<p>Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports
64-bit operation, and the -server option is implicit with
the use of -d64. The -client option is ignored with the use
of -d64. This is subject to change in a future release.</p>

<p>-disableassertions[:[packagename]...|:classname]
-da[:[packagename]...|:classname] Disables assertions. By
default, assertions are disabled in all packages and
classes.</p>

<p>With no arguments, -disableassertions (-da) disables
assertions in all packages and classes. With the packagename
argument ending in ..., the switch disables assertions in
the specified package and any subpackages. If the argument
is simply ..., then the switch disables assertions in the
unnamed package in the current working directory. With the
classname argument, the switch disables assertions in the
specified class.</p>

<p>The -disableassertions (-da) option applies to all class
loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class
loader). There is one exception to this rule: if the option
is provided with no arguments, then it does not apply to
system classes. This makes it easy to disable assertions in
all classes except for system classes. The
-disablesystemassertions option enables you to disable
assertions in all system classes.</p>

<p>To explicitly enable assertions in specific packages or
classes, use the -enableassertions (-ea) option. Both
options can be used at the same time. For example, to run
the MyClass application with assertions enabled in package
com.wombat.fruitbat (and any subpackages) but disabled in
class com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, use the following
command:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat MyClass</p>

<p>-disablesystemassertions -dsa Disables assertions in all
system classes.</p>

<p>-enableassertions[:[packagename]...|:classname]
-ea[:[packagename]...|:classname] Enables assertions. By
default, assertions are disabled in all packages and
classes.</p>

<p>With no arguments, -enableassertions (-ea) enables
assertions in all packages and classes. With the packagename
argument ending in ..., the switch enables assertions in the
specified package and any subpackages. If the argument is
simply ..., then the switch enables assertions in the
unnamed package in the current working directory. With the
classname argument, the switch enables assertions in the
specified class.</p>

<p>The -enableassertions (-ea) option applies to all class
loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class
loader). There is one exception to this rule: if the option
is provided with no arguments, then it does not apply to
system classes. This makes it easy to enable assertions in
all classes except for system classes. The
-enablesystemassertions option provides a separate switch to
enable assertions in all system classes.</p>

<p>To explicitly disable assertions in specific packages or
classes, use the -disableassertions (-da) option. If a
single command contains multiple instances of these
switches, then they are processed in order before loading
any classes. For example, to run the MyClass application
with assertions enabled only in package com.wombat.fruitbat
(and any subpackages) but disabled in class
com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, use the following command:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat MyClass</p>

<p>-enablesystemassertions -esa Enables assertions in all
system classes.</p>

<p>-help -? Displays usage information for the java command
without actually running the JVM.</p>

<p>-jar filename Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR
file. The filename argument is the name of a JAR file with a
manifest that contains a line in the form
Main-Class:classname that defines the class with the public
static void main(String[] args) method that serves as your
application&rsquo;s starting point.</p>

<p>When you use the -jar option, the specified JAR file is
the source of all user classes, and other class path
settings are ignored.</p>

<p>For more information about JAR files, see the following
resources:</p>

<p>&middot; jar(1)</p>

<p>&middot; The Java Archive (JAR) Files guide at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/index.html</p>

<p>&middot; Lesson: Packaging Programs in JAR Files at</p>


<p>http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/index.html</p>

<p>-javaagent:jarpath[=options] Loads the specified Java
programming language agent. For more information about
instrumenting Java applications, see the
java.lang.instrument package description in the Java API
documentation at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html</p>

<p>-jre-restrict-search Includes user-private JREs in the
version search.</p>

<p>-no-jre-restrict-search Excludes user-private JREs from
the version search.</p>

<p>-server Selects the Java HotSpot Server VM. The 64-bit
version of the JDK supports only the Server VM, so in that
case the option is implicit.</p>

<p>For default JVM selection, see Server-Class Machine
Detection at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p>-showversion Displays version information and continues
execution of the application. This option is equivalent to
the -version option except that the latter instructs the JVM
to exit after displaying version information.</p>

<p>-splash:imgname Shows the splash screen with the image
specified by imgname. For example, to show the splash.gif
file from the images directory when starting your
application, use the following option:</p>

<p>-splash:images/splash.gif</p>

<p>-verbose:class Displays information about each loaded
class.</p>

<p>-verbose:gc Displays information about each garbage
collection (GC) event.</p>

<p>-verbose:jni Displays information about the use of
native methods and other Java Native Interface (JNI)
activity.</p>

<p>-version Displays version information and then exits.
This option is equivalent to the -showversion option except
that the latter does not instruct the JVM to exit after
displaying version information.</p>

<p>-version:release Specifies the release version to be
used for running the application. If the version of the java
command called does not meet this specification and an
appropriate implementation is found on the system, then the
appropriate implementation will be used.</p>

<p>The release argument specifies either the exact version
string, or a list of version strings and ranges separated by
spaces. A version string is the developer designation of the
version number in the following form: 1.x.0_u (where x is
the major version number, and u is the update version
number). A version range is made up of a version string
followed by a plus sign (+) to designate this version or
later, or a part of a version string followed by an asterisk
(*) to designate any version string with a matching prefix.
Version strings and ranges can be combined using a space for
a logical OR combination, or an ampersand (&amp;) for a
logical AND combination of two version strings/ranges. For
example, if running the class or JAR file requires either
JRE 6u13 (1.6.0_13), or any JRE 6 starting from 6u10
(1.6.0_10), specify the following:</p>

<p>-version:&quot;1.6.0_13 1.6* &amp; 1.6.0_10+&quot;</p>

<p>Quotation marks are necessary only if there are spaces
in the release parameter.</p>

<p>For JAR files, the preference is to specify version
requirements in the JAR file manifest rather than on the
command line.</p>

<p>Non-Standard Options These options are general purpose
options that are specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual
Machine.</p>

<p>-X Displays help for all available -X options.</p>

<p>-Xbatch Disables background compilation. By default, the
JVM compiles the method as a background task, running the
method in interpreter mode until the background compilation
is finished. The -Xbatch flag disables background
compilation so that compilation of all methods proceeds as a
foreground task until completed.</p>

<p>This option is equivalent to
-XX:-BackgroundCompilation.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath:path Specifies a list of directories,
JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to
search for boot class files. These are used in place of the
boot class files included in the JDK.</p>

<p>Do not deploy applications that use this option to
override a class in rt.jar, because this violates the JRE
binary code license.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/a:path Specifies a list of directories,
JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to
append to the end of the default bootstrap class path.</p>

<p>Do not deploy applications that use this option to
override a class in rt.jar, because this violates the JRE
binary code license.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/p:path Specifies a list of directories,
JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to
prepend to the front of the default bootstrap class
path.</p>

<p>Do not deploy applications that use this option to
override a class in rt.jar, because this violates the JRE
binary code license.</p>

<p>-Xcheck:jni Performs additional checks for Java Native
Interface (JNI) functions. Specifically, it validates the
parameters passed to the JNI function and the runtime
environment data before processing the JNI request. Any
invalid data encountered indicates a problem in the native
code, and the JVM will terminate with an irrecoverable error
in such cases. Expect a performance degradation when this
option is used.</p>

<p>-Xcomp Forces compilation of methods on first
invocation. By default, the Client VM (-client) performs
1,000 interpreted method invocations and the Server VM
(-server) performs 10,000 interpreted method invocations to
gather information for efficient compilation. Specifying the
-Xcomp option disables interpreted method invocations to
increase compilation performance at the expense of
efficiency.</p>

<p>You can also change the number of interpreted method
invocations before compilation using the
-XX:CompileThreshold option.</p>

<p>-Xdebug Does nothing. Provided for backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>-Xdiag Shows additional diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>-Xfuture Enables strict class-file format checks that
enforce close conformance to the class-file format
specification. Developers are encouraged to use this flag
when developing new code because the stricter checks will
become the default in future releases.</p>

<p>-Xint Runs the application in interpreted-only mode.
Compilation to native code is disabled, and all bytecode is
executed by the interpreter. The performance benefits
offered by the just in time (JIT) compiler are not present
in this mode.</p>

<p>-Xinternalversion Displays more detailed JVM version
information than the -version option, and then exits.</p>

<p>-Xloggc:filename Sets the file to which verbose GC
events information should be redirected for logging. The
information written to this file is similar to the output of
-verbose:gc with the time elapsed since the first GC event
preceding each logged event. The -Xloggc option overrides
-verbose:gc if both are given with the same java
command.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>-Xloggc:garbage-collection.log</p>

<p>-Xmaxjitcodesize=size Specifies the maximum code cache
size (in bytes) for JIT-compiled code. Append the letter k
or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g
or G to indicate gigabytes. The default maximum code cache
size is 240 MB; if you disable tiered compilation with the
option -XX:-TieredCompilation, then the default size is 48
MB:</p>

<p>-Xmaxjitcodesize=240m</p>

<p>This option is equivalent to
-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize.</p>

<p>-Xmixed Executes all bytecode by the interpreter except
for hot methods, which are compiled to native code.</p>

<p>-Xmnsize Sets the initial and maximum size (in bytes) of
the heap for the young generation (nursery). Append the
letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate
megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes.</p>

<p>The young generation region of the heap is used for new
objects. GC is performed in this region more often than in
other regions. If the size for the young generation is too
small, then a lot of minor garbage collections will be
performed. If the size is too large, then only full garbage
collections will be performed, which can take a long time to
complete. Oracle recommends that you keep the size for the
young generation between a half and a quarter of the overall
heap size.</p>

<p>The following examples show how to set the initial and
maximum size of young generation to 256 MB using various
units:</p>

<p>-Xmn256m -Xmn262144k -Xmn268435456</p>

<p>Instead of the -Xmn option to set both the initial and
maximum size of the heap for the young generation, you can
use -XX:NewSize to set the initial size and -XX:MaxNewSize
to set the maximum size.</p>

<p>-Xmssize Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the heap.
This value must be a multiple of 1024 and greater than 1 MB.
Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to
indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes.</p>

<p>The following examples show how to set the size of
allocated memory to 6 MB using various units:</p>

<p>-Xms6291456 -Xms6144k -Xms6m</p>

<p>If you do not set this option, then the initial size
will be set as the sum of the sizes allocated for the old
generation and the young generation. The initial size of the
heap for the young generation can be set using the -Xmn
option or the -XX:NewSize option.</p>

<p>-Xmxsize Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of the
memory allocation pool in bytes. This value must be a
multiple of 1024 and greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k
or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g
or G to indicate gigabytes. The default value is chosen at
runtime based on system configuration. For server
deployments, -Xms and -Xmx are often set to the same value.
See the section &quot;Ergonomics&quot; in Java SE HotSpot
Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning Guide at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.</p>

<p>The following examples show how to set the maximum
allowed size of allocated memory to 80 MB using various
units:</p>

<p>-Xmx83886080 -Xmx81920k -Xmx80m</p>

<p>The -Xmx option is equivalent to -XX:MaxHeapSize.</p>

<p>-Xnoclassgc Disables garbage collection (GC) of classes.
This can save some GC time, which shortens interruptions
during the application run.</p>

<p>When you specify -Xnoclassgc at startup, the class
objects in the application will be left untouched during GC
and will always be considered live. This can result in more
memory being permanently occupied which, if not used
carefully, will throw an out of memory exception.</p>

<p>-Xprof Profiles the running program and sends profiling
data to standard output. This option is provided as a
utility that is useful in program development and is not
intended to be used in production systems.</p>

<p>-Xrs Reduces the use of operating system signals by the
JVM.</p>

<p>Shutdown hooks enable orderly shutdown of a Java
application by running user cleanup code (such as closing
database connections) at shutdown, even if the JVM
terminates abruptly.</p>

<p>The JVM catches signals to implement shutdown hooks for
unexpected termination. The JVM uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and
SIGTERM to initiate the running of shutdown hooks.</p>

<p>The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the
feature of dumping thread stacks for debugging purposes. The
JVM uses SIGQUIT to perform thread dumps.</p>

<p>Applications embedding the JVM frequently need to trap
signals such as SIGINT or SIGTERM, which can lead to
interference with the JVM signal handlers. The -Xrs option
is available to address this issue. When -Xrs is used, the
signal masks for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are
not changed by the JVM, and signal handlers for these
signals are not installed.</p>

<p>There are two consequences of specifying -Xrs:</p>

<p>&middot; SIGQUIT thread dumps are not available.</p>

<p>&middot; User code is responsible for causing shutdown
hooks to run, for example, by calling System.exit() when the
JVM is to be terminated.</p>

<p>-Xshare:mode Sets the class data sharing (CDS) mode.
Possible mode arguments for this option include the
following:</p>

<p>auto Use CDS if possible. This is the default value for
Java HotSpot 32-Bit Client VM.</p>

<p>on Require the use of CDS. Print an error message and
exit if class data sharing cannot be used.</p>

<p>off Do not use CDS. This is the default value for Java
HotSpot 32-Bit Server VM, Java HotSpot 64-Bit Client VM, and
Java HotSpot 64-Bit Server VM.</p>

<p>dump Manually generate the CDS archive. Specify the
application class path as described in &quot;Setting the
Class Path &quot;.</p>

<p>You should regenerate the CDS archive with each new JDK
release.</p>

<p>-XshowSettings:category Shows settings and continues.
Possible category arguments for this option include the
following:</p>

<p>all Shows all categories of settings. This is the
default value.</p>

<p>locale Shows settings related to locale.</p>

<p>properties Shows settings related to system
properties.</p>

<p>vm Shows the settings of the JVM.</p>

<p>-Xsssize Sets the thread stack size (in bytes). Append
the letter k or K to indicate KB, m or M to indicate MB, g
or G to indicate GB. The default value depends on the
platform:</p>

<p>&middot; Linux/ARM (32-bit): 320 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Linux/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Linux/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB</p>

<p>&middot; OS X (64-bit): 1024 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Oracle Solaris/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Oracle Solaris/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB</p>

<p>The following examples set the thread stack size to 1024
KB in different units:</p>

<p>-Xss1m -Xss1024k -Xss1048576</p>

<p>This option is equivalent to -XX:ThreadStackSize.</p>

<p>-Xusealtsigs Use alternative signals instead of SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 for JVM internal signals. This option is
equivalent to -XX:+UseAltSigs.</p>

<p>-Xverify:mode Sets the mode of the bytecode verifier.
Bytecode verification helps to troubleshoot some problems,
but it also adds overhead to the running application.
Possible mode arguments for this option include the
following:</p>

<p>none Do not verify the bytecode. This reduces startup
time and also reduces the protection provided by Java.</p>

<p>remote Verify those classes that are not loaded by the
bootstrap class loader. This is the default behavior if you
do not specify the -Xverify option.</p>

<p>all Verify all classes.</p>

<p>Advanced Runtime Options These options control the
runtime behavior of the Java HotSpot VM.</p>

<p>-XX:+CheckEndorsedAndExtDirs Enables the option to
prevent the java command from running a Java application if
it uses the endorsed-standards override mechanism or the
extension mechanism. This option checks if an application is
using one of these mechanisms by checking the following:</p>

<p>&middot; The java.ext.dirs or java.endorsed.dirs system
property is set.</p>

<p>&middot; The lib/endorsed directory exists and is not
empty.</p>

<p>&middot; The lib/ext directory contains any JAR files
other than those of the JDK.</p>

<p>&middot; The system-wide platform-specific extension
directory contains any JAR files.</p>

<p>-XX:+DisableAttachMechanism Enables the option that
disables the mechanism that lets tools attach to the JVM. By
default, this option is disabled, meaning that the attach
mechanism is enabled and you can use tools such as jcmd,
jstack, jmap, and jinfo.</p>

<p>-XX:ErrorFile=filename Specifies the path and file name
to which error data is written when an irrecoverable error
occurs. By default, this file is created in the current
working directory and named hs_err_pidpid.log where pid is
the identifier of the process that caused the error. The
following example shows how to set the default log file
(note that the identifier of the process is specified as
%p):</p>

<p>-XX:ErrorFile=./hs_err_pid%p.log</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the error log to
/var/log/java/java_error.log:</p>

<p>-XX:ErrorFile=/var/log/java/java_error.log</p>

<p>If the file cannot be created in the specified directory
(due to insufficient space, permission problem, or another
issue), then the file is created in the temporary directory
for the operating system. The temporary directory is
/tmp.</p>

<p>-XX:+FailOverToOldVerifier Enables automatic failover to
the old verifier when the new type checker fails. By
default, this option is disabled and it is ignored (that is,
treated as disabled) for classes with a recent bytecode
version. You can enable it for classes with older versions
of the bytecode.</p>

<p>-XX:LargePageSizeInBytes=size On Solaris, sets the
maximum size (in bytes) for large pages used for Java heap.
The size argument must be a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...).
Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to
indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By
default, the size is set to 0, meaning that the JVM chooses
the size for large pages automatically.</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to set the large
page size to 4 megabytes (MB):</p>

<p>-XX:LargePageSizeInBytes=4m</p>

<p>-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=size Sets the maximum total size
(in bytes) of the New I/O (the java.nio package)
direct-buffer allocations. Append the letter k or K to
indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to
indicate gigabytes. By default, the size is set to 0,
meaning that the JVM chooses the size for NIO direct-buffer
allocations automatically.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate how to set the NIO
size to 1024 KB in different units:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1024k
-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1048576</p>

<p>-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=mode Specifies the mode for
tracking JVM native memory usage. Possible mode arguments
for this option include the following:</p>

<p>off Do not track JVM native memory usage. This is the
default behavior if you do not specify the
-XX:NativeMemoryTracking option.</p>

<p>summary Only track memory usage by JVM subsystems, such
as Java heap, class, code, and thread.</p>

<p>detail In addition to tracking memory usage by JVM
subsystems, track memory usage by individual CallSite,
individual virtual memory region and its committed
regions.</p>

<p>-XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes=alignment Sets the memory
alignment of Java objects (in bytes). By default, the value
is set to 8 bytes. The specified value should be a power of
two, and must be within the range of 8 and 256 (inclusive).
This option makes it possible to use compressed pointers
with large Java heap sizes.</p>

<p>The heap size limit in bytes is calculated as:</p>

<p>4GB * ObjectAlignmentInBytes</p>

<p>Note: As the alignment value increases, the unused space
between objects will also increase. As a result, you may not
realize any benefits from using compressed pointers with
large Java heap sizes.</p>

<p>-XX:OnError=string Sets a custom command or a series of
semicolon-separated commands to run when an irrecoverable
error occurs. If the string contains spaces, then it must be
enclosed in quotation marks.</p>

<p>The following example shows how the -XX:OnError option
can be used to run the gcore command to create the core
image, and the debugger is started to attach to the process
in case of an irrecoverable error (the %p designates the
current process):</p>

<p>-XX:OnError=&quot;gcore %p;dbx - %p&quot;</p>

<p>-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=string Sets a custom command or a
series of semicolon-separated commands to run when an
OutOfMemoryError exception is first thrown. If the string
contains spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation
marks. For an example of a command string, see the
description of the -XX:OnError option.</p>

<p>-XX:+PerfDataSaveToFile If enabled, saves jstat(1)
binary data when the Java application exits. This binary
data is saved in a file named hsperfdata_&lt;pid&gt;, where
&lt;pid&gt; is the process identifier of the Java
application you ran. Use jstat to display the performance
data contained in this file as follows:</p>

<p>jstat -class file:///&lt;path&gt;/hsperfdata_&lt;pid&gt;
jstat -gc file:///&lt;path&gt;/hsperfdata_&lt;pid&gt;</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags Enables printing of
ergonomically selected JVM flags that appeared on the
command line. It can be useful to know the ergonomic values
set by the JVM, such as the heap space size and the selected
garbage collector. By default, this option is disabled and
flags are not printed.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintNMTStatistics Enables printing of collected
native memory tracking data at JVM exit when native memory
tracking is enabled (see -XX:NativeMemoryTracking). By
default, this option is disabled and native memory tracking
data is not printed.</p>

<p>-XX:+RelaxAccessControlCheck Decreases the amount of
access control checks in the verifier. By default, this
option is disabled, and it is ignored (that is, treated as
disabled) for classes with a recent bytecode version. You
can enable it for classes with older versions of the
bytecode.</p>

<p>-XX:+ShowMessageBoxOnError Enables displaying of a
dialog box when the JVM experiences an irrecoverable error.
This prevents the JVM from exiting and keeps the process
active so that you can attach a debugger to it to
investigate the cause of the error. By default, this option
is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:ThreadStackSize=size Sets the thread stack size (in
bytes). Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or
M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The
default value depends on the platform:</p>

<p>&middot; Linux/ARM (32-bit): 320 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Linux/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Linux/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB</p>

<p>&middot; OS X (64-bit): 1024 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Oracle Solaris/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB</p>

<p>&middot; Oracle Solaris/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB</p>

<p>The following examples show how to set the thread stack
size to 1024 KB in different units:</p>

<p>-XX:ThreadStackSize=1m -XX:ThreadStackSize=1024k
-XX:ThreadStackSize=1048576</p>

<p>This option is equivalent to -Xss.</p>

<p>-XX:+TraceClassLoading Enables tracing of classes as
they are loaded. By default, this option is disabled and
classes are not traced.</p>

<p>-XX:+TraceClassLoadingPreorder Enables tracing of all
loaded classes in the order in which they are referenced. By
default, this option is disabled and classes are not
traced.</p>

<p>-XX:+TraceClassResolution Enables tracing of constant
pool resolutions. By default, this option is disabled and
constant pool resolutions are not traced.</p>

<p>-XX:+TraceClassUnloading Enables tracing of classes as
they are unloaded. By default, this option is disabled and
classes are not traced.</p>

<p>-XX:+TraceLoaderConstraints Enables tracing of the
loader constraints recording. By default, this option is
disabled and loader constraints recording is not traced.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAltSigs Enables the use of alternative signals
instead of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 for JVM internal signals. By
default, this option is disabled and alternative signals are
not used. This option is equivalent to -Xusealtsigs.</p>

<p>-XX:-UseBiasedLocking Disables the use of biased
locking. Some applications with significant amounts of
uncontended synchronization may attain significant speedups
with this flag enabled, whereas applications with certain
patterns of locking may see slowdowns. For more information
about the biased locking technique, see the example in Java
Tuning White Paper at
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/tuning-139912.html#section4.2.5</p>

<p>By default, this option is enabled.</p>

<p>-XX:-UseCompressedOops Disables the use of compressed
pointers. By default, this option is enabled, and compressed
pointers are used when Java heap sizes are less than 32 GB.
When this option is enabled, object references are
represented as 32-bit offsets instead of 64-bit pointers,
which typically increases performance when running the
application with Java heap sizes less than 32 GB. This
option works only for 64-bit JVMs.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use compressed pointers when Java
heap sizes are greater than 32GB. See the
-XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes option.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseHugeTLBFS This option for Linux is the
equivalent of specifying -XX:+UseLargePages. This option is
disabled by default. This option pre-allocates all large
pages up-front, when memory is reserved; consequently the
JVM cannot dynamically grow or shrink large pages memory
areas; see -XX:UseTransparentHugePages if you want this
behavior.</p>

<p>For more information, see &quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseLargePages Enables the use of large page memory.
By default, this option is disabled and large page memory is
not used.</p>

<p>For more information, see &quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseMembar Enables issuing of membars on thread
state transitions. This option is disabled by default on all
platforms except ARM servers, where it is enabled. (It is
recommended that you do not disable this option on ARM
servers.)</p>

<p>-XX:+UsePerfData Enables the perfdata feature. This
option is enabled by default to allow JVM monitoring and
performance testing. Disabling it suppresses the creation of
the hsperfdata_userid directories. To disable the perfdata
feature, specify -XX:-UsePerfData.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages On Linux, enables the use
of large pages that can dynamically grow or shrink. This
option is disabled by default. You may encounter performance
problems with transparent huge pages as the OS moves other
pages around to create huge pages; this option is made
available for experimentation.</p>

<p>For more information, see &quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p>-XX:+AllowUserSignalHandlers Enables installation of
signal handlers by the application. By default, this option
is disabled and the application is not allowed to install
signal handlers.</p>

<p>Advanced JIT Compiler Options These options control the
dynamic just-in-time (JIT) compilation performed by the Java
HotSpot VM.</p>

<p>-XX:+AggressiveOpts Enables the use of aggressive
performance optimization features, which are expected to
become default in upcoming releases. By default, this option
is disabled and experimental performance features are not
used.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocateInstancePrefetchLines=lines Sets the number
of lines to prefetch ahead of the instance allocation
pointer. By default, the number of lines to prefetch is set
to 1:</p>

<p>-XX:AllocateInstancePrefetchLines=1</p>

<p>Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this
option.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchDistance=size Sets the size (in
bytes) of the prefetch distance for object allocation.
Memory about to be written with the value of new objects is
prefetched up to this distance starting from the address of
the last allocated object. Each Java thread has its own
allocation point.</p>

<p>Negative values denote that prefetch distance is chosen
based on the platform. Positive values are bytes to
prefetch. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m
or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes.
The default value is set to -1.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the prefetch
distance to 1024 bytes:</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchDistance=1024</p>

<p>Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this
option.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchInstr=instruction Sets the prefetch
instruction to prefetch ahead of the allocation pointer.
Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.
Possible values are from 0 to 3. The actual instructions
behind the values depend on the platform. By default, the
prefetch instruction is set to 0:</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchInstr=0</p>

<p>Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this
option.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchLines=lines Sets the number of cache
lines to load after the last object allocation by using the
prefetch instructions generated in compiled code. The
default value is 1 if the last allocated object was an
instance, and 3 if it was an array.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the number of
loaded cache lines to 5:</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchLines=5</p>

<p>Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this
option.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchStepSize=size Sets the step size (in
bytes) for sequential prefetch instructions. Append the
letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate
megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the
step size is set to 16 bytes:</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchStepSize=16</p>

<p>Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this
option.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocatePrefetchStyle=style Sets the generated code
style for prefetch instructions. The style argument is an
integer from 0 to 3:</p>

<p>0 Do not generate prefetch instructions.</p>

<p>1 Execute prefetch instructions after each allocation.
This is the default parameter.</p>

<p>2 Use the thread-local allocation block (TLAB) watermark
pointer to determine when prefetch instructions are
executed.</p>

<p>3 Use BIS instruction on SPARC for allocation
prefetch.</p>

<p>Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this
option.</p>

<p>-XX:+BackgroundCompilation Enables background
compilation. This option is enabled by default. To disable
background compilation, specify -XX:-BackgroundCompilation
(this is equivalent to specifying -Xbatch).</p>

<p>-XX:CICompilerCount=threads Sets the number of compiler
threads to use for compilation. By default, the number of
threads is set to 2 for the server JVM, to 1 for the client
JVM, and it scales to the number of cores if tiered
compilation is used. The following example shows how to set
the number of threads to 2:</p>

<p>-XX:CICompilerCount=2</p>

<p>-XX:CodeCacheMinimumFreeSpace=size Sets the minimum free
space (in bytes) required for compilation. Append the letter
k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes,
g or G to indicate gigabytes. When less than the minimum
free space remains, compiling stops. By default, this option
is set to 500 KB. The following example shows how to set the
minimum free space to 1024 MB:</p>

<p>-XX:CodeCacheMinimumFreeSpace=1024m</p>

<p>-XX:CompileCommand=command,method[,option] Specifies a
command to perform on a method. For example, to exclude the
indexOf() method of the String class from being compiled,
use the following:</p>

<p>-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java/lang/String.indexOf</p>

<p>Note that the full class name is specified, including
all packages and subpackages separated by a slash (/). For
easier cut and paste operations, it is also possible to use
the method name format produced by the -XX:+PrintCompilation
and -XX:+LogCompilation options:</p>


<p>-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java.lang.String::indexOf</p>

<p>If the method is specified without the signature, the
command will be applied to all methods with the specified
name. However, you can also specify the signature of the
method in the class file format. In this case, you should
enclose the arguments in quotation marks, because otherwise
the shell treats the semicolon as command end. For example,
if you want to exclude only the indexOf(String) method of
the String class from being compiled, use the following:</p>


<p>-XX:CompileCommand=&quot;exclude,java/lang/String.indexOf,(Ljava/lang/String;)I&quot;</p>

<p>You can also use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard for
class and method names. For example, to exclude all
indexOf() methods in all classes from being compiled, use
the following:</p>

<p>-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,*.indexOf</p>

<p>The commas and periods are aliases for spaces, making it
easier to pass compiler commands through a shell. You can
pass arguments to -XX:CompileCommand using spaces as
separators by enclosing the argument in quotation marks:</p>

<p>-XX:CompileCommand=&quot;exclude java/lang/String
indexOf&quot;</p>

<p>Note that after parsing the commands passed on the
command line using the -XX:CompileCommand options, the JIT
compiler then reads commands from the .hotspot_compiler
file. You can add commands to this file or specify a
different file using the -XX:CompileCommandFile option.</p>

<p>To add several commands, either specify the
-XX:CompileCommand option multiple times, or separate each
argument with the newline separator n). The following
commands are available:</p>

<p>break Set a breakpoint when debugging the JVM to stop at
the beginning of compilation of the specified method.</p>

<p>compileonly Exclude all methods from compilation except
for the specified method. As an alternative, you can use the
-XX:CompileOnly option, which allows to specify several
methods.</p>

<p>dontinline Prevent inlining of the specified method.</p>

<p>exclude Exclude the specified method from
compilation.</p>

<p>help Print a help message for the -XX:CompileCommand
option.</p>

<p>inline Attempt to inline the specified method.</p>

<p>log Exclude compilation logging (with the
-XX:+LogCompilation option) for all methods except for the
specified method. By default, logging is performed for all
compiled methods.</p>

<p>option This command can be used to pass a JIT
compilation option to the specified method in place of the
last argument (option). The compilation option is set at the
end, after the method name. For example, to enable the
BlockLayoutByFrequency option for the append() method of the
StringBuffer class, use the following:</p>


<p>-XX:CompileCommand=option,java/lang/StringBuffer.append,BlockLayoutByFrequency</p>

<p>You can specify multiple compilation options, separated
by commas or spaces.</p>

<p>print Print generated assembler code after compilation
of the specified method.</p>

<p>quiet Do not print the compile commands. By default, the
commands that you specify with the -XX:CompileCommand option
are printed; for example, if you exclude from compilation
the indexOf() method of the String class, then the following
will be printed to standard output:</p>

<p>CompilerOracle: exclude java/lang/String.indexOf</p>

<p>You can suppress this by specifying the
-XX:CompileCommand=quiet option before other
-XX:CompileCommand options.</p>

<p>-XX:CompileCommandFile=filename Sets the file from which
JIT compiler commands are read. By default, the
.hotspot_compiler file is used to store commands performed
by the JIT compiler.</p>

<p>Each line in the command file represents a command, a
class name, and a method name for which the command is used.
For example, this line prints assembly code for the
toString() method of the String class:</p>

<p>print java/lang/String toString</p>

<p>For more information about specifying the commands for
the JIT compiler to perform on methods, see the
-XX:CompileCommand option.</p>

<p>-XX:CompileOnly=methods Sets the list of methods
(separated by commas) to which compilation should be
restricted. Only the specified methods will be compiled.
Specify each method with the full class name (including the
packages and subpackages). For example, to compile only the
length() method of the String class and the size() method of
the List class, use the following:</p>


<p>-XX:CompileOnly=java/lang/String.length,java/util/List.size</p>

<p>Note that the full class name is specified, including
all packages and subpackages separated by a slash (/). For
easier cut and paste operations, it is also possible to use
the method name format produced by the -XX:+PrintCompilation
and -XX:+LogCompilation options:</p>


<p>-XX:CompileOnly=java.lang.String::length,java.util.List::size</p>

<p>Although wildcards are not supported, you can specify
only the class or package name to compile all methods in
that class or package, as well as specify just the method to
compile methods with this name in any class:</p>

<p>-XX:CompileOnly=java/lang/String
-XX:CompileOnly=java/lang -XX:CompileOnly=.length</p>

<p>-XX:CompileThreshold=invocations Sets the number of
interpreted method invocations before compilation. By
default, in the server JVM, the JIT compiler performs 10,000
interpreted method invocations to gather information for
efficient compilation. For the client JVM, the default
setting is 1,500 invocations. This option is ignored when
tiered compilation is enabled; see the option
-XX:+TieredCompilation. The following example shows how to
set the number of interpreted method invocations to
5,000:</p>

<p>-XX:CompileThreshold=5000</p>

<p>You can completely disable interpretation of Java
methods before compilation by specifying the -Xcomp
option.</p>

<p>-XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis Enables the use of escape
analysis. This option is enabled by default. To disable the
use of escape analysis, specify -XX:-DoEscapeAnalysis. Only
the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.</p>

<p>-XX:InitialCodeCacheSize=size Sets the initial code
cache size (in bytes). Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate
gigabytes. The default value is set to 500 KB. The initial
code cache size should be not less than the system&rsquo;s
minimal memory page size. The following example shows how to
set the initial code cache size to 32 KB:</p>

<p>-XX:InitialCodeCacheSize=32k</p>

<p>-XX:+Inline Enables method inlining. This option is
enabled by default to increase performance. To disable
method inlining, specify -XX:-Inline.</p>

<p>-XX:InlineSmallCode=size Sets the maximum code size (in
bytes) for compiled methods that should be inlined. Append
the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate
megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. Only compiled
methods with the size smaller than the specified size will
be inlined. By default, the maximum code size is set to 1000
bytes:</p>

<p>-XX:InlineSmallCode=1000</p>

<p>-XX:+LogCompilation Enables logging of compilation
activity to a file named hotspot.log in the current working
directory. You can specify a different log file path and
name using the -XX:LogFile option.</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled and compilation
activity is not logged. The -XX:+LogCompilation option has
to be used together with the -XX:UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
option that unlocks diagnostic JVM options.</p>

<p>You can enable verbose diagnostic output with a message
printed to the console every time a method is compiled by
using the -XX:+PrintCompilation option.</p>

<p>-XX:MaxInlineSize=size Sets the maximum bytecode size
(in bytes) of a method to be inlined. Append the letter k or
K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or
G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the maximum bytecode
size is set to 35 bytes:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxInlineSize=35</p>

<p>-XX:MaxNodeLimit=nodes Sets the maximum number of nodes
to be used during single method compilation. By default, the
maximum number of nodes is set to 65,000:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxNodeLimit=65000</p>

<p>-XX:MaxTrivialSize=size Sets the maximum bytecode size
(in bytes) of a trivial method to be inlined. Append the
letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate
megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the
maximum bytecode size of a trivial method is set to 6
bytes:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxTrivialSize=6</p>

<p>-XX:+OptimizeStringConcat Enables the optimization of
String concatenation operations. This option is enabled by
default. To disable the optimization of String concatenation
operations, specify -XX:-OptimizeStringConcat. Only the Java
HotSpot Server VM supports this option.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintAssembly Enables printing of assembly code for
bytecoded and native methods by using the external
disassembler.so library. This enables you to see the
generated code, which may help you to diagnose performance
issues.</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled and assembly code is
not printed. The -XX:+PrintAssembly option has to be used
together with the -XX:UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions option that
unlocks diagnostic JVM options.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintCompilation Enables verbose diagnostic output
from the JVM by printing a message to the console every time
a method is compiled. This enables you to see which methods
actually get compiled. By default, this option is disabled
and diagnostic output is not printed.</p>

<p>You can also log compilation activity to a file by using
the -XX:+LogCompilation option.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintInlining Enables printing of inlining
decisions. This enables you to see which methods are getting
inlined.</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled and inlining
information is not printed. The -XX:+PrintInlining option
has to be used together with the
-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions option that unlocks
diagnostic JVM options.</p>

<p>-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=size Sets the maximum code
cache size (in bytes) for JIT-compiled code. Append the
letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate
megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The default maximum
code cache size is 240 MB; if you disable tiered compilation
with the option -XX:-TieredCompilation, then the default
size is 48 MB. This option has a limit of 2 GB; otherwise,
an error is generated. The maximum code cache size should
not be less than the initial code cache size; see the option
-XX:InitialCodeCacheSize. This option is equivalent to
-Xmaxjitcodesize.</p>

<p>-XX:RTMAbortRatio=abort_ratio The RTM abort ratio is
specified as a percentage (%) of all executed RTM
transactions. If a number of aborted transactions becomes
greater than this ratio, then the compiled code will be
deoptimized. This ratio is used when the -XX:+UseRTMDeopt
option is enabled. The default value of this option is 50.
This means that the compiled code will be deoptimized if 50%
of all transactions are aborted.</p>

<p>-XX:RTMRetryCount=number_of_retries RTM locking code
will be retried, when it is aborted or busy, the number of
times specified by this option before falling back to the
normal locking mechanism. The default value for this option
is 5. The -XX:UseRTMLocking option must be enabled.</p>

<p>-XX:-TieredCompilation Disables the use of tiered
compilation. By default, this option is enabled. Only the
Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAES Enables hardware-based AES intrinsics for
Intel, AMD, and SPARC hardware. Intel Westmere (2010 and
newer), AMD Bulldozer (2011 and newer), and SPARC (T4 and
newer) are the supported hardware. UseAES is used in
conjunction with UseAESIntrinsics.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAESIntrinsics UseAES and UseAESIntrinsics flags
are enabled by default and are supported only for Java
HotSpot Server VM 32-bit and 64-bit. To disable
hardware-based AES intrinsics, specify -XX:-UseAES
-XX:-UseAESIntrinsics. For example, to enable hardware AES,
use the following flags:</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAES -XX:+UseAESIntrinsics</p>

<p>To support UseAES and UseAESIntrinsics flags for 32-bit
and 64-bit use -server option to choose Java HotSpot Server
VM. These flags are not supported on Client VM.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseCodeCacheFlushing Enables flushing of the code
cache before shutting down the compiler. This option is
enabled by default. To disable flushing of the code cache
before shutting down the compiler, specify
-XX:-UseCodeCacheFlushing.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseCondCardMark Enables checking of whether the
card is already marked before updating the card table. This
option is disabled by default and should only be used on
machines with multiple sockets, where it will increase
performance of Java applications that rely heavily on
concurrent operations. Only the Java HotSpot Server VM
supports this option.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseRTMDeopt Auto-tunes RTM locking depending on the
abort ratio. This ratio is specified by -XX:RTMAbortRatio
option. If the number of aborted transactions exceeds the
abort ratio, then the method containing the lock will be
deoptimized and recompiled with all locks as normal locks.
This option is disabled by default. The -XX:+UseRTMLocking
option must be enabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseRTMLocking Generate Restricted Transactional
Memory (RTM) locking code for all inflated locks, with the
normal locking mechanism as the fallback handler. This
option is disabled by default. Options related to RTM are
only available for the Java HotSpot Server VM on x86 CPUs
that support Transactional Synchronization Extensions
(TSX).</p>

<p>RTM is part of Intel&rsquo;s TSX, which is an x86
instruction set extension and facilitates the creation of
multithreaded applications. RTM introduces the new
instructions XBEGIN, XABORT, XEND, and XTEST. The XBEGIN and
XEND instructions enclose a set of instructions to run as a
transaction. If no conflict is found when running the
transaction, the memory and register modifications are
committed together at the XEND instruction. The XABORT
instruction can be used to explicitly abort a transaction
and the XEND instruction to check if a set of instructions
are being run in a transaction.</p>

<p>A lock on a transaction is inflated when another thread
tries to access the same transaction, thereby blocking the
thread that did not originally request access to the
transaction. RTM requires that a fallback set of operations
be specified in case a transaction aborts or fails. An RTM
lock is a lock that has been delegated to the TSX&rsquo;s
system.</p>

<p>RTM improves performance for highly contended locks with
low conflict in a critical region (which is code that must
not be accessed by more than one thread concurrently). RTM
also improves the performance of coarse-grain locking, which
typically does not perform well in multithreaded
applications. (Coarse-grain locking is the strategy of
holding locks for long periods to minimize the overhead of
taking and releasing locks, while fine-grained locking is
the strategy of trying to achieve maximum parallelism by
locking only when necessary and unlocking as soon as
possible.) Also, for lightly contended locks that are used
by different threads, RTM can reduce false cache line
sharing, also known as cache line ping-pong. This occurs
when multiple threads from different processors are
accessing different resources, but the resources share the
same cache line. As a result, the processors repeatedly
invalidate the cache lines of other processors, which forces
them to read from main memory instead of their cache.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSHA Enables hardware-based intrinsics for SHA
crypto hash functions for SPARC hardware. UseSHA is used in
conjunction with the UseSHA1Intrinsics, UseSHA256Intrinsics,
and UseSHA512Intrinsics options.</p>

<p>The UseSHA and UseSHA*Intrinsics flags are enabled by
default, and are supported only for Java HotSpot Server VM
64-bit on SPARC T4 and newer.</p>

<p>This feature is only applicable when using the
sun.security.provider.Sun provider for SHA operations.</p>

<p>To disable all hardware-based SHA intrinsics, specify
-XX:-UseSHA. To disable only a particular SHA intrinsic, use
the appropriate corresponding option. For example:
-XX:-UseSHA256Intrinsics.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSHA1Intrinsics Enables intrinsics for SHA-1
crypto hash function.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSHA256Intrinsics Enables intrinsics for SHA-224
and SHA-256 crypto hash functions.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSHA512Intrinsics Enables intrinsics for SHA-384
and SHA-512 crypto hash functions.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSuperWord Enables the transformation of scalar
operations into superword operations. This option is enabled
by default. To disable the transformation of scalar
operations into superword operations, specify
-XX:-UseSuperWord. Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports
this option.</p>

<p>Advanced Serviceability Options These options provide
the ability to gather system information and perform
extensive debugging.</p>

<p>-XX:+ExtendedDTraceProbes Enables additional dtrace tool
probes that impact the performance. By default, this option
is disabled and dtrace performs only standard probes.</p>

<p>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemory Enables the dumping of the
Java heap to a file in the current directory by using the
heap profiler (HPROF) when a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
exception is thrown. You can explicitly set the heap dump
file path and name using the -XX:HeapDumpPath option. By
default, this option is disabled and the heap is not dumped
when an OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown.</p>

<p>-XX:HeapDumpPath=path Sets the path and file name for
writing the heap dump provided by the heap profiler (HPROF)
when the -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError option is set. By
default, the file is created in the current working
directory, and it is named java_pidpid.hprof where pid is
the identifier of the process that caused the error. The
following example shows how to set the default file
explicitly (%p represents the current process
identificator):</p>

<p>-XX:HeapDumpPath=./java_pid%p.hprof</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the heap dump
file to /var/log/java/java_heapdump.hprof:</p>

<p>-XX:HeapDumpPath=/var/log/java/java_heapdump.hprof</p>

<p>-XX:LogFile=path Sets the path and file name where log
data is written. By default, the file is created in the
current working directory, and it is named hotspot.log.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the log file to
/var/log/java/hotspot.log:</p>

<p>-XX:LogFile=/var/log/java/hotspot.log</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintClassHistogram Enables printing of a class
instance histogram after a Control+C event (SIGTERM). By
default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>Setting this option is equivalent to running the jmap
-histo command, or the jcmd pid GC.class_histogram command,
where pid is the current Java process identifier.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintConcurrentLocks Enables printing of locks
after a event. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>Enables printing of java.util.concurrent locks after a
Control+C event (SIGTERM). By default, this option is
disabled.</p>

<p>Setting this option is equivalent to running the jstack
-l command or the jcmd pid Thread.print -l command, where
pid is the current Java process identifier.</p>

<p>-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions Unlocks the options
intended for diagnosing the JVM. By default, this option is
disabled and diagnostic options are not available.</p>

<p>Advanced Garbage Collection Options These options
control how garbage collection (GC) is performed by the Java
HotSpot VM.</p>

<p>-XX:+AggressiveHeap Enables Java heap optimization. This
sets various parameters to be optimal for long-running jobs
with intensive memory allocation, based on the configuration
of the computer (RAM and CPU). By default, the option is
disabled and the heap is not optimized.</p>

<p>-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch Enables touching of every page on
the Java heap during JVM initialization. This gets all pages
into the memory before entering the main() method. The
option can be used in testing to simulate a long-running
system with all virtual memory mapped to physical memory. By
default, this option is disabled and all pages are committed
as JVM heap space fills.</p>

<p>-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled Enables class unloading
when using the concurrent mark-sweep (CMS) garbage
collector. This option is enabled by default. To disable
class unloading for the CMS garbage collector, specify
-XX:-CMSClassUnloadingEnabled.</p>

<p>-XX:CMSExpAvgFactor=percent Sets the percentage of time
(0 to 100) used to weight the current sample when computing
exponential averages for the concurrent collection
statistics. By default, the exponential averages factor is
set to 25%. The following example shows how to set the
factor to 15%:</p>

<p>-XX:CMSExpAvgFactor=15</p>

<p>-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=percent Sets the
percentage of the old generation occupancy (0 to 100) at
which to start a CMS collection cycle. The default value is
set to -1. Any negative value (including the default)
implies that -XX:CMSTriggerRatio is used to define the value
of the initiating occupancy fraction.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the occupancy
fraction to 20%:</p>

<p>-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=20</p>

<p>-XX:+CMSScavengeBeforeRemark Enables scavenging attempts
before the CMS remark step. By default, this option is
disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:CMSTriggerRatio=percent Sets the percentage (0 to
100) of the value specified by -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio that is
allocated before a CMS collection cycle commences. The
default value is set to 80%.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the occupancy
fraction to 75%:</p>

<p>-XX:CMSTriggerRatio=75</p>

<p>-XX:ConcGCThreads=threads Sets the number of threads
used for concurrent GC. The default value depends on the
number of CPUs available to the JVM.</p>

<p>For example, to set the number of threads for concurrent
GC to 2, specify the following option:</p>

<p>-XX:ConcGCThreads=2</p>

<p>-XX:+DisableExplicitGC Enables the option that disables
processing of calls to System.gc(). This option is disabled
by default, meaning that calls to System.gc() are processed.
If processing of calls to System.gc() is disabled, the JVM
still performs GC when necessary.</p>

<p>-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent Enables invoking of
concurrent GC by using the System.gc() request. This option
is disabled by default and can be enabled only together with
the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option.</p>

<p>-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrentAndUnloadsClasses
Enables invoking of concurrent GC by using the System.gc()
request and unloading of classes during the concurrent GC
cycle. This option is disabled by default and can be enabled
only together with the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option.</p>

<p>-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=size Sets the size of the regions
into which the Java heap is subdivided when using the
garbage-first (G1) collector. The value can be between 1 MB
and 32 MB. The default region size is determined
ergonomically based on the heap size.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the size of the
subdivisions to 16 MB:</p>

<p>-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16m</p>

<p>-XX:+G1PrintHeapRegions Enables the printing of
information about which regions are allocated and which are
reclaimed by the G1 collector. By default, this option is
disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:G1ReservePercent=percent Sets the percentage of the
heap (0 to 50) that is reserved as a false ceiling to reduce
the possibility of promotion failure for the G1 collector.
By default, this option is set to 10%.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the reserved heap
to 20%:</p>

<p>-XX:G1ReservePercent=20</p>

<p>-XX:InitialHeapSize=size Sets the initial size (in
bytes) of the memory allocation pool. This value must be
either 0, or a multiple of 1024 and greater than 1 MB.
Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to
indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The
default value is chosen at runtime based on system
configuration. See the section &quot;Ergonomics&quot; in
Java SE HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning
Guide at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.</p>

<p>The following examples show how to set the size of
allocated memory to 6 MB using various units:</p>

<p>-XX:InitialHeapSize=6291456 -XX:InitialHeapSize=6144k
-XX:InitialHeapSize=6m</p>

<p>If you set this option to 0, then the initial size will
be set as the sum of the sizes allocated for the old
generation and the young generation. The size of the heap
for the young generation can be set using the -XX:NewSize
option.</p>

<p>-XX:InitialSurvivorRatio=ratio Sets the initial survivor
space ratio used by the throughput garbage collector (which
is enabled by the -XX:+UseParallelGC and/or
-XX:+UseParallelOldGC options). Adaptive sizing is enabled
by default with the throughput garbage collector by using
the -XX:+UseParallelGC and -XX:+UseParallelOldGC options,
and survivor space is resized according to the application
behavior, starting with the initial value. If adaptive
sizing is disabled (using the -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy
option), then the -XX:SurvivorRatio option should be used to
set the size of the survivor space for the entire execution
of the application.</p>

<p>The following formula can be used to calculate the
initial size of survivor space (S) based on the size of the
young generation (Y), and the initial survivor space ratio
(R):</p>

<p>S=Y/(R+2)</p>

<p>The 2 in the equation denotes two survivor spaces. The
larger the value specified as the initial survivor space
ratio, the smaller the initial survivor space size.</p>

<p>By default, the initial survivor space ratio is set to
8. If the default value for the young generation space size
is used (2 MB), the initial size of the survivor space will
be 0.2 MB.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the initial
survivor space ratio to 4:</p>

<p>-XX:InitialSurvivorRatio=4</p>

<p>-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=percent Sets the
percentage of the heap occupancy (0 to 100) at which to
start a concurrent GC cycle. It is used by garbage
collectors that trigger a concurrent GC cycle based on the
occupancy of the entire heap, not just one of the
generations (for example, the G1 garbage collector).</p>

<p>By default, the initiating value is set to 45%. A value
of 0 implies nonstop GC cycles. The following example shows
how to set the initiating heap occupancy to 75%:</p>

<p>-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=75</p>

<p>-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=time Sets a target for the maximum
GC pause time (in milliseconds). This is a soft goal, and
the JVM will make its best effort to achieve it. By default,
there is no maximum pause time value.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the maximum
target pause time to 500 ms:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500</p>

<p>-XX:MaxHeapSize=size Sets the maximum size (in byes) of
the memory allocation pool. This value must be a multiple of
1024 and greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k or K to
indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to
indicate gigabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime
based on system configuration. For server deployments,
-XX:InitialHeapSize and -XX:MaxHeapSize are often set to the
same value. See the section &quot;Ergonomics&quot; in Java
SE HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning Guide
at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.</p>

<p>The following examples show how to set the maximum
allowed size of allocated memory to 80 MB using various
units:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxHeapSize=83886080 -XX:MaxHeapSize=81920k
-XX:MaxHeapSize=80m</p>

<p>On Oracle Solaris 7 and Oracle Solaris 8 SPARC
platforms, the upper limit for this value is approximately
4,000 MB minus overhead amounts. On Oracle Solaris 2.6 and
x86 platforms, the upper limit is approximately 2,000 MB
minus overhead amounts. On Linux platforms, the upper limit
is approximately 2,000 MB minus overhead amounts.</p>

<p>The -XX:MaxHeapSize option is equivalent to -Xmx.</p>

<p>-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=percent Sets the maximum allowed
percentage of free heap space (0 to 100) after a GC event.
If free heap space expands above this value, then the heap
will be shrunk. By default, this value is set to 70%.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the maximum free
heap ratio to 75%:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=75</p>

<p>-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=size Sets the maximum amount of
native memory that can be allocated for class metadata. By
default, the size is not limited. The amount of metadata for
an application depends on the application itself, other
running applications, and the amount of memory available on
the system.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the maximum class
metadata size to 256 MB:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m</p>

<p>-XX:MaxNewSize=size Sets the maximum size (in bytes) of
the heap for the young generation (nursery). The default
value is set ergonomically.</p>

<p>-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=threshold Sets the maximum
tenuring threshold for use in adaptive GC sizing. The
largest value is 15. The default value is 15 for the
parallel (throughput) collector, and 6 for the CMS
collector.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the maximum
tenuring threshold to 10:</p>

<p>-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=10</p>

<p>-XX:MetaspaceSize=size Sets the size of the allocated
class metadata space that will trigger a garbage collection
the first time it is exceeded. This threshold for a garbage
collection is increased or decreased depending on the amount
of metadata used. The default size depends on the
platform.</p>

<p>-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=percent Sets the minimum allowed
percentage of free heap space (0 to 100) after a GC event.
If free heap space falls below this value, then the heap
will be expanded. By default, this value is set to 40%.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the minimum free
heap ratio to 25%:</p>

<p>-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=25</p>

<p>-XX:NewRatio=ratio Sets the ratio between young and old
generation sizes. By default, this option is set to 2. The
following example shows how to set the young/old ratio to
1:</p>

<p>-XX:NewRatio=1</p>

<p>-XX:NewSize=size Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the
heap for the young generation (nursery). Append the letter k
or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g
or G to indicate gigabytes.</p>

<p>The young generation region of the heap is used for new
objects. GC is performed in this region more often than in
other regions. If the size for the young generation is too
low, then a large number of minor GCs will be performed. If
the size is too high, then only full GCs will be performed,
which can take a long time to complete. Oracle recommends
that you keep the size for the young generation between a
half and a quarter of the overall heap size.</p>

<p>The following examples show how to set the initial size
of young generation to 256 MB using various units:</p>

<p>-XX:NewSize=256m -XX:NewSize=262144k
-XX:NewSize=268435456</p>

<p>The -XX:NewSize option is equivalent to -Xmn.</p>

<p>-XX:ParallelGCThreads=threads Sets the number of threads
used for parallel garbage collection in the young and old
generations. The default value depends on the number of CPUs
available to the JVM.</p>

<p>For example, to set the number of threads for parallel
GC to 2, specify the following option:</p>

<p>-XX:ParallelGCThreads=2</p>

<p>-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled Enables parallel reference
processing. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy Enables printing of
information about adaptive generation sizing. By default,
this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGC Enables printing of messages at every GC.
By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime Enables printing
of how much time elapsed since the last pause (for example,
a GC pause). By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime Enables printing of
how much time the pause (for example, a GC pause) lasted. By
default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps Enables printing of a date stamp
at every GC. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCDetails Enables printing of detailed
messages at every GC. By default, this option is
disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCTaskTimeStamps Enables printing of time
stamps for every individual GC worker thread task. By
default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps Enables printing of time stamps
at every GC. By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics Prints detailed
deduplication statistics. By default, this option is
disabled. See the -XX:+UseStringDeduplication option.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution Enables printing of
tenuring age information. The following is an example of the
output:</p>

<p>Desired survivor size 48286924 bytes, new threshold 10
(max 10) - age 1: 28992024 bytes, 28992024 total - age 2:
1366864 bytes, 30358888 total - age 3: 1425912 bytes,
31784800 total ...</p>

<p>Age 1 objects are the youngest survivors (they were
created after the previous scavenge, survived the latest
scavenge, and moved from eden to survivor space). Age 2
objects have survived two scavenges (during the second
scavenge they were copied from one survivor space to the
next). And so on.</p>

<p>In the preceding example, 28 992 024 bytes survived one
scavenge and were copied from eden to survivor space, 1 366
864 bytes are occupied by age 2 objects, etc. The third
value in each row is the cumulative size of objects of age n
or less.</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled.</p>

<p>-XX:+ScavengeBeforeFullGC Enables GC of the young
generation before each full GC. This option is enabled by
default. Oracle recommends that you do not disable it,
because scavenging the young generation before a full GC can
reduce the number of objects reachable from the old
generation space into the young generation space. To disable
GC of the young generation before each full GC, specify
-XX:-ScavengeBeforeFullGC.</p>

<p>-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=time Sets the amount of time
(in milliseconds) a softly reachable object is kept active
on the heap after the last time it was referenced. The
default value is one second of lifetime per free megabyte in
the heap. The -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB option accepts
integer values representing milliseconds per one megabyte of
the current heap size (for Java HotSpot Client VM) or the
maximum possible heap size (for Java HotSpot Server VM).
This difference means that the Client VM tends to flush soft
references rather than grow the heap, whereas the Server VM
tends to grow the heap rather than flush soft references. In
the latter case, the value of the -Xmx option has a
significant effect on how quickly soft references are
garbage collected.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the value to 2.5
seconds:</p>

<p>-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=2500</p>

<p>-XX:StringDeduplicationAgeThreshold=threshold String
objects reaching the specified age are considered candidates
for deduplication. An object&rsquo;s age is a measure of how
many times it has survived garbage collection. This is
sometimes referred to as tenuring; see the
-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution option. Note that String
objects that are promoted to an old heap region before this
age has been reached are always considered candidates for
deduplication. The default value for this option is 3. See
the -XX:+UseStringDeduplication option.</p>

<p>-XX:SurvivorRatio=ratio Sets the ratio between eden
space size and survivor space size. By default, this option
is set to 8. The following example shows how to set the
eden/survivor space ratio to 4:</p>

<p>-XX:SurvivorRatio=4</p>

<p>-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=percent Sets the desired
percentage of survivor space (0 to 100) used after young
garbage collection. By default, this option is set to
50%.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the target
survivor space ratio to 30%:</p>

<p>-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=30</p>

<p>-XX:TLABSize=size Sets the initial size (in bytes) of a
thread-local allocation buffer (TLAB). Append the letter k
or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g
or G to indicate gigabytes. If this option is set to 0, then
the JVM chooses the initial size automatically.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to set the initial TLAB
size to 512 KB:</p>

<p>-XX:TLABSize=512k</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy Enables the use of adaptive
generation sizing. This option is enabled by default. To
disable adaptive generation sizing, specify
-XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy and set the size of the memory
allocation pool explicitly (see the -XX:SurvivorRatio
option).</p>

<p>-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly Enables the use of
the occupancy value as the only criterion for initiating the
CMS collector. By default, this option is disabled and other
criteria may be used.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC Enables the use of the CMS
garbage collector for the old generation. Oracle recommends
that you use the CMS garbage collector when application
latency requirements cannot be met by the throughput
(-XX:+UseParallelGC) garbage collector. The G1 garbage
collector (-XX:+UseG1GC) is another alternative.</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled and the collector is
chosen automatically based on the configuration of the
machine and type of the JVM. When this option is enabled,
the -XX:+UseParNewGC option is automatically set and you
should not disable it, because the following combination of
options has been deprecated in JDK 8:
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:-UseParNewGC.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseG1GC Enables the use of the garbage-first (G1)
garbage collector. It is a server-style garbage collector,
targeted for multiprocessor machines with a large amount of
RAM. It meets GC pause time goals with high probability,
while maintaining good throughput. The G1 collector is
recommended for applications requiring large heaps (sizes of
around 6 GB or larger) with limited GC latency requirements
(stable and predictable pause time below 0.5 seconds).</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled and the collector is
chosen automatically based on the configuration of the
machine and type of the JVM.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit Enables the use of a policy that
limits the proportion of time spent by the JVM on GC before
an OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown. This option is
enabled, by default and the parallel GC will throw an
OutOfMemoryError if more than 98% of the total time is spent
on garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is
recovered. When the heap is small, this feature can be used
to prevent applications from running for long periods of
time with little or no progress. To disable this option,
specify -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseNUMA Enables performance optimization of an
application on a machine with nonuniform memory architecture
(NUMA) by increasing the application&rsquo;s use of lower
latency memory. By default, this option is disabled and no
optimization for NUMA is made. The option is only available
when the parallel garbage collector is used
(-XX:+UseParallelGC).</p>

<p>-XX:+UseParallelGC Enables the use of the parallel
scavenge garbage collector (also known as the throughput
collector) to improve the performance of your application by
leveraging multiple processors.</p>

<p>By default, this option is disabled and the collector is
chosen automatically based on the configuration of the
machine and type of the JVM. If it is enabled, then the
-XX:+UseParallelOldGC option is automatically enabled,
unless you explicitly disable it.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseParallelOldGC Enables the use of the parallel
garbage collector for full GCs. By default, this option is
disabled. Enabling it automatically enables the
-XX:+UseParallelGC option.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseParNewGC Enables the use of parallel threads for
collection in the young generation. By default, this option
is disabled. It is automatically enabled when you set the
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option. Using the -XX:+UseParNewGC
option without the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option was
deprecated in JDK 8.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSerialGC Enables the use of the serial garbage
collector. This is generally the best choice for small and
simple applications that do not require any special
functionality from garbage collection. By default, this
option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically
based on the configuration of the machine and type of the
JVM.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSHM On Linux, enables the JVM to use shared
memory to setup large pages.</p>

<p>For more information, see &quot;Large Pages&quot;.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseStringDeduplication Enables string
deduplication. By default, this option is disabled. To use
this option, you must enable the garbage-first (G1) garbage
collector. See the -XX:+UseG1GC option.</p>

<p>String deduplication reduces the memory footprint of
String objects on the Java heap by taking advantage of the
fact that many String objects are identical. Instead of each
String object pointing to its own character array, identical
String objects can point to and share the same character
array.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseTLAB Enables the use of thread-local allocation
blocks (TLABs) in the young generation space. This option is
enabled by default. To disable the use of TLABs, specify
-XX:-UseTLAB.</p>

<p>Deprecated and Removed Options These options were
included in the previous release, but have since been
considered unnecessary.</p>

<p>-Xincgc Enables incremental garbage collection. This
option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement.</p>

<p>-Xrunlibname Loads the specified debugging/profiling
library. This option was superseded by the -agentlib
option.</p>

<p>-XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycle=percent Sets the percentage
of time (0 to 100) between minor collections that the
concurrent collector is allowed to run. This option was
deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the
deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.</p>

<p>-XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycleMin=percent Sets the
percentage of time (0 to 100) between minor collections that
is the lower bound for the duty cycle when
-XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing is enabled. This option was
deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the
deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.</p>

<p>-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode Enables the incremental mode for
the CMS collector. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with
no replacement, along with other options that start with
CMSIncremental.</p>

<p>-XX:CMSIncrementalOffset=percent Sets the percentage of
time (0 to 100) by which the incremental mode duty cycle is
shifted to the right within the period between minor
collections. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no
replacement, following the deprecation of the
-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.</p>

<p>-XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing Enables automatic adjustment
of the incremental mode duty cycle based on statistics
collected while the JVM is running. This option was
deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the
deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.</p>

<p>-XX:CMSIncrementalSafetyFactor=percent Sets the
percentage of time (0 to 100) used to add conservatism when
computing the duty cycle. This option was deprecated in JDK
8 with no replacement, following the deprecation of the
-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.</p>

<p>-XX:CMSInitiatingPermOccupancyFraction=percent Sets the
percentage of the permanent generation occupancy (0 to 100)
at which to start a GC. This option was deprecated in JDK 8
with no replacement.</p>

<p>-XX:MaxPermSize=size Sets the maximum permanent
generation space size (in bytes). This option was deprecated
in JDK 8, and superseded by the -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize
option.</p>

<p>-XX:PermSize=size Sets the space (in bytes) allocated to
the permanent generation that triggers a garbage collection
if it is exceeded. This option was deprecated un JDK 8, and
superseded by the -XX:MetaspaceSize option.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseSplitVerifier Enables splitting of the
verification process. By default, this option was enabled in
the previous releases, and verification was split into two
phases: type referencing (performed by the compiler) and
type checking (performed by the JVM runtime). This option
was deprecated in JDK 8, and verification is now split by
default without a way to disable it.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseStringCache Enables caching of commonly
allocated strings. This option was removed from JDK 8 with
no replacement.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE TUNING EXAMPLES The following examples show
how to use experimental tuning flags to either optimize
throughput or to provide lower response time.</p>

<p>Example 1 Tuning for Higher Throughput</p>

<p>java -d64 -server -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseLargePages

<p>LARGE PAGES Also known as huge pages, large pages are
memory pages that are significantly larger than the standard
memory page size (which varies depending on the processor
and operating system). Large pages optimize processor
Translation-Lookaside Buffers.</p>

<p>A Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a page
translation cache that holds the most-recently used
virtual-to-physical address translations. TLB is a scarce
system resource. A TLB miss can be costly as the processor
must then read from the hierarchical page table, which may
require multiple memory accesses. By using a larger memory
page size, a single TLB entry can represent a larger memory
range. There will be less pressure on TLB, and
memory-intensive applications may have better
performance.</p>

<p>However, large pages page memory can negatively affect
system performance. For example, when a large mount of
memory is pinned by an application, it may create a shortage
of regular memory and cause excessive paging in other
applications and slow down the entire system. Also, a system
that has been up for a long time could produce excessive
fragmentation, which could make it impossible to reserve
enough large page memory. When this happens, either the OS
or JVM reverts to using regular pages.</p>

<p>Large Pages Support Solaris and Linux support large
pages.</p>

<p>Solaris Solaris 9 and later include Multiple Page Size
Support (MPSS); no additional configuration is necessary.

<p>Linux The 2.6 kernel supports large pages. Some vendors
have backported the code to their 2.4-based releases. To
check if your system can support large page memory, try the
following:</p>

<p># cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge HugePages_Total: 0
HugePages_Free: 0 Hugepagesize: 2048 kB</p>

<p>If the output shows the three &quot;Huge&quot;
variables, then your system can support large page memory
but it needs to be configured. If the command prints
nothing, then your system does not support large pages. To
configure the system to use large page memory, login as
root, and then follow these steps:</p>

<p>1. If you are using the option -XX:+UseSHM (instead of
-XX:+UseHugeTLBFS), then increase the SHMMAX value. It must
be larger than the Java heap size. On a system with 4 GB of
physical RAM (or less), the following will make all the
memory sharable:</p>

<p># echo 4294967295 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</p>

<p>2. If you are using the option -XX:+UseSHM or
-XX:+UseHugeTLBFS, then specify the number of large pages.
In the following example, 3 GB of a 4 GB system are reserved
for large pages (assuming a large page size of 2048kB, then
3 GB = 3 * 1024 MB = 3072 MB = 3072 * 1024 kB = 3145728 kB
and 3145728 kB / 2048 kB = 1536):</p>

<p># echo 1536 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages</p>

<p>Note +----------------------------------------------+ |
| | &middot; Note that the values | | contained in /proc | |
will reset after you | | reboot your system, | | so may want
to set | | them in an | | initialization | | script (for
example, | | rc.local or | | sysctl.conf). | | | | &middot;
If you configure (or | | resize) the OS | | kernel
parameters | | /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax | | or | |
/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages, | | Java processes may | |
allocate large pages | | for areas in | | addition to the
Java | | heap. These steps | | can allocate large | | pages
for the | | following areas: | | | | &middot; Java heap | |
| | &middot; Code cache | | | | &middot; The marking | |
bitmap data | | structure for | | the parallel GC | | | |
Consequently, if you | | configure the | | nr_hugepages | |
parameter to the | | size of the Java | | heap, then the JVM
| | can fail in | | allocating the code | | cache areas on
large | | pages because these | | areas are quite | | large
in size. |

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are typically
returned by the launcher when the launcher is called with
the wrong arguments, serious errors, or exceptions thrown by
the JVM. However, a Java application may choose to return
any value by using the API call System.exit(exitValue). The
values are:</p>

<p>&middot; 0: Successful completion</p>

<p>&middot; &gt;0: An error occurred</p>
