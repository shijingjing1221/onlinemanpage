<p>PARPORT_UNREGISTER_D(9) Parallel Port Devices
PARPORT_UNREGISTER_D(9)</p>

<p>NAME parport_unregister_driver - deregister a parallel
port device driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void parport_unregister_driver(struct
parport_driver * drv);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS drv structure describing the driver that was
given to parport_register_driver</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This should be called by a parallel port
device driver that has registered itself using
parport_register_driver when it is about to be unloaded.</p>

<p>When it returns, the driver&acute;s attach routine will
no longer be called, and for each port that attach was
called for, the detach routine will have been called.</p>

<p>All the driver&acute;s attach and detach calls are
guaranteed to have finished by the time this function
returns.</p>
