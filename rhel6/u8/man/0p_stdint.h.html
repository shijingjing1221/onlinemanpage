<p>NAME stdint.h - integer types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Some of the functionality described on this
reference page extends the ISO C standard. Applications
shall define the appropriate feature test macro (see the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Sec- tion
2.2, The Compilation Environment) to enable the visibility
of these symbols in this header.</p>

<p>The &lt;stdint.h&gt; header shall declare sets of
integer types having speci- fied widths, and shall define
corresponding sets of macros. It shall also define macros
that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types
defined in other standard headers.</p>

<p>Note: The &quot;width&quot; of an integer type is the
number of bits used to store its value in a pure binary
system; the actual type may use more bits than that (for
example, a 28-bit type could be stored in 32 bits of actual
storage). An N-bit signed type has values in the range
-2**N-1 or 1-2**N-1 to 2**N-1-1, while an N-bit unsigned
type has values in the range 0 to 2**N-1.</p>

<p>Types are defined in the following categories:</p>

<p>* Integer types having certain exact widths</p>

<p>* Integer types having at least certain specified
widths</p>

<p>* Fastest integer types having at least certain
specified widths</p>

<p>* Integer types wide enough to hold pointers to
objects</p>

<p>* Integer types having greatest width</p>

<p>(Some of these types may denote the same type.)</p>

<p>Corresponding macros specify limits of the declared
types and construct suitable constants.</p>

<p>For each type described herein that the implementation
provides, the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header shall declare that
typedef name and define the asso- ciated macros. Conversely,
for each type described herein that the implementation does
not provide, the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header shall not declare
that typedef name, nor shall it define the associated
macros. An implementation shall provide those types
described as required, but need not provide any of the
others (described as optional).</p>

<p>Integer Types When typedef names differing only in the
absence or presence of the initial u are defined, they shall
denote corresponding signed and unsigned types as described
in the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, Section 6.2.5; an
implementation providing one of these corresponding types
shall also provide the other.</p>

<p>In the following descriptions, the symbol N represents
an unsigned dec- imal integer with no leading zeros (for
example, 8 or 24, but not 04 or 048).</p>

<p>* Exact-width integer types</p>

<p>The typedef name int N _t designates a signed integer
type with width N, no padding bits, and a twos-complement
representation. Thus, int8_t denotes a signed integer type
with a width of exactly 8 bits.</p>

<p>The typedef name uint N _t designates an unsigned
integer type with width N. Thus, uint24_t denotes an
unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits.</p>

<p>The following types are required:</p>

<p>int8_t int16_t int32_t uint8_t uint16_t uint32_t</p>

<p>If an implementation provides integer types with width
64 that meet these requirements, then the following types
are required: int64_t uint64_t</p>

<p>In particular, this will be the case if any of the
following are true:</p>

<p>* The implementation supports the _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG
pro- gramming environment and the application is being built
in the _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG programming environment (see
the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, c99,
Pro- gramming Environments).</p>

<p>* The implementation supports the _POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64
program- ming environment and the application is being built
in the _POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64 programming environment.</p>

<p>* The implementation supports the _POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG
pro- gramming environment and the application is being built
in the _POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG programming environment.</p>

<p>All other types of this form are optional.</p>

<p>* Minimum-width integer types</p>

<p>The typedef name int_least N _t designates a signed
integer type with a width of at least N, such that no signed
integer type with lesser size has at least the specified
width. Thus, int_least32_t denotes a signed integer type
with a width of at least 32 bits.</p>

<p>The typedef name uint_least N _t designates an unsigned
integer type with a width of at least N, such that no
unsigned integer type with lesser size has at least the
specified width. Thus, uint_least16_t denotes an unsigned
integer type with a width of at least 16 bits.</p>

<p>The following types are required: int_least8_t
int_least16_t int_least32_t int_least64_t uint_least8_t
uint_least16_t uint_least32_t uint_least64_t</p>

<p>All other types of this form are optional.</p>

<p>* Fastest minimum-width integer types</p>

<p>Each of the following types designates an integer type
that is usually fastest to operate with among all integer
types that have at least the specified width.</p>

<p>The designated type is not guaranteed to be fastest for
all purposes; if the implementation has no clear grounds for
choosing one type over another, it will simply pick some
integer type satisfying the signed- ness and width
requirements.</p>

<p>The typedef name int_fast N _t designates the fastest
signed integer type with a width of at least N. The typedef
name uint_fast N _t desig- nates the fastest unsigned
integer type with a width of at least N.</p>

<p>The following types are required: int_fast8_t
int_fast16_t int_fast32_t int_fast64_t uint_fast8_t
uint_fast16_t uint_fast32_t uint_fast64_t</p>

<p>All other types of this form are optional.</p>

<p>* Integer types capable of holding object pointers</p>

<p>The following type designates a signed integer type with
the property that any valid pointer to void can be converted
to this type, then con- verted back to a pointer to void,
and the result will compare equal to the original pointer:
intptr_t</p>

<p>The following type designates an unsigned integer type
with the prop- erty that any valid pointer to void can be
converted to this type, then converted back to a pointer to
void, and the result will compare equal to the original
pointer: uintptr_t</p>

<p>On XSI-conformant systems, the intptr_t and uintptr_t
types are required; otherwise, they are optional.</p>

<p>* Greatest-width integer types</p>

<p>The following type designates a signed integer type
capable of repre- senting any value of any signed integer
type: intmax_t</p>

<p>The following type designates an unsigned integer type
capable of rep- resenting any value of any unsigned integer
type: uintmax_t</p>

<p>These types are required.</p>

<p>Note: Applications can test for optional types by using
the corre- sponding limit macro from Limits of
Specified-Width Integer Types .</p>

<p>Limits of Specified-Width Integer Types The following
macros specify the minimum and maximum limits of the types
declared in the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header. Each macro name
corresponds to a similar type name in Integer Types .</p>

<p>Each instance of any defined macro shall be replaced by
a constant expression suitable for use in #if preprocessing
directives, and this expression shall have the same type as
would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
type converted according to the integer promotions. Its
implementation-defined value shall be equal to or greater in
magnitude (absolute value) than the corresponding value
given below, with the same sign, except where stated to be
exactly the given value.</p>

<p>Limits of Other Integer Types The following macros
specify the minimum and maximum limits of integer types
corresponding to types defined in other standard
headers.</p>

<p>Each instance of these macros shall be replaced by a
constant expres- sion suitable for use in #if preprocessing
directives, and this expres- sion shall have the same type
as would an expression that is an object of the
corresponding type converted according to the integer promo-
tions. Its implementation-defined value shall be equal to or
greater in magnitude (absolute value) than the corresponding
value given below, with the same sign.</p>

<p>* Limits of ptrdiff_t:</p>

<p>{PTRDIFF_MIN} -65535</p>

<p>{PTRDIFF_MAX} +65535</p>

<p>If sig_atomic_t (see the &lt;signal.h&gt; header) is
defined as a signed integer type, the value of
{SIG_ATOMIC_MIN} shall be no greater than -127 and the value
of {SIG_ATOMIC_MAX} shall be no less than 127; oth- erwise,
sig_atomic_t shall be defined as an unsigned integer type,
and the value of {SIG_ATOMIC_MIN} shall be 0 and the value
of {SIG_ATOMIC_MAX} shall be no less than 255.</p>

<p>If wchar_t (see the &lt;stddef.h&gt; header) is defined
as a signed integer type, the value of {WCHAR_MIN} shall be
no greater than -127 and the value of {WCHAR_MAX} shall be
no less than 127; otherwise, wchar_t shall be defined as an
unsigned integer type, and the value of {WCHAR_MIN} shall be
0 and the value of {WCHAR_MAX} shall be no less than
255.</p>

<p>If wint_t (see the &lt;wchar.h&gt; header) is defined as
a signed integer type, the value of {WINT_MIN} shall be no
greater than -32767 and the value of {WINT_MAX} shall be no
less than 32767; otherwise, wint_t shall be defined as an
unsigned integer type, and the value of {WINT_MIN} shall be
0 and the value of {WINT_MAX} shall be no less than
65535.</p>

<p>Macros for Integer Constant Expressions The following
macros expand to integer constant expressions suitable for
initializing objects that have integer types corresponding
to types defined in the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header. Each macro
name corresponds to a sim- ilar type name listed under
Minimum-width integer types and Greatest- width integer
types.</p>

<p>Each invocation of one of these macros shall expand to
an integer con- stant expression suitable for use in #if
preprocessing directives. The type of the expression shall
have the same type as would an expression that is an object
of the corresponding type converted according to the integer
promotions. The value of the expression shall be that of the
argument.</p>

<p>The argument in any instance of these macros shall be a
decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant with a value that
does not exceed the limits for the corresponding type.</p>

<p>* Macros for minimum-width integer constant
expressions</p>

<p>The macro INTN_C( value) shall expand to an integer
constant expression corresponding to the type int_least N
_t. The macro UINTN_C( value) shall expand to an integer
constant expression corresponding to the type uint_least N
_t. For example, if uint_least64_t is a name for the type
unsigned long long, then UINT64_C(0x123) might expand to the
inte- ger constant 0x123ULL.</p>

<p>* Macros for greatest-width integer constant
expressions</p>

<p>The following macro expands to an integer constant
expression having the value specified by its argument and
the type intmax_t: INT- MAX_C(value)</p>

<p>The following macro expands to an integer constant
expression having the value specified by its argument and
the type uintmax_t: UINT- MAX_C(value)</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The &lt;stdint.h&gt; header is a subset of the
&lt;inttypes.h&gt; header more suit- able for use in
freestanding environments, which might not support the
formatted I/O functions. In some environments, if the
formatted conver- sion support is not wanted, using this
header instead of the &lt;int- types.h&gt; header avoids
defining such a large number of macros.</p>

<p>As a consequence of adding int8_t, the following are
true:</p>

<p>* A byte is exactly 8 bits.</p>

<p>* {CHAR_BIT} has the value 8, {SCHAR_MAX} has the value
127, {SCHAR_MIN} has the value -127 or -128, and {UCHAR_MAX}
has the value 255.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS typedef names beginning with int or
uint and ending with _t may be added to the types defined in
the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header. Macro names beginning with INT
or UINT and ending with _MAX, _MIN, or _C may be added to
the macros defined in the &lt;stdint.h&gt; header.</p>
