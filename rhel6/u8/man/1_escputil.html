<p>NAME escputil - maintain Epson Stylus inkjet
printers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS escputil [ -P printer | -r device ] [ -m model
] [ -u ] [ -c | -n | -a | -i | -d | -o | -s | -l | -M | -h ]
[ -q ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION escputil is a command line utility to
perform various maintenance tasks on Epson Stylus inkjet
printers. These tasks include head alignment, head cleaning,
nozzle check, printer identification, and retrieval of ink
level from the printer.</p>

<p>OPTIONS escputil accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-P, --printer-name=printer Specify the name of the
printer to operate on. The default is the default system
printer.</p>

<p>-r, --raw-device=device Specify the name of the device
to write to directly rather than going through a printer
queue. You must use this (rather than specifying a printer)
when retrieving ink levels or identifying the printer, or if
you wish to perform head alignment without specifying the
printer model.</p>

<p>-m, --model=model Specify the precise printer model for
head alignment.</p>

<p>-u, --new The printer is a new printer (Stylus Color 740
or newer).</p>

<p>-c, --clean-head Clean the print head. This can also be
performed from the printer front panel.</p>

<p>-n, --nozzle-check Print a nozzle test pattern. Dirty or
clogged nozzles will show as gaps in the pattern. If you see
any gaps, you should run a head cleaning pass or two.</p>

<p>-a, --align-head Align the print head. CAUTION: Misuse
of this option may result in poor print quality and/or
damage to the printer. You must either specify the printer
model with the -m option, or use the raw printer device to
allow escputil to detect the printer model.</p>

<p>-i, --ink-level Obtain the ink level from the printer.
This requires read/write access to the raw printer
device.</p>

<p>-d, --identify Query the printer for make and model
information. This requires read/write access to the raw
printer device.</p>

<p>-o, --align-color Align the color print head (used by
Stylus Color 480 and 580 only). CAUTION: Misuse of this
option may result in poor print quality and/or damage to the
printer.</p>

<p>-s, --status Retrieve printer status.</p>

<p>-l, --license Display the license/warranty terms of this
program.</p>

<p>-M, --list-models List the supported printer models.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a list of all command line
options.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Suppress the banner.</p>

<p>BUGS USB-connected printers sometimes fail to identify
or return ink levels. You may have to repeat the command.
This is probably a timing issue in escputil, not a flaw in
the printer.</p>

<p>Anything requiring bidirectional communication with the
printer (iden- tify, ink levels, or head alignment without
specifying the printer model) requires read/write access to
the printer port (for example /dev/lp0). This may require
these operations to be performed as root. In addition,
kernel support is required for bidirectional communica-
tion. For Linux version 2.2, CONFIG_PRINTER_READBACK should
be enabled; this is called CONFIG_PARPORT_1284 on 2.4 and
later kernels.</p>

<p>If the printer is performing self-test or head cleaning
on power up, the identify and ink level commands will time
out, although the printer successfully receives the command.
The command will need to be reis- sued when the printer is
quiescent.</p>
