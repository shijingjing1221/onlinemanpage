<p>XkbGetNamedGeometry(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbGetNamedGeometry(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbGetNamedGeometry - Loads a keyboard geometry
description from this database by name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbGetNamedGeometry (Display *dpy,
XkbDescPtr xkb, Atom name);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to the X server</p>

<p>- xkb keyboard description into which the geometry
should be loaded</p>

<p>- name name of the geometry to be loaded</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION It is also possible to load a keyboard
geometry by name. The X server maintains a database of
keyboard components (see below).</p>

<p>XkbGetNamedGeometry can return BadName if the name
cannot be found.</p>

<p>The X server maintains a database of keyboard
components, identified by component type. The database
contains all the information necessary to build a complete
keyboard description for a particular device, as well as to
assemble partial descriptions. Table 1 identifies the
component types and the type of information they
contain.</p>

<p>Table 1 Server Database Keyboard Components
------------------------------------------------------------------
Component Component Primary Contents May also contain Type

Keymap Complete keyboard descrip- tion Normally assembled
using a complete component from each of the other types</p>

<p>Keycodes Symbolic name for each key Aliases for some
Minimum and maximum legal keys keycodes Symbolic names for
indicators Description of indi- cators physically

<p>Types Key types Real modifier bind- ings and symbolic
names for some vir- tual modifiers</p>

<p>Compatibility Rules used to assign Maps for some indi-
actions to keysyms cators Real modifier bind- ings and

<p>Symbols Symbol mapping for key- Explicit actions and
board keys behaviors for some Modifier mapping keys Symbolic
names for groups Real modifier bind- ings and symbolic names
for some vir- tual modifiers</p>

<p>Geometry Layout of the keyboard Aliases for some keys;
overrides key- codes component aliases Symbolic names for
some indicators Description of indi- cators physically
present</p>

<p>While a keymap is a database entry for a complete
keyboard description, and therefore logically different from
the individual component database entries, the rules for
processing keymap entries are identical to those for the
individual components. In the discussion that fol- lows, the
term component is used to refer to either individual compo-
nents or a keymap.</p>

<p>There may be multiple entries for each of the component
types. An entry may be either complete or partial. Partial
entries describe only a piece of the corresponding keyboard
component and are designed to be combined with other entries
of the same type to form a complete entry.</p>

<p>For example, a partial symbols map might describe the
differences between a common ASCII keyboard and some
national layout. Such a par- tial map is not useful on its
own because it does not include those symbols that are the
same on both the ASCII and national layouts (such as
function keys). On the other hand, this partial map can be
used to configure any ASCII keyboard to use a national
layout.</p>

<p>When a keyboard description is built, the components are
processed in the order in which they appear in Table 1;
later definitions override earlier ones.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadName A font or color of the specified
name does not exist.</p>
