<p>NAME sg_reassign - sends a SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_reassign [--address=A,A...] [--dummy]
[--eight=0|1] [--grown] [--help] [--longlist=0|1]
[--primary] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Send a SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command to
DEVICE. Alternatively this util- ity can find the number of
element in a &quot;grown&quot; or &quot;primary&quot; defect
list with a SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command. These SCSI
commands are defined in SBC-2 for direct access devices
(e.g. a disk). Reassign blocks is designed to change the
physical location of a logical block that is known or
suspected to be defective to another area on the media.
Disks are typically formatted with blocks held in reserve
for this situation.</p>

<p>If neither the --grown nor --primary option is supplied
then one or more addresses need to be given. If the address
(or all of the addresses) fit into 4 bytes and --eight=1 is
not given then the parameter block passed to DEVICE is made
up of 4 byte logical block addresses. If any of the
addresses need more than 4 bytes to represent (i.e. &gt;=
2**32) or --eight=1 is given then the parameter block passed
to DEVICE is made up of 8 byte logical block addresses.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-a, --address=A,A... where A,A... is a string of comma
separated numbers. Each number is interpreted as decimal
unless prefixed by 0x or 0X (or it has a trailing h or H).
If multiple logical block addresses are given they must be
separated by a comma or a (single) space. A string that
contains any space separators needs to be quoted. At least
one address must be given.</p>

<p>-a, --address=- reads one or more logical block
addresses from stdin. These may be comma, space, tab or
linefeed (newline) separated. If a line contains
&quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters on that line are
ignored. Otherwise each non separator sequence of characters
should resolve to a decimal number unless prefixed by 0x or
0X (or has a trailing h ). At least one address must be
given.</p>

<p>-d, --dummy prepare for but do not execute the SCSI
REASSIGN BLOCKS command. Since the REASSIGN BLOCKS command
is essentially irreversible, paranoid users may wish to
check the invocation of this utility before reassigning
defective blocks on a disk. Useful with -vv for those who
wish to view the parameter block that will accom- pany the
command.</p>

<p>-e, --eight=0 | 1 when value is 1 then it sets the
LONGLBA flag in the command indicating that the addresses in
the associated parameter block are 8 byte quantities. When
value is 0 then it clears the LONGLBA flag in the command
indicating that the addresses in the associated parameter
block are 4 byte quantities. If this option is not given
then 4 byte quantities are assumed unless one of the address
is too large.</p>

<p>-g, --grown use the SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command
to determine the num- ber of elements in the &quot;grown
defect list&quot;. When this option is given there is no
reassignment of blocks (i.e. this utility is passive). When
this option is given then the --address= option is not
permitted. See the discussion below concerning the rela-
tionship between reassigned blocks and the grown defect
list. This list is sometimes referred to as the GLIST.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-l, --longlist=0 | 1 sets the REASSIGN BLOCKS cdb field
of the same name to the given value. Only 1000 addresses are
permitted so there should be no need to specify a value of
1. The short list variant restricts the parameter block
length to 2 ** 16 bytes (i.e. about 16000 4 byte addresses
or 8000 8 byte addresses). Added for complete- ness.</p>

<p>-p, --primary use the SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command
to determine the num- ber of elements in the &quot;primary
defect list&quot; which is estab- lished during the
manufacturing process. When this option is given there is no
reassignment of blocks (i.e. this utility is passive). When
this option is given then the --address= option is not
permitted. This list is sometimes referred to as the
PLIST.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES Note that if the ARRE field (for reads) and/or the
AWRE field (for writes) are set in the &quot;Read Write
Error Recovery&quot; mode page then recoverable read and/or
write errors cause automatic reassignment of the defective
block. The PER bit in the same mode page controls whether a
RECOVERED ERROR sense key is reported on not (PER=1 implies
do report). Irrespective of the ARRE, AWRE or PER field
settings, the error counter log pages reflect any errors
(recovered or otherwise). Whenever a block is reassigned, a
new entry is added in the &quot;grown&quot; defect list.
Apart from doing selftests (see sg_senddiag or smartmon-
tools) regularly, monitoring the grown defect list of a disk
is a rea- sonable metric of its health. If the grown list
starts growing quickly that is an ominous sign. The best
grown defect lists are empty ones. The number of elements in
the grown defect list can be viewed with the --grown option.
The contents of the grown defect list can be viewed with the
sginfo -G utility.</p>

<p>If an unrecoverable error is detected at a logical block
address then REASSIGN BLOCKS is needed to reassign the
block. Also if the ARRE and/or AWRE fields are clear and a
recoverable error is detected then the logical block in
question may be reassigned with this utility (oth- erwise
the error counter log pages will continually be incremented
for each recovered access).</p>

<p>The number of blocks held in reserve for the purposes of
REASSIGN BLOCKS is vendor specific and may well be limited
to the zone within the media where the original (defective)
block lay. When this number is exhausted subsequent
invocations of this utility may result in a sense key of
hardware error and an additional sense of No defect spare
loca- tion available. The next step would be to reformat the
disk (or get a replacement).</p>

<p>The SBC-2 draft standard (revision 16) notes that when
multiple addresses are given to the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS
command and there is some failure at one of the later
addresses then all addresses prior to that have already be
reassigned. Care should be taken in such a case.
Re-executing the command with the same addresses will cause
the earlier addresses to be reassigned again. At some stage
the disk will run out of reserved locations. So unless a
large number of addresses are involved it may be safer to
reassign them one address at a time.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_reassign is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
