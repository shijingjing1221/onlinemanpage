<p>NAME convmv - converts filenames from one encoding to
another</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS convmv [options] FILE(S) ... DIRECTORY(S)</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f ENCODING specify the current encoding of the
filename(s) from which should be converted</p>

<p>-t ENCODING specify the encoding to which the
filename(s) should be converted</p>

<p>-i interactive mode (ask y/n for each action)</p>

<p>-r recursively go through directories</p>

<p>--nfc target files will be normalization form C for
UTF-8 (Linux etc.)</p>

<p>--nfd target files will be normalization form D for
UTF-8 (OS X etc.).</p>

<p>--qfrom , --qto be more quiet about the &quot;from&quot;
or &quot;to&quot; of a rename (if it screws up your terminal
e.g.). This will in fact do nothing else than replace any
non-ASCII character (bytewise) with ? and any control
character with * on printout, this does not affect rename
operation itself.</p>

<p>--exec command execute the given command. You have to
quote the command and #1 will be substituted by the old, #2
by the new filename. Using this option link targets will
stay untouched.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>convmv -f latin1 -t utf-8 -r --exec &quot;echo #1 should
be renamed to #2&quot; path/to/files</p>

<p>--list list all available encodings. To get support for
more Chinese or Japanese encodings install the Perl HanExtra
or JIS2K Encode packages.</p>

<p>--lowmem keep memory footprint low by not creating a
hash of all files. This disables checking if symlink targets
are in subtree. Symlink target pointers will be converted
regardlessly. If you convert multiple hundredthousands or
millions of files the memory usage of convmv might grow
quite high. This option would help you out in that case.</p>

<p>--nosmart by default convmv will detect if a filename is
already UTF8 encoded and will skip this file if conversion
from some charset to UTF8 should be performed.
&quot;--nosmart&quot; will also force conversion to UTF-8
for such files, which might result in &quot;double encoded
UTF-8&quot; (see section below).</p>

<p>--fixdouble using the &quot;--fixdouble&quot; option
convmv does only convert files which will still be UTF-8
encoded after conversion. Thats useful for fixing
double-encoded UTF-8 files. All files which are not UTF-8 or
will not result in UTF-8 after conversion will not be
touched. Also see chapter &quot;How to undo double UTF-8
...&quot; below.</p>

<p>--notest Needed to actually rename the files. By default
convmv will just print what it wants to do.</p>

<p>--parsable This is an advanced option that people who
want to write a GUI front end will find useful (some others
maybe, too). It will convmv make print out what it would do
in an easy parsable way. The first column contains the
action or some kind of information, the second column mostly
contains the file that is to be modified and if appropriate
the third column contains the modified value. Each column is
separated by (nullbyte newline). Each row (one action) is
separated by (nullbyte nullbyte newline).</p>

<p>--preserve-mtimes modifying filenames usually causes the
parent directorys mtime being updated. This option allows to
reset the mtime to the old value. If your filesystem
supports sub-second resolution the sub- second part of the
atime and mtime will be lost as Perl does not yet support
that.</p>

<p>--replace if the file to which shall be renamed already
exists, it will be overwritten if the other file content is
equal.</p>

<p>--unescape this option will remove this ugly % hex
sequences from filenames and turn them into (hopefully)
nicer 8-bit characters. After --unescape you might want to
do a charset conversion. This sequences like %20 etc. are
sometimes produced when downloading via http or ftp.</p>

<p>--upper , --lower turn filenames into all upper or all
lower case. When the file is not ASCII-encoded, convmv
expects a charset to be entered via the -f switch.</p>

<p>--dotlessi care about the dotless i/I issue. A lowercase
version of &quot;I&quot; will also be dotless while an
uppercase version of &quot;i&quot; will also be dotted. This
is an issue for Turkish and Azeri.</p>

<p>By the way: The superscript dot of the letter i was
added in the Middle Ages to distinguish the letter (in
manuscripts) from adjacent vertical strokes in such letters
as u, m, and n. J is a variant form of i which emerged at
this time and subsequently became a separate letter.</p>

<p>--help print a short summary of available options</p>

<p>--dump-options print a list of all available options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION convmv is meant to help convert a single
filename, a directory tree and the contained files or a
whole filesystem into a different encoding. It just converts
the filenames, not the content of the files. A special
feature of convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks,
also converts the symlink target pointer in case the symlink
target is being converted, too.</p>

<p>All this comes in very handy when one wants to switch
over from old 8-bit locales to UTF-8 locales. It is also
possible to convert directories to UTF-8 which are already
partly UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain
files are UTF-8 encoded and will skip them by default. To
turn this smartness off use the &quot;--nosmart&quot;
switch.</p>

<p>Filesystem issues Almost all POSIX filesystems do not
care about how filenames are encoded, here are some
exceptions:</p>

<p>HFS+ on OS X / Darwin</p>

<p>Linux and (most?) other Unix-like operating systems use
the so called normalization form C (NFC) for its UTF-8
encoding by default but do not enforce this. Darwin, the
base of the Macintosh OS enforces normalization form D
(NFD), where a few characters are encoded in a different
way. On OS X its not possible to create NFC UTF-8 filenames
because this is prevented at filesystem layer. On HFS+
filenames are internally stored in UTF-16 and when converted
back to UTF-8, for the underlying BSD system to be handable,
NFD is created. See
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1173.html for
defails. I think it was a very bad idea and breaks many
things under OS X which expect a normal POSIX conforming
system. Anywhere else convmv is able to convert files from
NFC to NFD or vice versa which makes interoperability with
such systems a lot easier.</p>

<p>JFS</p>

<p>If people mount JFS partitions with iocharset=utf8,
there is a similar problem, because JFS is designed to store
filenames internally in UTF-16, too; that is because Linux
JFS is really JFS2, which was a rewrite of JFS for OS/2. JFS
partitions should always be mounted with
iocharset=iso8859-1, which is also the default with recent
2.6.6 kernels. If this is not done, JFS does not behave like
a POSIX filesystem and it might happen that certain files
cannot be created at all, for example filenames in
ISO-8859-1 encoding. Only when interoperation with OS/2 is
needed iocharset should be set according to your used locale
charmap.</p>

<p>NFS4</p>

<p>Despite other POSIX filesystems RFC3530 (NFS 4) mandates
UTF-8 but also says: &quot;The nfs4_cs_prep profile does not
specify a normalization form. A later revision of this
specification may specify a particular normalization
form.&quot; In other words, if you want to use NFS4 you
might find the conversion and normalization features of
convmv quite useful.</p>

<p>FAT/VFAT and NTFS</p>

<p>NTFS and VFAT (for long filenames) use UTF-16 internally
to store filenames. You should not need to convert filenames
if you mount one of those filesystems. Use appropriate mount
options instead!</p>

<p>How to undo double UTF-8 (or other) encoded filenames
Sometimes it might happen that you
&quot;double-encoded&quot; certain filenames, for example
the file names already were UTF-8 encoded and you accidently
did another conversion from some charset to UTF-8. You can
simply undo that by converting that the other way round. The
from- charset has to be UTF-8 and the to-charset has to be
the from-charset you previously accidently used. If you use
the &quot;--fixdouble&quot; option convmv will make sure
that only files will be processed that will still be UTF-8
encoded after conversion and it will leave non-UTF-8 files
untouched. You should check to get the correct results by
doing the conversion without &quot;--notest&quot; before,
also the &quot;--qfrom&quot; option might be helpful,
because the double utf-8 file names might screw up your
terminal if they are being printed - they often contain
control sequences which do funny things with your terminal
window. If you are not sure about the charset which was
accidently converted from, using &quot;--qfrom&quot; is a
good way to fiddle out the required encoding without
destroying the file names finally.</p>

<p>How to repair Samba files When in the smb.conf (of Samba
2.x) there hasnt been set a correct &quot;character
set&quot; variable, files which are created from Win*
clients are being created in the client s codepage, e.g.
cp850 for western european languages. As a result of that
the files which contain non-ASCII characters are screwed up
if you &quot;ls&quot; them on the Unix server. If you change
the &quot;character set&quot; variable afterwards to
iso8859-1, newly created files are okay, but the old files
are still screwed up in the Windows encoding. In this case
convmv can also be used to convert the old Samba-shared
files from cp850 to iso8859-1.</p>

<p>By the way: Samba 3.x finally maps to UTF-8 filenames by
default, so also when you migrate from Samba 2 to Samba 3
you might have to convert your file names.</p>

<p>Netatalk interoperability issues When Netatalk is being
switched to UTF-8 which is supported in version 2 then it is
NOT sufficient to rename the file names. There needs to be
done more. See
http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.0/htmldocs/upgrade.html#volumes-and-filenames
and the uniconv utility of Netatalk for details.</p>
