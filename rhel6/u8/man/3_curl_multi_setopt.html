<p>curl_multi_setopt(3) libcurl Manual
curl_multi_setopt(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_multi_setopt - set options for a curl multi
handle</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM * multi_handle,
CURLMoption option, param);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION curl_multi_setopt() is used to tell a
libcurl multi handle how to behave. By using the appropriate
options to curl_multi_setopt(3), you can change libcurl s
behaviour when using that multi handle. All options are set
with the option followed by the parameter param. That
parameter can be a long, a function pointer, an object
pointer or a curl_off_t type, depending on what the specific
option expects. Read this manual carefully as bad input
values may cause libcurl to behave badly! You can only set
one option in each function call.</p>

<p>OPTIONS CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION Pass a pointer to a
function matching the curl_socket_callback prototype. The
curl_multi_socket_action(3) function informs the application
about updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by
doing none, one, or multiple calls to the curl_socket_call-
back given in the param argument. They update the status
with changes since the previous time a curl_multi_socket(3)
function was called. If the given callback pointer is NULL,
no callback will be called. Set the callbacks userp argument
with CURL- MOPT_SOCKETDATA. See curl_multi_socket(3) for
more callback details.</p>

<p>CURLMOPT_SOCKETDATA Pass a pointer to whatever you want
passed to the curl_socket_callback s forth argument, the
userp pointer. This is not used by libcurl but only
passed-thru as-is. Set the call- back pointer with
CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION.</p>

<p>CURLMOPT_PIPELINING Pass a long set to 1 to enable or 0
to disable. Enabling pipelining on a multi handle will make
it attempt to perform HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for
transfers using this han- dle. This means that if you add a
second request that can use an already existing connection,
the second request will be &quot;piped&quot; on the same
connection rather than being executed in parallel. (Added in
7.16.0)</p>

<p>CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION Pass a pointer to a function
matching the curl_multi_timer_call- back prototype. This
function will then be called when the timeout value changes.
The timeout value is at what latest time the application
should call one of the &quot;performing&quot; functions of
the multi interface (curl_multi_socket_action(3) and
curl_multi_perform(3)) - to allow libcurl to keep timeouts
and retries etc to work. A timeout value of -1 means that
there is no timeout at all, and 0 means that the timeout is
already reached. Libcurl attempts to limit calling this only
when the fixed future timeout time actually changes. See
also CURL- MOPT_TIMERDATA. This callback can be used instead
of, or in addition to, curl_multi_timeout(3). (Added in
7.16.0)</p>

<p>CURLMOPT_TIMERDATA Pass a pointer to whatever you want
passed to the curl_multi_timer_callbacks third argument, the
userp pointer. This is not used by libcurl but only
passed-thru as-is. Set the callback pointer with
CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION. (Added in 7.16.0)</p>

<p>CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS Pass a long. The set number will be
used as the maximum amount of simultaneously open
connections that libcurl may cache. Default is 10, and
libcurl will enlarge the size for each added easy handle to
make it fit 4 times the number of added easy han- dles.</p>

<p>By setting this option, you can prevent the cache size
from growing beyond the limit set by you.</p>

<p>When the cache is full, curl closes the oldest one in
the cache to prevent the number of open connections from
increasing.</p>

<p>This option is for the multi handle s use only, when
using the easy interface you should instead use the
CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS option.</p>

<p>(Added in 7.16.3)</p>

<p>RETURNS The standard CURLMcode for multi interface error
codes. Note that it returns a CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if you
try setting an option that this version of libcurl doesnt
know of.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This function was added in libcurl
7.15.4.</p>
