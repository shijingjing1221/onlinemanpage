<p>PERL570DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL570DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl570delta - whats new for perl v5.7.0</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.6.0 release and the 5.7.0 release.</p>

<p>Security Vulnerability Closed A potential security
vulnerability in the optional suidperl component of Perl has
been identified. suidperl is neither built nor installed by
default. As of September the 2nd, 2000, the only known
vulnerable platform is Linux, most likely all Linux
distributions. CERT and various vendors have been alerted
about the vulnerability.</p>

<p>The problem was caused by Perl trying to report a
suspected security exploit attempt using an external
program, /bin/mail. On Linux platforms the /bin/mail program
had an undocumented feature which when combined with
suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in a serious
compromise instead of reporting the exploit attempt. If you
don t have /bin/mail, or if you have safe setuid scripts, or
if suidperl is not installed, you are safe.</p>

<p>The exploit attempt reporting feature has been
completely removed from the Perl 5.7.0 release, so that
particular vulnerability isnt there anymore. However,
further security vulnerabilities are, unfortunately, always
possible. The suidperl code is being reviewed and if deemed
too risky to continue to be supported, it may be completely
removed from future releases. In any case, suidperl should
only be used by security experts who know exactly what they
are doing and why they are using suidperl instead of some
other solution such as sudo ( see
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes &middot; Arrays now always
interpolate into double-quoted strings: constructs like
&quot;foo@bar&quot; now always assume @bar is an array,
whether or not the compiler has seen use of @bar.</p>

<p>&middot; The semantics of bless(REF, REF) were unclear
and until someone proves it to make some sense, it is
forbidden.</p>

<p>&middot; A reference to a reference now stringify as
&quot;REF(0x81485ec)&quot; instead of
&quot;SCALAR(0x81485ec)&quot; in order to be more consistent
with the return value of ref().</p>

<p>&middot; The very dusty examples in the eg/ directory
have been removed. Suggestions for new shiny examples
welcome but the main issue is that the examples need to be
documented, tested and (most importantly) maintained.</p>

<p>&middot; The obsolete chat2 library that should never
have been allowed to escape the laboratory has been
decommissioned.</p>

<p>&middot; The unimplemented POSIX regex features [[.cc.]]
and [[=c=]] are still recognised but now cause fatal errors.
The previous behaviour of ignoring them by default and
warning if requested was unacceptable since it, in a way,
falsely promised that the features could be used.</p>

<p>&middot; The (bogus) escape sequences 8 and 9 now give
an optional warning (&quot;Unrecognized escape passed
through&quot;). There is no need to &minus;escape any
&quot;264</p>

<p>&middot; lstat(FILEHANDLE) now gives a warning because
the operation makes no sense. In future releases this may
become a fatal error.</p>

<p>&middot; The long deprecated uppercase aliases for the
string comparison operators (EQ, NE, LT, LE, GE, GT) have
now been removed.</p>

<p>&middot; The regular expression captured submatches ($1,
$2, ...) are now more consistently unset if the match fails,
instead of leaving false data lying around in them.</p>

<p>&middot; The tr///C and tr///U features have been
removed and will not return; the interface was a mistake.
Sorry about that. For similar functionality, see pack(U0,
...) and pack(C0, ...).</p>

<p>Core Enhancements &middot; &quot;perl
-d:Module=arg,arg,arg&quot; now works (previously one
couldnt pass in multiple arguments.)</p>

<p>&middot; my __PACKAGE__ $obj now works.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;no Module;&quot; now works even if there
is no &quot;sub unimport&quot; in the Module.</p>

<p>&middot; The numerical comparison operators return
&quot;undef&quot; if either operand is a NaN. Previously the
behaviour was unspecified.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;pack(&rsquo;U0a*&rsquo;, ...)&quot; can
now be used to force a string to UTF-8.</p>

<p>&middot; prototype() is now available.</p>

<p>&middot; There is now an UNTIE method.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata New Modules &middot; File::Temp
allows one to create temporary files and directories in an
easy, portable, and secure way.</p>

<p>&middot; Storable gives persistence to Perl data
structures by allowing the storage and retrieval of Perl
data to and from files in a fast and compact binary
format.</p>

<p>Updated And Improved Modules and Pragmata &middot; The
following independently supported modules have been updated
to newer versions from CPAN: CGI, CPAN, DB_File, File::Spec,
Getopt::Long, the podlators bundle, Pod::LaTeX, Pod::Parser,
Term::ANSIColor, Test.</p>

<p>&middot; Bug fixes and minor enhancements have been
applied to B::Deparse, Data::Dumper, IO::Poll,
IO::Socket::INET, Math::BigFloat, Math::Complex, Math::Trig,
Net::protoent, the re pragma, SelfLoader, Sys::SysLog,
Test::Harness, Text::Wrap, UNIVERSAL, and the warnings
pragma.</p>

<p>&middot; The attributes::reftype() now works on tied
arguments.</p>

<p>&middot; AutoLoader can now be disabled with &quot;no
AutoLoader;&quot;,</p>

<p>&middot; The English module can now be used without the
infamous performance hit by saying</p>

<p>use English &rsquo;-no_performance_hit&rsquo;;</p>

<p>(Assuming, of course, that one doesn t need the
troublesome variables &quot;$&lsquo;&quot;, $&amp;, or
&quot;$&rsquo;&quot;.) Also, introduced @LAST_MATCH_START
and @LAST_MATCH_END English aliases for &quot;@-&quot; and
&quot;@+&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; File::Find now has pre- and post-processing
callbacks. It also correctly changes directories when
chasing symbolic links. Callbacks (naughtily) exiting with
&quot;next;&quot; instead of &quot;return;&quot; now
work.</p>

<p>&middot; File::Glob::glob() renamed to
File::Glob::bsd_glob() to avoid prototype mismatch with
CORE::glob().</p>

<p>&middot; IPC::Open3 now allows the use of numeric file
descriptors.</p>

<p>&middot; use lib now works identically to @INC. Removing
directories with no lib now works.</p>

<p>&middot; %INC now localised in a Safe compartment so
that use/require work.</p>

<p>&middot; The Shell module now has an OO interface.</p>

<p>Utility Changes &middot; The Emacs perl mode
(emacs/cperl-mode.el) has been updated to version 4.31.</p>

<p>&middot; Perlbug is now much more robust. It also sends
the bug report to perl.org, not perl.com.</p>

<p>&middot; The perlcc utility has been rewritten and its
user interface (that is, command line) is much more like
that of the UNIX C compiler, cc.</p>

<p>&middot; The xsubpp utility for extension writers now
understands POD documentation embedded in the *.xs
files.</p>

<p>New Documentation &middot; perl56delta details the
changes between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.0 release.</p>

<p>&middot; perldebtut is a Perl debugging tutorial.</p>

<p>&middot; perlebcdic contains considerations for running
Perl on EBCDIC platforms. Note that unfortunately EBCDIC
platforms that used to supported back in Perl 5.005 are
still unsupported by Perl 5.7.0; the plan, however, is to
bring them back to the fold.</p>

<p>&middot; perlnewmod tells about writing and submitting a
new module.</p>

<p>&middot; perlposix-bc explains using Perl on the
POSIX-BC platform (an EBCDIC mainframe platform).</p>

<p>&middot; perlretut is a regular expression tutorial.</p>

<p>&middot; perlrequick is a regular expressions
quick-start guide. Yes, much quicker than perlretut.</p>

<p>&middot; perlutil explains the command line utilities
packaged with the Perl distribution.</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements &middot; map() that changes the
size of the list should now work faster.</p>

<p>&middot; sort() has been changed to use mergesort
internally as opposed to the earlier quicksort. For very
small lists this may result in slightly slower sorting
times, but in general the speedup should be at least 20%.
Additional bonuses are that the worst case behaviour of
sort() is now better (in computer science terms it now runs
in time O(N log N), as opposed to quicksorts Theta(N**2)
worst-case run time behaviour), and that sort() is now
stable (meaning that elements with identical keys will stay
ordered as they were before the sort).</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements Generic
Improvements &middot; INSTALL now explains how you can
configure Perl to use 64-bit integers even on non-64-bit
platforms.</p>

<p>&middot; Policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a
Policy.sh file (see INSTALL) and you use Configure
-Dprefix=/foo/bar and in the old Policy $prefix eq
$siteprefix and $prefix eq $vendorprefix, all of them will
now be changed to the new prefix, /foo/bar. (Previously only
$prefix changed.) If you do not like this new behaviour,
specify prefix, siteprefix, and vendorprefix explicitly.</p>

<p>&middot; A new optional location for Perl libraries,
otherlibdirs, is available. It can be used for example for
vendor add-ons without disturbing Perls own library
directories.</p>

<p>&middot; In many platforms the vendor-supplied cc is too
stripped-down to build Perl (basically, cc doesnt do ANSI
C). If this seems to be the case and cc does not seem to be
the GNU C compiler gcc, an automatic attempt is made to find
and use gcc instead.</p>

<p>&middot; gcc needs to closely track the operating system
release to avoid build problems. If Configure finds that gcc
was built for a different operating system release than is
running, it now gives a clearly visible warning that there
may be trouble ahead.</p>

<p>&middot; If binary compatibility with the 5.005 release
is not wanted, Configure no longer suggests including the
5.005 modules in @INC.</p>

<p>&middot; Configure &quot;-S&quot; can now run
non-interactively.</p>

<p>&middot; configure.gnu now works with options with
whitespace in them.</p>

<p>&middot; installperl now outputs everything to
STDERR.</p>

<p>&middot; $Config{byteorder} is now computed dynamically
(this is more robust with &quot;fat binaries&quot; where an
executable image contains binaries for more than one binary
platform.)</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes &middot; Several debugger fixes: exit
code now reflects the script exit code, condition
&quot;0&quot; now treated correctly, the &quot;d&quot;
command now checks line number, the $. no longer gets
corrupted, all debugger output now goes correctly to the
socket if RemotePort is set.</p>

<p>&middot; *foo{FORMAT} now works.</p>

<p>&middot; Lexical warnings now propagating correctly
between scopes.</p>

<p>&middot; Line renumbering with eval and
&quot;#line&quot; now works.</p>

<p>&middot; Fixed numerous memory leaks, especially in eval
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Modulus of unsigned numbers now works
(4063328477 % 65535 used to return 27406, instead of
27047).</p>

<p>&middot; Some &quot;not a number&quot; warnings
introduced in 5.6.0 eliminated to be more compatible with
5.005. Infinity is now recognised as a number.</p>

<p>&middot; our() variables will not cause &quot;will not
stay shared&quot; warnings.</p>

<p>&middot; pack &quot;Z&quot; now correctly terminates the
string with &quot; &quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Fix password routines which in some shadow
password platforms (e.g. HP-UX) caused getpwent() to return
every other entry.</p>

<p>&middot; printf() no longer resets the numeric locale to
&quot;C&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;q(a\b)&quot; now parses correctly as
&rsquo;a\b&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; Printing quads (64-bit integers) with
printf/sprintf now works without the q L ll prefixes
(assuming you are on a quad-capable platform).</p>

<p>&middot; Regular expressions on references and
overloaded scalars now work.</p>

<p>&middot; scalar() now forces scalar context even when
used in void context.</p>

<p>&middot; sort() arguments are now compiled in the right
wantarray context (they were accidentally using the context
of the sort() itself).</p>

<p>&middot; Changed the POSIX character class
&quot;[[:space:]]&quot; to include the (very rare) vertical
tab character. Added a new POSIX-ish character class
&quot;[[:blank:]]&quot; which stands for horizontal
whitespace (currently, the space and the tab).</p>

<p>&middot; $AUTOLOAD, sort(), lock(), and spawning
subprocesses in multiple threads simultaneously are now
thread-safe.</p>

<p>&middot; Allow read-only string on left hand side of
non-modifying tr///.</p>

<p>&middot; Several Unicode fixes (but still not
perfect).</p>

<p>&middot; BOMs (byte order marks) in the beginning of
Perl files (scripts, modules) should now be transparently
skipped. UTF-16 (UCS-2) encoded Perl files should now be
read correctly.</p>

<p>&middot; The character tables have been updated to
Unicode 3.0.1.</p>

<p>&middot; chr() for values greater than 127 now create
utf8 when under use utf8.</p>

<p>&middot; Comparing with utf8 data does not magically
upgrade non-utf8 data into utf8.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;IsAlnum&quot;, &quot;IsAlpha&quot;, and
&quot;IsWord&quot; now match titlecase.</p>

<p>&middot; Concatenation with the &quot;.&quot; operator
or via variable interpolation, &quot;eq&quot;,
&quot;substr&quot;, &quot;reverse&quot;,
&quot;quotemeta&quot;, the &quot;x&quot; operator,
substitution with &quot;s///&quot;, single-quoted UTF-8,
should now work--in theory.</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;tr///&quot; operator now works
slightly better but is still rather broken. Note that the
&quot;tr///CU&quot; functionality has been removed (but see
pack(U0, ...)).</p>

<p>&middot; vec() now refuses to deal with characters
&gt;255.</p>

<p>&middot; Zero entries were missing from the Unicode
classes like &quot;IsDigit&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; UNIVERSAL::isa no longer caches methods
incorrectly. (This broke the Tk extension with 5.6.0.)</p>

<p>Platform Specific Changes and Fixes &middot; BSDI
4.*</p>

<p>Perl now works on post-4.0 BSD/OSes.</p>

<p>&middot; All BSDs</p>

<p>Setting $0 now works (as much as possible; see perlvar
for details).</p>

<p>&middot; Cygwin</p>

<p>Numerous updates; currently synchronised with Cygwin
1.1.4.</p>

<p>&middot; EPOC</p>

<p>EPOC update after Perl 5.6.0. See README.epoc.</p>

<p>&middot; FreeBSD 3.*</p>

<p>Perl now works on post-3.0 FreeBSDs.</p>

<p>&middot; HP-UX</p>

<p>README.hpux updated; &quot;Configure -Duse64bitall&quot;
now almost works.</p>

<p>&middot; IRIX</p>

<p>Numerous compilation flag and hint enhancements;
accidental mixing of 32-bit and 64-bit libraries (a doomed
attempt) made much harder.</p>

<p>&middot; Linux</p>

<p>Long doubles should now work (see INSTALL).</p>

<p>&middot; Mac OS Classic</p>

<p>Compilation of the standard Perl distribution in Mac OS
Classic should now work if you have the Metrowerks
development environment and the missing Mac-specific toolkit
bits. Contact the macperl mailing list for details.</p>

<p>&middot; MPE/iX</p>

<p>MPE/iX update after Perl 5.6.0. See README.mpeix.</p>

<p>&middot; NetBSD/sparc</p>

<p>Perl now works on NetBSD/sparc.</p>

<p>&middot; OS/2</p>

<p>Now works with usethreads (see INSTALL).</p>

<p>&middot; Solaris</p>

<p>64-bitness using the Sun Workshop compiler now
works.</p>

<p>&middot; Tru64 (aka Digital UNIX, aka DEC OSF/1)</p>

<p>The operating system version letter now recorded in
$Config{osvers}. Allow compiling with gcc (previously
explicitly forbidden). Compiling with gcc still not
recommended because buggy code results, even with gcc
2.95.2.</p>

<p>&middot; Unicos</p>

<p>Fixed various alignment problems that lead into core
dumps either during build or later; no longer dies on math
errors at runtime; now using full quad integers (64 bits),
previously was using only 46 bit integers for speed.</p>

<p>&middot; VMS</p>

<p>chdir() now works better despite a CRT bug; now works
with MULTIPLICITY (see INSTALL); now works with Perl s
malloc.</p>

<p>&middot; Windows</p>

<p>&middot; accept() no longer leaks memory.</p>

<p>&middot; Better chdir() return value for a non-existent
directory.</p>

<p>&middot; New %ENV entries now propagate to
subprocesses.</p>

<p>&middot; $ENV{LIB} now used to search for libs under
Visual C.</p>

<p>&middot; A failed (pseudo)fork now returns undef and
sets errno to EAGAIN.</p>

<p>&middot; Allow REG_EXPAND_SZ keys in the registry.</p>

<p>&middot; Can now send() from all threads, not just the
first one.</p>

<p>&middot; Fake signal handling reenabled, bugs and
all.</p>

<p>&middot; Less stack reserved per thread so that more
threads can run concurrently. (Still 16M per thread.)</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir()&quot; now prefers
C:/temp over /tmp (works better when perl is running as
service).</p>

<p>&middot; Better UNC path handling under ithreads.</p>

<p>&middot; wait() and waitpid() now work much better.</p>

<p>&middot; winsock handle leak fixed.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics All regular expression
compilation error messages are now hopefully easier to
understand both because the error message now comes before
the failed regex and because the point of failure is now
clearly marked.</p>

<p>The various &quot;opened only for&quot;, &quot;on
closed&quot;, &quot;never opened&quot; warnings drop the
&quot;main::&quot; prefix for filehandles in the
&quot;main&quot; package, for example &quot;STDIN&quot;
instead of &lt;main::STDIN&gt;.</p>

<p>The &quot;Unrecognized escape&quot; warning has been
extended to include &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, and
&quot;_&quot;. There is no need to escape any of the
&quot;288</p>

<p>Changed Internals &middot; perlapi.pod (a companion to
perlguts) now attempts to document the internal API.</p>

<p>&middot; You can now build a really minimal perl called
microperl. Building microperl does not require even running
Configure; &quot;make -f Makefile.micro&quot; should be
enough. Beware: microperl makes many assumptions, some of
which may be too bold; the resulting executable may crash or
otherwise misbehave in wondrous ways. For careful hackers
only.</p>

<p>&middot; Added rsignal(), whichsig(), do_join() to the
publicised API.</p>

<p>&middot; Made possible to propagate customised
exceptions via croak()ing.</p>

<p>&middot; Added is_utf8_char(), is_utf8_string(),
bytes_to_utf8(), and utf8_to_bytes().</p>

<p>&middot; Now xsubs can have attributes just like
subs.</p>

<p>Known Problems Unicode Support Still Far From Perfect
Were working on it. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>EBCDIC Still A Lost Platform The plan is to bring them
back.</p>

<p>Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles
Certain extensions like mod_perl and BSD::Resource are known
to have issues with largefiles, a change brought by Perl
5.6.0 in which file offsets default to 64 bits wide, where
supported. Modules may fail to compile at all or compile and
work incorrectly. Currently there is no good solution for
the problem, but Configure now provides appropriate
non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the
%Config hash (e.g., $Config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the
extensions that are having problems can try configuring
themselves without the largefileness. This is admittedly not
a clean solution, and the solution may not even work at all.
One potential failure is whether one can (or, if one can,
whether its a good idea) link together at all binaries with
different ideas about file offsets, all this is platform-
dependent.</p>

<p>ftmp-security tests warnsystem possibly insecure Dont
panic. Read INSTALL make test section instead.</p>

<p>Test lib/posix Subtest 9 Fails In LP64-Configured HP-UX
If perl is configured with -Duse64bitall, the successful
result of the subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the
successful result of the subtest 9, which confuses the test
harness so much that it thinks the subtest 9 failed.</p>

<p>Long Doubles Still Dot Work In Solaris The experimental
long double support is still very much so in Solaris. (Other
platforms like Linux and Tru64 are beginning to solidify in
this area.)</p>

<p>Linux With Sfio Fails op/misc Test 48 No known fix.</p>

<p>Storable tests fail in some platforms If any Storable
tests fail the use of Storable is not advisable.</p>

<p>&middot; Many Storable tests fail on AIX configured with
64 bit integers.</p>

<p>So far unidentified problems break Storable in AIX if
Perl is configured to use 64 bit integers. AIX in 32-bit
mode works and other 64-bit platforms work with
Storable.</p>

<p>&middot; DOS DJGPP may hang when testing Storable.</p>

<p>&middot; st-06compat fails in UNICOS and UNICOS/mk.</p>

<p>This means that you cannot read old (pre-Storable-0.7)
Storable images made in other platforms.</p>

<p>&middot; st-store.t and st-retrieve may fail with Compaq
C 6.2 on OpenVMS Alpha 7.2.</p>

<p>Threads Are Still Experimental Multithreading is still
an experimental feature. Some platforms emit the following
message for lib/thr5005</p>

<p># # This is a KNOWN FAILURE, and one of the reasons why
threading # is still an experimental feature. It is here to
stop people # from deploying threads in production. ;-)
#</p>

<p>and another known thread-related warning is</p>

<p>pragma/overload......Unbalanced saves: 3 more saves than
restores panic: magic_mutexfree during global destruction.
ok lib/selfloader.......Unbalanced saves: 3 more saves than
restores panic: magic_mutexfree during global destruction.
ok lib/st-dclone........Unbalanced saves: 3 more saves than
restores panic: magic_mutexfree during global destruction.
ok</p>

<p>The Compiler Suite Is Still Experimental The compiler
suite is slowly getting better but is nowhere near working
order yet. The backend part that has seen perhaps the most
progress is the bytecode compiler.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org/ There may also be information at
http://www.perl.com/perl/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team.</p>
