<p>RCS(1) RCS(1)</p>

<p>NAME rcs - change RCS file attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcs options file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rcs creates new RCS files or changes
attributes of existing ones. An RCS file contains multiple
revisions of text, an access list, a change log, descriptive
text, and some control attributes. For rcs to work, the
caller s login name must be on the access list, except if
the access list is empty, the caller is the owner of the
file or the supe- ruser, or the -i option is present.</p>

<p>Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all
others denote working files. Names are paired as explained
in ci(1). Revision num- bers use the syntax described in
ci(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i Create and initialize a new RCS file, but do
not deposit any revision. If the RCS file has no path
prefix, try to place it first into the subdirectory ./RCS,
and then into the current directory. If the RCS file already
exists, print an error mes- sage.</p>

<p>-alogins Append the login names appearing in the
comma-separated list logins to the access list of the RCS
file.</p>

<p>-Aoldfile Append the access list of oldfile to the
access list of the RCS file.</p>

<p>-e[logins] Erase the login names appearing in the
comma-separated list logins from the access list of the RCS
file. If logins is omit- ted, erase the entire access
list.</p>

<p>-b[rev] Set the default branch to rev. If rev is
omitted, the default branch is reset to the (dynamically)
highest branch on the trunk.</p>

<p>-cstring Set the comment leader to string. An initial
ci, or an rcs -i without -c, guesses the comment leader from
the suffix of the working filename.</p>

<p>This option is obsolescent, since RCS normally uses the
preced- ing $Log$ lines prefix when inserting log lines
during checkout (see co(1)). However, older versions of RCS
use the comment leader instead of the $Log$ lines prefix, so
if you plan to access a file with both old and new versions
of RCS, make sure its comment leader matches its $Log$ line
prefix.</p>

<p>-ksubst Set the default keyword substitution to subst.
The effect of keyword substitution is described in co(1).
Giving an explicit -k option to co, rcsdiff, and rcsmerge
overrides this default. Beware rcs -kv, because -kv is
incompatible with co -l. Use rcs -kkv to restore the normal
default keyword substitution.</p>

<p>-l[rev] Lock the revision with number rev. If a branch
is given, lock the latest revision on that branch. If rev is
omitted, lock the latest revision on the default branch.
Locking prevents over- lapping changes. If someone else
already holds the lock, the lock is broken as with rcs -u
(see below).</p>

<p>-u[rev] Unlock the revision with number rev. If a branch
is given, unlock the latest revision on that branch. If rev
is omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.
Normally, only the locker of a revision can unlock it.
Somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock. This
causes a mail message to be sent to the original locker. The
message contains a commentary solicited from the breaker.
The commentary is terminated by end-of-file or by a line
containing . by itself.</p>

<p>-L Set locking to strict. Strict locking means that the
owner of an RCS file is not exempt from locking for checkin.
This option should be used for files that are shared.</p>

<p>-U Set locking to non-strict. Non-strict locking means
that the owner of a file need not lock a revision for
checkin. This option should not be used for files that are
shared. Whether default locking is strict is determined by
your system adminis- trator, but it is normally strict.</p>

<p>-mrev:msg Replace revision revs log message with
msg.</p>

<p>-M Do not send mail when breaking somebody else s lock.
This option is not meant for casual use; it is meant for
programs that warn users by other means, and invoke rcs -u
only as a low- level lock-breaking operation.</p>

<p>-nname[:[rev]] Associate the symbolic name name with the
branch or revision rev. Delete the symbolic name if both :
and rev are omitted; otherwise, print an error message if
name is already associated with another number. If rev is
symbolic, it is expanded before association. A rev
consisting of a branch number followed by a . stands for the
current latest revision in the branch. A : with an empty rev
stands for the current latest revision on the default
branch, normally the trunk. For example, rcs -nname: RCS/*
associates name with the current latest revi- sion of all
the named RCS files; this contrasts with rcs -nname:$ RCS/*
which associates name with the revision num- bers extracted
from keyword strings in the corresponding working files.</p>

<p>-Nname[:[rev]] Act like -n, except override any previous
assignment of name.</p>

<p>-orange deletes (outdates) the revisions given by range.
A range con- sisting of a single revision number means that
revision. A range consisting of a branch number means the
latest revision on that branch. A range of the form
rev1:rev2 means revisions rev1 to rev2 on the same branch,
:rev means from the beginning of the branch containing rev
up to and including rev, and rev: means from revision rev to
the end of the branch containing rev. None of the outdated
revisions can have branches or locks.</p>

<p>-q Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.</p>

<p>-I Run interactively, even if the standard input is not
a terminal.</p>

<p>-sstate[:rev] Set the state attribute of the revision
rev to state. If rev is a branch number, assume the latest
revision on that branch. If rev is omitted, assume the
latest revision on the default branch. Any identifier is
acceptable for state. A useful set of states is Exp (for
experimental), Stab (for stable), and Rel (for released). By
default, ci(1) sets the state of a revision to Exp.</p>

<p>-t[file] Write descriptive text from the contents of the
named file into the RCS file, deleting the existing text.
The file pathname cannot begin with -. If file is omitted,
obtain the text from standard input, terminated by
end-of-file or by a line contain- ing . by itself. Prompt
for the text if interaction is possi- ble; see -I. With -i,
descriptive text is obtained even if -t is not given.</p>

<p>-t-string Write descriptive text from the string into
the RCS file, delet- ing the existing text.</p>

<p>-T Preserve the modification time on the RCS file unless
a revision is removed. This option can suppress extensive
recompilation caused by a make(1) dependency of some copy of
the working file on the RCS file. Use this option with care;
it can suppress recompilation even when it is needed, i.e.
when a change to the RCS file would mean a change to keyword
strings in the working file.</p>

<p>-V Print RCSs version number.</p>

<p>-Vn Emulate RCS version n. See co(1) for details.</p>

<p>-xsuffixes Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See
ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>-zzone Use zone as the default time zone. This option
has no effect; it is present for compatibility with other
RCS commands.</p>

<p>At least one explicit option must be given, to ensure
compatibility with future planned extensions to the rcs
command.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY The -brev option generates an RCS file
that cannot be parsed by RCS version 3 or earlier.</p>

<p>The -ksubst options (except -kkv) generate an RCS file
that cannot be parsed by RCS version 4 or earlier.</p>

<p>Use rcs -Vn to make an RCS file acceptable to RCS
version n by discard- ing information that would confuse
version n.</p>

<p>RCS version 5.5 and earlier does not support the -x
option, and requires a ,v suffix on an RCS pathname.</p>

<p>FILES rcs accesses files much as ci(1) does, except that
it uses the effec- tive user for all accesses, it does not
write the working file or its directory, and it does not
even read the working file unless a revision number of $ is
specified.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RCSINIT options prepended to the argument
list, separated by spaces. See ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The RCS pathname and the revisions outdated
are written to the diagnos- tic output. The exit status is
zero if and only if all operations were successful.</p>

<p>BUGS A catastrophe (e.g. a system crash) can cause RCS
to leave behind a semaphore file that causes later
invocations of RCS to claim that the RCS file is in use. To
fix this, remove the semaphore file. A semaphore files name
typically begins with , or ends with _.</p>

<p>The separator for revision ranges in the -o option used
to be - instead of :, but this leads to confusion when
symbolic names contain -. For backwards compatibility rcs -o
still supports the old - separator, but it warns about this
obsolete use.</p>

<p>Symbolic names need not refer to existing revisions or
branches. For example, the -o option does not remove
symbolic names for the outdated revisions; you must use -n
to remove the names.</p>
