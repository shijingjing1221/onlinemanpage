<p>NAME XmGetVisibility A function that determines if a
widget is visible</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; XmVisibility
XmGetVisibility( Widget widget);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmGetVisibility returns the visibility state
of the specified widget. It checks to see if some part of
the widget s rectangular area is unob- scured by the widget
s ancestors, or some part of the widgets rectan- gular area
is inside the work window (but possibly outside the clip
window) of a ScrolledWindow whose XmNscrollingPolicy is
XmAUTOMATIC and whose XmNtraverseObscuredCallback is not
NULL.</p>

<p>XmGetVisibility does not check to see if widget is
obscured by its sib- lings or by siblings of its ancestors.
Consequently, XmGetVisibility returns
XmVISIBILITY_UNOBSCURED for widgets which are completely or
partially covered by one or more siblings of widget by one
or more sib- lings of ancestors of widget.</p>

<p>When a widget which is unrealized is being queried, it
is indicated that the widget is fully obscured. If an
application unmaps a widget that has its
XmNmappedWhenManaged resource set to True, the return value
is undefined. When a widget which is unmanaged is being
queried, it is indicated that the widget is fully
obscured.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the ID of the widget</p>

<p>RETURN Returns one of the following values:</p>

<p>XmVISIBILITY_UNOBSCURED Indicates that the widget is
mapped, not obscured, and is completely visible on the
screen.</p>

<p>XmVISIBILITY_PARTIALLY_OBSCURED Indicates that the
widget is mapped, and is not completely visible on the
screen (partially obscured).</p>

<p>XmVISIBILITY_FULLY_OBSCURED Indicates that the widget is
not at all visible on the screen.</p>
