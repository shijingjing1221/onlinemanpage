<p>NAME nss_pcache - Helper program used to store token
password pins</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nss_pcache &lt;semid&gt; &lt;fips on/off&gt;
&lt;directory&gt; [prefix]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A helper program used by the Apache httpd
mod_nss plug-in to store the NSS PKCS #11 token password
pins between restarts of Apache.</p>

<p>Whenever an Apache httpd process configured to use the
mod_nss plug-in is started, this program will be
automatically invoked via reference to the mod_nss
configuration file stored under /etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf
which contains the following default entry:</p>

<p># Pass Phrase Helper: # This helper program stores the
token password pins between # restarts of Apache. # # NOTE:
Located at /usr/sbin/nss_pcache prior # to mod_nss-1.0.8-22.
# NSSPassPhraseHelper /usr/libexec/nss_pcache</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;semid&gt; The semaphore which corresponds to
the mod_nss plug-in regis- tered with the Apache httpd
process during startup.</p>

<p>&lt;fips on/off&gt; Specifies whether FIPS mode should
be enabled, on, or disabled, off. By default, FIPS mode is
disabled, and no variable is specified in
/etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf. To enable FIPS mode, establish
password access for the specified NSS security databases,
and specify the following variable in
/etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf:</p>

<p>NSSFIPS on</p>

<p>&lt;directory&gt; Specifies the destination directory of
the NSS databases that will be associated with this
executable specified by the follow- ing entry in
/etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf:</p>

<p># Server Certificate Database: # The NSS security
database directory that holds the # certificates and keys.
The database consists # of 3 files: cert8.db, key3.db and
secmod.db. # Provide the directory that these files exist.
NSSCertificateDatabase /etc/httpd/alias</p>

<p>[prefix] Optional prefix to attach prior to the names of
the NSS certifi- cate and key databases contained in the
directory referenced by the previous argument and specified
by the following entry in /etc/httpd/conf.d/nss.conf (must
be uncommented in order to be utilized):</p>

<p># Database Prefix: # In order to be able to store
multiple NSS databases # in one directory they need unique
names. This option # sets the database prefix used for
cert8.db and key3.db. #NSSDBPrefix my-prefix-</p>
