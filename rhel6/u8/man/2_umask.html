<p>UMASK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual UMASK(2)</p>

<p>NAME umask - set file mode creation mask</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>mode_t umask(mode_t mask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION umask() sets the calling process s file mode
creation mask (umask) to mask &amp; 0777 (i.e., only the
file permission bits of mask are used), and returns the
previous value of the mask.</p>

<p>The umask is used by open(2), mkdir(2), and other system
calls that create files to modify the permissions placed on
newly created files or directories. Specifically,
permissions in the umask are turned off from the mode
argument to open(2) and mkdir(2).</p>

<p>The constants that should be used to specify mask are
described under stat(2).</p>

<p>The typical default value for the process umask is
S_IWGRP | S_IWOTH (octal 022). In the usual case where the
mode argument to open(2) is specified as:</p>

<p>S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH |
S_IWOTH</p>

<p>(octal 0666) when creating a new file, the permissions
on the resulting file will be:</p>

<p>S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH</p>

<p>(because 0666 &amp; ~022 = 0644; i.e., rw-r--r--).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This system call always succeeds and the
previous value of the mask is returned.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES A child process created via fork(2) inherits its
parents umask. The umask is left unchanged by execve(2).</p>

<p>The umask setting also affects the permissions assigned
to POSIX IPC objects (mq_open(3), sem_open(3), shm_open(3)),
FIFOs (mkfifo(3)), and Unix domain sockets (unix(7)) created
by the process. The umask does not affect the permissions
assigned to System V IPC objects created by the process
(using msgget(2), semget(2), shmget(2)).</p>
