<p>NAME Xau library: XauFileName, XauReadAuth, XauLockAuth,
XauUnlockAuth, XauWriteAuth, XauDisposeAuth,
XauGetAuthByAddr, XauGetBestAuthByAddr - X authority
database routines</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/Xauth.h&gt;</p>

<p>typedef struct xauth { unsigned short family; unsigned
short address_length; char *address; unsigned short
number_length; char *number; unsigned short name_length;
char *name; unsigned short data_length; char *data; }
Xauth;</p>

<p>char *XauFileName (void);</p>

<p>Xauth *XauReadAuth (FILE *auth_file);</p>

<p>int XauWriteAuth (FILE *auth_file, Xauth *auth);</p>

<p>Xauth *XauGetAuthByAddr (unsigned short family, unsigned
short address_length, const char *address, unsigned short
number_length, const char *number, unsigned short
name_length, const char *name);</p>

<p>Xauth *XauGetBestAuthByAddr (unsigned short family,
unsigned short address_length, const char *address, unsigned
short number_length, const char *number, int types_length,
char **types, const int *type_lengths);</p>

<p>int XauLockAuth (const char *file_name, int retries, int
timeout, long dead);</p>

<p>int XauUnlockAuth (const char *file_name);</p>

<p>int XauDisposeAuth (Xauth *auth);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XauFileName generates the default
authorization file name by first checking the XAUTHORITY
environment variable if set, else it returns
$HOME/.Xauthority. This name is statically allocated and
should not be freed.</p>

<p>XauReadAuth reads the next entry from auth_file. The
entry is not statically allocated and should be freed by
calling XauDisposeAuth.</p>

<p>XauWriteAuth writes an authorization entry to auth_file.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.</p>

<p>XauGetAuthByAddr searches for an entry which matches the
given network address/display number pair. The entry is not
statically allocated and should be freed by calling
XauDisposeAuth.</p>

<p>XauGetBestAuthByAddr is similar to XauGetAuthByAddr,
except that a list of acceptable authentication methods is
specified. Xau will choose the file entry which matches the
earliest entry in this list (e.g., the most secure
authentication method). The types argument is an array of
strings, one string for each authentication method.
types_length spec- ifies how many elements are in the types
array. types_lengths is an array of integers representing
the length of each string.</p>

<p>XauLockAuth does the work necessary to synchronously
update an autho- rization file. First it makes two file
names, one with -c appended to file_name, the other with -l
appended. If the -c file already exists and is more than
dead seconds old, XauLockAuth removes it and the associated
-l file. To prevent possible synchronization troubles with
NFS, a dead value of zero forces the files to be removed.
XauLockAuth makes retries attempts to create and link the
file names, pausing timeout seconds between each attempt.
XauLockAuth returns a collection of values depending on the
results:</p>

<p>LOCK_ERROR A system error occurred, either a file_name
which is too long, or an unexpected failure from a system
call. errno may prove useful.</p>

<p>LOCK_TIMEOUT retries attempts failed</p>

<p>LOCK_SUCCESS The lock succeeded.</p>

<p>XauUnlockAuth undoes the work of XauLockAuth by
unlinking both the -c and -l file names.</p>

<p>XauDisposeAuth frees storage allocated to hold an
authorization entry.</p>
