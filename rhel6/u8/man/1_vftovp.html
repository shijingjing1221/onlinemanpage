<p>VFTOVP(1) VFTOVP(1)</p>

<p>NAME vftovp - convert virtual font (vf) files to virtual
property lists (vpl)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vftovp [ -charcode-format=format ] [ -verbose ]
vf_name[.vf] tfm_name[.tfm] [ vpl_name[.vpl] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The vftovp program translates a (program-oriented)
virtual font file and its accompanying TeX font metric file
to a (human-oriented) prop- erty list file. Thus, the
virtual font can be edited, and its exact contents can be
displayed mnemonically. It also serves as a VF-file
validating program; if no error messages are given, the
input files are correct.</p>

<p>The filenames are extended with the appropriate
extension if necessary.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The argument format to -charcode-format
specifies how character codes are output in the VPL file. By
default, only letters and digits are output using the C
integer code (i.e., in ASCII); the others are output in
octal. (Unless the fonts coding scheme starts with TeX math
sy or TeX math ex, when all are output in octal.) If format
is ascii, all character codes that correspond to graphic
characters, besides the left and right parentheses, are
output in ASCII. On the other hand, if for- mat is octal,
all character codes are output in octal.</p>

<p>Without the -verbose option, vftovp operates silently.
With it, a ban- ner and progress report are printed on
stdout.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT vftovp looks for vf_name using the
environment variable VFFONTS. If that is not set, it uses
the variable TEXFONTS. If that is not set, it uses the
system default.</p>

<p>See tex(1) for the details of the searching.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pltotf(1), tftopl(1), vptovf(1).</p>

<p>AUTHORS Donald E. Knuth wrote the program, based in part
on an idea of David Fuchs, starting with the code for
tftopl(1). Karl Berry adapted it for compilation with
web2c.</p>
