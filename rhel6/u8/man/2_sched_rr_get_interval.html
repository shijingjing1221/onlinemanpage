<p>SCHED_RR_GET_INTERVAL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SCHED_RR_GET_INTERVAL(2)</p>

<p>NAME sched_rr_get_interval - get the SCHED_RR interval
for the named process</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sched.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sched_rr_get_interval(pid_t pid, struct timespec *
tp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sched_rr_get_interval() writes into the
timespec structure pointed to by tp the round-robin time
quantum for the process identified by pid.</p>

<p>The timespec structure has the following form:</p>

<p>struct timespec { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ };</p>

<p>If pid is zero, the time quantum for the calling process
is written into *tp. The identified process should be
running under the SCHED_RR scheduling policy. POSIX systems
on which sched_rr_get_interval() is available define
_POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in &lt;unistd.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, sched_rr_get_interval() returns
0. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT Problem with copying information to
userspace.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid pid.</p>

<p>ENOSYS The system call is not yet implemented (only on
rather old ker- nels).</p>

<p>ESRCH The process whose ID is pid could not be
found.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux Notes POSIX does not specify any mechanism
for controlling the size of the round-robin time quantum.
However, Linux provides a (non-portable) method of doing
this. The quantum can be controlled by adjusting the process
s nice value (see setpriority(2)). Assigning a negative
(i.e., high) nice value results in a longer quantum;
assigning a positive (i.e., low) nice value results in a
shorter quantum. The default quan- tum is 0.1 seconds; the
degree to which changing the nice value affects the quantum
has varied somewhat across kernel versions.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO sched_setscheduler(2) has a description of the
Linux scheduling scheme.</p>
