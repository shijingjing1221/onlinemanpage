<p>NAME ldns-compare-zones - read and compare two zonefiles
and print differ- ences</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-compare-zones [-c] [-i] [-d] [-z] [-s]
ZONEFILE1 ZONEFILE2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-compare-zones reads two DNS zone files
and prints number of dif- ferences. Output is formated to:
+NUM_INS -NUM_DEL ~NUM_CHG</p>

<p>The major comparison is based on the owner name. If an
owner name is present in zonefile 1, but not in zonefile 2,
the resource records with this owner name are considered
deleted, and counted as NUM_DEL. If an owner name is present
in zonefile 2, but not in zonefile 1, the resource records
with this owner name are considered inserted, and counted as
NUM_INS. If an owner name is present in both, but there is a
difference in the amount or content of the records, these
are consid- ered changed, and counted as NUM_CHG.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Print resource records whose owner names are
in both zone files, but with different resource records.
(a.k.a. changed)</p>

<p>-i Print resource records whose owner names are present
only in ZONEFILE2 (a.k.a. inserted)</p>

<p>-d Print resource records whose owner names are present
only in ZONEFILE1 (a.k.a. deleted)</p>

<p>-a Print all changes. Specifying this option is the same
as speci- fying -c -i amd -d.</p>

<p>-z Suppress zone sorting; this option is not
recommended; it can cause records to be incorrectly marked
as changed, depending of the nature of the changes.</p>

<p>-s Do not exclude the SOA record from the comparison.
The SOA record may then show up as changed due to a new
serial number. Off by default since you may be interested to
know if (other zone apex elements) have changed.</p>

<p>-h Show usage and exit</p>

<p>-v Show the version and exit</p>
