<p>sane-u12(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane-u12(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-u12 - SANE backend for Plustek USB flatbed
scanners, based on older parport designs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-u12 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) back- end that provides access to
USB flatbed scanners based on Plusteks ASIC 98003
(parallel-port ASIC) and a GeneSys Logics USB-parport bridge
chip.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED DEVICES The backend is able to support some
early Plustek USB scanner based their old parport design
around the ASIC 98003 and other rebadged Plus- tek devices.
The following tables will give you a short overview.</p>

<p>If your Plustek scanner has another Product ID, then the
device is NOT supported by this backend.</p>

<p>Vendor Plustek - ID: 0x07B3

OpticPro UT12 0x07B3 0x0001</p>

<p>Vendor KYE/Genius

ColorPage Vivid III USB 0x07B3 0x0001 ColorPage HR6 V1
0x0458 0x2004</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION To use your scanner with this backend, you
need at least two entries in the configuration file
/etc/sane.d/u12.conf [usb] vendor-id product-id device
/dev/usbscanner</p>

<p>[usb] tells the backend, that the following devicename
(here /dev/usb- scanner) has to be interpreted as USB
scanner device. If vendor- and product-id has not been
specified, the backend tries to detect this by its own. If
device is set to auto then the next matching device is
used.</p>

<p>The Options:</p>

<p>option warmup t t specifies the warmup period in
seconds</p>

<p>option lampOff t t is the time in seconds for switching
off the lamps in standby mode</p>

<p>option lOffonEnd b b specifies the behaviour when
closing the backend, 1 --&gt; switch lamps off, 0 --&gt; do
not change lamp status</p>

<p>See the u12.conf file for examples.</p>

<p>Note: You have to make sure, that the USB subsystem is
loaded correctly and you have access to the device-node. For
more details see sane-usb (5) manpage. You might use
sane-find-scanner to check that you have access to your
device.</p>

<p>Note: If theres no configuration file, the backend
defaults to device auto</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/u12.conf The backend configuration
file</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-u12.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-u12.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_U12 If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels increase
the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_U12=10</p>

<p>CONTACT AND BUG-REPORTS Please send any information and
bug-reports to: SANE Mailing List</p>

<p>Additional info and hints can be obtained from our
Mailing-List archive at:
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</p>

<p>or directly from the projects homepage at:
http://www.gjaeger.de/scanner/u12/</p>

<p>To obtain debug messages from the backend, please set
the environment- variable SANE_DEBUG_U12 before calling your
favorite scan-frontend (i.e. xscanimage). i.e.: export
SANE_DEBUG_U12=20 ; xscanimage</p>

<p>The value controls the verbosity of the backend.</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS &amp; RESTRICTIONS * The driver is in alpha
state, so please dont expect too much!!!</p>

<p>* When using libusb, it might be, that the backend
hangs. In that case, reconnect the scanner.</p>
