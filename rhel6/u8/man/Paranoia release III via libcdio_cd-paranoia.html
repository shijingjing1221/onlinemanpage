<p>NAME cd-paranoia 9.8 (Paranoia release III via libcdio)
- an audio CD read- ing utility which includes extra data
verification features</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cd-paranoia [options] span [outfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cd-paranoia retrieves audio tracks from CDDA
capable CD-ROM drives. The data can be saved to a file or
directed to standard output in WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C or raw
format. Most ATAPI, SCSI and several proprietary CD-ROM
drive makes are supported; cd-paranoia can determine if the
tar- get drive is CDDA capable.</p>

<p>In addition to simple reading, cd-paranoia adds
extra-robust data veri- fication, synchronization, error
handling and scratch reconstruction capability.</p>

<p>This version uses the libcdio library for interaction
with a CD-ROM drive. The jitter and error correction however
are the same as used in Xiphs cdparanoia.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v --verbose Be absurdly verbose about the
autosensing and reading process. Good for setup and
debugging.</p>

<p>-q --quiet Do not print any progress or error
information during the read- ing process.</p>

<p>-e --stderr-progress Force output of progress
information to stderr (for wrapper scripts).</p>

<p>-V --version Print the program version and quit.</p>

<p>-Q --query Perform CD-ROM drive autosense, query and
print the CD-ROM table of contents, then quit.</p>

<p>-s --search-for-drive Forces a complete search for a
cdrom drive, even if the /dev/cdrom link exists.</p>

<p>-h --help Print a brief synopsis of cd-paranoia usage
and options.</p>

<p>-l --log-summary file Save result summary to file.</p>

<p>-p --output-raw Output headerless data as raw 16 bit PCM
data with interleaved samples in host byte order. To force
little or big endian byte order, use -r or -R as described
below.</p>

<p>-r --output-raw-little-endian Output headerless data as
raw 16 bit PCM data with interleaved samples in LSB first
byte order.</p>

<p>-R --output-raw-big-endian Output headerless data as raw
16 bit PCM data with interleaved samples in MSB first byte
order.</p>

<p>-w --output-wav Output data in Micro$oft RIFF WAV format
(note that WAV data is always LSB first byte order).</p>

<p>-f --output-aiff Output data in Apple AIFF format (note
that AIFC data is always in MSB first byte order).</p>

<p>-a --output-aifc Output data in uncompressed Apple
AIFF-C format (note that AIFF- C data is always in MSB first
byte order).</p>

<p>-B --batch</p>

<p>Cdda2wav-style batch output flag; cd-paranoia will split
the output into multiple files at track boundaries. Output
file names are prepended with track#.</p>

<p>-c --force-cdrom-little-endian Some CD-ROM drives
misreport their endianness (or do not report it at all); its
possible that cd-paranoia will guess wrong. Use -c to force
cd-paranoia to treat the drive as a little endian
device.</p>

<p>-C --force-cdrom-big-endian As above but force
cd-paranoia to treat the drive as a big endian device.</p>

<p>-n --force-default-sectors n Force the interface backend
to do atomic reads of n sectors per read. This number can be
misleading; the kernel will often split read requests into
multiple atomic reads (the automated Paranoia code is aware
of this) or allow reads only wihin a restricted size range.
This option should generally not be used.</p>

<p>-d --force-cdrom-device device Force the interface
backend to read from device rather than the first readable
CD-ROM drive it finds containing a CD-DA disc. This can be
used to specify devices of any valid interface type (ATAPI,
SCSI or proprietary).</p>

<p>-g --force-generic-device device This option is an alias
for -d and is retained for compatibil- ity.</p>

<p>-S --force-read-speed number Use this option explicitly
to set the read rate of the CD drive (where supported). This
can reduce underruns on machines with slow disks, or which
are low on memory.</p>

<p>-t --toc-offset number Use this option to force the
entire disc LBA addressing to shift by the given amount; the
value is added to the beginning offsets in the TOC. This can
be used to shift track boundaries for the whole disc
manually on sector granularity. The next option does
something similar...</p>

<p>-T --toc-bias Some drives (usually random Toshibas)
report the actual track beginning offset values in the TOC,
but then treat the beginning of track 1 index 1 as sector 0
for all read operations. This results in every track seeming
to start too late (losing a bit of the beginning and
catching a bit of the next track). -T accounts for this
behavior. Note that this option will cause cd-paranoia to
attempt to read sectors before or past the known user data
area of the disc, resulting in read errors at disc edges on
most drives and possibly even hard lockups on some buggy
hardware.</p>

<p>-O --sample-offset number Some CD-ROM/CD-R drives will
add an offset to the position on reading audio data. This is
usually around 500-700 audio samples (ca. 1/75 second) on
reading. So when cd-paranoia queries a spe- cific sector, it
might not receive exactly that sector, but shifted by some
amount.</p>

<p>Use this option to force the entire disc to shift sample
position out- put by the given amount; This can be used to
shift track boundaries for the whole disc manually on sample
granularity. Note that if you are ripping something
including the ending of the CD (e.g. the entire disk), this
option will cause cd-paranoia to attempt to read partial
sectors before or past the known user data area, probably
causing read errors on most drives and possibly even hard
lockups on some buggy hardware.</p>

<p>-Z --disable-paranoia Disable all data verification and
correction features. When using -Z, cd-paranoia reads data
exactly as would cdda2wav with an overlap setting of zero.
This option implies that -Y is active.</p>

<p>-z --never-skip[=max_retries] Do not accept any skips;
retry forever if needed. An optional maximum number of
retries can be specified; for comparison, default without -z
is currently 20.</p>

<p>-Y --disable-extra-paranoia Disables intra-read data
verification; only overlap checking at read boundaries is
performed. It can wedge if errors occur in the attempted
overlap area. Not recommended.</p>

<p>-X --abort-on-skip If the read skips due to imperfect
data, a scratch, whatever, abort reading this track. If
output is to a file, delete the partially completed
file.</p>

<p>-x --test-flags mask Simulate CD-reading errors. This is
used in regression testing, but other uses might be to see
how well a CD-ROM performs under (simulated) CD degradation.
mask specifies the artificial kinds of errors to introduced;
&quot;or&quot;-ing values from the selection below will
simulate the kind of specified failure.</p>

<p>0x10 - Simulate under-run reading</p>

<p>OUTPUT SMILIES</p>

<p>:-) Normal operation, low/no jitter</p>

<p>:-| Normal operation, considerable jitter</p>

<p>- Jitter correction required</p>

<p>+ Unreported loss of streaming/other error in read</p>

<p>! Errors found after stage 1 correction; the drive is
making the same error through multiple re-reads, and
cd-paranoia is having trouble detecting them.</p>

<p>e SCSI/ATAPI transport error (corrected)</p>

<p>V Uncorrected error/skip</p>

<p>SPAN ARGUMENT The span argument specifies which track,
tracks or subsections of tracks to read. This argument is
required. NOTE: Unless the span is a simple number, its
generally a good idea to quote the span argument to protect
it from the shell.</p>

<p>The span argument may be a simple track number or an
offset/span speci- fication. The syntax of an offset/span
takes the rough form:</p>

<p>1[ww:xx:yy.zz]-2[aa:bb:cc.dd]</p>

<p>Here, 1 and 2 are track numbers; the numbers in brackets
provide a finer grained offset within a particular track.
[aa:bb:cc.dd] is in hours/minutes/seconds/sectors format.
Zero fields need not be speci- fied: [::20], [:20], [20],
[20.], etc, would be interpreted as twenty seconds, [10:]
would be ten minutes, [.30] would be thirty sectors (75
sectors per second).</p>

<p>When only a single offset is supplied, it is interpreted
as a starting offset and ripping will continue to the end of
the track. If a single offset is preceeded or followed by a
hyphen, the implicit missing off- set is taken to be the
start or end of the disc, respectively. Thus:</p>

<p>1:[20.35] Specifies ripping from track 1, second 20,
sector 35 to the end of track 1.</p>

<p>1:[20.35]- Specifies ripping from 1[20.35] to the end of
the disc</p>

<p>-2 Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up
to (and including) track 2</p>

<p>-2:[30.35] Specifies ripping from the beginning of the
disc up to 2:[30.35]</p>

<p>2-4 Specifies ripping from the beginning of track 2 to
the end of track 4.</p>

<p>Again, don t forget to protect square brackets and
preceeding hyphens from the shell.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A few examples, protected from the shell:</p>

<p>Query only with exhaustive search for a drive and full
reporting of autosense:</p>

<p>cd-paranoia -vsQ</p>

<p>Extract an entire disc, putting each track in a seperate
file:</p>

<p>cd-paranoia -B</p>

<p>Extract from track 1, time 0:30.12 to 1:10.00:</p>

<p>cd-paranoia &quot;1[:30.12]-1[1:10]&quot;</p>

<p>Extract from the beginning of the disc up to track
3:</p>

<p>cd-paranoia -- &quot;-3&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;--&quot; above is to distinguish
&quot;-3&quot; from an option flag.</p>

<p>OUTPUT The output file argument is optional; if it is
not specified, cd-para- noia will output samples to one of
cdda.wav, cdda.aifc, or cdda.raw depending on whether -w,
-a, -r or -R is used (-w is the implicit default). The
output file argument of - specifies standard output; all
data formats may be piped.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS cd-paranoia sprang from and once drew
heavily from the interface of Heiko Eissfeldts
(heiko@colossus.escape.de) cdda2wav package. cd- paranoia
would not have happened without it.</p>

<p>Joerg Schilling has also contributed SCSI expertise
through his generic SCSI transport library.</p>
