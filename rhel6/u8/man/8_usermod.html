<p>USERMOD(8) System Management Commands USERMOD(8)</p>

<p>NAME usermod - modify a user account</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS usermod [options] LOGIN</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The usermod command modifies the system
account files to reflect the changes that are specified on
the command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the usermod command
are:</p>

<p>-a, --append Add the user to the supplementary group(s).
Use only with the -G option.</p>

<p>-c, --comment COMMENT The new value of the user&acute;s
password file comment field. It is normally modified using
the chfn(1) utility.</p>

<p>-d, --home HOME_DIR The user&acute;s new login
directory.</p>

<p>If the -m option is given, the contents of the current
home directory will be moved to the new home directory,
which is created if it does not already exist. If the
current home directory does not exist the new home directory
will not be created.</p>

<p>-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE The date on which the user
account will be disabled. The date is specified in the
format YYYY-MM-DD.</p>

<p>An empty EXPIRE_DATE argument will disable the
expiration of the account.</p>

<p>This option requires a /etc/shadow file. A /etc/shadow
entry will be created if there were none.</p>

<p>-f, --inactive INACTIVE The number of days after a
password expires until the account is permanently
disabled.</p>

<p>A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the
password has expired, and a value of -1 disables the
feature.</p>

<p>This option requires a /etc/shadow file. A /etc/shadow
entry will be created if there were none.</p>

<p>-g, --gid GROUP The group name or number of the
user&acute;s new initial login group. The group must
exist.</p>

<p>Any file from the user&acute;s home directory owned by
the previous primary group of the user will be owned by this
new group.</p>

<p>The group ownership of files outside of the user&acute;s
home directory must be fixed manually.</p>

<p>-G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]] A list of
supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no
intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same
restrictions as the group given with the -g option.</p>

<p>If the user is currently a member of a group which is
not listed, the user will be removed from the group. This
behaviour can be changed via the -a option, which appends
the user to the current supplementary group list.</p>

<p>-l, --login NEW_LOGIN The name of the user will be
changed from LOGIN to NEW_LOGIN. Nothing else is changed. In
particular, the user&acute;s home directory or mail spool
should probably be renamed manually to reflect the new login
name.</p>

<p>-L, --lock Lock a user&acute;s password. This puts a
&acute;!&acute; in front of the encrypted password,
effectively disabling the password. You can&acute;t use this
option with -p or -U.</p>

<p>Note: if you wish to lock the account (not only access
with a password), you should also set the EXPIRE_DATE to
1.</p>

<p>-m, --move-home Move the content of the user&acute;s
home directory to the new location. If the current home
directory does not exist the new home directory will not be
created.</p>

<p>This option is only valid in combination with the -d (or
--home) option.</p>

<p>usermod will try to adapt the ownership of the files and
to copy the modes, ACL and extended attributes, but manual
changes might be needed afterwards.</p>

<p>-o, --non-unique When used with the -u option, this
option allows to change the user ID to a non-unique
value.</p>

<p>-p, --password PASSWORD The encrypted password, as
returned by crypt(3).</p>

<p>Note: This option is not recommended because the
password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users
listing the processes.</p>

<p>You should make sure the password respects the
system&acute;s password policy.</p>

<p>-R, --root CHROOT_DIR Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR
directory and use the configuration files from the
CHROOT_DIR directory.</p>

<p>-s, --shell SHELL The name of the user&acute;s new login
shell. Setting this field to blank causes the system to
select the default login shell.</p>

<p>-u, --uid UID The new numerical value of the
user&acute;s ID.</p>

<p>This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.
The value must be non-negative.</p>

<p>The user&acute;s mailbox, and any files which the user
owns and which are located in the user&acute;s home
directory will have the file user ID changed
automatically.</p>

<p>The ownership of files outside of the user&acute;s home
directory must be fixed manually.</p>

<p>No checks will be performed with regard to the UID_MIN,
UID_MAX, SYS_UID_MIN, or SYS_UID_MAX from
/etc/login.defs.</p>

<p>-U, --unlock Unlock a user&acute;s password. This
removes the &acute;!&acute; in front of the encrypted
password. You can&acute;t use this option with -p or -L.</p>

<p>Note: if you wish to unlock the account (not only access
with a password), you should also set the EXPIRE_DATE (for
example to 99999, or to the EXPIRE value from
/etc/default/useradd).</p>

<p>-Z, --selinux-user SEUSER The new SELinux user for the
user&acute;s login.</p>

<p>A blank SEUSER will remove the SELinux user mapping for
user LOGIN (if any).</p>

<p>CAVEATS You must make certain that the named user is not
executing any processes when this command is being executed
if the user&acute;s numerical user ID, the user&acute;s
name, or the user&acute;s home directory is being changed.
usermod checks this on Linux, but only check if the user is
logged in according to utmp on other architectures.</p>

<p>You must change the owner of any crontab files or at
jobs manually.</p>

<p>You must make any changes involving NIS on the NIS
server.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>MAIL_DIR (string) The mail spool directory. This is
needed to manipulate the mailbox when its corresponding user
account is modified or deleted. If not specified, a
compile-time default is used.</p>

<p>MAIL_FILE (string) Defines the location of the users
mail spool files relatively to their home directory.</p>

<p>The MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE variables are used by
useradd, usermod, and userdel to create, move, or delete the
user&acute;s mail spool.</p>

<p>If MAIL_CHECK_ENAB is set to yes, they are also used to
define the MAIL environment variable.</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>/etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

gpasswd(8), groupadd(8), groupdel(8), groupmod(8),
