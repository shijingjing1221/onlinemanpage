<p>NAME gvpack - merge and pack disjoint graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gvpack [ -nguv? ] [ -mmargin ] [ -ooutfile ] [
-Gname=value ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gvpack reads in a stream of graphs, combines
the graphs into a single layout, and produces a single graph
serving as the union of the input graphs. The input graphs
must be in dot format, and must have all nec- essary layout
information. Acceptable input is produced by applying a
Graphviz layout program, such as dot or neato, with no -T
flag.</p>

<p>By default, the packing is done at the cluster level.
Thus, parts of one graph will not intrude into any top-level
clusters or overlap any nodes or edges of another.</p>

<p>The output of gvpack can be used to produce concrete
output by applying neato -s -n2 with the desired -T
flag.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-g Combines the graphs at the graph level. This uses
more space, but prevents parts of one graph from occurring
between parts of another.</p>

<p>-Gname=value Specifies attributes to be added to the
resulting union graph. For example, this can be used to
specify a graph label.</p>

<p>-mmargin Packs the graphs allowing a margin of output
points around the parts.</p>

<p>-n Combines the graphs at the node level. Clusters are
ignored in the packing.</p>

<p>-ooutput Prints output to the file output. If not given,
gvpack uses std- out.</p>

<p>-u Dont pack the graphs. Just combine them into a single
graph.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p>-? Prints usage information and exit.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot
format. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES gvpack returns 0 if there were no problems,
and non-zero otherwise.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ccomps -x abc.dot | dot | gvpack | neato -s -n2
-Tps This pipeline decomposes the graph in abc.dot into its
connected components, lays out each using dot, packs them
all together again, and produces the final drawing in
PostScript. Of course, there is nothing to prevent one from
using different layouts for each component.</p>

<p>BUGS All the input graphs must be directed or
undirected.</p>

<p>An input graph should not have a label, since this will
be used in its layout. Since gvpack ignores root graph
labels, resulting layout may contain some extra space.</p>

<p>gvpack unsets the bounding box attribute of all
non-cluster subgraphs.</p>
