<p>NAME applydeltarpm - reconstruct an rpm from a
deltarpm</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS applydeltarpm [-v] [-p] [-r oldrpm] deltarpm
newrpm applydeltarpm -c|-C deltarpm applydeltarpm [-c|-C] -s
sequence applydeltarpm -i deltarpm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION applydeltarpm applies a binary delta to
either an old rpm or to on-disk data to re-create a new rpm.
The old rpm can be specified with the -r option, if no rpm
name is provided on-disk data is used. You can use -p to
make applydeltarpm print the percentage of completion, or -v
to make it more verbose about its operation.</p>

<p>The second an third form can be used to check if the
reconstruction is possible. It may fail if the on-disk data
got changed (deltarpms are created in a way that config file
changes do not matter) or the deltarpm does not match the
rpm the delta was generated with. The -c option selects full
(i.e. slow) on-disk checking, whereas -C only checks if the
filesizes have not changed.</p>

<p>Instead of a full deltarpm a sequence id can be given
with the -s sequence option. Such an id contains all the
information that is needed to do reconstruction
checking.</p>

<p>Finally information about a deltarpm can be printed with
the -i option.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS applydeltarpm returns 0 if the rpm could be
recreated or the checking succeeded, it returns 1 and prints
an error message to stderr if some- thing failed.</p>
