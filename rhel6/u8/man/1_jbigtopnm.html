<p>NAME jbigtopnm - JBIG to PNM image file converter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jbigtopnm [options] [input-file
[output-file]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>jbigtopnm reads a JBIG bi-level image entity (BIE) from
a file or stan- dard input, decompresses it, and outputs a
PBM or PGM file. If the input has one plane, or you choose
just one plane of it, the output is PBM. Otherwise, the
output is PGM.</p>

<p>JBIG is a highly effective lossless compression
algorithm for bi-level images (one bit per pixel), which is
particularly suitable for scanned document pages.</p>

<p>A JBIG encoded image can be stored in several
resolutions in one or several BIEs. All resolution layers
except the lowest one are stored efficiently as differences
to the next lower resolution layer. You can use options -x
and -y to stop the decompression at a specified maximal
output image size. The input file can consist of several
concatenated BIEs which contain different increasing
resolution layers of the same image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -x number Decode only up to the largest
resolution layer which is still not more than number pixels
wide. If no such resolution layer exists, then use the
smallest one available.</p>

<p>-y number Decode only up to the largest resolution layer
which is still not more than number pixels high. If no such
resolution layer exists, then use the smallest one
available. You can also use options -x and -y together which
selects the largest layer that satisfies both limits.</p>

<p>-b Use binary values instead of Gray code words in order
to decode pixel values from multiple bitplanes. This option
has effect only if the input has more than one bitplane and
you dont select just one of those bitplanes. Note that the
decoder has to be used in the same mode as the encoder and
cannot determine from the BIE, whether Gray or binary code
words were used by the encoder.</p>

<p>-d Diagnose a BIE. With this option, jbigtopnm only
prints a sum- mary of the header information found in the
input file and then exits.</p>

<p>-p number If the input contains multiple bitplanes, then
extract only the specified single plane as a PBM file. The
first plane has num- ber 0.</p>

<p>STANDARDS This program implements the JBIG image coding
algorithm as specified in ISO/IEC 11544:1993 and ITU-T
T.82(1993).</p>

Kuhn, part of his JBIG-KIT package . The jbgtopbm program is
