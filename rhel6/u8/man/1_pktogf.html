<p>PKTOGF(1) PKTOGF(1)</p>

<p>NAME pktogf - convert packed font files to generic font
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pktogf [ -v ] pk_file_name [ gf_file_name ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The pktogf program converts a packed font file (pk) to a
generic font file (gf). Packed font files are much smaller
than the corresponding gf files, but some DVI readers only
understand gf files.</p>

<p>The pk_file_name on the command line must be complete.
Because the res- olution is part of the extension, it would
not make sense to append a default extension as is done with
TeX or DVI-reading software. The gf_file_name defaults to
the same (stripped) name as pk_file_name, and it is placed
in the current working directory with the gf suffix
replacing pk. For example, the input file io.300pk would
become io.300gf.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Unless the -v switch is given, pktogf operates
silently. With -v, the version number of the program and
statistics about the unpacking are output to stdout.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT pktogf looks for pk_file_name using the
environment variable PKFONTS. If that is not set, it uses
the variable TEXPKS. If that is not set, it uses TEXFONTS.
If that is not set, it uses the system default.</p>

<p>See tex(1) for the details of the searching.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Tomas Rokicki wrote the program. Pierre MacKay
adapted it for compila- tion with web2c.</p>
