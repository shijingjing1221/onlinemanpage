<p>RRDFETCH(1) rrdtool RRDFETCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME rrdfetch - Fetch data from an RRD.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rrdtool fetch filename CF [--resolution|-r
resolution] [--start|-s start] [--end|-e end]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fetch function is normally used
internally by the graph function to get data from RRDs.
fetch will analyze the RRD and try to retrieve the data in
the resolution requested. The data fetched is printed to
stdout. *UNKNOWN* data is often represented by the string
&quot;NaN&quot; depending on your OSs printf function.</p>

<p>filename the name of the RRD you want to fetch the data
from.</p>

<p>CF the consolidation function that is applied to the
data you want to fetch (AVERAGE,MIN,MAX,LAST)</p>

<p>--resolution|-r resolution (default is the highest
resolution) the interval you want the values to have
(seconds per value). rrdfetch will try to match your
request, but it will return data even if no absolute match
is possible. NB. See note below.</p>

<p>--start|-s start (default end-1day) start of the time
series. A time in seconds since epoch (1970-01-01) is
required. Negative numbers are relative to the current time.
By default, one day worth of data will be fetched. See also
AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION section for a detailed
explanation on ways to specify the start time.</p>

<p>--end|-e end (default now) the end of the time series in
seconds since epoch. See also AT- STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION
section for a detailed explanation of how to specify the end
time.</p>

<p>RESOLUTION INTERVAL In order to get RRDtool to fetch
anything other than the finest resolution RRA both the start
and end time must be specified on boundaries that are
multiples of the desired resolution. Consider the following
example:</p>

<p>rrdtool create subdata.rrd -s 10 DS:ds0:GAUGE:300:0:U
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:30:3600 RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:90:1200
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:360:1200 RRA:MAX:0.5:360:1200
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:8640:600 RRA:MAX:0.5:8640:600</p>

<p>This RRD collects data every 10 seconds and stores its
averages over 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day, as
well as the maxima for 1 hour and 1 day.</p>

<p>Consider now that you want to fetch the 15 minute
average data for the last hour. You might try</p>

<p>rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd AVERAGE -r 900 -s -1h</p>

<p>However, this will almost always result in a time series
that is NOT in the 15 minute RRA. Therefore, the highest
resolution RRA, i.e. 5 minute averages, will be chosen which
in this case is not what you want.</p>

<p>Hence, make sure that</p>

<p>1. both start and end time are a multiple of 900</p>

<p>2. both start and end time are within the desired
RRA</p>

<p>So, if time now is called &quot;t&quot;, do</p>

<p>end time == int(t/900)*900, start time == end time -
1hour, resolution == 900.</p>

<p>Using the bash shell, this could look be:</p>

<p>TIME=$(date +%s) RRDRES=900 rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd
AVERAGE -r $RRDRES -e $(($TIME/$RRDRES*$RRDRES)) -s e-1h</p>

<p>Or in Perl:</p>

<p>perl -e &rsquo;$ctime = time; $rrdres = 900; system
&quot;rrdtool fetch subdata.rrd AVERAGE -r $rrdres -e
@{[int($ctime/$rrdres)*$rrdres]} -s e-1h&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p>AT-STYLE TIME SPECIFICATION Apart from the traditional
Seconds since epoch, RRDtool does also understand at-style
time specification. The specification is called
&quot;at-style&quot; after the Unix command at(1) that has
moderately complex ways to specify time to run your job at a
certain date and time. The at-style specification consists
of two parts: the TIME REFERENCE specification and the TIME
OFFSET specification.</p>

<p>TIME REFERENCE SPECIFICATION The time reference
specification is used, well, to establish a reference moment
in time (to which the time offset is then applied to). When
present, it should come first, when omitted, it defaults to
now. On its own part, time reference consists of a
time-of-day reference (which should come first, if present)
and a day reference.</p>

<p>The time-of-day can be specified as HH:MM, HH.MM, or
just HH. You can suffix it with am or pm or use 24-hours
clock. Some special times of day are understood as well,
including midnight (00:00), noon (12:00) and British teatime
(16:00).</p>

<p>The day can be specified as month-name day-of-the-month
and optional a 2- or 4-digit year number (e.g. March 8
1999). Alternatively, you can use day-of-week-name (e.g.
Monday), or one of the words: yesterday, today, tomorrow.
You can also specify the day as a full date in several
numerical formats, including MM/DD/[YY]YY, DD.MM.[YY]YY, or
YYYYMMDD.</p>

<p>NOTE1: this is different from the original at(1)
behavior, where a single-number date is interpreted as
MMDD[YY]YY.</p>

<p>NOTE2: if you specify the day in this way, the
time-of-day is REQUIRED as well.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use the words now, start, or end as
your time reference. Now refers to the current moment (and
is also the default time reference). Start (end) can be used
to specify a time relative to the start (end) time for those
tools that use these categories (rrdfetch, rrdgraph).</p>

<p>Month and day of the week names can be used in their
naturally abbreviated form (e.g., Dec for December, Sun for
Sunday, etc.). The words now, start, end can be abbreviated
as n, s, e.</p>

<p>TIME OFFSET SPECIFICATION The time offset specification
is used to add/subtract certain time intervals to/from the
time reference moment. It consists of a sign (+ or -) and an
amount. The following time units can be used to specify the
amount: years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or
seconds. These units can be used in singular or plural form,
and abbreviated naturally or to a single letter (e.g.
+3days, -1wk, -3y). Several time units can be combined
(e.g., -5mon1w2d) or concatenated (e.g., -5h45min =
-5h-45min = -6h+15min = -7h+1h30m-15min, etc.)</p>

<p>NOTE3: If you specify time offset in days, weeks,
months, or years, you will end with the time offset that may
vary depending on your time reference, because all those
time units have no single well defined time interval value
(1 year contains either 365 or 366 days, 1 month is 28 to 31
days long, and even 1 day may be not equal to 24 hours twice
a year, when DST-related clock adjustments take place). To
cope with this, when you use days, weeks, months, or years
as your time offset units your time reference date is
adjusted accordingly without too much further effort to
ensure anything about it (in the hope that mktime(3) will
take care of this later). This may lead to some surprising
(or even invalid!) results, e.g. May 31 -1month = Apr 31
(meaningless) = May 1 (after mktime(3) normalization); in
the EET timezone 3:30am Mar 29 1999 -1 day yields 3:30am Mar
28 1999 (Sunday) which is an invalid time/date combination
(because of 3am -&gt; 4am DST forward clock adjustment, see
the below example).</p>

<p>In contrast, hours, minutes, and seconds are well
defined time intervals, and these are guaranteed to always
produce time offsets exactly as specified (e.g. for EET
timezone, 8:00 Mar 27 1999 +2 days = 8:00 Mar 29 1999, but
since there is 1-hour DST forward clock adjustment that
occurs around 3:00 Mar 28 1999, the actual time interval
between 8:00 Mar 27 1999 and 8:00 Mar 29 1999 equals 47
hours; on the other hand, 8:00 Mar 27 1999 +48 hours = 9:00
Mar 29 1999, as expected)</p>

<p>NOTE4: The single-letter abbreviation for both months
and minutes is m. To disambiguate them, the parser tries to
read your mind :) by applying the following two
heuristics:</p>

<p>1. If m is used in context of (i.e. right after the)
years, months, weeks, or days it is assumed to mean months,
while in the context of hours, minutes, and seconds it means
minutes. (e.g., in -1y6m or +3w1m m is interpreted as
months, while in -3h20m or +5s2m m the parser decides for
minutes).</p>

<p>2. Out of context (i.e. right after the + or - sign) the
meaning of m is guessed from the number it directly follows.
Currently, if the numbers absolute value is below 25 it is
assumed that m means months, otherwise it is treated as
minutes. (e.g., -25m == -25 minutes, while +24m == +24
months)</p>

<p>Final NOTES: Time specification is case-insensitive.
Whitespace can be inserted freely or omitted altogether.
There are, however, cases when whitespace is required (e.g.,
midnight Thu). In this case you should either quote the
whole phrase to prevent it from being taken apart by your
shell or use _ (underscore) or , (comma) which also count as
whitespace (e.g., midnight_Thu or midnight,Thu).</p>

<p>TIME SPECIFICATION EXAMPLES Oct 12 -- October 12 this
year</p>

<p>-1month or -1m -- current time of day, only a month
before (may yield surprises, see NOTE3 above).</p>

<p>noon yesterday -3hours -- yesterday morning; can also be
specified as 9am-1day.</p>

<p>23:59 31.12.1999 -- 1 minute to the year 2000.</p>

<p>12/31/99 11:59pm -- 1 minute to the year 2000 for
imperialists.</p>

<p>12am 01/01/01 -- start of the new millennium</p>

<p>end-3weeks or e-3w -- 3 weeks before end time (may be
used as start time specification).</p>

<p>start+6hours or s+6h -- 6 hours after start time (may be
used as end time specification).</p>

<p>931225537 -- 18:45 July 5th, 1999 (yes, seconds since
1970 are valid as well).</p>

<p>19970703 12:45 -- 12:45 July 3th, 1997 (my favorite, and
its even got an ISO number (8601)).</p>
