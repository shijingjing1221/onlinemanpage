<p>NAME pnmsplit - split a multi-image PNM file into
multiple single-image files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>Starting with Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005), pnmsplit is
obsolete. Use pamsplit(1)instead.</p>

<p>pamsplit is backward compatible with pnmsplit. You can
use the pam- split manual for pnmsplit as long as you ignore
features that were added after Netpbm 10.30.</p>
