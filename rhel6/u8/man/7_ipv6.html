<p>IPV6(7) Linux Programmer s Manual IPV6(7)</p>

<p>NAME ipv6, AF_INET6 - Linux IPv6 protocol
implementation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</p>

<p>tcp6_socket = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
raw6_socket = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, protocol);
udp6_socket = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, protocol);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux 2.2 optionally implements the Internet
Protocol, version 6. This man page contains a description of
the IPv6 basic API as implemented by the Linux kernel and
glibc 2.1. The interface is based on the BSD sockets
interface; see socket(7).</p>

<p>The IPv6 API aims to be mostly compatible with the IPv4
API (see ip(7)). Only differences are described in this man
page.</p>

<p>To bind an AF_INET6 socket to any process, the local
address should be copied from the in6addr_any variable which
has in6_addr type. In static initializations,
IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT may also be used, which expands to a
constant expression. Both of them are in network byte
order.</p>

<p>The IPv6 loopback address (::1) is available in the
global in6addr_loopback variable. For initializations,
IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT should be used.</p>

<p>IPv4 connections can be handled with the v6 API by using
the v4-mapped- on-v6 address type; thus a program only needs
to support this API type to support both protocols. This is
handled transparently by the address handling functions in
the C library.</p>

<p>IPv4 and IPv6 share the local port space. When you get
an IPv4 connec- tion or packet to a IPv6 socket, its source
address will be mapped to v6 and it will be mapped to
v6.</p>

<p>Address Format struct sockaddr_in6 { sa_family_t
sin6_family; /* AF_INET6 */ in_port_t sin6_port; /* port
number */ uint32_t sin6_flowinfo; /* IPv6 flow information
*/ struct in6_addr sin6_addr; /* IPv6 address */ uint32_t
sin6_scope_id; /* Scope ID (new in 2.4) */ };</p>

<p>struct in6_addr { unsigned char s6_addr[16]; /* IPv6
address */ };</p>

<p>sin6_family is always set to AF_INET6; sin6_port is the
protocol port (see sin_port in ip(7)); sin6_flowinfo is the
IPv6 flow identifier; sin6_addr is the 128-bit IPv6 address.
sin6_scope_id is an ID depend- ing on the scope of the
address. It is new in Linux 2.4. Linux only supports it for
link scope addresses, in that case sin6_scope_id con- tains
the interface index (see netdevice(7))</p>

<p>IPv6 supports several address types: unicast to address
a single host, multicast to address a group of hosts,
anycast to address the nearest member of a group of hosts
(not implemented in Linux), IPv4-on-IPv6 to address a IPv4
host, and other reserved address types.</p>

<p>The address notation for IPv6 is a group of 16 2-digit
hexadecimal num- bers, separated with a &rsquo;:&rsquo;.
&quot;::&quot; stands for a string of 0 bits. Spe- cial
addresses are ::1 for loopback and ::FFFF:&lt;IPv4
address&gt; for IPv4-mapped-on-IPv6.</p>

<p>The port space of IPv6 is shared with IPv4.</p>

<p>Socket Options IPv6 supports some protocol-specific
socket options that can be set with setsockopt(2) and read
with getsockopt(2). The socket option level for IPv6 is
IPPROTO_IPV6. A boolean integer flag is zero when it is
false, otherwise true.</p>

<p>IPV6_ADDRFORM Turn an AF_INET6 socket into a socket of a
different address family. Only AF_INET is currently
supported for that. It is only allowed for IPv6 sockets that
are connected and bound to a v4-mapped-on-v6 address. The
argument is a pointer to an inte- ger containing AF_INET.
This is useful to pass v4-mapped sock- ets as file
descriptors to programs that dont know how to deal with the
IPv6 API.</p>

<p>IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, IPV6_DROP_MEMBERSHIP Control
membership in multicast groups. Argument is a pointer to a
struct ipv6_mreq structure.</p>

<p>IPV6_MTU Set the MTU to be used for the socket. The MTU
is limited by the device MTU or the path mtu when path mtu
discovery is enabled. Argument is a pointer to integer.</p>

<p>IPV6_MTU_DISCOVER Control path mtu discovery on the
socket. See IP_MTU_DISCOVER in ip(7) for details.</p>

<p>IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS Set the multicast hop limit for the
socket. Argument is a pointer to an integer. -1 in the value
means use the route default, otherwise it should be between
0 and 255.</p>

<p>IPV6_MULTICAST_IF Set the device for outgoing multicast
packets on the socket. This is only allowed for SOCK_DGRAM
and SOCK_RAW socket. The argument is a pointer to an
interface index (see netdevice(7)) in an integer.</p>

<p>IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP Control whether the socket sees
multicast packets that it has send itself. Argument is a
pointer to boolean.</p>

<p>IPV6_PKTINFO Set delivery of the IPV6_PKTINFO control
message on incoming datagrams. Only allowed for SOCK_DGRAM
or SOCK_RAW sockets. Argument is a pointer to a boolean
value in an integer.</p>

<p>IPV6_RTHDR, IPV6_AUTHHDR, IPV6_DSTOPS, IPV6_HOPOPTS,
IPV6_FLOWINFO, IPV6_HOPLIMIT Set delivery of control
messages for incoming datagrams contain- ing extension
headers from the received packet. IPV6_RTHDR de- livers the
routing header, IPV6_AUTHHDR delivers the authentica- tion
header, IPV6_DSTOPTS delivers the destination options,
IPV6_HOPOPTS delivers the hop options, IPV6_FLOWINFO
delivers an integer containing the flow ID, IPV6_HOPLIMIT
delivers an inte- ger containing the hop count of the
packet. The control mes- sages have the same type as the
socket option. All these header options can also be set for
outgoing packets by putting the ap- propriate control
message into the control buffer of sendmsg(2). Only allowed
for SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_RAW sockets. Argument is a pointer to
a boolean value.</p>

<p>IPV6_RECVERR Control receiving of asynchronous error
options. See IP_RECVERR in ip(7) for details. Argument is a
pointer to boolean.</p>

<p>IPV6_ROUTER_ALERT Pass forwarded packets containing a
router alert hop-by-hop op- tion to this socket. Only
allowed for SOCK_RAW sockets. The tapped packets are not
forwarded by the kernel, it is the users responsibility to
send them out again. Argument is a pointer to an integer. A
positive integer indicates a router alert option value to
intercept. Packets carrying a router alert option with a
value field containing this integer will be delivered to the
socket. A negative integer disables delivery of packets with
router alert options to this socket.</p>

<p>IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS Set the unicast hop limit for the
socket. Argument is a pointer to an integer. -1 in the value
means use the route default, otherwise it should be between
0 and 255.</p>

<p>IPV6_V6ONLY (since Linux 2.4.21 and 2.6) If this flag is
set to true (non-zero), then the socket is re- stricted to
sending and receiving IPv6 packets only. In this case, an
IPv4 and an IPv6 application can bind to a single port at
the same time.</p>

<p>If this flag is set to false (zero), then the socket can
be used to send and receive packets to and from an IPv6
address or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.</p>

<p>The argument is a pointer to a boolean value in an
integer.</p>

<p>The default value for this flag is defined by the
contents of the file /proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only. The
default value for that file is 0 (false).</p>

<p>VERSIONS The older libinet6 libc5 based IPv6 API
implementation for Linux is not described here and may vary
in details.</p>

<p>Linux 2.4 will break binary compatibility for the
sockaddr_in6 for 64-bit hosts by changing the alignment of
in6_addr and adding an addi- tional sin6_scope_id field. The
kernel interfaces stay compatible, but a program including
sockaddr_in6 or in6_addr into other structures may not be.
This is not a problem for 32-bit hosts like i386.</p>

<p>The sin6_flowinfo field is new in Linux 2.4. It is
transparently passed/read by the kernel when the passed
address length contains it. Some programs that pass a longer
address buffer and then check the out- going address length
may break.</p>

<p>NOTES The sockaddr_in6 structure is bigger than the
generic sockaddr. Pro- grams that assume that all address
types can be stored safely in a struct sockaddr need to be
changed to use struct sockaddr_storage for that instead.</p>

<p>BUGS The IPv6 extended API as in RFC 2292 is currently
only partly imple- mented; although the 2.2 kernel has near
complete support for receiving options, the macros for
generating IPv6 options are missing in glibc 2.1.</p>

<p>IPSec support for EH and AH headers is missing.</p>

<p>Flow label management is not complete and not documented
here.</p>

<p>This man page is not complete.</p>
