<p>NAME dumpcap - Dump network traffic</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dumpcap [ -a &lt;capture autostop condition&gt;
] ... [ -b &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt;] ... [ -B
&lt;capture buffer size&gt; ] [ -c &lt;capture packet
count&gt; ] [ -d ] [ -D ] [ -f &lt;capture filter&gt; ] [ -h
] [ -i &lt;capture interface&gt;|- ] [ -I ] [ -L ] [ -M ] [

-S ] [ -v ] [ -w &lt;outfile&gt; ] [ -y &lt;capture link
type&gt; ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Dumpcap is a network traffic dump tool. It
lets you capture packet data from a live network and write
the packets to a file. Dumpcaps default capture file format
is pcap-ng format. When the -P option is specified, the
output file is written in the libpcap format.</p>

<p>Without any options set it will use the pcap library to
capture traffic from the first available network interface
and writes the received raw packet data, along with the
packets time stamps into a libpcap file.</p>

<p>If the -w option is not specified, Dumpcap writes to a
newly created libpcap file with a randomly chosen name. If
the -w option is specified, Dumpcap writes to the file
specified by that option.</p>

<p>Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library. The
capture filter syntax follows the rules of the pcap
library.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a &lt;capture autostop condition&gt; Specify a
criterion that specifies when Dumpcap is to stop writing to
a capture file. The criterion is of the form test:value,
where test is one of:</p>

<p>duration:value Stop writing to a capture file after
value seconds have elapsed.</p>

<p>filesize:value Stop writing to a capture file after it
reaches a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024
bytes). If this option is used together with the -b option,
dumpcap will stop writing to the current capture file and
switch to the next one if filesize is reached.</p>

<p>files:value Stop writing to capture files after value
number of files were written.</p>

<p>-b &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt; Cause Dumpcap to
run in &quot;multiple files&quot; mode. In &quot;multiple
files&quot; mode, Dumpcap will write to several capture
files. When the first capture file fills up, Dumpcap will
switch writing to the next file and so on.</p>

<p>The created filenames are based on the filename given
with the -w option, the number of the file and on the
creation date and time, e.g.
outfile_00001_20050604120117.pcap,
outfile_00002_20050604120523.pcap, ...</p>

<p>With the files option its also possible to form a
&quot;ring buffer&quot;. This will fill up new files until
the number of files specified, at which point Dumpcap will
discard the data in the first file and start writing to that
file and so on. If the files option is not set, new files
filled up until one of the capture stop conditions match (or
until the disk is full).</p>

<p>The criterion is of the form key:value, where key is one
of:</p>

<p>duration:value switch to the next file after value
seconds have elapsed, even if the current file is not
completely filled up.</p>

<p>filesize:value switch to the next file after it reaches
a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024
bytes).</p>

<p>files:value begin again with the first file after value
number of files were written (form a ring buffer). This
value must be less than 100000. Caution should be used when
using large numbers of files: some filesystems do not handle
many files in a single directory well. The files criterion
requires either duration or filesize to be specified to
control when to go to the next file. It should be noted that
each -b parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify
two criterion, each must be preceded by the -b option.</p>

<p>Example: -b filesize:1024 -b files:5 results in a ring
buffer of five files of size one megabyte.</p>

<p>-B &lt;capture buffer size&gt; Set capture buffer size
(in MB, default is 1MB). This is used by the the capture
driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written
to disk. If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try
to increase this size. Note that, while Dumpcap attempts to
set the buffer size to 1MB by default, and can be told to
set it to a larger value, the system or interface on which
youre capturing might silently limit the capture buffer size
to a lower value or raise it to a higher value.</p>

<p>This is available on UNIX systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or
later and on Windows. It is not available on UNIX systems
with earlier versions of libpcap.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
capture buffer size. If used after an -i option, it sets the
capture buffer size for the interface specified by the last
-i option occurring before this option. If the capture
buffer size is not set specifically, the default capture
buffer size is used if provided.</p>

<p>-c &lt;capture packet count&gt; Set the maximum number
of packets to read when capturing live data.</p>

<p>-d Dump the code generated for the capture filter in a
human-readable form, and exit.</p>

<p>-D Print a list of the interfaces on which Dumpcap can
capture, and exit. For each network interface, a number and
an interface name, possibly followed by a text description
of the interface, is printed. The interface name or the
number can be supplied to the -i option to specify an
interface on which to capture.</p>

<p>This can be useful on systems that dont have a command
to list them (e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking
ifconfig -a); the number can be useful on Windows 2000 and
later systems, where the interface name is a somewhat
complex string.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;can capture&quot; means that Dumpcap was
able to open that device to do a live capture. Depending on
your system you may need to run dumpcap from an account with
special privileges (for example, as root) to be able to
capture network traffic. If &quot;dumpcap -D&quot; is not
run from such an account, it will not list any
interfaces.</p>

<p>-f &lt;capture filter&gt; Set the capture filter
expression.</p>

<p>The entire filter expression must be specified as a
single argument (which means that if it contains spaces, it
must be quoted).</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
capture filter expression. If used after an -i option, it
sets the capture filter expression for the interface
specified by the last -i option occurring before this
option. If the capture filter expression is not set
specifically, the default capture filter expression is used
if provided.</p>

<p>-h Print the version and options and exits.</p>

<p>-i &lt;capture interface&gt;|- Set the name of the
network interface or pipe to use for live packet
capture.</p>

<p>Network interface names should match one of the names
listed in &quot;dumpcap -D&quot; (described above); a
number, as reported by &quot;dumpcap -D&quot;, can also be
used. If youre using UNIX, &quot;netstat -i&quot; or
&quot;ifconfig -a&quot; might also work to list interface
names, although not all versions of UNIX support the -a
option to ifconfig.</p>

<p>If no interface is specified, Dumpcap searches the list
of interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if
there are any non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the
first loopback interface if there are no non-loopback
interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all, Dumpcap
reports an error and doesnt start the capture.</p>

<p>Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named
pipe) or - to read data from the standard input. Data read
from pipes must be in standard libpcap format.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. When capturing
from multiple interfaces, the capture file will be saved in
pcap-ng format.</p>

<p>Note: the Win32 version of Dumpcap doesn t support
capturing from pipes or stdin!</p>

<p>-I Put the interface in &quot;monitor mode&quot;; this
is supported only on IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and
supported only on some operating systems.</p>

<p>Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate
from the network with which its associated, so that you will
not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter.
This could prevent accessing files on a network server, or
resolving host names or network addresses, if you are
capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another
network with another adapter.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it enables the monitor
mode for all interfaces. If used after an -i option, it
enables the monitor mode for the interface specified by the
last -i option occurring before this option.</p>

<p>-L List the data link types supported by the interface
and exit. The reported link types can be used for the -y
option.</p>

<p>-M When used with -D, -L or -S, print machine-readable
output. The machine-readable output is intended to be read
by Wireshark and TShark; its format is subject to change
from release to release.</p>

<p>-n Save files as pcap-ng. This is the default.</p>

<p>-p Dont put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note
that the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some
other reason; hence, -p cannot be used to ensure that the
only traffic that is captured is traffic sent to or from the
machine on which Dumpcap is running, broadcast traffic, and
multicast traffic to addresses received by that machine.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, no interface will be put
into the promiscuous mode. If used after an -i option, the
interface specified by the last -i option occurring before
this option will not be put into the promiscuous mode.</p>

<p>-P Save files as pcap instead of the default pcap-ng. In
situations that require pcap-ng, such as capturing from
multiple interfaces, this option will be overridden.</p>

<p>-q When capturing packets, dont display the continuous
count of packets captured that is normally shown when saving
a capture to a file; instead, just display, at the end of
the capture, a count of packets captured. On systems that
support the SIGINFO signal, such as various BSDs, you can
cause the current count to be displayed by typing your
&quot;status&quot; character (typically control-T, although
it might be set to &quot;disabled&quot; by default on at
least some BSDs, so youd have to explicitly set it to use
it).</p>

<p>-s &lt;capture snaplen&gt; Set the default snapshot
length to use when capturing live data. No more than snaplen
bytes of each network packet will be read into memory, or
saved to disk. A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length of
65535, so that the full packet is captured; this is the
default.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
snapshot length. If used after an -i option, it sets the
snapshot length for the interface specified by the last -i
option occurring before this option. If the snapshot length
is not set specifically, the default snapshot length is used
if provided.</p>

<p>-S Print statistics for each interface once every
second.</p>

<p>-v Print the version and exit.</p>

<p>-w &lt;outfile&gt; Write raw packet data to outfile.</p>

<p>NOTE: The usage of &quot;-&quot; for stdout is not
allowed here!</p>

<p>-y &lt;capture link type&gt; Set the data link type to
use while capturing packets. The values reported by -L are
the values that can be used.</p>

<p>This option can occur multiple times. If used before the
first occurrence of the -i option, it sets the default
capture link type. If used after an -i option, it sets the
capture link type for the interface specified by the last -i
option occurring before this option. If the capture link
type is not set specifically, the default capture link type
is used if provided.</p>
