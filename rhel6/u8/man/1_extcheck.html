<p>NAME extcheck - Detects version conflicts between a
target Java Archive (JAR) file and currently installed
extension JAR files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS extcheck [options] targetfile.jar</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>targetfile.jar The target JAR file against which the
currently installed extension JAR files are compared to
detect version conflicts.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The extcheck command checks a specified JAR
file for title and version conflicts with any extensions
installed in the Java SE SDK. Before installing an
extension, you can use this utility to see whether the same
or a more recent version of the extension is already
installed.</p>

<p>The extcheck command compares the Specification-title
and Specification-version headers in the manifest of the
targetfile.jar file against the corresponding headers in all
JAR files currently installed in the extension directory. By
default, the extension directory is jre/lib/ext on Oracle
Solaris and jriext on Windows. The extcheck command compares
version numbers in the same way as the
java.lang.Package.isCompatibleWith method.</p>

<p>If no conflict is detected, then the return code is
0.</p>

<p>If the manifest of any JAR file in the extensions
directory has the same Specification-title and the same or a
newer Specification-version number, then a non-zero error
code is returned. A non-zero error code is also returned
when targetfile.jar does not have the Specification- title
or Specification-version attributes in its manifest
file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -verbose Lists JAR files in the extension
directory as they are checked. Additionally, manifest
attributes of the target JAR file and any conflicting JAR
files are also reported.</p>

<p>-Joption Passes option to the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM), where option is one of the options described on the
reference page for the Java launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m
sets the startup memory to 48 MB. See java(1).</p>
