<p>NAME rm - remove files or directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rm [OPTION]... FILE...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the GNU version
of rm. rm removes each specified file. By default, it does
not remove directories.</p>

<p>If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and
there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or
--recursive are given, then rm prompts the user for whether
to proceed with the entire operation. If the response is not
affirmative, the entire command is aborted.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a
terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or the
-i or --interac- tive=always option is given, rm prompts the
user for whether to remove the file. If the response is not
affirmative, the file is skipped.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).</p>

<p>-f, --force ignore nonexistent files, never prompt</p>

<p>-i prompt before every removal</p>

<p>-I prompt once before removing more than three files, or
when removing recursively. Less intrusive than -i, while
still giv- ing protection against most mistakes</p>

<p>--interactive[=WHEN] prompt according to WHEN: never,
once (-I), or always (-i). Without WHEN, prompt always</p>

<p>--one-file-system when removing a hierarchy recursively,
skip any directory that is on a file system different from
that of the corresponding command line argument</p>

<p>--no-preserve-root do not treat / specially</p>

<p>--preserve-root do not remove / (default)</p>

<p>-r, -R, --recursive remove directories and their
contents recursively</p>

<p>-v, --verbose explain what is being done</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>By default, rm does not remove directories. Use the
--recursive (-r or -R) option to remove each listed
directory, too, along with all of its contents.</p>

<p>To remove a file whose name starts with a -, for example
-foo, use one of these commands:</p>

<p>rm -- -foo</p>

<p>rm ./-foo</p>

<p>Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it is usually
possible to recover the contents of that file. If you want
more assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable,
consider using shred.</p>
