USB_SET_DEVICE_STATE(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_set_device_state - change a device&acute;s
current state (usbcore, hcds)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void usb_set_device_state(struct usb_device *
udev, enum usb_device_state new_state);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS udev pointer to device whose state should be
changed</p>

<p>new_state new state value to be stored</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION udev-&gt;state is _not_ fully protected by
the device lock. Although most transitions are made only
while holding the lock, the state can can change to
USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED at almost any time. This is so that
devices can be marked as disconnected as soon as possible,
without having to wait for any semaphores to be released. As
a result, all changes to any device&acute;s state must be
protected by the device_state_lock spinlock.</p>

<p>Once a device has been added to the device tree, all
changes to its state should be made using this routine. The
state should _not_ be set directly.</p>

<p>If udev-&gt;state is already USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED then
no change is made. Otherwise udev-&gt;state is set to
new_state, and if new_state is USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED then
all of udev&acute;s descendants&acute; states are also set
to USB_STATE_NOTATTACHED.</p>
