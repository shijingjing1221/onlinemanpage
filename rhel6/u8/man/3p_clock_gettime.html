<p>CLOCK_GETRES(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
CLOCK_GETRES(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME clock_getres, clock_gettime, clock_settime - clock
and timer functions (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int clock_getres(clockid_t clock_id, struct timespec
*res); int clock_gettime(clockid_t clock_id, struct timespec
*tp); int clock_settime(clockid_t clock_id, const struct
timespec *tp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The clock_getres() function shall return the
resolution of any clock. Clock resolutions are
implementation-defined and cannot be set by a process. If
the argument res is not NULL, the resolution of the speci-
fied clock shall be stored in the location pointed to by
res. If res is NULL, the clock resolution is not returned.
If the time argument of clock_settime() is not a multiple of
res, then the value is truncated to a multiple of res.</p>

<p>The clock_gettime() function shall return the current
value tp for the specified clock, clock_id.</p>

<p>The clock_settime() function shall set the specified
clock, clock_id, to the value specified by tp. Time values
that are between two consecu- tive non-negative integer
multiples of the resolution of the specified clock shall be
truncated down to the smaller multiple of the resolu-
tion.</p>

<p>A clock may be system-wide (that is, visible to all
processes) or per- process (measuring time that is
meaningful only within a process). All implementations shall
support a clock_id of CLOCK_REALTIME as defined in
&lt;time.h&gt;. This clock represents the realtime clock for
the system. For this clock, the values returned by
clock_gettime() and specified by clock_settime() represent
the amount of time (in seconds and nanosec- onds) since the
Epoch. An implementation may also support additional clocks.
The interpretation of time values for these clocks is
unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>If the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock is set via
clock_settime(), the new value of the clock shall be used to
determine the time of expi- ration for absolute time
services based upon the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. This applies
to the time at which armed absolute timers expire. If the
absolute time requested at the invocation of such a time
service is before the new value of the clock, the time
service shall expire imme- diately as if the clock had
reached the requested time normally.</p>

<p>Setting the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock via
clock_settime() shall have no effect on threads that are
blocked waiting for a relative time service based upon this
clock, including the nanosleep() function; nor on the
expiration of relative timers based upon this clock. Conse-
quently, these time services shall expire when the requested
relative interval elapses, independently of the new or old
value of the clock.</p>

<p>If the Monotonic Clock option is supported, all
implementations shall support a clock_id of CLOCK_MONOTONIC
defined in &lt;time.h&gt;. This clock represents the
monotonic clock for the system. For this clock, the value
returned by clock_gettime() represents the amount of time
(in seconds and nanoseconds) since an unspecified point in
the past (for example, system start-up time, or the Epoch).
This point does not change after system start-up time. The
value of the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock cannot be set via
clock_settime(). This function shall fail if it is invoked
with a clock_id argument of CLOCK_MONOTONIC.</p>

<p>The effect of setting a clock via clock_settime() on
armed per-process timers associated with a clock other than
CLOCK_REALTIME is implementa- tion-defined.</p>

<p>If the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock is set via
clock_settime(), the new value of the clock shall be used to
determine the time at which the system shall awaken a thread
blocked on an absolute clock_nanosleep() call based upon the
CLOCK_REALTIME clock. If the absolute time requested at the
invocation of such a time service is before the new value of
the clock, the call shall return immediately as if the clock
had reached the requested time normally.</p>

<p>Setting the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock via
clock_settime() shall have no effect on any thread that is
blocked on a relative clock_nanosleep() call. Consequently,
the call shall return when the requested relative interval
elapses, independently of the new or old value of the
clock.</p>

<p>The appropriate privilege to set a particular clock is
implementation- defined.</p>

<p>If _POSIX_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall
support clock ID values obtained by invoking
clock_getcpuclockid(), which represent the CPU-time clock of
a given process. Implementations shall also support the
special clockid_t value CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, which
represents the CPU-time clock of the calling process when
invoking one of the clock_*() or timer_*() functions. For
these clock IDs, the values returned by clock_gettime() and
specified by clock_settime() represent the amount of
execution time of the process associated with the clock.
Changing the value of a CPU-time clock via clock_settime()
shall have no effect on the behavior of the sporadic server
scheduling policy (see Scheduling Policies ).</p>

<p>If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, implementations
shall support clock ID values obtained by invoking
pthread_getcpuclockid(), which represent the CPU-time clock
of a given thread. Implementations shall also support the
special clockid_t value CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, which
represents the CPU-time clock of the calling thread when
invoking one of the clock_*() or timer_*() functions. For
these clock IDs, the val- ues returned by clock_gettime()
and specified by clock_settime() shall represent the amount
of execution time of the thread associated with the clock.
Changing the value of a CPU-time clock via clock_settime()
shall have no effect on the behavior of the sporadic server
scheduling policy (see Scheduling Policies ).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE A return value of 0 shall indicate that the
call succeeded. A return value of -1 shall indicate that an
error occurred, and errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The clock_getres(), clock_gettime(), and
clock_settime() functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The clock_id argument does not specify a known
clock.</p>

<p>The clock_settime() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The tp argument to clock_settime() is outside the
range for the given clock ID.</p>

<p>EINVAL The tp argument specified a nanosecond value less
than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the clock_id argument is
CLOCK_MONOTONIC.</p>

<p>The clock_settime() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EPERM The requesting process does not have the
appropriate privilege to set the specified clock.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are part of the Timers
option and need not be available on all implementations.</p>

<p>Note that the absolute value of the monotonic clock is
meaningless (because its origin is arbitrary), and thus
there is no need to set it. Furthermore, realtime
applications can rely on the fact that the value of this
clock is never set and, therefore, that time intervals
measured with this clock will not be affected by calls to
clock_settime().</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
