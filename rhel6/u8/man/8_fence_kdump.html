<p>NAME fence_kdump - fencing agent for use with kdump
crash recovery service</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fence_kdump [OPTIONS]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fence_kdump is an I/O fencing agent to be
used with the kdump crash recovery service. When the
fence_kdump agent is invoked, it will listen for a message
from the failed node that acknowledges that the failed node
it executing the kdump crash kernel. Note that fence_kdump
is not a replacement for traditional fencing methods. The
fence_kdump agent can only detect that a node has entered
the kdump crash recovery ser- vice. This allows the kdump
crash recovery service complete without being preempted by
traditional power fencing methods.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n, --nodename=NODE Name or IP address of node
to be fenced. This option is required for the
&quot;off&quot; action. (default: none)</p>

<p>-p, --ipport=PORT IP port number that the fence_kdump
agent will use to listen for messages. (default: 7410)</p>

<p>-f, --family=FAMILY IP network family. Force the
fence_kdump agent to use a specific family. The value for
FAMILY can be &quot;auto&quot;, &quot;ipv4&quot;, or
&quot;ipv6&quot;. (default: auto)</p>

<p>-o, --action=ACTION Fencing action to perform. The value
for ACTION can be either &quot;off&quot; or
&quot;metadata&quot;. (default: off)</p>

<p>-t, --timeout=TIMEOUT Numer of seconds to wait for
message from failed node. If no message is received within
TIMEOUT seconds, the fence_kdump agent returns failure.
(default: 60)</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Print verbose output.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version and exit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print usage and exit.</p>

<p>STDIN PARAMETERS These parameters are passed to
fence_kdump via standard input if no command-line options
are present.</p>

<p>nodename=NODE Name or IP address of node to be fenced.
This option is required for the &quot;off&quot; action.
(default: none)</p>

<p>ipport=PORT IP port number that the fence_kdump agent
will use to listen for messages. (default: 7410)</p>

<p>action=ACTION Fencing action to perform. The value for
ACTION can be either &quot;off&quot; or
&quot;metadata&quot;. (default: off)</p>

<p>timeout=TIMEOUT Numer of seconds to wait for message
from failed node. If no message is received within TIMEOUT
seconds, the fence_kdump agent returns failure. (default:
60)</p>

<p>ACTIONS off Listen for message from failed node that
acknowledges node has entered kdump crash recovery service.
If a valid message is received from the failed node, the
node is considered to be fenced and the agent returns
success. Failure to receive a valid message from the failed
node in the given timeout period results in fencing
failure.</p>

<p>metadata Print XML metadata to standard output.</p>
