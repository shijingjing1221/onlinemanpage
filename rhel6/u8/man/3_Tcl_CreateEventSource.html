_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION The interfaces described here are used to
customize the Tcl event loop. The two most common
customizations are to add new sources of events and to merge
Tcls event loop with some other event loop, such as one pro-
vided by an application in which Tcl is embedded. Each of
these tasks is described in a separate section below.</p>

<p>The procedures in this manual entry are the building
blocks out of which the Tcl event notifier is constructed.
The event notifier is the lowest layer in the Tcl event
mechanism. It consists of three things:</p>

<p>[1] Event sources: these represent the ways in which
events can be generated. For example, there is a timer event
source that implements the Tcl_CreateTimerHandler procedure
and the after command, and there is a file event source that
implements the Tcl_CreateFileHandler procedure on Unix
systems. An event source must work with the notifier to
detect events at the right times, record them on the event
queue, and eventually notify higher-level software that they
have occurred. The procedures Tcl_CreateEventSource,
Tcl_DeleteEventSource, and Tcl_Set- MaxBlockTime,
Tcl_QueueEvent, and Tcl_DeleteEvents are used pri- marily by
event sources.</p>

<p>[2] The event queue: for non-threaded applications,
there is a sin- gle queue for the whole application,
containing events that have been detected but not yet
serviced. Event sources place events onto the queue so that
they may be processed in order at appro- priate times during
the event loop. The event queue guarantees a fair discipline
of event handling, so that no event source can starve the
others. It also allows events to be saved for ser- vicing at
a future time. Threaded applications work in a simi- lar
manner, except that there is a separate event queue for each
thread containing a Tcl interpreter. Tcl_QueueEvent is used
(primarily by event sources) to add events to the event
queue and Tcl_DeleteEvents is used to remove events from the
queue without processing them. In a threaded application,
Tcl_QueueEvent adds an event to the current threads queue,
and Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent adds an event to a queue in a
specific thread.</p>

<p>[3] The event loop: in order to detect and process
events, the application enters a loop that waits for events
to occur, places them on the event queue, and then processes
them. Most applica- tions will do this by calling the
procedure Tcl_DoOneEvent, which is described in a separate
manual entry.</p>

<p>Most Tcl applications need not worry about any of the
internals of the Tcl notifier. However, the notifier now has
enough flexibility to be retargeted either for a new
platform or to use an external event loop (such as the Motif
event loop, when Tcl is embedded in a Motif applica- tion).
The procedures Tcl_WaitForEvent and Tcl_SetTimer are
normally implemented by Tcl, but may be replaced with new
versions to retarget the notifier (the Tcl_InitNotifier,
Tcl_AlertNotifier, Tcl_FinalizeNo- tifier, Tcl_Sleep,
Tcl_CreateFileHandler, and Tcl_DeleteFileHandler must also
be replaced; see CREATING A NEW NOTIFIER below for details).
The procedures Tcl_ServiceAll, Tcl_ServiceEvent,
Tcl_GetServiceMode, and Tcl_SetServiceMode are provided to
help connect Tcl s event loop to an external event loop such
as Motifs.</p>

<p>NOTIFIER BASICS The easiest way to understand how the
notifier works is to consider what happens when
Tcl_DoOneEvent is called. Tcl_DoOneEvent is passed a flags
argument that indicates what sort of events it is OK to
process and also whether or not to block if no events are
ready. Tcl_DoOneEvent does the following things:</p>

<p>[1] Check the event queue to see if it contains any
events that can be serviced. If so, service the first
possible event, remove it from the queue, and return. It
does this by calling Tcl_Ser- viceEvent and passing in the
flags argument.</p>

<p>[2] Prepare to block for an event. To do this,
Tcl_DoOneEvent invokes a setup procedure in each event
source. The event source will perform event-source specific
initialization and possibly call Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime to
limit how long Tcl_Wait- ForEvent will block if no new
events occur.</p>

<p>[3] Call Tcl_WaitForEvent. This procedure is implemented
differ- ently on different platforms; it waits for an event
to occur, based on the information provided by the event
sources. It may cause the application to block if timePtr
specifies an interval other than 0. Tcl_WaitForEvent returns
when something has hap- pened, such as a file becoming
readable or the interval given by timePtr expiring. If there
are no events for Tcl_WaitForEvent to wait for, so that it
would block forever, then it returns immediately and
Tcl_DoOneEvent returns 0.</p>

<p>[4] Call a check procedure in each event source. The
check proce- dure determines whether any events of interest
to this source occurred. If so, the events are added to the
event queue.</p>

<p>[5] Check the event queue to see if it contains any
events that can be serviced. If so, service the first
possible event, remove it from the queue, and return.</p>

<p>[6] See if there are idle callbacks pending. If so,
invoke all of them and return.</p>

<p>[7] Either return 0 to indicate that no events were
ready, or go back to step [2] if blocking was requested by
the caller.</p>

<p>CREATING A NEW EVENT SOURCE An event source consists of
three procedures invoked by the notifier, plus additional C
procedures that are invoked by higher-level code to arrange
for event-driven callbacks. The three procedures called by
the notifier consist of the setup and check procedures
described above, plus an additional procedure that is
invoked when an event is removed from the event queue for
servicing.</p>

<p>The procedure Tcl_CreateEventSource creates a new event
source. Its arguments specify the setup procedure and check
procedure for the event source. SetupProc should match the
following prototype: typedef void Tcl_EventSetupProc(
ClientData clientData, int flags); The clientData argument
will be the same as the clientData argument to
Tcl_CreateEventSource; it is typically used to point to
private infor- mation managed by the event source. The flags
argument will be the same as the flags argument passed to
Tcl_DoOneEvent except that it will never be 0
(Tcl_DoOneEvent replaces 0 with TCL_ALL_EVENTS). Flags
indicates what kinds of events should be considered; if the
bit corre- sponding to this event source is not set, the
event source should return immediately without doing
anything. For example, the file event source checks for the
TCL_FILE_EVENTS bit.</p>

<p>SetupProc s job is to make sure that the application
wakes up when events of the desired type occur. This is
typically done in a plat- form-dependent fashion. For
example, under Unix an event source might call
Tcl_CreateFileHandler; under Windows it might request
notification with a Windows event. For timer-driven event
sources such as timer events or any polled event, the event
source can call Tcl_SetMaxBlock- Time to force the
application to wake up after a specified time even if no
events have occurred. If no event source calls
Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime then Tcl_WaitForEvent will wait as long
as necessary for an event to occur; otherwise, it will only
wait as long as the shortest interval passed to
Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime by one of the event sources. If an event
source knows that it already has events ready to report, it
can request a zero maximum block time. For example, the
setup procedure for the X event source looks to see if there
are events already queued. If there are, it calls
Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime with a 0 block time so that Tcl_Wait-
ForEvent does not block if there is no new data on the X
connection. The timePtr argument to Tcl_WaitForEvent points
to a structure that describes a time interval in seconds and
microseconds: typedef struct Tcl_Time { long sec; long usec;
} Tcl_Time; The usec field should be less than 1000000.</p>

<p>Information provided to Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime is only used
for the next call to Tcl_WaitForEvent; it is discarded after
Tcl_WaitForEvent returns. The next time an event wait is
done each of the event sources setup procedures will be
called again, and they can specify new information for that
event wait.</p>

<p>If the application uses an external event loop rather
than Tcl_DoOneEvent, the event sources may need to call
Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime at other times. For example, if a new
event handler is registered that needs to poll for events,
the event source may call Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime to set the
block time to zero to force the external event loop to call
Tcl. In this case, Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime invokes Tcl_SetTimer
with the shortest interval seen since the last call to
Tcl_DoOneEvent or Tcl_ServiceAll.</p>

<p>In addition to the generic procedure
Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime, other plat- form-specific procedures
may also be available for setupProc, if there is additional
information needed by Tcl_WaitForEvent on that platform. For
example, on Unix systems the Tcl_CreateFileHandler interface
can be used to wait for file events.</p>

<p>The second procedure provided by each event source is
its check procedure, indicated by the checkProc argument to
Tcl_Cre- ateEventSource. CheckProc must match the following
prototype: typedef void Tcl_EventCheckProc( ClientData
clientData, int flags); The arguments to this procedure are
the same as those for setupProc. CheckProc is invoked by
Tcl_DoOneEvent after it has waited for events. Presumably at
least one event source is now prepared to queue an event.
Tcl_DoOneEvent calls each of the event sources in turn, so
they all have a chance to queue any events that are ready.
The check procedure does two things. First, it must see if
any events have triggered. Different event sources do this
in different ways.</p>

<p>If an event source s check procedure detects an
interesting event, it must add the event to Tcls event
queue. To do this, the event source calls Tcl_QueueEvent.
The evPtr argument is a pointer to a dynamically allocated
structure containing the event (see below for more informa-
tion on memory management issues). Each event source can
define its own event structure with whatever information is
relevant to that event source. However, the first element of
the structure must be a struc- ture of type Tcl_Event, and
the address of this structure is used when communicating
between the event source and the rest of the notifier. A
Tcl_Event has the following definition: typedef struct {
Tcl_EventProc *proc; struct Tcl_Event *nextPtr; } Tcl_Event;
The event source must fill in the proc field of the event
before call- ing Tcl_QueueEvent. The nextPtr is used to link
together the events in the queue and should not be modified
by the event source.</p>

<p>An event may be added to the queue at any of three
positions, depending on the position argument to
Tcl_QueueEvent:</p>

<p>TCL_QUEUE_TAIL Add the event at the back of the queue,
so that all other pending events will be serviced first.
This is almost always the right place for new events.</p>

<p>TCL_QUEUE_HEAD Add the event at the front of the queue,
so that it will be serviced before all other queued
events.</p>

<p>TCL_QUEUE_MARK Add the event at the front of the queue,
unless there are other events at the front whose posi- tion
is TCL_QUEUE_MARK; if so, add the new event just after all
other TCL_QUEUE_MARK events. This value of position is used
to insert an ordered sequence of events at the front of the
queue, such as a series of Enter and Leave events
synthesized during a grab or ungrab operation in Tk.</p>

<p>When it is time to handle an event from the queue (steps
1 and 4 above) Tcl_ServiceEvent will invoke the proc
specified in the first queued Tcl_Event structure. Proc must
match the following prototype: typedef int Tcl_EventProc(
Tcl_Event *evPtr, int flags); The first argument to proc is
a pointer to the event, which will be the same as the first
argument to the Tcl_QueueEvent call that added the event to
the queue. The second argument to proc is the flags argument
for the current call to Tcl_ServiceEvent; this is used by
the event source to return immediately if its events are not
relevant.</p>

<p>It is up to proc to handle the event, typically by
invoking one or more Tcl commands or C-level callbacks. Once
the event source has finished handling the event it returns
1 to indicate that the event can be removed from the queue.
If for some reason the event source decides that the event
cannot be handled at this time, it may return 0 to indi-
cate that the event should be deferred for processing later;
in this case Tcl_ServiceEvent will go on to the next event
in the queue and attempt to service it. There are several
reasons why an event source might defer an event. One
possibility is that events of this type are excluded by the
flags argument. For example, the file event source will
always return 0 if the TCL_FILE_EVENTS bit is not set in
flags. Another example of deferring events happens in Tk if
Tk_RestrictEvents has been invoked to defer certain kinds of
window events.</p>

<p>When proc returns 1, Tcl_ServiceEvent will remove the
event from the event queue and free its storage. Note that
the storage for an event must be allocated by the event
source (using Tcl_Alloc or the Tcl macro ckalloc) before
calling Tcl_QueueEvent, but it will be freed by
Tcl_ServiceEvent, not by the event source.</p>

<p>Threaded applications work in a similar manner, except
that there is a separate event queue for each thread
containing a Tcl interpreter. Calling Tcl_QueueEvent in a
multithreaded application adds an event to the current
threads queue. To add an event to another threads queue, use
Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent. Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent accepts as an
argument a Tcl_ThreadId argument, which uniquely identifies
a thread in a Tcl application. To obtain the Tcl_ThreadID
for the current thread, use the Tcl_GetCurrentThread
procedure. (A thread would then need to pass this identifier
to other threads for those threads to be able to add events
to its queue.) After adding an event to another threads
queue, you then typically need to call Tcl_ThreadAlert to
wake up that threads notifier to alert it to the new
event.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteEvents can be used to explicitly remove one or
more events from the event queue. Tcl_DeleteEvents calls
proc for each event in the queue, deleting those for with
the procedure returns 1. Events for which the procedure
returns 0 are left in the queue. Proc should match the
following prototype: typedef int Tcl_EventDeleteProc(
Tcl_Event *evPtr, ClientData clientData); The clientData
argument will be the same as the clientData argument to
Tcl_DeleteEvents; it is typically used to point to private
information managed by the event source. The evPtr will
point to the next event in the queue.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteEventSource deletes an event source. The
setupProc, check- Proc, and clientData arguments must
exactly match those provided to the Tcl_CreateEventSource
for the event source to be deleted. If no such source
exists, Tcl_DeleteEventSource has no effect.</p>

<p>CREATING A NEW NOTIFIER The notifier consists of all the
procedures described in this manual entry, plus
Tcl_DoOneEvent and Tcl_Sleep, which are available on all
platforms, and Tcl_CreateFileHandler and
Tcl_DeleteFileHandler, which are Unix-specific. Most of
these procedures are generic, in that they are the same for
all notifiers. However, none of the procedures are
notifier-dependent: Tcl_InitNotifier, Tcl_AlertNotifier,
Tcl_Final- izeNotifier, Tcl_SetTimer, Tcl_Sleep,
Tcl_WaitForEvent, Tcl_CreateFile- Handler,
Tcl_DeleteFileHandler and Tcl_ServiceModeHook. To support a
new platform or to integrate Tcl with an
application-specific event loop, you must write new versions
of these procedures.</p>

<p>Tcl_InitNotifier initializes the notifier state and
returns a handle to the notifier state. Tcl calls this
procedure when initializing a Tcl interpreter. Similarly,
Tcl_FinalizeNotifier shuts down the notifier, and is called
by Tcl_Finalize when shutting down a Tcl interpreter.</p>

<p>Tcl_WaitForEvent is the lowest-level procedure in the
notifier; it is responsible for waiting for an interesting
event to occur or for a given time to elapse. Before
Tcl_WaitForEvent is invoked, each of the event sources setup
procedure will have been invoked. The timePtr argument to
Tcl_WaitForEvent gives the maximum time to block for an
event, based on calls to Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime made by setup
procedures and on other information (such as the
TCL_DONT_WAIT bit in flags).</p>

<p>Ideally, Tcl_WaitForEvent should only wait for an event
to occur; it should not actually process the event in any
way. Later on, the event sources will process the raw events
and create Tcl_Events on the event queue in their checkProc
procedures. However, on some platforms (such as Windows)
this is not possible; events may be processed in Tcl_Wait-
ForEvent, including queuing Tcl_Events and more (for
example, callbacks for native widgets may be invoked). The
return value from Tcl_Wait- ForEvent must be either 0, 1, or
-1. On platforms such as Windows where events get processed
in Tcl_WaitForEvent, a return value of 1 means that there
may be more events still pending that have not been
processed. This is a sign to the caller that it must call
Tcl_Wait- ForEvent again if it wants all pending events to
be processed. A 0 return value means that calling
Tcl_WaitForEvent again will not have any effect: either this
is a platform where Tcl_WaitForEvent only waits without
doing any event processing, or Tcl_WaitForEvent knows for
sure that there are no additional events to process (e.g. it
returned because the time elapsed). Finally, a return value
of -1 means that the event loop is no longer operational and
the application should probably unwind and terminate. Under
Windows this happens when a WM_QUIT message is received;
under Unix it happens when Tcl_Wait- ForEvent would have
waited forever because there were no active event sources
and the timeout was infinite.</p>

<p>Tcl_AlertNotifier is used in multithreaded applications
to allow any thread to wake up the notifier to alert it to
new events on its queue. Tcl_AlertNotifier requires as an
argument the notifier handle returned by
Tcl_InitNotifier.</p>

<p>If the notifier will be used with an external event
loop, then it must also support the Tcl_SetTimer interface.
Tcl_SetTimer is invoked by Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime whenever the
maximum blocking time has been reduced. Tcl_SetTimer should
arrange for the external event loop to invoke Tcl_ServiceAll
after the specified interval even if no events have
occurred. This interface is needed because Tcl_WaitForEvent
is not invoked when there is an external event loop. If the
notifier will only be used from Tcl_DoOneEvent, then
Tcl_SetTimer need not do any- thing.</p>

<p>Tcl_ServiceModeHook is called by the
platform-independent portion of the notifier when client
code makes a call to Tcl_SetServiceMode. This hook is
provided to support operating systems that require special
event handling when the application is in a modal loop (the
Windows notifier, for instance, uses this hook to create a
communication win- dow).</p>

<p>On Unix systems, the file event source also needs
support from the notifier. The file event source consists of
the Tcl_CreateFileHandler and Tcl_DeleteFileHandler
procedures, which are described in the Tcl_CreateFileHandler
manual page.</p>

<p>The Tcl_Sleep and Tcl_DoOneEvent interfaces are
described in their respective manual pages.</p>

<p>The easiest way to create a new notifier is to look at
the code for an existing notifier, such as the files
unix/tclUnixNotfy.c or win/tclWin- Notify.c in the Tcl
source distribution.</p>

<p>REPLACING THE NOTIFIER A notifier that has been written
according to the conventions above can also be installed in
a running process in place of the standard noti- fier. This
mechanism is used so that a single executable can be used
(with the standard notifier) as a stand-alone program and
reused (with a replacement notifier in a loadable extension)
as an extension to another program, such as a Web browser
plugin.</p>

<p>To do this, the extension makes a call to
Tcl_SetNotifier passing a pointer to a Tcl_NotifierProcs
data structure. The structure has the following layout:
typedef struct Tcl_NotifierProcs { Tcl_SetTimerProc
*setTimerProc; Tcl_WaitForEventProc *waitForEventProc;
Tcl_CreateFileHandlerProc *createFileHandlerProc;
Tcl_DeleteFileHandlerProc *deleteFileHandlerProc;
Tcl_InitNotifierProc *initNotifierProc;
Tcl_FinalizeNotifierProc *finalizeNotifierProc;
Tcl_AlertNotifierProc *alertNotifierProc;
Tcl_ServiceModeHookProc *serviceModeHookProc; }
Tcl_NotifierProcs; Following the call to Tcl_SetNotifier,
the pointers given in the Tcl_NotifierProcs structure
replace whatever notifier had been installed in the
process.</p>

<p>It is extraordinarily unwise to replace a running
notifier. Normally, Tcl_SetNotifier should be called at
process initialization time before the first call to
Tcl_InitNotifier.</p>

<p>EXTERNAL EVENT LOOPS The notifier interfaces are
designed so that Tcl can be embedded into applications that
have their own private event loops. In this case, the
application does not call Tcl_DoOneEvent except in the case
of recursive event loops such as calls to the Tcl commands
update or vwait. Most of the time is spent in the external
event loop of the application. In this case the notifier
must arrange for the external event loop to call back into
Tcl when something happens on the various Tcl event sources.
These callbacks should arrange for appropriate Tcl events to
be placed on the Tcl event queue.</p>

<p>Because the external event loop is not calling
Tcl_DoOneEvent on a reg- ular basis, it is up to the
notifier to arrange for Tcl_ServiceEvent to be called
whenever events are pending on the Tcl event queue. The eas-
iest way to do this is to invoke Tcl_ServiceAll at the end
of each callback from the external event loop. This will
ensure that all of the event sources are polled, any queued
events are serviced, and any pending idle handlers are
processed before returning control to the application. In
addition, event sources that need to poll for events can
call Tcl_SetMaxBlockTime to force the external event loop to
call Tcl even if no events are available on the system event
queue.</p>

<p>As a side effect of processing events detected in the
main external event loop, Tcl may invoke Tcl_DoOneEvent to
start a recursive event loop in commands like vwait.
Tcl_DoOneEvent will invoke the external event loop, which
will result in callbacks as described in the preced- ing
paragraph, which will result in calls to Tcl_ServiceAll.
However, in these cases it is undesirable to service events
in Tcl_ServiceAll. Servicing events there is unnecessary
because control will immediately return to the external
event loop and hence to Tcl_DoOneEvent, which can service
the events itself. Furthermore, Tcl_DoOneEvent is supposed
to service only a single event, whereas Tcl_ServiceAll
normally ser- vices all pending events. To handle this
situation, Tcl_DoOneEvent sets a flag for Tcl_ServiceAll
that causes it to return without servicing any events. This
flag is called the service mode; Tcl_DoOneEvent restores it
to its previous value before it returns.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, it may be necessary for
Tcl_ServiceAll to ser- vice events even when it has been
invoked from Tcl_DoOneEvent. This happens when there is yet
another recursive event loop invoked via an event handler
called by Tcl_DoOneEvent (such as one that is part of a
native widget). In this case, Tcl_DoOneEvent may not have a
chance to service events so Tcl_ServiceAll must service them
all. Any recursive event loop that calls an external event
loop rather than Tcl_DoOneEvent must reset the service mode
so that all events get processed in Tcl_ServiceAll. This is
done by invoking the Tcl_SetServiceMode proce- dure. If
Tcl_SetServiceMode is passed TCL_SERVICE_NONE, then calls to
Tcl_ServiceAll will return immediately without processing
any events. If Tcl_SetServiceMode is passed TCL_SERVICE_ALL,
then calls to Tcl_Ser- viceAll will behave normally.
Tcl_SetServiceMode returns the previous value of the service
mode, which should be restored when the recursive loop
exits. Tcl_GetServiceMode returns the current value of the
ser- vice mode.</p>
