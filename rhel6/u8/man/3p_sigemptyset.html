<p>SIGEMPTYSET(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SIGEMPTYSET(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sigemptyset - initialize and empty a signal set</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sigemptyset() function initializes the
signal set pointed to by set, such that all signals defined
in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 are excluded.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, sigemptyset()
shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno
to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The implementation of the sigemptyset() (or
sigfillset()) function could quite trivially clear (or set)
all the bits in the signal set. Alternatively, it would be
reasonable to initialize part of the struc- ture, such as a
version field, to permit binary-compatibility between
releases where the size of the set varies. For such reasons,
either sigemptyset() or sigfillset() must be called prior to
any other use of the signal set, even if such use is
read-only (for example, as an argu- ment to sigpending()).
This function is not intended for dynamic allo- cation.</p>

<p>The sigfillset() and sigemptyset() functions require
that the resulting signal set include (or exclude) all the
signals defined in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
Although it is outside the scope of this vol- ume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 to place this requirement on signals that
are implemented as extensions, it is recommended that
implementation- defined signals also be affected by these
functions. However, there may be a good reason for a
particular signal not to be affected. For exam- ple,
blocking or ignoring an implementation-defined signal may
have undesirable side effects, whereas the default action
for that signal is harmless. In such a case, it would be
preferable for such a signal to be excluded from the signal
set returned by sigfillset().</p>

<p>In early proposals there was no distinction between
invalid and unsup- ported signals (the names of optional
signals that were not supported by an implementation were
not defined by that implementation). The [EINVAL] error was
thus specified as a required error for invalid signals. With
that distinction, it is not necessary to require imple-
mentations of these functions to determine whether an
optional signal is actually supported, as that could have a
significant performance impact for little value. The error
could have been required for invalid signals and optional
for unsupported signals, but this seemed unneces- sarily
complex. Thus, the error is optional in both cases.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
