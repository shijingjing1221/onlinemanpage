<p>libcurl(3) libcurl overview libcurl(3)</p>

<p>NAME libcurl - client-side URL transfers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a short overview on how to use
libcurl in your C programs. There are specific man pages for
each function mentioned in here. There are also the
libcurl-easy(3) man page, the libcurl-multi(3) man page, the
libcurl-share(3) man page and the libcurl-tutorial(3) man
page for in-depth understanding on how to program with
libcurl.</p>

<p>There are more than thirty custom bindings available
that bring libcurl access to your favourite language. Look
elsewhere for documentation on those.</p>

<p>libcurl has a global constant environment that you must
set up and maintain while using libcurl. This essentially
means you call curl_global_init(3) at the start of your
program and curl_global_cleanup(3) at the end. See GLOBAL
CONSTANTS below for details.</p>

<p>To transfer files, you always set up an &quot;easy
handle&quot; using curl_easy_init(3), but when you want the
file(s) transferred you have the option of using the
&quot;easy&quot; interface, or the &quot;multi&quot;
interface.</p>

<p>The easy interface is a synchronous interface with which
you call curl_easy_perform(3) and let it perform the
transfer. When it is com- pleted, the function returns and
you can continue. More details are found in the
libcurl-easy(3) man page.</p>

<p>The multi interface on the other hand is an asynchronous
interface, that you call and that performs only a little
piece of the transfer on each invoke. It is perfect if you
want to do things while the transfer is in progress, or
similar. The multi interface allows you to select() on
libcurl action, and even to easily download multiple files
simulta- neously using a single thread. See further details
in the libcurl- multi(3) man page.</p>

<p>You can have multiple easy handles share certain data,
even if they are used in different threads. This magic is
setup using the share inter- face, as described in the
libcurl-share(3) man page.</p>

<p>There is also a series of other helpful functions to
use, including these:</p>

<p>curl_version_info() gets detailed libcurl (and other
used libraries) version info</p>

<p>curl_getdate() converts a date string to time_t</p>

<p>curl_easy_getinfo() get information about a performed
transfer</p>

<p>curl_formadd() helps building an HTTP form POST</p>

<p>curl_formfree() free a list built with
curl_formadd(3)</p>

<p>curl_slist_append() builds a linked list</p>

<p>curl_slist_free_all() frees a whole curl_slist</p>

<p>LINKING WITH LIBCURL On unix-like machines, theres a
tool named curl-config that gets installed with the rest of
the curl stuff when make install is per- formed.</p>

<p>curl-config is added to make it easier for applications
to link with libcurl and developers to learn about libcurl
and how to use it.</p>

<p>Run curl-config --libs to get the (additional) linker
options you need to link with the particular version of
libcurl youve installed. See the curl-config(1) man page for
further details.</p>

<p>Unix-like operating system that ship libcurl as part of
their distribu- tions often dont provide the curl-config
tool, but simply install the library and headers in the
common path for this purpose.</p>

<p>LIBCURL SYMBOL NAMES All public functions in the libcurl
interface are prefixed with curl_ (with a lowercase c). You
can find other functions in the library source code, but
other prefixes indicate that the functions are private and
may change without further notice in the next release.</p>

<p>Only use documented functions and functionality!</p>

<p>PORTABILITY libcurl works exactly the same, on any of
the platforms it compiles and builds on.</p>

<p>THREADS Never ever call curl-functions simultaneously
using the same handle from several threads. libcurl is
thread-safe and can be used in any number of threads, but
you must use separate curl handles if you want to use
libcurl in more than one thread simultaneously.</p>

<p>The global environment functions are not thread-safe.
See GLOBAL CON- STANTS below for details.</p>

<p>PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS Persistent connections means that
libcurl can re-use the same connec- tion for several
transfers, if the conditions are right.</p>

<p>libcurl will always attempt to use persistent
connections. Whenever you use curl_easy_perform(3) or
curl_multi_perform(3), libcurl will attempt to use an
existing connection to do the transfer, and if none exists
it ll open a new one that will be subject for re-use on a
possible fol- lowing call to curl_easy_perform(3) or
curl_multi_perform(3).</p>

<p>To allow libcurl to take full advantage of persistent
connections, you should do as many of your file transfers as
possible using the same curl handle. When you call
curl_easy_cleanup(3), all the possibly open connections held
by libcurl will be closed and forgotten.</p>

<p>Note that the options set with curl_easy_setopt(3) will
be used on every repeated curl_easy_perform(3) call.</p>

<p>GLOBAL CONSTANTS There are a variety of constants that
libcurl uses, mainly through its internal use of other
libraries, which are too complicated for the library loader
to set up. Therefore, a program must call a library function
after the program is loaded and running to finish setting up
the library code. For example, when libcurl is built for SSL
capabil- ity via the GNU TLS library, there is an elaborate
tree inside that library that describes the SSL
protocol.</p>

<p>curl_global_init() is the function that you must call.
This may allo- cate resources (e.g. the memory for the GNU
TLS tree mentioned above), so the companion function
curl_global_cleanup() releases them.</p>

<p>The basic rule for constructing a program that uses
libcurl is this: Call curl_global_init(), with a
CURL_GLOBAL_ALL argument, immediately after the program
starts, while it is still only one thread and before it uses
libcurl at all. Call curl_global_cleanup() immediately
before the program exits, when the program is again only one
thread and after its last use of libcurl.</p>

<p>You can call both of these multiple times, as long as
all calls meet these requirements and the number of calls to
each is the same.</p>

<p>It isnt actually required that the functions be called
at the begin- ning and end of the program -- thats just
usually the easiest way to do it. It is required that the
functions be called when no other thread in the program is
running.</p>

<p>These global constant functions are not thread safe, so
you must not call them when any other thread in the program
is running. It isnt good enough that no other thread is
using libcurl at the time, because these functions
internally call similar functions of other libraries, and
those functions are similarly thread-unsafe. You cant
generally know what these libraries are, or whether other
threads are using them.</p>

<p>The global constant situation merits special
consideration when the code you are writing to use libcurl
is not the main program, but rather a modular piece of a
program, e.g. another library. As a module, your code doesnt
know about other parts of the program -- it doesnt know
whether they use libcurl or not. And its code doesnt
necessarily run at the start and end of the whole
program.</p>

<p>A module like this must have global constant functions
of its own, just like curl_global_init() and
curl_global_cleanup(). The module thus has control at the
beginning and end of the program and has a place to call the
libcurl functions. Note that if multiple modules in the
program use libcurl, they all will separately call the
libcurl functions, and that s OK because only the first
curl_global_init() and the last curl_global_cleanup() in a
program change anything. (libcurl uses a reference count in
static memory).</p>

<p>In a C++ module, it is common to deal with the global
constant situa- tion by defining a special class that
represents the global constant environment of the module. A
program always has exactly one object of the class, in
static storage. That way, the program automatically calls
the constructor of the object as the program starts up and
the destructor as it terminates. As the author of this
libcurl-using mod- ule, you can make the constructor call
curl_global_init() and the destructor call
curl_global_cleanup() and satisfy libcurls require- ments
without your user having to think about it.</p>

<p>curl_global_init() has an argument that tells what
particular parts of the global constant environment to set
up. In order to successfully use any value except
CURL_GLOBAL_ALL (which says to set up the whole thing), you
must have specific knowledge of internal workings of libcurl
and all other parts of the program of which it is part.</p>

<p>A special part of the global constant environment is the
identity of the memory allocator. curl_global_init() selects
the system default memory allocator, but you can use
curl_global_init_mem() to supply one of your own. However,
there is no way to use curl_global_init_mem() in a modular
program -- all modules in the program that might use libcurl
would have to agree on one allocator.</p>

<p>There is a failsafe in libcurl that makes it usable in
simple situa- tions without you having to worry about the
global constant environment at all: curl_easy_init() sets up
the environment itself if it hasnt been done yet. The
resources it acquires to do so get released by the operating
system automatically when the program exits.</p>

<p>This failsafe feature exists mainly for backward
compatibility because there was a time when the global
functions didn t exist. Because it is sufficient only in the
simplest of programs, it is not recommended for any program
to rely on it.</p>
