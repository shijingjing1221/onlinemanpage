<p>NAME mount.gfs2 - GFS2 mount options</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mount -a [-fnrsvw] -t gfs2 [-O options] mount
[-fnrsvw] -t gfs2 [-o options ] device dir</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For details on the common mount options,
please see the mount(8) com- mand man page. The device may
be any block device on which you have created a GFS2
filesystem. Examples include a single disk partition (e.g.
/dev/sdb3), a loopback device, a device exported from
another node (e.g. an iSCSI device), or a logical volume
(typically comprised of a number of individual disks).</p>

<p>device does not necessarily need to match the device
name as seen on another node in the cluster, nor does it
need to be a logical volume. However, the use of a
cluster-aware volume manager such as CLVM2 (see lvm(8)) will
guarantee that the managed devices are named identically on
each node in a cluster (for much easier management), and
will allow you to configure a very large volume from
multiple storage units (e.g. disk drives).</p>

<p>device must make the entire filesystem storage area
visible to the com- puter. That is, you cannot mount
different parts of a single filesys- tem on different
computers. Each computer must see an entire filesys- tem.
You may, however, mount several GFS2 filesystems if you want
to distribute your data storage in a controllable way.</p>

<p>This man page describes GFS2-specific options that can
be passed to the GFS2 file system at mount time, using the
-o flag. There are many other -o options handled by the
generic mount command mount(8). How- ever, the options
described below are specifically for GFS2, and are not
interpreted by the mount command nor by the kernels Virtual
File System. GFS2 and non-GFS2 options may be intermingled
after the -o, separated by commas (but no spaces).</p>

<p>The options commit, discard, errors, quota_quantum,
statfs_quantum, statfs_percent, barrier, acl, quota,
suiddir, and data can be changed after mount using the
&quot;mount -o remount,option /mountpoint&quot; command. The
options quota, discard, barrier, acl, and suiddir support
the &quot;no&quot; prefix. For example, &quot;noacl&quot;
turns off what &quot;acl&quot; turns on.</p>

<p>If you have trouble mounting GFS2, check the syslog
(e.g. /var/log/mes- sages) for specific error messages.</p>

<p>OPTIONS lockproto=LockProtoName This specifies which
inter-node lock protocol is used by the GFS2 filesystem for
this mount, overriding the default lock pro- tocol name
stored in the filesystem s on-disk superblock.</p>

<p>The LockProtoName must be one of the supported locking
proto- cols, currently these are lock_nolock and
lock_dlm.</p>

<p>The default lock protocol name is written to disk
initially when creating the filesystem with mkfs.gfs2(8), -p
option. It can be changed on-disk by using the gfs2_tool(8)
utility s sb proto command.</p>

<p>The lockproto mount option should be used only under
special circumstances in which you want to temporarily use a
different lock protocol without changing the on-disk
default. Using the incorrect lock protocol on a cluster
filesystem mounted from more than one node will almost
certainly result in filesystem corruption.</p>

<p>locktable=LockTableName This specifies the identity of
the cluster and of the filesystem for this mount, overriding
the default cluster/filesystem iden- tify stored in the
filesystems on-disk superblock. The clus- ter/filesystem
name is recognized globally throughout the clus- ter, and
establishes a unique namespace for the inter-node lock- ing
system, enabling the mounting of multiple GFS2
filesystems.</p>

<p>The format of LockTableName is lock-module-specific. For
lock_dlm, the format is clustername:fsname. For lock_nolock,
the field is ignored.</p>

<p>The default cluster/filesystem name is written to disk
initially when creating the filesystem with mkfs.gfs2(8), -t
option. It can be changed on-disk by using the gfs2_tool(8)
utilitys sb table command.</p>

<p>The locktable mount option should be used only under
special circumstances in which you want to mount the
filesystem in a different cluster, or mount it as a
different filesystem name, without changing the on-disk
default.</p>

<p>localcaching This flag tells GFS2 that it is running as
a local (not clus- tered) filesystem, so it can turn on some
block caching opti- mizations that cant be used when running
in cluster mode.</p>

<p>This is turned on automatically by the lock_nolock
module, but can be overridden by using the ignore_local_fs
option.</p>

<p>localflocks This flag tells GFS2 that it is running as a
local (not clus- tered) filesystem, so it can allow the
kernel VFS layer to do all flock and fcntl file locking.
When running in cluster mode, these file locks require
inter-node locks, and require the sup- port of GFS2. When
running locally, better performance is achieved by letting
VFS handle the whole job.</p>

<p>This is turned on automatically by the lock_nolock
module, but can be overridden by using the ignore_local_fs
option.</p>

<p>errors=[panic|withdraw] Setting errors=panic causes GFS2
to oops when encountering an error that would otherwise
cause the mount to withdraw or print an assertion warning.
The default setting is errors=withdraw. This option should
not be used in a production system. It replaces the earlier
debug option on kernel versions 2.6.31 and above.</p>

<p>ignore_local_fs By default, using the nolock lock module
automatically turns on the localcaching and localflocks
optimizations. ignore_local_fs forces GFS2 to treat the
filesystem as if it were a multihost (clustered) filesystem,
with localcaching and localflocks opti- mizations turned
off.</p>

<p>upgrade This flag tells GFS2 to upgrade the filesystems
on-disk format to the version supported by the current GFS2
software installation on this computer. If you try to mount
an old-ver- sion disk image, GFS2 will notify you via a
syslog message that you need to upgrade. Try mounting again,
using the -o upgrade option. When upgrading, only one node
may mount the GFS2 filesystem.</p>

<p>acl Enables POSIX Access Control List acl(5) support
within GFS2.</p>

<p>spectator Mount this filesystem using a special form of
read-only mount. The mount does not use one of the
filesystems journals. The node is unable to recover journals
for other nodes.</p>

<p>suiddir Sets owner of any newly created file or
directory to be that of parent directory, if parent
directory has S_ISUID permission attribute bit set. Sets
S_ISUID in any new directory, if its parent directory s
S_ISUID is set. Strips all execution bits on a new file, if
parent directory owner is different from owner of process
creating the file. Set this option only if you know why you
are setting it.</p>

<p>quota=[off/account/on] Turns quotas on or off for a
filesystem. Setting the quotas to be in the
&quot;account&quot; state causes the per UID/GID usage
statis- tics to be correctly maintained by the filesystem,
limit and warn values are ignored. The default value is
&quot;off&quot;.</p>

<p>discard Causes GFS2 to generate &quot;discard&quot; I/O
requests for blocks which have been freed. These can be used
by suitable hardware to implement thin-provisioning and
similar schemes. This feature is supported in kernel version
2.6.30 and above.</p>

<p>barrier This option, which defaults to on, causes GFS2
to send I/O bar- riers when flushing the journal. The option
is automatically turned off if the underlying device does
not support I/O barri- ers. We highly recommend the use of
I/O barriers with GFS2 at all times unless the block device
is designed so that it cannot lose its write cache content
(e.g. its on a UPS, or it doesnt have a write cache)</p>

<p>commit=secs This is similar to the ext3 commit= option
in that it sets the maximum number of seconds between
journal commits if there is dirty data in the journal. The
default is 60 seconds. This option is only provided in
kernel versions 2.6.31 and above.</p>

<p>data=[ordered|writeback] When data=ordered is set, the
user data modified by a transac- tion is flushed to the disk
before the transaction is committed to disk. This should
prevent the user from seeing uninitialized blocks in a file
after a crash. Data=writeback mode writes the user data to
the disk at any time after it s dirtied. This doesn t
provide the same consistency guarantee as ordered mode, but
it should be slightly faster for some workloads. The default
is ordered mode.</p>

<p>meta This option results in selecting the meta
filesystem root rather than the normal filesystem root. This
option is normally only used by the GFS2 utility functions.
Altering any file on the GFS2 meta filesystem may render the
filesystem unusable, so only experts in the GFS2 on-disk
layout should use this option.</p>

<p>quota_quantum=secs This sets the number of seconds for
which a change in the quota information may sit on one node
before being written to the quota file. This is the
preferred way to set this parameter. The value is an integer
number of seconds greater than zero. The default is 60
seconds. Shorter settings result in faster updates of the
lazy quota information and less likelihood of someone
exceeding their quota. Longer settings make filesystem
opera- tions involving quotas faster and more efficient.</p>

<p>statfs_quantum=secs Setting statfs_quantum to 0 is the
preferred way to set the slow version of statfs. The default
value is 30 secs which sets the maximum time period before
statfs changes will be syned to the master statfs file. This
can be adjusted to allow for faster, less accurate statfs
values or slower more accurate values. When set to 0, statfs
will always report the true values.</p>

<p>statfs_percent=value This setting provides a bound on
the maximum percentage change in the statfs information on a
local basis before it is synced back to the master statfs
file, even if the time period has not expired. If the
setting of statfs_quantum is 0, then this set- ting is
ignored.</p>

<p>BUGS GFS2 doesnt support errors=remount-ro or
data=journal. It is not pos- sible to switch support for
user and group quotas on and off indepen- dently of each
other. Some of the error messages are rather cryptic, if you
encounter one of these messages check firstly that
gfs_controld is running and secondly that you have enough
journals on the filesystem for the number of nodes in
use.</p>
