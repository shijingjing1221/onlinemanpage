<p>DESCRIPTION The restore command performs the inverse
function of dump(8). A full backup of a file system may be
restored and subsequent incremental backups layered on top
of it. Single files and directory subtrees may be restored
from full or partial backups. Restore works across a net-
work; to do this see the -f flag described below. Other
arguments to the command are file or directory names
specifying the files that are to be restored. Unless the -h
flag is specified (see below), the appearance of a directory
name refers to the files and (recursively) subdirectories of
that directory.</p>

<p>Exactly one of the following flags is required:</p>

<p>-C This mode allows comparison of files from a dump.
Restore reads the backup and compares its contents with
files present on the disk. It first changes its working
directory to the root of the filesystem that was dumped and
compares the tape with the files in its new current
directory. See also the -L flag described below.</p>

<p>-i This mode allows interactive restoration of files
from a dump. After reading in the directory information from
the dump, restore provides a shell like interface that
allows the user to move around the directory tree selecting
files to be extracted. The available commands are given
below; for those commands that require an argument, the
default is the current directory.</p>

<p>add [arg] The current directory or specified argument is
added to the list of files to be extracted. If a directory
is specified, then it and all its descendents are added to
the extraction list (unless the -h flag is specified on the
command line). Files that are on the extraction list are
prepended with a * when they are listed by ls.</p>

<p>cd arg Change the current working directory to the
specified argument.</p>

<p>delete [arg] The current directory or specified argument
is deleted from the list of files to be extracted. If a
directory is specified, then it and all its descendents are
deleted from the extraction list (unless the -h flag is
specified on the command line). The most expedient way to
extract most of the files from a directory is to add the
direc- tory to the extraction list and then delete those
files that are not needed.</p>

<p>extract All files on the extraction list are extracted
from the dump. Restore will ask which volume the user wishes
to mount. The fastest way to extract a f ew files is to
start with the last volume and work towards the first
volume.</p>

<p>help List a summary of the available commands.</p>

<p>ls [arg] List the current or specified directory.
Entries that are directories are appended with a /. Entries
that have been marked for extraction are prepended with a *.
If the verbose flag is set, the inode number of each entry
is also listed.</p>

<p>pwd Print the full pathname of the current working
directory.</p>

<p>quit Restore immediately exits, even if the extraction
list is not empty.</p>

<p>setmodes All directories that have been added to the
extraction list have their owner, modes, and times set;
nothing is extracted from the dump. This is useful for
cleaning up after a restore has been prematurely
aborted.</p>

<p>verbose The sense of the -v flag is toggled. When set,
the ver- bose flag causes the ls command to list the inode
numbers of all entries. It also causes restore to print out
information about each file as it is extracted.</p>

<p>-P file Restore creates a new Quick File Access file
file from an exist- ing dump file without restoring its
contents.</p>

<p>-R Restore requests a particular tape of a multi-volume
set on which to restart a full restore (see the -r flag
below). This is useful if the restore has been
interrupted.</p>

<p>-r Restore (rebuild) a file system. The target file
system should be made pristine with mke2fs(8), mounted, and
the user cdd into the pristine file system before starting
the restoration of the initial level 0 backup. If the level
0 restores successfully, the -r flag may be used to restore
any necessary incremental backups on top of the level 0. The
-r flag precludes an interac- tive file extraction and can
be detrimental to ones health (not to mention the disk) if
not used carefully. An example:</p>

<p>mke2fs /dev/sda1</p>

<p>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt</p>

<p>cd /mnt</p>

<p>restore rf /dev/st0</p>

<p>Note that restore leaves a file restoresymtable in the
root directory to pass information between incremental
restore passes. This file should be removed when the last
incremental has been restored.</p>

<p>Restore, in conjunction with mke2fs(8) and dump(8), may
be used to modify file system parameters such as size or
block size.</p>

<p>-t The names of the specified files are listed if they
occur on the backup. If no file argument is given, the root
directory is listed, which results in the entire content of
the backup being listed, unless the -h flag has been
specified. Note that the -t flag replaces the function of
the old dumpdir(8) program. See also the -X option
below.</p>

<p>-x The named files are read from the given media. If a
named file matches a directory whose contents are on the
backup and the -h flag is not specified, the directory is
recursively extracted. The owner, modification time, and
mode are restored (if possi- ble). If no file argument is
given, the root directory is extracted, which results in the
entire content of the backup being extracted, unless the -h
flag has been specified. See also the -X option below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following additional options may be
specified:</p>

<p>-a In -i or -x mode, restore does ask the user for the
volume num- ber on which the files to be extracted are
supposed to be (in order to minimise the time by reading
only the interesting vol- umes). The -a option disables this
behaviour and reads all the volumes starting with 1. This
option is useful when the operator does not know on which
volume the files to be extracted are and/or when he prefers
the longer unattended mode rather than the shorter
interactive mode.</p>

<p>-A archive_file Read the table of contents from
archive_file instead of the media. This option can be used
in combination with the -t, -i, or -x options, making it
possible to check whether files are on the media without
having to mount the media.</p>

<p>-b blocksize The number of kilobytes per dump record. If
the -b option is not specified, restore tries to determine
the media block size dynamically.</p>

<p>-c Normally, restore will try to determine dynamically
whether the dump was made from an old (pre-4.4) or new
format file system. The -c flag disables this check, and
only allows reading a dump in the old format.</p>

<p>-d The -d (debug) flag causes restore to print debug
information.</p>

<p>-D filesystem The -D flag allows the user to specify the
filesystem name when using restore with the -C option to
check the backup.</p>

<p>-f file Read the backup from file; file may be a special
device file like /dev/st0 (a tape drive), /dev/sda1 (a disk
drive), an ordi- nary file, or - (the standard input). If
the name of the file is of the form host:file or
user@host:file, restore reads from the named file on the
remote host using rmt(8).</p>

<p>-F script Run script at the beginning of each tape. The
device name and the current volume number are passed on the
command line. The script must return 0 if restore should
continue without asking the user to change the tape, 1 if
restore should continue but ask the user to change the tape.
Any other exit code will cause restore to abort. For
security reasons, restore reverts back to the real user ID
and the real group ID before running the script.</p>

<p>-h Extract the actual directory, rather than the files
that it ref- erences. This prevents hierarchical restoration
of complete sub- trees from the dump.</p>

<p>-H hash_size Use a hashtable having the specified number
of entries for stor- ing the directories entries instead of
a linked list. This hashtable will considerably speed up
inode lookups (visible especially in interactive mode when
adding/removing files from the restore list), but at the
price of much more memory usage. The default value is 1,
meaning no hashtable is used.</p>

<p>-k Use Kerberos authentication when contacting the
remote tape server. (Only available if this options was
enabled when restore was compiled.)</p>

<p>-l When doing remote restores, assume the remote file is
a regular file (instead of a tape device). If you re
restoring a remote compressed file, you will need to specify
this option or restore will fail to access it correctly.</p>

<p>-L limit The -L flag allows the user to specify a
maximal number of mis- compares when using restore with the
-C option to check the backup. If this limit is reached,
restore will abort with an error message. A value of 0 (the
default value) disables the check.</p>

<p>-m Extract by inode numbers rather than by file name.
This is use- ful if only a few files are being extracted,
and one wants to avoid regenerating the complete pathname to
the file.</p>

<p>-M Enables the multi-volume feature (for reading dumps
made using the -M option of dump). The name specified with
-f is treated as a prefix and restore tries to read in
sequence from &lt;prefix&gt;001, &lt;prefix&gt;002 etc.</p>

<p>-N The -N flag causes restore to perform a full
execution as requested by one of -i, -R, -r, t or x command
without actually writing any file on disk.</p>

<p>-o The -o flag causes restore to automatically restore
the current directory permissions without asking the
operator whether to do so in one of -i or -x modes.</p>

<p>-Q file Use the file file in order to read tape position
as stored using the dump Quick File Access mode, in one of
-i, -x or -t mode.</p>

<p>It is recommended to set up the st driver to return
logical tape positions rather than physical before calling
dump/restore with parameter -Q. Since not all tape devices
support physical tape positions those tape devices return an
error during dump/restore when the st driver is set to the
default physical setting. Please see the st(4) man page,
option MTSETDRVBUFFER , or the mt(1) man page, on how to set
the driver to return logical tape positions.</p>

<p>Before calling restore with parameter -Q, always make
sure the st driver is set to return the same type of tape
position used during the call to dump. Otherwise restore may
be confused.</p>

<p>This option can be used when restoring from local or
remote tapes (see above) or from local or remote files.</p>

<p>-s fileno Read from the specified fileno on a multi-file
tape. File num- bering starts at 1.</p>

<p>-T directory The -T flag allows the user to specify a
directory to use for the storage of temporary files. The
default value is /tmp. This flag is most useful when
restoring files after having booted from a floppy. There
might be little or no space on the floppy filesystem, but
another source of space might exist.</p>

<p>-u When creating certain types of files, restore may
generate a warning diagnostic if they already exist in the
target direc- tory. To prevent this, the -u (unlink) flag
causes restore to remove old entries before attempting to
create new ones.</p>

<p>-v Normally restore does its work silently. The -v
(verbose) flag causes it to type the name of each file it
treats preceded by its file type.</p>

<p>-V Enables reading multi-volume non-tape mediums like
CDROMs.</p>

<p>-X filelist Read list of files to be listed or extracted
from the text file filelist in addition to those specified
on the command line. This can be used in conjunction with
the -t or -x commands. The file filelist should contain file
names separated by newlines. filelist may be an ordinary
file or - (the standard input).</p>

<p>-y Do not ask the user whether to abort the restore in
the event of an error. Always try to skip over the bad
block(s) and con- tinue.</p>

<p>(The 4.3BSD option syntax is implemented for backward
compatibility but is not documented here.)</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Complains if it gets a read error. If y has
been specified, or the user responds y, restore will attempt
to continue the restore.</p>

<p>If a backup was made using more than one tape volume,
restore will notify the user when it is time to mount the
next volume. If the -x or -i flag has been specified,
restore will also ask which volume the user wishes to mount.
The fastest way to extract a few files is to start with the
last volume, and work towards the first volume.</p>

<p>There are numerous consistency checks that can be listed
by restore. Most checks are self-explanatory or can never
happen . Common errors are given below:</p>

<p>Converting to new file system format A dump tape created
from the old file system has been loaded. It is
automatically converted to the new file system format.</p>

<p>&lt;filename&gt;: not found on tape The specified file
name was listed in the tape directory, but was not found on
the tape. This is caused by tape read errors while looking
for the file, and from using a dump tape created on an
active file system.</p>

<p>expected next file &lt;inumber&gt;, got &lt;inumber&gt;
A file that was not listed in the directory showed up. This
can occur when using a dump created on an active file
system.</p>

<p>Incremental dump too low When doing an incremental
restore, a dump that was written before the previous
incremental dump, or that has too low an incremental level
has been loaded.</p>

<p>Incremental dump too high When doing an incremental
restore, a dump that does not begin its coverage where the
previous incremental dump left off, or that has too high an
incremental level has been loaded.</p>

<p>Tape read error while restoring &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p>Tape read error while skipping over inode
&lt;inumber&gt;</p>

<p>Tape read error while trying to resynchronize A tape (or
other media) read error has occurred. If a file name is
specified, its contents are probably partially wrong. If an
inode is being skipped or the tape is trying to
resynchronize, no extracted files have been corrupted,
though files may not be found on the tape.</p>

<p>resync restore, skipped &lt;num&gt; blocks After a dump
read error, restore may have to resynchronize itself. This
message lists the number of blocks that were skipped
over.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Restore exits with zero status on success.
Tape errors are indicated with an exit code of 1.</p>

<p>When doing a comparison of files from a dump, an exit
code of 2 indi- cates that some files were modified or
deleted since the dump was made.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT If the following environment variable exists
it will be utilized by restore:</p>

<p>TAPE If no -f option was specified, restore will use the
device spec- ified via TAPE as the dump device. TAPE may be
of the form tapename, host:tapename or
user@host:tapename.</p>

<p>TMPDIR The directory given in TMPDIR will be used
instead of /tmp to store temporary files.</p>

<p>RMT The environment variable RMT will be used to
determine the path- name of the remote rmt(8) program.</p>

<p>RSH Restore uses the contents of this variable to
determine the name of the remote shell command to use when
doing a network restore (rsh, ssh etc.). If this variable is
not set, rcmd(3) will be used, but only root will be able to
do a network restore.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/st0 the default tape drive</p>

<p>/tmp/rstdir* file containing directories on the tape</p>

<p>/tmp/rstmode* owner, mode, and time stamps for
directories</p>

<p>./restoresymtable information passed between incremental
restores</p>

<p>SEE ALSO dump(8), mount(8), mke2fs(8), rmt(8)</p>

<p>BUGS Restore can get confused when doing incremental
restores from dumps that were made on active file
systems.</p>

<p>A level 0 dump must be done after a full restore.
Because restore runs in user code, it has no control over
inode allocation; thus a full dump must be done to get a new
set of directories reflecting the new inode numbering, even
though the content of the files is unchanged.</p>

<p>The temporary files /tmp/rstdir* and /tmp/rstmode* are
generated with a unique name based on the date of the dump
and the process ID (see mktemp(3)), except when -r or -R is
used. Because -R allows you to restart a -r operation that
may have been interrupted, the temporary files should be the
same across different processes. In all other cases, the
files are unique because it is possible to have two differ-
ent dumps started at the same time, and separate operations
shouldnt conflict with each other.</p>

<p>To do a network restore, you have to run restore as root
or use a remote shell replacement (see RSH variable). This
is due to the previ- ous security history of dump and
restore. ( restore is written to be setuid root, but we are
not certain all bugs are gone from the code - run setuid at
your own risk.)</p>

<p>At the end of restores in -i or -x modes (unless -o
option is in use), restore will ask the operator whether to
set the permissions on the current directory. If the
operator confirms this action, the permis- sions on the
directory from where restore was launched will be replaced
by the permissions on the dumped root inode. Although this
behaviour is not really a bug, it has proven itself to be
confusing for many users, so it is recommended to answer no
, unless youre performing a full restore and you do want to
restore the permissions on /.</p>

<p>It should be underlined that because it runs in user
code, restore , when run with the -C option, sees the files
as the kernel presents them, whereas dump sees all the files
on a given filesystem. In partic- ular, this can cause some
confusion when comparing a dumped filesystem a part of which
is hidden by a filesystem mounted on top of it.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The dump/restore backup suite was ported to
Linuxs Second Extended File System by Remy Card
&lt;card@Linux.EU.Org&gt;. He maintained the initial
versions of dump (up and including 0.4b4, released in
January 1997).</p>

<p>Starting with 0.4b5, the new maintainer is Stelian Pop
&lt;stelian@popies.net&gt;.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The dump/restore backup suite is available
from &lt;http://dump.source- forge.net&gt;</p>

<p>HISTORY The restore command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
