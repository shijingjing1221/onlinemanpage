<p>NAME i2c_register_board_info - statically declare I2C
devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int i2c_register_board_info(int busnum, struct
i2c_board_info const * info, unsigned len);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS busnum identifies the bus to which these
devices belong</p>

<p>info vector of i2c device descriptors</p>

<p>len how many descriptors in the vector; may be zero to
reserve the specified bus number.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Systems using the Linux I2C driver stack can
declare tables of board info while they initialize. This
should be done in board-specific init code near
arch_initcall time, or equivalent, before any I2C adapter
driver is registered. For example, mainboard init code could
define several devices, as could the init code for each
daughtercard in a board stack.</p>

<p>The I2C devices will be created later, after the adapter
for the relevant bus has been registered. After that moment,
standard driver model tools are used to bind new style I2C
drivers to the devices. The bus number for any device
declared using this routine is not available for dynamic
allocation.</p>

<p>The board info passed can safely be __initdata, but be
careful of embedded pointers (for platform_data, functions,
etc) since that won&acute;t be copied.</p>
