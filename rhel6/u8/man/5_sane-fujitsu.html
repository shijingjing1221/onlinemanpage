<p>sane-fujitsu(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-fujitsu(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-fujitsu - SANE backend for Fujitsu flatbed and
ADF scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-fujitsu library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to
most Fujitsu flatbed and ADF scanners.</p>

<p>This document describes backend version 98, which
shipped with SANE 1.0.21.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE This version supports every known
model which speaks the Fujitsu SCSI and SCSI-over-USB
protocols. Specifically, the SCSI M309x and M409x series,
the SCSI fi-series, most of the USB fi-series, and the USB
ScanSnap S5xx/S15xx scanners are supported. Please see the
list at
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html for
details.</p>

<p>This backend may support other Fujitsu scanners. The
best way to deter- mine level of support is to test the
scanner directly, or to collect a trace of the windows
driver in action. Please contact the author for help or with
test results.</p>

<p>UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE The following scanners are known
NOT to work with this backend, either because they have a
non-fujitsu chipset, or an unsupported interface type. Some
of these scanners may be supported by another backend.</p>

<p>-------------------------------------- SCSI: SERIAL:
USB: ------------ ------------ ------------ ScanStation
M3093E/DE/EX fi-4110EOX/2 ScanPartner M3096EX fi-4010CU
SP-Jr M3097E+/DE S300/S300M SP-10/10C M3099A/EH/EX fi-60F
SP-15C/300C fi-5015C SP-600C/620C</p>

<p>OPTIONS Effort has been made to expose all hardware
options, including:</p>

<p>source s Selects the source for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Flatbed&quot;, &quot;ADF Front&quot;,
&quot;ADF Back&quot;, &quot;ADF Duplex&quot;.</p>

<p>mode m Selects the mode for the scan. Options may
include &quot;Lineart&quot;, &quot;Halftone&quot;,
&quot;Gray&quot;, and &quot;Color&quot;.</p>

<p>resolution, y-resolution Controls scan resolution.
Setting --resolution also sets --y-resolution, though this
behavior is overridden by some fron- tends.</p>

<p>tl-x, tl-y, br-x, br-y Sets scan area upper left and
lower right coordinates. These are renamed t, l, x, y by
some frontends.</p>

<p>page-width, page-height Sets paper size. Used by scanner
to determine centering of scan coordinates when using ADF
and to detect double feed errors.</p>

<p>Other options will be available based on the
capabilities of the scan- ner: machines with IPC or DTC will
have additional enhancement options, those with CMP will
have compression options, those with a printer will have a
group of endorser options.</p>

<p>Additionally, several software options are exposed by
the backend. These are reimplementations of features
provided natively by larger scanners, but running on the
host computer. This enables smaller machines to have similar
capabilites. Please note that these features are somewhat
simplistic, and may not perform as well as the native
implementations. Note also that these features all require
that the driver cache the entire image in memory. This will
almost certainly result in a reduction of scanning
speed.</p>

<p>Use scanimage --help to get a list, but be aware that
some options may be settable only when another option has
been set, and that advanced options may be hidden by some
frontend programs.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
&quot;fujitsu.conf&quot; is used to tell the backend how to
look for scanners, and provide options controlling the
operation of the backend. This file is read each time the
frontend asks the backend for a list of scanners, generally
only when the frontend starts. If the configuration file is
missing, the backend will use a set of compiled defaults,
which are identical to the default configuration file
shipped with SANE.</p>

<p>Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4
ways:</p>

<p>&quot;scsi FUJITSU&quot; Requests backend to search all
scsi busses in the system for a device which reports itself
to be a scanner made by FUJITSU.</p>

<p>&quot;scsi /dev/sg0&quot; (or other scsi device file)
Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful
if you have multiple compatible scanners connected to your
system, and need to specify one. Probably should not be used
with the other &quot;scsi&quot; line above.</p>

<p>&quot;usb 0x04c5 0x1042&quot; (or other vendor/product
ids) Requests backend to search all usb busses in the system
for a device which uses that vendor and product id. The
device will then be queried to determine if it is a Fujitsu
scanner.</p>

<p>&quot;usb /dev/usb/scanner0&quot; (or other device file)
Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners.
This method is untested.</p>

<p>The only configuration option supported is
&quot;buffer-size=xxx&quot;, allowing you to set the number
of bytes in the data buffer to something other than the
compiled-in default, 65536 (64K). Some users report that
their scanner will &quot;hang&quot; mid-page, or fail to
transmit the image if the buffer is not large enough.</p>

<p>Note: This option may appear multiple times in the
configuration file. It only applies to scanners discovered
by scsi/usb lines that follow this option.</p>

<p>Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this
value, as some users required it to be quite large. Values
above the default are not recommended, and may crash your OS
or lockup your scsi card driver. You have been warned.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The backend uses a single environment
variable, SANE_DEBUG_FUJITSU, which enables debugging output
to stderr. Valid values are:</p>

<p>5 Errors 10 Function trace 15 Function detail 20 Option
commands 25 SCSI/USB trace 30 SCSI/USB detail 35 Useless
noise</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES Flatbed units may fail to scan at maximum
area, particularly at high resolution.</p>

<p>Any model that does not support VPD during inquiry will
not function until an override is added to the backend.</p>

<p>CCITT Fax compression used by older scanners is not
supported.</p>

<p>Hardware automatic paper width detection (aka
auto-cropping) is not supported.</p>

<p>JPEG output is supported by the backend, but not by the
SANE protocol, so is disabled in this release. It can be
enabled if you rebuild from source.</p>
