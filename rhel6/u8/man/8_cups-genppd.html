<p>NAME cups-genppd - generate Gutenprint PPD files for use
with CUPS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cups-genppd [-c localedir] [-l locale] [-p
prefix] [-q] [-v] model1 [model2, ...modeln] cups-genppd -L
[-c localedir] cups-genppd -M [-v] cups-genppd -h
cups-genppd -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cups-genppd generates Gutenprint PPD files
for use with CUPS. The default behavior is to output PPD
files for all models of printer that the Gutenprint printer
driver library supports. You may restrict the models by
listing either the driver names or the full names of the
printers you wish to generate PPD files for after any
options. Addi- tionally, the PPD files may be localised,
that is, translated, to use your native language rather than
US English. There are commands to find out what printer
models and languages are supported.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES cups-genppd -v bjc-6200Epson Stylus Photo 1280
HP DeskJet 850C verbosely generate three PPD files, listing
the driver name in the first case, and the full name in the
second.</p>

<p>LANG=de_DE genppd -p ppd -c /usr/share/locale generate
PPDs for all available models, in directory ppd using the
locale data found under /usr/share/locale. The language to
use is taken from the environment (de_DE).</p>

<p>cups-genppd -L -c /usr/local/share/locale list available
languages using the locale data found under
/usr/local/share/locale.</p>

<p>cups-genppd -M -v list available drivers, with long
model descriptions</p>

<p>COMMANDS -h show a help message</p>

<p>-L list available translations (message catalogs). If a
locale is used for which there is not a corresponding
translation, then then US English will be used.</p>

<p>-M list available printer models. By default, only
driver names are listed; if verbose mode is used, the full
model name will also be printed</p>

<p>-V show version information and defaults</p>

<p>The default behavior is to output PPDs if no command is
given.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c localedir use localedir as the base directory
for locale data</p>

<p>-l locale output PPDs translated with messages for
locale. Note that locale must be a locale as shown by locale
-a. For example, the de translation is used by the de_DE
locale; de alone will not work.</p>

<p>-p prefix output PPDs in directory prefix. Directories
are not recur- sively created.</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p>models a list of printer models, either the driver or
quoted full name.</p>
