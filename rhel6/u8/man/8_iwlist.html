<p>DESCRIPTION Iwlist is used to display some additional
information from a wireless network interface that is not
displayed by iwconfig(8). The main argu- ment is used to
select a category of information, iwlist displays in
detailed form all information related to this category,
including information already shown by iwconfig(8).</p>

<p>PARAMETERS scan[ning] Give the list of Access Points and
Ad-Hoc cells in range, and optionally a whole bunch of
information about them (ESSID, Qual- ity, Frequency,
Mode...). The type of information returned depends on what
the card supports. Triggering scanning is a privileged
operation (root only) and normal users can only read
left-over scan results. By default, the way scanning is done
(the scope of the scan) is dependant on the card and card
settings. This command take optional arguments, however most
drivers will ignore those. The option essid is used to
specify a scan on a specific ESSID. The option last do not
trigger a scan and read left-over scan results.</p>

<p>freq[uency]/channel Give the list of available
frequencies in the device and the number of defined
channels. Please note that usually the driver returns the
total number of channels and only the frequencies available
in the present locale, so there is no one-to-one map- ping
between frequencies displayed and channel numbers.</p>

<p>rate/bit[rate] List the bit-rates supported by the
device.</p>

<p>keys/enc[ryption] List the encryption key sizes
supported and list all the encryp- tion keys set in the
device.</p>

<p>power List the various Power Management attributes and
modes of the device.</p>

<p>txpower List the various Transmit Powers available on
the device.</p>

<p>retry List the transmit retry limits and retry lifetime
on the device.</p>

<p>ap/accesspoint/peers Give the list of Access Points in
range, and optionally the quality of link to them. This
feature is obsolete and now depre- cated in favor of
scanning support (above), and most drivers dont support it.
Some drivers may use this command to return a specific list
of Peers or Access Points, such as the list of Peers associ-
ated/registered with the card. See your driver documentation
for details.</p>

<p>event List the wireless events supported by the
device.</p>

<p>auth List the WPA authentication parametes curently
set.</p>

<p>wpa[keys] List all the WPA encryption keys set in the
device.</p>

<p>genie List the Generic Information Elements set in the
device (used for WPA support).</p>

<p>modu[lation] List the modulations supported by the
device and the modulations currently enabled.</p>

<p>--version Display the version of the tools, as well as
the recommended and current Wireless Extensions version for
the tool and the various wireless interfaces.</p>

<p>--help Display short help message.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/wireless</p>
