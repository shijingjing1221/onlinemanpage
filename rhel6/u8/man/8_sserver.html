<p>SSERVER(8) SSERVER(8)</p>

<p>NAME sserver - sample Kerberos version 5 server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sserver [ -p port ] [ -S keytab ] [ server_port
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sserver and sclient are a simple
demonstration client/server applica- tion. When sclient
connects to sserver, it performs a Kerberos authen-
tication, and then sserver returns to sclient the Kerberos
principal which was used for the Kerberos authentication. It
makes a good test that Kerberos has been successfully
installed on a machine.</p>

<p>The service name used by sserver and sclient is sample.
Hence, sserver will require that there be a keytab entry for
the service &quot;sample/host-
name.domain.name@REALM.NAME&quot;. This keytab is generated
using the kad- min(8) program. The keytab file is usually
installed as &quot;/etc/krb5.keytab&quot;.</p>

<p>The -S option allows for a different keytab than the
default.</p>

<p>sserver is normally invoked out of inetd(8), using a
line in /etc/inetd.conf that looks like this:</p>

<p>sample stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/sserver
sserver</p>

<p>Since sample is normally not a port defined in
/etc/services, you will usually have to add a line to
/etc/services which looks like this:</p>

<p>sample 13135/tcp</p>

<p>When using sclient, you will first have to have an entry
in the Ker- beros database, by using kadmin(8), and then you
have to get Kerberos tickets, by using kinit(8). Also, if
you are running the sclient pro- gram on a different host
than the sserver it will be connecting to, be sure that both
hosts have an entry in /etc/services for the sample tcp
port, and that the same port number is in both files.</p>

<p>When you run sclient you should see something like
this:</p>

<p>sendauth succeeded, reply is: reply len 32, contents:
You are nlgilman@JIMI.MIT.EDU</p>

<p>COMMON ERROR MESSAGES 1) kinit returns the error:</p>

<p>kinit: Client not found in Kerberos database while
getting initial cre- dentials</p>

<p>This means that you didnt create an entry for your
username in the Kerberos database.</p>

<p>2) sclient returns the error:</p>

<p>unknown service sample/tcp; check /etc/services</p>

<p>This means that you dont have an entry in /etc/services
for the sample tcp port.</p>

<p>3) sclient returns the error:</p>

<p>connect: Connection refused</p>

<p>This probably means you didn t edit /etc/inetd.conf
correctly, or you didnt restart inetd after editing
inetd.conf.</p>

<p>4) sclient returns the error:</p>

<p>sclient: Server not found in Kerberos database while
using sendauth</p>

<p>This means that the
&quot;sample/hostname@LOCAL.REALM&quot; service was not
defined in the Kerberos database; it should be created using
kadmin, and a keytab file needs to be generated to make the
key for that ser- vice principal available for ssclient.</p>

<p>5) sclient returns the error:</p>

<p>sendauth rejected, error reply is: &quot; No such file
or directory&quot;</p>

<p>This probably means sserver couldnt find the keytab
file. It was probably not installed in the proper
directory.</p>
