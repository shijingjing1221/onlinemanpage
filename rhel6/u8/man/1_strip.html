<p>NAME strip - Discard symbols from object files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS strip [-F bfdname |--target=bfdname] [-I
bfdname |--input-target=bfdname] [-O bfdname
|--output-target=bfdname] [-s|--strip-all]
[-S|-g|-d|--strip-debug] [-K symbolname
|--keep-symbol=symbolname] [-N symbolname
|--strip-symbol=symbolname] [-w|--wildcard]
[-x|--discard-all] [-X |--discard-locals] [-R sectionname
|--remove-section=sectionname] [-o file]
[-p|--preserve-dates] [--keep-file-symbols]
[--only-keep-debug] [-v |--verbose] [-V|--version] [--help]
[--info] objfile...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU strip discards all symbols from object
files objfile. The list of object files may include
archives. At least one object file must be given.</p>

<p>strip modifies the files named in its argument, rather
than writing modified copies under different names.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -F bfdname --target=bfdname Treat the original
objfile as a file with the object code format bfdname, and
rewrite it in the same format.</p>

<p>--help Show a summary of the options to strip and
exit.</p>

<p>--info Display a list showing all architectures and
object formats available.</p>

<p>-I bfdname --input-target=bfdname Treat the original
objfile as a file with the object code format bfdname.</p>

<p>-O bfdname --output-target=bfdname Replace objfile with
a file in the output format bfdname.</p>

<p>-R sectionname --remove-section=sectionname Remove any
section named sectionname from the output file. This option
may be given more than once. Note that using this option
inappropriately may make the output file unusable.</p>

<p>-s --strip-all Remove all symbols.</p>

<p>-g -S -d --strip-debug Remove debugging symbols
only.</p>

<p>--strip-unneeded Remove all symbols that are not needed
for relocation processing.</p>

<p>-K symbolname --keep-symbol=symbolname When stripping
symbols, keep symbol symbolname even if it would normally be
stripped. This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>-N symbolname --strip-symbol=symbolname Remove symbol
symbolname from the source file. This option may be given
more than once, and may be combined with strip options other
than -K.</p>

<p>-o file Put the stripped output in file, rather than
replacing the existing file. When this argument is used,
only one objfile argument may be specified.</p>

<p>-p --preserve-dates Preserve the access and modification
dates of the file.</p>

<p>-w --wildcard Permit regular expressions in symbolnames
used in other command line options. The question mark (?),
asterisk (*), backslash ( and square brackets ([]) operators
can be used anywhere in the symbol name. If the first
character of the symbol name is the exclamation point (!)
then the sense of the switch is reversed for that symbol.
For example:</p>

<p>-w -K !foo -K fo*</p>

<p>would cause strip to only keep symbols that start with
the letters &quot;fo&quot;, but to discard the symbol
&quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p>-x --discard-all Remove non-global symbols.</p>

<p>-X --discard-locals Remove compiler-generated local
symbols. (These usually start with L or ..)</p>

<p>--keep-file-symbols When stripping a file, perhaps with
--strip-debug or --strip-unneeded, retain any symbols
specifying source file names, which would otherwise get
stripped.</p>

<p>--only-keep-debug Strip a file, removing contents of any
sections that would not be stripped by --strip-debug and
leaving the debugging sections intact. In ELF files, this
preserves all note sections in the output.</p>

<p>The intention is that this option will be used in
conjunction with --add-gnu-debuglink to create a two part
executable. One a stripped binary which will occupy less
space in RAM and in a distribution and the second a
debugging information file which is only needed if debugging
abilities are required. The suggested procedure to create
these files is as follows:</p>

<p>1.&lt;Link the executable as normal. Assuming that is is
called&gt; &quot;foo&quot; then...</p>

<p>1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --only-keep-debug foo
foo.dbg&quot; to&gt; create a file containing the debugging
info.</p>

<p>1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --strip-debug foo&quot; to
create a&gt; stripped executable.</p>

<p>1.&lt;Run &quot;objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg
foo&quot;&gt; to add a link to the debugging info into the
stripped executable.</p>

<p>Note---the choice of &quot;.dbg&quot; as an extension
for the debug info file is arbitrary. Also the
&quot;--only-keep-debug&quot; step is optional. You could
instead do this:</p>

<p>1.&lt;Link the executable as normal.&gt; 1.&lt;Copy
&quot;foo&quot; to &quot;foo.full&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;Run
&quot;strip --strip-debug foo&quot;&gt; 1.&lt;Run
&quot;objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>i.e., the file pointed to by the --add-gnu-debuglink can
be the full executable. It does not have to be a file
created by the --only-keep-debug switch.</p>

<p>Note---this switch is only intended for use on fully
linked files. It does not make sense to use it on object
files where the debugging information may be incomplete.
Besides the gnu_debuglink feature currently only supports
the presence of one filename containing debugging
information, not multiple filenames on a one-
per-object-file basis.</p>

<p>-V --version Show the version number for strip.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Verbose output: list all object files
modified. In the case of archives, strip -v lists all
members of the archive.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
