<p>NAMEI(1) NAMEI(1)</p>

<p>NAME namei - follow a pathname until a terminal point is
found</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS namei [options] pathname...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Namei uses its arguments as pathnames to any
type of Unix file (sym- links, files, directories, and so
forth). Namei then follows each pathname until a terminal
point is found (a file, directory, char device, etc). If it
finds a symbolic link, we show the link, and start following
it, indenting the output to show the context.</p>

<p>This program is useful for finding a &quot;too many
levels of symbolic links&quot; problems.</p>

<p>For each line output, namei outputs a the following
characters to iden- tify the file types found:</p>

<p>f: = the pathname we are currently trying to resolve d =
directory l = symbolic link (both the link and its contents
are output) s = socket b = block device c = character device
p = FIFO (named pipe) - = regular file ? = an error of some
kind</p>

<p>Namei prints an informative message when the maximum
number of symbolic links this system can have has been
exceeded.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l, --long Use a long listing format (same as -m
-o -v).</p>

<p>-m, --modes Show the mode bits of each file type in the
style of ls(1), for example rwxr-xr-x.</p>

<p>-o, --owners Show owner and group name of each file.</p>

<p>-n, --nosymlinks Dont follow symlinks.</p>

<p>-v, --vertical Vertical align of modes and owners.</p>

<p>-x, --mountpoints Show mount point directories with a D,
rather than a d.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original namei program was written by Roger
Southwick &lt;rogers@amadeus.wr.tek.com&gt;.</p>

<p>The program was re-written by Karel Zak
&lt;kzak@redhat.com&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS To be discovered.</p>

util-linux-ng package and is available from
