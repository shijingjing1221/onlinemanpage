<p>NAME tftp - IPv4 Trivial File Transfer Protocol
client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tftp [ options... ] [host [port]] [-c
command]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tftp is a client for the Trivial file
Transfer Protocol, which can be used to transfer files to
and from remote machines, including some very minimalistic,
usually embedded, systems. The remote host may be speci-
fied on the command line, in which case tftp uses host as
the default host for future transfers (see the connect
command below.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS -4 Connect with IPv4 only, even if IPv6 support
was compiled in.</p>

<p>-6 Connect with IPv6 only, if compiled in.</p>

<p>-c command Execute command as if it had been entered on
the tftp prompt. Must be specified last on the command
line.</p>

<p>-l Default to literal mode. Used to avoid special
processing of : in a file name.</p>

<p>-m mode Set the default transfer mode to mode. This is
usually used with -c.</p>

<p>-R port:port Force the originating port number to be in
the specified range of port numbers.</p>

<p>-v Default to verbose mode.</p>

<p>-V Print the version number and configuration to
standard output, then exit gracefully.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Once tftp is running, it issues the prompt
tftp&gt; and recognizes the following commands:</p>

<p>? command-name...</p>

<p>help command-name... Print help information</p>

<p>ascii Shorthand for mode ascii.</p>

<p>binary Shorthand for mode binary.</p>

<p>connect host [port] Set the host (and optionally port)
for transfers. Note that the TFTP protocol, unlike the FTP
protocol, does not maintain con- nections between transfers;
thus, the connect command does not actually create a
connection, but merely remembers what host is to be used for
transfers. You do not have to use the connect command; the
remote host can be specified as part of the get or put
commands.</p>

<p>get file get remotefile localfile get file1 file2
file3... Get a file or set of files from the specified
sources. A remote filename can be in one of two forms: a
plain filename on the remote host, if the host has already
been specified, or a string of the form host:filename to
specify both a host and filename at the same time. If the
latter form is used, the last hostname specified becomes the
default for future transfers. Enable lit- eral mode to
prevent special treatment of the : character (e.g.
C:irle).</p>

<p>literal Toggle literal mode. When set, this mode
prevents special treatment of : in filenames.</p>

<p>mode transfer-mode Specify the mode for transfers;
transfer-mode may be one of ascii (or netascii) or binary
(or octet.) The default is ascii.</p>

<p>put file put localfile remotefile put file1 file2
file3... remote-directory Put a file or set of files to the
specified remote file or directory. The destination can be
in one of two forms: a file- name on the remote host, if the
host has already been specified, or a string of the form
host:filename to specify both a host and filename at the
same time. If the latter form is used, the hostname
specified becomes the default for future transfers. If the
remote-directory form is used, the remote host is assumed to
be a UNIX system or another system using / as directory
separa- tor. Enable literal mode to prevent special
treatment of the : character (e.g. C:irle).</p>

<p>quit Exit tftp. End-of-file will also exit.</p>

<p>rexmt retransmission-timeout Set the per-packet
retransmission timeout, in seconds.</p>

<p>status Show current status.</p>

<p>timeout total-transmission-timeout Set the total
transmission timeout, in seconds.</p>

<p>trace Toggle packet tracing (a debugging feature.)</p>

<p>verbose Toggle verbose mode.</p>

<p>NOTES The TFTP protocol provides no provisions for
authentication or secu- rity. Therefore, the remote server
will probably implement some kinds of access restriction or
firewalling. These access restrictions are likely to be
site- and server-specific.</p>

<p>AUTHOR This version of tftp is maintained by H. Peter
Anvin &lt;hpa@zytor.com&gt;. It was derived from, but has
substantially diverged from, an OpenBSD source base, with
added patches by Markus Gutschke and Gero Kulhman.</p>
