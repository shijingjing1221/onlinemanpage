<p>NAME zipgrep - search files in a ZIP archive for lines
matching a pattern</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zipgrep [egrep_options] pattern file[.zip]
[file(s) ...] [-x xfile(s) ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION zipgrep will search files within a ZIP
archive for lines matching the given string or pattern.
zipgrep is a shell script and requires egrep(1) and
unzip(1L) to function. Its output is identical to that of
egrep(1).</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS pattern The pattern to be located within a ZIP
archive. Any string or regular expression accepted by
egrep(1) may be used. file[.zip] Path of the ZIP archive.
(Wildcard expressions for the ZIP archive name are not
supported.) If the literal filename is not found, the suffix
.zip is appended. Note that self-extracting ZIP files are
sup- ported, as with any other ZIP archive; just specify the
.exe suffix (if any) explicitly.</p>

<p>[file(s)] An optional list of archive members to be
processed, sep- arated by spaces. If no member files are
specified, all members of the ZIP archive are searched.
Regular expres- sions (wildcards) may be used to match
multiple members:</p>

<p>* matches a sequence of 0 or more characters</p>

<p>? matches exactly 1 character</p>

<p>[...] matches any single character found inside the
brackets; ranges are specified by a beginning character, a
hyphen, and an ending character. If an exclamation point or
a caret (! or ^) fol- lows the left bracket, then the range
of charac- ters within the brackets is complemented (that
is, anything except the characters inside the brackets is
considered a match).</p>

<p>(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be
interpreted or modified by the operating system.)</p>

<p>[-x xfile(s)] An optional list of archive members to be
excluded from processing. Since wildcard characters match
directory separators (/), this option may be used to exclude
any files that are in subdirectories. For example, zipgrep
grumpy foo *.[ch] -x */* would search for the string grumpy
in all C source files in the main directory of the foo
archive, but none in any subdirectories. Without the -x
option, all C source files in all directo- ries within the
zipfile would be searched.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All options prior to the ZIP archive filename
are passed to egrep(1).</p>
