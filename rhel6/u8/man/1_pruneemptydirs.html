<p>NAME pruneemptydirs - Detects stale source directories
in a CVS tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pruneemptydirs [-f]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pruneemptydirs is used to clean up a local
CVS tree. It detects direc- tories containing remnants of
old stuff which has been removed from the CVS. Such stale
directories often break compilation. The current direc- tory
and all directories beneath it will be examined.</p>

<p>Note that this tool does not remove anything; it simply
prints what to do as a series of remove commands. You can
copy and paste these com- mands, or use them with eval in a
script.</p>

<p>This tool works better if the source directory is not
the same as the build directory, since it will not print
directories containing old ex- ecutables.</p>

<p>This utility is part of the KDE Software Development
Kit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Actually perform the deletions instead of
just printing them out. Use this option with care.</p>
