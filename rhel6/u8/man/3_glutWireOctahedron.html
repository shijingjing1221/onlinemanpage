<p>NAME glutWireOctahedron - Draw a wireframe
octahedron.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - geometry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutWireOctahedron(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function draws a regular wireframe
8-sided polyhedron centered at the origin. The vertices are
at (+/-1, 0, 0), (0, +/-1, 0), (0, 0, +/-1).</p>

<p>CAVEATS We visit the same vertices the same number of
times as for the solid octahedron, but the order is
different.</p>

<p>Draws every edge twice.</p>

<p>The lines have normals, but the normals are from the
facets, rather than upon the edge. If you squint too hard,
the lighting on a wireframe octa- hedron does not look quite
right.</p>

<p>TODO It may be faster (and look better) to draw each
edge once, setting the Normal at each edge. (I dont think
that this matters all that much, but a lineloop was proposed
for the wire Cube for speed.)</p>
