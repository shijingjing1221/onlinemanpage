<p>rlm_files(5) FreeRADIUS Module rlm_files(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_files - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_files module uses the users file for
accessing authorization information for users. Additionally,
it supports a users file syntax to be applied to the
accounting and pre-proxy sections.</p>

<p>The main configuration items to be aware of are:</p>

<p>usersfile The filename of the users file, which is
parsed during the authorization stage of this module.</p>

<p>acctusersfile The filename of the users file, which is
parsed during the accounting stage of this module.</p>

<p>preproxy_usersfile The filename of the users file, which
is parsed during the pre_proxy stage of this module.</p>

<p>compat This option allows FreeRADIUS to parse an old
style Cistron syn- tax. The default is no. If you need to
parse an old style Cistron file, set this option to
cistron.</p>

<p>key This option lets you set the attribute to use as a
key to find entries. The default is
&quot;%{Stripped-User-Name:-%{User-Name}}&quot;. Note that
the key MUST supply real data. Dynamic attributes like
&quot;Group&quot; will not work, because the
&quot;Group&quot; attribute can only be used as a
comparison, to see if a user is in a Unix group. It will not
return the name of the Unix group that a user is in.</p>

<p>If you want to use groups as a key, see the rlm_passwd,
which will cre- ate a real attribute that contains the group
name.</p>

<p>This configuration entry enables you to have
configurations that per- form per-group checks, and return
per-group attributes, where the group membership is
dynamically defined by a previous module. It also lets you
do things like key off of attributes in the reply, and
express policies like like &quot;when I send replies
containing attribute FOO with value BAR, do more checks, and
maybe send additional attributes&quot;.</p>
