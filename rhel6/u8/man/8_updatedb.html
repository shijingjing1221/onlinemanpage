<p>NAME updatedb - update a database for mlocate</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS updatedb [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION updatedb creates or updates a database used
by locate(1). If the database already exists, its data is
reused to avoid rereading directo- ries that have not
changed.</p>

<p>updatedb is usually run daily by cron(8) to update the
default database.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS updatedb returns with exit status 0 on
success, 1 on error.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS, PRUNEFS, PRUNENAMES and
PRUNEPATHS variables, which are modified by some of the
options, are documented in detail in updatedb.conf(5).</p>

<p>-f, --add-prunefs FS Add entries in
white-space-separated list FS to PRUNEFS.</p>

<p>-n, --add-prunenames NAMES Add entries in
white-space-separated list NAMES to PRUNENAMES.</p>

<p>-e, --add-prunepaths PATHS Add entries in
white-space-separated list PATHS to PRUNEPATHS.</p>

<p>-U, --database-root PATH Store only results of scanning
the file system subtree rooted at PATH to the generated
database. The whole file system is scanned by default.</p>

<p>locate(1) outputs entries as absolute path names which
dont contain symbolic links, regardless of the form of
PATH.</p>

<p>--debug-pruning Write debugging information about
pruning decisions to standard error output.</p>

<p>-h, --help Write a summary of the available options to
standard output and exit successfully.</p>

<p>-o, --output FILE Write the database to FILE instead of
using the default database.</p>

<p>--prune-bind-mounts FLAG Set PRUNE_BIND_MOUNTS to FLAG,
overriding the configuration file.</p>

<p>--prunefs FS Set PRUNEFS to FS, overriding the
configuration file.</p>

<p>--prunenames NAMES Set PRUNENAMES to NAMES, overriding
the configuration file.</p>

<p>--prunepaths PATHS Set PRUNEPATHS to PATHS, overriding
the configuration file.</p>

<p>-l, --require-visibility FLAG Set the require file
visibility before reporting it flag in the generated
database to FLAG.</p>

<p>If FLAG is 0 or no, or if the database file is readable
by &quot;oth- ers&quot; or it is not owned by slocate,
locate(1) outputs the database entries even if the user
running locate(1) could not have read the directory
necessary to find out the file described by the database
entry.</p>

<p>If FLAG is 1 or yes (the default), locate(1) checks the
permis- sions of parent directories of each entry before
reporting it to the invoking user. To make the file
existence truly hidden from other users, the database group
is set to slocate and the database permissions prohibit
reading the database by users using other means than
locate(1), which is set-gid slocate.</p>

<p>Note that the visibility flag is checked only if the
database is owned by slocate and it is not readable by
&quot;others&quot;.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Output path names of files to standard
output, as soon as they are found.</p>

<p>-V, --version Write information about the version and
licence of locate on standard output and exit
successfully.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To create a private mlocate database as an user
other than root, run updatedb -l 0 -o db_file -U
source_directory Note that all users that can read db_file
can get the complete list of files in the subtree of
source_directory.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/updatedb.conf A configuration file. See
updatedb.conf(5).</p>

<p>/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db The database updated by
default.</p>

<p>SECURITY Databases built with --require-visibility no
allow users to find names of files and directories of other
users, which they would not otherwise be able to do.</p>

<p>NOTES The accompanying locate(1) utility was designed to
be compatible to slocate and attempts to be compatible to
GNU locate where possible. This is not the case for
updatedb.</p>
