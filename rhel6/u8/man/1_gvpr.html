<p>GVPR(1) GVPR(1)</p>

<p>NAME gvpr - graph pattern scanning and processing
language ( previously known as gpr )</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gvpr [-icqV?] [ -o outfile ] [ -a args ] [
prog_ | -f progfile ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gvpr is a graph stream editor inspired by
awk. It copies input graphs to its output, possibly
transforming their structure and attributes, creating new
graphs, or printing arbitrary information. The graph model
is that provided by libcgraph(3). In particular, gvpr reads
and writes graphs using the dot language.</p>

<p>Basically, gvpr traverses each input graph, denoted by
$G, visiting each node and edge, matching it with the
predicate-action rules sup- plied in the input program. The
rules are evaluated in order. For each predicate evaluating
to true, the corresponding action is per- formed. During the
traversal, the current node or edge being visited is denoted
by $.</p>

<p>For each input graph, there is a target subgraph,
denoted by $T, ini- tially empty and used to accumulate
chosen entities, and an output graph, $O, used for final
processing and then written to output. By default, the
output graph is the target graph. The output graph can be
set in the program or, in a limited sense, on the command
line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-a args The string args is split into
whitespace-separated tokens, with the individual tokens
available as strings in the gvpr program as
ARGV[0],...,ARGV[ARGC-1]. Whitespace characters within sin-
gle or double quoted substrings, or preceded by a backslash,
are ignored as separators. In general, a backslash character
turns off any special meaning of the following character.
Note that the tokens derived from multiple -a flags are
concatenated.</p>

<p>-c Use the source graph as the output graph.</p>

<p>-i Derive the node-induced subgraph extension of the
output graph in the context of its root graph.</p>

<p>-o outfile Causes the output stream to be written to the
specified file; by default, output is written to stdout.</p>

<p>-f progfile Use the contents of the specified file as
the program to execute on the input. If progfile contains a
slash character, the name is taken as the pathname of the
file. Otherwise, gvpr will use the directories specified in
the environment variable GPRPATH to look for the file. If -f
is not given, gvpr will use the first non-option argument as
the program.</p>

<p>-q Turns off warning messages.</p>

<p>-V Causes the program to print version information and
exit.</p>

<p>-? Causes the program to print usage information and
exit.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in the
dot language. If no -f option is given, the first name is
removed from the list and used as the input program. If the
list of files is empty, stdin will be used.</p>

<p>PROGRAMS A gvpr program consists of a list of
predicate-action clauses, having one of the forms:</p>

<p>BEGIN { action }</p>

<p>BEG_G { action }</p>

<p>N [ predicate ] { action }</p>

<p>E [ predicate ] { action }</p>

<p>END_G { action }</p>

<p>END { action }</p>

<p>A program can contain at most one of each of the BEGIN,
END_G and END clauses. There can be any number of BEG_G, N
and E statements, the first applied to graphs, the second to
nodes, the third to edges. These are separated into blocks,
a block consisting of an optional BEG_G statement and all N
and E statements up to the next BEG_G state- ment, if any.
The top-level semantics of a gvpr program are:</p>

<p>Evaluate the BEGIN clause, if any. For each input graph
G { For each block { Set G as the current graph and current
object. Evaluate the BEG_G clause, if any. For each node and
edge in G { Set the node or edge as the current object.
Evaluate the N or E clauses, as appropriate. } } Set G as
the current object. Evaluate the END_G clause, if any. }
Evaluate the END clause, if any.</p>

<p>The actions of the BEGIN, BEG_G, END_G and END clauses
are performed when the clauses are evaluated. For N or E
clauses, either the predi- cate or action may be omitted. If
there is no predicate with an action, the action is
performed on every node or edge, as appropriate. If there is
no action and the predicate evaluates to true, the associ-
ated node or edge is added to the target graph.</p>

<p>The blocks are evaluated in the order in which they
occur. Within a block, the N clauses (E clauses,
respectively) are evaluated in the order in which the occur.
Note, though, that within a block, N or E clauses may be
interlaced, depending on the traversal order.</p>

<p>Predicates and actions are sequences of statements in
the C dialect supported by the libexpr(3) library. The only
difference between pred- icates and actions is that the
former must have a type that may inter- preted as either
true or false. Here the usual C convention is fol- lowed, in
which a non-zero value is considered true. This would
include non-empty strings and non-empty references to nodes,
edges, etc. How- ever, if a string can be converted to an
integer, this value is used.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual C base types (void, int, char,
float, long, unsigned and double), gvpr provides string as a
synonym for char*, and the graph-based types node_t, edge_t,
graph_t and obj_t. The obj_t type can be viewed as a
supertype of the other 3 concrete types; the correct base
type is maintained dynamically. Besides these base types,
the only other supported type expressions are (associative)
arrays.</p>

<p>Constants follow C syntax, but strings may be quoted
with either &quot;...&quot; or ... . In certain contexts,
string values are interpreted as pat- terns for the purpose
of regular expression matching. Patterns use ksh(1) file
match pattern syntax. gvpr accepts C++ comments as well as
cpp-type comments. For the latter, if a line begins with a #
charac- ter, the rest of the line is ignored.</p>

<p>A statement can be a declaration of a function, a
variable or an array, or an executable statement. For
declarations, there is a single scope. Array declarations
have the form:</p>

<p>type array [ type0 ]</p>

<p>where type0 is optional. If it is supplied, the parser
will enforce that all array subscripts have the specified
type. If it is not sup- plied, objects of all types can be
used as subscripts. As in C, vari- ables and arrays must be
declared. In particular, an undeclared vari- able will be
interpreted as the name of an attribute of a node, edge or
graph, depending on the context.</p>

<p>Executable statements can be one of the following: { [
statement ... ] } expression // commonly var = expression
if( expression ) statement [ else statement ] for(
expression ; expression ; expression ) statement for( array
[ var ]) statement forr( array [ var ]) statement while(
expression ) statement switch( expression ) case statements
break [ expression ] continue [ expression ] return [
expression ] Items in brackets are optional.</p>

<p>In the second form of the for statement and the forr
statement, the variable var is set to each value used as an
index in the specified array and then the associated
statement is evaluated. For numeric and string indices, the
indices are returned in increasing (decreasing) numeric or
lexicographic order for for (forr, respectively). This can
be used for sorting.</p>

<p>Function definitions can only appear in the BEGIN
clause.</p>

<p>Expressions include the usual C expressions. String
comparisons using == and != treat the right hand operand as
a pattern. gvpr will attempt to use an expression as a
string or numeric value as appropriate.</p>

<p>Expressions of graphical type (i.e., graph_t, node_t,
edge_t, obj_t) may be followed by a field reference in the
form of .name. The result- ing value is the value of the
attribute named name of the given object. In addition, in
certain contexts an undeclared, unmodified identifier is
taken to be an attribute name. Specifically, such
identifiers denote attributes of the current node or edge,
respectively, in N and E clauses, and the current graph in
BEG_G and END_G clauses.</p>

<p>As usual in the libcgraph(3) model, attributes are
string-valued. In addition, gvpr supports certain
pseudo-attributes of graph objects, not necessarily
string-valued. These reflect intrinsic properties of the
graph objects and cannot be set by the user.</p>

<p>head : node_t the head of an edge.</p>

<p>tail : node_t the tail of an edge.</p>

<p>name : string the name of an edge, node or graph. The
name of an edge has the form
&quot;&lt;tail-name&gt;&lt;edge-op&gt;&lt;head-name&gt;[&lt;key&gt;]&quot;,
where &lt;edge-op&gt; is &quot;-&gt;&quot; or &quot;--&quot;
depending on whether the graph is directed or not. The
bracket part [&lt;key&gt;] only appears if the edge has a
non-trivial key.</p>

<p>indegree : int the indegree of a node.</p>

<p>outdegree : int the outdegree of a node.</p>

<p>degree : int the degree of a node.</p>

<p>root : graph_t the root graph of an object. The root of
a root graph is itself.</p>

<p>parent : graph_t the parent graph of a subgraph. The
parent of a root graph is NULL</p>

<p>n_edges : int the number of edges in the graph</p>

<p>n_nodes : int the number of nodes in the graph</p>

<p>directed : int true (non-zero) if the graph is
directed</p>

<p>strict : int true (non-zero) if the graph is strict</p>

<p>BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS The following functions are built
into gvpr. Those functions returning references to graph
objects return NULL in case of failure.</p>

<p>Graphs and subgraph graph(s : string, t : string) :
graph_t creates a graph whose name is s and whose type is
specified by the string t. Ignoring case, the characters U,
D, S, N have the interpretation undirected, directed,
strict, and non-strict, respectively. If t is empty, a
directed, non-strict graph is generated.</p>

<p>subg(g : graph_t, s : string) : graph_t creates a
subgraph in graph g with name s. If the subgraph already
exists, it is returned.</p>

<p>isSubg(g : graph_t, s : string) : graph_t returns the
subgraph in graph g with name s, if it exists, or NULL
otherwise.</p>

<p>fstsubg(g : graph_t) : graph_t returns the first
subgraph in graph g, or NULL if none exists.</p>

<p>nxtsubg(sg : graph_t) : graph_t returns the next
subgraph after sg, or NULL.</p>

<p>isDirect(g : graph_t) : int returns true if and only if

creates an edge with tail node t, head node h and name s in
the root graph. If the graph is undirected, the distinction
between head and tail nodes is unimportant. If such an edge
already exists, it is returned.</p>

<p>edge_sg(sg : graph_t, t : node_t, h : node_t, s :
string) : edge_t creates an edge with tail node t, head node
h and name s in (sub)graph sg (and all parent graphs). If
the graph is undi- rected, the distinction between head and
tail nodes is unimpor- tant. If such an edge already exists,
it is returned.</p>

<p>subedge(g : graph_t, e : edge_t) : edge_t inserts the
edge e into the subgraph g. Returns the edge.</p>

<p>isEdge(t : node_t, h : node_t, s : string) : edge_t
looks for an edge with tail node t, head node h and name s.
If the graph is undirected, the distinction between head and
tail nodes is unimportant. If such an edge exists, it is
returned. Otherwise, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>isEdge_sg(sg : graph_t, t : node_t, h : node_t, s :
string) : edge_t looks for an edge with tail node t, head
node h and name s in (sub)graph sg. If the graph is
undirected, the distinction between head and tail nodes is
unimportant. If such an edge exists, it is returned.
Otherwise, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>isSubedge(g : graph_t, e : edge_t) : int returns
non-zero if edge e is in (sub)graph sg, or zero other-
wise.</p>

<p>fstout(n : node_t) : edge_t returns the first outedge of
node n in the root graph.</p>

<p>fstout_sg(sg : graph_t, n : node_t) : edge_t returns the
first outedge of node n in (sub)graph sg.</p>

after e in the root graph.</p>

<p>nxtout_sg(sg : graph_t, e : edge_t) : edge_t returns the
next outedge after e in graph sg.</p>

<p>nxtedge_sg(sg : graph_t, e : edge_t, node_t) : edge_t
returns the next edge after e in the graph sg.</p>

<p>Graph I/O write(g : graph_t) : void prints g in dot
format onto the output stream.</p>

<p>writeG(g : graph_t, fname : string) : void prints g in
dot format into the file fname.</p>

<p>fwriteG(g : graph_t, fd : int) : void prints g in dot
format onto the open stream denoted by the inte- ger fd.</p>

<p>readG(fname : string) : graph_t returns a graph read
from the file fname. The graph should be in dot format. If
no graph can be read, NULL is returned.</p>

<p>freadG(fd : int) : graph_t returns the next graph read
from the open stream fd. Returns NULL at end of file.</p>

<p>Graph miscellany delete(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : void
deletes object x from graph g. If g is NULL, the function
uses the root graph of x. If x is a graph or subgraph, it is
closed unless x is locked.</p>

<p>isIn(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : int returns true if x is
in subgraph g.</p>

<p>clone(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : obj_t creates a clone of
object x in graph g. In particular, the new object has the
same name/value attributes and structure as the original
object. If an object with the same key as x already exists,
its attributes are overlaid by those of x and the object is
returned. If an edge is cloned, both endpoints are
implicitly cloned. If a graph is cloned, all nodes, edges
and subgraphs are implicitly cloned. If x is a graph, g may
be NULL, in which case the cloned object will be a new root
graph.</p>

<p>copy(g : graph_t, x : obj_t) : obj_t creates a copy of
object x in graph g, where the new object has the same
name/value attributes as the original object. If an object
with the same key as x already exists, its attributes are
overlaid by those of x and the object is returned. Note that
this is a shallow copy. If x is a graph, none of its nodes,
edges or subgraphs are copied into the new graph. If x is an
edge, the endpoints are created if necessary, but they are
not cloned. If x is a graph, g may be NULL, in which case
the cloned object will be a new root graph.</p>

<p>copyA(src : obj_t, tgt : obj_t) : int copies the
attributes of object src to object tgt, overwriting any
attribute values tgt may initially have.</p>

<p>induce(g : graph_t) : void extends g to its node-induced
subgraph extension in its root graph.</p>

<p>hasAttr(src : obj_t, name : string) : int returns
non-zero if object src has an attribute whose name is name.
It returns 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>isAttr(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string) : int
returns non-zero if an attribute name has been defined in g
for objects of the given kind. For nodes, edges, and graphs,
kind should be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and
&quot;G&quot;, respectively. It returns 0 other- wise.</p>

<p>aget(src : obj_t, name : string) : string returns the
value of attribute name in object src. This is use- ful for
those cases when name conflicts with one of the keywords
such as &quot;head&quot; or &quot;root&quot;. If the
attribute has not been declared in the graph, the function
will initialize it with a default value of &quot;&quot;. To
avoid this, one should use the hasAttr or isAttr function to
check that the attribute exists.</p>

<p>aset(src : obj_t, name : string, value : string) : int
sets the value of attribute name in object src to value.
Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure. See aget
above.</p>

<p>getDflt(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string) :
string returns the default value of attribute name in
objects in g of the given kind. For nodes, edges, and
graphs, kind should be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and
&quot;G&quot;, respectively. If the attribute has not been
declared in the graph, the function will initialize it with
a default value of &quot;&quot;. To avoid this, one should
use the isAttr function to check that the attribute
exists.</p>

<p>setDflt(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string, value
: string) : int sets the default value of attribute name to
value in objects in g of the given kind. For nodes, edges,
and graphs, kind should be &quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and
&quot;G&quot;, respectively. Returns 0 on success, non-zero
on failure. See getDflt above.</p>

<p>fstAttr(g : graph_t, kind : string) : string returns the
name of the first attribute of objects in g of the given
kind. For nodes, edges, and graphs, kind should be
&quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;,
respectively. If there are no attributes, the string
&quot;&quot; is returned.</p>

<p>nxtAttr(g : graph_t, kind : string, name : string) :
string returns the name of the next attribute of objects in
g of the given kind after the attribute name. The argument
name must be the name of an existing attribute; it will
typically be the return value of an previous call to fstAttr
or nxtAttr. For nodes, edges, and graphs, kind should be
&quot;N&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;,
respectively. If there are no attributes left, the string
&quot;&quot; is returned.</p>

<p>compOf(g : graph_t, n : node_t) : graph_t returns the
connected component of the graph g containing node n, as a
subgraph of g. The subgraph only contains the nodes. One can
use induce to add the edges. The function fails and returns
NULL if n is not in g. Connectivity is based on the
underlying undirected graph of g.</p>

<p>kindOf(obj : obj_t) : string returns an indication of
what kind of graph object is the argu- ment. For nodes,
edges, and graphs, it returns should be &quot;N&quot;,
&quot;E&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;, respectively.</p>

<p>lock(g : graph_t, v : int) : int implements graph
locking on root graphs. If the integer v is positive, the
graph is set so that future calls to delete have no
immediate effect. If v is zero, the graph is unlocked. If
there has been a call to delete the graph while it was
locked, the graph is closed. If v is negative, nothing is
done. In all cases, the previous lock value is returned.</p>

<p>Strings sprintf(fmt : string, ...) : string returns the
string resulting from formatting the values of the
expressions occurring after fmt according to the printf(3)
for- mat fmt</p>

<p>gsub(str : string, pat : string) : string</p>

<p>gsub(str : string, pat : string, repl : string) : string
returns str with all substrings matching pat deleted or
replaced by repl, respectively.</p>

<p>sub(str : string, pat : string) : string</p>

<p>sub(str : string, pat : string, repl : string) : string
returns str with the leftmost substring matching pat deleted
or replaced by repl, respectively. The characters ^ and $
may be used at the beginning and end, respectively, of pat
to anchor the pattern to the beginning or end of str.</p>

<p>substr(str : string, idx : int) : string</p>

<p>substr(str : string, idx : int, len : int) : string
returns the substring of str starting at position idx to the
end of the string or of length len, respectively. Indexing
starts at 0. If idx is negative or idx is greater than the
length of str, a fatal error occurs. Similarly, in the
second case, if len is negative or idx + len is greater than
the length of str, a fatal error occurs.</p>

<p>length(s : string) : int returns the length of the
string s.</p>

<p>index(s : string, t : string) : int</p>

<p>rindex(s : string, t : string) : int returns the index
of the character in string s where the left- most
(rightmost) copy of string t can be found, or -1 if t is not
a substring of s.</p>

<p>match(s : string, p : string) : int returns the index of
the character in string s where the left- most match of
pattern p can be found, or -1 if no substring of s matches
p.</p>

<p>toupper(s : string) : string returns a version of s with
the alphabetic characters converted to upper-case.</p>

<p>tolower(s : string) : string returns a version of s with
the alphabetic characters converted to lower-case.</p>

<p>canon(s : string) : string returns a version of s
appropriate to be used as an identifier in a dot file.</p>

<p>xOf(s : string) : string returns the string
&quot;x&quot; if s has the form &quot;x,y&quot;, where both
x and y are numeric.</p>

<p>yOf(s : string) : string returns the string
&quot;y&quot; if s has the form &quot;x,y&quot;, where both
x and y are numeric.</p>

<p>llOf(s : string) : string returns the string
&quot;llx,lly&quot; if s has the form
&quot;llx,lly,urx,ury&quot;, where all of llx, lly, urx, and
ury are numeric.</p>

<p>urOf(s) urOf(s : string) : string returns the string
&quot;urx,ury&quot; if s has the form
&quot;llx,lly,urx,ury&quot;, where all of llx, lly, urx, and
ury are numeric.</p>

<p>sscanf(s : string, fmt : string, ...) : int scans the
string s, extracting values according to the sscanf(3)
format fmt. The values are stored in the addresses following
fmt, addresses having the form &amp;v, where v is some
declared variable of the correct type. Returns the number of
items suc- cessfully scanned.</p>

<p>split(s : string, arr : array, seps : string) : int</p>

<p>split(s : string, arr : array) : int</p>

<p>tokens(s : string, arr : array, seps : string) : int</p>

<p>tokens(s : string, arr : array) : int The split function
breaks the string s into fields, while the tokens function
breaks the string into tokens. A field consists of all
non-separator characters between two separator characters or
the beginning or end of the string. Thus, a field may be the
empty string. A token is a maximal, non-empty substring not
con- taining a separator character. The separator characters
are those given in the seps argument. If seps is not
provided, the default value is &quot; 0. The functions
return the number of fields or tokens.</p>

<p>The fields and tokens are stored in the argument array.
The array must be string-valued and, if an index type is
specified, it must be int. The entries are indexed by
consecutive integers, starting at 0. Any values already
stored in the array will be either overwritten, or still be
present after the function returns.</p>

<p>I/O print(...) : void print( expr, ... ) prints a string
representation of each argu- ment in turn onto stdout,
followed by a newline.</p>

<p>printf(fmt : string, ...) : int</p>

<p>printf(fd : int, fmt : string, ...) : int prints the
string resulting from formatting the values of the
expressions following fmt according to the printf(3) format
fmt. Returns 0 on success. By default, it prints on stdout.
If the optional integer fd is given, output is written on
the open stream associated with fd.</p>

<p>scanf(fmt : string, ...) : int</p>

<p>scanf(fd : int, fmt : string, ...) : int scans in values
from an input stream according to the scanf(3) format fmt.
The values are stored in the addresses following fmt,
addresses having the form &amp;v, where v is some declared
variable of the correct type. By default, it reads from
stdin. If the optional integer fd is given, input is read
from the open stream associated with fd. Returns the number
of items success- fully scanned.</p>

<p>openF(s : string, t : string) : int opens the file s as
an I/O stream. The string argument t speci- fies how the
file is opened. The arguments are the same as for the C
function fopen(3). It returns an integer denoting the
stream, or -1 on error.</p>

<p>As usual, streams 0, 1 and 2 are already open as stdin,
stdout, and stderr, respectively. Since gvpr may use stdin
to read the input graphs, the user should avoid using this
stream.</p>

<p>closeF(fd : int) : int closes the open stream denoted by
the integer fd. Streams 0, 1 and 2 cannot be closed. Returns
0 on success.</p>

<p>readL(fd : int) : string returns the next line read from
the input stream fd. It returns the empty string
&quot;&quot; on end of file. Note that the newline char-
acter is left in the returned string.</p>

<p>Math exp(d : double) : double returns e to the dth
power.</p>

<p>log(d : double) : double returns the natural log of
d.</p>

<p>sqrt(d : double) : double returns the square root of the
double d.</p>

<p>pow(d : double, x : double) : double returns d raised to
the xth power.</p>

<p>cos(d : double) : double returns the cosine of d.</p>

<p>sin(d : double) : double returns the sine of d.</p>

<p>atan2(y : double, x : double) : double returns the
arctangent of y/x in the range -pi to pi.</p>

<p>MIN(y : double, x : double) : double returns the minimum
of y and x.</p>

<p>MAX(y : double, x : double) : double returns the maximum
of y and x.</p>

<p>Associative Arrays # arr : int returns the number of
elements in the array arr.</p>

<p>idx in arr : int returns 1 if a value has been set for
index idx in the array arr. It returns 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>unset(v : array, IidxP) : int removes the item indexed
by idx. It returns 1 if the item existed, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>unset(v : array) : void re-initializes the array.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous exit(v : int) : void causes gvpr to exit
with the exit code v.</p>

<p>system(cmd : string) : int provides the standard C
function system(3). It executes cmd if the user s shell
environment, and returns the exit status of the shell.</p>

<p>rand() : double returns a pseudo-random double between 0
and 1.</p>

<p>srand() : int</p>

<p>srand(v : int) : int sets a seed for the random number
generator. The optional argu- ment gives the seed; if it is
omitted, the current time is used. The previous seed value
is returned. srand should be called before any calls to
rand.</p>

<p>colorx(color : string, fmt : string) : string translates
a color from one format to another. The color argu- ment
should be a color in one of the recognized string represen-
tations. The fmt value should be one of &quot;RGB&quot;,
&quot;RGBA&quot;, &quot;HSV&quot;, &quot;HSVA&quot;, or
&quot;CMYK&quot;. An empty string is returned on error.</p>

<p>BUILT-IN VARIABLES gvpr provides certain special,
built-in variables, whose values are set automatically by
gvpr depending on the context. Except as noted, the user
cannot modify their values.</p>

<p>$ : obj_t denotes the current object (node, edge, graph)
depending on the context. It is not available in BEGIN or
END clauses.</p>

<p>$F : string is the name of the current input file.</p>

<p>$G : graph_t denotes the current graph being processed.
It is not available in BEGIN or END clauses.</p>

<p>$O : graph_t denotes the output graph. Before graph
traversal, it is initial- ized to the target graph. After
traversal and any END_G actions, if it refers to a non-empty
graph, that graph is printed onto the output stream. It is
only valid in N, E and END_G clauses. The output graph may
be set by the user.</p>

<p>$T : graph_t denotes the current target graph. It is a
subgraph of $G and is available only in N, E and END_G
clauses.</p>

<p>$tgtname : string denotes the name of the target graph.
By default, it is set to &quot;gvpr_result&quot;. If used
multiple times during the execution of gvpr, the name will
be appended with an integer. This variable may be set by the
user.</p>

<p>$tvroot : node_t indicates the starting node for a
(directed or undirected) depth-first traversal of the graph
(cf. $tvtype below). The default value is NULL for each
input graph.</p>

<p>$tvedge : edge_t For BFS and DFS traversals, this is set
to the edge used to arrive at the current node or edge. At
the beginning of a traversal, or for other traversal types,
the value is NULL.</p>

<p>$tvtype : tvtype_t indicates how gvpr traverses a graph.
It can only take one of the constant values with the previx
&quot;TV_&quot; described below. TV_flat is the default.</p>

<p>In the underlying graph library cgraph(3), edges in
undirected graphs are given an arbitrary direction. This is
used for traversals, such as TV_fwd, requiring directed
edges.</p>

<p>ARGC : int denotes the number of arguments specified by
the -a args com- mand-line argument.</p>

<p>ARGV : string array denotes the array of arguments
specified by the -a args com- mand-line argument. The ith
argument is given by ARGV[i].</p>

<p>BUILT-IN CONSTANTS There are several symbolic constants
defined by gvpr.</p>

<p>NULL : obj_t a null object reference, equivalent to
0.</p>

<p>TV_flat : tvtype_t a simple, flat traversal, with graph
objects visited in seem- ingly arbitrary order.</p>

<p>TV_ne : tvtype_t a traversal which first visits all of
the nodes, then all of the edges.</p>

<p>TV_en : tvtype_t a traversal which first visits all of
the edges, then all of the nodes.</p>

<p>TV_dfs : tvtype_t TV_postdfs : tvtype_t TV_prepostdfs :
tvtype_t a traversal of the graph using a depth-first search
on the underlying undirected graph. To do the traversal,
gvpr will check the value of $tvroot. If this has the same
value that it had previously (at the start, the previous
value is initialized to NULL.), gvpr will simply look for
some unvisited node and traverse its connected component. On
the other hand, if $tvroot has changed, its connected
component will be toured, assuming it has not been
previously visited or, if $tvroot is NULL, the traversal
will stop. Note that using TV_dfs and $tvroot, it is
possible to create an infinite loop.</p>

<p>By default, the traversal is done in pre-order. That is,
a node is visited before all of its unvisited edges. For
TV_postdfs, all of a nodes unvisited edges are visited
before the node. For TV_prepostdfs, a node is visited twice,
before and after all of its unvisited edges.</p>

<p>TV_fwd : tvtype_t TV_postfwd : tvtype_t TV_prepostfwd :
tvtype_t A traversal of the graph using a depth-first search
on the graph following only forward arcs. The choice of
roots for the traversal is the same as described for TV_dfs
above. The dif- ferent order of visitation specified by
TV_fwd, TV_postfwd and TV_prepostfwd are the same as those
specified by the analogous traversals TV_dfs, TV_postdfs and
TV_prepostdfs.</p>

<p>TV_rev : tvtype_t TV_postrev : tvtype_t TV_prepostrev :
tvtype_t A traversal of the graph using a depth-first search
on the graph following only reverse arcs. The choice of
roots for the traversal is the same as described for TV_dfs
above. The dif- ferent order of visitation specified by
TV_rev, TV_postrev and TV_prepostrev are the same as those
specified by the analogous traversals TV_dfs, TV_postdfs and
TV_prepostdfs.</p>

<p>TV_bfs : tvtype_t A traversal of the graph using a
bread-first search on the graph ignoring edge directions.
See the item on TV_dfs above for the role of $tvroot.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES gvpr -iN[color==&quot;blue&quot;]file.dot</p>

<p>Generate the node-induced subgraph of all nodes with
color blue.</p>

<p>gvpr -cN[color==&quot;blue&quot;]{color =
&quot;red&quot;}file.dot</p>

<p>Make all blue nodes red.</p>

<p>BEGIN { int n, e; int tot_n = 0; int tot_e = 0; } BEG_G
{ n = nNodes($G); e = nEdges($G); printf (&quot;%d nodes %d
edges %s0, n, e, $G.name); tot_n += n; tot_e += e; } END {
printf (&quot;%d nodes %d edges total0, tot_n, tot_e) }</p>

<p>Version of the program gc.</p>

<p>gvpr -c &quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Equivalent to nop.</p>

<p>BEG_G { graph_t g = graph (&quot;merge&quot;,
&quot;S&quot;); } E { node_t h = clone(g,$.head); node_t t =
clone(g,$.tail); edge_t e = edge(t,h,&quot;&quot;); e.weight
= e.weight + 1; } END_G { $O = g; }</p>

<p>Produces a strict version of the input graph, where the
weight attribute of an edge indicates how many edges from
the input graph the edge represents.</p>

<p>BEGIN {node_t n; int deg[]} E{deg[head]++; deg[tail]++;
} END_G { for (deg[n]) { printf (&quot;deg[%s] = %d0,
n.name, deg[n]); } }</p>

<p>Computes the degrees of nodes with edges.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GPRPATH Colon-separated list of directories
to be searched to find the file specified by the -f
option.</p>

<p>BUGS AND WARNINGS When the program is given as a command
line argument, the usual shell interpretation takes place,
which may affect some of the special names in gvpr. To avoid
this, it is best to wrap the program in single quotes.</p>

<p>As of 24 April 2008, gvpr switched to using a new,
underlying graph library, which uses the simpler model that
there is only one copy of a node, not one copy for each
subgraph logically containing it. This means that iterators
such as InxtnodeP cannot traverse a subgraph using just a
node argument. For this reason, subgraph traversal requires
new functions ending in &quot;_sg&quot;, which also take a
subgraph argument. The versions without that suffix will
always traverse the root graph.</p>

<p>There is a single global scope, except for formal
function parameters, and even these can interfere with the
type system. Also, the extent of all variables is the entire
life of the program. It might be prefer- able for scope to
reflect the natural nesting of the clauses, or for the
program to at least reset locally declared variables. For
now, it is advisable to use distinct names for all
variables.</p>

<p>If a function ends with a complex statement, such as an
IF statement, with each branch doing a return, type checking
may fail. Functions should use a return at the end.</p>

<p>The expr library does not support string values of
(char*)0. This means we cant distinguish between
&quot;&quot; and (char*)0 edge keys. For the purposes of
looking up and creating edges, we translate &quot;&quot; to
be (char*)0, since this latter value is necessary in order
to look up any edge with a matching head and tail.</p>

<p>Related to this, strings converted to integers act like
char pointers, getting the value 0 or 1 depending on whether
the string consists solely of zeroes or not. Thus, the
((int)&quot;2&quot;) evaluates to 1.</p>

<p>The language inherits the usual C problems such as
dangling references and the confusion between = and ==.</p>
