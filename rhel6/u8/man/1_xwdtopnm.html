<p>NAME xwdtopnm - convert an X11 or X10 window dump file
to a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xwdtopnm [-verbose] [-headerdump] [xwdfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>xwdtopnm reads an X11 or X10 window dump file as input
and produces a PNM image as output. The type of the output
image depends on the input file - if its black and white,
the output is PBM. If its grayscale, the output is PGM.
Otherwise, its PPM. The program tells you which type it is
writing.</p>

<p>Using this program, you can convert anything you can
display on an X workstations screen into a PNM image. Just
display whatever youre interested in, run the xwd program to
capture the contents of the win- dow, run it through
xwdtopnm, and then use pamcut to select the part you
want.</p>

<p>Note that a pseudocolor XWD image (typically what you
get when you make a dump of a pseudocolor X window) has
maxval 65535, which means the PNM file that xwdtopnm
generates has maxval 65535. Many older image pro- cessing
programs (that arent part of the Netpbm package and dont use
the Netpbm programming library) dont know how to handle a
PNM image with maxval greater than 255 (because there are
two bytes instead of one for each sample in the image). So
you may want to run the output of xwdtopnm through pamdepth
before feeding it to one of these old pro- grams.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -verbose This option causes xwdtopnm to display
handy information about the input image and the conversion
process</p>

<p>-headerdump This option causes xwdtopnm to display the
contents of the X11 header. It has no effect when the input
is X10. This option was new in Netpbm 10.26 (December
2004).</p>

<p>NOTES Two Byte Samples xwdtopnm sometimes produces
output with a maxval greater than 255, which means the
maximum value of a sample (one intensity value, e.g. the red
component of a pixel) is greater than 255 and therefore each
sample takes 2 bytes to represent. This can be a problem
because some programs expect those bytes in a different
order from what the Netpbm format specs say, which is what
xwdtopnm produces, which means they will see totally
different colors that they should. xv is one such
program.</p>

<p>If this is a problem (e.g. you want to look at the
output of xwdtopnm with xv), there are two ways to fix
it:</p>

<p>&middot; Pass the output through pamendian to produce
the format the pro- gram expects.</p>

<p>&middot; Pass the output through pamdepth to reduce the
maxval below 256 so there is only one byte per sample.</p>

<p>Often, there is no good reason to have a maxval greater
than 255. It happens because in XWD, byte not PNM, each
color component of a pixel can have different resolution,
for example 5 bits for blue (maxval 31), 5 bits for red
(maxval 31), and 6 bits for green (maxval 63), for a total
of 16 bits per pixel. In order to reproduce the colors as
closely as possible, xwdtopnm has to use a large maxval. In
this exam- ple, it would use 31 * 63 = 1953, and use 48 bits
per pixel.</p>

<p>Because this is a common and frustrating problem when
using xwdtopnm, the program issues a warning whenever it
generates output with two byte samples. You can quiet this
warning with the -quiet common option . The warning was new
in Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009).</p>
