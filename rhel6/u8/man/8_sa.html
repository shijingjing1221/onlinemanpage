<p>DESCRIPTION sa summarizes information about previously
executed commands as recorded in the acct file. In addition,
it condenses this data into a summary file named savacct
which contains the number of times the command was called
and the system resources used. The information can also be
summarized on a per-user basis; sa will save this
information into a file named usracct.</p>

<p>If no arguments are specified, sa will print information
about all of the commands in the acct file.</p>

<p>If called with a file name as the last argument, sa will
use that file instead of the systems default acct file.</p>

<p>By default, sa will sort the output by sum of user and
system time. If command names have unprintable characters,
or are only called once, sa will sort them into a group
called ***other. If more than one sorting option is
specified, the list will be sorted by the one specified last
on the command line.</p>

<p>The output fields are labeled as follows:</p>

<p>cpu sum of system and user time in cpu seconds</p>

<p>re &quot;real time&quot; in cpu seconds</p>

<p>k cpu-time averaged core usage, in 1k units</p>

<p>k*sec cpu storage integral (kilo-core seconds)</p>

<p>u user cpu time in cpu seconds</p>

<p>s system time in cpu seconds</p>

<p>An asterisk will appear after the name of commands that
forked but didnt call exec.</p>

<p>GNU sa takes care to implement a number of features not
found in other versions. For example, most versions of sa
dont pay attention to flags like --print-seconds and
--sort-num-calls when printing out commands when combined
with the --user-summary or --print-users flags. GNU sa pays
attention to these flags if they are applicable. Also, MIPS
sa stores the average memory use as a short rather than a
double, resulting in some round-off errors. GNU sa uses
double the whole way through.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --list-all-names Force sa not to sort those
command names with unprintable characters and those used
only once into the ***other group. -b,
--sort-sys-user-div-calls Sort the output by the sum of user
and system time divided by the number of calls. -c,
--percentages Print percentages of total time for the
command s user, system, and real time values. -f,
--not-interactive When using the --threshold option, assume
that all answers to interactive queries will be affirmative.
-i, --dont-read-summary-file Dont read the information in
the system s default savacct file. -j, --print-seconds
Instead of printing total minutes for each category, print
seconds per call. -k, --sort-cpu-avmem Sort the output by
cpu time average memory usage. -K, --sort-ksec Print and
sort the output by the cpu-storage integral. -l,
--separate-times Print separate columns for system and user
time; usually the two are added together and listed as cpu.
-m, --user-summary Print the number of processes and number
of CPU minutes on a per-user basis. -n, --sort-num-calls
Sort the output by the number of calls. This is the default
sorting method. -r, --reverse-sort Sort output items in
reverse order. -s, --merge Merge the summarized accounting
data into the summary files savacct and usracct. -t,
--print-ratio For each entry, print the ratio of real time
to the sum of system and user times. If the sum of system
and user times is too small to report--the sum is
zero--*ignore* will appear in this field. -u, --print-users
For each command in the accounting file, print the userid
and command name. After printing all entries, quit. *Note*:
this flag supersedes all others. -v num --threshold num
Print commands which were executed num times or fewer and
await a reply from the terminal. If the response begins with
y, add the command to the **junk** group. --separate-forks
It really doesnt make any sense to me that the stock version
of sa separates statistics for a particular executable
depending on whether or not that command forked. Therefore,
GNU sa lumps this information together unless this option is
specified. --debug Print verbose internal information. -V,
--version Print the version number of sa. -h, --help Prints
the usage string and default locations of system files to
standard output and exits. --sort-real-time Sort the output
by the &quot;real time&quot; field. --other-usracct-file
filename Write summaries by user ID to filename rather than
the systems default usracct file. --other-savacct-file
filename Write summaries by command name to filename rather
than the systems default SAVACCT file. --other-acct-file
filename Read from the file filename instead of the systems
default ACCT file. FILES acct The raw system wide process
accounting file. See acct(5) for further details. savacct A
summary of system process accounting sorted by command.
usracct A summary of system process accounting sorted by
user ID.</p>

<p>BUGS There is not yet a wide experience base for
comparing the output of GNU sa with versions of sa in many
other systems. The problem is that the data files grow big
in a short time and therefore require a lot of disk
space.</p>
