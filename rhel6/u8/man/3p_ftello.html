<p>FTELL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FTELL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ftell, ftello - return a file offset in a
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>long ftell(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>off_t ftello(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ftell() function shall obtain the
current value of the file-posi- tion indicator for the
stream pointed to by stream.</p>

<p>The ftello() function shall be equivalent to ftell(),
except that the return value is of type off_t.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, ftell() and
ftello() shall return the current value of the file-position
indicator for the stream measured in bytes from the
beginning of the file.</p>

<p>Otherwise, ftell() and ftello() shall return -1, cast to
long and off_t respectively, and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The ftell() and ftello() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is not an
open file descriptor.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW For ftell(), the current file offset cannot be
represented cor- rectly in an object of type long.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW For ftello(), the current file offset cannot
be represented cor- rectly in an object of type off_t.</p>

<p>ESPIPE The file descriptor underlying stream is
associated with a pipe or FIFO.</p>

<p>The ftell() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ESPIPE The file descriptor underlying stream is
associated with a socket.</p>
