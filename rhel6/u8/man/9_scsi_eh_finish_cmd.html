SCSI_EH_FINISH_CMD(9)</p>

<p>NAME scsi_eh_finish_cmd - Handle a cmd that eh is
finished with.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void scsi_eh_finish_cmd(struct scsi_cmnd *
scmd, struct list_head * done_q);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS scmd Original SCSI cmd that eh has
finished.</p>

<p>done_q Queue for processed commands.</p>

<p>NOTES We don&acute;t want to use the normal command
completion while we are are still handling errors - it may
cause other commands to be queued, and that would disturb
what we are doing. Thus we really want to keep a list of
pending commands for final completion, and once we are ready
to leave error handling we handle completion for real.</p>
