<p>NAME XmAddToPostFromList a RowColumn function that makes
a menu accessible from more than one widget</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt;</p>

<p>void XmAddToPostFromList( Widget menu, Widget
post_from_widget);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmAddToPostFromList makes a menu accessible
from more than one widget. After a menu is once created,
this function may be used to make that menu accessible from
a second widget. The process may be repeated indefinitely.
In other words, where an application would use XmCre-
atePopupMenu or XmCreatePulldownMenu or their equivalent to
create a new menu identical to one that already exists, it
can use this function to reuse that earlier menu.</p>

<p>If menu refers to a Popup menu, then the
post_from_widget widget can now pop up the specified menu.
The actual posting of the menu occurs as it always does,
either through an event handler, or the automatic popup menu
support (see the XmRowColumn(3) reference page).</p>

<p>If menu refers to a Pulldown menu, its ID is placed in
the XmNsubMenuId resource of the specified post_from_widget.
In this case, the post_from_widget widget must be either a
CascadeButton or a CascadeBut- tonGadget.</p>

<p>Note that this function manipulates the internal
structures themselves, not a copy of them.</p>

<p>menu Specifies the ID of the RowColumn widget containing
the menu (Popup or Pulldown) to be made accessible from the
widget.</p>

<p>post_from_widget Specifies the widget ID of the widget
which will now be able to post the menu specified by
menu.</p>

associated resources, see XmRowColumn(3).</p>
