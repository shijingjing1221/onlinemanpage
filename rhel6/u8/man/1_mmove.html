<p>mmove(1) mmove(1)</p>

<p>Name mmove - move or rename an MSDOS file or
subdirectory</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mmove command is used to moves or
renames an existing MS-DOS file or subdirectory. mmove [-v]
[-D clash_option] sourcefile targetfile mmove [-v] [-D
clash_option] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ]
targetdirectory</p>

<p>Mmove moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file or
subdirectory. Unlike the MS-DOS version of MOVE, mmove is
able to move subdirectories. Files or directories can only
be moved within one filesystem. Data can- not be moved from
Dos to Unix or vice-versa. If you omit the drive letter from
the target file or directory, the same letter as for the
source is assumed. If you omit the drive letter from all
parameters, drive a: is assumed by default.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
