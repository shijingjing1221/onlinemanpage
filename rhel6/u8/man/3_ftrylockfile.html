<p>FLOCKFILE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FLOCKFILE(3)</p>

<p>NAME flockfile, ftrylockfile, funlockfile - lock FILE
for stdio</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>void flockfile(FILE *filehandle); int ftrylockfile(FILE
*filehandle); void funlockfile(FILE *filehandle);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>All functions shown above: _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 1 ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE || _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE ||
_POSIX_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The stdio functions are thread-safe. This is
achieved by assigning to each FILE object a lockcount and
(if the lockcount is non-zero) an own- ing thread. For each
library call, these functions wait until the FILE object is
no longer locked by a different thread, then lock it, do the
requested I/O, and unlock the object again.</p>

<p>(Note: this locking has nothing to do with the file
locking done by functions like flock(2) and lockf(3).)</p>

<p>All this is invisible to the C-programmer, but there may
be two reasons to wish for more detailed control. On the one
hand, maybe a series of I/O actions by one thread belongs
together, and should not be inter- rupted by the I/O of some
other thread. On the other hand, maybe the locking overhead
should be avoided for greater efficiency.</p>

<p>To this end, a thread can explicitly lock the FILE
object, then do its series of I/O actions, then unlock. This
prevents other threads from coming in between. If the reason
for doing this was to achieve greater efficiency, one does
the I/O with the non-locking versions of the stdio
functions: with getc_unlocked(3) and putc_unlocked(3)
instead of getc(3) and putc(3).</p>

<p>The flockfile() function waits for *filehandle to be no
longer locked by a different thread, then makes the current
thread owner of *filehan- dle, and increments the
lockcount.</p>

<p>The funlockfile() function decrements the lock
count.</p>

<p>The ftrylockfile() function is a non-blocking version of
flockfile(). It does nothing in case some other thread owns
*filehandle, and it obtains ownership and increments the
lockcount otherwise.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The ftrylockfile() function returns zero
for success (the lock was obtained), and non-zero for
failure.</p>

<p>ERRORS None.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY These functions are available when
_POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS is defined. They are in libc
since libc 5.1.1 and in glibc since glibc 2.0.</p>
