<p>NAME XmClipboardLock A clipboard function that locks the
clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardLock (display, window) Display * display; Window
window; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardLock locks the clipboard from
access by another application until XmClipboardUnlock is
called. All clipboard functions lock and unlock the
clipboard to prevent simultaneous access. This function
allows the application to keep the clipboard data from
changing between calls to Inquire and other clipboard
functions. The application does not need to lock the
clipboard between calls to XmClipboardStartCopy and
XmClipboardEndCopy or to XmClipboardStartRetrieve and
XmClipboard- EndRetrieve.</p>

<p>If the clipboard is already locked by another
application, XmClipboard- Lock returns an error status.
Multiple calls to this function by the same application
increase the lock level.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>
