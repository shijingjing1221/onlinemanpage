<p>FOLD(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FOLD(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fold - filter for folding lines</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fold [-bs][-w width][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fold utility is a filter that shall fold
lines from its input files, breaking the lines to have a
maximum of width column positions (or bytes, if the -b
option is specified). Lines shall be broken by the insertion
of a &lt;newline&gt; such that each output line (referred to
later in this section as a segment) is the maximum width
possible that does not exceed the specified number of column
positions (or bytes). A line shall not be broken in the
middle of a character. The behavior is undefined if width is
less than the number of columns any single char- acter in
the input would occupy.</p>

<p>If the &lt;carriage-return&gt;s, &lt;backspace&gt;s, or
&lt;tab&gt;s are encountered in the input, and the -b option
is not specified, they shall be treated specially:</p>

<p>&lt;backspace&gt; The current count of line width shall
be decremented by one, although the count never shall become
negative. The fold utility shall not insert a
&lt;newline&gt; immediately before or after any
&lt;backspace&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;carriage-return&gt;</p>

<p>The current count of line width shall be set to zero.
The fold utility shall not insert a &lt;newline&gt;
immediately before or after any &lt;carriage-return&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;tab&gt; Each &lt;tab&gt; encountered shall advance
the column position pointer to the next tab stop. Tab stops
shall be at each column position n such that n modulo 8
equals 1.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The fold utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-b Count width in bytes rather than column
positions.</p>

<p>-s If a segment of a line contains a &lt;blank&gt;
within the first width column positions (or bytes), break
the line after the last such &lt;blank&gt; meeting the width
constraints. If there is no &lt;blank&gt; meeting the
requirements, the -s option shall have no effect for that
output segment of the input line.</p>

<p>-w width Specify the maximum line length, in column
positions (or bytes if -b is specified). The results are
unspecified if width is not a positive decimal number. The
default value shall be 80.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a text file to be folded. If no file
operands are specified, the standard input shall be
used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES If the -b option is specified, the input
files shall be text files except that the lines are not
limited to {LINE_MAX} bytes in length. If the -b option is
not specified, the input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of fold:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files), and for the determination of the width in
column positions each character would occupy on a
constant-width font output device.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be a file containing a
sequence of characters whose order shall be preserved from
the input files, possibly with inserted
&lt;newline&gt;s.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were processed successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The cut and fold utilities can be used
to create text files out of files with arbitrary line
lengths. The cut utility should be used when the number of
lines (or records) needs to remain constant. The fold
utility should be used when the contents of long lines need
to be kept contiguous.</p>

<p>The fold utility is frequently used to send text files
to printers that truncate, rather than fold, lines wider
than the printer is able to print (usually 80 or 132 column
positions).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES An example invocation that submits a file of
possibly long lines to the printer (under the assumption
that the user knows the line width of the printer to be
assigned by lp):</p>

<p>fold -w 132 bigfile | lp</p>

<p>RATIONALE Although terminal input in canonical
processing mode requires the erase character (frequently set
to &lt;backspace&gt;) to erase the previous charac- ter (not
byte or column position), terminal output is not buffered
and is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to parse
correctly; the interpretation depends entirely on the
physical device that actually displays/prints/stores the
output. In all known internationalized implementations, the
utilities producing output for mixed column-width output
assume that a &lt;backspace&gt; backs up one column position
and out- puts enough &lt;backspace&gt;s to return to the
start of the character when &lt;backspace&gt; is used to
provide local line motions to support underlin- ing and
emboldening operations. Since fold without the -b option is
dealing with these same constraints, &lt;backspace&gt; is
always treated as backing up one column position rather than
backing up one character.</p>

<p>Historical versions of the fold utility assumed 1 byte
was one charac- ter and occupied one column position when
written out. This is no longer always true. Since the most
common usage of fold is believed to be folding long lines
for output to limited-length output devices, this capability
was preserved as the default case. The -b option was added
so that applications could fold files with arbitrary length
lines into text files that could then be processed by the
standard utilities. Note that although the width for the -b
option is in bytes, a line is never split in the middle of a
character. (It is unspecified what happens if a width is
specified that is too small to hold a single character found
in the input followed by a &lt;newline&gt;.)</p>

<p>The tab stops are hardcoded to be every eighth column to
meet histori- cal practice. No new method of specifying
other tab stops was invented.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
