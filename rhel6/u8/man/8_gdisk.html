<p>GDISK(8) GPT fdisk Manual GDISK(8)</p>

<p>NAME gdisk - Interactive GUID partition table (GPT)
manipulator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gdisk [ -l ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GPT fdisk (aka gdisk) is a text-mode
menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of
partition tables. It will automatically convert an old-style
Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel
stored without an MBR carrier partition to the newer
Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT)
format, or will load a GUID partition table. When used with
the -l command-line option, the program displays the current
partition table and then exits.</p>

<p>GPT fdisk operates mainly on the GPT headers and
partition tables; how- ever, it can and will generate a
fresh protective MBR, when required. (Any boot loader code
in the protective MBR will not be disturbed.) If youve
created an unusual protective MBR, such as a hybrid MBR
created by gptsync or gdisk s own hybrid MBR creation
feature, this should not be disturbed by most ordinary
actions. Some advanced data recovery options require you to
understand the distinctions between the main and backup
data, as well as between the GPT headers and the partition
tables. For information on MBR vs. GPT, as well as GPT
terminology and structure, see the extended gdisk
documentation at http://www.rods- books.com/gdisk/ or
consult Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The gdisk program employs a user interface similar to
that of Linuxs fdisk, but gdisk modifies GPT partitions. It
also has the capability of transforming MBR partitions or
BSD disklabels into GPT partitions. Like the original fdisk
program, gdisk does not modify disk structures until you
explicitly write them to disk, so if you make a mistake, you
can exit from the program with the q option to leave your
partitions unmodified.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, gdisk operates on disk device files, such as
/dev/sda or /dev/hda under Linux, /dev/disk0 under Mac OS X,
or /dev/ad0 or /dev/da0 under FreeBSD. The program can also
operate on disk image files, which can be either copies of
whole disks (made with dd, for instance) or raw disk images
used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that only raw
disk images are supported; gdisk cannot work on com- pressed
or other advanced disk image formats.</p>

<p>The MBR partitioning system uses a combination of
cylinder/head/sector (CHS) addressing and logical block
addressing (LBA). The former is klunky and limiting. GPT
drops CHS addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode exclusively.
Thus, GPT data structures, and therefore gdisk, do not need
to deal with CHS geometries and all the problems they
create. Users of fdisk will note that gdisk lacks the
options and limitations associated with CHS geometries.</p>

<p>For best results, you should use an OS-specific
partition table program whenever possible. For example, you
should make Mac OS X partitions with the Mac OS X Disk
Utility program and Linux partitions with the Linux gdisk or
GNU Parted program.</p>

<p>Upon start, gdisk attempts to identify the partition
type in use on the disk. If it finds valid GPT data, gdisk
will use it. If gdisk finds a valid MBR or BSD disklabel but
no GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR or disklabel
into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have unusable
first and/or final partitions because they overlap with the
GPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can identify, but
not use data in, Apple Partition Map (APM) disks, which are
used on 680x0- and Pow- erPC-based Macintoshes. Upon exiting
with the w option, gdisk replaces the MBR or disklabel with
a GPT. This action is potentially dangerous! Your system may
become unbootable, and partition type codes may become
corrupted if the disk uses unrecognized type codes. Boot
problems are particularly likely if you re multi-booting
with any GPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly launch gdisk on
an MBR disk, you can safely exit the program without making
any changes by using the q option.</p>

<p>The MBR-to-GPT conversion will leave at least one gap in
the partition numbering if the original MBR used logical
partitions. These gaps are harmless, but you can eliminate
them by using the s option, if you like. (Doing this may
require you to update your /etc/fstab file.)</p>

<p>When creating a fresh partition table, certain
considerations may be in order:</p>

<p>* For data (non-boot) disks, and for boot disks used on
BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the boot loader,
partitions may be cre- ated in whatever order and in
whatever sizes are desired.</p>

<p>* Boot disks for EFI-based systems require an EFI System
Partition (gdisk internal code 0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32.
The recom- mended size of this partition is between 100 and
300 MiB. Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that GNU
Parted iden- tifies such partitions as having the &quot;boot
flag&quot; set.)</p>

<p>* Some boot loaders for BIOS-based systems make use of a
BIOS Boot Partition (gdisk internal code 0xEF02), in which
the secondary boot loader is stored, possibly without the
benefit of a filesystem. (GRUB2 may optionally use such a
partition.) This partition can typically be quite small
(roughly 32 to 200 KiB), but you should consult your boot
loader documentation for details.</p>

<p>* If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of
type Microsoft Reserved (gdisk internal code 0x0C01) is
recommended. This partition should be about 128 MiB in size.
It ordinarily follows the EFI System Partition and
immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that
old versions of GNU Parted create all FAT partitions as this
type, which actually makes the partition unusable for normal
file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)</p>

<p>* Some OSes GPT utilities create some blank space
(typically 128 MiB) after each partition. The intent is to
enable future disk utilities to use this space. Such free
space is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help
in future disk maintenance. You can use GPT fdisk s relative
partition positioning option (specifying the starting sector
as +128M, for instance) to simplify creating such gaps.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l List the partition table for the specified
device and then exits.</p>

<p>Most interactions with gdisk occur with its interactive
text-mode menus. Three menus exist: the main menu, the
recovery &amp; transformation menu, and the experts menu.
The main menu provides the functions that are most likely to
be useful for typical partitioning tasks, such as creating
and deleting partitions, changing partition type codes, and
so on. Specific functions are:</p>

<p>b Save partition data to a backup file. You can back up
your cur- rent in-memory partition table to a disk file
using this option. The resulting file is a binary file
consisting of the protective MBR, the main GPT header, the
backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition table, in
that order. Note that the backup is of the current in-memory
data structures, so if you launch the pro- gram, make
changes, and then use this option, the backup will reflect
your changes. Note also that the restore option is on the
recovery &amp; transformation menu; the backup option is on
the main menu to encourage its use.</p>

<p>c Change the GPT name of a partition. This name is
encoded as a UTF-16 string, but proper entry and display of
anything beyond basic ASCII values requires suitable locale
and font support. For the most part, Linux ignores the
partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. GPT
fdisk sets a default name based on the partition type code.
Note that the GPT partition name is different from the
filesystem name, which is encoded in the filesystems data
structures.</p>

<p>d Delete a partition. This action deletes the entry from
the par- tition table but does not disturb the data within
the sectors originally allocated to the partition on the
disk. If a corre- sponding hybrid MBR partition exists,
gdisk deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent 0xEE
(EFI GPT) MBR protective partition to fill the new free
space.</p>

<p>i Show detailed partition information. The summary
information produced by the p command necessarily omits many
details, such as the partitions unique GUID and the
translation of gdisks internal partition type code to a
plain type name. The i option displays this information for
a single partition.</p>

<p>l Display a summary of partition types. GPT uses a GUID
to iden- tify partition types for particular OSes and
purposes. For ease of data entry, gdisk compresses these
into two-byte (four-digit hexadecimal) values that are
related to their equivalent MBR codes. Specifically, the MBR
code is multiplied by hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the
code for Linux swap space in MBR is 0x82, and it s 0x8200 in
gdisk. A one-to-one correspondence is impossible, though.
Most notably, the codes for all varieties of FAT and NTFS
partition correspond to a single GPT code (entered as 0x0700
in sgdisk). Some OSes use a single MBR code but employ many
more codes in GPT. For these, gdisk adds code numbers
sequentially, such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD disklabel, 0xa501
for FreeBSD boot, 0xa502 for FreeBSD swap, and so on. Note
that these two-byte codes are unique to gdisk.</p>

<p>n Create a new partition. This command is modelled after
the equivalent fdisk option, although some differences
exist. You enter a partition number, starting sector, and an
ending sector. Both start and end sectors can be specified
in absolute terms as sector numbers or as positions measured
in kibibytes (K), mebibytes (M), gibibytes (G), tebibytes
(T), or pebibytes (P); for instance, 40M specifies a
position 40MiB from the start of the disk. You can specify
locations relative to the start or end of the specified
default range by preceding the number by a + or - symbol, as
in +2G to specify a point 2GiB after the default start
sector, or -200M to specify a point 200MiB before the last
available sector. Pressing the Enter key with no input
specifies the default value, which is the start of the
largest available block for the start sector and the end of
the same block for the end sector.</p>

<p>o Clear out all partition data. This includes GPT header
data, all partition definitions, and the protective MBR. The
sector align- ment is reset to the default (2048 sectors, or
1MB).</p>

<p>p Display basic partition summary data. This includes
partition numbers, starting and ending sector numbers,
partition sizes, gdisks partition types codes, and partition
names. For addi- tional information, use the i command.</p>

<p>q Quit from the program without saving your changes. Use
this option if you just wanted to view information or if you
make a mistake and want to back out of all your changes.</p>

<p>r Enter the recovery &amp; transformation menu. This
menu includes emergency recovery options (to fix damaged GPT
data structures) and options to transform to or from other
partitioning systems, including creating hybrid MBRs.</p>

<p>s Sort partition entries. GPT partition numbers need not
match the order of partitions on the disk. If you want them
to match, you can use this option. Note that some
partitioning utilities sort partitions whenever they make
changes. Such changes will be reflected in your device
filenames, so you may need to edit /etc/fstab if you use
this option.</p>

<p>t Change a single partitions type code. You enter the
type code using a two-byte hexadecimal number, as described
earlier. You may also enter a GUID directly, if you have one
and gdisk doesnt know it.</p>

<p>v Verify disk. This option checks for a variety of
problems, such as incorrect CRCs and mismatched main and
backup data. This option does not automatically correct most
problems, though; for that, you must use options on the
recovery &amp; transformation menu. If no problems are
found, this command displays a summary of unallocated disk
space.</p>

<p>w Write data. Use this command to save your changes.</p>

<p>x Enter the experts menu. Using this option provides
access to features you can use to get into even more trouble
than the main menu allows.</p>

<p>? Print the menu. Type this command (or any other
unrecognized command) to see a summary of available
options.</p>

<p>The second gdisk menu is the recovery &amp;
transformation menu, which pro- vides access to data
recovery options and features related to the transformation
of partitions between partitioning schemes (converting BSD
disklabels into GPT partitions or creating hybrid MBRs, for
instance). A few options on this menu duplicate
functionality on the main menu, for the sake of convenience.
The options on this menu are:</p>

<p>b Rebuild GPT header from backup. You can use the backup
GPT header to rebuild the main GPT header with this option.
Its likely to be useful if your main GPT header was damaged
or destroyed (say, by sloppy use of dd).</p>

<p>c Load backup partition table. Ordinarily, gdisk uses
only the main partition table (although the backup s
integrity is checked when you launch the program). If the
main partition table has been damaged, you can use this
option to load the backup from disk and use it instead. Note
that this will almost certainly produce no or strange
partition entries if youve just converted an MBR disk to GPT
format, since there will be no backup parti- tion table on
disk.</p>

<p>d Use main GPT header and rebuild the backup. This
option is likely to be useful if the backup GPT header has
been damaged or destroyed.</p>

<p>e Load main partition table. This option reloads the
main parti- tion table from disk. It s only likely to be
useful if youve tried to use the backup partition table (via
c) but its in worse shape then the main partition table.</p>

<p>f Load MBR and build fresh GPT from it. Use this option
if your GPT is corrupt or conflicts with the MBR and you
want to use the MBR as the basis for a new set of GPT
partitions.</p>

<p>g Convert GPT into MBR and exit. This option converts as
many par- titions as possible into MBR form, destroys the
GPT data struc- tures, saves the new MBR, and exits. Use
this option if youve tried GPT and find that MBR works
better for you. Note that this function generates up to four
primary MBR partitions or three primary partitions and as
many logical partitions as can be generated. Each logical
partition requires at least one unal- located block
immediately before its first block. Therefore, it may be
possible to convert a maximum of four partitions on disks
with tightly-packed partitions; however, if free space was
inserted between partitions when they were created, and if
the disk is under 2 TiB in size, it should be possible to
convert all the partitions to MBR form. See also the h
option.</p>

<p>h Create a hybrid MBR. This is an ugly workaround that
enables GPT-unaware OSes, or those that cant boot from a GPT
disk, to access up to three of the partitions on the disk by
creating MBR entries for them. Note that these hybrid MBR
entries can easily go out of sync with the GPT entries,
particularly when hybrid-unaware GPT utilities are used to
edit the disk. Thus, you may need to re-create the hybrid
MBR if you use such tools. Unlike the g option, this option
does not support converting any partitions into MBR logical
partitions.</p>

<p>i Show detailed partition information. This option is
identical to the i option on the main menu.</p>

<p>l Load partition data from a backup file. This option is
the reverse of the b option on the main menu. Note that
restoring partition data from anything but the original disk
is not recom- mended.</p>

<p>m Return to the main menu. This option enables you to
enter main-menu commands.</p>

<p>o Print protective MBR data. You can see a summary of
the protec- tive MBR s partitions with this option. This may
enable you to spot glaring problems or help identify the
partitions in a hybrid MBR.</p>

<p>p Print the partition table. This option is identical to
the p option in the main menu.</p>

<p>q Quit without saving changes. This option is identical
to the q option in the main menu.</p>

<p>t Transform BSD partitions into GPT partitions. This
option works on BSD disklabels held within GPT (or converted
MBR) partitions. Converted partitions type codes are likely
to need manual adjustment. gdisk will attempt to convert BSD
disklabels stored on the main disk when launched, but this
conversion is likely to produce first and/or last partitions
that are unusable. The many BSD variants means that the
probability of gdisk being unable to convert a BSD disklabel
is high compared to the likelihood of problems with an MBR
conversion.</p>

<p>v Verify disk. This option is identical to the v option
in the main menu.</p>

<p>w Write table to disk and exit. This option is identical
to the w option in the main menu.</p>

<p>x Enter the experts menu. This option is identical to
the x option in the main menu.</p>

<p>? Print the menu. This option (or any unrecognized
entry) displays a summary of the menu options.</p>

<p>The third gdisk menu is the experts menu. This menu
provides advanced options that arent closely related to
recovery or transformation between partitioning systems. Its
options are:</p>

<p>a Set attributes. GPT provides a 64-bit attributes field
that can be used to set features for each partition. gdisk
supports four attributes: system partition, read-only,
hidden, and do not automount. You can set other attributes,
but their numbers aren t translated into anything useful. In
practice, most OSes seem to ignore these attributes.</p>

<p>c Change partition GUID. You can enter a custom unique
GUID for a partition using this option. (Note this refers to
the GUID that uniquely identifies a partition, not to its
type code, which you can change with the t main-menu
option.) Ordinarily, gdisk assigns this number randomly;
however, you might want to adjust the number manually if
youve wound up with the same GUID on two partitions because
of buggy GUID assignments (hopefully not in gdisk) or sheer
incredible coincidence.</p>

<p>d Display the sector alignment value. See the
description of the l option for more details.</p>

<p>e Move backup GPT data structures to the end of the
disk. Use this command if you ve added disks to a RAID
array, thus creating a virtual disk with space that follows
the backup GPT data struc- tures. This command moves the
backup GPT data structures to the end of the disk, where
they belong.</p>

<p>f Randomize the disks GUID and all partitions unique
GUIDs (but not their partition type code GUIDs). This
function may be used after cloning a disk with another
utility in order to render all GUIDs once again unique.</p>

<p>g Change disk GUID. Each disk has a unique GUID code,
which gdisk assigns randomly upon creation of the GPT data
structures. You can generate a fresh random GUID or enter
one manually with this option.</p>

<p>h Recompute CHS values in protective or hybrid MBR. This
option can sometimes help if a disk utility, OS, or BIOS
doesnt like the CHS values used by the partitions in the
protective or hybrid MBR. In particular, the GPT
specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for over-8GiB
partitions, but this value is technically illegal by the
usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they encounter this
value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS value --
0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, enabling these BIOSes to
boot.</p>

<p>i Show detailed partition information. This option is
identical to the i option on the main menu.</p>

<p>l Change the sector alignment value. Disks with more
logical sec- tors per physical sectors (such as modern
Advanced Format drives), some RAID configurations, and many
SSD devices, can suffer performance problems if partitions
are not aligned prop- erly for their internal data
structures. On new disks, GPT fdisk attempts to align
partitions on 2048-sector (1MiB) boundaries by default,
which optimizes performance for all of these disk types. On
pre-partitioned disks, GPT fdisk attempts to identify the
alignment value used on that disk, but will set 8-sector
alignment on disks larger than 300 GB even if lesser
alignment values are detected. In either case, it can be
changed by using this option.</p>

<p>m Return to the main menu. This option enables you to
enter main-menu commands.</p>

<p>n Create a new protective MBR. Use this option if the
current pro- tective MBR is damaged in a way that gdisk
doesn t automatically detect and correct, or if you want to
convert a hybrid MBR into a &quot;pure&quot; GPT with a
conventional protective MBR.</p>

<p>o Print protective MBR data. You can see a summary of
the protec- tive MBR s partitions with this option. This may
enable you to spot glaring problems or help identify the
partitions in a hybrid MBR.</p>

<p>p Print the partition table. This option is identical to
the p option in the main menu.</p>

<p>q Quit without saving changes. This option is identical
to the q option in the main menu.</p>

<p>r Enter the recovery &amp; transformations menu. This
option is iden- tical to the r option on the main menu.</p>

<p>s Resize partition table. The default partition table
size is 128 entries. Officially, sizes of less than 16KB
(128 entries, given the normal entry size) are unsupported
by the GPT specifi- cation; however, in practice they seem
to work, and can some- times be useful in converting MBR
disks. Larger sizes also work fine. OSes may impose their
own limits on the number of parti- tions, though.</p>

<p>t Swap two partitions entries in the partition table.
One parti- tion may be empty. For instance, if partitions
1-4 are defined, transposing 1 and 5 results in a table with
partitions numbered from 2-5. Transposing partitions in this
way has no effect on their disk space allocation; it only
alters their order in the partition table.</p>

<p>u Replicate the current devices partition table on
another device. You will be prompted to type the new device
s filename. After the write operation completes, you can
continue editing the original devices partition table. Note
that the replicated partition table is an exact copy,
including all GUIDs; if the device should have its own
unique GUIDs, you should use the f option on the new
disk.</p>

<p>v Verify disk. This option is identical to the v option
in the main menu.</p>

<p>z Zap (destroy) the GPT data structures and exit. Use
this option if you want to repartition a GPT disk using
fdisk or some other GPT-unaware program. Youll be given the
choice of preserving the existing MBR, in case its a hybrid
MBR with salvageable partitions or if you ve already created
new MBR partitions and want to erase the remnants of your
GPT partitions. If youve already created new MBR partitions,
its conceivable that this option will damage the first
and/or last MBR partitions! Such an event is unlikely, but
could occur if your new MBR partitions overlap the old GPT
data structures.</p>

<p>? Print the menu. This option (or any unrecognized
entry) displays a summary of the menu options.</p>

<p>In many cases, you can press the Enter key to select a
default option when entering data. When only one option is
possible, gdisk usually bypasses the prompt entirely.</p>

<p>BUGS As of March 2014 (version 0.8.10), gdisk should be
considered beta software. Known bugs and limitations
include:</p>

<p>* The program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD,
Mac OS X, and Windows. Linux versions for x86-64 (64-bit),
x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have been tested, with
the x86-64 version having seen the most testing. Under
FreeBSD, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions have been
tested. Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X and Windows have
been tested by the author, although I ve heard of 64-bit
versions being successfully com- piled.</p>

<p>* The FreeBSD version of the program can t write changes
to the partition table to a disk when existing partitions on
that disk are mounted. (The same problem exists with many
other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.) This
limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p>* The fields used to display the start and end sector
numbers for partitions in the p command are 14 characters
wide. This translates to a limitation of about 45 PiB. On
larger disks, the displayed columns will go out of
alignment.</p>

<p>* In the Windows version, only ASCII characters are
supported in the partition name field. If an existing
partition uses non-ASCII UTF-16 characters, theyre likely to
be corrupted in the i and p menu options displays; however,
they should be preserved when loading and saving partitions.
Binaries for Linux, FreeBSD, and OS X support full UTF-16
partition names.</p>

<p>* The program can load only up to 128 partitions (4
primary parti- tions and 124 logical partitions) when
converting from MBR for- mat. This limit can be raised by
changing the #define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in the basicmbr.h
source code file and recom- piling; however, such a change
will require using a larger-than-normal partition table.
(The limit of 128 partitions was chosen because that number
equals the 128 partitions sup- ported by the most common
partition table size.)</p>

<p>* Converting from MBR format sometimes fails because of
insuffi- cient space at the start or (more commonly) the end
of the disk. Resizing the partition table (using the s
option in the experts menu) can sometimes overcome this
problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary to
resize a partition using GNU Parted or a similar tool prior
to conversion with gdisk.</p>

<p>* MBR conversions work only if the disk has correct LBA
partition descriptors. These descriptors should be present
on any disk over 8 GiB in size or on smaller disks
partitioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p>* BSD disklabel support can create first and/or last
partitions that overlap with the GPT data structures. This
can sometimes be compensated by adjusting the partition
table size, but in extreme cases the affected partition(s)
may need to be deleted.</p>

<p>* Because of the highly variable nature of BSD disklabel
struc- tures, conversions from this form may be unreliable
-- parti- tions may be dropped, converted in a way that
creates overlaps with other partitions, or converted with
incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with
caution!</p>

<p>* Booting after converting an MBR or BSD disklabel disk
is likely to be disrupted. Sometimes re-installing a boot
loader will fix the problem, but other times you may need to
switch boot load- ers. Except on EFI-based platforms,
Windows through at least Windows 7 doesnt support booting
from GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the h option on
the recovery &amp; transforma- tion menu) or abandoning GPT
in favor of MBR may be your only options in this case.</p>
