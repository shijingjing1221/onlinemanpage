<p>NAME slapd-monitor - Monitor backend to slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The monitor backend to slapd(8) is not an
actual database; if enabled, it is automatically generated
and dynamically maintained by slapd with information about
the running status of the daemon.</p>

<p>To inspect all monitor information, issue a subtree
search with base cn=Monitor, requesting that attributes
&quot;+&quot; and &quot;*&quot; are returned. The monitor
backend produces mostly operational attributes, and LDAP
only returns operational attributes that are explicitly
requested. Request- ing attribute &quot;+&quot; is an
extension which requests all operational attributes.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the
monitor backend database. That is, they must follow a
&quot;database monitor&quot; line and come before any sub-
sequent &quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot;
lines.</p>

<p>As opposed to most databases, the monitor database can
be instantiated only once, i.e. only one occurrence of
&quot;database monitor&quot; can occur in the slapd.conf(5)
file. Moreover, the suffix of the database cannot be
explicitly set by means of the suffix directive. The suffix
is auto- matically set to &quot;cn=Monitor&quot;.</p>

<p>The monitor database honors the rootdn and the rootpw
directives, and the usual ACL directives, e.g. the access
directive.</p>

<p>Other database options are described in the
slapd.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>USAGE The usage is:</p>

<p>1) enable the monitor backend at configure:</p>

<p>configure --enable-monitor</p>

<p>2) activate the monitor database in the slapd.conf(5)
file:</p>

<p>database monitor</p>

<p>3) add ACLs as detailed in slapd.access(5) to control
access to the database, e.g.:</p>

<p>access to dn.subtree=&quot;cn=Monitor&quot; by
dn.exact=&quot;uid=Admin,dc=my,dc=org&quot; write by users
read by * none</p>

<p>4) ensure that the core.schema file is loaded. The
monitor backend relies on some standard track attributeTypes
that must be already defined when the backend is
started.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL The monitor backend honors access control
semantics as indicated in slapd.access(5), including the
disclose access privilege, on all cur- rently implemented
operations.</p>

<p>KNOWN LIMITATIONS The monitor backend does not honor
size/time limits in search opera- tions.</p>
