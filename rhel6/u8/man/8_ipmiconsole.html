<p>NAME ipmiconsole - IPMI console utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipmiconsole [OPTION...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipmiconsole is a Serial-over-LAN (SOL)
console utility. It can be used to establish console
sessions to remote machines using the IPMI 2.0 SOL
protocol.</p>

<p>Ipmiconsole communicates with a remote machine s
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) to establish a console
session. Before any SOL commu- nication can take place, the
remote machines BMC must be configured properly. The
FreeIPMI tool bmc-config(8) may be used to do this con-
figuration.</p>

<p>Often (although not always), console redirection must be
also be con- figured properly in the BIOS and/or operating
system. Both must be con- figured to redirect console
traffic out the appropriate COM port. Please see your
motherboard and OS documentation for instructions on proper
setup.</p>

<p>Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific
options, trouble shooting information, workaround
information, examples, and known issues. For a general
introduction to FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7).</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS The following options are general
options for configuring IPMI communi- cation and executing
general tool commands.</p>

<p>-h IPMIHOST, --hostname=IPMIHOST[:PORT] Specify the
remote host to communicate with. An optional port can be
specified, which may be useful in port forwarding or sim-
ilar situations.</p>

<p>-u, --username=USERNAME Specify the username to use when
authenticating with the remote host. If not specified, a
null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The user must a
high enough privilege to establish a SOL session and have
SOL session abilities.</p>

<p>-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD Specify the password to
use when authenticationg with the remote host. If not
specified, a null password is assumed. Maximum password
length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p>-P, --password-prompt Prompt for password to avoid
possibility of listing it in pro- cess lists.</p>

<p>-k K_G, --k-g=K_G Specify the K_g BMC key to use when
authenticating with the remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not
specified, a null key is assumed. To input the key in
hexadecimal form, prefix the string with 0x. E.g., the key
abc can be entered with the either the string abc or the
string 0x616263</p>

<p>-K, --k-g-prompt Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of
listing it in process lists.</p>

<p>--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the session
timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000 milliseconds (60
seconds) if not specified.</p>

<p>--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the packet
retransmission timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 500
milliseconds (0.5 seconds) if not specified.</p>

<p>-I, --cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID Specify the IPMI
2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher Suite ID identifies a
set of authentication, integrity, and confidential- ity
algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0 communication. The authenti-
cation algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for session
setup, the integrity algorithm identifies the algorithm to
use for session packet signatures, and the confidentiality
algorithm identifies the algorithm to use for payload
encryption. Defaults to cipher suite ID 3 if not specified.
The user should be aware that only cipher suite ids 3, 8,
and 12 encrypt console pay- loads. Console information will
be sent in the clear if an alternate cipher suite id is
selected. The following cipher suite ids are currently
supported:</p>

<p>0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm
= None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>3 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>7 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>8 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>16 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>17 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>-l PRIVILEGE-LEVEL, --privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL
Specify the privilege level to be used. The currently
available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to ADMIN if not specified.</p>

<p>--config-file=FILE Specify an alternate configuration
file.</p>

<p>-W WORKAROUNDS, --workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS Specify
workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
com- mand line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
workarounds (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p>--debug Turn on debugging.</p>

<p>-?, --help Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p>--usage Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p>IPMICONSOLE OPTIONS The following options are specific
to Ipmiconsole.</p>

<p>-e CHAR, --escape-char=CHAR Specify an alternate escape
character (default char &amp;).</p>

<p>-N, --dont-steal Do not steal an SOL session if one is
already detected as being in use. Under most circumstances,
if SOL is detected as being in use, ipmiconsole will attempt
to steal the SOL session away from the previous session.
This default behavior exists for several reasons, most
notably that earlier SOL sessions may have not been able to
be deactivate properly.</p>

<p>-T, --deactivate Deactivate a SOL session if one is
detected as being in use and exit.</p>

<p>--serial-keepalive Occasionally send NUL characters to
detect inactive serial con- nections. This option is
particularly useful for those who intend to run ipmiconsole
without much interaction, such as for logging purposes.
While IPMI connections may still be alive, some motherboards
have exhibited bugs in which underlying serial data can no
longer be sent/received. From the viewpoint of ipmi-
console, data is simply not be sent out of the remote system
and this problem is only detected once there is user
interaction. By sending the occasional NUL character, the
underlying loss of serial data transfer can be detected far
more quickly. There is some risk with this option, as the
NUL character byte may affect the remote system depending on
what data it may or may not be expecting.</p>

<p>--serial-keepalive-empty This option is identical to
--serial-keepalive except that SOL packets will contain no
NUL character data. On some mother- boards, this may be
sufficient to deal with a hanging IPMI ses- sion without the
risk regularly sending a NUL character byte may have.
However, some systems may not ACK a SOL packet without
character data in it, meaning these keepalive packets do
noth- ing.</p>

<p>-L, --lock-memory Lock sensitive information (such as
usernames and passwords) in memory.</p>

<p>ESCAPE CHARACTERS The following escape sequences are
supported. The default supported escape character is &amp; ,
but can be changed with the -e option.</p>

<p>&amp;? Display a list of currently available escape
sequences.</p>

<p>&amp;. Terminate the connection.</p>

<p>&amp;B Send a &quot;serial-break&quot; to the remote
console.</p>

<p>&amp;D Send a DEL character.</p>

<p>&amp;&amp; Send a single escape character.</p>

<p>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING Most often, IPMI problems are
due to configuration problems.</p>

<p>IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the
remote machines BMC. Double check to make sure the following
are configured properly in the remote machines BMC: IP
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privi- lege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration settings.</p>

<p>In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please
see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any vendor
specific bugs that have been dis- covered and worked
around.</p>

<p>Listed below are many of the common issues for error
messages. For additional support, please e-mail the
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing list.</p>

<p>&quot;username invalid&quot; - The username entered (or
a NULL username if none was entered) is not available on the
remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC s
username configuration is incorrect.</p>

<p>&quot;password invalid&quot; - The password entered (or
a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
also be possible the password for the user is not correctly
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;password verification timeout&quot; - Password
verification has timed out. A &quot;password invalid&quot;
error (described above) or a generic &quot;session
timeout&quot; (described below) occurred. During this point
in the protocol it cannot be differentiated which
occurred.</p>

<p>&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL
K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It may also be
possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI
command requires a higher user privilege than the one
authenticated with. Please try to authenticate with a higher
privilege. This may require authenticating to a different
user which has a higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level cannot be obtained for this
user&quot; - The privilege level you are attempting to
authenticate with is higher than the maxi- mum allowed for
this user. Please try again with a lower privilege. It may
also be possible the maximum privilege level allowed for a
user is not configured properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted
privilege level&quot; - The authentication type you wish to
authenticate with is not available for this privilege level.
Please try again with an alternate authentication type or
alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the
available authentication types you can authenticate with are
not cor- rectly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;cipher suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher
suite id you wish to authen- ticate with is not available on
the remote BMC. Please try again with an alternate cipher
suite id. It may also be possible the available cipher suite
ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not
discovered on the remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5
instead.</p>

<p>&quot;connection timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI
communication failed. A number of potential errors are
possible, including an invalid hostname specified, an IPMI
IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the
remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please
verify con- figuration and connectivity.</p>

<p>&quot;session timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed
out. Please reconnect. If this error occurs often, you may
wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote
BMCs are considerably slower than others.</p>

<p>IPMICONSOLE TROUBLESHOOTING The following are common
issues for error messages in ipmiconsole.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL unavailable&quot; - SOL is not configured for
use on the remote BMC. It may be not configured in general
or for the specific user specified. Authenticating with a
different user may be sufficient, however the IPMI protocol
does not reveal detail on what is not configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL in use&quot; - SOL is already in use on the
remote BMC. If you do not specify the --dont-steal option,
ipmiconsole will attempt to steal the SOL session away from
the other session.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL session stolen&quot; - Your SOL session has
been stolen by another ses- sion. You may wish to try and
steal the session back by reconnecting.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL requires encryption&quot; - SOL requires a
cipher suite id that includes encryption. Please try to use
cipher suite id 3, 8, or 12. It may also be possible the
encryption requirements are not configured correctly on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;SOL requires no encryption&quot; - SOL requires a
cipher suite id that does not use encryption. Please try to
use cipher suite id 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, or 11. It may also be
possible the encryption requirements are not config- ured
correctly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;BMC Implementation&quot; - The BMC on the remote
machine has a severe prob- lem in its implementation. Please
see the WORKAROUNDS section below for possible workarounds.
If additional vendor workarounds are required, please
contact the authors.</p>

<p>&quot;excess retransmissions sent&quot; - An excessive
number of retransmissions of SOL packets has occurred and
ipmiconsole has given up. This may be due to network issues
or SOL issues. Some of the same issues involved with
&quot;connection timeout&quot; or &quot;session
timeout&quot; errors may be involved. Please try to
reconnect.</p>

<p>&quot;excess errors received&quot; - An excessive number
of SOL packet errors has occurred and ipmiconsole has given
up. This may be due to network issues or SOL issues. Please
try to reconnect.</p>

<p>&quot;BMC Error&quot; - This error usually means a
vendor SOL implementation requires a combination of
authentication, encryption, privilege, etc. that have not
been met by the users choices. Please try a combination of
different cipher suites, privileges, etc. to resolve the
problem. Please see the WORKAROUNDS section below for
possible workarounds too.</p>

<p>WORKAROUNDS With so many different vendors implementing
their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a
number of workarounds currently available to han- dle
discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds
have been implemented so they will be transparent to the
user. However, some will require the user to specify a
workaround be used via the -W option.</p>

<p>The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware
that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware
may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not
listed.</p>

<p>If you believe your hardware has an additional
compliance issue that needs a workaround to be implemented,
please contact the FreeIPMI main- tainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p>authcap - This workaround flag will skip early checks
for username capabilities, authentication capabilities, and
K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It
works around multiple issues in which the remote system does
not properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire
2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p>intel20 - This workaround flag will work around several
Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered
include padding of usernames, and password truncation if the
authentication algorithm is HMAC- MD5-128. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;,
&quot;password invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server
Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p>supermicro20 - This workaround flag will work around
several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI firmware. The issues covered
include handling invalid length authenti- cation codes.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;password
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME
with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver
firmware.</p>

<p>sun20 - This workaround flag will work work around
several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
covered include invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly
hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc
error&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire
4100/4200/4500 with ILOM. This workaround automatically
includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.</p>

<p>opensesspriv - This workaround flag will slightly alter
FreeIPMIs IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an
invalid hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The
privilege level sent during the Open Session stage of an
IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the
privilege level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;password
invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad
rmcpplus status code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun
Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II,
Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta
QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is automatically
triggered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p>integritycheckvalue - This workaround flag will work
around an invalid integrity check value during an IPMI 2.0
session establishment when using Cipher Suite ID 0. The
integrity check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro
512X.</p>

<p>solpayloadsize - This workaround flag will not check for
valid SOL pay- load sizes and assume a proper set. It works
around remote systems that report invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL
payload sizes. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;BMC
Implementation&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec 5441/Dell
Xanadu II, Sun x4100, Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG,
Supermicro X8DTU, and Quanta QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN.</p>

<p>solport - This workaround flag will ignore alternate SOL
ports speci- fied during the protocol. It works around
remote systems that report invalid alternate SOL ports.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;connec- tion
timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus P5MT-R and
Supermicro X8DTH-iF.</p>

<p>solstatus - This workaround flag will not check the
current activation status of SOL during the protocol setup.
It works around remote systems that do not properly support
this command. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;BMC
Error&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro
X8SIL-F.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES On older operating systems, if you input
your username, password, and other potentially security
relevant information on the command line, this information
may be discovered by other users when using tools like the
ps(1) command or looking in the /proc file system. It is
generally more secure to input password information with
options like the -P or -K options. Configuring security
relevant information in the FreeIPMI configuration file
would also be an appropriate way to hide this infor-
mation.</p>

<p>In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will
temporarily &quot;lock up&quot; after a number of remote
authentication errors. You may need to wait awhile in order
to this temporary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may
authenticate again.</p>

<p>Some motherboards define an OEM SOL inactivity timeout
for SOL ses- sions. If SOL sessions stay inactive for long
periods of time, ipmicon- sole sessions may be abruptly
closed, most likely resulting in session timeout errors.
Please see OEM notes for information on modifying this
parameter if you wish for sessions to stay active
longer.</p>

<p>SPECIFIC HARDWARE NOTES Intel SR1520ML/X38ML: After a
reboot, the SOL session appears to &quot;dis- connect&quot;
from the motherboard but stay alive. Character data input
from the ipmiconsole client is accepted by the remote
machine, but no character data or console data is ever sent
back from the remote machine. The SOL session is
subsequently useless. There is currently no workaround in
place to handle this. The session must be closed and
restarted.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # ipmiconsole -h ahost -u myusername -p
mypassword</p>

<p>Establish a console sesssion with a remote host.</p>
