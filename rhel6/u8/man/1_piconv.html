<p>PICONV(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide PICONV(1)</p>

<p>NAME piconv -- iconv(1), reinvented in perl</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS piconv [-f from_encoding] [-t to_encoding] [-s
string] [files...] piconv -l piconv [-C N|-c|-p] piconv -S
scheme ... piconv -r encoding piconv -D ... piconv -h</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION piconv is perl version of iconv, a character
encoding converter widely available for various Unixen
today. This script was primarily a technology demonstrator
for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the place of iconv
for virtually any case.</p>

<p>piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN
or files specified in the argument and prints out to
STDOUT.</p>

<p>Here is the list of options. Each option can be in short
format (-f) or long (--from).</p>

<p>-f,--from from_encoding Specifies the encoding you are
converting from. Unlike iconv, this option can be omitted.
In such cases, the current locale is used.</p>

<p>-t,--to to_encoding Specifies the encoding you are
converting to. Unlike iconv, this option can be omitted. In
such cases, the current locale is used.</p>

<p>Therefore, when both -f and -t are omitted, piconv just
acts like cat.</p>

<p>-s,--string string uses string instead of file for the
source of text.</p>

<p>-l,--list Lists all available encodings, one per line,
in case-insensitive order. Note that only the canonical
names are listed; many aliases exist. For example, the names
are case-insensitive, and many standard and common aliases
work, such as &quot;latin1&quot; for &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;,
or &quot;ibm850&quot; instead of &quot;cp850&quot;, or
&quot;winlatin1&quot; for &quot;cp1252&quot;. See
Encode::Supported for a full discussion.</p>

<p>-C,--check N Check the validity of the stream if N = 1.
When N = -1, something interesting happens when it
encounters an invalid character.</p>

<p>-c Same as &quot;-C 1&quot;.</p>

<p>-p,--perlqq --htmlcref --xmlcref Applies PERLQQ,
HTMLCREF, XMLCREF, respectively. Try</p>

<p>piconv -f utf8 -t ascii --perlqq</p>

<p>To see what it does.</p>

<p>-h,--help Show usage.</p>

<p>-D,--debug Invokes debugging mode. Primarily for Encode
hackers.</p>

<p>-S,--scheme scheme Selects which scheme is to be used
for conversion. Available schemes are as follows:</p>

<p>from_to Uses Encode::from_to for conversion. This is the
default.</p>

<p>decode_encode Input strings are decode()d then
encode()d. A straight two- step implementation.</p>

<p>perlio The new perlIO layer is used. NI-S favorite.</p>

<p>You should use this option if you are using UTF-16 and
others which linefeed is not $/.</p>

<p>Like the -D option, this is also for Encode hackers.</p>
