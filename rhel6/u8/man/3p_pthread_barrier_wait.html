<p>PTHREAD_BARRIER_WAIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_BARRIER_WAIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_barrier_wait - synchronize at a barrier
(ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_barrier_wait(pthread_barrier_t
*barrier);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_barrier_wait() function shall
synchronize participating threads at the barrier referenced
by barrier. The calling thread shall block until the
required number of threads have called pthread_bar-
rier_wait() specifying the barrier.</p>

<p>When the required number of threads have called
pthread_barrier_wait() specifying the barrier, the constant
PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD shall be returned to one
unspecified thread and zero shall be returned to each of the
remaining threads. At this point, the barrier shall be reset
to the state it had as a result of the most recent
pthread_bar- rier_init() function that referenced it.</p>

<p>The constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD is defined in
&lt;pthread.h&gt; and its value shall be distinct from any
other value returned by pthread_barrier_wait().</p>

<p>The results are undefined if this function is called
with an uninitial- ized barrier.</p>

<p>If a signal is delivered to a thread blocked on a
barrier, upon return from the signal handler the thread
shall resume waiting at the barrier if the barrier wait has
not completed (that is, if the required number of threads
have not arrived at the barrier during the execution of the
signal handler); otherwise, the thread shall continue as
normal from the completed barrier wait. Until the thread in
the signal handler returns from it, it is unspecified
whether other threads may proceed past the barrier once they
have all reached it.</p>

<p>A thread that has blocked on a barrier shall not prevent
any unblocked thread that is eligible to use the same
processing resources from even- tually making forward
progress in its execution. Eligibility for pro- cessing
resources shall be determined by the scheduling policy.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
pthread_barrier_wait() function shall return
PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD for a single (arbitrary)
thread synchronized at the barrier and zero for each of the
other threads. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned
to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_barrier_wait() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by barrier does not refer to
an initialized barrier object.</p>

<p>This function shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using this function may
be subject to priority inversion, as discussed in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285,
Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>The pthread_barrier_wait() function is part of the
Barriers option and need not be provided on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>
