<p>ATTR(1) XFS Compatibility API ATTR(1)</p>

<p>NAME attr - extended attributes on XFS filesystem
objects</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS attr [ -LRSq ] -s attrname [ -V attrvalue ]
pathname</p>

<p>attr [ -LRSq ] -g attrname pathname</p>

<p>attr [ -LRSq ] -r attrname pathname</p>

<p>attr [ -LRSq ] -l pathname</p>

<p>OVERVIEW Extended attributes implement the ability for a
user to attach name:value pairs to objects within the XFS
filesystem.</p>

<p>This document describes the attr command, which is
mostly compatible with the IRIX command of the same name. It
is thus aimed specifically at users of the XFS filesystem -
for filesystem independent extended attribute manipulation,
consult the getfattr(1) and setfattr(1) docu- mentation.</p>

<p>Extended attributes can be used to store
meta-information about the file. For example
&quot;character-set=kanji&quot; could tell a document
browser to use the Kanji character set when displaying that
document and &quot;thumbnail=...&quot; could provide a
reduced resolution overview of a high resolution graphic
image.</p>

<p>In the XFS filesystem, the names can be up to 256 bytes
in length, ter- minated by the first 0 byte. The intent is
that they be printable ASCII (or other character set) names
for the attribute. The values can be up to 64KB of arbitrary
binary data.</p>

<p>Attributes can be attached to all types of XFS inodes:
regular files, directories, symbolic links, device nodes,
etc.</p>

<p>XFS uses 2 disjoint attribute name spaces associated
with every filesystem object. They are the root and user
address spaces. The root address space is accessable only to
the superuser, and then only by specifying a flag argument
to the function call. Other users will not see or be able to
modify attributes in the root address space. The user
address space is protected by the normal file permissions
mecha- nism, so the owner of the file can decide who is able
to see and/or modify the value of attributes on any
particular file.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The attr utility allows the manipulation of
extended attributes associ- ated with filesystem objects
from within shell scripts.</p>

<p>There are four main operations that attr can
perform:</p>

<p>GET The -g attrname option tells attr to search the
named object and print (to stdout) the value associated with
that attribute name. With the -q flag, stdout will be
exactly and only the value of the attribute, suitable for
storage directly into a file or pro- cessing via a piped
command.</p>

<p>LIST The -l option tells attr to list the names of all
the attributes that are associated with the object, and the
number of bytes in the value of each of those attributes.
With the -q flag, stdout will be a simple list of only the
attribute names, one per line, suitable for input into a
script.</p>

<p>REMOVE The -r attrname option tells attr to remove an
attribute with the given name from the object if the
attribute exists. There is no output on sucessful
completion.</p>

<p>SET/CREATE The -s attrname option tells attr to set the
named attribute of the object to the value read from stdin.
If an attribute with that name already exists, its value
will be replaced with this one. If an attribute with that
name does not already exist, one will be created with this
value. With the -V attrvalue flag, the attribute will be set
to have a value of attrvalue and stdin will not be read.
With the -q flag, stdout will not be used. Without the -q
flag, a message showing the attribute name and the entire
value will be printed.</p>

<p>When the -L option is given and the named object is a
symbolic link, operate on the attributes of the object
referenced by the symbolic link. Without this option,
operate on the attributes of the symbolic link itself.</p>

<p>When the -R option is given and the process has
appropriate privileges, operate in the root attribute
namespace rather that the USER attribute namespace.</p>

<p>The -S option is similar, except it specifies use of the
security attribute namespace.</p>

<p>When the -q option is given attr will try to keep quiet.
It will out- put error messages (to stderr) but will not
print status messages (to stdout).</p>

<p>NOTES The standard file interchange/archive programs
tar(1), and cpio(1) will not archive or restore extended
attributes, while the xfsdump(8) pro- gram will.</p>

<p>CAVEATS The list option present in the IRIX version of
this command is not sup- ported. getfattr provides a
mechanism to retrieve all of the attribute names.</p>

attr_set(3), attr_multi(3), attr_remove(3), attr(5), and
xfsdump(8).</p>
