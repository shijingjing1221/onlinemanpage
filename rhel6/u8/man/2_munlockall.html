<p>MLOCK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual MLOCK(2)</p>

<p>NAME mlock, munlock, mlockall, munlockall - lock and
unlock memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mlock(const void *addr, size_t len); int
munlock(const void *addr, size_t len);</p>

<p>int mlockall(int flags); int munlockall(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mlock() and mlockall() respectively lock
part or all of the calling processs virtual address space
into RAM, preventing that memory from being paged to the
swap area. munlock() and munlockall() perform the converse
operation, respectively unlocking part or all of the calling
process s virtual address space, so that pages in the
specified virtual address range may once more to be swapped
out if required by the kernel memory manager. Memory locking
and unlocking are performed in units of whole pages.</p>

<p>mlock() and munlock() mlock() locks pages in the address
range starting at addr and continu- ing for len bytes. All
pages that contain a part of the specified address range are
guaranteed to be resident in RAM when the call returns
successfully; the pages are guaranteed to stay in RAM until
later unlocked.</p>

<p>munlock() unlocks pages in the address range starting at
addr and con- tinuing for len bytes. After this call, all
pages that contain a part of the specified memory range can
be moved to external swap space again by the kernel.</p>

<p>mlockall() and munlockall() mlockall() locks all pages
mapped into the address space of the calling process. This
includes the pages of the code, data and stack segment, as
well as shared libraries, user space kernel data, shared
memory, and memory-mapped files. All mapped pages are
guaranteed to be resident in RAM when the call returns
successfully; the pages are guaranteed to stay in RAM until
later unlocked.</p>

<p>The flags argument is constructed as the bitwise OR of
one or more of the following constants:</p>

<p>MCL_CURRENT Lock all pages which are currently mapped
into the address space of the process.</p>

<p>MCL_FUTURE Lock all pages which will become mapped into
the address space of the process in the future. These could
be for instance new pages required by a growing heap and
stack as well as new memory mapped files or shared memory
regions.</p>

<p>If MCL_FUTURE has been specified, then a later system
call (e.g., mmap(2), sbrk(2), malloc(3)), may fail if it
would cause the number of locked bytes to exceed the
permitted maximum (see below). In the same circumstances,
stack growth may likewise fail: the kernel will deny stack
expansion and deliver a SIGSEGV signal to the process.</p>

<p>munlockall() unlocks all pages mapped into the address
space of the calling process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success these system calls return 0. On
error, -1 is returned, errno is set appropriately, and no
changes are made to any locks in the address space of the
process.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOMEM (Linux 2.6.9 and later) the caller had a
non-zero RLIMIT_MEMLOCK soft resource limit, but tried to
lock more memory than the limit permitted. This limit is not
enforced if the process is privileged (CAP_IPC_LOCK).</p>

<p>ENOMEM (Linux 2.4 and earlier) the calling process tried
to lock more than half of RAM.</p>

<p>EPERM (Linux 2.6.9 and later) the caller was not
privileged (CAP_IPC_LOCK) and its RLIMIT_MEMLOCK soft
resource limit was 0.</p>

<p>EPERM (Linux 2.6.8 and earlier) The calling process has
insufficient privilege to call munlockall(). Under Linux the
CAP_IPC_LOCK capability is required.</p>

<p>For mlock() and munlock():</p>

<p>EAGAIN Some or all of the specified address range could
not be locked.</p>

<p>EINVAL len was negative.</p>

<p>EINVAL (Not on Linux) addr was not a multiple of the
page size.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Some of the specified address range does not
correspond to mapped pages in the address space of the
process.</p>

<p>For mlockall():</p>

<p>EINVAL Unknown flags were specified.</p>

<p>For munlockall():</p>

<p>EPERM (Linux 2.6.8 and earlier) The caller was not
privileged (CAP_IPC_LOCK).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001, SVr4.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY On POSIX systems on which mlock() and
munlock() are available, _POSIX_MEMLOCK_RANGE is defined in
&lt;unistd.h&gt; and the number of bytes in a page can be
determined from the constant PAGESIZE (if defined) in
&lt;limits.h&gt; or by calling sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE).</p>

<p>On POSIX systems on which mlockall() and munlockall()
are available, _POSIX_MEMLOCK is defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt;
to a value greater than 0. (See also sysconf(3).)</p>

<p>NOTES Memory locking has two main applications:
real-time algorithms and high-security data processing.
Real-time applications require deter- ministic timing, and,
like scheduling, paging is one major cause of unexpected
program execution delays. Real-time applications will usu-
ally also switch to a real-time scheduler with
sched_setscheduler(2). Cryptographic security software often
handles critical bytes like pass- words or secret keys as
data structures. As a result of paging, these secrets could
be transferred onto a persistent swap store medium, where
they might be accessible to the enemy long after the
security software has erased the secrets in RAM and
terminated. (But be aware that the suspend mode on laptops
and some desktop computers will save a copy of the systems
RAM to disk, regardless of memory locks.)</p>

<p>Real-time processes that are using mlockall() to prevent
delays on page faults should reserve enough locked stack
pages before entering the time-critical section, so that no
page fault can be caused by function calls. This can be
achieved by calling a function that allocates a sufficiently
large automatic variable (an array) and writes to the mem-
ory occupied by this array in order to touch these stack
pages. This way, enough pages will be mapped for the stack
and can be locked into RAM. The dummy writes ensure that not
even copy-on-write page faults can occur in the critical
section.</p>

<p>Memory locks are not inherited by a child created via
fork(2) and are automatically removed (unlocked) during an
execve(2) or when the pro- cess terminates.</p>

<p>The memory lock on an address range is automatically
removed if the address range is unmapped via munmap(2).</p>

<p>Memory locks do not stack, that is, pages which have
been locked sev- eral times by calls to mlock() or
mlockall() will be unlocked by a sin- gle call to munlock()
for the corresponding range or by munlockall(). Pages which
are mapped to several locations or by several processes stay
locked into RAM as long as they are locked at least at one
loca- tion or by at least one process.</p>

<p>Linux Notes Under Linux, mlock() and munlock()
automatically round addr down to the nearest page boundary.
However, POSIX.1-2001 allows an implementation to require
that addr is page aligned, so portable applications should
ensure this.</p>

<p>Limits and permissions In Linux 2.6.8 and earlier, a
process must be privileged (CAP_IPC_LOCK) in order to lock
memory and the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK soft resource limit defines a
limit on how much memory the process may lock.</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.9, no limits are placed on the amount of
memory that a privileged process can lock and the
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK soft resource limit instead defines a limit
on how much memory an unprivileged process may lock.</p>

<p>BUGS In the 2.4 series Linux kernels up to and including
2.4.17, a bug caused the mlockall() MCL_FUTURE flag to be
inherited across a fork(2). This was rectified in kernel
2.4.18.</p>

<p>Since kernel 2.6.9, if a privileged process calls
mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) and later drops privileges (loses the
CAP_IPC_LOCK capability by, for example, setting its
effective UID to a non-zero value), then subse- quent memory
allocations (e.g., mmap(2), brk(2)) will fail if the
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit is encountered.</p>
