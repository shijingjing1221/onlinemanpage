<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME split - Split a string into a proper Tcl list</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS split string ?splitChars?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Returns a list created by splitting string
at each character that is in the splitChars argument. Each
element of the result list will consist of the characters
from string that lie between instances of the charac- ters
in splitChars. Empty list elements will be generated if
string contains adjacent characters in splitChars, or if the
first or last character of string is in splitChars. If
splitChars is an empty string then each character of string
becomes a separate element of the result list. SplitChars
defaults to the standard white-space characters.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Divide up a USENET group name into its
hierarchical components: split
&quot;comp.lang.tcl.announce&quot; . _comp lang tcl
announce</p>

<p>See how the split command splits on every character in
splitChars, which can result in information loss if you are
not careful: split &quot;alpha beta gamma&quot;
&quot;temp&quot; _al {ha b} {} {a ga} {} a</p>

<p>Extract the list words from a string that is not a
well-formed list: split &quot;Example with {unbalanced brace
character&quot; _Example with {unbalanced brace
character</p>

<p>Split a string into its constituent characters split
&quot;Hello world&quot; {} _H e l l o { } w o r l d</p>

<p>PARSING RECORD-ORIENTED FILES Parse a Unix /etc/passwd
file, which consists of one entry per line, with each line
consisting of a colon-separated list of fields: ## Read the
file set fid [open /etc/passwd] set content [read $fid]
close $fid</p>

<p>## Split into records on newlines set records [split
$content &quot;0]</p>

<p>## Iterate over the records foreach rec $records {</p>

<p>## Split into fields on colons set fields [split $rec
&quot;:&quot;]</p>

<p>## Assign fields to variables and print some out...
lassign $fields userName password uid grp longName homeDir
shell puts &quot;$longName uses [file tail $shell] for a
login shell&quot; }</p>
