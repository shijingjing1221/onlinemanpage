<p>NAME fitstopnm - convert a FITS file into a PNM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fitstopnm [-image=N] [-scanmax] [-printmax]
[-min=f] [-max=f] [-omax- val=N [FITSfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>fitstopnm reads a FITS (Flexible Image Transport System)
file as input and produces a PPM image if the FITS file
consists of 3 image planes (NAXIS = 3 and NAXIS3 = 3), or a
PGM image if the FITS file consists of 2 image planes (NAXIS
= 2), or if you specify the -image option.</p>

<p>The program tells you what kind of PNM image it is
writing.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -image=N This is for FITS files with three axes.
The assumption is that the third axis is for multiple
images, and this option lets you select which one you want.
-omaxval=N</p>

<p>This is the maxval that the output PNM image is to
have.</p>

<p>By default, the maxval is the least possible to retain
all the precision of the FITS input. That means the
difference between the highest and lowest sample value in
the input. If the values range from -5 to 100, for example,
the default maxval would be 106 and each PNM sample value
would correspond to one FITS sam- ple value.</p>

<p>For a FITS input with floating point sample values, the
preci- sion is essentially unlimited, so this is not
possible. In that case, the default maxval is simply
255.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007). Before
that, the output maxval is always the default.</p>

<p>-min=float</p>

<p>-max=float</p>

<p>You can use these options to override the min and max
values as read from the FITS header or the image data if the
header has no DATAMIN and DATAMAX keywords.</p>

<p>-scanmax Use this option to force the program to scan
the data even when the header has DATAMIN and DATAMAX.</p>

<p>-printmax With this option, the program just prints the
min and max values and quits without doing its normal
job.</p>

<p>This is for use in shell programs. Example:</p>

<p>eval fitstopnm -printmax $filename | awk {min = $1; max
= $2} END {print &quot;min=&quot; min; &quot; max=&quot;
max}</p>

<p>NOTES Pixel Order You may need to pass the output of
fitstopnm through pamflip -topbot- tom. See pamtofits</p>
