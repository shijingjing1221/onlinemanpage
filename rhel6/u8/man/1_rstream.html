<p>NAME rstream - streaming over RDMA ping-pong test.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rstream [-s server_address] [-b bind_address]
[-f address_format] [-B buffer_size] [-I iterations] [-C
transfer_count] [-S transfer_size] [-p server_port] [-T
test_option]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Uses the streaming over RDMA protocol
(rsocket) to connect and exchange data between a client and
server application.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s server_address The network name or IP address
of the server system listening for connections. The used
name or address must route over an RDMA device. This option
must be specified by the client.</p>

<p>-b bind_address The local network address to bind
to.</p>

<p>-f address_format Supported address formats are ip,
ipv6, gid, or name.</p>

<p>-B buffer_size Indicates the size of the send and
receive network buffers.</p>

<p>-I iterations The number of times that the specified
number of messages will be exchanged between the client and
server. (default 1000)</p>

<p>-C transfer_count The number of messages to transfer
from the client to the server and back again on each
iteration. (default 1)</p>

<p>-S transfer_size The size of each send transfer, in
bytes. (default 1000) If all is specified, rstream will run
a series of tests of vari- ous sizes.</p>

<p>-p server_port The servers port number.</p>

<p>-T test_option Specifies test parameters. Available
options are:</p>

<p>s | socket - uses standard socket calls to transfer
data</p>

<p>a | async - uses asynchronous operation (e.g. select /
poll)</p>

<p>b | blocking - uses blocking calls</p>

<p>f | fork - fork server processing (forces -T s
option)</p>

<p>n | nonblocking - uses non-blocking calls</p>

<p>r | resolve - use rdma cm to resolve address</p>

<p>v | verify - verifies data transfers</p>

<p>NOTES Basic usage is to start rstream on a server
system, then run rstream -s server_name on a client system.
By default, rstream will run a series of latency and
bandwidth performance tests. Specifying a different
iterations, transfer_count, or transfer_size will run a user
customized test using default values where none have been
specified.</p>

<p>Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace,
users must ensure that they have available system resources
and permissions. See the libibverbs README file for
additional details.</p>
