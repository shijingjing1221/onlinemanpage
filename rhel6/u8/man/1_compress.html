<p>COMPRESS(1) COMPRESS(1)</p>

<p>NAME compress, uncompress, zcat - compress and expand
data (version 4.1)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS compress [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -c ] [ -V ] [ -r ] [
-b bits ] [ name ... ] uncompress [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -c ] [ -V
] [ name ... ] zcat [ -V ] [ name ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Compress reduces the size of the named files
using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding. Whenever possible, each
file is replaced by one with the extension .Z, while keeping
the same ownership modes, access and modi- fication times.
If no files are specified, the standard input is com-
pressed to the standard output. Compress will only attempt
to compress regular files. In particular, it will ignore
symbolic links. If a file has multiple hard links, compress
will refuse to compress it unless the -f flag is given.</p>

<p>If -f is not given and compress is run in the
foreground, the user is prompted as to whether an existing
file should be overwritten.</p>

<p>Compressed files can be restored to their original form
using uncom- press or zcat.</p>

<p>uncompress takes a list of files on its command line and
replaces each file whose name ends with .Z and which begins
with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file
without the .Z. The uncompressed file will have the mode,
ownership and timestamps of the compressed file.</p>

<p>The -c option makes compress/uncompress write to the
standard output; no files are changed.</p>

<p>zcat is identical to uncompress -c. zcat uncompresses
either a list of files on the command line or its standard
input and writes the uncom- pressed data on standard output.
zcat will uncompress files that have the correct magic
number whether they have a .Z suffix or not.</p>

<p>If the -r flag is specified, compress will operate
recursively. If any of the file names specified on the
command line are directories, com- press will descend into
the directory and compress all the files it finds there.</p>

<p>The -V flag tells each of these programs to print its
version and patchlevel, along with any preprocessor flags
specified during compila- tion, on stderr before doing any
compression or uncompression.</p>

<p>Compress uses the modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm
popularized in &quot;A Tech- nique for High Performance Data
Compression&quot;, Terry A. Welch, IEEE Com- puter, vol. 17,
no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19. Common substrings in the file
are first replaced by 9-bit codes 257 and up. When code 512
is reached, the algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and
continues to use more bits until the limit specified by the
-b flag is reached (default 16). Bits must be between 9 and
16. The default can be changed in the source to allow
compress to be run on a smaller machine.</p>

<p>After the bits limit is attained, compress periodically
checks the com- pression ratio. If it is increasing,
compress continues to use the existing code dictionary.
However, if the compression ratio decreases, compress
discards the table of substrings and rebuilds it from
scratch. This allows the algorithm to adapt to the next
&quot;block&quot; of the file.</p>

<p>Note that the -b flag is omitted for uncompress, since
the bits parameter specified during compression is encoded
within the output, along with a magic number to ensure that
neither decompression of ran- dom data nor recompression of
compressed data is attempted.</p>

<p>The amount of compression obtained depends on the size
of the input, the number of bits per code, and the
distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as
source code or English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is
generally much better than that achieved by Huffman cod- ing
(as used in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact), and
takes less time to compute.</p>

<p>Under the -v option, a message is printed yielding the
percentage of reduction for each file compressed.</p>

<p>Exit status is normally 0; if the last file is larger
after (attempted) compression, the status is 2; if an error
occurs, exit status is 1.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Usage: compress [-dfvcVr] [-b maxbits] [file
...] Invalid options were specified on the command line.
Missing maxbits Maxbits must follow -b. file: not in
compressed format The file specified to uncompress has not
been compressed. file: compressed with xx bits, can only
handle yy bits File was compressed by a program that could
deal with more bits than the compress code on this machine.
Recompress the file with smaller bits. file: already has .Z
suffix -- no change The file is assumed to be already
compressed. Rename the file and try again. file: filename
too long to tack on .Z The file cannot be compressed because
its name is longer than 12 characters. Rename and try again.
This message does not occur on BSD systems. file already
exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)? Respond
&quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be replaced;
&quot;n&quot; if not. uncompress: corrupt input A SIGSEGV
violation was detected which usually means that the input
file has been corrupted. Compression: xx.xx% Percentage of
the input saved by compression. (Relevant only for -v.) --
not a regular file or directory: ignored When the input file
is not a regular file or directory, (e.g. a symbolic link,
socket, FIFO, device file), it is left unal- tered. -- has
xx other links: unchanged The input file has links; it is
left unchanged. See ln(1) for more information. Use the -f
flag to force compression of mul- tiply-linked files. --
file unchanged No savings is achieved by compression. The
input remains vir- gin.</p>

<p>BUGS Although compressed files are compatible between
machines with large memory, -b12 should be used for file
transfer to architectures with a small process data space
(64KB or less, as exhibited by the DEC PDP series, the Intel
80286, etc.)</p>

<p>Invoking compress with a -r flag will occasionally cause
it to produce spurious error warnings of the form</p>

<p>&quot;&lt;filename&gt;.Z already has .Z suffix -
ignored&quot;</p>

<p>These warnings can be ignored. See the comments in
compress.c:compdir() for an explanation.</p>
