<p>NAME tiffcrop - select, copy, crop, convert, extract,
and/or process one or more TIFF files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiffcrop [ options ] src1.tif ... srcN.tif
dst.tif</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tiffcrop processes one or more files created
according to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0,
specification into one or more TIFF file(s). Tiffcrop is
most often used to extract portions of an image for pro-
cessing with bar code recognizer or OCR software when that
software cannot restrict the region of interest to a
specific portion of the image or to improve efficiency when
the regions of interest must be rotated. It can also be used
to subdivide all or part of a processed image into smaller
sections and export individual images or sections of images
as separate files or separate images within one or more
files derived from the original input image or images.</p>

<p>The available functions can be grouped broadly into
three classes:</p>

<p>Those that select individual images or sections of
images from the input files. The options -N for sequences or
lists of indi- vidual images in the input files, -Z for
zones, -z for regions, -X and -Y for fixed sized selections,
-m for margins, -U for units, and -E for edge reference
provide a variety of ways to specify portions of the input
image.</p>

<p>Those that allow the individual images or selections to
be exported to one or more output files in different
groupings and control the organization of the data in the
output images. The options -P for page size grouping, -S for
subdivision into columns and rows and -e for export mode
options that produce one or more files from each input
image. The options -r, -s, -t, -w control strip and tile
format and sizes while -B -L -c -f modify the endian
addressing scheme, the compression options, and the bit fill
sequence of images as they are written.</p>

<p>Those that perform some action on each image that is
selected from the input file. The options include -R for
rotate, -I for inversion of the photometric interpretation
and/or data values, and -F to flip (mirror) the image
horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>Functions are applied to the input image(s) in the
following order: cropping, fixed area extraction, zone and
region extraction, inversion, mirroring, rotation.</p>

<p>Functions are applied to the output image(s) in the
following order: export mode options for grouping zones,
regions, or images into one or more files, or row and column
divisions with output margins, or page size divisions with
page orientation options.</p>

<p>Finally, strip, tile, byte order, output resolution, and
compression options are applied to all output images.</p>

<p>The output file(s) may be organized and compressed using
a different algorithm from the input files. By default,
tiffcrop will copy all the understood tags in a TIFF
directory of an input file to the associated directory in
the output file. Options can be used to force the resul-
tant image to be written as strips or tiles of data,
respectively.</p>

<p>Tiffcrop can be used to reorganize the storage
characteristics of data in a file, and to reorganize,
extract, rotate, and otherwise process the image data as
specified at the same time whereas tiffcp does not alter the
image data within the file.</p>

<p>Using the options for selecting individual input images
and the options for exporting images and/or segments defined
as zones or regions of each input image, tiffcrop can
perform the functions of tiffcp and tiffsplit in a single
pass while applying multiple operations to indi- vidual
selections or images.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Display the syntax summary for tiffcrop.</p>

<p>-v Report the current version and last modification date
for tiffcrop.</p>

<p>-N odd|even|#,#-#,#|last Specify one or more series or
range(s) of images within each file to process. The words
odd or even may be used to specify all odd or even numbered
images counting from one. Note that internally, TIFF images
are numbered from zero rather than one but since this
convention is not obvious to most users, tiffcrop used 1 to
specifiy the first image in a multipage file. The word last
may be used in place of a number in the sequence to indicate
the final image in the file without knowing how many images
there are. Ranges of images may be specified with a dash and
multiple sets can be indicated by joining them in a
comma-separated list. eg. use -N 1,5-7,last to process the
1st, 5th through 7th, and final image in the file.</p>

<p>-E top|bottom|left|right Specify the top, bottom, left,
or right edge as the reference from which to calcuate the
width and length of crop regions or sequence of postions for
zones. When used with the -e option for exporting zones or
regions, the reference edge determines how composite images
are arranged. Using -E left or right causes successive zones
or regions to be merged horizontally whereas using -E top or
bottom causes successive zones or regions to be arranged
vertically. This option has no effect on export layout when
multiple zones or regions are not being exported to compos-
ite images. Edges may be abbreviated to the first
letter.</p>

<p>-e combined|divided|image|multiple|separate Specify the
export mode for images and selections from input images. The
final filename on the command line is considered to be the
destination file or filename stem for automatically gen-
erated sequences of files. Modes may be abbreviated to the
first letter.</p>

<p>combined All images and selections are written to a
single file with multiple selections from one image combined
into a single image (default)</p>

<p>divided All images and selections are written to a
single file with each selection from one image written to a
new image</p>

<p>image Each input image is written to a new file (numeric
filename sequence) with multiple selections from the image
com- bined into one image</p>

<p>multiple Each input image is written to a new file
(numeric filename sequence) with each selection from the
image written to a new image</p>

<p>separate Individual selections from each image are
written to separate files</p>

<p>-U in|cm|px Specify the type of units to apply to
dimensions for margins and crop regions for input and output
images. Inches or centimeters are converted to pixels using
the resolution unit specified in the TIFF file (which
defaults to inches if not specified in the IFD).</p>

<p>-m #,#,#,# Specify margins to be removed from the input
image. The order must be top, left, bottom, right with only
commas separating the elements of the list. Margins are
scaled according to the cur- rent units and removed before
any other extractions are com- puted..</p>

<p>-X # Set the horizontal (X-axis) dimension of a region
to extract relative to the specified origin reference. If
the origin is the top or bottom edge, the X axis value will
be assumed to start at the left edge.</p>

<p>-Y # Set the vertical (Y-axis) dimension of a region to
extract rela- tive to the specified origin reference. If the
origin is the left or right edge, the Y axis value will be
assumed to start at the top.</p>

<p>-Z #:#,#:# Specify zones of the image designated as
position X of Y equal sized portions measured from the
reference edge, eg 1:3 would be first third of the image
starting from the reference edge minus any margins specified
for the confining edges. Multiple zones can be specified as
a comma separated list but they must reference the same
edge. To extract the top quarter and the bot- tom third of
an image you would use -Z 1:4,3:3.</p>

<p>-z x1,y1,x2,y2: ... :xN,yN,xN+1,yN+1 Specify a series of
coordinates to define regions for processing and exporting.
The coordinates represent the top left and lower right
corners of each region in the current units, eg inch, cm, or
pixels. Pixels are counted from one to width or height and
inches or cm are calculated from image resolution data.</p>

<p>Each colon delimited series of four values represents
the hori- zontal and vertical offsets from the top and left
edges of the image, regardless of the edge specified with
the -E option. The first and third values represent the
horizontal offsets of the corner points from the left edge
while the second and fourth values represent the vertical
offsets from the top edge.</p>

<p>-F horiz|vert Flip, ie mirror, the image or extracted
region horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>-R 90|180|270 Rotate the image or extracted region 90,
180, or 270 degrees clockwise.</p>

<p>-I [black|white|data|both] Invert color space, eg dark
to light for bilevel and grayscale images. This can be used
to modify negative images to positive or to correct images
that have the PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATIN tag set incorrectly.
If the value is black or white, the PHOTOMET-
RIC_INTERPRETATION tag is set to MinIsBlack or MinIsWhite,
with- out altering the image data. If the argument is data
or both, the data values of the image are modified.
Specifying both inverts the data and the
PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION tag, whereas using data inverts
the data but not the PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETA- TION tag. No
support for modifying the color space of color images in
this release.</p>

<p>-H # Set the horizontal resolution of output images to #
expressed in the current units.</p>

<p>-V # Set the vertical resolution of the output images to
# expressed in the current units.</p>

<p>-J # Set the horizontal margin of an output page size to
# expressed in the current units when sectioning image into
columns x rows subimages using the -S cols:rows option.</p>

<p>-K # Set the vertical margin of an output page size to #
expressed in the current units when sectioning image into
columns x rows sub- miages using the -S cols:rows
option.</p>

<p>-O portrait|landscape|auto Set the output orientation of
the pages or sections. Auto will use the arrangement that
requires the fewest pages. This option is only meaningful in
conjunction with the -P option to format an image to fit on
a specific paper size.</p>

<p>-P page Format the output images to fit on page size
paper. Use -P list to show the supported page sizes and
dimensions. You can define a custom page size by entering
the width and length of the page in the current units with
the following format #.#x#.#.</p>

<p>-S cols:rows Divide each image into cols across and rows
down equal sections.</p>

<p>-B Force output to be written with Big-Endian byte
order. This option only has an effect when the output file
is created or overwritten and not when it is appended
to.</p>

<p>-C Suppress the use of strip chopping when reading
images that have a single strip/tile of uncompressed
data.</p>

<p>-c Specify the compression to use for data written to
the output file: none for no compression, packbits for
PackBits compres- sion, lzw for Lempel-Ziv &amp; Welch
compression, jpeg for baseline JPEG compression. zip for
Deflate compression, g3 for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
and g4 for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) com- pression. By default
tiffcrop will compress data according to the value of the
Compression tag found in the source file.</p>

<p>The CCITT Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms can
only be used with bilevel data.</p>

<p>Group 3 compression can be specified together with
several T.4-specific options: 1d for 1-dimensional encoding,
2d for 2-dimensional encoding, and fill to force each
encoded scanline to be zero-filled so that the terminating
EOL code lies on a byte boundary. Group 3-specific options
are specified by appending a :-separated list to the g3
option; e.g. -c g3:2d:fill to get 2D-encoded data with
byte-aligned EOL codes.</p>

<p>LZW compression can be specified together with a
predictor value. A predictor value of 2 causes each scanline
of the out- put image to undergo horizontal differencing
before it is encoded; a value of 1 forces each scanline to
be encoded without differencing. LZW-specific options are
specified by appending a :-separated list to the lzw option;
e.g. -c lzw:2 for LZW compression with horizontal
differencing.</p>

<p>-f Specify the bit fill order to use in writing output
data. By default, tiffcrop will create a new file with the
same fill order as the original. Specifying -f lsb2msb will
force data to be written with the FillOrder tag set to
LSB2MSB, while -f msb2lsb will force data to be written with
the FillOrder tag set to MSB2LSB.</p>

<p>-i Ignore non-fatal read errors and continue processing
of the input file.</p>

<p>-l Specify the length of a tile (in pixels). Tiffcrop
attempts to set the tile dimensions so that no more than 8
kilobytes of data appear in a tile.</p>

<p>-L Force output to be written with Little-Endian byte
order. This option only has an effect when the output file
is created or overwritten and not when it is appended
to.</p>

<p>-M Suppress the use of memory-mapped files when reading
images.</p>

<p>-p Specify the planar configuration to use in writing
image data that has more than one sample per pixel. By
default, tiffcrop will create a new file with the same
planar configuration as the original. Specifying -p contig
will force data to be written with multi-sample data packed
together, while -p separate will force samples to be written
in separate planes.</p>

<p>-r Specify the number of rows (scanlines) in each strip
of data written to the output file. By default (or when
value 0 is specified), tiffcrop attempts to set the
rows/strip that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a
strip. If you specify the special value -1 it will results
in infinite number of the rows per strip. The entire image
will be the one strip in that case.</p>

<p>-s Force the output file to be written with data
organized in strips (rather than tiles).</p>

<p>-t Force the output file to be written with data
organized in tiles (rather than strips).</p>

<p>-w Specify the width of a tile (in pixels). tiffcrop
attempts to set the tile dimensions so that no more than 8
kilobytes of data appear in a tile. tiffcrop attempts to set
the tile dimensions so that no more than 8 kilobytes of data
appear in a tile.</p>

<p>Debug and dump facility -D
opt1:value1,opt2:value2,opt3:value3:opt4:value4 Display pro-
gram progress and/or dump raw data to non-TIFF files.
Options include the following and must be joined as a comma
separated list. The use of this option is generally limited
to program debugging and development of future options. An
equal sign may be substituted for the colon in option:value
pairs.</p>

<p>debug:N Display limited program progress indicators
where larger N increase the level of detail.</p>

<p>format:txt|raw Format any logged data as ASCII text or
raw binary values. ASCII text dumps include strings of ones
and zeroes representing the binary values in the image data
plus identifying headers.</p>

<p>level:N Specify the level of detail presented in the
dump files. This can vary from dumps of the entire input or
output image data to dumps of data processed by specific
functions. Current range of levels is 1 to 3.</p>

<p>input:full-path-to-directory/input-dumpname</p>

<p>output:full-path-to-directory/output-dumpname</p>

<p>When dump files are being written, each image will be
written to a separate file with the name built by adding a
numeric sequence value to the dumpname and an extension of
.txt for ASCII dumps or .bin for binary dumps.</p>

<p>The four debug/dump options are independent, though it
makes little sense to specify a dump file without specifying
a detail level.</p>

<p>Note: Tiffcrop may be compiled with -DDEVELMODE to
enable addi- tional very low level debug reporting.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following concatenates two files and writes
the result using LZW encoding: tiffcrop -c lzw a.tif b.tif
result.tif</p>

<p>To convert a G3 1d-encoded TIFF to a single strip of
G4-encoded data the following might be used: tiffcrop -c g4
-r 10000 g3.tif g4.tif (1000 is just a number that is larger
than the number of rows in the source file.)</p>

<p>To extract a selected set of images from a multi-image
TIFF file use the -N option described above. Thus, to copy
the 1st and 3rd images of image file &quot;album.tif&quot;
to &quot;result.tif&quot;: tiffcrop -N 1,3 album.tif
result.tif</p>

<p>Invert a bilevel image scan of a microfilmed document
and crop off mar- gins of 0.25 inches on the left and right,
0.5 inch on the top, and 0.75 inch on the bottom. From the
remaining portion of the image, select the second and third
quarters, ie, one half of the area left from the center to
each margin. tiffcrop -U in -m 0.5,0.25,0.75,0.25 -E left -Z
2:4,3:4 -I both MicrofilmNegative.tif
MicrofilmPostiveCenter.tif</p>

<p>Extract only the final image of a large Architectural E
sized multipage TIFF file and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise
while reformatting the output to fit on tabloid sized sheets
with one quarter of an inch on each side: tiffcrop -N last
-R 90 -O auto -P tabloid -U in -J 0.25 -K 0.25 -H 300 -V 300
Big-PlatMap.tif BigPlatMap-Tabloid.tif The output images
will have a specified resolution of 300 dpi in both
directions. The orientation of each page will be determined
by whichever choice requires the fewest pages. To specify a
specific ori- entation, use the portrait or landscape
option. The paper size option does not resample the image.
It breaks each original image into a series of smaller
images that will fit on the target paper size at the
specified resolution.</p>

<p>Extract two regions 2048 pixels wide by 2048 pixels high
from each page of a multi-page input file and write each
region to a separate output file. tiffcrop -U px -z
1,1,2048,2048:1,2049,2048,4097 -e separate CheckScans.tiff
Check The output file names will use the stem Check with a
numeric suffix which is incremented for each region of each
image, eg Check-001.tiff, Check-002.tiff ... Check-NNN.tiff.
To produce a unique file for each page of the input image
with one new image for each region of the input image on
that page, change the export option to -e multiple.</p>

<p>NOTES In general, bilevel, grayscale, palette and RGB(A)
data with bit depths from 1 to 32 bits should work in both
interleaved and separate plane formats. Unlike tiffcp,
tiffcrop can read and write tiled images with bits per
sample that are not a multiple of 8 in both interleaved and
separate planar format. Floating point data types are
supported at bit depts of 16, 24, 32 and 64 bits per
sample.</p>

<p>Not all images can be converted from one compression
scheme to another. Data with some photometric
interpretations and/or bit depths are tied to specific
compression schemes and vice-versa, e.g. Group 3/4 compres-
sion is only usable for bilevel data. JPEG compression is
only useable on 8 bit per sample data (or 12 bit if LibTIFF
was compiled with 12 bit JPEG support). Support for OJPEG
compressed images is problematic at best. Since OJPEG
compression is no longer supported for writing images with
LibTIFF, these images will be updated to the newer JPEG
compres- sion when they are copied or processed. This may
cause the image to appear color shifted or distorted after
conversion. In some cases, it is possible to remove the
original compression from image data using the option
-cnone.</p>

<p>Tiffcrop does not currently provide options to up or
downsample data to different bit depths or convert data from
one photometric interpreta- tion to another, e.g. 16 bits
per sample to 8 bits per sample or RGB to grayscale.</p>

<p>Tiffcrop is very loosely derived from code in tiffcp
with extensive modifications and additions to support the
selection of input images and regions and the exporting of
them to one or more output files in various groupings. The
image manipulation routines are entirely new and additional
ones may be added in the future. It will handle tiled images
with bit depths that are not a multiple of eight that tiffcp
may refuse to read.</p>

<p>Tiffcrop was designed to handle large files containing
many moderate sized images with memory usage that is
independent of the number of images in the file. In order to
support compression modes that are not based on individual
scanlines, e.g. JPEG, it now reads images by strip or tile
rather than by indvidual scanlines. In addition to the
memory required by the input and output buffers associated
with LibTIFF one or more buffers at least as large as the
largest image to be read are required. The design favors
large volume document processing uses over scientific or
graphical manipulation of large datasets as might be found
in research or remote sensing scenarios.</p>
