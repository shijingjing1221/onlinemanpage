<p>SMP_DISCOVER_LIST(8) SMP_UTILS SMP_DISCOVER_LIST(8)</p>

<p>NAME smp_discover_list - invoke DISCOVER LIST SMP
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_discover_list [--brief] [--descriptor=TY]
[--filter=FI] [--help] [--hex] [--ignore]
[--interface=PARAMS] [--num=NUM] [--one] [--phy=ID] [--raw]
[--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP)
DISCOVER LIST request function to a SMP target and decodes
or outputs the response. The SMP target is identified by the
SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on the inter- face,
the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. With one
inter- face there is one SMP_DEVICE per machine so the
SMP_DEVICE[,N] syntax is needed to differentiate between
HBAs if there are multiple present.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-b, --brief reduce the decoded response output.</p>

<p>-d, --descriptor=TY DISCOVER response format as
descriptor in the response. When TY is 1 use the short
format (i.e. 24 byte per descriptor) descrip- tor in the
response.</p>

<p>-f, --filter=FI set the filter field in the request.
When FI is 0 (default) fetch descriptors for all phys. When
FI is 1 only fetch descrip- tors for phys attached to
expanders. When FI is 2 only fetch descriptors for phys
attached to expanders or end devices.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore sets the Ignore Zone Group bit in the SMP
Discover list request.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-n, --num=NUM maximum number of descriptors fetch. If
any descriptors are in the response the first phy id will be
greater than or equal to the argument of --phy=ID. Note that
maximum SMP frame size is 1032 bytes (including a trailing 4
byte CRC) which may limit the number of descriptors that can
be fetched by a single DISCOVER LIST function (especially
when --descriptor=0).</p>

<p>-o, --one use one line (summarized) format for each
descriptor in the response. The default action when this
option is not given is to output multiple indented lines for
each descriptor in the response.</p>

<p>-p, --phy=ID phy identifier. ID is a value between 0 and
127. Default is 0. This is the lowest numbered phy id to
attempt fetch in the response. Note that due to the filter
field setting, the first phy id in the response may be
greater than the argument to this option.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>SINGLE LINE FORMAT The --one option causes SMP DISCOVER
LIST descriptors to be compressed to a header section
followed by one line per phy. To save space SAS addresses
are shown in hex without a 0x prefix or h suffix. The header
section outputs information found in the DISCOVER LIST
responses header section.</p>

<p>For each descriptor in the DISCOVER LIST response, one
line is output starting with &quot; phy &lt;n&gt;:&quot;
where &lt;n&gt; is the phy identifier (and they are origin
zero). That is followed by the routing attribute represented
by a single letter which is either &quot;D&quot; for direct
routing, &quot;S&quot; to sub- tractive routing or
&quot;T&quot; for table routing. Then comes the negotiated
physical link rate which is either &quot;disabled&quot;,
&quot;reset problem&quot; or &quot;spinup hold&quot;. Other
states are mapped to &quot;attached&quot;. This includes
enabled phys with nothing connected which appear as
&quot;attached:[0000000000000000:00]&quot;.</p>

<p>Information shown between the brackets is for the
attached device. Phys that are connected display something
like: &quot;attached:[5000c50000520a2a:01 &quot; where the
first number is the attached SAS address (in hex) and the
second number is the attached devices phy identifier. If the
attached device type is other than an end device then one of
these abbreviations is output: &quot;exp&quot; (for
expander), &quot;fex&quot; (for fanout expander) or
&quot;res&quot; (for unknown attached device type). If a phy
is flagged as &quot;virtual&quot; then the letter
&quot;V&quot; appears next. Next are the protocols supported
by the attached device which are shown as
&quot;i(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for initiator protocols and/or
&quot;t(&lt;list&gt;)&quot; for target pro- tocols. The
&lt;list&gt; is made up of &quot;PORT_SEL&quot;,
&quot;SSP&quot;, &quot;STP&quot;, &quot;SMP&quot; and
&quot;SATA&quot; with &quot;+&quot; used as a separator. For
example a SAS host adapter wi11 most likely appear as:
&quot;i(SSP+STP+SMP)&quot;. This completes the infor- mation
about the attached phy, hence the closing right bracket.</p>

<p>Finally, if appropriate, the negotiated physical link
rate is shown in gigabits per second. Here is an example of
a line for expander phy identifier 11 connected to a SATA
target (or SATA &quot;device&quot; to use the t13.org
term):</p>

<p>phy 11:T:attached:[500605b000000afb:00 t(SATA)] 1.5
Gbps</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP DISCOVER LIST function was
introduced in SAS-2 .</p>
