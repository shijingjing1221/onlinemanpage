<p>TTY(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TTY(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tty - return users terminal name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tty</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tty utility shall write to the standard
output the name of the ter- minal that is open as standard
input. The name that is used shall be equivalent to the
string that would be returned by the ttyname() func- tion
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The tty utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN While no input is read from standard input,
standard input shall be examined to determine whether or not
it is a terminal, and, if so, to determine the name of the
terminal.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of tty:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If standard input is a terminal device, a
pathname of the terminal as specified by the ttyname()
function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 shall be written in the following for- mat:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;terminal name&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, a message shall be written indicating that
standard input is not connected to a terminal. In the POSIX
locale, the tty utility shall use the format:</p>

<p>&quot;not a ttn&quot;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Standard input is a terminal.</p>

<p>1 Standard input is not a terminal.</p>

<p>&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This utility checks the status of the
file open as standard input against that of an
implementation-defined set of files. It is possible that no
match can be found, or that the match found need not be the
same file as that which was opened for standard input
(although they are the same device).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
