<p>sane-avision(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-avision(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-avision - SANE backend for original Avision
and Avision OEM scan- ners (HP, Minolta, Mitsubishi, UMAX
and possibly more) flatbed and film scanners.</p>

<p>ABOUT THIS FILE This file is a short descripton for the
avision-backend shipped with SANE.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-avision library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
various Avision scanners and the Avi- sion OEM scanners
labelled by HP, Minolta, Mitsubishi or Fujitsu.</p>

<p>It is fully big-endian aware and in every-day use on
PowerPC and SPARC systems.</p>

<p>I suggest you hold one hand on the power-button of the
scanner while you try the first scans - especially with
film-scanners!</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The configuration file for this backend
resides in /etc/sane.d/avi- sion.conf.</p>

<p>Its contents is a list of device names that correspond
to Avision and Avision compatible scanners and
backend-options. Empty lines and lines starting with a hash
mark (#) are ignored. A sample configuration file is shown
below:</p>

<p># this is a comment</p>

<p>option force-a4 option force-a3 option
disable-gamma-table option disable-calibration</p>

<p>#scsi Vendor Model Type Bus Channel ID LUN scsi AVISION
scsi HP scsi /dev/scanner usb 0x03f0 0x0701</p>

<p>force-a4: Forces the backend to overwrite the scanable
area returned by the scanner to ISO A4. Scanner that are
known to return bogus data are marked in the backend so if
you need this option please report this to the backend
maintainer. USE WITH CARE!</p>

<p>force-a3: Forces the backend to overwrite the scanable
area returned by the scanner to ISO A3. Scanner that are
known to return bogus data are marked in the backend so if
you need this option please report this to the backend
maintainer. USE WITH CARE!</p>

<p>disable-gamma-table: Disables the usage of the scanners
gamma-table. You might try this if your scans hang or only
produces random garbage.</p>

<p>disable-calibration: Disables the scanners color
calibration. You might try this if your scans hang or only
produces random garbage.</p>

<p>Note: Any option above modifies the default code-flow
for your scan- ner. The options should only be used when you
encounter problems with the default be- haviour of the
backend. Please report the need of options to the
backend-author so the backend can be fixed as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>scsi scsi-spec</p>

<p>usb usb-spec</p>

<p>Where scsi-spec is the path-name to a special device or
a device ID for the device that corresponds to a SCSI
scanner. The special device name must be a generic SCSI
device or a symlink to such a device, for exam- ple on Linux
&quot;/dev/sga&quot; or &quot;/dev/sg0&quot;. The device ID
is the ID returned by the scanner, for example
&quot;HP&quot; or &quot;AVISION&quot;. See sane-scsi(5) for
details.</p>

<p>Note: Since the backend now includes native USB access,
it is no longer needed - even considered obsolete - to
access USB scanner via the SCSI emulation (named hpusbscsi
on Linux) for Avision USB devices such as the HP 53xx, HP
74xx or Minolta film-scan- ners.</p>

<p>usb-spec is the USB device name, the vendor/product ID
pair or the name used by libusb corresponding to the USB
scanner. For example &quot;0x03f0 0x0701&quot; or
&quot;libusb:002:003&quot;. See sane-usb(5) for details.</p>

<p>The program sane-find-scanner helps to find out the
correct scsi or usb device name.</p>

<p>A list with supported devices is built into the avision
backend so nor- mally specifying an ID should not be
necessary.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/avision.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-avision.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-avision.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_AVISION If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels
increase the verbosity of the output. The debug level 7 is
the authors prefered value to debug backend problems.</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_AVISION=7</p>
