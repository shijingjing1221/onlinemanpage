<p>NAME ypxfr - transfer NIS database from remote server to
local host</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/lib64/yp/ypxfr [ -f ] [ -c ] [ -d target
domain ] [ -h source host ] [ -s source domain ] [ -C taskid
program-number ipaddr port ] [ -p yp_path ] mapname ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ypxfr copies an NIS database from one NIS
server to the local host by using the NIS service. ypxfr is
generally invoked by ypinit or by ypserv, when ypserv
receives a map transfer request from yppush. It creates a
temporary map in the directory /var/yp/domain (this direc-
tory must already exist; domain is the default domainname
for the local host), fills it by getting the map s entries
and fetches the map parameters (master and order number). If
the transfer was successful, the old version of the map will
be deleted and the temporary copy will be moved into its
place. Then, ypxfr will attempt to send a &quot;clear
current map&quot; request to the local ypserv.</p>

<p>If run interactively, ypxfr writes its output to stderr.
However, if it is invoked without a controlling terminal, it
will log the output to syslog.</p>

<p>ypxfr is used primarily in environments where several
NIS servers are in use. For all maps, you have a NIS master
server, which maintains a canonical copy of the NIS map, and
all the other servers, the NIS slaves, copy the new version
of the map from the master whenever a update was made.
Normally, you have one NIS master for all maps.</p>

<p>In order to maintain consistency across all NIS servers,
ypxfr can be run periodically in a cron job. Maps which
change infrequently need only be updated once a day
(preferably late at night when system usage is lowest),
where those with frequent changes (such as passwd.byname and
passwd.byuid ) should be updated perhaps once every hour.
Examples are in /usr/lib64/yp: ypxfr_1perday, ypxfr_2perday,
and ypxfr_1perhour. They can serve as reasonable first
cuts.</p>

<p>Normally all updates should be propagated by yppush when
/var/yp/Make- file is run on the NIS master server, however
it is a good practice on large networks where possible
outages could cause NIS slaves to fall out of sync with the
master.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-f Force a map transfer. Normally, ypxfr will not
transfer a map if it determines that the NIS masters copy is
not newer than the existing copy already on the local host.
This flag forces a transfer regardless of which servers
version is more recent.</p>

<p>-c Do not send a &quot;clear current map&quot; request
to the ypserv process running on the local host. This flag
is normally used when invoking ypxfr by ypinit or if ypserv
is not running locally at the time you are running ypxfr.
Otherwise, ypxfr will com- plain that it cannot talk to the
local ypserv, and the transfer will fail.</p>

<p>-d domain Specify a domain other than the default NIS
domain.</p>

<p>-h source host Get the map from host, regardless of what
the map says the mas- ter is. If host is not specified,
ypxfr asks the NIS service for the name of the master, and
tries to get the map from there. This option is used to
insure that ypxfr only copies maps from the NIS master
server.</p>

<p>-s source domain Specify a source domain from which to
transfer a map that should be the same across domains.</p>

<p>-C taskid progam-number ipaddr port This option is only
for use by ypserv . When ypserv invokes ypxfr, it specifies
that ypxfr should call back a yppush process at the host
with IP address ipaddr, registered as program number
progam-number, listening on port port, and waiting for a
response to transaction taskid.</p>

<p>-p yp_path Change the directory for the maps to
yp_path/[domainname]/, the default is
/var/yp/[domainname].</p>

<p>mapname One or more names of the map to transfer.</p>

<p>FILES /var/yp/[domainname]/[maps]</p>
