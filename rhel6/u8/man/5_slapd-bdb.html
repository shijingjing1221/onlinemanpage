<p>SLAPD-BDB(5) SLAPD-BDB(5)</p>

<p>NAME slapd-bdb, slapd-hdb - Berkeley DB backends to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The bdb backend to slapd(8) uses the Oracle
Berkeley DB (BDB) package to store data. It makes extensive
use of indexing and caching to speed data access.</p>

<p>Note that BDB is deprecated and support will be dropped
in future OpenLDAP releases. Installations should use the
mdb backend instead.</p>

<p>hdb is a variant of the bdb backend that uses a
hierarchical database layout which supports subtree renames.
It is both more space-efficient and more execution-efficient
than the bdb backend. It is otherwise identical to the bdb
behavior, and all the same configuration options apply.</p>

<p>It is noted that these options are intended to
complement Berkeley DB configuration options set in the
environment s DB_CONFIG file. See Berkeley DB documentation
for details on DB_CONFIG configuration options. Where there
is overlap, settings in DB_CONFIG take prece- dence.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf options apply to the bdb
and hdb backend database. That is, they must follow a
&quot;database bdb&quot; or &quot;database hdb&quot; line
and come before any subsequent &quot;backend&quot; or
&quot;database&quot; lines. Other database options are
described in the slapd.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>cachesize &lt;integer&gt; Specify the size in entries of
the in-memory entry cache main- tained by the bdb or hdb
backend database instance. The default is 1000 entries.</p>

<p>cachefree &lt;integer&gt; Specify the number of entries
to free from the entry cache when the cache reaches the
cachesize limit. The default is 1 entry.</p>

<p>checkpoint &lt;kbyte&gt; &lt;min&gt; Specify the
frequency for checkpointing the database transaction log. A
checkpoint operation flushes the database buffers to disk
and writes a checkpoint record in the log. The checkpoint
will occur if either &lt;kbyte&gt; data has been written or
&lt;min&gt; min- utes have passed since the last checkpoint.
Both arguments default to zero, in which case they are
ignored. When the &lt;min&gt; argument is non-zero, an
internal task will run every &lt;min&gt; min- utes to
perform the checkpoint. See the Berkeley DB reference guide
for more details.</p>

<p>checksum Enable checksum validation of DB pages whenever
they are read from disk. This setting can only be configured
before any database files are created.</p>

<p>cryptfile &lt;file&gt; Specify the pathname of a file
containing an encryption key to use for encrypting the
database. Encryption is performed using Berkeley DBs
implementation of AES. Note that encryption can only be
configured before any database files are created, and
changing the key can only be done after destroying the
current database and recreating it. Encryption is not
enabled by default, and some distributions of Berkeley DB do
not support encryption.</p>

<p>cryptkey &lt;key&gt; Specify an encryption key to use
for encrypting the database. This option may be used when a
separate cryptfile is not desired. Only one of cryptkey or
cryptfile may be configured.</p>

<p>dbconfig &lt;Berkeley-DB-setting&gt; Specify a
configuration directive to be placed in the DB_CONFIG file
of the database directory. The dbconfig directive is just a
convenience to allow all necessary configuration to be set
in the slapd.conf file. The options set using this directive
will only be written to the DB_CONFIG file if no such file
existed at server startup time, otherwise they are
completely ignored. This allows one to set initial values
without overwriting/destroying a DB_CONFIG file that was
already customized through other means. This directive may
be specified multiple times, as needed. For example:
dbconfig set_cachesize 0 1048576 0 dbconfig set_lg_bsize
2097152</p>

<p>dbnosync Specify that on-disk database contents should
not be immediately synchronized with in memory changes.
Enabling this option may improve performance at the expense
of data security. See the Berkeley DB reference guide for
more details.</p>

<p>dbpagesize &lt;dbfile&gt; &lt;size&gt; Specify the page
size to use for a particular database file, in units of 1024
bytes. The default for the id2entry file is 16, the default
for all other files depends on the size of the underlying
filesystem s block size (typically 4 or 8). The max- imum
that BerkeleyDB supports is 64. This setting usually should
not need to be changed, but if BerkeleyDBs &quot;db_stat
-d&quot; shows a large amount of overflow pages in use in a
file, setting a larger size may increase performance at the
expense of data integrity. This setting only takes effect
when a database is being newly created. See the Berkeley DB
reference guide for more details.</p>

<p>directory &lt;directory&gt; Specify the directory where
the BDB files containing this database and associated
indexes live. A separate directory must be specified for
each database. The default is /var/openl- dap-data.</p>

<p>dirtyread Allow reads of modified but not yet committed
data. Usually transactions are isolated to prevent other
operations from accessing uncommitted data. This option may
improve perfor- mance, but may also return inconsistent
results if the data comes from a transaction that is later
aborted. In this case, the modified data is discarded and a
subsequent search will return a different result.</p>

<p>dncachesize &lt;integer&gt; Specify the maximum number
of DNs in the in-memory DN cache. Ideally this cache should
be large enough to contain the DNs of every entry in the
database. If set to a smaller value than the cachesize it
will be silently increased to equal the cachesize. The
default value is 0 which means unlimited, i.e. the DN cache
will grow without bound.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the DN cache is allowed to
temporarily grow beyond the configured size. It does this if
many entries are locked when it tries to do a purge, because
that means they re legitimately in use. Also, the DN cache
never purges entries that have cached children, so depending
on the shape of the DIT, it could have lots of cached DNs
over the defined limit.</p>

<p>idlcachesize &lt;integer&gt; Specify the size of the
in-memory index cache, in index slots. The default is zero.
A larger value will speed up frequent searches of indexed
entries. An hdb database needs a large idl- cachesize for
good search performance, typically three times the cachesize
(entry cache size) or larger.</p>

<p>index {&lt;attrlist&gt;|default}
[pres,eq,approx,sub,&lt;special&gt;] Specify the indexes to
maintain for the given attribute (or list of attributes).
Some attributes only support a subset of indexes. If only an
&lt;attr&gt; is given, the indices specified for default are
maintained. Note that setting a default does not imply that
all attributes will be indexed. Also, for best per-
formance, an eq index should always be configured for the
objectClass attribute.</p>

<p>A number of special index parameters may be specified.
The index type sub can be decomposed into subinitial,
subany, and subfinal indices. The special type nolang may be
specified to disallow use of this index by language
subtypes. The special type nosubtypes may be specified to
disallow use of this index by named subtypes. Note: changing
index settings in slapd.conf(5) requires rebuilding indices,
see slapindex(8); changing index settings dynamically by
LDAPModifying &quot;cn=config&quot; automatically causes
rebuilding of the indices online in a back- ground task.</p>

<p>linearindex Tell slapindex to index one attribute at a
time. By default, all indexed attributes in an entry are
processed at the same time. With this option, each indexed
attribute is processed individu- ally, using multiple passes
through the entire database. This option improves slapindex
performance when the database size exceeds the dbcache size.
When the dbcache is large enough, this option is not needed
and will decrease performance. Also by default, slapadd
performs full indexing and so a separate slapindex run is
not needed. With this option, slapadd does no indexing and
slapindex must be used.</p>

<p>lockdetect {oldest|youngest|fewest|random|default}
Specify which transaction to abort when a deadlock is
detected. The default is random.</p>

<p>mode &lt;integer&gt; Specify the file protection mode
that newly created database index files should have. The
default is 0600.</p>

<p>searchstack &lt;depth&gt; Specify the depth of the stack
used for search filter evalua- tion. Search filters are
evaluated on a stack to accommodate nested AND / OR clauses.
An individual stack is assigned to each server thread. The
depth of the stack determines how complex a filter can be
evaluated without requiring any additional memory
allocation. Filters that are nested deeper than the search
stack depth will cause a separate stack to be allocated for
that par- ticular search operation. These allocations can
have a major negative impact on server performance, but
specifying too much stack will also consume a great deal of
memory. Each search stack uses 512K bytes per level. The
default stack depth is 16, thus 8MB per thread is used.</p>

<p>shm_key &lt;integer&gt; Specify a key for a shared
memory BDB environment. By default the BDB environment uses
memory mapped files. If a non-zero value is specified, it
will be used as the key to identify a shared memory region
that will house the environment.</p>

control semantics as indicated in slapd.access(5).</p>
