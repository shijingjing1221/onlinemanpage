<p>NAME vfs_time_audit - samba vfs module to log slow VFS
operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = time_audit</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The time_audit VFS module logs system calls that take
longer than the number of milliseconds defined by the
variable time_audit:audit_timeout. It will log the calls and
the time spent in it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of comparable with strace -T and is
helpful to reveal performance problems with the underlying
file and storage subsystems.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS time_audit:audit_timeout = number of
milliseconds VFS calls that take longer than the defined
number of milliseconds that should be logged. The default is
10000 (10s).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This would log VFS calls that take longer than
3 seconds:</p>

<p>[sample_share] path = /test/sample_share vfs objects =
time_audit time_audit: audit_timeout = 3000</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.6.0 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The time_audit VFS module was created with contributions
from Abhidnya Chirmule.</p>
