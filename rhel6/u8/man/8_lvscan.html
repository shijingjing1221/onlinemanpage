<p>NAME lvscan scan (all disks) for Logical Volumes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvscan [-a|--all] [-b|--blockdevice]
[--commandprofile ProfileName] [-d|--debug] [-h|--help]
[--ignorelockingfailure] [-P|--partial] [-v|--verbose]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvscan scans all known volume groups or all
supported LVM block devices in the system for defined
Logical Volumes. The output consists of one line for each
Logical Volume indicating whether or not it is active, a
snapshot or origin, the size of the device and its
allocation policy. Use lvs(8) or lvdisplay(8) to obtain
more-comprehensive information about the Logical
Volumes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>--all Include information in the output about internal
Logical Volumes that are components of normally-accessible
Logical Volumes, such as mirrors, but which are not
independently accessible (e.g. not mountable). For example,
after creating a mirror using lvcreate -m1 --mirrorlog disk,
this option will reveal three internal Logical Volumes, with
suffixes mimage_0, mimage_1, and mlog.</p>

<p>-b, --blockdevice This option is now ignored. Instead,
use lvs(8) or lvdisplay(8) to obtain the device number.</p>

<p>--cache LogicalVolume Applicable only when lvmetad(8) is
in use (see also lvm.conf(5), global/use_lvmetad). This
command issues a rescan of physical volume labels and
metadata areas of all PVs that the logical volume uses. In
particular, this can be used when a RAID logical volume
becomes degraded, to update information about physical
volume availability. This is only necessary if the logical
vol- ume is not being monitored by dmeventd (see
lvchange(8), option --monitor).</p>
