<p>NAME splitdiff - separate out incremental patches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS splitdiff [-a] [-d] [-p n] [file]</p>

<p>splitdiff {[--help] | [--version]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If you have a patch file composed of several
incremental patches, you can use splitdiff to separate them
out. You may want to do this in preparation for re-combining
them with combinediff(1).</p>

<p>The effect of running splitdiff is to separate its input
into a set of output files, with no output file patching the
same file more than once.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Split out every single file-level patch.</p>

<p>-d Create file names such as a_b.c for a patch that
modifies a/b.c.</p>

<p>-p n Strip the first n components of the pathname to aid
comparisons.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of splitdiff.</p>
