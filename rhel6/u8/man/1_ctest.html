<p>NAME ctest - Testing driver provided by CMake.</p>

<p>USAGE ctest [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;ctest&quot; executable is the
CMake test driver program. CMake-gener- ated build trees
created for projects that use the ENABLE_TESTING and
ADD_TEST commands have testing support. This program will
run the tests and report results.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C &lt;cfg&gt;, --build-config &lt;cfg&gt;
Choose configuration to test.</p>

<p>Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build
config- urations in the same tree. This option can be used
to specify which one should be tested. Example
configurations are &quot;Debug&quot; and
&quot;Release&quot;.</p>

<p>-V,--verbose Enable verbose output from tests.</p>

<p>Test output is normally suppressed and only summary
information is displayed. This option will show all test
output.</p>

<p>-VV,--extra-verbose Enable more verbose output from
tests.</p>

<p>Test output is normally suppressed and only summary
information is displayed. This option will show even more
test output.</p>

<p>--debug Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.</p>

<p>This feature will result in a large number of output
that is mostly useful for debugging dashboard problems.</p>

<p>--output-on-failure Output anything outputted by the
test program if the test should fail. This option can also
be enabled by setting the environ- ment variable
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE</p>

<p>-F Enable failover.</p>

<p>This option allows ctest to resume a test set execution
that was previously interrupted. If no interruption
occurred, the -F option will have no effect.</p>

<p>-j &lt;jobs&gt;, --parallel &lt;jobs&gt; Run the tests
in parallel using thegiven number of jobs.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to run the tests in parallel
using given number of jobs. This option can also be set by
setting the environment variable CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL.</p>

<p>-Q,--quiet Make ctest quiet.</p>

<p>This option will suppress all the output. The output log
file will still be generated if the --output-log is
specified. Options such as --verbose, --extra-verbose, and
--debug are ignored if --quiet is specified.</p>

<p>-O &lt;file&gt;, --output-log &lt;file&gt; Output to log
file</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to write all its output to a log
file.</p>

<p>-N,--show-only Disable actual execution of tests.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to list the tests that would be
run but not actually run them. Useful in conjunction with
the -R and -E options.</p>

<p>-L &lt;regex&gt;, --label-regex &lt;regex&gt; Run tests
with labels matching regular expression.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose
labels match the given regular expression.</p>

<p>-R &lt;regex&gt;, --tests-regex &lt;regex&gt; Run tests
matching regular expression.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose
names match the given regular expression.</p>

<p>-E &lt;regex&gt;, --exclude-regex &lt;regex&gt; Exclude
tests matching regular expression.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose names
match the given regular expression.</p>

<p>-LE &lt;regex&gt;, --label-exclude &lt;regex&gt; Exclude
tests with labels matching regular expression.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose
labels match the given regular expression.</p>

<p>-D &lt;dashboard&gt;, --dashboard &lt;dashboard&gt;
Execute dashboard test</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client and
perform a dashboard test. All tests are
&lt;Mode&gt;&lt;Test&gt;, where Mode can be Experimental,
Nightly, and Continuous, and Test can be Start, Update,
Configure, Build, Test, Coverage, and Submit.</p>

<p>-D &lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt; Define a
variable for script mode</p>

<p>Pass in variable values on the command line. Use in
conjunction with -S to pass variable values to a dashboard
script. Parsing -D arguments as variable values is only
attempted if the value following -D does not match any of
the known dashboard types.</p>

<p>-M &lt;model&gt;, --test-model &lt;model&gt; Sets the
model for a dashboard</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client where
the Test- Model can be Experimental, Nightly, and
Continuous. Combining -M and -T is similar to -D</p>

<p>-T &lt;action&gt;, --test-action &lt;action&gt; Sets the
dashboard action to perform</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to act as a Dart client and
perform some action such as start, build, test etc.
Combining -M and -T is similar to -D</p>

<p>--track &lt;track&gt; Specify the track to submit
dashboard to</p>

<p>Submit dashboard to specified track instead of default
one. By default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly,
Experimental, or Continuous track, but by specifying this
option, the track can be arbitrary.</p>

<p>-S &lt;script&gt;, --script &lt;script&gt; Execute a
dashboard for a configuration</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to load in a configuration
script which sets a number of parameters such as the binary
and source direc- tories. Then ctest will do what is
required to create and run a dashboard. This option
basically sets up a dashboard and then runs ctest -D with
the appropriate options.</p>

<p>-SP &lt;script&gt;, --script-new-process &lt;script&gt;
Execute a dashboard for a configuration</p>

<p>This option does the same operations as -S but it will
do them in a separate process. This is primarily useful in
cases where the script may modify the environment and you do
not want the modified environment to impact other -S
scripts.</p>

<p>-A &lt;file&gt;, --add-notes &lt;file&gt; Add a notes
file with submission</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to include a notes file when
submitting dashboard.</p>

<p>-I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file],
--tests-information Run a specific number of tests by
number.</p>

<p>This option causes ctest to run tests starting at number
Start, ending at number End, and incrementing by Stride. Any
additional numbers after Stride are considered individual
test numbers. Start, End,or stride can be empty. Optionally
a file can be given that contains the same syntax as the
command line.</p>

<p>-U, --union Take the Union of -I and -R</p>

<p>When both -R and -I are specified by default the
intersection of tests are run. By specifying -U the union of
tests is run instead.</p>

<p>--max-width &lt;width&gt; Set the max width for a test
name to output</p>

<p>Set the maximum width for each test name to show in the
output. This allows the user to widen the output to avoid
clipping the test name which can be very annoying.</p>

<p>--interactive-debug-mode [0|1] Set the interactive mode
to 0 or 1.</p>

<p>This option causes ctest to run tests in either an
interactive mode or a non-interactive mode. On Windows this
means that in non-interactive mode, all system debug pop up
windows are blocked. In dashboard mode (Experimental,
Nightly, Continuous), the default is non-interactive. When
just running tests not for a dashboard the default is to
allow popups and interactive debugging.</p>

<p>--no-label-summary Disable timing summary information
for labels.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest not to print summary information
for each label associated with the tests run. If there are
no labels on the tests, nothing extra is printed.</p>

<p>--build-and-test Configure, build and run a test.</p>

<p>This option tells ctest to configure (i.e. run cmake
on), build, and or execute a test. The configure and test
steps are optional. The arguments to this command line are
the source and binary directories. By default this will run
CMake on the Source/Bin directories specified unless
--build-nocmake is spec- ified. Both --build-makeprogram and
--build-generator MUST be provided to use --build-and-test.
If --test-command is specified then that will be run after
the build is complete. Other options that affect this mode
are --build-target --build-nocmake, --build-run-dir,
--build-two-config, --build-exe-dir,
--build-project,--build-noclean, --build-options</p>

<p>--build-target Specify a specific target to build.</p>

<p>This option goes with the --build-and-test option, if
left out the all target is built.</p>

<p>--build-nocmake Run the build without running cmake
first.</p>

<p>Skip the cmake step.</p>

<p>--build-run-dir Specify directory to run programs
from.</p>

<p>Directory where programs will be after it has been
compiled.</p>

<p>--build-two-config Run CMake twice</p>

<p>--build-exe-dir Specify the directory for the
executable.</p>

<p>--build-generator Specify the generator to use.</p>

<p>--build-generator-toolset Specify the generator-specific
toolset.</p>

<p>--build-project Specify the name of the project to
build.</p>

<p>--build-makeprogram Specify the make program to use.</p>

<p>--build-noclean Skip the make clean step.</p>

<p>--build-config-sample A sample executable to use to
determine the configuration</p>

<p>A sample executable to use to determine the
configuration that should be used. e.g.
Debug/Release/etc</p>

<p>--build-options Add extra options to the build step.</p>

<p>This option must be the last option with the exception
of --test-command</p>

<p>--test-command The test to run with the --build-and-test
option.</p>

<p>--test-timeout The time limit in seconds, internal use
only.</p>

<p>--tomorrow-tag Nightly or experimental starts with next
day tag.</p>

<p>This is useful if the build will not finish in one
day.</p>

<p>--ctest-config The configuration file used to initialize
CTest state when sub- mitting dashboards.</p>

<p>This option tells CTest to use different initialization
file instead of CTestConfiguration.tcl. This way multiple
initializa- tion files can be used for example to submit to
multiple dash- boards.</p>

<p>--overwrite Overwrite CTest configuration option.</p>

<p>By default ctest uses configuration options from
configuration file. This option will overwrite the
configuration option.</p>

<p>--extra-submit &lt;file&gt;[;&lt;file&gt;] Submit extra
files to the dashboard.</p>

<p>This option will submit extra files to the
dashboard.</p>

<p>--force-new-ctest-process Run child CTest instances as
new processes</p>

<p>By default CTest will run child CTest instances within
the same process. If this behavior is not desired, this
argument will enforce new processes for child CTest
processes.</p>

<p>--schedule-random Use a random order for scheduling
tests</p>

<p>This option will run the tests in a random order. It is
commonly used to detect implicit dependencies in a test
suite.</p>

<p>--submit-index Submit individual dashboard tests with
specific index</p>

<p>This option allows performing the same CTest action
(such as test) multiple times and submit all stages to the
same dashboard (Dart2 required). Each execution requires
different index.</p>

<p>--timeout &lt;seconds&gt; Set a global timeout on all
tests.</p>

<p>This option will set a global timeout on all tests that
do not already have a timeout set on them.</p>

<p>--stop-time &lt;time&gt; Set a time at which all tests
should stop running.</p>

<p>Set a real time of day at which all tests should
timeout. Exam- ple: 7:00:00 -0400. Any time format
understood by the curl date parser is accepted. Local time
is assumed if no timezone is specified.</p>

<p>--http1.0 Submit using HTTP 1.0.</p>

<p>This option will force CTest to use HTTP 1.0 to submit
files to the dashboard, instead of HTTP 1.1.</p>

<p>--no-compress-output Do not compress test output when
submitting.</p>

<p>This flag will turn off automatic compression of test
output. Use this to maintain compatibility with an older
version of CDash which doesnt support compressed test
output.</p>

<p>--print-labels Print all available test labels.</p>

<p>This option will not run any tests, it will simply print
the list of all labels associated with the test set.</p>

<p>--help-command &lt;cmd&gt; [&lt;file&gt;] Show help for
a single command and exit.</p>

<p>Prints the help for the command to stdout or to the
specified file.</p>

<p>--help-command-list [&lt;file&gt;] List available
commands and exit.</p>

<p>Prints the list of all available listfile commands to
stdout or the specified file.</p>

<p>--help-commands [&lt;file&gt;] Print help for all
commands and exit.</p>

<p>Prints the help for all commands to stdout or to the
specified file.</p>

<p>--copyright [file] Print the CMake copyright and
exit.</p>

<p>If a file is specified, the copyright is written into
it.</p>

<p>--help,-help,-usage,-h,-H,/? Print usage information and
exit.</p>

<p>Usage describes the basic command line interface and its
options.</p>

<p>--help-full [file] Print full help and exit.</p>

<p>Full help displays most of the documentation provided by
the UNIX man page. It is provided for use on non-UNIX
platforms, but is also convenient if the man page is not
installed. If a file is specified, the help is written into
it.</p>

<p>--help-html [file] Print full help in HTML format.</p>

<p>This option is used by CMake authors to help produce web
pages. If a file is specified, the help is written into
it.</p>

<p>--help-man [file] Print full help as a UNIX man page and
exit.</p>

<p>This option is used by the cmake build to generate the
UNIX man page. If a file is specified, the help is written
into it.</p>

<p>--version,-version,/V [file] Show program name/version
banner and exit.</p>

<p>If a file is specified, the version is written into
it.</p>

<p>GENERATORS The following generators are available on
this platform:</p>

<p>COMMANDS break Break from an enclosing foreach or while
loop.</p>

<p>break()</p>

<p>Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop</p>

<p>build_name Deprecated. Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and
${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.</p>

<p>build_name(variable)</p>

<p>Sets the specified variable to a string representing the
plat- form and compiler settings. These values are now
available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
variables.</p>

<p>cmake_host_system_information Query host system specific
information.</p>

<p>cmake_host_system_information(RESULT &lt;variable&gt;
QUERY &lt;key&gt; ...)</p>

<p>Queries system information of the host system on which
cmake runs. One or more &lt;key&gt; can be provided to
select the informa- tion to be queried. The list of queried
values is stored in &lt;variable&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;key&gt; can be one of the following values:</p>

<p>NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES = Number of logical cores.
NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES = Number of physical cores.
HOSTNAME = Hostname. FQDN = Fully qualified domain name.
TOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY = Total virtual memory in megabytes.
AVAILABLE_VIRTUAL_MEMORY = Available virtual memory in
megabytes. TOTAL_PHYSICAL_MEMORY = Total physical memory in
megabytes. AVAILABLE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY = Available physical
memory in megabytes.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required Set the minimum required version
of cmake for a project.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] [FATAL_ERROR])</p>

<p>If the current version of CMake is lower than that
required it will stop processing the project and report an
error. When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the
command implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]])</p>

<p>which sets the cmake policy version level to the version
speci- fied. When version 2.4 or lower is given the command
implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)</p>

<p>which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and
lower.</p>

<p>The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake
2.6 and higher. It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4
and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.</p>

<p>cmake_policy Manage CMake Policy settings.</p>

<p>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change
existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve
implementations of existing features. The CMake Policy
mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in
behavior. Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an
identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where
&quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer index. Documentation
associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW
behavior and the reason the policy was introduced. Projects
may set each policy to select the desired behavior. When
CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a
setting specified by the project. If no setting is available
the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced
requesting that the policy be set.</p>

<p>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD
or NEW behavior. While setting policies individually is
supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on
CMake versions.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])</p>

<p>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for
the given version of CMake. All policies introduced in the
speci- fied version or earlier will be set to use NEW
behavior. All policies introduced after the specified
version will be unset (unless variable
CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default). This
effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake
version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their
new policies. The policy version specified must be at least
2.4 or the command will report an error. In order to get
compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4
see documentation of policy CMP0001.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW) cmake_policy(SET
CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)</p>

<p>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given
policy. Projects depending on the old behavior of a given
policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy
state to OLD. Alternatively one may fix the project to work
with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW
behavior. The output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot;
or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set, and empty
otherwise.</p>

<p>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made
by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the
stack. A new entry on the policy stack is managed
automatically for each sub- directory to protect its parents
and siblings. CMake also man- ages a new entry for scripts
loaded by include() and find_pack- age() commands except
when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also
policy CMP0011). The cmake_policy command pro- vides an
interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(PUSH) cmake_policy(POP)</p>

<p>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy
settings.</p>

<p>Functions and macros record policy settings when they
are cre- ated and use the pre-record policies when they are
invoked. If the function or macro implementation sets
policies, the changes automatically propagate up through
callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack
entry.</p>

<p>configure_file Copy a file to another location and
modify its contents.</p>

<p>configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt; [COPYONLY]
[ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY] [NEWLINE_STYLE
[UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])</p>

<p>Copies a file &lt;input&gt; to file &lt;output&gt; and
substitutes variable values referenced in the file content.
If &lt;input&gt; is a relative path it is evaluated with
respect to the current source direc- tory. The &lt;input&gt;
must be a file, not a directory. If &lt;output&gt; is a
relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current
binary directory. If &lt;output&gt; names an existing
directory the input file is placed in that directory with
its original name.</p>

<p>If the &lt;input&gt; file is modified the build system
will re-run CMake to re-configure the file and generate the
build system again.</p>

<p>This command replaces any variables in the input file
referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as
determined by CMake. If a variable is not defined, it will
be replaced with nothing. If COPYONLY is specified, then no
variable expansion will take place. If ESCAPE_QUOTES is
specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style
escaped. The file will be configured with the current values
of CMake variables. If @ONLY is speci- fied, only variables
of the form @VAR@ will be replaced and ${VAR} will be
ignored. This is useful for configuring scripts that use
${VAR}.</p>

<p>Input file lines of the form &quot;#cmakedefine VAR
...&quot; will be replaced with either &quot;#define VAR
...&quot; or &quot;/* #undef VAR */&quot; depending on
whether VAR is set in CMake to any value not con- sidered a
false constant by the if() command. (Content of
&quot;...&quot;, if any, is processed as above.) Input file
lines of the form &quot;#cmakedefine01 VAR&quot; will be
replaced with either &quot;#define VAR 1&quot; or
&quot;#define VAR 0&quot; similarly.</p>

<p>With NEWLINE_STYLE the line ending could be
adjusted:</p>

<p>0 UNIX or LF for 0 DOS, WIN32 or CRLF for</p>

<p>COPYONLY must not be used with NEWLINE_STYLE.</p>

<p>ctest_build Build the project.</p>

<p>ctest_build([BUILD build_dir] [TARGET target]
[RETURN_VALUE res] [APPEND][NUMBER_ERRORS val]
[NUMBER_WARNINGS val])</p>

<p>Builds the given build directory and stores results in
Build.xml. If no BUILD is given, the CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY
variable is used.</p>

<p>The TARGET variable can be used to specify a build
target. If none is specified, the &quot;all&quot; target
will be built.</p>

<p>The RETURN_VALUE option specifies a variable in which to
store the return value of the native build tool. The
NUMBER_ERRORS and NUMBER_WARNINGS options specify variables
in which to store the number of build errors and warnings
detected.</p>

<p>The APPEND option marks results for append to those
previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
ctest_start. Append semantics are defined by the dashboard
server in use.</p>

<p>ctest_configure Configure the project build tree.</p>

<p>ctest_configure([BUILD build_dir] [SOURCE source_dir]
[APPEND] [OPTIONS options] [RETURN_VALUE res])</p>

<p>Configures the given build directory and stores results
in Con- figure.xml. If no BUILD is given, the
CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY variable is used. If no SOURCE is
given, the CTEST_SOURCE_DIREC- TORY variable is used. The
OPTIONS argument specifies command line arguments to pass to
the configuration tool. The RETURN_VALUE option specifies a
variable in which to store the return value of the native
build tool.</p>

<p>The APPEND option marks results for append to those
previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
ctest_start. Append semantics are defined by the dashboard
server in use.</p>

<p>ctest_coverage Collect coverage tool results.</p>

<p>ctest_coverage([BUILD build_dir] [RETURN_VALUE res]
[APPEND] [LABELS label1 [label2 [...]]])</p>

<p>Perform the coverage of the given build directory and
stores results in Coverage.xml. The second argument is a
variable that will hold value.</p>

<p>The LABELS option filters the coverage report to include
only source files labeled with at least one of the labels
specified.</p>

<p>The APPEND option marks results for append to those
previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
ctest_start. Append semantics are defined by the dashboard
server in use.</p>

<p>ctest_empty_binary_directory empties the binary
directory</p>

<p>ctest_empty_binary_directory( directory )</p>

<p>Removes a binary directory. This command will perform
some checks prior to deleting the directory in an attempt to
avoid malicious or accidental directory deletion.</p>

<p>ctest_memcheck Run tests with a dynamic analysis
tool.</p>

<p>ctest_memcheck([BUILD build_dir] [RETURN_VALUE res]
[APPEND] [START start number] [END end number] [STRIDE
stride number] [EXCLUDE exclude regex ] [INCLUDE include
regex] [EXCLUDE_LABEL exclude regex] [INCLUDE_LABEL label
regex] [PARALLEL_LEVEL level] )</p>

<p>Tests the given build directory and stores results in
Mem- Check.xml. The second argument is a variable that will
hold value. Optionally, you can specify the starting test
number START, the ending test number END, the number of
tests to skip between each test STRIDE, a regular expression
for tests to run INCLUDE, or a regular expression for tests
not to run EXCLUDE. EXCLUDE_LABEL and INCLUDE_LABEL are
regular expressions for tests to be included or excluded by
the test property LABEL. PARALLEL_LEVEL should be set to a
positive number representing the number of tests to be run
in parallel.</p>

<p>The APPEND option marks results for append to those
previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
ctest_start. Append semantics are defined by the dashboard
server in use.</p>

<p>ctest_read_custom_files read CTestCustom files.</p>

<p>ctest_read_custom_files( directory ... )</p>

<p>Read all the CTestCustom.ctest or CTestCustom.cmake
files from the given directory.</p>

<p>ctest_run_script runs a ctest -S script</p>

<p>ctest_run_script([NEW_PROCESS] script_file_name
script_file_name1 script_file_name2 ... [RETURN_VALUE
var])</p>

<p>Runs a script or scripts much like if it was run from
ctest -S. If no argument is provided then the current script
is run using the current settings of the variables. If
NEW_PROCESS is speci- fied then each script will be run in a
separate process.If RETURN_VALUE is specified the return
value of the last script run will be put into var.</p>

<p>ctest_sleep sleeps for some amount of time</p>

<p>ctest_sleep(&lt;seconds&gt;)</p>

<p>Sleep for given number of seconds.</p>

<p>ctest_sleep(&lt;time1&gt; &lt;duration&gt;
&lt;time2&gt;)</p>

<p>Sleep for t=(time1 + duration - time2) seconds if t &gt;
0.</p>

<p>ctest_start Starts the testing for a given model</p>

<p>ctest_start(Model [TRACK &lt;track&gt;] [APPEND] [source
[binary]])</p>

<p>Starts the testing for a given model. The command should
be called after the binary directory is initialized. If the
source and binary directory are not specified, it reads the
CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY and CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY. If the
track is specified, the submissions will go to the specified
track. If APPEND is used, the existing TAG is used rather
than creating a new one based on the current time stamp.</p>

<p>ctest_submit Submit results to a dashboard server.</p>

<p>ctest_submit([PARTS ...] [FILES ...] [RETRY_COUNT count]
[RETRY_DELAY delay][RETURN_VALUE res])</p>

<p>By default all available parts are submitted if no PARTS
or FILES are specified. The PARTS option lists a subset of
parts to be submitted. Valid part names are:</p>

<p>Start = nothing Update = ctest_update results, in
Update.xml Configure = ctest_configure results, in
Configure.xml Build = ctest_build results, in Build.xml Test
= ctest_test results, in Test.xml Coverage = ctest_coverage
results, in Coverage.xml MemCheck = ctest_memcheck results,
in DynamicAnalysis.xml Notes = Files listed by
CTEST_NOTES_FILES, in Notes.xml ExtraFiles = Files listed by
CTEST_EXTRA_SUBMIT_FILES Submit = nothing</p>

<p>The FILES option explicitly lists specific files to be
submit- ted. Each individual file must exist at the time of
the call.</p>

<p>The RETRY_DELAY option specifies how long in seconds to
wait after a timed-out submission before attempting to
re-submit.</p>

<p>The RETRY_COUNT option specifies how many times to retry
a timed-out submission.</p>

<p>ctest_test Run tests in the project build tree.</p>

<p>ctest_test([BUILD build_dir] [APPEND] [START start
number] [END end number] [STRIDE stride number] [EXCLUDE
exclude regex ] [INCLUDE include regex] [RETURN_VALUE res]
[EXCLUDE_LABEL exclude regex] [INCLUDE_LABEL label regex]
[PARALLEL_LEVEL level] [SCHEDULE_RANDOM on] [STOP_TIME time
of day])</p>

<p>Tests the given build directory and stores results in
Test.xml. The second argument is a variable that will hold
value. Option- ally, you can specify the starting test
number START, the ending test number END, the number of
tests to skip between each test STRIDE, a regular expression
for tests to run INCLUDE, or a reg- ular expression for
tests to not run EXCLUDE. EXCLUDE_LABEL and INCLUDE_LABEL
are regular expression for test to be included or excluded
by the test property LABEL. PARALLEL_LEVEL should be set to
a positive number representing the number of tests to be run
in parallel. SCHEDULE_RANDOM will launch tests in a random
order, and is typically used to detect implicit test
dependen- cies. STOP_TIME is the time of day at which the
tests should all stop running.</p>

<p>The APPEND option marks results for append to those
previously submitted to a dashboard server since the last
ctest_start. Append semantics are defined by the dashboard
server in use.</p>

<p>ctest_update Update the work tree from version
control.</p>

<p>ctest_update([SOURCE source] [RETURN_VALUE res])</p>

<p>Updates the given source directory and stores results in
Update.xml. If no SOURCE is given, the
CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable is used. The RETURN_VALUE
option specifies a variable in which to store the result,
which is the number of files updated or -1 on error.</p>

<p>ctest_upload Upload files to a dashboard server.</p>

<p>ctest_upload(FILES ...)</p>

<p>Pass a list of files to be sent along with the build
results to the dashboard server.</p>

<p>else Starts the else portion of an if block.</p>

<p>else(expression)</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>elseif Starts the elseif portion of an if block.</p>

<p>endwhile Ends a list of commands in a while block.</p>

<p>endwhile(expression)</p>

<p>See the while command.</p>

<p>exec_program Deprecated. Use the execute_process()
command instead.</p>

<p>Run an executable program during the processing of the
CMake- List.txt file.</p>

<p>exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
[ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;var&gt;] [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])</p>

<p>The executable is run in the optionally specified
directory. The executable can include arguments if it is
double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS
argument to specify argu- ments to the program. This is
because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the
executable path. An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE
specifies a variable in which to store the out- put. To
capture the return value of the execution, provide a
RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no
output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running
cmake.</p>

<p>execute_process Execute one or more child processes.</p>

<p>execute_process(COMMAND &lt;cmd1&gt; [args1...]]
[COMMAND &lt;cmd2&gt; [args2...] [...]] [WORKING_DIRECTORY
&lt;directory&gt;] [TIMEOUT &lt;seconds&gt;]

&lt;variable&gt;] [ERROR_VARIABLE &lt;variable&gt;]
[INPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_FILE &lt;file&gt;]
[ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_QUIET] [ERROR_QUIET]
[OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
[ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])</p>

<p>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the
stan- dard output of each process piped to the standard
input of the next. A single standard error pipe is used for
all processes. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named
directory will be set as the current working directory of
the child processes. If TIME- OUT is given the child
processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed). If
RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain
the result of running the processes. This will be an integer
return code from the last child or a string describing an
error condition. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are
given the variable named will be set with the contents of
the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.
If the same variable is named for both pipes their output
will be merged in the order produced. If INPUT_FILE,
OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be
attached to the stan- dard input of the first process,
standard output of the last process, or standard error of
all processes respectively. If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET
is given then the standard output or standard error results
will be quietly ignored. If more than one OUTPUT_* or
ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is
not specified. If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given
the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of
the CMake process itself.</p>

<p>The execute_process command is a newer more powerful
version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept
for compatibil- ity.</p>

<p>file File manipulation command.</p>

<p>file(WRITE filename &quot;message to write&quot;... )

<p>WRITE will write a message into a file called filename.
It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the
file if it does not exist. (If the file is a build input,
use config- ure_file to update the file only when its
content changes.)</p>

<p>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,
except it will append it to the end of the file</p>

<p>READ will read the content of a file and store it into
the vari- able. It will start at the given offset and read
up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary
data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and
this will be stored in the variable.</p>

<p>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will
compute a cryptographic hash of the content of a file.</p>

<p>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file
and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are
ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It
works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which
are automatically converted to binary format when reading
them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.</p>

<p>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to
return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read
from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of
bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets
the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings
are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a
string to return. Longer strings are split into strings no
longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows
newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating
them.</p>

<p>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must
match to be returned. Typical usage</p>

<p>file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)</p>

<p>stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in
which each item is a line from the input file.</p>

<p>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the
globbing expressions and store it into the variable.
Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but
much simpler. If RELA- TIVE flag is specified for an
expression, the results will be returned as a relative path
to the given path. (We do not rec- ommend using GLOB to
collect a list of source files from your source tree. If no
CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or
removed then the generated build system cannot know when to
ask CMake to regenerate.)</p>

<p>Examples of globbing expressions include:</p>

<p>*.cxx - match all files with extension cxx *.vt? - match
all files with extension vta,...,vtz f[3-5].txt - match
files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt</p>

<p>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular
GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that
are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given
or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake
--help-policy CMP0009 for more information.</p>

<p>Examples of recursive globbing include:</p>

<p>/dir/*.py - match all python files in /dir and
subdirectories</p>

<p>MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also
if their parent directories dont exist yet</p>

<p>RENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem,
replacing the destination atomically.</p>

<p>REMOVE will remove the given files, also in
subdirectories</p>

<p>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and
directories, also non-empty directories</p>

<p>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from
directory to the given file.</p>

<p>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path
with unix /. The input can be a single path or a system path
like &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;. Note the double quotes around
the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes one argument. This
command will also convert the native list delimiters for a
list of paths like the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will
convert from a cmake style path into the native path style
for win- dows and / for UNIX.</p>

<p>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.
If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in
var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation
will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of
length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for
the operation, and the second element is a string value for
the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the
operation. If TIMEOUT time is speci- fied, the operation
will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as
an integer. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer
number of seconds of inactivity after which the opera- tion
should terminate. If EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value is specified,
the operation will verify that the downloaded files actual
hash matches the expected value, where ALGO is one of MD5,
SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512. If it does not
match, the operation fails with an error.
(&quot;EXPECTED_MD5 sum&quot; is short-hand for
&quot;EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum&quot;.) If SHOW_PROGRESS is
specified, progress information will be printed as status
messages until the operation is complete. For https URLs
CMake must be built with OpenSSL. TLS/SSL certificates are
not checked by default. Set TLS_VERIFY to ON to check
certificates and/or use EXPECTED_HASH to verify downloaded
content. Set TLS_CAINFO to specify a custom Certificate
Authority file. If either TLS option is not given CMake will
check variables CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY and CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO,
respectively.</p>

<p>UPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL. If
LOG var is specified a log of the upload will be put in var.
If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will
be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2.
The first element is the numeric return value for the
operation, and the second element is a string value for the
error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If
TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after
time seconds, time should be speci- fied as an integer. The
INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of
inactivity after which the operation should terminate. If
SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be
printed as status messages until the operation is com-
plete.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the
modification time of filename to variable.</p>

<p>Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp
variable will be set to the empty string &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>See documentation of the string TIMESTAMP sub-command
for more details.</p>

<p>The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL
signatures:</p>

<p>file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt; [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
[FILES_MATCHING] [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX
&lt;regex&gt;] [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]]
[...])</p>

<p>The COPY signature copies files, directories, and
symlinks to a destination folder. Relative input paths are
evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and
a relative destina- tion is evaluated with respect to the
current build directory. Copying preserves input file
timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the
destination with the same timestamp. Copying preserves input
permissions unless explicit permissions or
NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PER-
MISSIONS). See the install(DIRECTORY) command for
documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE
options.</p>

<p>The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it
prints sta- tus messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is
default. Installa- tion scripts generated by the install()
command use this signa- ture (with some undocumented options
for internal use).</p>

<p>GENERATE will write an &lt;output_file&gt; with content
from an &lt;input_file&gt;, or from &lt;input_content&gt;.
The output is generated conditionally based on the content
of the &lt;condition&gt;. The file is written at CMake
generate-time and the input may contain gen- erator
expressions. The &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;output_file&gt; and
&lt;input_file&gt; may also contain generator expressions.
The &lt;con- dition&gt; must evaluate to either 0 or 1. The
&lt;output_file&gt; must evaluate to a unique name among all
configurations and among all invocations of
file(GENERATE).</p>

<p>find_file Find the full path to a file.</p>

<p>find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_file( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to named file.
A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the
result of this com- mand. If the full path to a file is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_file is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
loca- tions can be specified after the PATHS argument. If
ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the
environment variable var will be read and converted from a
system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.
For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdirectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>find_library Find a library.</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_library( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[NAMES_PER_DIR] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS
path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2
...]] [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH] [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH | NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a library. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the library is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_library is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the library that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH LIB</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point

NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When more than one value is given to the NAMES option
this com- mand by default will consider one name at a time
and search every directory for it. The NAMES_PER_DIR option
tells this command to consider one directory at a time and
search for all names in it.</p>

<p>If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be
set to the full path to the framework
&lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework
A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the
target.</p>

<p>If the global property FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is
set all search paths will be tested as normal, with
&quot;64/&quot; appended, and with all matches of
&quot;lib/&quot; replaced with &quot;lib64/&quot;. This
property is automatically set for the platforms that are
known to need it if at least one of the languages supported
by the PROJECT com- mand is enabled.</p>

<p>find_package Load settings for an external project.</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[MODULE] [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
[OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Finds and loads settings from an external project.
&lt;pack- age&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the
package was found. When the package is found
package-specific information is provided through variables
and imported targets documented by the package itself. The
QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be
found. The MODULE option disables the second signature
documented below. The REQUIRED option stops process- ing
with an error message if the package cannot be found.</p>

<p>A package-specific list of required components may be
listed after the COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED
option if present). Additional optional components may be
listed after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS. Available components and
their influence on whether a package is considered to be
found are defined by the target package.</p>

<p>The [version] argument requests a version with which the
package found should be compatible (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). The EXACT option requests
that the version be matched exactly. If no [version] and/or
compo- nent list is given to a recursive invocation inside a
find-mod- ule, the corresponding arguments are forwarded
automatically from the outer call (including the EXACT flag
for [version]). Version support is currently provided only
on a package-by-pack- age basis (details below).</p>

<p>User code should generally look for packages using the
above simple signature. The remainder of this command
documentation specifies the full command signature and
details of the search process. Project maintainers wishing
to provide a package to be found by this command are
encouraged to read on.</p>

<p>The command has two modes by which it searches for
packages: &quot;Module&quot; mode and &quot;Config&quot;
mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked
with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file
called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the
file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is
respon- sible for finding the package, checking the version,
and produc- ing any needed messages. Many find-modules
provide limited or no support for versioning; check the
module documentation. If no module is found and the MODULE
option is not given the com- mand proceeds to Config
mode.</p>

<p>The complete Config mode command signature is:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]] [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE] [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]] [CONFIGS config1
[config2 ...]] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]] [PATHS path1
[path2 ... ]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY] [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])</p>

<p>The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode
explicitly and switch to Config mode. It is synonymous to
using NO_MODULE. Config mode is also implied by use of
options not specified in the reduced signature.</p>

<p>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file
provided by the package to be found. A cache entry called
&lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory
containing the file. By default the command searches for a
package with the name &lt;package&gt;. If the NAMES option
is given the names following it are used instead of
&lt;package&gt;. The command searches for a file called
&quot;&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each
name specified. A replacement set of possible configura-
tion file names may be given using the CONFIGS option. The
search procedure is specified below. Once found, the
configura- tion file is read and processed by CMake. Since
the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents. The full path to the
configuration file is stored in the cmake variable
&lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.</p>

<p>All configuration files which have been considered by
CMake while searching for an installation of the package
with an appropriate version are stored in the cmake variable
&lt;pack- age&gt;_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS, the associated
versions in &lt;pack- age&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS.</p>

<p>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake
will generate an error describing the problem unless the
QUIET argu- ment is specified. If REQUIRED is specified and
the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the
configure step stops executing. If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has
been set to a directory not containing a configuration file
CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.</p>

<p>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will
only find a version of the package that claims compatibility
with the requested version (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). If the EXACT option is given
only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the
requested version may be found. CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers. Package
version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files
provided by the packages themselves. For a candidate package
configuration file &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot; the
corresponding ver- sion file is located next to it and named
either &quot;&lt;con- fig-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;. If no such
version file is available then the configuration file is
assumed to not be compatible with any requested version. A
basic version file containing generic version matching code
can be created using the macro
write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation
for more details. When a version file is found it is loaded
to check the requested version number. The version file is
loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables
have been defined:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_FIND_NAME = the &lt;package&gt; name
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION = full requested version string
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested,
else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version
if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak
version if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>The version file checks whether it satisfies the
requested version and sets these variables:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_VERSION = full provided version string
PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT = true if version is exact match
PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any
version</p>

<p>These variables are checked by the find_package command
to determine whether the configuration file provides an
acceptable version. They are not available after the
find_package call returns. If the version is acceptable the
following variables are set:</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_VERSION = full provided version string
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided,
else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK =
tweak version if provided, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version
components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>and the corresponding package configuration file is
loaded. When multiple package configuration files are
available whose version files claim compatibility with the
version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen. No
attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version
number.</p>

<p>Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search
proce- dure. Much of the interface is provided for
completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded
by Module mode. Most user code should simply call</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT]
[REQUIRED|QUIET])</p>

<p>in order to find a package. Package maintainers
providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged
to name and install them such that the procedure outlined
below will find them with- out requiring use of additional
options.</p>

<p>CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes
for the package. Under each prefix several directories are
searched for a configuration file. The tables below show the
directories searched. Each entry is meant for installation
trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A)
conventions.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/ (W) &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/
(U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/
(U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/
(U)</p>

<p>On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application
Bundles the following directories are searched for
frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Resources/CMake/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/
(A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/
(A) &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/ (A)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/
(A)</p>

<p>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as
case-insensitive and cor- responds to any of the names
specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES). Paths
with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set. If PATH_SUFFIXES is
speci- fied the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U)
directory entry one-by-one.</p>

<p>This set of directories is intended to work in
cooperation with projects that provide configuration files
in their installation trees. Directories above marked with
(W) are intended for installations on Windows where the
prefix may point at the top of an applications installation
directory. Those marked with (U) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared
by multiple packages. This is merely a conven- tion, so all
(W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.
Directories marked with (A) are intended for instal- lations
on Apple platforms. The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference
as specified below.</p>

<p>The set of installation prefixes is constructed using
the fol- lowing steps. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all
NO_* options are enabled.</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_DIR CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint provided by the location of another item already found.
Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.
Path entries ending in &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot;
are automatically converted to their parent directories.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search project build trees recently configured in a
CMake GUI. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is
passed. It is intended for the case when a user is building
multiple depen- dent projects one after another.</p>

<p>6. Search paths stored in the CMake user package
registry. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
is passed. On Win- dows a &lt;package&gt; may appear under
registry key</p>

<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USERtwareKitware as a REG_SZ value, with
arbitrary name, that specifies the directory containing the
package configuration file. On UNIX platforms a
&lt;package&gt; may appear under the directory</p>

<p>~/.cmake/packages/&lt;package&gt;</p>

<p>as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies
the directory containing the package configuration file. See
the export(PACKAGE) command to create user package registry
entries for project build trees.</p>

<p>7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>8. Search paths stored in the CMake system package
registry. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed. On Windows a
&lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key</p>

<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEtwareKitware as a REG_SZ value, with
arbitrary name, that specifies the directory containing the
package configuration file. There is no system package
registry on non-Windows platforms.</p>

<p>9. Search paths specified by the PATHS option. These are
typi- cally hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_package(&lt;package&gt;)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled
by set- ting the variable
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the
documentation for the CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;pack-
age&gt; variable for more information.</p>

<p>When loading a find module or package configuration file
find_package defines variables to provide information about
the call arguments (and restores their original state before
return- ing):</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED = true if REQUIRED option
was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY = true if QUIET
option was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION = full
requested version string &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR
= major version if requested, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if requested, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if
requested, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option
was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS = list of
requested components &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;
= true if component &lt;c&gt; is required false if component
&lt;c&gt; is optional</p>

<p>In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to
honor the request detailed by these variables; see the find
module for details. In Config mode find_package handles
REQUIRED, QUIET, and version options automatically but
leaves it to the package configuration file to handle
components in a way that makes sense for the package. The
package configuration file may set &lt;package&gt;_FOUND to
false to tell find_package that component requirements are
not satisfied.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>find_path Find the directory containing a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a directory containing the
named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to
store the result of this command. If the file in a directory
is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV
var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
variable var will be read and converted from a sys- tem
environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For
example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
vari- able. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdi- rectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified
as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for
A.framework/Head- ers/b.h. If that is found the path will be
set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to
the correct -F option to include the file.</p>

<p>find_program Find an executable program.</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_program( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the program is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_program is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the program that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>foreach Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...) COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... endforeach(loop_var)</p>

<p>All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach
are recorded without being invoked. Once the endforeach is
evalu- ated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once
for each argument listed in the original foreach command.
Before each iteration of the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot;
will be set as a variable with the current value in the
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var RANGE total) foreach(loop_var RANGE
start stop [step])</p>

<p>Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of
numbers. There are three types of this iteration:</p>

<p>* When specifying single number, the range will have
elements 0 to &quot;total&quot;.</p>

<p>* When specifying two numbers, the range will have
elements from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>* The third optional number is the increment used to
iterate from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]] [ITEMS [item1
[...]]])</p>

<p>Iterates over a precise list of items. The LISTS option
names list-valued variables to be traversed, including empty
elements (an empty string is a zero-length list). The ITEMS
option ends argument parsing and includes all arguments
following it in the iteration.</p>

<p>function Start recording a function for later invocation
as a command.</p>

<p>function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a function named &lt;name&gt; that takes
arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after
function, but before the matching endfunction, are not
invoked until the function is invoked. When it is invoked,
the commands recorded in the func- tion are first modified
by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to
referencing the formal parameters you can refer- ence the
variable ARGC which will be set to the number of argu- ments
passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...
which will have the actual values of the arguments passed
in. This facilitates creating functions with optional
arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
given to the function and ARGN holds the list of arguments
past the last expected argument.</p>

<p>A function opens a new scope: see set(var PARENT_SCOPE)
for details.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside functions.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property Get a property of the CMake
instance.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property(VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the CMake instance. The value of the
prop- erty is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Some
supported properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES,
COMMANDS, MACROS, and COM- PONENTS.</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_directory_property Get a property of DIRECTORY
scope.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY
&lt;dir&gt;] &lt;prop-name&gt;)</p>

<p>Store a property of directory scope in the named
variable. If the property is not defined the empty-string is
returned. The DIRECTORY argument specifies another directory
from which to retrieve the property value. The specified
directory must have already been traversed by CMake.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY
&lt;dir&gt;] DEFINITION &lt;var-name&gt;)</p>

<p>Get a variable definition from a directory. This form is
useful to get a variable definition from another
directory.</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_filename_component Get a specific component of a
full filename.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; &lt;FileName&gt;
&lt;COMP&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Set &lt;VAR&gt; to a component of &lt;FileName&gt;,
where &lt;COMP&gt; is one of:</p>

<p>DIRECTORY = Directory without file name NAME = File name
without directory EXT = File name longest extension (.b.c
from d/a.b.c) NAME_WE = File name without directory or
longest extension ABSOLUTE = Full path to file REALPATH =
Full path to existing file with symlinks resolved PATH =
Legacy alias for DIRECTORY (use for CMake &lt;= 2.8.11)</p>

<p>Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no
trailing slahes. The longest file extension is always
considered. If the optional CACHE argument is specified, the
result variable is added to the cache.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName PROGRAM
[PROGRAM_ARGS &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;] [CACHE])</p>

<p>The program in FileName will be found in the system
search path or left as a full path. If PROGRAM_ARGS is
present with PRO- GRAM, then any command-line arguments
present in the FileName string are split from the program
name and stored in &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;. This is used to separate
a program name from its arguments in a command line
string.</p>

<p>get_property Get a property.</p>

<p>get_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY
[dir] | TARGET &lt;target&gt; | SOURCE &lt;source&gt; | TEST
&lt;test&gt; | CACHE &lt;entry&gt; | VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY
&lt;name&gt; [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])</p>

<p>Get one property from one object in a scope. The first
argument specifies the variable in which to store the
result. The second argument determines the scope from which
to get the property. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope must name one existing target.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope must name one source file.</p>

<p>TEST scope must name one existing test.</p>

<p>CACHE scope must name one cache entry.</p>

<p>VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to get. If the property is not set
an empty value is returned. If the SET option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been set. If the DEFINED option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been defined such as with define_property. If
BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to
a string containing documenta- tion for the requested
property. If documentation is requested for a property that
has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.</p>

<p>if Conditionally execute a group of commands.</p>

<p>if(expression) # then section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... elseif(expression2) # elseif section.
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... else(expression) #
else section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endif(expression)</p>

<p>Evaluates the given expression. If the result is true,
the com- mands in the THEN section are invoked. Otherwise,
the commands in the else section are invoked. The elseif and
else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif
clauses. Note that the expression in the else and endif
clause is optional. Long expressions can be used and there
is a traditional order of precedence. Parenthetical
expressions are evaluated first fol- lowed by unary
operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED. Then any
EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES
will be evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR
operators will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:</p>

<p>if(&lt;constant&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a
non-zero num- ber. False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO,
FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, , or ends in the suffix
-NOTFOUND . Named boolean constants are case-insensitive. If
the argument is not one of these constants, it is treated as
a variable:</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the variable is defined to a value that is not a
false constant. False otherwise. (Note macro arguments are
not vari- ables.)</p>

<p>if(NOT &lt;expression&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the expression is not true.</p>

<p>if(&lt;expr1&gt; AND &lt;expr2&gt;)</p>

<p>True if both expressions would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(&lt;expr1&gt; OR &lt;expr2&gt;)</p>

<p>True if either expression would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(COMMAND command-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a command, macro or function
that can be invoked.</p>

<p>if(POLICY policy-id)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing policy (of the
form CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).</p>

<p>if(TARGET target-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing target, built or
imported.</p>

<p>if(EXISTS file-name) if(EXISTS directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the named file or directory exists. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)</p>

<p>True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two
files doesn t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full
paths. If the file time stamps are exactly the same, an
IS_NEWER_THAN com- parison returns true, so that any
dependent build operations will occur in the event of a tie.
This includes the case of passing the same file name for
both file1 and file2.</p>

<p>if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a directory. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a symbolic link. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)</p>

<p>True if the given path is an absolute path.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; MATCHES regex)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value matches the
given regular expression.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; EQUAL
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is a valid
number and the inequality or equality is true.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRLESS
&lt;variable|string&gt;) if(&lt;variable|string&gt;
STRGREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STREQUAL
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is
lexicographi- cally less (or greater, or equal) than the
string or variable on the right.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_LESS
&lt;variable|string&gt;) if(&lt;variable|string&gt;
VERSION_EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_GREATER
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>Component-wise integer version number comparison
(version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).</p>

<p>if(DEFINED &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given variable is defined. It does not
matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been
set.</p>

<p>if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))</p>

<p>The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated
first and then the remaining expression is evaluated as in
the previous examples. Where there are nested parenthesis
the innermost are evaluated as part of evaluating the
expression that contains them.</p>

<p>The if command was written very early in CMake s
history, pre- dating the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and
for convenience evaluates variables named by its arguments
as shown in the above signatures. Note that normal variable
evaluation with ${} applies before the if command even
receives the arguments. Therefore code like</p>

<p>set(var1 OFF) set(var2 &quot;var1&quot;) if(${var2})</p>

<p>appears to the if command as</p>

<p>if(var1)</p>

<p>and is evaluated according to the if(&lt;variable&gt;)
case documented above. The result is OFF which is false.
However, if we remove the ${} from the example then the
command sees</p>

<p>if(var2)</p>

<p>which is true because var2 is defined to
&quot;var1&quot; which is not a false constant.</p>

<p>Automatic evaluation applies in the other cases whenever
the above-documented signature accepts
&lt;variable|string&gt;:</p>

<p>1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to
see if it is a defined variable, if so the variables value
is used, otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>2) If the left hand argument to MATCHES is missing it
returns false without error</p>

<p>3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER
EQUAL are independently tested to see if they are defined
variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the
original value is used.</p>

<p>4) Both left and right hand arguments to STRLESS
STREQUAL STR- GREATER are independently tested to see if
they are defined variables, if so their defined values are
used otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>5) Both left and right hand argumemnts to VERSION_LESS
VER- SION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to
see if they are defined variables, if so their defined
values are used otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to see if it
is a boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it
is assumed to be a variable and it is dereferenced.</p>

<p>7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR are
independently tested to see if they are boolean constants,
if so they are used as such, otherwise they are assumed to
be variables and are dereferenced.</p>

<p>include Load and run CMake code from a file or
module.</p>

<p>include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE
&lt;VAR&gt;] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Load and run CMake code from the file given. Variable
reads and writes access the scope of the caller (dynamic
scoping). If OPTIONAL is present, then no error is raised if
the file does not exist. If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the
variable will be set to the full filename which has been
included or NOTFOUND if it failed.</p>

<p>If a module is specified instead of a file, the file
with name &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched first in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in the CMake module directory. There
is one exception to this: if the file which calls include()
is located itself in the CMake module directory, then first
the CMake module directory is searched and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
afterwards. See also policy CMP0017.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>list List operations.</p>

<p>list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element
index&gt; ...] &lt;output variable&gt;) list(APPEND
&lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt;
&lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...]) list(REMOVE_ITEM
&lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt;
...]) list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;) list(REVERSE
&lt;list&gt;) list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given lists length.</p>

<p>GET will return list of elements specified by indices
from the list.</p>

<p>APPEND will append elements to the list.</p>

<p>FIND will return the index of the element specified in
the list or -1 if it wasnt found.</p>

<p>INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified
loca- tion.</p>

<p>REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the
list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the
given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the
given indices.</p>

<p>REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the
list.</p>

<p>REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.</p>

<p>SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.</p>

<p>The list subcommands APPEND, INSERT, REMOVE_AT,
REMOVE_ITEM, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create
new values for the list within the current CMake variable
scope. Similar to the SET command, the LIST command creates
new variable values in the current scope, even if the list
itself is actually defined in a parent scope. To propagate
the results of these operations upwards, use SET with
PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other means
of value propagation.</p>

<p>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of
strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For
example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list with a;b;c;d;e,
and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) creates a string or a
list with one item in it.</p>

<p>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt;
is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the
list, with 0 representing the first list element. If
&lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from
the end of the list, with -1 repre- senting the last list
element. Be careful when counting with negative indices:
they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first
list element.</p>

<p>macro Start recording a macro for later invocation as a
command.</p>

<p>macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments
named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after macro, but
before the match- ing endmacro, are not invoked until the
macro is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded
in the macro are first mod- ified by replacing formal
parameters (${arg1}) with the argu- ments passed, and then
invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the
formal parameters you can reference the val- ues ${ARGC}
which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the
function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This
facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Addi-
tionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to
the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of arguments past the
last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro
and val- ues such as ARGN are not variables in the usual
CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the C
preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake
variables and/or better CMake scope control you should look
at the function command.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside macros.</p>

<p>make_directory Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY )
command instead.</p>

<p>make_directory(directory)</p>

<p>Creates the specified directory. Full paths should be
given. Any parent directories that do not exist will also be
created. Use with care.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced Mark cmake cached variables as
advanced.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)</p>

<p>Mark the named cached variables as advanced. An advanced
vari- able will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs
unless the show advanced option is on. If CLEAR is the first
argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made
advanced. If nei- ther FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new
values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable
already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
changed.</p>

<p>It does nothing in script mode.</p>

<p>math Mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math
expression&gt;)</p>

<p>EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and returns
result in the output variable. Example mathematical
expression is 5 * ( 10 + 13 ). Supported operators are + - *
/ % | &amp; ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %. They have the same
meaning as they do in C code.</p>

<p>message Display a message to the user.</p>


<p>message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
&quot;message to display&quot; ...)</p>

<p>The optional keyword determines the type of message:</p>

<p>(none) = Important information STATUS = Incidental
information WARNING = CMake Warning, continue processing
AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
SEND_ERROR = CMake Error, continue processing, but skip
generation FATAL_ERROR = CMake Error, stop processing and
generation</p>

<p>The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on
stdout and all other message types on stderr. The CMake GUI
displays all messages in its log area. The interactive
dialogs (ccmake and CMakeSetup) show STATUS messages one at
a time on a status line and other messages in interactive
pop-up boxes.</p>

<p>CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a
simple markup language. Non-indented text is formatted in
line-wrapped paragraphs delimited by newlines. Indented text
is considered pre-formatted.</p>

<p>option Provides an option that the user can optionally
select.</p>

<p>option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string
describing option&quot; [initial value])</p>

<p>Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.
If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.</p>

<p>If you have options that depend on the values of other
options, see the module help for CMakeDependentOption.</p>

<p>remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command
instead.</p>

<p>remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)</p>

<p>Removes VALUE from the variable VAR. This is typically
used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon
separated list). VALUE is expanded.</p>

<p>return Return from a file, directory or function.</p>

<p>return()</p>

<p>Returns from a file, directory or function. When this
command is encountered in an included file (via include() or
find_pack- age()), it causes processing of the current file
to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it
is encountered in a file which is not included by another
file, e.g. a CMake- Lists.txt, control is returned to the
parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a
function, control is returned to the caller of the function.
Note that a macro is not a func- tion and does not handle
return like a function does.</p>

<p>separate_arguments Parse space-separated arguments into
a semicolon-separated list.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(&lt;var&gt;
&lt;UNIX|WINDOWS&gt;_COMMAND &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;)</p>

<p>Parses a unix- or windows-style command-line string
&quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; and stores a semicolon-separated
list of the arguments in &lt;var&gt;. The entire command
line must be given in one &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;
argument.</p>

<p>The UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted
whites- pace. It recognizes both single-quote and
double-quote pairs. A backslash escapes the next literal
character ( are no special escapes (is just n).</p>

<p>The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line
using the same syntax the runtime library uses to construct
argv at startup. It separates arguments by whitespace that
is not dou- ble-quoted. Backslashes are literal unless they
precede dou- ble-quotes. See the MSDN article &quot;Parsing
C Command-Line Arguments&quot; for details.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(VARIABLE)</p>

<p>Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated
list. All spaces are replaced with ;. This helps with
generating command lines.</p>

<p>set Set a CMake, cache or environment variable to a
given value.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt; [[CACHE &lt;type&gt;
&lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the value
&lt;value&gt;. &lt;value&gt; is expanded before
&lt;variable&gt; is set to it. Normally, set will set a
regular CMake variable. If CACHE is present, then the
&lt;vari- able&gt; is put in the cache instead, unless it is
already in the cache. See section Variable types in CMake
below for details of regular and cache variables and their
interactions. If CACHE is used, &lt;type&gt; and
&lt;docstring&gt; are required. &lt;type&gt; is used by the
CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a
value. The value for &lt;type&gt; may be one of</p>

<p>FILEPATH = File chooser dialog. PATH = Directory chooser
dialog. STRING = Arbitrary string. BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF
checkbox. INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent
variables).</p>

<p>If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, the cache variable is
marked as internal, and will not be shown to the user in
tools like cmake-gui. This is intended for values that
should be persisted in the cache, but which users should not
normally change. INTERNAL implies FORCE.</p>

<p>Normally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but
does not modify them. If FORCE is specified, the value of
the cache vari- able is set, even if the variable is already
in the cache. This should normally be avoided, as it will
remove any changes to the cache variables value by the
user.</p>

<p>If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or
function creates a new scope. This command will set the
value of a vari- able into the parent directory or calling
function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand).
PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.</p>

<p>If &lt;value&gt; is not specified then the variable is
removed instead of set. See also: the unset() command.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ...
&lt;valueN&gt;)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon
separated list of values.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )</p>

<p>in which case the environment variable will be set.</p>

<p>*** Variable types in CMake ***</p>

<p>In CMake there are two types of variables: normal
variables and cache variables. Normal variables are meant
for the internal use of the script (just like variables in
most programming lan- guages); they are not persisted across
CMake runs. Cache vari- ables (unless set with INTERNAL) are
mostly intended for config- uration settings where the first
CMake run determines a suitable default value, which the
user can then override, by editing the cache with tools such
as ccmake or cmake-gui. Cache variables are stored in the
CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs.</p>

<p>Both types can exist at the same time with the same name
but different values. When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first
looks for a normal variable FOO in scope and uses it if set.
If and only if no normal variable exists then it falls back
to the cache variable FOO.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>The code set(FOO &quot;x&quot;) sets the normal variable
FOO. It does not touch the cache, but it will hide any
existing cache value FOO.</p>

<p>The code set(FOO &quot;x&quot; CACHE ...) checks for FOO
in the cache, ignoring any normal variable of the same name.
If FOO is in the cache then nothing happens to either the
normal variable or the cache variable. If FOO is not in the
cache, then it is added to the cache.</p>

<p>Finally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified
by a command, CMake also *removes* the normal variable of
the same name from the current scope so that an immediately
following evaluation of it will expose the newly cached
value.</p>

<p>Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache
variables of the same name, as this interaction can be hard
to follow. However, in some situations it can be useful. One
example (used by some projects):</p>

<p>A project has a subproject in its source tree. The child
project has its own CMakeLists.txt, which is included from
the parent CMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory(). Now, if
the parent and the child project provide the same option
(for example a com- piler option), the parent gets the first
chance to add a user-editable option to the cache. Normally,
the child would then use the same value that the parent
uses. However, it may be necessary to hard-code the value
for the child projects option while still allowing the user
to edit the value used by the par- ent project. The parent
project can achieve this simply by set- ting a normal
variable with the same name as the option in a scope
sufficient to hide the option s cache variable from the
child completely. The parent has already set the cache
variable, so the childs set(...CACHE...) will do nothing,
and evaluating the option variable will use the value from
the normal variable, which hides the cache variable.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties Set a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2
value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the current directory and
subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will
report an error. The prop- erties include:
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.
ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be
cleaned as a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>set_property Set a named property in a given scope.</p>

<p>set_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY [dir] | TARGET
[target1 [target2 ...]] | SOURCE [src1 [src2 ...]] | TEST
[test1 [test2 ...]] | CACHE [entry1 [entry2 ...]]&gt;
[APPEND] [APPEND_STRING] PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [value1
[value2 ...]])</p>

<p>Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope. The
first argument determines the scope in which the property is
set. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files. Note
that source file properties are visible only to targets
added in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt).</p>

<p>TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.</p>

<p>CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing
entries.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to set. Remaining arguments are
used to compose the property value in the form of a
semicolon-separated list. If the APPEND option is given the
list is appended to any exist- ing property value.If the
APPEND_STRING option is given the string is append to any
existing property value as string, i.e. it results in a
longer string and not a list of strings.</p>

<p>site_name Set the given variable to the name of the
computer.</p>

<p>site_name(variable)</p>

<p>string String operations.</p>

<p>string(REGEX MATCH &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX
MATCHALL &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;
&lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...]) string(REGEX REPLACE
&lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;replace_expression&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(REPLACE &lt;match_string&gt; &lt;replace_string&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt; [&lt;input&gt;...])
string(&lt;MD5|SHA1|SHA224|SHA256|SHA384|SHA512&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt; &lt;input&gt;) string(COMPARE EQUAL
&lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL &lt;string1&gt; &lt;string2&gt;
&lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE LESS &lt;string1&gt;
&lt;string2&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(COMPARE

&lt;string1&gt; &lt;output variable&gt; [@ONLY]
[ESCAPE_QUOTES]) string(TOUPPER &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(TOLOWER &lt;string1&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(LENGTH &lt;string&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) string(SUBSTRING &lt;string&gt; &lt;begin&gt;
&lt;length&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(STRIP
&lt;string&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;) string(RANDOM
[LENGTH &lt;length&gt;] [ALPHABET &lt;alphabet&gt;]
[RANDOM_SEED &lt;seed&gt;] &lt;output variable&gt;)
string(FIND &lt;string&gt; &lt;substring&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt; [REVERSE]) string(TIMESTAMP &lt;output
variable&gt; [&lt;format string&gt;] [UTC])
string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER &lt;input string&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;)</p>

<p>REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and
store the match in the output variable.</p>

<p>REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and store the matches in the output
variable as a list.</p>

<p>REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and substitute the replacement expression
for the match in the output. The replace expression may
refer to paren-delim- ited subexpressions of the match using
1, 2, ..., 9. Note that two backslashes (\1) are required in
CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.</p>

<p>REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in
the input with replace_string and store the result in the
output.</p>

<p>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will
compute a cryptographic hash of the input string.</p>

<p>COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the
strings and store true or false in the output variable.</p>

<p>ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII
charac- ters.</p>

<p>CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE
transforms a file.</p>

<p>TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower
characters.</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given strings length.</p>

<p>SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string. If
length is -1 the remainder of the string starting at begin
will be returned.</p>

<p>STRIP will return a substring of a given string with
leading and trailing spaces removed.</p>

<p>RANDOM will return a random string of given length
consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default
length is 5 charac- ters and default alphabet is all numbers
and upper and lower case letters. If an integer RANDOM_SEED
is given, its value will be used to seed the random number
generator.</p>

<p>FIND will return the position where the given substring
was found in the supplied string. If the REVERSE flag was
used, the command will search for the position of the last
occurrence of the specified substring.</p>

<p>The following characters have special meaning in regular
expressions:</p>

<p>^ Matches at beginning of input $ Matches at end of
input . Matches any single character [ ] Matches any
character(s) inside the brackets [^ ] Matches any
character(s) not inside the brackets - Inside brackets,
specifies an inclusive range between characters on either
side e.g. [a-f] is [abcdef] To match a literal - using
brackets, make it the first or the last character e.g.
[+*/-] matches basic mathematical operators. * Matches
preceding pattern zero or more times + Matches preceding
pattern one or more times ? Matches preceding pattern zero
or once only | Matches a pattern on either side of the | ()
Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced in
the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved by all
regular expression-related commands, including e.g. if(
MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).</p>

<p>*, + and ? have higher precedence than concatenation. |
has lower precedence than concatenation. This means that the
regular expression &quot;^ab+d$&quot; matches
&quot;abbd&quot; but not &quot;ababd&quot;, and the reg-
ular expression &quot;^(ab|cd)$&quot; matches &quot;ab&quot;
but not &quot;abd&quot;.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the
current date and/or time to the output variable.</p>

<p>Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp the
output variable will be set to the empty string
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>The optional UTC flag requests the current date/time
representa- tion to be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
rather than local time.</p>

<p>The optional &lt;format string&gt; may contain the
following format specifiers:</p>

<p>%d The day of the current month (01-31). %H The hour on
a 24-hour clock (00-23). %I The hour on a 12-hour clock
(01-12). %j The day of the current year (001-366). %m The
month of the current year (01-12). %M The minute of the
current hour (00-59). %S The second of the current minute.
60 represents a leap second. (00-60) %U The week number of
the current year (00-53). %w The day of the current week. 0
is Sunday. (0-6) %y The last two digits of the current year
(00-99) %Y The current year.</p>

<p>Unknown format specifiers will be ignored and copied to
the out- put as-is.</p>

<p>If no explicit &lt;format string&gt; is given it will
default to:</p>

<p>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S for local time. %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ for
UTC.</p>

<p>MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER will write a string which can be used
as an identifier in C.</p>

<p>unset Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment
variable.</p>

<p>unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Removes the specified variable causing it to become
undefined. If CACHE is present then the variable is removed
from the cache instead of the current scope.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})</p>

<p>in which case the variable will be removed from the
current environment.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa Copy mesa headers for use in
combination with system GL.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)</p>

<p>The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.
The mesa headers are copied to the specified output
directory. This allows mangled mesa headers to override
other GL headers by being added to the include directory
path earlier.</p>

<p>variable_watch Watch the CMake variable for change.</p>

<p>variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to
execute&gt;])</p>

<p>If the specified variable changes, the message will be
printed about the variable being changed. If the command is
specified, the command will be executed. The command will
receive the fol- lowing arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
&lt;stack&gt;)</p>

<p>while Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is
true</p>

<p>while(condition) COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
... endwhile(condition)</p>

<p>All commands between while and the matching endwhile are
recorded without being invoked. Once the endwhile is
evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long
as the condi- tion is true. The condition is evaluated using
the same logic as the if command.</p>

<p>write_file Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command
instead.</p>

<p>write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;...
[APPEND])</p>

<p>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the
arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is
specified, then the message will be appended.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot
be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file
...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use
configure_file if you want to generate input files to
CMake.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES CMake Properties - Properties supported by
CMake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the properties supported
by CMake. Prop- erties can have different scopes. They can
either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target
or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties
the behaviour of the build system can be cus- tomized.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS CMake Compatibility Listfile
Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for
compatibility.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile
commands from pre- vious CMake versions, which are still
supported for compatibility rea- sons. You should instead
use the newer, faster and shinier new com- mands. ;-)</p>
