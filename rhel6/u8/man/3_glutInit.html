<p>NAME glutInit - Initialize OpenGLUT data structures.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - mainloop</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutInit(int *pargc, char **argv);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS pargc Pointer to something like main()s
argc.</p>

<p>argv Something like main()s argv.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function should be called once, near
the start of any GLUT, freeg- lut, or OpenGLUT program. It
serves two vital roles:</p>

<p>- It allows OpenGLUT to initialize internal structures.
- It allows OpenGLUT to process command-line arguments to
control the initial window position, etc.</p>

<p>You should take note of the interaction between
glutInit() and the related functions such as
glutInitWindowPosition(). OpenGLUT always uses the most
recent configuration information, so if you call glutInit(),
then glutInitWindowPosition(), you prevent the user from
controlling the initial window position via a command-line
parameter.</p>

<p>glutInit() will remove from pargc, argv any parameters
that it recog- nizes in the command line. The following
command-line parameters are suported:</p>

<p>- -display display-id This allows connection to an
alternate X server. - -geometry geometry-spec This takes
width, height, and window posi- tion. The position is given
as a signed value (negative values being distance from the
far boundary of the screen). For example, a window geometry
of 5x7+11-17 is 5 pixels wide, 7 pixels tall, 11 pixels from
the left, and 17 pixels from the bottom edge of the screen.
- -direct Insist on only OpenGL direct rendering. Direct
rendering is normally requested but indirect is normally
accepted. -direct is not always available. See -indirect. -
-indirect Attempt only indirect OpenGL rendering. -indirect
is always available. See -direct. - -iconic Open the window
in iconized form. - -gldebug Print any detected OpenGL
errors via glutReportErrors(). Presently done at the bottom
of glutMainLoopEvent(). - -sync Synchronize the window
system communications heavily.</p>

<p>Additionally, this function checks whether the
environment variable GLUT_FPS is defined (only on UNIX_X11);
if so, OpenGLUT will periodi- cally print the average number
of times per second that your program calls
glutSwapBuffers().</p>

<p>CAVEATS You really should always call this, even if you
are a WIN32 user. It provides a way for the user to directly
inform OpenGLUT about preferences without the application
needing to explicitly deal with those issues. This is also
where OpenGLUT retrieves your programs name to help disam-
biguate error and warning messages it may be forced to
emit.</p>

<p>Option -sync sets a flag, but is not actually used at
this time.</p>

<p>Lots of code does XFlush() on the X server, regardless
of whether -sync is specified. Much of that appears to be
required in order to support direct client invocation of
glutMainLoopEvent(), regrettably. However, if one calls
glutMainLoop(), instead, we might avoid gratuitous XFlush()
calls. (That last sentence isnt particularly germain to this
function, but theres no better place to make this remark at
this time.) Even for glutMainLoopEvent(), we may be able to
coalesce many XFlush() calls.</p>
