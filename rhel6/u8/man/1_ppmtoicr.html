<p>NAME ppmtoicr - convert a PPM image into NCSA ICR
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoicr</p>

<p>[-windowname name]</p>

<p>[-expand expand]</p>

<p>[-display display]</p>

<p>[-rle]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtoicr reads a PPM file as input. Produces an NCSA
Telnet Interac- tive Color Raster graphic file as
output.</p>

<p>If ppmfile is not supplied, ppmtoicr reads from Standard
Input.</p>

<p>Interactive Color Raster (ICR) is a protocol for
displaying raster graphics on workstation screens. The
protocol is implemented in NCSA Telnet for the Macintosh
version 2.3. The ICR protocol shares charac- teristics of
the Tektronix graphics terminal emulation protocol. For
example, escape sequences are used to control the
display.</p>

<p>ppmtoicr will output the appropriate sequences to create
a window of the dimensions of the input image, create a
colormap of up to 256 col- ors on the display, then load the
picture data into the window.</p>

<p>Note that there is no icrtoppm tool - this
transformation is one way.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -windowname name Output will be displayed in
name (Default is to use ppmfile or untitled if the input is
from Standard Input).</p>

<p>-expand expand Output will be expanded on display by
factor expand (For exam- ple, a value of 2 will cause four
pixels to be displayed for every input pixel.)</p>

<p>-display display Output will be displayed on screen
numbered display</p>

<p>-rle Use run-length encoded format for display. (This
will nearly always result in a quicker display, but may skew
the colormap).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To display a PPM file named ppmfile using the
protocol:</p>

<p>ppmtoicr ppmfile</p>

<p>This will create a window named ppmfile on the display
with the correct dimensions for ppmfile, create and download
a colormap of up to 256 colors, and download the picture
into the window. You may achieve the same effect with the
following sequence:</p>

<p>ppmtoicr ppmfile &gt; filename cat filename</p>

<p>To display a GIF file using the protocol in a window
titled after the input file, zoom the displayed image by a
factor of 2, and run-length encode the data:</p>

<p>giftopnm giffile | ppmtoicr -w giffile -r -e 2</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The protocol uses frequent fflush() calls to
speed up display. If you save the output to a file for later
display via cat, ppmtoicr will draw much more slowly. In
either case, increasing the blocksize limit on the display
will speed up transmission substantially.</p>
