LVM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pvcreate [--commandprofile ProfileName]
[-d|--debug] [-h|--help] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose]
[--version] [-f[f]|--force [--force]] [-y|--yes]
[--labelsector] [--bootloaderareasize size] [-M|--meta-
datatype type] [--[pv]metadatacopies NumberOfCopies]
[--metadatasize size] [--metadataignore {y|n}]
[--dataalignment alignment] [--dataalignmentoffset
alignment_offset] [--restorefile file] [--nore- storefile]
[--setphysicalvolumesize size] [-u|--uuid uuid] [-Z|--zero
{y|n}] PhysicalVolume [PhysicalVolume...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pvcreate initializes PhysicalVolume for
later use by the Logical Volume Manager (LVM). Each
PhysicalVolume can be a disk partition, whole disk, meta
device, or loopback file. For DOS disk partitions, the par-
tition id should be set to 0x8e using fdisk(8), cfdisk(8),
or a equiva- lent. For GUID Partition Table (GPT), the id is
E6D6D379-F507-44C2-A23C-238F2A3DF928. For whole disk devices
only the partition table must be erased, which will
effectively destroy all data on that disk. This can be done
by zeroing the first sector with:</p>

<p>dd if=/dev/zero of=PhysicalVolume bs=512 count=1</p>

<p>Continue with vgcreate(8) to create a new volume group
on PhysicalVol- ume, or vgextend(8) to add PhysicalVolume to
an existing volume group.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force the creation without any confirmation.
You can not recre- ate (reinitialize) a physical volume
belonging to an existing volume group. In an emergency you
can override this behaviour with -ff.</p>

<p>-u, --uuid uuid Specify the uuid for the device. Without
this option, pvcre- ate(8) generates a random uuid. All of
your physical volumes must have unique uuids. You need to
use this option before restoring a backup of LVM metadata
onto a replacement device - see vgcfgrestore(8). As such,
use of --restorefile is compul- sory unless the
--norestorefile is used.</p>

<p>-y, --yes Answer yes to all questions.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero {y|n} Whether or not the first 4 sectors
(2048 bytes) of the device should be wiped. If this option
is not given, the default is to wipe these sectors unless
either or both of the --restorefile or --uuid options were
specified.</p>

<p>NEW METADATA OPTIONS LVM2 introduces a new format for
storing metadata on disk. This new format is more efficient
and resilient than the format the original version of LVM
used and offers the advanced user greater flexibility and
control.</p>

<p>The new format may be selected on the command line with
-M2 or by set- ting format = &quot;lvm2&quot; in the global
section of lvm.conf(5). Each physical volume in the same
volume group must use the same format, but different volume
groups on a machine may use different formats simulta-
neously: the tools can handle both formats. Additional
formats can be added as shared libraries.</p>

<p>Additional tools for manipulating the locations and
sizes of metadata areas will be written in due course. Use
the verbose/debug options on the tools to see where the
metadata areas are placed.</p>

<p>--metadatasize size The approximate amount of space to
be set aside for each meta- data area. (The size you specify
may get rounded.)</p>

<p>--dataalignment alignment Align the start of the data to
a multiple of this number. You should also specify an
appropriate PhysicalExtentSize when cre- ating the Volume
Group with vgcreate.</p>

<p>To see the location of the first Physical Extent of an
existing Physical Volume use pvs -o +pe_start . It will be a
multiple of the requested alignment. In addition it may be
shifted by alignment_offset from
data_alignment_offset_detection (if enabled in lvm.conf(5))
or --dataalignmentoffset.</p>

<p>--dataalignmentoffset alignment_offset Shift the start
of the data area by this additional align- ment_offset.</p>

<p>--[pv]metadatacopies NumberOfCopies The number of
metadata areas to set aside on each PV. Currently this can
be 0, 1 or 2. If set to 2, two copies of the volume group
metadata are held on the PV, one at the front of the PV and
one at the end. If set to 1 (the default), one copy is kept
at the front of the PV (starting in the 5th sector). If set
to 0, no copies are kept on this PV - you might wish to use
this with VGs containing large numbers of PVs. But if you do
this and then later use vgsplit(8) you must ensure that each
VG is still going to have a suitable number of copies of the
metadata after the split!</p>

<p>--metadataignore {y|n} Ignore or un-ignore metadata
areas on this physical volume. The default is &quot;n&quot;.
This setting can be changed with pvchange. If metadata areas
on a physical volume are ignored, LVM will not store
metadata in the metadata areas present on this Physical
Volume. Metadata areas cannot be created or extended after
Log- ical Volumes have been allocated on the device. If you
do not want to store metadata on this device, it is still
wise always to allocate a metadata area in case you need it
in the future and to use this option to instruct LVM2 to
ignore it.</p>

<p>--restorefile file In conjunction with --uuid, this
extracts the location and size of the data on the PV from
the file (produced by vgcfgbackup) and ensures that the
metadata that the program produces is con- sistent with the
contents of the file i.e. the physical extents will be in
the same place and not get overwritten by new meta- data.
This provides a mechanism to upgrade the metadata format or
to add/remove metadata areas. Use with care. See also vgcon-
vert(8).</p>

<p>--norestorefile In conjunction with --uuid, this allows
a uuid to be specified without also requiring that a backup
of the metadata be pro- vided.</p>

<p>--labelsector sector By default the PV is labelled with
an LVM2 identifier in its second sector (sector 1). This
lets you use a different sector near the start of the disk
(between 0 and 3 inclusive - see LABEL_SCAN_SECTORS in the
source). Use with care.</p>

<p>--bootloaderareasize size Create a separate bootloader
area of specified size besides PVs data area. The bootloader
area is an area of reserved space on the PV from which LVM2
will not allocate any extents and its kept untouched. This
is primarily aimed for use with bootloaders to embed their
own data or metadata. The start of the boot- loader area is
always aligned, see also --dataalignment and
--dataalignmentoffset. The bootloader area size may
eventually end up increased due to the alignment, but its
never less than the size that is requested. To see the
bootloader area start and size of an existing Physical
Volume use pvs -o +pv_ba_start,pv_ba_size.</p>

<p>--setphysicalvolumesize size Overrides the
automatically-detected size of the PV. Use with care.</p>

<p>Examples Initialize partition #4 on the third SCSI disk
and the entire fifth SCSI disk for later use by LVM:</p>

<p>pvcreate /dev/sdc4 /dev/sde</p>

<p>If the 2nd SCSI disk is a 4KiB sector drive that
compensates for win- dows partitioning (sector 7 is the
lowest aligned logical block, the 4KiB sectors start at LBA
-1, and consequently sector 63 is aligned on a 4KiB
boundary) manually account for this when initializing for
use by LVM:</p>

<p>pvcreate --dataalignmentoffset 7s /dev/sdb</p>
