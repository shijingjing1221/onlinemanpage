<p>ACL_EXTENDED_FD(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_EXTENDED_FD(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_extended_fd - test for information in the ACL
by file descriptor</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;acl/libacl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acl_extended_fd(int fd);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_extended_fd() function returns 1 if
the file identified by the argument fd is associated with an
extended access ACL. The function returns 0 if the file does
not have an extended access ACL.</p>

<p>An extended ACL is an ACL that contains entries other
than the three required entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ,
ACL_GROUP_OBJ and ACL_OTHER. If the result of the
acl_extended_fd() function for a file object is 0, then the
ACL defines no discretionary access rights other than those
already defined by the traditional file permission bits.</p>

<p>Access to the file object may be further restricted by
other mechanisms, such as Mandatory Access Control schemes.
The access(2) system call can be used to check whether a
given type of access to a file object would be granted.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the acl_extended_fd()
function returns 1 if the file object identified by fd has
an extended access ACL, and 0 if the file object identified
by fd does not have an extended access ACL. Otherwise, the
value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_extended_fd() function returns -1 and sets errno to the
corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EBADF] The fd argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] The file system on which the file identified
by fd is located does not support ACLs, or ACLs are
disabled.</p>

<p>STANDARDS This is a non-portable, Linux specific
extension to the ACL manipulation functions defined in IEEE
Std 1003.1e draft 17 ( POSIX.1e , abandoned).</p>
