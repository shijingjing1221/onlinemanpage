<p>NAME sssd-sudo - Configuring sudo with the SSSD back
end</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes how to configure
sudo(8) to work with sssd(8) and how SSSD caches sudo
rules.</p>

<p>CONFIGURING SUDO TO COOPERATE WITH SSSD To enable SSSD
as a source for sudo rules, add sss to the sudoers entry in
nsswitch.conf(5).</p>

<p>For example, to configure sudo to first lookup rules in
the standard sudoers(5) file (which should contain rules
that apply to local users) and then in SSSD, the
nsswitch.conf file should contain the following line:</p>

<p>sudoers: files sss</p>

<p>More information about configuring the sudoers search
order from the nsswitch.conf file as well as information
about the LDAP schema that is used to store sudo rules in
the directory can be found in sudoers.ldap(5).</p>

<p>Note: in order to use netgroups or IPA hostgroups in
sudo rules, you also need to correctly set nisdomainname(1)
to your NIS domain name (which equals to IPA domain name
when using hostgroups).</p>

<p>CONFIGURING SSSD TO FETCH SUDO RULES All configuration
that is needed on SSSD side is to extend the list of
services with &quot;sudo&quot; in [sssd] section of
sssd.conf(5). To speed up the LDAP lookups, you can also set
search base for sudo rules using ldap_sudo_search_base
option.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to configure SSSD to
download sudo rules from an LDAP server.</p>

<p>[sssd] config_file_version = 2 services = nss, pam, sudo
domains = EXAMPLE</p>

<p>[domain/EXAMPLE] id_provider = ldap sudo_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://example.com ldap_sudo_search_base =
ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com</p>

<p>When the SSSD is configured to use IPA as the ID
provider, the sudo provider is automatically enabled. The
sudo search base is configured to use the compat tree
(ou=sudoers,$DC).</p>

<p>THE SUDO RULE CACHING MECHANISM The biggest challenge,
when developing sudo support in SSSD, was to ensure that
running sudo with SSSD as the data source provides the same
user experience and is as fast as sudo but keeps providing
the most current set of rules as possible. To satisfy these
requirements, SSSD uses three kinds of updates. They are
referred to as full refresh, smart refresh and rules
refresh.</p>

<p>The smart refresh periodically downloads rules that are
new or were modified after the last update. Its primary goal
is to keep the database growing by fetching only small
increments that do not generate large amounts of network
traffic.</p>

<p>The full refresh simply deletes all sudo rules stored in
the cache and replaces them with all rules that are stored
on the server. This is used to keep the cache consistent by
removing every rule which was deleted from the server.
However, full refresh may produce a lot of traffic and thus
it should be run only occasionally depending on the size and
stability of the sudo rules.</p>

<p>The rules refresh ensures that we do not grant the user
more permission than defined. It is triggered each time the
user runs sudo. Rules refresh will find all rules that apply
to this user, check their expiration time and redownload
them if expired. In the case that any of these rules are
missing on the server, the SSSD will do an out of band full
refresh because more rules (that apply to other users) may
have been deleted.</p>

<p>If enabled, SSSD will store only rules that can be
applied to this machine. This means rules that contain one
of the following values in sudoHost attribute:</p>

<p>&middot; keyword ALL</p>

<p>&middot; wildcard</p>

<p>&middot; netgroup (in the form
&quot;+netgroup&quot;)</p>

<p>&middot; hostname or fully qualified domain name of this
machine</p>

<p>&middot; one of the IP addresses of this machine</p>

<p>&middot; one of the IP addresses of the network (in the
form &quot;address/mask&quot;)</p>

<p>There are many configuration options that can be used to
adjust the behavior. Please refer to &quot;ldap_sudo_*&quot;
in sssd-ldap(5) and &quot;sudo_*&quot; in sssd.conf(5).</p>
