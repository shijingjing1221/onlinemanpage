<p>NAME rquotad, rpc.rquotad - remote quota server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpc.rquotad [ -sSFI ] [ -p port ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rquotad is an rpc(3) server which returns
quotas for a user of a local filesystem which is mounted by
a remote machine over the NFS. It also allows setting of
quotas on NFS mounted filesystem (if configured dur- ing
compilation and allowed by a command line option -S). The
results are used by quota(1) to display user quotas for
remote filesystems and by edquota(8) to set quotas on remote
filesystems. rquotad daemon uses tcp-wrappers library (under
service name rquotad) which allows you to specify hosts
allowed/disallowed to use the daemon (see hosts.allow(5)
manpage for more information). The rquotad daemon is
normally started at boot time from the system startup
scripts.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V, --version Shows version of quota tools.</p>

<p>-s, --no-setquota Dont allow setting of quotas
(default). This option is avail- able only if utilities were
compiled with the rpcsetquota option.</p>

<p>-S, --setquota Allow setting of quotas. This option is
available only if utili- ties were compiled with the
rpcsetquota option.</p>

<p>-F, --foreground Run daemon in foreground (may be useful
for debugging purposes).</p>

<p>-I, --autofs Do not ignore autofs mountpoints.</p>

<p>-p port, --port port Listen on alternate port port.</p>

<p>-x path, --xtab path Set an alternative file with NFSD
export table. This file is used to determine pseudoroot of
NFSv4 exports. The pseudoroot is then prepended to each
relative path (i.e. a path not beginning by /) received in a
quota RPC request.</p>

<p>FILES aquota.user or aquota.group quota file at the
filesystem root (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
quota.user or quota.group quota file at the filesystem root
(version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems) /etc/mtab default
filesystems</p>
