<p>CLOCK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CLOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME clock - report CPU time used</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>clock_t clock(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The clock() function shall return the
implementations best approxima- tion to the processor time
used by the process since the beginning of an
implementation-defined era related only to the process
invocation.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE To determine the time in seconds, the value
returned by clock() should be divided by the value of the
macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC. CLOCKS_PER_SEC is defined to be one
million in &lt;time.h&gt;. If the processor time used is not
available or its value cannot be represented, the function
shall return the value ( clock_t)-1.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE In order to measure the time spent in
a program, clock() should be called at the start of the
program and its return value subtracted from the value
returned by subsequent calls. The value returned by clock()
is defined for compatibility across systems that have clocks
with dif- ferent resolutions. The resolution on any
particular system need not be to microsecond accuracy.</p>

<p>The value returned by clock() may wrap around on some
implementations. For example, on a machine with 32-bit
values for clock_t, it wraps after 2147 seconds or 36
minutes.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
