<p>NAME sd - Driver for SCSI Disk Drives</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/hdreg.h&gt; /* for
HDIO_GETGEO */ #include &lt;linux/fs.h&gt; /* for BLKGETSIZE
and BLKRRPART */</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The block device name has the following
form: sdlp, where l is a letter denoting the physical drive,
and p is a number denoting the partition on that physical
drive. Often, the partition number, p, will be left off when
the device corresponds to the whole drive.</p>

<p>SCSI disks have a major device number of 8, and a minor
device number of the form (16 * drive_number) +
partition_number, where drive_number is the number of the
physical drive in order of detection, and parti- tion_number
is as follows:</p>

<p>partition 0 is the whole drive partitions 1-4 are the
DOS &quot;primary&quot; partitions partitions 5-8 are the
DOS &quot;extended&quot; (or &quot;logical&quot;)
partitions</p>

<p>For example, /dev/sda will have major 8, minor 0, and
will refer to all of the first SCSI drive in the system; and
/dev/sdb3 will have major 8, minor 19, and will refer to the
third DOS &quot;primary&quot; partition on the second SCSI
drive in the system.</p>

<p>At this time, only block devices are provided. Raw
devices have not yet been implemented.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The following ioctls are provided:</p>

<p>HDIO_GETGEO Returns the BIOS disk parameters in the
following structure:</p>

<p>struct hd_geometry { unsigned char heads; unsigned char
sectors; unsigned short cylinders; unsigned long start;
};</p>

<p>A pointer to this structure is passed as the ioctl(2)
parameter.</p>

<p>The information returned in the parameter is the disk
geometry of the drive as understood by DOS! This geometry is
not the physical geometry of the drive. It is used when
constructing the drive s partition table, however, and is
needed for conve- nient operation of fdisk(1), efdisk(1),
and lilo(1). If the geometry information is not available,
zero will be returned for all of the parameters.</p>

<p>BLKGETSIZE Returns the device size in sectors. The
ioctl(2) parameter should be a pointer to a long.</p>

<p>BLKRRPART Forces a re-read of the SCSI disk partition
tables. No parame- ter is needed.</p>

<p>The scsi and ioctl(2) operations are also supported. If
the ioctl(2) parameter is required, and it is NULL, then
ioctl(2) will fail with the error EINVAL.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/sd[a-h]: the whole device /dev/sd[a-h][0-8]:
individual block partitions</p>
