<p>NAME VirtualBindings Bindings for virtual mouse and key
events</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Motif reference pages describe key
translations in terms of virtual bindings, based on those
described in the Motif Style Guide.</p>

<p>Bindings for osf Keysyms Keysym strings that begin with
&lt;osf&gt; are not part of the X servers keyboard mapping.
Instead, these keysyms are produced on the client side at
run time. They are interpreted by the routine
XmTranslateKey, and are used by the translation manager when
the server delivers an actual key event. For each
application, a mapping is maintained between &lt;osf&gt;
keysyms and keysyms that correspond to actual keys. This
mapping is based on information obtained at application
startup from one of the following sources, listed in order
of precedence:</p>

<p>&middot; The XmNdefaultVirtualBindings resource from
Display.</p>

<p>&middot; A property on the root window, which can be set
by mwm on startup, or by the xmbind client, or on prior
startup of a Motif application.</p>

<p>&middot; The file .motifbind in the users home
directory.</p>

<p>&middot; A set of bindings based on the vendor string
and optionally the vendor release of the X server. Motif
searches for these bind- ings in the following steps:</p>

<p>0. If the file xmbind.alias exists in the users home
direc- tory, Motif searches this file for a pathname
associated with the vendor string or with the vendor string
and vendor release. If it finds such a pathname and if that
file exists, Motif loads the bindings contained in that
file.</p>

<p>1. If it has found no bindings, Motif next looks for the
file xmbind.alias in the directory specified by the
environment variable XMBINDDIR, if XMBINDDIR is set, or in
the direc- tory /usr/share/X11/bindings if XMBINDDIR is not
set. If this file exists Motif searches it for a pathname
associ- ated with the vendor string or with the vendor
string and vendor release. If it finds such a pathname and
if that file exists, Motif loads the bindings contained in
that file.</p>

<p>2. If it still has found no bindings, Motif loads a set
of hard-coded fallback bindings.</p>

<p>The xmbind.alias file contains zero or more lines of the
following form:</p>

<p>&quot;vendor_string[ vendor_release]&quot;
bindings_file</p>

<p>where vendor_string is the X server vendor name as
returned by the X client xdpyinfo or the Xlib function
XServerVendor, and must appear in double quotes. If
vendor_release is included, it is the X server ven- dor
release number as returned by the X client xdpyinfo or the
Xlib function XVendorRelease, and must also be contained
within the double quotes separated by one space from
vendor_string. The vendor_release argument is provided to
allow support of changes in keyboard hardware from a vendor,
assuming that the vendor increments the release number to
flag such changes. Alternatively, the vendor may simply use
a unique vendor string for each different keyboard.</p>

<p>The bindings_file argument is the pathname of the file
containing the bindings themselves. It can be a relative or
absolute pathname. If it it is a relative pathname, it is
relative to the location of the xmbind.alias file.</p>

<p>Comment lines in the xmbind.alias file begin with !
(exclamation point).</p>

<p>The bindings found in either the .motifbind file or the
vendor mapping are placed in a property on the root window.
This property is used to determine the bindings for
subsequent Motif applications.</p>

<p>On startup mwm attempts to load the file .motifbind in
the users home directory. If this is unsuccessful, it loads
the vendor bindings as described previously. It places the
bindings it loads in a property on the root window for use
by subsequent Motif applications.</p>

<p>The xmbind function loads bindings from a file if that
file is speci- fied on the command line. If no file is
specified on the command line, it attempts to load the file
.motifbind in the users home directory. If this fails, it
loads the vendor bindings as described previously. It places
the bindings it loads in a property on the root window for
use by subsequent Motif applications.</p>

<p>The format of the specification for mapping &lt;osf&gt;
keysyms to actual keysyms is similar to that of a
specification for an event translation. (See below) The
syntax is specified (and below) here in EBNF notation using
the following conventions:</p>

<p>[a] Means either nothing or a {a} Means zero or more
occurrences of a (a|b) Means either a or b.</p>

<p>Terminals are enclosed in double quotation marks.</p>

<p>The syntax of an &lt;osf&gt; keysym binding
specification is as follows:</p>

<p>binding_spec = {line &quot;0} [line] line =
virtual_keysym &quot;:&quot; list_of_key_event
list_of_key_event= key_event { &quot;,&quot; key_event}
key_event = {modifier_name} &quot;&lt;Key&gt;&quot;
actual_keysym virtual_keysym = keysym actual_keysym = keysym
keysym = A valid X11 keysym name that is mapped by
XStringToKeysym</p>

<p>As with event translations, more specific event
descriptions must pre- cede less specific descriptions. For
example, an event description for a key with a modifier must
precede a description for the same key with- out the same
modifier.</p>

<p>Following is an example of a specification for the
defaultVirtualBind- ings resource in a resource file:</p>

<p>*defaultVirtualBindings: osfBackSpace:
&lt;Key&gt;BackSpace osfInsert: &lt;Key&gt;InsertChar
osfDelete: &lt;Key&gt;DeleteChar ... osfLeft:
&lt;Key&gt;left, Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;H</p>

<p>The format of a .motifbind file or of a file containing
vendor bindings is the same, except that the binding
specification for each keysym is placed on a separate line.
The previous example specification appears as follows in a
.motifbind or vendor bindings file:</p>

<p>osfBackSpace: &lt;Key&gt;BackSpace osfInsert:
&lt;Key&gt;InsertChar osfDelete: &lt;Key&gt;DeleteChar ...
osfLeft: &lt;Key&gt;left, Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;H</p>

<p>The following table lists the fixed fallback default
bindings for &lt;osf&gt; keysyms.</p>

Changes in the Handling of Shifted Keys In conjunction with
MIT X11R5 Patch 24, this version of Motif intro- duces a
change in the way that keys involving the &lt;Shift&gt;
modifier are processed. This change allows the numeric
keypad to be used to generate numbers using the standard X
mechanisms. Since the default behavior is now to honor the
xmodmap keymap bindings, translations and virtual key
bindings that use &lt;Shift&gt; may behave differently. A
common symptom is that unshifted keypad and function keys
(with or without other modi- fiers) produce the expected
results, but shifted ones do not.</p>

<p>To obtain the old behavior you can remove the shifted
interpretation from problematic keys using the xmodmap
utility. Each entry in a xmodmap keymap table contains up to
four keysym bindings. The second and fourth keysyms are for
shifted keys. If an expression contains only two keysyms,
simply remove the second keysym. If an entry contains three
or more keysyms, replace the second keysym with NoSymbol and
remove the fourth keysym.</p>

<p>Action Translations The translation table syntax used by
Motif is completely specified in the X11R5 Toolkit
Intrinsics Documentation. For the complete syntax
description, and for general instructions about writing or
modifying a translation table, please refer to this
document. A brief summary of the translation table format,
however, is included below.</p>

<p>The syntax is defined as in the binding syntax
specification above. Informal descriptions are contained in
angle brackets (&lt;&gt;).</p>

<p>TranslationTable= [ directive ] { production } directive
= ( &quot;#replace&quot; | &quot;#override&quot; |
&quot;#augment&quot;) &quot;0 production = lhs &quot;:&quot;
rhs &quot;0 lhs = ( event | keyseq) {&quot;,&quot; ( event |
keyseq) } keyseq = &quot;&quot;&quot; keychar { keychar }
&quot;&quot;&quot; keychar = ( &quot;^&quot; | &quot;$&quot;
| &quot;\&quot;) &lt;ISO Latin 1 character&gt; event = [
modifier_list ] &quot;&lt;&quot; event_type &quot;&gt;&quot;
[ count ] {detail} modifier_list = (
[&quot;!&quot;][&quot;:&quot;] { modifier } |
&quot;None&quot;) modifier = [ &quot;~&quot; ] (
&quot;@&quot; &lt;keysym&gt; | &lt;name from table
below&gt;) count = &quot;(&quot; &lt;positive integer&gt; [
&quot;+&quot; ] &quot;)&quot; rhs = { action_name
&quot;(&quot; [params] &quot;)&quot; } params = string {
&quot;,&quot; string }</p>

<p>The string field need not be quoted unless it includes a
space or tab character, or any comma, newline, or
parenthesis. The entire list of string values making up the
params field will ba passed to the named action routine.</p>

<p>The details field may be used to specify a keysym that
will identify a particular key event. For example,
&lt;Key&gt; is the name of a type of event, but it must be
modified by the details field to name a specific event, such
as &lt;Key&gt;A.</p>

<p>Modifier Names The modifier list, which may be empty,
consists of a list of modifier keys that must be pressed
with the key sequence. The modifier keys may abbreviated
with single letters, as in the following list of the
familiar modifiers:</p>

<p>s Shift</p>

<p>c or ^ Ctrl (Control)</p>

<p>m or $ Meta</p>

<p>a Alt</p>

<p>Other modifiers are available, such as &quot;Mod5&quot;
and &quot;Button2.&quot; These have no abbreviation
(although the &quot;Button&quot; modifiers may be
abbreviated in combination with events, as outlined below).
If a modifier list has no entries, and is not
&quot;None&quot;, it means the position of the modifier keys
is irrelevant. If modifiers are listed, the designated keys
must be in the specified position, but the unlisted modifier
keys are irrelevant. If the list begins with an exclamation
point (!), however, the unlisted modifiers may not be
asserted. In addition, if a modifier name is pre- ceded by a
tilde (~), the corresponding key must not be pressed.</p>

<p>If a modifier list begins with a colon (:), X tries to
use the standard modifiers (Shift and Lock), if present, to
map the key event code into a recognized keysym.</p>

<p>Event Types These are a few of the recognized event
types.</p>

<p>Key or KeyDown A keyboard key was pressed.</p>

<p>KeyUp A keyboard key was released.</p>

<p>BtnDown A mouse button was pressed.</p>

<p>BtnUp A mouse button was released.</p>

<p>Motion The mouse pointer moved.</p>

<p>Enter The pointer entered the widgets window.</p>

<p>Leave The pointer left the widgets window.</p>

<p>FocusIn The widget has received focus.</p>

<p>FocusOut The widget has lost focus.</p>

<p>There are some event abbreviations available. For
example, &lt;Btn1Motion&gt; is actually a &quot;Motion&quot;
event, modified with the &quot;Button1&quot; modifier
(Button1&lt;Motion&gt;). Similarly, &lt;Btn3Up&gt; is
actually a &quot;BtnUp&quot; event with the
&quot;Button3&quot; modifier. These abbreviations are used
extensively in the Motif translation tables.</p>
