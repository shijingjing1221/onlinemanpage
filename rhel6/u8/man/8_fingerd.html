<p>FINGERD(8) BSD System Manager s Manual FINGERD(8)</p>

<p>NAME fingerd - remote user information server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fingerd [-wulf] [-pL path] [-t timeout]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Fingerd is a simple daemon based on RFC1196
that provides an interface to the finger program at most
network sites. The program is supposed to return a friendly,
human-oriented status report on either the system at the
moment or a particular person in depth.</p>

<p>If the -w option is given, remote users will get an
additional Welcome to ... banner which also shows some
informations (e.g. uptime, operating system name and
release) about the system the fingerd is running on. Some
sites may consider this a security risk as it gives out
information that may be useful to crackers.</p>

<p>If the -u option is given, requests of the form finger
@host are rejected.</p>

<p>If the -l option is given, information about requests
made is logged. This option probably violates users privacy
and should not be used on multiuser boxes.</p>

<p>If the -f option is given, finger forwarding
(user@host1@host2) is allowed. Useful behind firewalls, but
probably not wise for security and resource reasons.</p>

<p>The -p option allows specification of an alternate
location for fingerd to find the finger program. The -L
option is equivalent.</p>

<p>The -t option specifies the time to wait for a request
before closing the connection. A value of 0 waits forever.
The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>Options to fingerd should be specified in
/etc/xinetd.d/finger.</p>

<p>The finger protocol consists mostly of specifying
command arguments. The xinetd(8) super-server runs fingerd
for TCP requests received on port 79. Once connected fingerd
reads a single command line terminated by a CRLF which is
passed to finger(1). It closes its connections as soon as
all output is finished.</p>

<p>If the line is empty (i.e. just a CRLF is sent) then
finger returns a default report that lists all people logged
into the system at that moment. This feature is blocked by
the -u option.</p>

<p>If a user name is specified (e.g. eric CRLF ) then the
response lists more extended information for only that
particular user, whether logged in or not. Allowable names
in the command line include both login names and user names.
If a name is ambiguous, all possible deriva- tions are
returned.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS Connecting directly to the server from a
TIP or an equally narrow-minded TELNET-protocol user program
can result in meaningless attempts at option negotiation
being sent to the server, which will foul up the command
line interpretation.</p>

<p>HISTORY The finger daemon appeared in 4.3BSD.</p>
