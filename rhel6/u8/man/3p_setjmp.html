<p>SETJMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETJMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setjmp - set jump point for a non-local goto</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setjmp(jmp_buf env);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A call to setjmp() shall save the calling
environment in its env argu- ment for later use by
longjmp().</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether setjmp() is a macro or a
function. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to
access an actual function, or a program defines an external
identifier with the name setjmp, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>An application shall ensure that an invocation of
setjmp() appears in one of the following contexts only:</p>

<p>* The entire controlling expression of a selection or
iteration state- ment</p>

<p>* One operand of a relational or equality operator with
the other operand an integral constant expression, with the
resulting expres- sion being the entire controlling
expression of a selection or iter- ation statement</p>

<p>* The operand of a unary!operator with the resulting
expression being the entire controlling expression of a
selection or iteration</p>

<p>* The entire expression of an expression statement
(possibly cast to void)</p>

<p>If the invocation appears in any other context, the
behavior is unde- fined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the return is from a direct invocation,
setjmp() shall return 0. If the return is from a call to
longjmp(), setjmp() shall return a non- zero value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE In general, sigsetjmp() is more useful
in dealing with errors and interrupts encountered in a
low-level subroutine of a program.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;setjmp.h&gt;</p>
