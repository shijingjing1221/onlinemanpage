<p>RRDRESIZE(1) rrdtool RRDRESIZE(1)</p>

<p>NAME rrdresize - alters the size of an RRA and creates a
new .rrd file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rrdtool resize filename rra-num GROW|SHRINK
rows</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The resize function is used to modify the
number of rows in an RRA.</p>

<p>filename the name of the RRD you want to alter.</p>

<p>rra-num the RRA you want to alter. You can find the
number using rrdtool info.</p>

<p>GROW used if you want to add extra rows to an RRA. The
extra rows will be inserted as the rows that are oldest.</p>

<p>SHRINK used if you want to remove rows from an RRA. The
rows that will be removed are the oldest rows.</p>

<p>rows the number of rows you want to add or remove.</p>

<p>NOTES The new .rrd file, with the modified RRAs, is
written to the file resize.rrd in the current directory. The
original .rrd file is not modified.</p>

<p>It is possible to abuse this tool and get strange
results by first removing some rows and then reinserting the
same amount (effectively clearing them to be Unknown). You
may thus end up with unknown data in one RRA while at the
same timestamp this data is available in another RRA.</p>
