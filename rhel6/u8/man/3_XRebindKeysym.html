<p>XLookupKeysym(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XLookupKeysym(3)</p>

<p>NAME XLookupKeysym, XRefreshKeyboardMapping,
XLookupString, XRebindKeysym - handle keyboard input events
in Latin-1</p>

<p>SYNTAX KeySym XLookupKeysym(XKeyEvent *key_event, int
index);</p>

<p>int XRefreshKeyboardMapping(XMappingEvent
*event_map);</p>

<p>int XLookupString(XKeyEvent *event_struct, char
*buffer_return, int bytes_buffer, KeySym *keysym_return,
XComposeStatus *sta- tus_in_out);</p>

<p>int XRebindKeysym(Display *display, KeySym keysym,
KeySym list[], int mod_count, unsigned char *string, int
num_bytes);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS buffer_return Returns the translated
characters.</p>

<p>bytes_buffer Specifies the length of the buffer. No more
than bytes_buffer of translation are returned.</p>

<p>num_bytes Specifies the number of bytes in the string
argument.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>event_map Specifies the mapping event that is to be
used.</p>

<p>event_struct Specifies the key event structure to be
used. You can pass XKeyPressedEvent or
XKeyReleasedEvent.</p>

<p>index Specifies the index into the KeySyms list for the
events KeyCode.</p>

<p>key_event Specifies the KeyPress or KeyRelease
event.</p>

<p>keysym Specifies the KeySym that is to be .</p>

<p>keysym_return Returns the KeySym computed from the event
if this argument is not NULL.</p>

<p>list Specifies the KeySyms to be used as modifiers.</p>

<p>mod_count Specifies the number of modifiers in the
modifier list.</p>

<p>status_in_out Specifies or returns the XComposeStatus
structure or NULL.</p>

<p>string Specifies the string that is copied and will be
returned by XLookupString.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XLookupKeysym function uses a given
keyboard event and the index you specified to return the
KeySym from the list that corresponds to the KeyCode member
in the XKeyPressedEvent or XKeyReleasedEvent struc- ture. If
no KeySym is defined for the KeyCode of the event, XLookup-
Keysym returns NoSymbol.</p>

<p>The XRefreshKeyboardMapping function refreshes the
stored modifier and keymap information. You usually call
this function when a MappingNo- tify event with a request
member of MappingKeyboard or MappingModifier occurs. The
result is to update Xlibs knowledge of the keyboard.</p>

<p>The XLookupString function translates a key event to a
KeySym and a string. The KeySym is obtained by using the
standard interpretation of the Shift, Lock, group, and
numlock modifiers as defined in the X Pro- tocol
specification. If the KeySym has been rebound (see XRebind-
Keysym), the bound string will be stored in the buffer.
Otherwise, the KeySym is mapped, if possible, to an ISO
Latin-1 character or (if the Control modifier is on) to an
ASCII control character, and that charac- ter is stored in
the buffer. XLookupString returns the number of char- acters
that are stored in the buffer.</p>

<p>If present (non-NULL), the XComposeStatus structure
records the state, which is private to Xlib, that needs
preservation across calls to XLookupString to implement
compose processing. The creation of XCom- poseStatus
structures is implementation-dependent; a portable program
must pass NULL for this argument.</p>

<p>The XRebindKeysym function can be used to rebind the
meaning of a KeySym for the client. It does not redefine any
key in the X server but merely provides an easy way for long
strings to be attached to keys. XLookupString returns this
string when the appropriate set of modifier keys are pressed
and when the KeySym would have been used for the
translation. No text conversions are performed; the client
is responsible for supplying appropriately encoded strings.
Note that you can rebind a KeySym that may not exist.</p>
