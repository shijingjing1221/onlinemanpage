<p>PUTENV(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PUTENV(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME putenv - change or add a value to an
environment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int putenv(char *string);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The putenv() function shall use the string
argument to set environment variable values. The string
argument should point to a string of the form &quot; name=
value &quot;. The putenv() function shall make the value of
the environment variable name equal to value by altering an
existing variable or creating a new one. In either case, the
string pointed to by string shall become part of the
environment, so altering the string shall change the
environment. The space used by string is no longer used once
a new string which defines name is passed to putenv().</p>

<p>The putenv() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, putenv() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value and
set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The putenv() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Changing the Value of an Environment Variable
The following example changes the value of the HOME
environment vari- able to the value /usr/home.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; ... static char *var =
&quot;HOME=/usr/home&quot;; int ret;</p>

<p>ret = putenv(var);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The putenv() function manipulates the
environment pointed to by envi- ron, and can be used in
conjunction with getenv().</p>

<p>See exec(), for restrictions on changing the environment
in multi- threaded applications.</p>

<p>This routine may use malloc() to enlarge the
environment.</p>

<p>A potential error is to call putenv() with an automatic
variable as the argument, then return from the calling
function while string is still part of the environment.</p>

<p>The setenv() function is preferred over this
function.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The standard developers noted that putenv() is
the only function avail- able to add to the environment
without permitting memory leaks.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
