<p>NAME vptovf - convert virtual property lists to virtual
font metrics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vptovf [ -verbose ] vpl_name[.vpl]
vfm_name[.vf] tfm_name[.tfm]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The vptovf program translates a (human-oriented)
property list file to a pair of (program-oriented) files in
the VF (virtual font) and TFM (TeX font metric) formats.
Thus, a virtual font file can be edited and its exact
contents can be displayed mnemonically. New virtual fonts,
which map characters as seen by TeX into an arbitrary
sequence of low- level typesetting operations, can also be
created in this way.</p>

<p>All three filenames, vpl_name, vf_name, and tfm_name,
are extended with the appropriate suffix, if they lack
one.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Without the -verbose option, vptovf operates
silently. With it, a ban- ner and progress report are
printed on stdout.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pltotf(1), tftopl(1), vftovp(1).</p>

<p>AUTHORS Donald E. Knuth wrote the program, based in part
on an idea of David Fuchs, starting with the code for
pltotf(1). Karl Berry adapted it for compilation with
web2c.</p>
