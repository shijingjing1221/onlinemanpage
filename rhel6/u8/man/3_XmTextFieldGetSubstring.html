<p>NAME XmTextFieldGetSubstring A TextField function that
retrieves a copy of a portion of the internal text
buffer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/TextF.h&gt; int
XmTextFieldGetSubstring( Widget widget, XmTextPosition
start, int num_chars, int buffer_size, char *buffer);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextFieldGetSubstring retrieves a copy of
a portion of the internal text buffer of a TextField widget.
The function copies a specified num- ber of characters from
a given start position in the internal text buffer into a
buffer provided by the application. A NULL terminator is
placed at the end of the copied data.</p>

<p>The size of the required buffer depends on the maximum
number of bytes per character (MB_CUR_MAX) for the current
locale. MB_CUR_MAX is a macro defined in stdlib.h. The
buffer should be large enough to contain the substring to be
copied and a NULL terminator. Use the following equation to
calculate the size of buffer the application should pro-
vide:</p>

<p>buffer_size = (num_chars* MB_CUR_MAX) + 1 (void)</p>

<p>widget Specifies the TextField widget ID.</p>

<p>start Specifies the beginning character position from
which the data will be retrieved. This is an integer number
of charac- ters from the beginning of the text buffer. The
first charac- ter position is 0 (zero).</p>

<p>num_chars Specifies the number of characters to be
copied into the pro- vided buffer.</p>

<p>buffer_size Specifies the size of the supplied buffer in
bytes. This size should account for a NULL terminator.</p>

<p>buffer Specifies the character buffer into which the
internal text buffer will be copied.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of TextField and its
associated resources, see XmTextField(3).</p>

<p>RETURN XmCOPY_SUCCEEDED The function was successful.</p>

<p>XmCOPY_FAILED The function failed because it was unable
to copy the speci- fied number of characters into the buffer
provided. The buffer size may be insufficient. The contents
of buffer are undefined.</p>

<p>XmCOPY_TRUNCATED The requested number of characters
extended beyond the inter- nal buffer. The function copied
characters between start and the end of the widgets buffer
and terminated the string with a NULL terminator; fewer than
num_chars characters were copied.</p>
