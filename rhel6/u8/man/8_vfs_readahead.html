<p>NAME vfs_readahead - pre-load the kernel buffer
cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = readahead</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>This vfs_readahead VFS module detects read requests at
multiples of a given offset (hex 0x80000 by default) and
then tells the kernel via either the readahead system call
(on Linux) or the posix_fadvise system call to pre-fetch
this data into the buffer cache.</p>

<p>This module is useful for Windows Vista clients reading
data using the Windows Explorer program, which
asynchronously does multiple file read requests at offset
boundaries of 0x80000 bytes.</p>

<p>The offset multiple used is given by the
readahead:offset option, which defaults to 0x80000.</p>

<p>The size of the disk read operations performed by
vfs_readahead is determined by the readahead:length option.
By default this is set to the same value as the
readahead:offset option and if not set explicitly will use
the current value of readahead:offset.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS readahead:offset = BYTES The offset multiple
that causes readahead to be requested of the kernel buffer
cache.</p>

<p>readahead:length = BYTES The number of bytes requested
to be read into the kernel buffer cache on each readahead
call.</p>

<p>The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:</p>

<p>&middot; K - BYTES is a number of kilobytes</p>

<p>&middot; M - BYTES is a number of megabytes</p>

<p>&middot; G - BYTES is a number of gigabytes</p>

<p>EXAMPLES [hypothetical] vfs objects = readahead</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
