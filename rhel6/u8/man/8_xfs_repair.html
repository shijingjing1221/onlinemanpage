<p>NAME xfs_repair - repair an XFS filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_repair [ -dfLnPv ] [ -m maxmem ] [ -c
subopt=value ] [ -o sub- opt[=value] ] [ -t interval ] [ -l
logdev ] [ -r rtdev ] device xfs_repair -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_repair repairs corrupt or damaged XFS
filesystems (see xfs(5)). The filesystem is specified using
the device argument which should be the device name of the
disk partition or volume containing the filesys- tem. If
given the name of a block device, xfs_repair will attempt to
find the raw device associated with the specified block
device and will use the raw device instead.</p>

<p>Regardless, the filesystem to be repaired must be
unmounted, otherwise, the resulting filesystem may be
inconsistent or corrupt.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Specifies that the filesystem image to be
processed is stored in a regular file at device (see the
mkfs.xfs -d file option). This might happen if an image copy
of a filesystem has been copied or written into an ordinary
file. This option implies that any external log or realtime
section is also in an ordinary file.</p>

<p>-L Force Log Zeroing. Forces xfs_repair to zero the log
even if it is dirty (contains metadata changes). When using
this option the filesystem will likely appear to be corrupt,
and can cause the loss of user files and/or data.</p>

<p>-l logdev Specifies the device special file where the
filesystems exter- nal log resides. Only for those
filesystems which use an exter- nal log. See the mkfs.xfs -l
option, and refer to xfs(5) for a detailed description of
the XFS log.</p>

<p>-r rtdev Specifies the device special file where the
filesystems real- time section resides. Only for those
filesystems which use a realtime section. See the mkfs.xfs
-r option, and refer to xfs(5) for a detailed description of
the XFS realtime section.</p>

<p>-n No modify mode. Specifies that xfs_repair should not
modify the filesystem but should only scan the filesystem
and indicate what repairs would have been made.</p>

<p>-P Disable prefetching of inode and directory blocks.
Use this option if you find xfs_repair gets stuck and stops
proceeding. Interrupting a stuck xfs_repair is safe.</p>

<p>-m maxmem Specifies the approximate maximum amount of
memory, in megabytes, to use for xfs_repair. xfs_repair has
its own inter- nal block cache which will scale out up to
the lesser of the processs virtual address limit or about
75% of the systems physical RAM. This option overrides these
limits.</p>

<p>NOTE: These memory limits are only approximate and may
use more than the specified limit.</p>

<p>-c subopt=value Change filesystem parameters. Refer to
xfs_admin(8) for informa- tion on changing filesystem
parameters.</p>

<p>-o subopt[=value] Override what the program might
conclude about the filesystem if left to its own
devices.</p>

<p>The suboptions supported are:</p>

<p>ihash=ihashsize overrides the default inode cache hash
size. The total number of inode cache entries are limited to
8 times this amount. The default ihashsize is 1024 (for a
total of 8192 entries).</p>

<p>bhash=bhashsize overrides the default buffer cache hash
size. The total number of buffer cache entries are limited
to 8 times this amount. The default size is set to use up
the remainder of 75% of the systems physical RAM size.</p>

<p>ag_stride=ags_per_concat_unit This creates additional
processing threads to parallel process AGs that span
multiple concat units. This can significantly reduce repair
times on concat based filesystems.</p>

<p>force_geometry Check the filesystem even if geometry
information could not be validated. Geometry information can
not be validated if only a single allocation group and exist
and thus we do not have a backup superblock available, or if
there are two allocation groups and the two superblocks do
not agree on the filesystem geometry. Only use this option
if you validated the geometry yourself and know what you are
doing. If In doubt run in no modify mode first.</p>

<p>-t interval Modify reporting interval. During long runs
xfs_repair outputs its progress every 15 minutes. Reporting
is only activated when ag_stride is enabled.</p>

<p>-v Verbose output.</p>

<p>-d Repair dangerously. Allow xfs_repair to repair an XFS
filesystem mounted read only. This is typically done on a
root fileystem from single user mode, immediately followed
by a reboot.</p>

<p>-V Prints out the current version number and exits.</p>

<p>Checks Performed Inconsistencies corrected include the
following:</p>

<p>1. Inode and inode blockmap (addressing) checks: bad
magic number in inode, bad magic numbers in inode blockmap
blocks, extents out of order, incorrect number of records in
inode blockmap blocks, blocks claimed that are not in a
legal data area of the filesystem, blocks that are claimed
by more than one inode.</p>

<p>2. Inode allocation map checks: bad magic number in
inode map blocks, inode state as indicated by map (free or
in-use) incon- sistent with state indicated by the inode,
inodes referenced by the filesystem that do not appear in
the inode allocation map, inode allocation map referencing
blocks that do not appear to contain inodes.</p>

<p>3. Size checks: number of blocks claimed by inode
inconsistent with inode size, directory size not block
aligned, inode size not consistent with inode format.</p>

<p>4. Directory checks: bad magic numbers in directory
blocks, incor- rect number of entries in a directory block,
bad freespace information in a directory leaf block, entry
pointing to an unallocated (free) or out of range inode,
overlapping entries, missing or incorrect dot and dotdot
entries, entries out of hashvalue order, incorrect internal
directory pointers, direc- tory type not consistent with
inode format and size.</p>

<p>5. Pathname checks: files or directories not referenced
by a path- name starting from the filesystem root, illegal
pathname compo- nents.</p>

<p>6. Link count checks: link counts that do not agree with
the number of directory references to the inode.</p>

<p>7. Freemap checks: blocks claimed free by the freemap
but also claimed by an inode, blocks unclaimed by any inode
but not appearing in the freemap.</p>

<p>8. Super Block checks: total free block and/or free
i-node count incorrect, filesystem geometry inconsistent,
secondary and pri- mary superblocks contradictory.</p>

<p>Orphaned files and directories (allocated, in-use but
unreferenced) are reconnected by placing them in the
lost+found directory. The name assigned is the inode
number.</p>

<p>Disk Errors xfs_repair aborts on most disk I/O errors.
Therefore, if you are trying to repair a filesystem that was
damaged due to a disk drive failure, steps should be taken
to ensure that all blocks in the filesystem are readable and
writeable before attempting to use xfs_repair to repair the
filesystem. A possible method is using dd(8) to copy the
data onto a good disk.</p>

<p>lost+found The directory lost+found does not have to
already exist in the filesys- tem being repaired. If the
directory does not exist, it is automati- cally created if
required. If it already exists, it will be checked for
consistency and if valid will be used for additional
orphaned files. Invalid lost+found directories are removed
and recreated. Exist- ing files in a valid lost+found are
not removed or renamed.</p>

<p>Corrupted Superblocks XFS has both primary and secondary
superblocks. xfs_repair uses infor- mation in the primary
superblock to automatically find and validate the primary
superblock against the secondary superblocks before
proceeding. Should the primary be too corrupted to be useful
in locating the sec- ondary superblocks, the program scans
the filesystem until it finds and validates some secondary
superblocks. At that point, it generates a primary
superblock.</p>

<p>Quotas If quotas are in use, it is possible that
xfs_repair will clear some or all of the filesystem quota
information. If so, the program issues a warning just before
it terminates. If all quota information is lost, quotas are
disabled and the program issues a warning to that
effect.</p>

<p>Note that xfs_repair does not check the validity of
quota limits. It is recommended that you check the quota
limit information manually after xfs_repair. Also, space
usage information is automatically regenerated the next time
the filesystem is mounted with quotas turned on, so the next
quota mount of the filesystem may take some time.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS xfs_repair issues informative messages as it
proceeds indicating what it has found that is abnormal or
any corrective action that it has taken. Most of the
messages are completely understandable only to those who are
knowledgeable about the structure of the filesystem. Some of
the more common messages are explained here. Note that the
language of the messages is slightly different if xfs_repair
is run in no-modify mode because the program is not changing
anything on disk. No-modify mode indicates what it would do
to repair the filesystem if run without the no-modify
flag.</p>

<p>disconnected inode ino, moving to lost+found</p>

<p>An inode numbered ino was not connected to the
filesystem direc- tory tree and was reconnected to the
lost+found directory. The inode is assigned the name of its
inode number (ino). If a lost+found directory does not
exist, it is automatically cre- ated.</p>

<p>disconnected dir inode ino, moving to lost+found</p>

<p>As above only the inode is a directory inode. If a
directory inode is attached to lost+found, all of its
children (if any) stay attached to the directory and
therefore get automatically reconnected when the directory
is reconnected.</p>

<p>imap claims in-use inode ino is free, correcting
imap</p>

<p>The inode allocation map thinks that inode ino is free
whereas examination of the inode indicates that the inode
may be in use (although it may be disconnected). The program
updates the inode allocation map.</p>

<p>imap claims free inode ino is in use, correcting
imap</p>

<p>The inode allocation map thinks that inode ino is in use
whereas examination of the inode indicates that the inode is
not in use and therefore is free. The program updates the
inode allocation map.</p>

<p>resetting inode ino nlinks from x to y</p>

<p>The program detected a mismatch between the number of
valid directory entries referencing inode ino and the number
of refer- ences recorded in the inode and corrected the the
number in the inode.</p>

<p>fork-type fork in ino ino claims used block bno</p>

<p>Inode ino claims a block bno that is used (claimed) by
either another inode or the filesystem itself for metadata
storage. The fork-type is either data or attr indicating
whether the problem lies in the portion of the inode that
tracks regular data or the portion of the inode that stores
XFS attributes. If the inode is a real-time (rt) inode, the
message says so. Any inode that claims blocks used by the
filesystem is deleted. If two or more inodes claim the same
block, they are both deleted.</p>

<p>fork-type fork in ino ino claims dup extent ...</p>

<p>Inode ino claims a block in an extent known to be
claimed more than once. The offset in the inode, start and
length of the extent is given. The message is slightly
different if the inode is a real-time (rt) inode and the
extent is therefore a real- time (rt) extent.</p>

<p>inode ino - bad extent ...</p>

<p>An extent record in the blockmap of inode ino claims
blocks that are out of the legal range of the filesystem.
The message sup- plies the start, end, and file offset of
the extent. The mes- sage is slightly different if the
extent is a real-time (rt) extent.</p>

<p>bad fork-type fork in inode ino</p>

<p>There was something structurally wrong or inconsistent
with the data structures that map offsets to filesystem
blocks.</p>

<p>cleared inode ino</p>

<p>There was something wrong with the inode that was
uncorrectable so the program freed the inode. This usually
happens because the inode claims blocks that are used by
something else or the inode itself is badly corrupted.
Typically, this message is pre- ceded by one or more
messages indicating why the inode needed to be cleared.</p>

<p>bad attribute fork in inode ino, clearing attr fork</p>

<p>There was something wrong with the portion of the inode
that stores XFS attributes (the attribute fork) so the
program reset the attribute fork. As a result of this, all
attributes on that inode are lost.</p>

<p>correcting nextents for inode ino, was x - counted y</p>

<p>The program found that the number of extents used to
store the data in the inode is wrong and corrected the
number. The mes- sage refers to nextents if the count is
wrong on the number of extents used to store attribute
information.</p>

<p>entry name in dir dir_ino not consistent with .. value
(xxxx) in dir ino ino, junking entry name in directory inode
dir_ino</p>

<p>The entry name in directory inode dir_ino references a
directory inode ino. However, the .. entry in directory ino
does not point back to directory dir_ino, so the program
deletes the entry name in directory inode dir_ino. If the
directory inode ino winds up becoming a disconnected inode
as a result of this, it is moved to lost+found later.</p>

<p>entry name in dir dir_ino references already connected
dir ino ino, junking entry name in directory inode
dir_ino</p>

<p>The entry name in directory inode dir_ino points to a
directory inode ino that is known to be a child of another
directory. Therefore, the entry is invalid and is deleted.
This message refers to an entry in a small directory. If
this were a large directory, the last phrase would read
&quot;will clear entry&quot;.</p>

<p>entry references free inode ino in directory dir_ino,
will clear entry</p>

<p>An entry in directory inode dir_ino references an inode
ino that is known to be free. The entry is therefore invalid
and is deleted. This message refers to a large directory. If
the directory were small, the message would read
&quot;junking entry ...&quot;.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS xfs_repair -n (no modify node) will return a
status of 1 if filesystem corruption was detected and 0 if
no filesystem corruption was detected. xfs_repair run
without the -n option will always return a status code of
0.</p>

<p>BUGS The filesystem to be checked and repaired must have
been unmounted cleanly using normal system administration
procedures (the umount(8) command or system shutdown), not
as a result of a crash or system reset. If the filesystem
has not been unmounted cleanly, mount it and unmount it
cleanly before running xfs_repair.</p>

<p>xfs_repair does not do a thorough job on XFS extended
attributes. The structure of the attribute fork will be
consistent, but only the con- tents of attribute forks that
will fit into an inode are checked. This limitation will be
fixed in the future.</p>

<p>The no-modify mode (-n option) is not completely
accurate. It does not catch inconsistencies in the freespace
and inode maps, particularly lost blocks or subtly corrupted
maps (trees).</p>

<p>The no-modify mode can generate repeated warnings about
the same prob- lems because it cannot fix the problems as
they are encountered.</p>

<p>If a filesystem fails to be repaired, a metadump image
can be generated with xfs_metadump(8) and be sent to an XFS
maintainer to be analysed and xfs_repair fixed and/or
improved.</p>
