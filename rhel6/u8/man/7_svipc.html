<p>NAME svipc - System V interprocess communication
mechanisms</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/sem.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page refers to the Linux
implementation of the System V interprocess communication
(IPC) mechanisms: message queues, semaphore sets, and shared
memory segments. In the following, the word resource means
an instantiation of one among such mechanisms.</p>

<p>Resource Access Permissions For each resource, the
system uses a common structure of type struct ipc_perm to
store information needed in determining permissions to per-
form an IPC operation. The ipc_perm structure, defined by
the &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt; system header file, includes the
following members:</p>

<p>struct ipc_perm { uid_t cuid; /* creator user ID */
gid_t cgid; /* creator group ID */ uid_t uid; /* owner user
ID */ gid_t gid; /* owner group ID */ unsigned short mode;
/* r/w permissions */ };</p>

<p>The mode member of the ipc_perm structure defines, with
its lower 9 bits, the access permissions to the resource for
a process executing an IPC system call. The permissions are
interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>0400 Read by user. 0200 Write by user. 0040 Read by
group. 0020 Write by group. 0004 Read by others. 0002 Write
by others.</p>

<p>Bits 0100, 0010, and 0001 (the execute bits) are unused
by the system. Furthermore, &quot;write&quot; effectively
means &quot;alter&quot; for a semaphore set.</p>

<p>The same system header file also defines the following
symbolic con- stants:</p>

<p>IPC_CREAT Create entry if key doesnt exist.</p>

<p>IPC_EXCL Fail if key exists.</p>

<p>IPC_NOWAIT Error if request must wait.</p>

<p>IPC_PRIVATE Private key.</p>

<p>IPC_RMID Remove resource.</p>

<p>IPC_SET Set resource options.</p>

<p>IPC_STAT Get resource options.</p>

<p>Note that IPC_PRIVATE is a key_t type, while all the
other symbolic constants are flag fields and can be ORed
into an int type variable.</p>

<p>Message Queues A message queue is uniquely identified by
a positive integer (its msqid) and has an associated data
structure of type struct msqid_ds, defined in
&lt;sys/msg.h&gt;, containing the following members:</p>

<p>struct msqid_ds { struct ipc_perm msg_perm; msgqnum_t
msg_qnum; /* no of messages on queue */ msglen_t msg_qbytes;
/* bytes max on a queue */ pid_t msg_lspid; /* PID of last
msgsnd(2) call */ pid_t msg_lrpid; /* PID of last msgrcv(2)
call */ time_t msg_stime; /* last msgsnd(2) time */ time_t
msg_rtime; /* last msgrcv(2) time */ time_t msg_ctime; /*
last change time */ };</p>

<p>msg_perm ipc_perm structure that specifies the access
permissions on the message queue.</p>

<p>msg_qnum Number of messages currently on the message
queue.</p>

<p>msg_qbytes Maximum number of bytes of message text
allowed on the mes- sage queue.</p>

<p>msg_lspid ID of the process that performed the last
msgsnd(2) system call.</p>

<p>msg_lrpid ID of the process that performed the last
msgrcv(2) system call.</p>

<p>msg_stime Time of the last msgsnd(2) system call.</p>

<p>msg_rtime Time of the last msgrcv(2) system call.</p>

<p>msg_ctime Time of the last system call that changed a
member of the msqid_ds structure.</p>

<p>Semaphore Sets A semaphore set is uniquely identified by
a positive integer (its semid) and has an associated data
structure of type struct semid_ds, defined in
&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;, containing the following members:</p>

<p>struct semid_ds { struct ipc_perm sem_perm; time_t
sem_otime; /* last operation time */ time_t sem_ctime; /*
last change time */ unsigned long sem_nsems; /* count of
sems in set */ };</p>

<p>sem_perm ipc_perm structure that specifies the access
permissions on the semaphore set.</p>

<p>sem_otime Time of last semop(2) system call.</p>

<p>sem_ctime Time of last semctl(2) system call that
changed a member of the above structure or of one semaphore
belonging to the set.</p>

<p>sem_nsems Number of semaphores in the set. Each
semaphore of the set is referenced by a non-negative integer
ranging from 0 to sem_nsems-1.</p>

<p>A semaphore is a data structure of type struct sem
containing the fol- lowing members:</p>

<p>struct sem { int semval; /* semaphore value */ int
sempid; /* PID for last operation */ };</p>

<p>semval Semaphore value: a non-negative integer.</p>

<p>sempid ID of the last process that performed a semaphore
operation on this semaphore.</p>

<p>Shared Memory Segments A shared memory segment is
uniquely identified by a positive integer (its shmid) and
has an associated data structure of type struct shmid_ds,
defined in &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;, containing the following
members:</p>

<p>struct shmid_ds { struct ipc_perm shm_perm; size_t
shm_segsz; /* size of segment */ pid_t shm_cpid; /* PID of
creator */ pid_t shm_lpid; /* PID, last operation */
shmatt_t shm_nattch; /* no. of current attaches */ time_t
shm_atime; /* time of last attach */ time_t shm_dtime; /*
time of last detach */ time_t shm_ctime; /* time of last
change */ };</p>

<p>shm_perm ipc_perm structure that specifies the access
permissions on the shared memory segment.</p>

<p>shm_segsz Size in bytes of the shared memory
segment.</p>

<p>shm_cpid ID of the process that created the shared
memory segment.</p>

<p>shm_lpid ID of the last process that executed a shmat(2)
or shmdt(2) system call.</p>

<p>shm_nattch Number of current alive attaches for this
shared memory seg- ment.</p>

<p>shm_atime Time of the last shmat(2) system call.</p>

<p>shm_dtime Time of the last shmdt(2) system call.</p>

<p>shm_ctime Time of the last shmctl(2) system call that
changed shmid_ds.</p>
