<p>SMP_CONF_GENERAL(8) SMP_UTILS SMP_CONF_GENERAL(8)</p>

<p>NAME smp_conf_general - invoke CONFIGURE GENERAL SMP
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_conf_general [--connect=CO] [--expected=EX]
[--help] [--hex] [--inactivity=IN] [--interface=PARAMS]
[--nexus=NE] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--verbose] [--version]
SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP)
CONFIGURE GENERAL request func- tion to a SMP target. The
SMP target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the
--sa=SAS_ADDR. Depending on the interface, the SAS_ADDR may
be deduced from the SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there is
one SMP_DEVICE per machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is
needed to differ- entiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-c, --connect=CO sets the &quot;update STP maximum
connect time limit&quot; flag and the corresponding
&quot;STP maximum connect time limit&quot; field to CO. Unit
of CO is 100 microseconds. A CO of zero is taken to mean no
max- imum connection time limit.</p>

<p>-E, --expected=EX set the expected expander change count
field in the SMP request. The value EX is from 0 to 65535
inclusive with 0 being the default value. When EX is greater
than zero then if the value doesnt match the expander change
count of the SMP target (i.e. the expander) when the request
arrives then the target ignores the request and sets a
function result of &quot;invalid expander change count&quot;
in the response.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --inactivity=IN sets the &quot;update STP bus
inactivity time limit&quot; flag and the corresponding
&quot;STP bus inactivity time limit&quot; field to IN. Unit
of IN is 100 microseconds. A IN of zero is taken to mean no
bus inactivity time limit.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-n, --nexus=NE sets the &quot;update STP SMP I_T nexus
loss time&quot; flag and the cor- responding &quot;STP SMP
I_T nexus loss time&quot; field to NE. Unit of NE is one
millisecond. A NE of zero is taken to mean a vendor spe-
cific amount of time; a NE of 65535 means the port shall
never recognize an I_T nexus loss.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP CONFIGURE GENERAL function was
introduced in SAS-2 .</p>
