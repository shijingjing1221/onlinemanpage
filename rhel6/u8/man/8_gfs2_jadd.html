<p>NAME gfs2_jadd - Add journals to a GFS2 filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfs2_jadd [OPTION]...
&lt;DEVICE|MOINTPOINT&gt;...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gfs2_jadd is used to add journals (and a few
other per-node files) to a GFS2 filesystem. When this
operation is complete, the journal index is updated so that
machines mounting the filesystem at a later date will see
the newly created journals in addition to the journals
already there. Machines which are already running in the
cluster are unaf- fected.</p>

<p>You may only run gfs2_jadd on a mounted filesystem,
addition of jour- nals to unmounted filesystems is not
supported. You only need to run gfs2_jadd on one node in the
cluster. All the other nodes will see the expansion has
occurred when required.</p>

<p>You must be superuser to execute gfs2_jadd. The
gfs2_jadd tool tries to prevent you from corrupting your
filesystem by checking as many of the likely problems as it
can. When growing a filesystem, only the last step of
updating the journal index affects the currently mounted
filesystem and so failure part way through the expansion
process should leave your filesystem in its original
state.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c MegaBytes Initial size of each journals quota
change file</p>

<p>-D Print out debugging information about the filesystem
layout.</p>

<p>-h Prints out a short usage message and exits.</p>

<p>-J size The size of the new journals in megabytes. The
defaults to 32MB (the minimum size allowed is 8MB). If you
want to add journals of different sizes to the filesystem,
you ll need to run gfs2_jadd once for each different size of
journal.</p>

<p>-j num The number of new journals to add.</p>

<p>-q Be quiet. Dont print anything.</p>

<p>-u MegaBytes Initial size of each journals unlinked tag
file</p>

<p>-V Version. Print version information, then exit.</p>
