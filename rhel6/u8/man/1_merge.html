<p>NAME merge - three-way file merge</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS merge [ options ] file1 file2 file3</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION merge incorporates all changes that lead
from file2 to file3 into file1. The result ordinarily goes
into file1. merge is useful for combining separate changes
to an original. Suppose file2 is the origi- nal, and both
file1 and file3 are modifications of file2. Then merge
combines both changes.</p>

<p>A conflict occurs if both file1 and file3 have changes
in a common seg- ment of lines. If a conflict is found,
merge normally outputs a warn- ing and brackets the conflict
with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines. A typi- cal conflict
will look like this:</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; file A lines in file A
======= lines in file B &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; file
B</p>

<p>If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result
and delete one of the alternatives.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A Output conflicts using the -A style of
diff3(1), if supported by diff3. This merges all changes
leading from file2 to file3 into file1, and generates the
most verbose output.</p>

<p>-E, -e These options specify conflict styles that
generate less infor- mation than -A. See diff3(1) for
details. The default is -E. With -e, merge does not warn
about conflicts.</p>

<p>-L label This option may be given up to three times, and
specifies labels to be used in place of the corresponding
file names in conflict reports. That is, merge -L x -L y -L
z a b c generates output that looks like it came from files
x, y and z instead of from files a, b and c.</p>

<p>-p Send results to standard output instead of
overwriting file1.</p>

<p>-q Quiet; do not warn about conflicts. -V Print s
version number.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is 0 for no conflicts, 1 for
some conflicts, 2 for trouble.</p>

<p>BUGS It normally does not make sense to merge binary
files as if they were text, but merge tries to do it
anyway.</p>
