<p>NAME pam_rhosts - The rhosts PAM module</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_rhosts.so</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This module performs the standard network
authentication for services, as used by traditional
implementations of rlogin and rsh etc.</p>

<p>The authentication mechanism of this module is based on
the contents of two files; /etc/hosts.equiv (or and
~/.rhosts. Firstly, hosts listed in the former file are
treated as equivalent to the localhost. Secondly, entries in
the user&acute;s own copy of the latter file is used to map
&quot;remote-host remote-user&quot; pairs to that
user&acute;s account on the current host. Access is granted
to the user if their host is present in /etc/hosts.equiv and
their remote account is identical to their local one, or if
their remote account has an entry in their personal
configuration file.</p>

<p>The module authenticates a remote user (internally
specified by the item PAM_RUSER connecting from the remote
host (internally specified by the item PAM_RHOST).
Accordingly, for applications to be compatible this
authentication module they must set these items prior to
calling pam_authenticate(). The module is not capable of
independently probing the network connection for such
information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>silent Don&acute;t print informative messages.</p>

<p>superuser=account Handle account as root.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the auth module type is
provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTH_ERR The remote host, remote user
name or the local user name couldn&acute;t be determined or
access was denied by .rhosts file.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User is not known to system.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To grant a remote user access by
/etc/hosts.equiv or .rhosts for rsh add the following lines
to /etc/pam.d/rsh:</p>

<p>#%PAM-1.0 # auth required pam_rhosts.so auth required
pam_nologin.so auth required pam_env.so auth required
pam_unix.so</p>
