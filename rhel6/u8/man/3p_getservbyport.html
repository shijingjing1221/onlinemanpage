<p>ENDSERVENT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
ENDSERVENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME endservent, getservbyname, getservbyport,
getservent, setservent - net- work services database
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>void endservent(void); struct servent
*getservbyname(const char *name, const char *proto); struct
servent *getservbyport(int port, const char *proto); struct
servent *getservent(void); void setservent(int
stayopen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall retrieve information
about network services. This information is considered to be
stored in a database that can be accessed sequentially or
randomly. The implementation of this database is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The setservent() function shall open a connection to the
database, and set the next entry to the first entry. If the
stayopen argument is non- zero, the net database shall not
be closed after each call to the get- servent() function
(either directly, or indirectly through one of the other
getserv*() functions), and the implementation may maintain
an open file descriptor for the database.</p>

<p>The getservent() function shall read the next entry of
the database, opening and closing a connection to the
database as necessary.</p>

<p>The getservbyname() function shall search the database
from the begin- ning and find the first entry for which the
service name specified by name matches the s_name member and
the protocol name specified by proto matches the s_proto
member, opening and closing a connection to the database as
necessary. If proto is a null pointer, any value of the
s_proto member shall be matched.</p>

<p>The getservbyport() function shall search the database
from the begin- ning and find the first entry for which the
port specified by port matches the s_port member and the
protocol name specified by proto matches the s_proto member,
opening and closing a connection to the database as
necessary. If proto is a null pointer, any value of the
s_proto member shall be matched. The port argument shall be
in network byte order.</p>

<p>The getservbyname(), getservbyport(), and getservent()
functions shall each return a pointer to a servent
structure, the members of which shall contain the fields of
an entry in the network services database.</p>

<p>The endservent() function shall close the database,
releasing any open file descriptor.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
getservbyname(), getservbyport(), and get- servent() return
a pointer to a servent structure if the requested entry was
found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was
reached or the requested entry was not found. Otherwise, a
null pointer is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The port argument of getservbyport()
need not be compatible with the port values of all address
families.</p>

<p>The getservbyname(), getservbyport(), and getservent()
functions may return pointers to static data, which may be
overwritten by subsequent calls to any of these
functions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
