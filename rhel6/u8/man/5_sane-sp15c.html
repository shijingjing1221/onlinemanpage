<p>sane-sp15c(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-sp15c(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-sp15c - SANE backend for Fujitsu ScanPartner
15C flatbed scanner</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-sp15c library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to
the Fujitsu flatbed scanners. At present, the following
scanner is known to work with these backend:</p>

<p>Vendor: Model: Rev: -------- ---------------- ----- FCPA
ScanPartner 15C 1.01</p>

<p>The ScanPartner 15C driver supports lineart (1-bit),
halftone (1-bit), grayscale (4-bit and 8-bit), and color (3
x 8-bit) scanning.</p>

<p>Other scanners in these families may work. The
ScanPartner 15C seems to be a repackaging of the ScanPartner
600C. People are encouraged to try these driver with the
other scanners and to contact the author with test
results.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION A modest effort has been made to expose
the standard options to the API. This allows frontends such
as xscanimage to set scanning region, resolution, bit-depth
(and color), and enable the automatic document feeder.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Testing limited to a Linux 2.2.5 kernel Cant
quite get the scan page/minute performance in ADF modes.
This may be due to limited system buffer size.</p>

<p>BUGS I m sure there are plenty, and not too well hidden,
but I havent seen them yet. Both scanners claim to have
separate control of resolution in X and Y directions. I
confess I havent tested this yet. I have found that xsane
doesnt even display this capability. Threshold settings on
the SP15C dont seem to affect the results of lineart mode
scans. It might be possible to merge these two drivers
without much effort since the SP15C driver was derived from
the M3096G driver. They were split so as to keep the second
driver development from breaking the working first driver.
Watch this space for changes.</p>
