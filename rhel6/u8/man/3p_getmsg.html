<p>GETMSG(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETMSG(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getmsg, getpmsg - receive next message from a
STREAMS file (STREAMS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getmsg(int fildes, struct strbuf *restrict ctlptr,
struct strbuf *restrict dataptr, int *restrict flagsp); int
getpmsg(int fildes, struct strbuf *restrict ctlptr, struct
strbuf *restrict dataptr, int *restrict bandp, int *restrict
flagsp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getmsg() function shall retrieve the
contents of a message located at the head of the STREAM head
read queue associated with a STREAMS file and place the
contents into one or more buffers. The message con- tains
either a data part, a control part, or both. The data and
control parts of the message shall be placed into separate
buffers, as described below. The semantics of each part are
defined by the origina- tor of the message.</p>

<p>The getpmsg() function shall be equivalent to getmsg(),
except that it provides finer control over the priority of
the messages received. Except where noted, all requirements
on getmsg() also pertain to getpmsg().</p>

<p>The fildes argument specifies a file descriptor
referencing a STREAMS- based file.</p>

<p>The ctlptr and dataptr arguments each point to a strbuf
structure, in which the buf member points to a buffer in
which the data or control information is to be placed, and
the maxlen member indicates the maxi- mum number of bytes
this buffer can hold. On return, the len member shall
contain the number of bytes of data or control information
actu- ally received. The len member shall be set to 0 if
there is a zero- length control or data part and len shall
be set to -1 if no data or control information is present in
the message.</p>

<p>When getmsg() is called, flagsp should point to an
integer that indi- cates the type of message the process is
able to receive. This is described further below.</p>

<p>The ctlptr argument is used to hold the control part of
the message, and dataptr is used to hold the data part of
the message. If ctlptr (or dataptr) is a null pointer or the
maxlen member is -1, the control (or data) part of the
message shall not be processed and shall be left on the
STREAM head read queue, and if the ctlptr (or dataptr) is
not a null pointer, len shall be set to -1. If the maxlen
member is set to 0 and there is a zero-length control (or
data) part, that zero-length part shall be removed from the
read queue and len shall be set to 0. If the maxlen member
is set to 0 and there are more than 0 bytes of con- trol (or
data) information, that information shall be left on the
read queue and len shall be set to 0. If the maxlen member
in ctlptr (or dataptr) is less than the control (or data)
part of the message, maxlen bytes shall be retrieved. In
this case, the remainder of the message shall be left on the
STREAM head read queue and a non-zero return value shall be
provided.</p>

<p>By default, getmsg() shall process the first available
message on the STREAM head read queue. However, a process
may choose to retrieve only high-priority messages by
setting the integer pointed to by flagsp to RS_HIPRI. In
this case, getmsg() shall only process the next message if
it is a high-priority message. When the integer pointed to
by flagsp is 0, any available message shall be retrieved. In
this case, on return, the integer pointed to by flagsp shall
be set to RS_HIPRI if a high- priority message was
retrieved, or 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>For getpmsg(), the flags are different. The flagsp
argument points to a bitmask with the following
mutually-exclusive flags defined: MSG_HIPRI, MSG_BAND, and
MSG_ANY. Like getmsg(), getpmsg() shall process the first
available message on the STREAM head read queue. A process
may choose to retrieve only high-priority messages by
setting the integer pointed to by flagsp to MSG_HIPRI and
the integer pointed to by bandp to 0. In this case,
getpmsg() shall only process the next message if it is a
high-priority message. In a similar manner, a process may
choose to retrieve a message from a particular priority band
by setting the integer pointed to by flagsp to MSG_BAND and
the integer pointed to by bandp to the priority band of
interest. In this case, getpmsg() shall only process the
next message if it is in a priority band equal to, or
greater than, the integer pointed to by bandp, or if it is a
high-pri- ority message. If a process wants to get the first
message off the queue, the integer pointed to by flagsp
should be set to MSG_ANY and the integer pointed to by bandp
should be set to 0. On return, if the message retrieved was
a high-priority message, the integer pointed to by flagsp
shall be set to MSG_HIPRI and the integer pointed to by
bandp shall be set to 0. Otherwise, the integer pointed to
by flagsp shall be set to MSG_BAND and the integer pointed
to by bandp shall be set to the priority band of the
message.</p>

<p>If O_NONBLOCK is not set, getmsg() and getpmsg() shall
block until a message of the type specified by flagsp is
available at the front of the STREAM head read queue. If
O_NONBLOCK is set and a message of the specified type is not
present at the front of the read queue, getmsg() and
getpmsg() shall fail and set errno to [EAGAIN].</p>

<p>If a hangup occurs on the STREAM from which messages are
retrieved, getmsg() and getpmsg() shall continue to operate
normally, as described above, until the STREAM head read
queue is empty. Thereafter, they shall return 0 in the len
members of ctlptr and dataptr.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getmsg() and
getpmsg() shall return a non- negative value. A value of 0
indicates that a full message was read successfully. A
return value of MORECTL indicates that more control
information is waiting for retrieval. A return value of
MOREDATA indi- cates that more data is waiting for
retrieval. A return value of the bitwise-logical OR of
MORECTL and MOREDATA indicates that both types of
information remain. Subsequent getmsg() and getpmsg() calls
shall retrieve the remainder of the message. However, if a
message of higher priority has come in on the STREAM head
read queue, the next call to getmsg() or getpmsg() shall
retrieve that higher-priority message before retrieving the
remainder of the previous message.</p>

<p>If the high priority control part of the message is
consumed, the mes- sage shall be placed back on the queue as
a normal message of band 0. Subsequent getmsg() and
getpmsg() calls shall retrieve the remainder of the message.
If, however, a priority message arrives or already exists on
the STREAM head, the subsequent call to getmsg() or
getpmsg() shall retrieve the higher-priority message before
retrieving the remainder of the message that was put
back.</p>

<p>Upon failure, getmsg() and getpmsg() shall return -1 and
set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getmsg() and getpmsg() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set and no messages are
available.</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor
open for reading.</p>

<p>EBADMSG The queued message to be read is not valid for
getmsg() or getpmsg() or a pending file descriptor is at the
STREAM head.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during getmsg() or
getpmsg().</p>

<p>EINVAL An illegal value was specified by flagsp, or the
STREAM or mul- tiplexer referenced by fildes is linked
(directly or indirectly) downstream from a multiplexer.</p>

<p>ENOSTR A STREAM is not associated with fildes.</p>

<p>In addition, getmsg() and getpmsg() shall fail if the
STREAM head had processed an asynchronous error before the
call. In this case, the value of errno does not reflect the
result of getmsg() or getpmsg() but reflects the prior
error.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting Any Message In the following example,
the value of fd is assumed to refer to an open STREAMS file.
The call to getmsg() retrieves any available message on the
associated STREAM-head read queue, returning control and
data information to the buffers pointed to by ctrlbuf and
databuf, respec- tively.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stropts.h&gt; ... int fd; char
ctrlbuf[128]; char databuf[512]; struct strbuf ctrl; struct
strbuf data; int flags = 0; int ret;</p>

<p>ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf; ctrl.maxlen = sizeof(ctrlbuf);</p>

<p>data.buf = databuf; data.maxlen = sizeof(databuf);</p>

<p>ret = getmsg (fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, &amp;flags);</p>

<p>Getting the First Message off the Queue In the following
example, the call to getpmsg() retrieves the first available
message on the associated STREAM-head read queue.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stropts.h&gt; ...</p>

<p>int fd; char ctrlbuf[128]; char databuf[512]; struct
strbuf ctrl; struct strbuf data; int band = 0; int flags =
MSG_ANY; int ret;</p>

<p>ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf; ctrl.maxlen = sizeof(ctrlbuf);</p>

<p>data.buf = databuf; data.maxlen = sizeof(databuf);</p>

<p>ret = getpmsg (fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, &amp;band,
&amp;flags);</p>
