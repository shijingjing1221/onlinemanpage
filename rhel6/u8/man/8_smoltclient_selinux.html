<p>smoltclient_selinux(8) SELinux Policy smoltclient
smoltclient_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME smoltclient_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the smolt- client processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
smoltclient processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The smoltclient processes execute with the smoltclient_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep smoltclient_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The smoltclient_t SELinux type can be
entered via the smolt- client_exec_t file type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the smoltclient_t
domain are the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>/usr/share/smolt/client/sendProfile.py</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux smoltclient policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their smoltclient processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
smoltclient:</p>

<p>smoltclient_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a smoltclient_t can be used
to make the pro- cess type smoltclient_t permissive. SELinux
does not deny access to permissive process types, but the
AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. smolt- client policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run smoltclient with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to run with
kerberos, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must
turn on the allow_ypbind boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd
shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type smoltclient_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>smoltclient_tmp_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux smoltclient policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their smoltclient processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the
smoltclient, if you wanted to store files with these types
in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command
to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to
put the labels on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t smoltclient_tmp_t
/srv/mysmoltclient_con- tent(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/mysmoltclient_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
smoltclient:</p>

<p>smoltclient_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smoltclient_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the smoltclient_t
domain.</p>

<p>smoltclient_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smoltclient_tmp_t type, if you want
to store smoltclient temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
