<p>GETITIMER(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETITIMER(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getitimer, setitimer - get and set value of
interval timer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getitimer(int which, struct itimerval *value); int
setitimer(int which, const struct itimerval *restrict value,
struct itimerval *restrict ovalue);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getitimer() function shall store the
current value of the timer specified by which into the
structure pointed to by value. The setitimer() function
shall set the timer specified by which to the value
specified in the structure pointed to by value, and if
ovalue is not a null pointer, store the previous value of
the timer in the struc- ture pointed to by ovalue.</p>

<p>A timer value is defined by the itimerval structure,
specified in &lt;sys/time.h&gt;. If it_value is non-zero, it
shall indicate the time to the next timer expiration. If
it_interval is non-zero, it shall specify a value to be used
in reloading it_value when the timer expires. Set- ting
it_value to 0 shall disable a timer, regardless of the value
of it_interval. Setting it_interval to 0 shall disable a
timer after its next expiration (assuming it_value is
non-zero).</p>

<p>Implementations may place limitations on the granularity
of timer val- ues. For each interval timer, if the requested
timer value requires a finer granularity than the
implementation supports, the actual timer value shall be
rounded up to the next supported value.</p>

<p>An XSI-conforming implementation provides each process
with at least three interval timers, which are indicated by
the which argument:</p>

<p>ITIMER_REAL Decrements in real time. A SIGALRM signal is
delivered when this timer expires.</p>

<p>ITIMER_VIRTUAL Decrements in process virtual time. It
runs only when the pro- cess is executing. A SIGVTALRM
signal is delivered when it expires.</p>

<p>ITIMER_PROF Decrements both in process virtual time and
when the system is running on behalf of the process. It is
designed to be used by interpreters in statistically
profiling the execution of inter- preted programs. Each time
the ITIMER_PROF timer expires, the SIGPROF signal is
delivered.</p>

<p>The interaction between setitimer() and any of alarm(),
sleep(), or usleep() is unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getitimer() or
setitimer() shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned
and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setitimer() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value argument is not in canonical form. (In
canonical form, the number of microseconds is a non-negative
integer less than 1000000 and the number of seconds is a
non-negative integer.)</p>

<p>The getitimer() and setitimer() functions may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The which argument is not recognized.</p>
