<p>ASCTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ASCTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME asctime, asctime_r - convert date and time to a
string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *asctime(const struct tm *timeptr);</p>

<p>char *asctime_r(const struct tm *restrict tm, char
*restrict buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For asctime(): The functionality described
on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard.
Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 defers to the ISO C standard.</p>

<p>The asctime() function shall convert the broken-down
time in the struc- ture pointed to by timeptr into a string
in the form:</p>

<p>Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1970</p>

<p>using the equivalent of the following algorithm:</p>

<p>char *asctime(const struct tm *timeptr) { static char
wday_name[7][3] = { &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Mon&quot;,
&quot;Tue&quot;, &quot;Wed&quot;, &quot;Thu&quot;,
&quot;Fri&quot;, &quot;Sat&quot; }; static char
mon_name[12][3] = { &quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;,
&quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;,
&quot;Jun&quot;, &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;,
&quot;Sep&quot;, &quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;,
&quot;Dec&quot; }; static char result[26];</p>

<p>sprintf(result, &quot;%.3s %.3s%3d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d
%n&quot;, wday_name[timeptr-&gt;tm_wday],
mon_name[timeptr-&gt;tm_mon], timeptr-&gt;tm_mday,
timeptr-&gt;tm_hour, timeptr-&gt;tm_min, timeptr-&gt;tm_sec,
1900 + timeptr-&gt;tm_year); return result; }</p>

<p>The tm structure is defined in the &lt;time.h&gt;
header.</p>

<p>The asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime()
functions shall return values in one of two static objects:
a broken-down time struc- ture and an array of type char.
Execution of any of the functions may overwrite the
information returned in either of these objects by any of
the other functions.</p>

<p>The asctime() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The asctime_r() function shall convert the broken-down
time in the structure pointed to by tm into a string (of the
same form as that returned by asctime()) that is placed in
the user-supplied buffer pointed to by buf (which shall
contain at least 26 bytes) and then return buf.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, asctime() shall
return a pointer to the string.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, asctime_r() shall return a
pointer to a character string containing the date and time.
This string is pointed to by the argument buf. If the
function is unsuccessful, it shall return NULL.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Values for the broken-down time
structure can be obtained by calling gmtime() or
localtime(). This function is included for compatibility
with older implementations, and does not support localized
date and time formats. Applications should use strftime() to
achieve maximum portability.</p>

<p>The asctime_r() function is thread-safe and shall return
values in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a
static data area that may be overwritten by each call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

localtime(), mktime(), strf- time(), strptime(), time(),
utime(), the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, &lt;time.h&gt;</p>
