<p>OMEGA(1) OMEGA(1)</p>

<p>NAME omega, iniomega, viromega - extended unicode
TeX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS omega [options] [&amp; format ] [ file |
commands ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run the Omega typesetter on file, usually
creating file.dvi. If the file argument has no extension,
&quot;.tex&quot; will be appended to it. Instead of a
filename, a set of Omega commands can be given, the first of
which must start with a backslash. With a &amp;format
argument Omega uses a dif- ferent set of precompiled
commands, contained in format.fmt; it is usu- ally better to
use the -fmt format option instead.</p>

<p>Omega is a version of the TeX program modified for
multilingual type- setting. It uses unicode, and has
additional primitives for (among other things) bidirectional
typesetting.</p>

<p>The iniomega and viromega commands are Omegas analogues
to the initex and virtex commands. In this installation,
they are symlinks to the omega executable.</p>

<p>Omegas command line options are similar to those of
TeX.</p>

<p>Omega is experimental software.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This version of Omega understands the following
command line options.</p>

<p>--oft format Use format as the name of the format to be
used, instead of the name by which Omega was called or a
%&amp; line.</p>

<p>-halt-on-error Exit with an error code when an error is
encountered during pro- cessing.</p>

<p>--help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>--ini Be iniomega, for dumping formats; this is
implicitly true if the program is called as iniomega.</p>

<p>--interaction mode Sets the interaction mode. The mode
can be one of batchmode, nonstopmode, scrollmode, and
errorstopmode. The meaning of these modes is the same as
that of the corresponding --ipc Send DVI output to a socket
as well as the usual output file. Whether this option is
available is the choice of the installer.</p>

<p>--ipc-start As --ipc, and starts the server at the other
end as well. Whether this option is available is the choice
of the installer.</p>

<p>--kpathsea-debug bitmask Sets path searching debugging
flags according to the bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for
details.</p>

<p>--maketex fmt Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be one of
tex or tfm.</p>

<p>--no-maketex fmt Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be one
of tex or tfm.</p>

<p>--output-comment string Use string for the DVI file
comment instead of the date.</p>

<p>-output-directory directory directory instead of the
current directory. Look up input files in directory first,
the along the normal search path.</p>

<p>--parse-first-line If the first line of the main input
file begins with %&amp; parse it to look for a dump
name.</p>

<p>--progname name Pretend to be program name. This affects
both the format used and the search paths.</p>

<p>--recorder Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a
trace of the files opened for input and output in a file
with extension .ofl. (This option is always on.)</p>

<p>--shell-escape Enable the48rite18{command} construct.
The command can be any Bourne shell command. This construct
is normally disallowed for security reasons.</p>

<p>--version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT See the Kpathsearch library documentation
(the Path specifications node) for precise details of how
the environment variables are used. The kpsewhich utility
can be used to query the values of the variables.</p>

<p>One caveat: In most Omega formats, you cannot use ~ in a
filename you give directly to Omega, because ~ is an active
character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the
filename. Other programs, such as Metafont, do not have this
problem.</p>

<p>TEXMFOUTPUT Normally, Omega puts its output files in the
current directory. If any output file cannot be opened
there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in the
environment variable TEXMFOUT- PUT. There is no default
value for that variable. For example, if you say tex paper
and the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT
has the value /tmp, Omega attempts to create /tmp/paper.log
(and /tmp/paper.dvi, if any output is produced.)</p>

<p>TEXINPUTS Search path for input and openin files. This
should probably start with . , so that user files are found
before system files. An empty path component will be
replaced with the paths defined in the texmf.cnf file. For
example, set TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/usr/tex:&quot; to
prepend the current direcory and /home/user/tex to the
standard search path.</p>

<p>TEXEDIT Command template for switching to editor. The
default, usually vi, is set when Omega is compiled.</p>

<p>FILES The location of the files mentioned below varies
from system to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find
their locations.</p>

<p>omega.pool Encoded text of Omegas messages.</p>

<p>*.oft Predigested Omega format (.oft) files.</p>

<p>NOTES This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.
The complete documen- tation for this version of Omega can
be found in the info manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.</p>

<p>BUGS This version of Omega implements a number of
optional extensions. In fact, many of these extensions
conflict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition
of Omega. When such extensions are enabled, the banner
printed when Omega starts is changed to print Omegak instead
of Omega.</p>

<p>This version of Omega fails to trap arithmetic overflow
when dimensions are added or subtracted. Cases where this
occurs are rare, but when it does the generated DVI file
will be invalid.</p>

<p>The DVI files produced by Omega may use extensions which
make them incompatible with most software designed to handle
DVI files. In order to print or preview them, you should use
odvips to generate a PostScript file.</p>

<p>Omega is experimental software, and if you are an active
user it is strongly recommended that you subscribe to the
Omega mailing list. Visit the Omega website
