<p>NAME pnmscale - replaced by pamscale</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmscale was obsoleted by
pamscale(1),introducedwithNetpbm10.20 (Jan- uary 2004).
pamscale is backward compatible with pnmscale, plus adds
many additional functions, including the ability to process
PAM images.</p>

<p>pnmscale remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm
10.46 (March 2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs
than pamscale due to its age. But now it would just be
clutter.</p>

<p>In Netpbm before 10.20, use the manual for pamscale with
pnmscale. Features that are in pamscale but not pnmscale are
indicated by state- ments that they didnt exist before
10.20.</p>
