<p>NAME rtc - real-time clock</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/rtc.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ioctl(fd, RTC_request, param);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is the interface to drivers for
real-time clocks (RTCs).</p>

<p>Most computers have one or more hardware clocks which
record the cur- rent &quot;wall clock&quot; time. These are
called &quot;Real Time Clocks&quot; (RTCs). One of these
usually has battery backup power so that it tracks the time
even while the computer is turned off. RTCs often provide
alarms and other interrupts.</p>

<p>All i386 PCs, and ACPI based systems, have an RTC that
is compatible with the Motorola MC146818 chip on the
original PC/AT. Today such an RTC is usually integrated into
the mainboards chipset (south bridge), and uses a
replaceable coin-sized backup battery.</p>

<p>Non-PC systems, such as embedded systems built around
system-on-chip processors, use other implementations. They
usually wont offer the same functionality as the RTC from a
PC/AT.</p>

<p>RTC vs System Clock RTCs should not be confused with the
system clock, which is a software clock maintained by the
kernel and used to implement gettimeofday(2) and time(2), as
well as setting timestamps on files, etc. The system clock
reports seconds and microseconds since a start point,
defined to be the POSIX Epoch: Jan 1, 1970, 0:00 UTC. (One
common implementation counts timer interrupts, once per
&quot;jiffy&quot;, at a frequency of 100, 250, or 1000 Hz.)
That is, it is supposed to report wall clock time, which
RTCs also do.</p>

<p>A key difference between an RTC and the system clock is
that RTCs run even when the system is in a low power state
(including &quot;off&quot;), and the system clock can t.
Until it is initialized, the system clock can only report
time since system boot ... not since the POSIX Epoch. So at
boot time, and after resuming from a system low power state,
the system clock will often be set to the current wall clock
time using an RTC. Systems without an RTC need to set the
system clock using another clock, maybe across the network
or by entering that data manually.</p>

<p>RTC functionality RTCs can be read and written with
hwclock(8), or directly with the ioctl requests listed
below.</p>

<p>Besides tracking the date and time, many RTCs can also
generate inter- rupts</p>

<p>* on every clock update (i.e., once per second);</p>

<p>* at periodic intervals with a frequency that can be set
to any power- of-2 multiple in the range 2 Hz to 8192
Hz;</p>

<p>* on reaching a previously specified alarm time.</p>

<p>Each of those interrupt sources can be enabled or
disabled separately. On many systems, the alarm interrupt
can be configured as a system wakeup event, which can resume
the system from a low power state such as Suspend-to-RAM
(STR, called S3 in ACPI systems), Hibernation (called S4 in
ACPI systems), or even &quot;off&quot; (called S5 in ACPI
systems). On some systems, the battery backed RTC cant issue
interrupts, but another one can.</p>

<p>The /dev/rtc (or /dev/rtc0, /dev/rtc1, etc.) device can
be opened only once (until it is closed) and it is
read-only. On read(2) and select(2) the calling process is
blocked until the next interrupt from that RTC is received.
Following the interrupt, the process can read a long
integer, of which the least significant byte contains a bit
mask encoding the types of interrupt that occurred, while
the remaining 3 bytes contain the number of interrupts since
the last read(2).</p>

<p>ioctl(2) interface The following ioctl(2) requests are
defined on file descriptors con- nected to RTC devices:</p>

<p>RTC_RD_TIME Returns this RTCs time in the following
structure:</p>

<p>struct rtc_time { int tm_sec; int tm_min; int tm_hour;
int tm_mday; int tm_mon; int tm_year; int tm_wday; /* unused
*/ int tm_yday; /* unused */ int tm_isdst; /* unused */
};</p>

<p>The fields in this structure have the same meaning and
ranges as for the tm structure described in gmtime(3). A
pointer to this structure should be passed as the third
ioctl(2) argument.</p>

<p>RTC_SET_TIME Sets this RTC s time to the time specified
by the rtc_time structure pointed to by the third ioctl(2)
argument. To set the RTC s time the process must be
privileged (i.e., have the CAP_SYS_TIME capability).</p>

<p>RTC_ALM_READ, RTC_ALM_SET Read and set the alarm time,
for RTCs that support alarms. The alarm interrupt must be
separately enabled or disabled using the RTC_AIE_ON,
RTC_AIE_OFF requests. The third ioctl(2) argument is a
pointer to an rtc_time structure. Only the tm_sec, tm_min,
and tm_hour fields of this structure are used.</p>

<p>RTC_IRQP_READ, RTC_IRQP_SET Read and set the frequency
for periodic interrupts, for RTCs that support periodic
interrupts. The periodic interrupt must be separately
enabled or disabled using the RTC_PIE_ON, RTC_PIE_OFF
requests. The third ioctl(2) argument is an unsigned long *
or an unsigned long, respectively. The value is the
frequency in interrupts per second. The set of allowable
frequencies is the multiples of two in the range 2 to 8192.
Only a privileged process (i.e., one having the
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability) can set frequencies above the
value specified in /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq. (This
file contains the value 64 by default.)</p>

<p>RTC_AIE_ON, RTC_AIE_OFF Enable or disable the alarm
interrupt, for RTCs that support alarms. The third ioctl(2)
argument is ignored.</p>

<p>RTC_UIE_ON, RTC_UIE_OFF Enable or disable the interrupt
on every clock update, for RTCs that support this
once-per-second interrupt. The third ioctl(2) argument is
ignored.</p>

<p>RTC_PIE_ON, RTC_PIE_OFF Enable or disable the periodic
interrupt, for RTCs that support these periodic interrupts.
The third ioctl(2) argument is ignored. Only a privileged
process (i.e., one having the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability)
can enable the periodic interrupt if the frequency is
currently set above the value specified in
/proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq.</p>

<p>RTC_EPOCH_READ, RTC_EPOCH_SET Many RTCs encode the year
in an 8-bit register which is either interpreted as an 8-bit
binary number or as a BCD number. In both cases, the number
is interpreted relative to this RTCs Epoch. The RTC s Epoch
is initialized to 1900 on most systems but on Alpha and MIPS
it might also be initialized to 1952, 1980, or 2000,
depending on the value of an RTC register for the year. With
some RTCs, these operations can be used to read or to set
the RTC s Epoch, respectively. The third ioctl(2) argu- ment
is a unsigned long * or a unsigned long, respectively, and
the value returned (or assigned) is the Epoch. To set the
RTCs Epoch the process must be privileged (i.e., have the
CAP_SYS_TIME capability).</p>

<p>RTC_WKALM_RD, RTC_WKALM_SET Some RTCs support a more
powerful alarm interface, using these ioctls to read or
write the RTC s alarm time (respectively) with this
structure:</p>

<p>struct rtc_wkalrm { unsigned char enabled; unsigned char
pending; struct rtc_time time; };</p>

<p>The enabled flag is used to enable or disable the alarm
inter- rupt, or to read its current status; when using these
calls, RTC_AIE_ON and RTC_AIE_OFF are not used. The pending
flag is used by RTC_WKALM_RD to report a pending interrupt
(so its mostly useless on Linux, except when talking to the
RTC managed by EFI firmware). The time field is as used with
RTC_ALM_READ and RTC_ALM_SET except that the tm_mday,
tm_mon, and tm_year fields are also valid. A pointer to this
structure should be passed as the third ioctl(2)
argument.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/rtc, /dev/rtc0, /dev/rtc1, etc: RTC special
character device files.</p>

<p>/proc/driver/rtc: status of the (first) RTC.</p>

<p>NOTES When the kernels system time is synchronized with
an external refer- ence using adjtimex(2) it will update a
designated RTC periodically every 11 minutes. To do so, the
kernel has to briefly turn off peri- odic interrupts; this
might affect programs using that RTC.</p>

<p>An RTCs Epoch has nothing to do with the POSIX Epoch
which is only used for the system clock.</p>

<p>If the year according to the RTCs Epoch and the year
register is less than 1970 it is assumed to be 100 years
later, that is, between 2000 and 2069.</p>

<p>Some RTCs support &quot;wildcard&quot; values in alarm
fields, to support scenar- ios like periodic alarms at
fifteen minutes after every hour, or on the first day of
each month. Such usage is non-portable; portable user space
code only expects a single alarm interrupt, and will either
dis- able or reinitialize the alarm after receiving it.</p>

<p>Some RTCs support periodic interrupts with periods that
are multiples of a second rather than fractions of a second;
multiple alarms; pro- grammable output clock signals;
non-volatile memory; and other hardware capabilities that
are not currently exposed by this API.</p>
