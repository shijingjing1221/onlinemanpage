<p>SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SCHED_SETSCHEDULER(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sched_setscheduler - set scheduling policy and
parameters (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sched.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sched_setscheduler(pid_t pid, int policy, const
struct sched_param *param);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sched_setscheduler() function shall set
the scheduling policy and scheduling parameters of the
process specified by pid to policy and the parameters
specified in the sched_param structure pointed to by param,
respectively. The value of the sched_priority member in the
sched_param structure shall be any integer within the
inclusive priority range for the scheduling policy specified
by policy. If the value of pid is neg- ative, the behavior
of the sched_setscheduler() function is unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>The possible values for the policy parameter are defined
in the &lt;sched.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>If a process specified by pid exists, and if the calling
process has permission, the scheduling policy and scheduling
parameters shall be set for the process whose process ID is
equal to pid.</p>

<p>If pid is zero, the scheduling policy and scheduling
parameters shall be set for the calling process.</p>

<p>The conditions under which one process has the
appropriate privilege to change the scheduling parameters of
another process are implementation- defined.</p>

<p>Implementations may require that the requesting process
have permission to set its own scheduling parameters or
those of another process. Addi- tionally,
implementation-defined restrictions may apply as to the
appropriate privileges required to set a process own
scheduling pol- icy, or another process scheduling policy,
to a particular value.</p>

<p>The sched_setscheduler() function shall be considered
successful if it succeeds in setting the scheduling policy
and scheduling parameters of the process specified by pid to
the values specified by policy and the structure pointed to
by param, respectively.</p>

<p>If the scheduling policy specified by policy is
SCHED_SPORADIC, the value specified by the
sched_ss_low_priority member of the param argu- ment shall
be any integer within the inclusive priority range for the
sporadic server policy. The sched_ss_repl_period and
sched_ss_init_bud- get members of the param argument shall
represent the time parameters used by the sporadic server
scheduling policy for the target process. The
sched_ss_max_repl member of the param argument shall
represent the maximum number of replenishments that are
allowed to be pending simul- taneously for the process
scheduled under this scheduling policy.</p>

<p>The specified sched_ss_repl_period shall be greater than
or equal to the specified sched_ss_init_budget for the
function to succeed; if it is not, then the function shall
fail.</p>

<p>The value of sched_ss_max_repl shall be within the
inclusive range [1, {SS_REPL_MAX}] for the function to
succeed; if not, the function shall fail.</p>

<p>If the scheduling policy specified by policy is either
SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, the sched_ss_low_priority,
sched_ss_repl_period, and sched_ss_init_budget members of
the param argument shall have no effect on the scheduling
behavior.</p>

<p>The effect of this function on individual threads is
dependent on the scheduling contention scope of the
threads:</p>

<p>* For threads with system scheduling contention scope,
these functions shall have no effect on their
scheduling.</p>

<p>* For threads with process scheduling contention scope,
the threads scheduling policy and associated parameters
shall not be affected. However, the scheduling of these
threads with respect to threads in other processes may be
dependent on the scheduling parameters of their process,
which are governed using these functions.</p>

<p>If an implementation supports a two-level scheduling
model in which library threads are multiplexed on top of
several kernel-scheduled entities, then the underlying
kernel-scheduled entities for the system contention scope
threads shall not be affected by these functions.</p>

<p>The underlying kernel-scheduled entities for the process
contention scope threads shall have their scheduling policy
and associated scheduling parameters changed to the values
specified in policy and param, respectively.
Kernel-scheduled entities for use by process con- tention
scope threads that are created after this call completes
shall inherit their scheduling policy and associated
scheduling parameters from the process.</p>

<p>This function is not atomic with respect to other
threads in the pro- cess. Threads may continue to execute
while this function call is in the process of changing the
scheduling policy and associated scheduling parameters for
the underlying kernel-scheduled entities used by the process
contention scope threads.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the function
shall return the former scheduling policy of the specified
process. If the sched_setscheduler() function fails to
complete successfully, the policy and scheduling parameters
shall remain unchanged, and the function shall return a
value of -1 and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sched_setscheduler() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the policy parameter is invalid, or
one or more of the parameters contained in param is outside
the valid range for the specified scheduling policy.</p>

<p>EPERM The requesting process does not have permission to
set either or both of the scheduling parameters or the
scheduling policy of the specified process.</p>

<p>ESRCH No process can be found corresponding to that
specified by pid.</p>
