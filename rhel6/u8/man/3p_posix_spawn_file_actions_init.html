<p>POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTIONS_DEPOSIX(ProgrammeP
OSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTIONS_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy,
posix_spawn_file_actions_init - destroy and initialize spawn
file actions object (ADVANCED REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;spawn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int
posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
* file_actions); int
posix_spawn_file_actions_init(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *
file_actions);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy()
function shall destroy the object referenced by
file_actions; the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized.
An implementation may cause
posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() to set the object
referenced by file_actions to an invalid value. A destroyed
spawn file actions object can be reinitialized using
posix_spawn_file_actions_init(); the results of otherwise
referencing the object after it has been destroyed are
undefined.</p>

<p>The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function shall
initialize the object referenced by file_actions to contain
no file actions for posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() to
perform.</p>

<p>A spawn file actions object is as defined in
posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .</p>

<p>The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn
file actions object is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function
shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
spawn file actions object.</p>

<p>The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by file_actions is
invalid.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are part of the Spawn
option and need not be provided on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Refer to the RATIONALE in
posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() .</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
