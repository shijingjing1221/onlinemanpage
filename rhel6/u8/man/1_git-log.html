<p>GIT-LOG(1) Git Manual GIT-LOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-log - Show commit logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git log [&lt;options&gt;]
[&lt;since&gt;..&lt;until&gt;] [[--] &lt;path&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Shows the commit logs.</p>

<p>The command takes options applicable to the git rev-list
command to control what is shown and how, and options
applicable to the git diff-* commands to control how the
changes each commit introduces are shown.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p, -u Generate patch (see section on generating
patches).</p>

<p>-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt; Generate diffs with
&lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the usual three.
Implies -p.</p>

<p>--raw Generate the raw format.</p>

<p>--patch-with-raw Synonym for -p --raw.</p>

<p>--patience Generate a diff using the &quot;patience
diff&quot; algorithm.</p>

<p>--stat[=width[,name-width]] Generate a diffstat. You can
override the default output width for 80-column terminal by
--stat=width. The width of the filename part can be
controlled by giving another width to it separated by a
comma.</p>

<p>--numstat Similar to --stat, but shows number of added
and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without
abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For binary
files, outputs two - instead of saying 0 0.</p>

<p>--shortstat Output only the last line of the --stat
format containing total number of modified files, as well as
number of added and deleted lines.</p>

<p>--dirstat[=limit] Output the distribution of relative
amount of changes (number of lines added or removed) for
each sub-directory. Directories with changes below a cut-off
percent (3% by default) are not shown. The cut-off percent
can be set with --dirstat=limit. Changes in a child
directory is not counted for the parent directory, unless
--cumulative is used.</p>

<p>--dirstat-by-file[=limit] Same as --dirstat, but counts
changed files instead of lines.</p>

<p>--summary Output a condensed summary of extended header
information such as creations, renames and mode changes.</p>

<p>--patch-with-stat Synonym for -p --stat.</p>

<p>-z Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new
newlines.</p>

<p>Also, when --raw or --numstat has been given, do not
munge pathnames and use NULs as output field
terminators.</p>

<p>Without this option, each pathname output will have TAB,
LF, double quotes, and backslash characters replaced with ,
0 respectively, and the pathname will be enclosed in double
quotes if any of those replacements occurred.</p>

<p>--name-only Show only names of changed files.</p>

<p>--name-status Show only names and status of changed
files. See the description of the --diff-filter option on
what the status letters mean.</p>

<p>--submodule[=&lt;format&gt;] Chose the output format for
submodule differences. &lt;format&gt; can be one of short
and log. short just shows pairs of commit names, this format
is used when this option is not given. log is the default
value for this option and lists the commits in that commit
range like the summary option of git-submodule(1) does.</p>

<p>--color[=&lt;when&gt;] Show colored diff. The value must
be always (the default), never, or auto.</p>

<p>--no-color Turn off colored diff, even when the
configuration file gives the default to color output. Same
as --color=never.</p>

<p>--color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;] Show colored word diff,
i.e., color words which have changed. By default, words are
separated by whitespace.</p>

<p>When a &lt;regex&gt; is specified, every non-overlapping
match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a word. Anything
between these matches is considered whitespace and
ignored(!) for the purposes of finding differences. You may
want to append |[^[:space:]] to your regular expression to
make sure that it matches all non-whitespace characters. A
match that contains a newline is silently truncated(!) at
the newline.</p>

<p>The regex can also be set via a diff driver or
configuration option, see gitattributes(1) or git-config(1).
Giving it explicitly overrides any diff driver or
configuration setting. Diff drivers override configuration
settings.</p>

<p>--no-renames Turn off rename detection, even when the
configuration file gives the default to do so.</p>

<p>--check Warn if changes introduce trailing whitespace or
an indent that uses a space before a tab. Exits with
non-zero status if problems are found. Not compatible with
--exit-code.</p>

<p>--full-index Instead of the first handful of characters,
show the full pre- and post-image blob object names on the
&quot;index&quot; line when generating patch format
output.</p>

<p>--binary In addition to --full-index, output a binary
diff that can be applied with git-apply.</p>

<p>--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] Instead of showing the full 40-byte
hexadecimal object name in diff-raw format output and
diff-tree header lines, show only a partial prefix. This is
independent of the --full-index option above, which controls
the diff-patch output format. Non default number of digits
can be specified with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p>-B Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete
and create.</p>

<p>-M Detect renames.</p>

<p>-C Detect copies as well as renames. See also
--find-copies-harder.</p>

<p>--diff-filter=[ACDMRTUXB*] Select only files that are
Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D), Modified (M), Renamed
(R), have their type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule,
...) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have
had their pairing Broken (B). Any combination of the filter
characters may be used. When * (All-or-none) is added to the
combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is
no file that matches other criteria, nothing is
selected.</p>

<p>--find-copies-harder For performance reasons, by
default, -C option finds copies only if the original file of
the copy was modified in the same changeset. This flag makes
the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the
source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large
projects, so use it with caution. Giving more than one -C
option has the same effect.</p>

<p>-l&lt;num&gt; The -M and -C options require O(n^2)
processing time where n is the number of potential
rename/copy targets. This option prevents rename/copy
detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets
exceeds the specified number.</p>

<p>-S&lt;string&gt; Look for differences that introduce or
remove an instance of &lt;string&gt;. Note that this is
different than the string simply appearing in diff output;
see the pickaxe entry in gitdiffcore(7) for more
details.</p>

<p>--pickaxe-all When -S finds a change, show all the
changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain
the change in &lt;string&gt;.</p>

<p>--pickaxe-regex Make the &lt;string&gt; not a plain
string but an extended POSIX regex to match.</p>

<p>-O&lt;orderfile&gt; Output the patch in the order
specified in the &lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob
pattern per line.</p>

<p>-R Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index
or on-disk file to tree contents.</p>

<p>--relative[=&lt;path&gt;] When run from a subdirectory
of the project, it can be told to exclude changes outside
the directory and show pathnames relative to it with this
option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the
output relative to by giving a &lt;path&gt; as an
argument.</p>

<p>-a, --text Treat all files as text.</p>

<p>--ignore-space-at-eol Ignore changes in whitespace at
EOL.</p>

<p>-b, --ignore-space-change Ignore changes in amount of
whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line end, and
considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p>-w, --ignore-all-space Ignore whitespace when comparing
lines. This ignores differences even if one line has
whitespace where the other line has none.</p>

<p>--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt; Show the context
between diff hunks, up to the specified number of lines,
thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.</p>

<p>--exit-code Make the program exit with codes similar to
diff(1). That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences
and 0 means no differences.</p>

<p>--quiet Disable all output of the program. Implies
--exit-code.</p>

<p>--ext-diff Allow an external diff helper to be executed.
If you set an external diff driver with gitattributes(5),
you need to use this option with git-log(1) and friends.</p>

<p>--no-ext-diff Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

<p>--ignore-submodules Ignore changes to submodules in the
diff generation.</p>

<p>--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; Show the given source prefix
instead of &quot;a/&quot;.</p>

<p>--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; Show the given destination
prefix instead of &quot;b/&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-prefix Do not show any source or destination
prefix.</p>

<p>For more detailed explanation on these common options,
see also gitdiffcore(7).</p>

<p>-&lt;n&gt; Limits the number of commits to show.</p>

<p>&lt;since&gt;..&lt;until&gt; Show only commits between
the named two commits. When either &lt;since&gt; or
&lt;until&gt; is omitted, it defaults to HEAD, i.e. the tip
of the current branch. For a more complete list of ways to
spell &lt;since&gt; and &lt;until&gt;, see &quot;SPECIFYING
REVISIONS&quot; section in git-rev- parse(1).</p>

<p>--decorate[=short|full] Print out the ref names of any
commits that are shown. If short is specified, the ref name
prefixes refs/heads/, refs/tags/ and refs/remotes/ will not
be printed. If full is specified, the full ref name
(including prefix) will be printed. The default option is
short.</p>

<p>--source Print out the ref name given on the command
line by which each commit was reached.</p>

<p>--full-diff Without this flag, &quot;git log -p
&lt;path&gt;...&quot; shows commits that touch the specified
paths, and diffs about the same specified paths. With this,
the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified
paths; this means that &quot;&lt;path&gt;...&quot; limits
only commits, and doesnt limit diff for those commits.</p>

<p>--follow Continue listing the history of a file beyond
renames.</p>

<p>--log-size Before the log message print out its size in
bytes. Intended mainly for porcelain tools consumption. If
git is unable to produce a valid value size is set to zero.
Note that only message is considered, if also a diff is
shown its size is not included.</p>

<p>[--] &lt;path&gt;... Show only commits that affect any
of the specified paths. To prevent confusion with options
and branch names, paths may need to be prefixed with
&quot;-- &quot; to separate them from options or
refnames.</p>

<p>Commit Formatting --pretty[=&lt;format&gt;],
--format[=&lt;format&gt;] Pretty-print the contents of the
commit logs in a given format, where &lt;format&gt; can be
one of oneline, short, medium, full, fuller, email, raw and
format:&lt;string&gt;. When omitted, the format defaults to
medium.</p>

<p>Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the
repository configuration (see git-config(1)).</p>

<p>--abbrev-commit Instead of showing the full 40-byte
hexadecimal commit object name, show only a partial prefix.
Non default number of digits can be specified with
&quot;--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&quot; (which also modifies diff
output, if it is displayed).</p>

<p>This should make &quot;--pretty=oneline&quot; a whole
lot more readable for people using 80-column terminals.</p>

<p>--oneline This is a shorthand for &quot;--pretty=oneline
--abbrev-commit&quot; used together.</p>

<p>--encoding[=&lt;encoding&gt;] The commit objects record
the encoding used for the log message in their encoding
header; this option can be used to tell the command to
re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by
the user. For non plumbing commands this defaults to
UTF-8.</p>

<p>--no-notes, --show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;] Show the notes
(see git-notes(1)) that annotate the commit, when showing
the commit log message. This is the default for git log, git
show and git whatchanged commands when there is no --pretty,
--format nor --oneline option is given on the command
line.</p>

<p>With an optional argument, add this ref to the list of
notes. The ref is taken to be in refs/notes/ if it is not
qualified.</p>

<p>--[no-]standard-notes Enable or disable populating the
notes ref list from the core.notesRef and notes.displayRef
variables (or corresponding environment overrides). Enabled
by default. See git-config(1).</p>

<p>--relative-date Synonym for --date=relative.</p>

<p>--date={relative,local,default,iso,rfc,short,raw} Only
takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such
as when using &quot;--pretty&quot;. log.date config variable
sets a default value for log commands --date option.</p>

<p>--date=relative shows dates relative to the current
time, e.g. &quot;2 hours ago&quot;.</p>

<p>--date=local shows timestamps in users local
timezone.</p>

<p>--date=iso (or --date=iso8601) shows timestamps in ISO
8601 format.</p>

<p>--date=rfc (or --date=rfc2822) shows timestamps in RFC
2822 format, often found in E-mail messages.</p>

<p>--date=short shows only date but not time, in YYYY-MM-DD
format.</p>

<p>--date=raw shows the date in the internal raw git format
%s %z format.</p>

<p>--date=default shows timestamps in the original timezone
(either committers or authors).</p>

<p>--parents Print the parents of the commit. Also enables
parent rewriting, see History Simplification below.</p>

<p>--children Print the children of the commit. Also
enables parent rewriting, see History Simplification
below.</p>

<p>--left-right Mark which side of a symmetric diff a
commit is reachable from. Commits from the left side are
prefixed with &lt; and those from the right with &gt;. If
combined with --boundary, those commits are prefixed with
-.</p>

<p>For example, if you have this topology:</p>

<p>y---b---b branch B / / / . / / o---x---a---a branch
A</p>

<p>you would get an output like this:</p>

<p>$ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline
A...B</p>

<p>&gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
&lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a -yyyyyyy...
1st on b -xxxxxxx... 1st on a</p>

<p>--graph Draw a text-based graphical representation of
the commit history on the left hand side of the output. This
may cause extra lines to be printed in between commits, in
order for the graph history to be drawn properly.</p>

<p>This implies the --topo-order option by default, but the
--date-order option may also be specified.</p>

<p>Diff Formatting Below are listed options that control
the formatting of diff output. Some of them are specific to
git-rev-list(1), however other diff options may be given.
See git-diff-files(1) for more options.</p>

<p>-c With this option, diff output for a merge commit
shows the differences from each of the parents to the merge
result simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff
between a parent and the result one at a time. Furthermore,
it lists only files which were modified from all
parents.</p>

<p>--cc This flag implies the -c options and further
compresses the patch output by omitting uninteresting hunks
whose contents in the parents have only two variants and the
merge result picks one of them without modification.</p>

<p>-m This flag makes the merge commits show the full diff
like regular commits; for each merge parent, a separate log
entry and diff is generated. An exception is that only diff
against the first parent is shown when --first-parent option
is given; in that case, the output represents the changes
the merge brought into the then-current branch.</p>

<p>-r Show recursive diffs.</p>

<p>-t Show the tree objects in the diff output. This
implies -r.</p>

<p>Commit Limiting Besides specifying a range of commits
that should be listed using the special notations explained
in the description, additional commit limiting may be
applied.</p>

<p>-n number, --max-count=&lt;number&gt; Limit the number
of commits output.</p>

<p>--skip=&lt;number&gt; Skip number commits before
starting to show the commit output.</p>

<p>--since=&lt;date&gt;, --after=&lt;date&gt; Show commits
more recent than a specific date.</p>

<p>--until=&lt;date&gt;, --before=&lt;date&gt; Show commits
older than a specific date.</p>

<p>--author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer
header lines that match the specified pattern (regular
expression).</p>

<p>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt; Limit the commits output to ones
with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular
expression).</p>

<p>--all-match Limit the commits output to ones that match
all given --grep, --author and --committer instead of ones
that match at least one.</p>

<p>-i, --regexp-ignore-case Match the regexp limiting
patterns without regard to letters case.</p>

<p>-E, --extended-regexp Consider the limiting patterns to
be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic
regular expressions.</p>

<p>-F, --fixed-strings Consider the limiting patterns to be
fixed strings (dont interpret pattern as a regular
expression).</p>

<p>--remove-empty Stop when a given path disappears from
the tree.</p>

<p>--merges Print only merge commits.</p>

<p>--no-merges Do not print commits with more than one
parent.</p>

<p>--first-parent Follow only the first parent commit upon
seeing a merge commit. This option can give a better
overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic
branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only
about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and
this option allows you to ignore the individual commits
brought in to your history by such a merge.</p>

<p>--not Reverses the meaning of the ^ prefix (or lack
thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the
next --not.</p>

<p>--all Pretend as if all the refs in refs/ are listed on
the command line as &lt;commit&gt;.</p>

<p>--branches[=pattern] Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/heads are listed on the command line as &lt;commit&gt;.
If pattern is given, limit branches to ones matching given
shell glob. If pattern lacks ?, , or [, / at the end is
implied.</p>

<p>--tags[=pattern] Pretend as if all the refs in refs/tags
are listed on the command line as &lt;commit&gt;. If pattern
is given, limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If
pattern lacks ?, , or [, / at the end is implied.</p>

<p>--remotes[=pattern] Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/remotes are listed on the command line as
&lt;commit&gt;. If pattern is given, limit remote tracking
branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
?, , or [, / at the end is implied.</p>

<p>--glob=glob-pattern Pretend as if all the refs matching
shell glob glob-pattern are listed on the command line as
&lt;commit&gt;. Leading refs/, is automatically prepended if
missing. If pattern lacks ?, , or [, / at the end is
implied.</p>

<p>--bisect Pretend as if the bad bisection ref
refs/bisect/bad was listed and as if it was followed by
--not and the good bisection refs refs/bisect/good-* on the
command line.</p>

<p>--stdin In addition to the &lt;commit&gt; listed on the
command line, read them from the standard input. If a --
separator is seen, stop reading commits and start reading
paths to limit the result.</p>

<p>--cherry-pick Omit any commit that introduces the same
change as another commit on the &quot;other side&quot; when
the set of commits are limited with symmetric
difference.</p>

<p>For example, if you have two branches, A and B, a usual
way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
--left-right, like the example above in the description of
that option. It however shows the commits that were
cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, &quot;3rd
on b&quot; may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this
option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the
output.</p>

<p>-g, --walk-reflogs Instead of walking the commit
ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one
to older ones. When this option is used you cannot specify
commits to exclude (that is, ^commit, commit1..commit2, nor
commit1...commit2 notations cannot be used).</p>

<p>With --pretty format other than oneline (for obvious
reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of
information taken from the reflog. By default, commit@{Nth}
notation is used in the output. When the starting commit is
specified as commit@{now}, output also uses
commit@{timestamp} notation instead. Under --pretty=oneline,
the commit message is prefixed with this information on the
same line. This option cannot be combined with --reverse.
See also git-reflog(1).</p>

<p>--merge After a failed merge, show refs that touch files
having a conflict and dont exist on all heads to merge.</p>

<p>--boundary Output uninteresting commits at the boundary,
which are usually not shown.</p>

<p>History Simplification Sometimes you are only interested
in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a
particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two parts of History
Simplification, one part is selecting the commits and the
other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to
simplify the history.</p>

<p>The following options select the commits to be
shown:</p>

<p>&lt;paths&gt; Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt;
are selected.</p>

<p>--simplify-by-decoration Commits that are referred by
some branch or tag are selected.</p>

<p>Note that extra commits can be shown to give a
meaningful history.</p>

<p>The following options affect the way the simplification
is performed:</p>

<p>Default mode Simplifies the history to the simplest
history explaining the final state of the tree. Simplest
because it prunes some side branches if the end result is
the same (i.e. merging branches with the same content)</p>

<p>--full-history As the default mode but does not prune
some history.</p>

<p>--dense Only the selected commits are shown, plus some
to have a meaningful history.</p>

<p>--sparse All commits in the simplified history are
shown.</p>

<p>--simplify-merges Additional option to --full-history to
remove some needless merges from the resulting history, as
there are no selected commits contributing to this
merge.</p>

<p>A more detailed explanation follows.</p>

<p>Suppose you specified foo as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall
call commits that modify foo !TREESAME, and the rest
TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for foo, they look different
and equal, respectively.)</p>

<p>In the following, we will always refer to the same
example history to illustrate the differences between
simplification settings. We assume that you are filtering
for a file foo in this commit graph:</p>

<p>.-A---M---N---O---P / / / / / I B C D E / / / /
-------------&acute;</p>

<p>The horizontal line of history AP is taken to be the
first parent of each merge. The commits are:</p>

<p>&middot; I is the initial commit, in which foo exists
with contents &quot;asdf&quot;, and a file quux exists with
contents &quot;quux&quot;. Initial commits are compared to
an empty tree, so I is !TREESAME.</p>

<p>&middot; In A, foo contains just &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; B contains the same change as A. Its merge M is
trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents.</p>

<p>&middot; C does not change foo, but its merge N changes
it to &quot;foobar&quot;, so it is not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>

<p>&middot; D sets foo to &quot;baz&quot;. Its merge O
combines the strings from N and D to &quot;foobarbaz&quot;;
i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.</p>

<p>&middot; E changes quux to &quot;xyzzy&quot;, and its
merge P combines the strings to &quot;quux xyzzy&quot;.
Despite appearing interesting, P is TREESAME to all
parents.</p>

<p>rev-list walks backwards through history, including or
excluding commits based on whether --full-history and/or
parent rewriting (via --parents or --children) are used. The
following settings are available.</p>

<p>Default mode Commits are included if they are not
TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see
--sparse below). If the commit was a merge, and it was
TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even if
there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of
them.) Otherwise, follow all parents.</p>

<p>This results in:</p>

<p>.-A---N---O / / I---------D</p>

<p>Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if
one is available, removed B from consideration entirely. C
was considered via N, but is TREESAME. Root commits are
compared to an empty tree, so I is !TREESAME.</p>

<p>Parent/child relations are only visible with --parents,
but that does not affect the commits selected in default
mode, so we have shown the parent lines.</p>

<p>--full-history without parent rewriting This mode
differs from the default in one point: always follow all
parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them.
Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are
included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In
the example, we get</p>

<p>I A B N D O</p>

<p>P and M were excluded because they are TREESAME to a
parent. E, C and B were all walked, but only B was
!TREESAME, so the others do not appear.</p>

<p>Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really
possible to talk about the parent/child relationships
between the commits, so we show them disconnected.</p>

<p>--full-history with parent rewriting Ordinary commits
are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be
changed, see --sparse below).</p>

<p>Merges are always included. However, their parent list
is rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are
not included themselves. This results in</p>

<p>.-A---M---N---O---P / / / / / I B / D / / / / /
-------------&acute;</p>

<p>Compare to --full-history without rewriting above. Note
that E was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the
parent list of P was rewritten to contain E&acute;s parent
I. The same happened for C and N. Note also that P was
included despite being TREESAME.</p>

<p>In addition to the above settings, you can change
whether TREESAME affects inclusion:</p>

<p>--dense Commits that are walked are included if they are
not TREESAME to any parent.</p>

<p>--sparse All commits that are walked are included.</p>

<p>Note that without --full-history, this still simplifies
merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only
that one, so the other sides of the merge are never
walked.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a fourth simplification mode
available:</p>

<p>--simplify-merges First, build a history graph in the
same way that --full-history with parent rewriting does (see
above).</p>

<p>Then simplify each commit C to its replacement C in the
final history according to the following rules:</p>

<p>&middot; Set C to C.</p>

<p>&middot; Replace each parent P of C with its
simplification P. In the process, drop parents that are
ancestors of other parents, and remove duplicates.</p>

<p>&middot; If after this parent rewriting, C is a root or
merge commit (has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit,
or !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its
only parent. The effect of this is best shown by way of
comparing to --full-history with parent rewriting. The
example turns into:</p>

<p>.-A---M---N---O / / / I B D / / ---------&acute;</p>

<p>Note the major differences in N and P over
--full-history:</p>

<p>&middot; N&acute;s parent list had I removed, because it
is an ancestor of the other parent M. Still, N remained
because it is !TREESAME.</p>

<p>&middot; P&acute;s parent list similarly had I removed.
P was then removed completely, because it had one parent and
is TREESAME.</p>

<p>The --simplify-by-decoration option allows you to view
only the big picture of the topology of the history, by
omitting commits that are not referenced by tags. Commits
are marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept after history
simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the
paths given on the command line. All other commits are
marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).</p>

<p>Commit Ordering By default, the commits are shown in
reverse chronological order.</p>

<p>--topo-order This option makes them appear in
topological order (i.e. descendant commits are shown before
their parents).</p>

<p>--date-order This option is similar to --topo-order in
the sense that no parent comes before all of its children,
but otherwise things are still ordered in the commit
timestamp order.</p>

<p>--reverse Output the commits in reverse order. Cannot be
combined with --walk-reflogs.</p>

<p>Object Traversal These options are mostly targeted for
packing of git repositories.</p>

<p>--objects Print the object IDs of any object referenced
by the listed commits. --objects foo ^bar thus means
&quot;send me all object IDs which I need to download if I
have the commit object bar, but not foo&quot;.</p>

<p>--objects-edge Similar to --objects, but also print the
IDs of excluded commits prefixed with a &quot;-&quot;
character. This is used by git-pack-objects(1) to build
&quot;thin&quot; pack, which records objects in deltified
form based on objects contained in these excluded commits to
reduce network traffic.</p>

<p>--unpacked Only useful with --objects; print the object
IDs that are not in packs.</p>

<p>--no-walk Only show the given revs, but do not traverse
their ancestors.</p>

<p>--do-walk Overrides a previous --no-walk.</p>

<p>PRETTY FORMATS If the commit is a merge, and if the
pretty-format is not oneline, email or raw, an additional
line is inserted before the Author: line. This line begins
with &quot;Merge: &quot; and the sha1s of ancestral commits
are printed, separated by spaces. Note that the listed
commits may not necessarily be the list of the direct parent
commits if you have limited your view of history: for
example, if you are only interested in changes related to a
certain directory or file.</p>

<p>Here are some additional details for each format:</p>

<p>&middot; oneline</p>

<p>&lt;sha1&gt; &lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p>This is designed to be as compact as possible.</p>

<p>&middot; short</p>

<p>commit &lt;sha1&gt; Author: &lt;author&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; medium</p>

<p>commit &lt;sha1&gt; Author: &lt;author&gt; Date:
&lt;author date&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; full</p>

<p>commit &lt;sha1&gt; Author: &lt;author&gt; Commit:
&lt;committer&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; fuller</p>

<p>commit &lt;sha1&gt; Author: &lt;author&gt; AuthorDate:
&lt;author date&gt; Commit: &lt;committer&gt; CommitDate:
&lt;committer date&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;title line&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; email</p>

<p>From &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;date&gt; From: &lt;author&gt;
Date: &lt;author date&gt; Subject: [PATCH] &lt;title
line&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;full commit message&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; raw</p>

<p>The raw format shows the entire commit exactly as stored
in the commit object. Notably, the SHA1s are displayed in
full, regardless of whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are
used, and parents information show the true parent commits,
without taking grafts nor history simplification into
account.</p>

<p>&middot; format:</p>

<p>The format: format allows you to specify which
information you want to show. It works a little bit like
printf format, with the notable exception that you get a
newline with %n instead of n.</p>

<p>E.g, format:&quot;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe
title was &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n&quot; would show something
like this:</p>

<p>The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt;
for traditional diff input.&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>The placeholders are:</p>

<p>&middot; %H: commit hash</p>

<p>&middot; %h: abbreviated commit hash</p>

<p>&middot; %T: tree hash</p>

<p>&middot; %t: abbreviated tree hash</p>

<p>&middot; %P: parent hashes</p>

<p>&middot; %p: abbreviated parent hashes</p>

<p>&middot; %an: author name</p>

<p>&middot; %aN: author name (respecting .mailmap, see
git-shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))</p>

<p>&middot; %ae: author email</p>

<p>&middot; %aE: author email (respecting .mailmap, see
git-shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))</p>

<p>&middot; %ad: author date (format respects --date=
option)</p>

<p>&middot; %aD: author date, RFC2822 style</p>

<p>&middot; %ar: author date, relative</p>

<p>&middot; %at: author date, UNIX timestamp</p>

<p>&middot; %ai: author date, ISO 8601 format</p>

<p>&middot; %cn: committer name</p>

<p>&middot; %cN: committer name (respecting .mailmap, see
git-shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))</p>

<p>&middot; %ce: committer email</p>

<p>&middot; %cE: committer email (respecting .mailmap, see
git-shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))</p>

<p>&middot; %cd: committer date</p>

<p>&middot; %cD: committer date, RFC2822 style</p>

<p>&middot; %cr: committer date, relative</p>

<p>&middot; %ct: committer date, UNIX timestamp</p>

<p>&middot; %ci: committer date, ISO 8601 format</p>

<p>&middot; %d: ref names, like the --decorate option of
git-log(1)</p>

<p>&middot; %e: encoding</p>

<p>&middot; %s: subject</p>

<p>&middot; %f: sanitized subject line, suitable for a
filename</p>

<p>&middot; %b: body</p>

<p>&middot; %N: commit notes</p>

<p>&middot; %gD: reflog selector, e.g., refs/stash@{1}</p>

<p>&middot; %gd: shortened reflog selector, e.g.,
stash@{1}</p>

<p>&middot; %gs: reflog subject</p>

<p>&middot; %Cred: switch color to red</p>

<p>&middot; %Cgreen: switch color to green</p>

<p>&middot; %Cblue: switch color to blue</p>

<p>&middot; %Creset: reset color</p>

<p>&middot; %C(...): color specification, as described in
color.branch.* config option</p>

<p>&middot; %m: left, right or boundary mark</p>

<p>&middot; %n: newline</p>

<p>&middot; %%: a raw %</p>

<p>&middot; %x00: print a byte from a hex code</p>

<p>&middot; %w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]]):
switch line wrapping, like the -w option of
git-shortlog(1).</p>

<p>Note Some placeholders may depend on other options given
to the revision traversal engine. For example, the %g*
reflog options will insert an empty string unless we are
traversing reflog entries (e.g., by git log -g). The %d
placeholder will use the &quot;short&quot; decoration format
if --decorate was not already provided on the command
line.</p>

<p>If you add a + (plus sign) after % of a placeholder, a
line-feed is inserted immediately before the expansion if
and only if the placeholder expands to a non-empty
string.</p>

<p>If you add a - (minus sign) after % of a placeholder,
line-feeds that immediately precede the expansion are
deleted if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty
string.</p>

<p>&middot; tformat:</p>

<p>The tformat: format works exactly like format:, except
that it provides &quot;terminator&quot; semantics instead of
&quot;separator&quot; semantics. In other words, each commit
has the message terminator character (usually a newline)
appended, rather than a separator placed between entries.
This means that the final entry of a single-line format will
be properly terminated with a new line, just as the
&quot;oneline&quot; format does. For example:</p>

<p>$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef | perl -pe
&acute;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE0 unless /0&acute; 4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE</p>

<p>$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef | perl -pe
&acute;$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE0 unless /0&acute; 4da45be
7134973</p>

<p>In addition, any unrecognized string that has a % in it
is interpreted as if it has tformat: in front of it. For
example, these two are equivalent:</p>

<p>$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef $ git log -2
--pretty=%h 4da45bef</p>

<p>GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P When
&quot;git-diff-index&quot;, &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;, or
&quot;git-diff-files&quot; are run with a -p option,
&quot;git diff&quot; without the --raw option, or &quot;git
log&quot; with the &quot;-p&quot; option, they do not
produce the output described above; instead they produce a
patch file. You can customize the creation of such patches
via the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment
variables.</p>

<p>What the -p option produces is slightly different from
the traditional diff format.</p>

<p>1. It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header,
that looks like this:</p>

<p>diff --git a/file1 b/file2</p>

<p>The a/ and b/ filenames are the same unless rename/copy
is involved. Especially, even for a creation or a deletion,
/dev/null is not used in place of a/ or b/ filenames.</p>

<p>When rename/copy is involved, file1 and file2 show the
name of the source file of the rename/copy and the name of
the file that rename/copy produces, respectively.</p>

<p>2. It is followed by one or more extended header
lines:</p>

<p>old mode &lt;mode&gt; new mode &lt;mode&gt; deleted file
mode &lt;mode&gt; new file mode &lt;mode&gt; copy from
&lt;path&gt; copy to &lt;path&gt; rename from &lt;path&gt;
rename to &lt;path&gt; similarity index &lt;number&gt;
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt; index
&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p>3. TAB, LF, double quote and backslash characters in
pathnames are represented as , 0 for such substitution then
the whole pathname is put in double quotes.</p>

<p>The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged
lines, and the dissimilarity index is the percentage of
changed lines. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a
percent sign. The similarity index value of 100% is thus
reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means
that no line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>

<p>COMBINED DIFF FORMAT &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;,
&quot;git-diff-files&quot; and &quot;git-diff&quot; can take
-c or --cc option to produce combined diff. For showing a
merge commit with &quot;git log -p&quot;, this is the
default format; you can force showing full diff with the -m
option. A combined diff format looks like this:</p>

<p>diff --combined describe.c index
fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510 --- a/describe.c +++ b/describe.c
@@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@ return (a_date &gt; b_date) ?
-1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 : 1; }</p>

<p>- static void describe(char *arg) -static void
describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one) ++static void
describe(char *arg, int last_one) { + unsigned char
sha1[20]; + struct commit *cmit; struct commit_list *list;
static int initialized = 0; struct commit_name *n;</p>

<p>+ if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) &lt; 0) +
usage(describe_usage); + cmit =
lookup_commit_reference(sha1); + if (!cmit) +
usage(describe_usage); + if (!initialized) { initialized =
1; for_each_ref(get_name);</p>

<p>1. It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header,
that looks like this (when -c option is used):</p>

<p>diff --combined file</p>

<p>or like this (when --cc option is used):</p>

<p>diff --cc file</p>

<p>2. It is followed by one or more extended header lines
(this example shows a merge with two parents):</p>

<p>index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; mode
&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; new file mode
&lt;mode&gt; deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p>The mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; line
appears only if at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is
different from the rest. Extended headers with information
about detected contents movement (renames and copying
detection) are designed to work with diff of two
&lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined diff
format.</p>

<p>3. It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file
header</p>

<p>--- a/file +++ b/file</p>

<p>Similar to two-line header for traditional unified diff
format, /dev/null is used to signal created or deleted
files.</p>

<p>4. Chunk header format is modified to prevent people
from accidentally feeding it to patch -p1. Combined diff
format was created for review of merge commit changes, and
was not meant for apply. The change is similar to the change
in the extended index header:</p>

<p>@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt;
&lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@</p>

<p>There are (number of parents + 1) @ characters in the
chunk header for combined diff format.</p>

<p>Unlike the traditional unified diff format, which shows
two files A and B with a single column that has - (minus
appears in A but removed in B), + (plus missing in A but
added to B), or &quot; &quot; (space unchanged) prefix, this
format compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one
file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN. One
column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to
note how Xs line is different from it.</p>

<p>A - character in the column N means that the line
appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result. A +
character in the column N means that the line appears in the
result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words,
the line was added, from the point of view of that
parent).</p>

<p>In the above example output, the function signature was
changed from both files (hence two - removals from both
file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean one line that was added
does not appear in either file1 nor file2). Also eight other
lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2
(hence prefixed with +).</p>

<p>When shown by git diff-tree -c, it compares the parents
of a merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN
are the parents). When shown by git diff-files -c, it
compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working
tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our
version&quot;, file2 is stage 3 aka &quot;their
version&quot;).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES git log --no-merges Show the whole commit
history, but skip any merges</p>

<p>git log v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi Show all
commits since version v2.6.12 that changed any file in the
include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories</p>

<p>git log --since=&quot;2 weeks ago&quot; -- gitk Show the
changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk. The
&quot;--&quot; is necessary to avoid confusion with the
branch named gitk</p>

<p>git log --name-status release..test Show the commits
that are in the &quot;test&quot; branch but not yet in the
&quot;release&quot; branch, along with the list of paths
each commit modifies.</p>

<p>git log --follow builtin-rev-list.c Shows the commits
that changed builtin-rev-list.c, including those commits
that occurred before the file was given its present
name.</p>

<p>git log --branches --not --remotes=origin Shows all
commits that are in any of local branches but not in any of
remote tracking branches for origin (what you have that
origin doesnt).</p>

<p>git log master --not --remotes=*/master Shows all
commits that are in local master but not in any remote
repository master branches.</p>

<p>git log -p -m --first-parent Shows the history including
change diffs, but only from the &quot;main branch&quot;
perspective, skipping commits that come from merged
branches, and showing full diffs of changes introduced by
the merges. This makes sense only when following a strict
policy of merging all topic branches when staying on a
single integration branch.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION At the core level, git is character encoding
agnostic.</p>

<p>&middot; The pathnames recorded in the index and in the
tree objects are treated as uninterpreted sequences of
non-NUL bytes. What readdir(2) returns are what are recorded
and compared with the data git keeps track of, which in turn
are expected to be what lstat(2) and creat(2) accepts. There
is no such thing as pathname encoding translation.</p>

<p>&middot; The contents of the blob objects are
uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no encoding
translation at the core level.</p>

<p>&middot; The commit log messages are uninterpreted
sequences of non-NUL bytes.</p>

<p>Although we encourage that the commit log messages are
encoded in UTF-8, both the core and git Porcelain are
designed not to force UTF-8 on projects. If all participants
of a particular project find it more convenient to use
legacy encodings, git does not forbid it. However, there are
a few things to keep in mind.</p>

<p>1. git commit and git commit-tree issues a warning if
the commit log message given to it does not look like a
valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project
uses a legacy encoding. The way to say this is to have
i18n.commitencoding in .git/config file, like this:</p>

<p>[i18n] commitencoding = ISO-8859-1</p>

<p>Commit objects created with the above setting record the
value of i18n.commitencoding in its encoding header. This is
to help other people who look at them later. Lack of this
header implies that the commit log message is encoded in
UTF-8.</p>

<p>2. git log, git show, git blame and friends look at the
encoding header of a commit object, and try to re-code the
log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can
specify the desired output encoding with
i18n.logoutputencoding in .git/config file, like this:</p>

<p>[i18n] logoutputencoding = ISO-8859-1</p>

<p>If you do not have this configuration variable, the
value of i18n.commitencoding is used instead.</p>

<p>Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the
commit log message when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at
the commit object level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not
necessarily a reversible operation.</p>
