<p>NAME pamtohdiff - convert PAM image to horizontal
difference image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtohdiff [pamfile] [-verbose]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphens to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtohdiff takes a PAM (or PNM) image as input and
produced a horizon- tal difference image version of it as
output. A horizontal difference image is one where the
samples in each row indicate the difference between the
sample value in the corresponding sample of the input image
and the sample directly above it (in the previous row) in
the input image. The horizontal difference image has the
property that if a row of the original image is identical to
the row above it over a long extent, the corresponding row
in the horizontal difference image will contain all zeroes.
That makes it compress better than the original image.</p>

<p>Because the horizontal difference samples can be
positive or negative, but PAM samples are unsigned integers,
the samples in the horizontal difference image PAM are
defined to be the difference modulus the range of the input
(maxval + 1). This doesn t lose any information, as it might
seem, because: of the two differences that could result in
the same pamtohdiff output value (e.g. if maxval is 99, +20
and -80 would both result in &quot;20&quot; in the output),
only one is possible in context and the other would result,
when reconstructing the original image, in a value less than
0 or greater than maxval.</p>

<p>Before the modulus operation, the values pamtohdiff
computes are also biased by half the maxval. This is to make
the results easier to inspect visually. Because of the bias,
you can display the pamtohdiff output as if it were a PNM
image. As long as none of your differences are more than
half the maxval, large negative differences show up as dark
spots, smaller negative differences are lighter, zero
differences are medium intensity, and positive differences
are light. If you want this to work even for images that
have differences that exceed half the maxval, just use
ppmdim 50 on the original image. To avoid losing
information, though, do a pamdepth to double the maxval
first.</p>

<p>Note that because of the transfer function just
described, a difference of zero, which is most common, is
represented by a PAM sample value in the output of one half
the maxval.</p>

<p>The output PAM has a tuple type of
&quot;hdiff&quot;.</p>

<p>You can use hdifftopam to recover the original image
from a horizontal difference image PAM.</p>
