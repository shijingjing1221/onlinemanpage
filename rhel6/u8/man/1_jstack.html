<p>jstack(1) Troubleshooting Tools jstack(1)</p>

<p>NAME jstack - Prints Java thread stack traces for a Java
process, core file, or remote debug server. This command is
experimental and unsupported.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jstack [ options ] pid</p>

<p>jstack [ options ] executable core</p>

<p>jstack [ options ] [ server-id@ ]
remote-hostname-or-IP</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>pid The process ID for which the stack trace is printed.
The process must be a Java process. To get a list of Java
processes running on a machine, use the jps(1) command.</p>

<p>executable The Java executable from which the core dump
was produced.</p>

<p>core The core file for which the stack trace is to be
printed.</p>

<p>remote-hostname-or-IP The remote debug server hostname
or IP address. See jsadebugd(1).</p>

<p>server-id An optional unique ID to use when multiple
debug servers are running on the same remote host.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jstack command prints Java stack traces
of Java threads for a specified Java process, core file, or
remote debug server. For each Java frame, the full class
name, method name, byte code index (BCI), and line number,
when available, are printed. With the -m option, the jstack
command prints both Java and native frames of all threads
with the program counter (PC). For each native frame, the
closest native symbol to PC, when available, is printed. C++
mangled names are not demangled. To demangle C++ names, the
output of this command can be piped to c++filt. When the
specified process is running on a 64-bit Java Virtual
Machine, you might need to specify the -J-d64 option, for
example: jstack -J-d64 -m pid.</p>

<p>Note: This utility is unsupported and might not be
available in future release of the JDK. In Windows Systems
where the dbgeng.dll file is not present, Debugging Tools
For Windows must be installed so these tools work. The PATH
environment variable needs to contain the location of the
jvm.dll that is used by the target process, or the location
from which the crash dump file was produced. For
example:</p>

<p>b set PATH=&lt;jdkjriin</p>

<p>OPTIONS -F Force a stack dump when jstack [-l] pid does
not respond.</p>

<p>-l Long listing. Prints additional information about
locks such as a list of owned java.util.concurrent ownable
synchronizers. See the AbstractOwnableSynchronizer class
description at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/AbstractOwnableSynchronizer.html</p>

<p>-m Prints a mixed mode stack trace that has both Java
and native C/C++ frames.</p>

<p>-h Prints a help message.</p>

<p>-help Prints a help message.</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS In mixed mode stack trace, the -m option does
not work with the remote debug server.</p>
