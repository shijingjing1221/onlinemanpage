<p>NAME conch - Conch SSH client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS conch [-AaCfINnrsTtVvx] [-c cipher_spec] [-e
escape_char] [-i identity_file] [-K connection_spec] [-L
port:host:hostport] [-l user] [-m mac_spec] [-o
openssh_option] [-p port] [-R port:host:hostport] [user@]
hostname [command]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION conch is a SSHv2 client for logging into a
remote machine and executing commands. It provides encrypted
and secure communications across a pos- sibly insecure
network. Arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over
the secure connection.</p>

<p>conch connects and logs into hostname (as user or the
current username). The user must prove her/his identity
through a public-key or a password. Alternatively, if a
connection is already open to a server, a new shell can be
opened over the connection without having to
reauthenticate.</p>

<p>If command is specified, command is executed instead of
a shell. If the -s option is given, command is treated as an
SSHv2 subsystem name.</p>

<p>Authentication Conch supports the public-key,
keyboard-interactive, and password authen- tications.</p>

<p>The public-key method allows the RSA or DSA algorithm to
be used. The client uses his/her private key,
$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa or $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa to sign the session
identifier, known only by the client and server. The server
checks that the matching public key is valid for the user,
and that the signature is correct.</p>

<p>If public-key authentication fails, conch can
authenticate by sending an encrypted password over the
connection.</p>

<p>Connection sharing conch has the ability to multiplex
multiple shells, commands and TCP/IP ports over the same
secure connection. To disable multiplexing for a connection,
use the -I flag.</p>

<p>The -K option determines how the client connects to the
remote host. It is a comma-separated list of the methods to
use, in order of preference. The two connection methods are
unix (for connecting over a multiplexed connection) and
direct (to connect directly). To disable connecting over a
multiplexed connection, do not include unix in the
preference list.</p>

<p>As an example of how connection sharing works, to speed
up CVS over SSH:</p>

<p>conch --noshell --fork -l cvs_user cvs_host set
CVS_RSH=conch</p>

<p>Now, when CVS connects to cvs_host as cvs_user, instead
of making a new connection to the server, conch will add a
new channel to the existing connection. This saves the cost
of repeatedly negotiating the cryptogra- phy and
authentication.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-A Enables authentication agent forwarding.</p>

<p>-a Disables authentication agent forwarding
(default).</p>

<p>-C Enable compression.</p>

<p>-c cipher_spec Selects encryption algorithms to be used
for this connection, as a comma-separated list of ciphers in
order of preference. The list that conch supports is (in
order of default preference): aes256-ctr, aes256-cbc,
aes192-ctr, aes192-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes128-cbc, cast128-ctr,
cast128-cbc, blowfish-ctr, blowfish, idea-ctr, idea-cbc,
3des-ctr, 3des-cbc.</p>

<p>-e ch | ^ch | none Sets the escape character for
sessions with a PTY (default: ~). The escape character is
only recognized at the beginning of a line (after a
newline). The escape character followed by a dot (.) closes
the connection; followed by ^Z suspends the connec- tion;
and followed by the escape character sends the escape char-
acter once. Setting the character to none disables any
escapes.</p>

<p>-f Fork to background after authentication.</p>

<p>-I Do not allow connection sharing over this
connection.</p>

<p>-i identity_spec The file from which the identity
(private key) for RSA or DSA authentication is read. The
defaults are $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa and $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa. It is
possible to use this option more than once to use more than
one private key.</p>

<p>-K connection_spec Selects methods for connection to the
server, as a comma-sepa- rated list of methods in order of
preference. See Connection sharing for more information.</p>

<p>-L port:host:hostport Specifies that the given port on
the client host is to be for- warded to the given host and
port on the remote side. This allo- cates a socket to listen
to port on the local side, and when con- nections are made
to that socket, they are forwarded over the secure channel
and a connection is made to host port hostport from the
remote machine. Only root can forward privieged ports.</p>

<p>-l user Log in using this username.</p>

<p>-m mac_spec Selects MAC (message authentication code)
algorithms, as a comma- separated list in order of
preference. The list that conch sup- ports is (in order of
preference): hmac-sha1, hmac-md5.</p>

<p>-N Do not execute a shell or command.</p>

<p>-n Redirect input from /dev/null.</p>

<p>-o openssh_option Ignored OpenSSH options.</p>

<p>-p port The port to connect to on the server.</p>

<p>-R port:host:hostport Specifies that the given port on
the remote host is to be for- warded to the given host and
port on the local side. This allo- cates a socket to listen
to port on the remote side, and when connections are made to
that socket, they are forwarded over the secure channel and
a connection is made to host port hostport from the client
host. Only root can forward privieged ports.</p>

<p>-s Reconnect to the server if the connection is
lost.</p>

<p>-s Invoke command (mandatory) as a SSHv2 subsystem.</p>

<p>-T Do not allocate a TTY.</p>

<p>-t Allocate a TTY even if command is given.</p>

<p>-V Display version number only.</p>

<p>-v Log to stderr.</p>

<p>-x Disable X11 connection forwarding (default).</p>
