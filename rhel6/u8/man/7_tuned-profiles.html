<p>NAME tuned-profiles - description of basic tuned
profiles</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These are the base profiles which are mostly
shipped in the base tuned package. They are targeted to
various goals. Mostly they provide per- formance
optimizations but there are also profiles targeted to low
power consumption, low latency and others. You can mostly
deduce the purpose of the profile by its name or you can see
full description bel- low.</p>

<p>The power saving profiles contain settings that are
typically not enabled by default as they will noticeably
impact the latency/perfor- mance of your system as opposed
to the power saving mechanisms we have enabled by default.
On the other hand the performance profiles disable the
additional power saving mechanisms of tuned and ktune as
they would negatively impact the performance tuning, be it
throughput or latency.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED PROFILES At the moment we re providing the
following pre defined profiles:</p>

<p>default This is the default powersaving profile. It is
the lowest of the available profiles in regard to
powersaving and only enables CPU and disk plugins of tuned.
This is not the same as tuned-adm off, where tuned and ktune
services are disabled.</p>

<p>desktop-powersave A powersaving profile directed at
desktop systems. Enables ALPM powersaving for SATA host
adapters as well as the CPU, ethernet and disk plugins of
tuned.</p>

<p>server-powersave A powersaving profile directed at
server systems. Enables ALPM powersaving for SATA host
adapters, disables CD-ROM polling via hal and activates the
CPU and disk plugins of tuned.</p>

<p>laptop-ac-powersave Medium powersaving profile directed
at laptops running on AC. Enables ALPM powersaving for SATA
host adapters, WiFi power saving as well as CPU, ethernet
and disk plugins of tuned.</p>

<p>laptop-battery-powersave Strong powersaving profile
directed at laptops running on bat- tery. It activates all
power saving mechanisms from the previous profiles plus it
enables multi core power savings scheduler for low wakeup
systems and makes sure the ondemand governor is active and
the AC97 audio power saving is enabled. This profile can be
used for any kind of system, not only laptops on battery
power in order to save the maximum amount of power. The
tradeoff for this profile is a noticeable impact on
performance, specifi- cally latency of disk and network
IO.</p>

<p>spindown-disk Strong powersaving profile enabling
aggresive disk spin-down. Disk writeback values are
increased and disk swappines is lowered. CD drives polling
and log syncing is disabled. All par- titions are remounted
with noatime option. All tuned plugins are disabled.</p>

<p>throughput-performance Server profile for typical
throughput performance tuning. Dis- ables tuned and ktune
power saving mechanisms and enables sysctl settings that
improve the throughput performance of your disk and network
IO and switches to the deadline scheduler. CPU gov- ernor is
set to performance.</p>

<p>latency-performance Server profile for typical latency
performance tuning. Disables tuned and ktune power saving
mechanisms and enables deadline IO scheduler. CPU governor
is set to performance.</p>

<p>enterprise-storage Server profile for high disk
throughput performace tuning. Dis- ables tuned and ktune
power saving mechanisms and enables dead- line IO scheduler.
Enables hugepages and disables disk barriers. Disk readahead
values are increased. CPU governor is set to per-
formance.</p>

<p>virtual-guest Profile optimized for virtual guests based
on enterprise-storage profile. It additionally decreases
virtual memory swapiness.</p>

<p>virtual-host Profile optimized for virtual hosts based
on enterprise-storage profile. It additionally decreases
virtual memory swapiness and enables more aggresive
writeback of dirty pages.</p>
