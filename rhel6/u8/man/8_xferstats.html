<p>XFERSTATS(8) XFERSTATS(8)</p>

<p>NAME xferstats - compiles information about file
transfers from logfiles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xferstats [- | + ] [-c &lt;config file&gt;] [-T
&lt;number&gt;] [[-+]C] [[-+]H] [[-+]n] [[-+]s] [[-+]r]
[[-+]a] [[-+]g] [[-+]i] [[-+]u] [[-+]h] [[-+]m] [[-+]w]
[[-+]M] [[-+]f [number]] [[-+]d [number]] [[-+]t [number]]
[[-+]O [number]] [[-+]o [number]] [+L &lt;number&gt;] [+A]
[-D &lt;number&gt;] [+D &lt;number&gt;] [+P &lt;prefix&gt;]
[+B &lt;timestamp&gt;] [+E &lt;timestamp&gt;] [-v] [--ver-
sion] [--help] [--] [filename(s)]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xferstats is a utility that parses wu-ftpd,
ncftpd, and (special) apache xferlogs (although it s not
difficult to add support for other log types) and gives
various information and totals about the data
transferred.</p>

<p>OPTIONS + The single plus tells xferstats to get the
xferlog from stdin. For example:</p>

<p>cat xferlog | xferstats +</p>

<p>- The single hyphen tells xferstats to get the xferlog
from a file. While this is the default behaviour, the
configuration file may change the default, and this option
allows you to over- ride it. For example:</p>

<p>xferstats - /var/log/xferlog</p>

<p>-c configuration file Specify an alternate path and
filename for the configuration file. The packaged default is
/etc/xferstats.cfg but your administrator may have changed
this. A new default can be set by changing the appropriate
variable in xferstats.h and recom- piling.</p>

<p>-T log type Specify the type of log file to be parsed.
Currently, only three types are defined, wu-ftpd for
wu-ftpd-style logs, ncftpd for ncftpd-style logs, and apache
for special Apache logs. Note: you can also use
&quot;wu-ftp&quot;, &quot;wuftp&quot;, &quot;wuftpd&quot;,
or &quot;ncftp&quot;. In order for xferstats to parse Apache
logfiles, you must use a special LogFile line: LogFormat
&quot;%{%a %b %d %X %Y}t %T %h %b %f %u&quot;. xferstats may
or may not support regular Apache logfiles in the future. If
this is something you want, please let me know.</p>

<p>-v, --version Display what version of xferstats youre
running.</p>

<p>--help Display a quick summary of the command line
options.</p>

<p>-- Use a -- (double hyphen) to indicate that you are
finished giv- ing parameters and will follow with a
filename. This is partic- ularly useful when you want to
specify a filename that begins with a + or -</p>

<p>TOGGLE OPTIONS The options in this section can be either
forced on with +[option] or forced off with -[option].
Options in this section, like all other options, will always
override any settings in the xferstats configura- tion file.
Any arguments to toggle options should only be used when
enabling an option. Supplying an argument when disabling an
option will generate an error.</p>

<p>C When enabled, xferstats will try to weed out corrupt
log lines by strictly checking to make sure that the data is
valid. If you --enable-debug_flow at compile time, xferstats
will notify you when corrupt lines are detected.</p>

<p>H When enabled, xferstats will generate HTML tables and
graphs instead of text tables. In order to actually generate
tables instead of broken graphic icons, you must put the
graph JPGs in the directory pointed to by the GRAPH_PATH
configuration com- mand. For more information, see the
CONFIGURATION FILE section.</p>

<p>n When enabled, xferstats will refrain from adding
&lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;BODY&gt;, and &lt;TITLE&gt; tags, so that
the output can be inserted into pages containing custom
headers.</p>

<p>s When enabled, xferstats will output HTML as a single
page (file- name &quot;xferstats.html&quot;) instead of a
page for each section. This option also disables
&lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; tags, although it does produce
a &lt;TITLE&gt; tag unless the NO_HTML_HEADERS option is
also specified.</p>

<p>r When enabled, xferstats will generate statistics about
real user connections (but not necessarily only real user
connections)</p>

<p>a When enabled, xferstats will generate statistics about
anonymous connections (but not necessarily only anonymous
connections)</p>

<p>g When enabled, xferstats will generate statistics about
guest connections (but not necessarily only guest
connections)</p>

<p>i When enabled, xferstats will generate statistics about
inbound (the product of a PUT) files (but not necessarily
only inbound files)</p>

<p>u When enabled, xferstats will generate statistics about
outbound (the product of a GET) files (but not necessarily
only outbound files)</p>

<p>h When enabled, xferstats will generate a report listing
traffic by hour</p>

<p>m When enabled, xferstats will generate a report listing
traffic by month (January, February, etc.)</p>

<p>w When enabled, xferstats will generate a report listing
traffic by day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)</p>

<p>M When enabled, xferstats will generate a report listing
traffic by day of the month (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)</p>

<p>f [number] When enabled, xferstats will generate a
report listing traffic by file. You can supply an optional
argument that will deter- mine how many file records
xferstats displays (0 (zero) disables the limit)</p>

<p>d [number] When enabled, xferstats will generate a
report listing traffic by directory. You can supply an
optional argument that will determine how many directory
records xferstats displays (0 (zero) disables the limit).
See the -D and +D options, as well as the DIR_DEPTH and
DIR_FILTER configuration commands for more information.</p>

<p>t [number] When enabled, xferstats will generate a
report listing traffic by top-level domain. You can supply
an optional argument that will determine how many TLD
records xferstats displays (0 (zero) disables the limit)</p>

<p>O [number] When enabled, xferstats will generate a
report listing traffic by domain. You can supply an optional
argument that will deter- mine how many domain records
xferstats displays (0 (zero) dis- ables the limit)</p>

<p>o [number] When enabled, xferstats will generate a
report listing traffic by host. You can supply an optional
argument that will deter- mine how many host records
xferstats displays (0 (zero) disables the limit)</p>

<p>OTHER OPTIONS +A Include all users, generate all
reports</p>

<p>+L &lt;number&gt; Limit the daily report to the last
&lt;number&gt; days</p>

<p>-D &lt;number&gt; Depth of path detail for directories
(default 3)</p>

<p>+D &lt;directory&gt; Generate reports on files located
only in &lt;directory&gt;. For example:</p>

<p>+D /pub will report only on paths under /pub. Specifying
multi- ple +D options will instruct xferstats to include
data from all specified directories.</p>

<p>+P &lt;pathprefix&gt; Strip the &lt;prefix&gt; from any
pathnames that begin with it. This is the same as specifying
a STRIP_PREFIX configuration file com- mand. Keep in mind
that the DIR_FILTER (or +D) is checked before the
STRIP_PREFIX (or +P) when using these.</p>

<p>+B &lt;timestamp&gt; Providing a +B argument instructs
xferstats to only generate data on transfers occuring after
that time. The time stamp for- mat is &quot;Jan DD HH:MM:ss
YYYY&quot;. One may combine +B and +E to generate a report
about a specific window in time.</p>

<p>+E &lt;timestamp&gt; Providing a +E argument instructs
xferstats to only generate data on transfers occuring before
that time. The time stamp format is &quot;Jan DD HH:MM:ss
YYYY&quot;. One may combine +B and +E to generate a report
about a specific window in time.</p>

<p>The default compile-time setting for the xferlog
location is /var/log/xferlog but your administrator may have
changed this. If xferstats reports an error, try specifying
the filename as the last command line parameter.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The default configuration file path
is /etc/xferstats.cfg although your administrator may have
changed this.</p>

<p>Any text after a # is ignored, as long as the # begins a
line or is prepended by whitespace.</p>

<p>Commands (LOGFILE, ANON_TRAFFIC, etc) are not case
sensitive, although some arguments may be.</p>

<p>LOGFILE &lt;filename&gt; sets the default log file to
process. It can be overridden by adding
&quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot; at the end of the command line
options. You may specify as many LOGFILE lines as you like;
they will be pro- cessed in the order specified (although
the order processed should not change the output).
Example:</p>

<p>LOGFILE /var/log/xferlog LOGFILE /var/log/xferlog.1
LOGFILE /var/log/xferlog.2</p>

<p>STRICT_CHECK takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will try to weed out corrupt log lines by strictly checking
to make sure that the data is valid. If you
--enable-debug_flow at compile time, xferstats will notify
you when corrupt lines are detected. It can be enabled with
&quot;+C&quot; or disabled with &quot;-C&quot; on the
command line.</p>

<p>ANON_TRAFFIC takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate statistics about anonymous connections (but
not necessarily only anonymous connections). It can be
enabled with &quot;+a&quot; or disabled with &quot;-a&quot;
on the command line.</p>

<p>GUEST_TRAFFIC takes no arguments. When enabled,
xferstats will generate statistics about guest connections
(but not necessarily only guest connections). This option
has no effect when parsing non- wuftpd logfiles. It can be
enabled with &quot;+g&quot; or disabled with &quot;-g&quot;
on the command line.</p>

<p>REAL_TRAFFIC takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate statistics about real user connections (but
not necessarily only real user connections). It can be
enabled with &quot;+r&quot; or disabled with &quot;-r&quot;
on the command line.</p>

<p>INBOUND takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats will
generate statistics about inbound (the product of a PUT)
files (but not necessarily only inbound files). It can be
enabled with &quot;+i&quot; or disabled with &quot;-i&quot;
on the command line.</p>

<p>OUTBOUND takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate statistics about outbound (the product of a
GET) files (but not necessarily only outbound files). It can
be enabled with &quot;+u&quot; or disabled with
&quot;-u&quot; on the command line.</p>

<p>HOURLY_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled,
xferstats will generate a report listing traffic per hour.
It can be enabled with &quot;+h&quot; or disabled with
&quot;-h&quot; on the command line.</p>

<p>DOW_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate a report listing traffic by day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, etc). It can be enabled with
&quot;+w&quot; or disabled with &quot;-w&quot; on the
command line.</p>

<p>DOM_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate a report listing traffic by day of the month
(1st, 2nd, etc). It can be enabled with &quot;+M&quot; or
disabled with &quot;-M&quot; on the command line.</p>

<p>TLD_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate a report listing traffic by top-level domain
(com, edu, net, us, uk, etc). It can be enabled with
&quot;+t &lt;number&gt;&quot; or disabled with
&quot;-t&quot; on the command line.</p>

<p>DOMAIN_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled,
xferstats will generate a report listing traffic by domain
(foo.com, blah.edu, etc). It can be enabled with &quot;+O
&lt;number&gt;&quot; or disabled with &quot;-O&quot; on the
command line.</p>

<p>HOST_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate a report listing traffic by host. It can be
enabled with &quot;+o&quot; or disabled with &quot;-o&quot;
on the command line.</p>

<p>DIR_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate a report listing traffic by directory. The
directory depth that xferstats will keep track of can be
controlled by the DIR_DEPTH configuration command or with
the &quot;-l &lt;depth&gt;&quot; command line option. It can
be enabled with &quot;+d&quot; or disabled with
&quot;-d&quot; on the command line.</p>

<p>FILE_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will generate a report listing traffic by file. It can be
enabled with &quot;+f&quot; or disabled with &quot;-f&quot;
on the command line.</p>

<p>MONTHLY_REPORT takes no arguments. When enabled,
xferstats will generate a report listing traffic per month
(January, February, etc). It can be enabled with
&quot;+m&quot; or disabled with &quot;-m&quot; on the
command line.</p>

<p>HTML_OUTPUT takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will output all reports into individual HTML files. Future
versions will con- tain a configuration option to set the
directory in which to place the HTML files. For now they are
placed in the present working# directory. It can be enabled
with &quot;+H&quot; or disabled with &quot;-H&quot; on the
command line.</p>

<p>USE_STDIN takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will, by default, read the logfile from the standard input
instead of from a file on disk. It can be enabled with
&quot;+&quot; or disabled with &quot;-&quot; on the command
line.</p>

<p>LOG_TYPE takes one argument, the type of log that will
be processed by default. The argument can be either a number
or a case insensi- tive string and are as follows:</p>

<p>wu-ftpd log: &quot;1&quot; or &quot;wu-ftp&quot; or
&quot;wu-ftpd&quot; or &quot;wuftp&quot; or
&quot;wuftpd&quot;</p>

<p>ncftpd log : &quot;2&quot; or &quot;ncftp&quot; or
&quot;ncftpd&quot;</p>

<p>Apache log : &quot;3&quot; or &quot;apache&quot;</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p>LOG_TYPE 1</p>

<p>LOG_TYPE wu-ftp</p>

<p>LOG_TYPE wu-ftpd</p>

<p>LOG_TYPE wuftp</p>

<p>LOG_TYPE wuftpd</p>

<p>are all equivalent.</p>

<p>Future versions will contain support for additional
logfile types. It can be set on the command line with
&quot;-T &lt;number&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>DIR_DEPTH takes one argument, the number of
subdirectories deep that xfer- stats should go when
generating statistics by directory. This configuration
command has no effect when DIR_REPORT has not been enabled.
DIR_DEPTH has no upper bound. A DIR_DEPTH of 0 (zero) tells
xferstats to process all subdirectories. The default value
is 3. It can be set on the command line with &quot;-D
&lt;number&gt;&quot;. Example:</p>

<p>DIR_DEPTH 3</p>

<p>DIR_FILTER takes one argument, the directory that
xferstats should report on. xferstats will discard any data
that does not have a path that begins with the value set by
DIR_FILTER. This value is case-sensitive, as it is part of a
path name. Specifying multi- ple statements will instruct
xferstats to include data from all specified directories. It
can be set on the command line with &quot;+D
&lt;path&gt;&quot;. Example:</p>

<p>DIR_FILTER /pub/foobar</p>

<p>NUMBER_FILE_STATS takes one argument, the number of
files to report on in the file statistics section. It must
be a number greater than or equal to zero, with zero
denoting no limit. It can be set on the com- mand line with
&quot;+f &lt;number&gt;&quot;. The default is 50.</p>

<p>NUMBER_FILE_STATS 50</p>

<p>NUMBER_DIR_STATS takes one argument, the number of
directories to report on in the directory statistics
section. It must be a number greater than or equal to zero,
with zero denoting no limit. It can be set on the command
line with &quot;+d &lt;number&gt;&quot;. The default is
50.</p>

<p>NUMBER_DAILY_STATS takes one argument, the number of
days to report on in the daily statistics section. It must
be a number greater than or equal to zero, with zero
denoting no limit. It can be set on the com- mand line with
&quot;+L &lt;number&gt;&quot;. The default is 50.</p>

<p>Note: the daily statistics section will always be
displayed.</p>

<p>NUMBER_TLD_STATS takes one argument, the number of
top-level domains to report on in the TLD statistics
section. It must be a number greater than or equal to zero,
with zero denoting no limit. It can be set on the command
line with &quot;+t &lt;number&gt;&quot;. The default is
50.</p>

<p>NUMBER_DOMAIN_STATS takes one argument, the number of
top-level domains to report on in the domain statistics
section. It must be a number greater than or equal to zero,
with zero denoting no limit. It can be set on the command
line with &quot;+O &lt;number&gt;&quot;. The default is
50.</p>

<p>NUMBER_HOST_STATS takes one argument, the number of
hosts to report on in the host statistics section. It must
be a number greater than or equal to zero, with zero
denoting no limit. It can be set on the com- mand line with
&quot;+o &lt;number&gt;&quot;. The default is 50.</p>

<p>MAX_REPORT_SIZE takes one argument, the maximum size of
any one output table. This is particularly useful to keep
xferstats from generating gigantic tables that make
graphical browsers choke. It will split tables to be no
larger than# this value. It must be greater than or equal to
ten, or zero, zero denoting no limit. It can be set on the
command line with &quot;+R &lt;number&gt;&quot;. The default
is 30.</p>

<p>GRAPH_PATH takes one argument, the location of the JPGs
used to draw graphs in the HTML output. It can be an
absolute path (ie, http://foo.bar.com/graphs/) or a relative
path (ie, ../graphs/). You must include a trailing / or it
will not work. This option cannot be set on the command
line. The default is noth- ing (which will make the browser
look for the graphs in the directory with the HTML).
Example:</p>

<p>GRAPH_PATH ../graphs/</p>

<p>NO_HTML_HEADERS takes no arguments. When enabled,
xferstats will refrain from adding &lt;HTML&gt;,
&lt;BODY&gt;, and &lt;TITLE&gt; tags, so that the output can
be inserted into pages containing custom headers. It can be
enabled with &quot;+n&quot; or disabled with &quot;-n&quot;
on the command line.</p>

<p>REFRESH takes one argument, the number of seconds after
being displayed that the browser should refresh it.
Unspecified or zero indi- cates no refresh.</p>

<p>SINGLE_PAGE takes no arguments. When enabled, xferstats
will output HTML as a single page (entitled
&quot;xferstats.html&quot;) instead of a page for each
section. This option also disables &lt;HTML&gt; and
&lt;BODY&gt; tags, although it does produce a &lt;TITLE&gt;
tag unless the NO_HTML_HEAD- ERS option is also specified.
It can be enabled with &quot;+s&quot; or disabled with
&quot;-s&quot; on the command line.</p>

<p>STRIP_PREFIX takes one argument. When specified,
xferstats will strip the given string from the beginning of
any paths. Keep in mind when using this option with
DIR_FILTER that the DIR_FILTER is applied -before-
stripping, so that you must take this into account when
specifying the DIR_FILTER string. This option cannot be set
on the command line. Example:</p>

<p>STRIP_PREFIX /home/ftp</p>

<p>The next 11 entries are all basically the same--they
define how the reports are to be sorted.</p>

<p>0 -- Sort by the number of bytes downloaded</p>

<p>1 -- Sort by the number of files downloaded</p>

<p>2 -- Sort by the &quot;name&quot;. This varies by
report; for the file, directory, TLD, etc reports, it sorts
them alphabetically; for the file size report it lists the
file sizes in alphabetical order; for the daily report, it
lists the days in order. You get the idea. 3 -- Sort by
average throughput, in K/s</p>

<p>FILE_SORT_PREF, DIR_SORT_PREF, DOMAIN_SORT_PREF,
TLD_SORT_PREF, HOST_SORT_PREF, DOM_SORT_PREF, DOW_SORT_PREF,
HOURLY_SORT_PREF, DAILY_SORT_PREF, SIZE_SORT_PREF,
MONTHLY_SORT_PREF</p>

<p>CHUNK_INPUT takes one argument. When specified,
xferstats will parse the logfiles in chunks of the given
size (in number of lines), process them, and continue. This
will keep it from trying to parse the entire log at once,
using up a lot of memory for large logs. Specifying too
small a value will cause xferstats to waste a lot of time
switching tasks, while too large a value may slow it down as
your system swaps. Toy with this value a bit and see what
works best for you. If left unspecified, xferstats will
continue to parse the logs in one pass.</p>

<p>FILES xferlog (generated by wu-ftpd or ncftpd)</p>

<p>/etc/xferstats.cfg contains all of the default settings
and many set- tings which cannot be set from the command
line.</p>

<p>If you installed the RPM version of xferstats, youll
find the JPGs for the graphs in
/usr/share/xferstats/graphs.</p>

<p>BUGS The JPG graph pieces included are not ideal;
sometimes artifacts show up. I will eventually get around to
making new GIFs or something.</p>

<p>Please send bug reports to phil@off.net If the xferlog
that youre using is smaller than 1 megabyte, please send a
gzipped copy, along with the exact parameters youre
using.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I greatly appreciate the suggestions
and assistance of Nat Friedman &lt;ndf@mit.edu&gt;.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mike Shaver &lt;shaver@mozilla.org&gt; and
Jamie Zawinski &lt;jwz@netscape.com&gt; for coughing up
gigantic mozilla.org logs to aid my testing.</p>

<p>Thanks to Phil Copeland &lt;bryce@zen.ics.uwe.ac.uk&gt;
for getting on my back constantly to add new stuff, fix
nagging bugs, and speed it up. Oh, and for using it, at
least someone does :).</p>

<p>Extreme gratitude to Mark Hagler
&lt;hagler@hagler.org&gt;, someone whom Ive left off of this
list for too long. Mark was kind enough to Amazon me a copy
of OReillys _Pthreads Programming_ which was the catalyst
for the threaded version and really helped get me interested
in the project again. While the threaded version doesnt
exist anymore, the book is still terribly useful for other
projects.</p>
