<p>jsadebugd(1) Troubleshooting Tools jsadebugd(1)</p>

<p>NAME jsadebugd - Attaches to a Java process or core file
and acts as a debug server. This command is experimental and
unsupported.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jsadebugd pid [ server-id ]</p>

<p>jsadebugd executable core [ server-id ]</p>

<p>pid The process ID of the process to which the debug
server attaches. The process must be a Java process. To get
a list of Java processes running on a machine, use the
jps(1) command. At most one instance of the debug server can
be attached to a single process.</p>

<p>executable The Java executable from which the core dump
was produced.</p>

<p>core The core file to which the debug server should
attach.</p>

<p>server-id An optional unique ID that is needed when
multiple debug servers are started on the same machine. This
ID must be used by remote clients to identify the particular
debug server to which to attach. Within a single machine,
this ID must be unique.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jsadebugd command attaches to a Java
process or core file and acts as a debug server. Remote
clients such as jstack, jmap, and jinfo can attach to the
server through Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Before
you start the jsadebugd command, start the RMI registry with
the rmiregistry command as follows where $JAVA_HOME is the
JDK installation directory:</p>

<p>rmiregistry
-J-Xbootclasspath/p:$JAVA_HOME/lib/sajdi.jar</p>

<p>If the RMI registry was not started, then the jsadebugd
command starts an RMI registry in a standard (1099) port
internally. The debug server can be stopped by sending a
SIGINT to it. To send a SIGINT press Ctrl+C.</p>

<p>Note: This utility is unsupported and may or may not be
available in future releases of the JDK. In Windows Systems
where dbgeng.dll is not present, Debugging Tools For Windows
must be installed to have these tools working. The PATH
environment variable should contain the location of jvm.dll
used by the target process or the location from which the
crash dump file was produced. For example, setb
PATH=%JDK_HOMEjriinSEE ALSO &middot; jinfo(1)</p>
