<p>NAME xsetwacom - commandline utility to query and modify
wacom driver set- tings.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xsetwacom [options] [command [arguments]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program queries or changes properties
on the devices loaded by the wacom driver. The modification
of properties happens at runtime and is not persistent
through X server restarts.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS -d, --display display_name Connect to
the X server specified in display_name; see X(7).</p>

<p>-h, --help Prints a short help.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Enable verbose output, useful for
debugging.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Allowed commands are list, get, and set. The
command may be specified with or without one or two
preceding dashes, i.e. --list is equivalent to -list and
list.</p>

<p>LIST COMMANDS list devices List known devices. Only
input devices managed by the wacom driver are listed.</p>

<p>list parameters List known parameters. List all
parameters suitable for the get or the set command. Note
that not all parameters are available on all device
types.</p>

<p>list modifiers List the aliases for modifiers and other
keys that can be used when setting button action
mappings.</p>

<p>GET COMMANDS get device_name parameter Get the current
settings for the parameter on the given device. Note that
not all parameters are available on all device types. The
special parameter name &quot;all&quot; may be provided to
display all current settings on the device.</p>

<p>By default, options are printed on the commandline in
the respective format. The output format may be altered with
one of the following options:</p>

<p>-s, --shell Display the output in shell format, i.e. as
shell commands to xsetwacom to reproduce the same
parameter.</p>

<p>-x, --xconf Display the output in xorg.conf format, i.e.
as option lines that may be added to the InputDevice section
in the xorg.conf.</p>

<p>SET COMMANDS set device_name parameter [value] Set the
parameter value on the given device to the value pro- vided.
Note that not all parameters are writable, some are read-
only and result in an error when trying to be modified.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Not all parameters are available on all
tools. Use the get command with the parameter or
&quot;all&quot; parameter for specific input tool applica-
ble parameters and current settings.</p>

<p>Area x1 y1 x2 y2 Set the tablet input area in device
coordinates in the form top left x/y and bottom right x/y.
Top left and bottom right are defined in the device s native
orientation, regardless of the actual rotation currently
applied. Input outside of these coor- dinates will be
clipped to the edges of the area defined. Default: 0 0 x2
y2; with x2 and y2 tablet specific.</p>

<p>Button button-number [mapping] Set a mapping for the
specified button-number. Mappings take the form of either a
single numeric button or an action to be per- formed. If no
mapping is provided, the default mapping is restored.</p>

<p>Numeric button mappings indicate what X11 button number
the given button-number should correspond to. For example, a
mapping of &quot;3&quot; means a press of the given
button-number will produce a press of X11 button 3 (i.e.
right click).</p>

<p>Action mappings allow button presses to perform many
events. They take the form of a string of keywords and
arguments.</p>

<p>The &quot;key&quot; keyword is following by a list of
key names. These can optionally be preceded by &quot;+&quot;
for press and &quot;-&quot; for release. If +/- is not
given, press-and-release is assumed, except for modi- fier
keys which are left pressed. Key names can be X11 KeySyms or
some aliases such as shift or f1 (the full list can be seen
with the list modifiers command).</p>

<p>For example, &quot;key +a +shift b -shift -a&quot;
converts the button into a series of keystrokes, in this
example &quot;press a, press shift, press and release b,
release shift, release a&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;button&quot; keyword is similar except that
its arguments are X11 button numbers.</p>

<p>The &quot;modetoggle&quot; keyword is also recognized;
it takes no argu- ments, and toggles the device mode between
relative and absolute pointer tracking.</p>

<p>The events in the action mapping are sent when the
physical but- ton is pressed. If the action mapping leaves
any buttons or keys pressed (such as a modifier key), they
will be released when the physical button is released.</p>

<p>Multiple keywords may be present in one action if
desired: for example &quot;key +ctrl button 5 key
-ctrl&quot;. Each keyword takes all arguments until the next
keyword.</p>

<p>A maximum of 256 presses and/or releases can be
specified in an action mapping.</p>

<p>The driver can only simulate physical key events but not
keysyms and xsetwacom translates the mapping sequence into
such events. Thus, symbols on the same physical key will
generate the same event. For example, 1 and ! are on the
same key on a US key- board and thus have the same keycode).
For access to keys on a higher shift level, the sequence
should be entered as it would be typed on a physical
keyboard. For example, a exclamation mark is entered by the
sequence of &quot;key +shift 1 -shift&quot;.</p>

<p>BindToSerial [serial|0] Bind the device to the tool with
the specified serial number. Once bound, the device will
ignore events from other tools. A serial of 0 means the
device is unbound and will react to any tool of the matching
type. Default: 0</p>

<p>MapToOutput [output] Map the tablet s input area to a
given output (e.g. &quot;VGA1&quot;). Output names may
either be the name of a head available through the XRandR
extension, or an X11 geometry string of the form
WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y. To switch to the next available output,
the &quot;next&quot; keyword is also supported. This will
cycle between the individual monitors connected to the
system, and then the entire desktop. The mapping may be
reset to the entire desktop at any time with the output name
&quot;desktop&quot;. Users of the NVIDIA binary driver
should use the output names &quot;HEAD-0&quot; and
&quot;HEAD-1&quot; until the driver supports XRandR 1.2 or
later.</p>

<p>The output mapping configuration is a onetime setting
and does not track output reconfigurations; the command
needs to be re- run whenever the output configuration
changes. When used with tablet rotation, the tablet must be
rotated before it is mapped to the new screen. This
parameter is write-only and cannot be queried.</p>

<p>Mode Absolute|Relative Set the device mode as either
Relative or Absolute. Relative means pointer tracking for
the device will function like a mouse, whereas Absolute
means the pointer corresponds to the devices actual position
on the tablet or tablet PC screen. Default: Absolute for
stylus, eraser and tablet PC touch; Rela- tive for cursor
and tablet touch.</p>

<p>PressureCurve x1 y1 x2 y2 A Bezier curve of third order,
composed of two anchor points (0,0 and 100,100) and two user
modifiable control points that define the curve s shape.
Raise the curve (x1&lt;y1 x2&lt;y2) to &quot;soften&quot;
the feel and lower the curve (x1&gt;y1 x2&gt;y2) for a
&quot;firmer&quot; feel. Sigmoid shaped curves are permitted
(x1&gt;y1 x2&lt;y2 or x1&lt;y1 x2&gt;y2). Default: 0 0 100
100, a linear curve; range of 0 to 100 for all four
values.</p>

<p>RawSample level Set the sample window size (a sliding
average sampling window) for incoming input tool raw data
points. Default: 4, range of 1 to 20.</p>

<p>Rotate none|half|cw|ccw Set the tablet to the given
rotation: none: the tablet is not rotated and uses its
natural rotation half: the tablet is rotated by 180 degrees
(upside-down) cw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees clockwise
ccw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise</p>

<p>Rotation is a tablet-wide option: rotation of one tool
affects all other tools associated with the same tablet.
When the tablet is physically rotated, rotate any tool to
the corresponding ori- entation. Default: none</p>

<p>Suppress level Set the delta (difference) cutoff level
for further processing of incoming input tool coordinate
values. For example a X or Y coordinate event will be sent
only if the change between the current X or Y coordinate and
the previous one is greater than the Suppress value. The
same applies to pressure level (Z coor- dinate) and Tilt
rotation values. With a current absolute wheel (AbsWheel) or
Tilt value the delta between it and the previous value must
be equal to or greater than the Suppress value in order to
be sent on. Suppress is a tablet wide parameter. A specified
delta level for one input tool is applied to all input tool
coordinates. To disable suppression use a level of 0.
Default: 2, range of 0 to 100.</p>

<p>TabletDebugLevel level Set the debug level for this
tablet to the given level. This only affects code paths that
are shared between several tools on the same physical
tablet. A higher level means more fine-grained debug
messages, a level of 0 turns debugging off for this tool.
Requires the driver to be built with debugging enabled. See
also ToolDebugLevel. Default: 0, range of 0 to 12.</p>

<p>TabletPCButton on|off If on, the stylus must be in
contact with the screen for a sty- lus side button to work.
If off, stylus buttons will work once the stylus is in
proximity of the tablet (regardless of whether it is
touching the screen). Default: on for Tablet PCs; off for
all other models.</p>

<p>ToolSerialPrevious Get the serial number of the tool
that was last in proximity last. This serial number is
updated whenever the tool goes out of proximity. If the
current tool went out of proximity once, this serial number
is the one of the current tool. This is a read-only
parameter.</p>

<p>Touch on|off If on, touch events are reported to
userland, i.e., system cur- sor moves when user touches the
tablet. If off, touch events are ignored. Default: on for
devices that support touch; off for all other models.</p>

<p>HWTouchSwitchState on|off If on, it means touch switch
is turned off. That is, touch events are reported to
userland. If off, touch switch is turned on, i.e., touch
events are ignored. This is a read-only parame- ter. Initial
touch switch state is retrieved from the kernel when X
driver starts.</p>

<p>CursorProximity distance sets the max distance from
tablet to stop reporting movement for cursor in relative
mode. Default for Intuos series is 10, for Graphire series
(including Volitos) is 42. Only available for the
cursor/puck device.</p>

<p>Threshold level Set the minimum pressure necessary to
generate a Button event for the stylus tip, eraser, or
touch. The pressure levels of all tablets are normalized to
2048 levels irregardless of the actual hardware supported
levels. This parameter is independent of the PressureCurve
parameter. Default: 27, range of 0 to 2047.</p>

<p>ToolDebugLevel level Set the debug level for this tool
to the given level. This only affects code paths that are
specific to a given tool. A higher level means more
fine-grained debug messages, a level of 0 turns debugging
off for this tool. Requires the driver to be built with
debugging enabled. See also TabletDebugLevel. Default: 0,
range of 0 to 12.</p>

<p>PressureRecalibration on|off If the initial pressure of
a device is != 0 the driver recali- brates the pressure
range. This is to account for worn out devices. The downside
is that when the user hits the tablet very hard the initial
pressure reading may be unequal to zero even for a perfectly
good pen. If the consecutive pressure read- ings are not
higher than the initial pressure by a threshold no button
event will be generated. This option allows to disable the
recalibration. Default: on</p>
