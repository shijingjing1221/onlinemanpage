<p>NAME .k5identity - Kerberos V5 client principal
selection rules</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The .k5identity file, which resides in a
user s home directory, con- tains a list of rules for
selecting a client principals based on the server being
accessed. These rules are used to choose a credential cache
within the cache collection when possible.</p>

<p>Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored. Each
line has the form:</p>

<p>principal field=value ...</p>

<p>If the server principal meets all of the field
constraints, then prin- cipal is chosen as the client
principal. The following fields are rec- ognized:</p>

<p>realm If the realm of the server principal is known, it
is matched against value, which may be a pattern using shell
wildcards. For host-based server principals, the realm will
generally only be known if there is a domain_realm section
in krb5.conf with a mapping for the hostname.</p>

<p>service If the server principal is a host-based
principal, its service component is matched against value,
which may be a pattern using shell wildcards.</p>

<p>host If the server principal is a host-based principal,
its hostname component is converted to lower case and
matched against value, which may be a pattern using shell
wildcards.</p>

<p>If the server principal matches the constraints of
multiple lines in the .k5identity file, the principal from
the first matching line is used. If no line matches,
credentials will be selected some other way, such as the
realm heuristic or the current primary cache.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example .k5identity file selects
the client principal alice@KRBTEST.COM if the server
principal is within that realm, the principal
alice/root@EXAMPLE.COM if the server host is within a
servers subdomain, and the principal alice/mail@EXAMPLE.COM
when accessing the IMAP service on mail.example.com.</p>

<p>alice@KRBTEST.COM realm=KRBTEST.COM
alice/root@EXAMPLE.COM host=*.servers.example.com
alice/mail@EXAMPLE.COM host=mail.example.com
service=imap</p>
