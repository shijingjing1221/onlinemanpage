<p>selabel_x(5) SELinux API documentation selabel_x(5)</p>

<p>NAME selabel_x - userspace SELinux labeling interface: X
Window System con- texts backend.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;selinux/selinux.h&gt;</p>

<p>#include &lt;selinux/label.h&gt;</p>

<p>int selabel_lookup(struct selabel_handle *hnd,
security_context_t *context,</p>

<p>const char *object_name, int object_type);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The X contexts backend maps from X Window
System object names into security contexts. It is used to
find the appropriate context for X Window System objects
whose significance and/or usage semantics are determined
primarily by name. This backend is also used to determine
the default context for labeling remotely connected X
clients.</p>

<p>The object_type argument should be set to one of the
following values:</p>

<p>SELABEL_X_PROP The object_name argument specifies the
name of a window prop- erty, such as
&quot;WM_NAME&quot;.</p>

<p>SELABEL_X_SELN The object_name argument specifies the
name of a selection, such as &quot;PRIMARY&quot;.</p>

<p>SELABEL_X_EXT The object_name argument specifies the
name of a protocol exten- sion, such as
&quot;RENDER&quot;.</p>

<p>SELABEL_X_EVENT The object_name argument specifies the
name of an event type, such as
&quot;X11:ButtonPress&quot;.</p>

<p>SELABEL_X_CLIENT The object_name argument is ignored and
should be set to NULL. The default context for labeling
remote X clients is returned.</p>

<p>SELABEL_X_POLYPROP Like SELABEL_X_PROP, but checks if
the property was marked as being polyinstantiated. See NOTES
below.</p>

<p>SELABEL_X_POLYSELN Like SELABEL_X_SELN, but checks if
the selection was marked as being polyinstantiated. See
NOTES below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS In addition to the global options described in
selabel_open(3), this backend recognizes the following
options:</p>

<p>SELABEL_OPT_PATH A non-null value for this option
specifies a path to a file that will be opened in lieu of
the standard X contexts file.</p>

<p>NOTES Properties and selections are marked as either
polyinstantiated or not. For these name types, the
&quot;POLY&quot; option searches only the names marked as
being polyinstantiated, while the other option searches only
the names marked as not being polyinstantiated. Users of the
interface should check both mappings, optionally taking
action based on the result (e.g. polyinstantiating the
object).</p>
