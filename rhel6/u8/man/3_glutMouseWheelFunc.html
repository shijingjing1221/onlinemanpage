<p>NAME glutMouseWheelFunc - Sets the mouse wheel callback
for the current win- dow.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutMouseWheelFunc(void( *callback )( int wheel,
int direction, int x, int y ));</p>

<p>PARAMETERS callback Client hook for mouse wheel
events.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the mouse wheel is spun over your
(sub)window, OpenGLUT will, in the- ory, report this via the
MouseWheel callback. wheel is the wheel num- ber, direction
is +/- 1, and x and y are the mouse coordinates.</p>

<p>If you do not register a wheel callback, wheel events
will be reported as mouse buttons.</p>

<p>This callback is bound to the current window .</p>

<p>CAVEATS Due to lack of information about the mouse, it
is impossible to implement this correctly on X at this time.
Use of this function limits the porta- bility of your
application. (This feature does work on X, just not
reliably.) You are encouraged to use the standard, reliable
mouse-button reporting, rather than wheel events.</p>

<p>Windows created via glutCreateMenuWindow() always
cascade keyboard and mouse events to their parent.</p>
