<p>NAME Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler,
Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler - asso- ciate procedure
callback with ClientMessage type X events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler(proc)</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler(proc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_ClientMessageProc *proc (in) Procedure to
invoke whenever a ClientMessage X event occurs on any
display.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler arranges for
proc to be invoked in the future whenever a ClientMessage X
event occurs that is not handled by WM_PROTOCOL.
Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler is intended for use by
applications which need to watch X ClientMessage events,
such as drag and drop applications.</p>

<p>The callback to proc will be made by Tk_HandleEvent;
this mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events
through Tk_HandleEvent (or through other Tk procedures that
call Tk_HandleEvent, such as Tk_DoOneEvent or
Tk_MainLoop).</p>

<p>Proc should have arguments and result that match the
type Tk_ClientMes- sageProc: typedef int
Tk_ClientMessageProc( Tk_Window tkwin, XEvent *eventPtr);
The tkwin parameter to proc is the Tk window which is
associated with this event. EventPtr is a pointer to the X
event.</p>

<p>Whenever an X ClientMessage event is processed by
Tk_HandleEvent, the proc is called if it was not handled as
a WM_PROTOCOL. The return value from proc is normally 0. A
non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be
handled further; that is, proc has done all pro- cessing
that is to be allowed for the event.</p>

<p>If there are multiple ClientMessage event handlers, each
one is called for each event, in the order in which they
were established.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler may be called to delete a
previously-cre- ated ClientMessage event handler: it deletes
each handler it finds that matches the proc argument. If no
such handler exists, then Tk_Delete- ClientMessageHandler
returns without doing anything. Although Tk sup- ports it,
its probably a bad idea to have more than one callback with
the same proc argument.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS bind, callback, event, handler</p>
