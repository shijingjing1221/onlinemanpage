<p>A64L(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual A64L(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME a64l, l64a - convert between a 32-bit integer and a
radix-64 ASCII string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>long a64l(const char *s); char *l64a(long value);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions maintain numbers stored in
radix-64 ASCII characters. This is a notation by which
32-bit integers can be represented by up to six characters;
each character represents a digit in radix-64 notation. If
the type long contains more than 32 bits, only the low-order
32 bits shall be used for these operations.</p>

<p>The characters used to represent digits are.(dot) for 0,
/ for 1, 0through9for [2,11], A through Z for [12,37], and a
throughzfor [38,63].</p>

<p>The a64l() function shall take a pointer to a radix-64
representation, in which the first digit is the least
significant, and return the cor- responding long value. If
the string pointed to by s contains more than six
characters, a64l() shall use the first six. If the first six
char- acters of the string contain a null terminator, a64l()
shall use only characters preceding the null terminator. The
a64l() function shall scan the character string from left to
right with the least significant digit on the left, decoding
each character as a 6-bit radix-64 number. If the type long
contains more than 32 bits, the resulting value is
sign-extended. The behavior of a64l() is unspecified if s is
a null pointer or the string pointed to by s was not
generated by a previous call to l64a().</p>

<p>The l64a() function shall take a long argument and
return a pointer to the corresponding radix-64
representation. The behavior of l64a() is unspecified if
value is negative.</p>

<p>The value returned by l64a() may be a pointer into a
static buffer. Subsequent calls to l64a() may overwrite the
buffer.</p>

<p>The l64a() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, a64l() shall
return the long value result- ing from conversion of the
input string. If a string pointed to by s is an empty
string, a64l() shall return 0L.</p>

<p>The l64a() function shall return a pointer to the
radix-64 representa- tion. If value is 0L, l64a() shall
return a pointer to an empty string.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the type long contains more than 32
bits, the result of a64l(l64a(x)) is x in the low-order 32
bits.</p>

<p>RATIONALE This is not the same encoding as used by
either encoding variant of the uuencode utility.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
