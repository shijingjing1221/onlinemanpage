<p>RENICE(1) BSD General Commands Manual RENICE(1)</p>

<p>NAME renice - alter priority of running processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS renice [-n] priority [[-p] pid ...] [[-g] pgrp
...] [[-u] user ...] renice -h | -v</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Renice alters the scheduling priority of one
or more running processes. The following who parameters are
interpreted as process IDs, process group IDs, or user
names. Reniceing a process group causes all pro- cesses in
the process group to have their scheduling priority altered.
Renice ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to
have their scheduling priority altered. By default, the
processes to be affected are specified by their process
IDs.</p>

<p>Options supported by renice:</p>

<p>-n, --priority The scheduling priority of the process,
process group, or user.</p>

<p>-g, --pgrp Force who parameters to be interpreted as
process group IDs.</p>

<p>-u, --user Force the who parameters to be interpreted as
user names.</p>

<p>-p, --pid Resets the who interpretation to be (the
default) process IDs.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print version.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32</p>

<p>would change the priority of process IDs 987 and 32, and
all processes owned by users daemon and root.</p>

<p>Users other than the super-user may only alter the
priority of processes they own, and can only monotonically
increase their nice value within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX
(20). (This prevents overriding administrative fiats.) The
super-user may alter the priority of any process and set the
priority to any value in the range PRIO_MIN (-20) to
PRIO_MAX. Useful priorities are: 20 (the affected processes
will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0
(the base scheduling priority), any- thing negative (to make
things go very fast).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd to map user names to user IDs</p>

<p>SEE ALSO getpriority(2), setpriority(2)</p>

<p>BUGS Non super-users can not increase scheduling
priorities of their own pro- cesses, even if they were the
ones that decreased the priorities in the first place. The
Linux kernel (at least version 2.0.0) and linux libc (at
least ver- sion 5.2.18) does not agree entirely on what the
specifics of the system- call interface to set nice values
is. Thus causes renice to report bogus previous nice
values.</p>

<p>HISTORY The renice command appeared in 4.0BSD.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The renice command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
