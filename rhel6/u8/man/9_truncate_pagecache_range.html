<p>TRUNCATE_PAGECACHE_R(9) Memory Management in Linux
TRUNCATE_PAGECACHE_R(9)</p>

<p>NAME truncate_pagecache_range - unmap and remove
pagecache that is hole-punched</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void truncate_pagecache_range(struct inode *
inode, loff_t lstart, loff_t lend);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS inode inode</p>

<p>lstart offset of beginning of hole</p>

<p>lend offset of last byte of hole</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function should typically be called
before the filesystem releases resources associated with the
freed range (eg. deallocates blocks). This way, pagecache
will always stay logically coherent with on-disk format, and
the filesystem would not have to deal with situations such
as writepage being called for a page that has already had
its underlying blocks deallocated.</p>
