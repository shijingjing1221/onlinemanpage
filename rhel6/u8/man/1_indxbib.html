<p>NAME indxbib - make inverted index for bibliographic
databases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS indxbib [ -vw ] [ -cfile ] [ -ddir ] [ -ffile ]
[ -hn ] [ -istring ] [ -kn ] [ -ln ] [ -nn ] [ -ofile ] [
-tn ] [ filename... ]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION indxbib makes an inverted index for the
bibliographic databases in filename... for use with
refer(1), lookbib(1), and lkbib(1). The index will be named
filename.i; the index is written to a temporary file which
is then renamed to this. If no filenames are given on the
command line because the -f option has been used, and no -o
option is given, the index will be named Ind.i.</p>

<p>Bibliographic databases are divided into records by
blank lines. Within a record, each fields starts with a %
character at the beginning of a line. Fields have a one
letter name which follows the % charac- ter.</p>

<p>The values set by the -c, -n, -l and -t options are
stored in the index; when the index is searched, keys will
be discarded and truncated in a manner appropriate to these
options; the original keys will be used for verifying that
any record found using the index actually con- tains the
keys. This means that a user of an index need not know
whether these options were used in the creation of the
index, provided that not all the keys to be searched for
would have been discarded dur- ing indexing and that the
user supplies at least the part of each key that would have
remained after being truncated during indexing. The value
set by the -i option is also stored in the index and will be
used in verifying records found using the index.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Print the version number.</p>

<p>-w Index whole files. Each file is a separate
record.</p>

<p>-cfile Read the list of common words from file instead
of /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/eign.</p>

<p>-ddir Use dir as the pathname of the current working
directory to store in the index, instead of the path printed
by pwd(1). Usu- ally dir will be a symbolic link that points
to the directory printed by pwd(1).</p>

<p>-ffile Read the files to be indexed from file. If file
is -, files will be read from the standard input. The -f
option can be given at most once.</p>

<p>-istring Dont index the contents of fields whose names
are in string. Initially string is XYZ.</p>

<p>-hn Use the first prime greater than or equal to n for
the size of the hash table. Larger values of n will usually
make searching faster, but will make the index larger and
indxbib use more mem- ory. Initially n is 997.</p>

<p>-kn Use at most n keys per input record. Initially n is
100.</p>

<p>-ln Discard keys that are shorter than n. Initially n is
3.</p>

<p>-nn Discard the n most common words. Initially n is
100.</p>

<p>-obasename The index should be named basename.i.</p>

<p>-tn Truncate keys to n. Initially n is 6.</p>

<p>FILES filename.i Index.</p>

<p>Ind.i Default index name.</p>

<p>/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/eign List of common words.</p>

<p>indxbibXXXXXX Temporary file.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO refer(1), lkbib(1), lookbib(1)</p>
