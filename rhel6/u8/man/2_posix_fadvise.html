<p>POSIX_FADVISE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
POSIX_FADVISE(2)</p>

<p>NAME posix_fadvise - predeclare an access pattern for
file data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600 #include
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_fadvise(int fd, off_t offset, off_t len, int
advice);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Programs can use posix_fadvise() to announce
an intention to access file data in a specific pattern in
the future, thus allowing the kernel to perform appropriate
optimizations.</p>

<p>The advice applies to a (not necessarily existent)
region starting at offset and extending for len bytes (or
until the end of the file if len is 0) within the file
referred to by fd. The advice is not binding; it merely
constitutes an expectation on behalf of the application.</p>

<p>Permissible values for advice include:</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_NORMAL Indicates that the application has no
advice to give about its access pattern for the specified
data. If no advice is given for an open file, this is the
default assumption.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL The application expects to access
the specified data sequen- tially (with lower offsets read
before higher ones).</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_RANDOM The specified data will be accessed in
random order.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE The specified data will be accessed
only once.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED The specified data will be accessed
in the near future.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED The specified data will not be
accessed in the near future.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, an
error number is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF The fd argument was not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid value was specified for advice.</p>

<p>ESPIPE The specified file descriptor refers to a pipe or
FIFO. (Linux actually returns EINVAL in this case.)</p>

<p>VERSIONS posix_fadvise() appeared in kernel 2.5.60.
Glibc support has been pro- vided since version 2.2.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001. Note that the type of the
len argument was changed from size_t to off_t in
POSIX.1-2003 TC1.</p>

<p>NOTES Under Linux, POSIX_FADV_NORMAL sets the readahead
window to the default size for the backing device;
POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL doubles this size, and
POSIX_FADV_RANDOM disables file readahead entirely. These
changes affect the entire file, not just the specified
region (but other open file handles to the same file are
unaffected).</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED initiates a non-blocking read of the
specified region into the page cache. The amount of data
read may be decreased by the kernel depending on virtual
memory load. (A few megabytes will usually be fully
satisfied, and more is rarely useful.)</p>

<p>In kernels before 2.6.18, POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE had the
same semantics as POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED. This was probably a
bug; since kernel 2.6.18, this flag is a no-op.</p>

<p>POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED attempts to free cached pages
associated with the specified region. This is useful, for
example, while streaming large files. A program may
periodically request the kernel to free cached data that has
already been used, so that more useful cached pages are not
discarded instead.</p>

<p>Pages that have not yet been written out will be
unaffected, so if the application wishes to guarantee that
pages will be released, it should call fsync(2) or
fdatasync(2) first.</p>

<p>BUGS In kernels before 2.6.6, if len was specified as 0,
then this was interpreted literally as &quot;zero
bytes&quot;, rather than as meaning &quot;all bytes through
to the end of the file&quot;.</p>
