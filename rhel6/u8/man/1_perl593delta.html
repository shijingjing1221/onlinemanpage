<p>PERL593DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL593DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl593delta - what is new for perl v5.9.3</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.9.2 and the 5.9.3 development releases. See
perl590delta, perl591delta and perl592delta for the
differences between 5.8.0 and 5.9.2.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes Parsing of &quot;-f _&quot; The
identifier &quot;_&quot; is now forced to be a bareword
after a filetest operator. This solves a number of
misparsing issues when a global &quot;_&quot; subroutine is
defined.</p>

<p>&quot;mkdir()&quot; &quot;mkdir()&quot; without
arguments now defaults to $_.</p>

<p>Magic goto and eval The construct &quot;eval { goto
&amp;foo }&quot; is now disallowed. (Note that the similar
construct, but with &quot;eval(&quot;&quot;)&quot; instead,
was already forbidden.)</p>

<p>$# has been removed The deprecated $# variable (output
format for numbers) has been removed. A new warning,
&quot;$# is no longer supported&quot;, has been added.</p>

<p>&quot;:unique&quot; The &quot;:unique&quot; attribute
has been made a no-op, since its current implementation was
fundamentally flawed and not threadsafe.</p>

<p>Scoping of the &quot;sort&quot; pragma The
&quot;sort&quot; pragma is now lexically scoped. Its effect
used to be global.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements The &quot;feature&quot; pragma The
&quot;feature&quot; pragma is used to enable new syntax that
would break Perls backwards-compatibility with older
releases of the language. Its a lexical pragma, like
&quot;strict&quot; or &quot;warnings&quot;.</p>

<p>Currently the following new features are available:
&quot;switch&quot; (adds a switch statement), &quot;~~&quot;
(adds a Perl 6-like smart match operator), &quot;say&quot;
(adds a &quot;say&quot; built-in function), and
&quot;err&quot; (adds an &quot;err&quot; keyword). Those
features are described below.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;err&quot; low-precedence defined-or
operator used to be enabled by default (although as a weak
keyword, meaning that any function would override it). Its
now only recognized when explicitly turned on (and is then a
regular keyword).</p>

<p>Those features, and the &quot;feature&quot; pragma
itself, have been contributed by Robin Houston.</p>

<p>Switch and Smart Match operator Perl 5 now has a switch
statement. Its available when &quot;use feature
&rsquo;switch&rsquo;&quot; is in effect. This feature
introduces three new keywords, &quot;given&quot;,
&quot;when&quot;, and &quot;default&quot;:</p>

<p>given ($foo) { when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; } when (/^def/)
{ $def = 1; } when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; } default { $nothing
= 1; } }</p>

<p>A more complete description of how Perl matches the
switch variable against the &quot;when&quot; conditions is
given in &quot;Switch statements&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p>This kind of match is called smart match, and it s also
possible to use it outside of switch statements, via the new
&quot;~~&quot; operator (enabled via the &quot;use feature
&rsquo;~~&rsquo;&quot; directive). See &quot;Smart matching
in detail&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p>&quot;say()&quot; say() is a new built-in, only
available when &quot;use feature &rsquo;say&rsquo;&quot; is
in effect, that is similar to print(), but that implicitly
appends a newline to the printed string. See &quot;say&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p>&quot;CLONE_SKIP()&quot; Perl has now support for the
&quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; special subroutine. Like
&quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is called once per
package; however, it is called just before cloning starts,
and in the context of the parent thread. If it returns a
true value, then no objects of that class will be cloned.
See perlmod for details. (Contributed by Dave Mitchell.)</p>

<p>&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot; A new internal
variable, &quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;, gives the
native status returned by the last pipe close, backtick
command, successful call to wait() or waitpid(), or from the
system() operator. See perlrun for details. (Contributed by
Gisle Aas.)</p>

<p>Assertions The support for assertions, introduced in
perl 5.9.0, has been improved. The syntax for the
&quot;-A&quot; command-line switch has changed; it now
accepts an optional module name, defaulting to
&quot;assertions::activate&quot;. See assertions and
perlrun. (Contributed by Salvador Fandin~o Garcia.)</p>

<p>Unicode Character Database 4.1.0 The copy of the Unicode
Character Database included in Perl 5.9 has been updated to
4.1.0.</p>

<p>&quot;no VERSION&quot; You can now use &quot;no&quot;
followed by a version number to specify that you want to use
a version of perl older than the specified one.</p>

<p>Recursive sort subs You can now use recursive
subroutines with sort(), thanks to Robin Houston.</p>

<p>Effect of pragmas in eval The compile-time value of the
&quot;%^H&quot; hint variable can now propagate into
eval(&quot;&quot;)uated code. This makes it more useful to
implement lexical pragmas.</p>

<p>As a side-effect of this, the overloaded-ness of
constants now propagates into eval(&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>New -E command-line switch -E is equivalent to -e, but
it implicitly enables all optional features (like &quot;use
feature &quot;:5.10&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>&quot;chdir&quot;, &quot;chmod&quot; and
&quot;chown&quot; on filehandles &quot;chdir&quot;,
&quot;chmod&quot; and &quot;chown&quot; can now work on
filehandles as well as filenames, if the system supports
respectively &quot;fchdir&quot;, &quot;fchmod&quot; and
&quot;fchown&quot;, thanks to a patch provided by Gisle
Aas.</p>

<p>OS groups $( and $) now return groups in the order where
the OS returns them, thanks to Gisle Aas. This wasnt
previously the case.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata New Core Modules &middot; A new
pragma, &quot;feature&quot;, has been added; see above in
&quot;Core Enhancements&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;assertions::compat&quot;, also available
on CPAN, allows the use of assertions on perl versions prior
to 5.9.0 (that is the first one to natively support
them).</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Math::BigInt::FastCalc&quot; is an
XS-enabled, and thus faster, version of
&quot;Math::BigInt::Calc&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Compress::Zlib&quot; is an interface to
the zlib compression library. It comes with a bundled
version of zlib, so having a working zlib is not a
prerequisite to install it. It s used by
&quot;Archive::Tar&quot; (see below).</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;IO::Zlib&quot; is an
&quot;IO::&quot;-style interface to
&quot;Compress::Zlib&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Archive::Tar&quot; is a module to
manipulate &quot;tar&quot; archives.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Digest::SHA&quot; is a module used to
calculate many types of SHA digests, has been included for
SHA support in the CPAN module.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;ExtUtils::CBuilder&quot; and
&quot;ExtUtils::ParseXS&quot; have been added.</p>

<p>Utility Changes &quot;ptar&quot; &quot;ptar&quot; is a
pure perl implementation of &quot;tar&quot;, that comes with
&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;ptardiff&quot; &quot;ptardiff&quot; is a small
script used to generate a diff between the contents of a tar
archive and a directory tree. Like &quot;ptar&quot;, it
comes with &quot;Archive::Tar&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;shasum&quot; This command-line utility, used to
print or to check SHA digests, comes with the new
&quot;Digest::SHA&quot; module.</p>

<p>&quot;h2xs&quot; enhancements &quot;h2xs&quot;
implements a new option &quot;--use-xsloader&quot; to force
use of &quot;XSLoader&quot; even in backwards compatible
modules.</p>

<p>The handling of authors names that had apostrophes has
been fixed.</p>

<p>Any enums with negative values are now skipped.</p>

<p>&quot;perlivp&quot; enhancements &quot;perlivp&quot; no
longer checks for *.ph files by default. Use the new
&quot;-a&quot; option to run all tests.</p>

<p>Documentation Perl Glossary The perlglossary manpage is
a glossary of terms used in the Perl documentation,
technical and otherwise, kindly provided by OReilly Media,
Inc.</p>

<p>perltodo now lists a rough roadmap to Perl 5.10.</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements XS-assisted SWASHGET Some
pure-perl code that perl was using to retrieve Unicode
properties and transliteration mappings has been
reimplemented in XS.</p>

<p>Constant subroutines The interpreter internals now
support a far more memory efficient form of inlineable
constants. Storing a reference to a constant value in a
symbol table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a
constant subroutine, but using about 400 bytes less memory.
This proxy constant subroutine is automatically upgraded to
a real typeglob with subroutine if necessary. The approach
taken is analogous to the existing space optimisation for
subroutine stub declarations, which are stored as plain
scalars in place of the full typeglob.</p>

<p>Several of the core modules have been converted to use
this feature for their system dependent constants - as a
result &quot;use POSIX;&quot; now takes about 200K less
memory.</p>

<p>&quot;PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV&quot; The new compilation
flag &quot;PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV&quot;, introduced as an
option in perl 5.8.8, is turned on by default in perl 5.9.3.
It prevents perl from creating an empty scalar with every
new typeglob. See perl589delta for details.</p>

<p>Weak references are cheaper Weak reference creation is
now O(1) rather than O(n), courtesy of Nicholas Clark. Weak
reference deletion remains O(n), but if deletion only
happens at program exit, it may be skipped completely.</p>

<p>sort() enhancements Salvador Fandin~o provided
improvements to reduce the memory usage of &quot;sort&quot;
and to speed up some cases.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements Compilation
improvements Parallel makes should work properly now,
although there may still be problems if &quot;make
test&quot; is instructed to run in parallel.</p>

<p>Building with Borlands compilers on Win32 should work
more smoothly. In particular Steve Hay has worked to side
step many warnings emitted by their compilers and at least
one C compiler internal error.</p>

<p>Perl extensions on Windows now can be statically built
into the Perl DLL, thanks to a work by Vadim Konovalov.</p>

<p>New Or Improved Platforms Perl is being ported to
Symbian OS. See perlsymbian for more information.</p>

<p>The VMS port has been improved. See perlvms.</p>

<p>DynaLoader::dl_unload_file() now works on Windows.</p>

<p>Portability of Perl on various recent compilers on
Windows has been improved (Borland C++, Visual C++ 7.0).</p>

<p>New probes &quot;Configure&quot; will now detect
&quot;clearenv&quot; and &quot;unsetenv&quot;, thanks to a
patch from Alan Burlison. It will also probe for
&quot;futimes&quot; (and use it internally if available),
and whether &quot;sprintf&quot; correctly returns the length
of the formatted string.</p>

<p>Module auxiliary files README files and changelogs for
CPAN modules bundled with perl are no longer installed.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes &quot;defined $$x&quot; &quot;use
strict &quot;refs&quot;&quot; was ignoring taking a hard
reference in an argument to defined(), as in :</p>

<p>use strict &quot;refs&quot;; my $x = &quot;foo&quot;; if
(defined $$x) {...}</p>

<p>This now correctly produces the run-time error
&quot;Can&rsquo;t use string as a SCALAR ref while
&quot;strict refs&quot; in use&quot;. (However,
&quot;defined @$foo&quot; and &quot;defined %$foo&quot; are
still allowed. Those constructs are discouraged anyway.)</p>

<p>Calling CORE::require() CORE::require() and CORE::do()
were always parsed as require() and do() when they were
overridden. This is now fixed.</p>

<p>Subscripts of slices You can now use a non-arrowed form
for chained subscripts after a list slice, like in:</p>

<p>({foo =&gt; &quot;bar&quot;})[0]{foo}</p>

<p>This used to be a syntax error; a &quot;-&gt;&quot; was
required.</p>

<p>Remove over-optimisation Perl 5.9.2 introduced a change
so that assignments of &quot;undef&quot; to a scalar, or of
an empty list to an array or a hash, were optimised out. As
this could cause problems when &quot;goto&quot; jumps were
involved, this change was backed out.</p>

<p>sprintf() fixes Using the sprintf() function with some
formats could lead to a buffer overflow in some specific
cases. This has been fixed, along with several other bugs,
notably in bounds checking.</p>

<p>In related fixes, it was possible for badly written code
that did not follow the documentation of
&quot;Sys::Syslog&quot; to have formatting vulnerabilities.
&quot;Sys::Syslog&quot; has been changed to protect people
from poor quality third party code.</p>

<p>no warningscategoryworks correctly with -w Previously
when running with warnings enabled globally via
&quot;-w&quot;, selective disabling of specific warning
categories would actually turn off all warnings. This is now
fixed; now &quot;no warnings &rsquo;io&rsquo;;&quot; will
only turn off warnings in the &quot;io&quot; class.
Previously it would erroneously turn off all warnings.</p>

<p>Smaller fixes &middot; &quot;FindBin&quot; now works
better with directories where access rights are more
restrictive than usual.</p>

<p>&middot; Several memory leaks in ithreads were closed.
Also, ithreads were made less memory-intensive.</p>

<p>&middot; Trailing spaces are now trimmed from $! and
$^E.</p>

<p>&middot; Operations that require perl to read a process
list of groups, such as reads of $( and $), now dynamically
allocate memory rather than using a fixed sized array. The
fixed size array could cause C stack exhaustion on systems
configured to use large numbers of groups.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; now works better
with non-default $/ settings.</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;x&quot; repetition operator is now
able to operate on &quot;qw//&quot; lists. This used to
raise a syntax error.</p>

<p>&middot; The debugger now traces correctly execution in
eval(&quot;&quot;)uated code that contains #line
directives.</p>

<p>&middot; The value of the &quot;open&quot; pragma is no
longer ignored for three- argument opens.</p>

<p>&middot; Perl will now use the C library calls
&quot;unsetenv&quot; and &quot;clearenv&quot; if present to
delete keys from %ENV and delete %ENV entirely, thanks to a
patch from Alan Burlison.</p>

<p>More Unicode Fixes &middot; chr() on a negative value
now gives &quot;FFD}&quot;, the Unicode replacement
character, unless when the &quot;bytes&quot; pragma is in
effect, where the low eight bytes of the value are used.</p>

<p>&middot; Some case insensitive matches between UTF-8
encoded data and 8 bit regexps, and vice versa, could give
malformed character warnings. These have been fixed by Dave
Mitchell and Yves Orton.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;lcfirst&quot; and &quot;ucfirst&quot;
could corrupt the string for certain cases where the length
UTF-8 encoding of the string in lower case, upper case or
title case differed. This was fixed by Nicholas Clark.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics Attempt to set length of
freed array This is a new warning, produced in situations
like the following one:</p>

<p>$r = do {my @a; a}; $$r = 503;</p>

<p>Non-string passed as bitmask This is a new warning,
produced when number has been passed as a argument to
select(), instead of a bitmask.</p>

<p># Wrong, will now warn $rin = fileno(STDIN);
($nfound,$timeleft) = select($rout=$rin, undef, undef,
$timeout);</p>

<p># Should be $rin = &rsquo;&rsquo;;
vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1; ($nfound,$timeleft) =
select($rout=$rin, undef, undef, $timeout);</p>

<p>Search pattern not terminated or ternary operator parsed
as search pattern This syntax error indicates that the lexer
couldn t find the final delimiter of a &quot;?PATTERN?&quot;
construct. Mentioning the ternary operator in this error
message makes syntax diagnostic easier.</p>

<p>&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration
This warning is now emitted in more consistent cases; in
short, when one of the declarations involved is a
&quot;my&quot; variable:</p>

<p>my $x; my $x; # warns my $x; our $x; # warns our $x; my
$x; # warns</p>

<p>On the other hand, the following:</p>

<p>our $x; our $x;</p>

<p>now gives a &quot;&quot;our&quot; variable %s
redeclared&quot; warning.</p>

<p>readdir()/closedir()/etc. attempted on invalid dirhandle
These new warnings are now emitted when a dirhandle is used
but is either closed or not really a dirhandle.</p>

<p>Changed Internals In general, the source code of perl
has been refactored, tied up, and optimized in many places.
Also, memory management and allocation has been improved in
a couple of points.</p>

<p>Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine
which function parameters and local variables could actually
be declared &quot;const&quot; to the C compiler. Steve
Peters provided new *_set macros and reworked the core to
use these rather than assigning to macros in LVALUE
context.</p>

<p>Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under
&quot;-DT&quot;.</p>

<p>A new file, mathoms.c, has been added. It contains
functions that are no longer used in the perl core, but that
remain available for binary or source compatibility reasons.
However, those functions will not be compiled in if you add
&quot;-DNO_MATHOMS&quot; in the compiler flags.</p>

<p>The &quot;AvFLAGS&quot; macro has been removed.</p>

<p>The &quot;av_*()&quot; functions, used to manipulate
arrays, no longer accept null &quot;AV*&quot;
parameters.</p>

<p>B:: modules inheritance changed The inheritance
hierarchy of &quot;B::&quot; modules has changed;
&quot;B::NV&quot; now inherits from &quot;B::SV&quot; (it
used to inherit from &quot;B::IV&quot;).</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org/ . There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team.</p>
