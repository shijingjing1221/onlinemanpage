<p>NAME pamtopam - copy PAM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtopam</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtopam simply copies a PAM image from Standard Input
to Standard Out- put. This may seem an unnecessary
duplication of cat, but remember that a PAM program can read
a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as if it were PAM. So pamtopam can
read either a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM image and produce a PAM
image as output.</p>

<p>Even that is of limited usefulness because of the fact
that almost any program to which you would feed the
resulting PAM image could also just take the original image
directly. However, sometimes you really want a true PAM
image.</p>

<p>You can do a more general job of translating PAM/PNM to
PAM with pam- channel.</p>

<p>HISTORY This program was added to Netpbm in Release
10.41 (December 2007).</p>
