<p>PWMCONFIG(8) PWMCONFIG(8)</p>

<p>NAME pwmconfig - tests the PWM outputs of sensors and
configures fancontrol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pwmconfig</p>

<p>WARNING pwmconfig will attempt to stop your fans, one at
a time, for approxi- mately 5 seconds each. This may cause
your processor temperature to rise. Verify that all fans are
running at normal speed after this pro- gram has exited.
pwmconfig does its best to check that the fans are spinning
when they are supposed to, but due to the diversity of
avail- able motherboards and fans, it shouldn t be blindly
trusted. Always verify by yourself.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended to run pwmconfig at a time
when there is no significant system load, to minimize the
risk of overheating.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pwmconfig searches your sensors for pulse
width modulation (PWM) con- trols, and tests each one to see
if it controls a fan on your mother- board. Note that many
motherboards do not have PWM circuitry installed, even if
your sensor chip supports PWM.</p>

<p>When a connection is established between a PWM control
and a fan, pwm- config can generate a detailed correlation,
to show how a given fan is responding to various PWM duty
cycles.</p>

<p>Lastly, pwmconfig will enter in fancontrol configuration
mode (unless you decide to skip that part.) In this mode,
you are invited to enter several parameters which will
determine how the fancontrol daemon regu- lates the speed of
one or more fans in your system based on temperature
measurements. In particular, you will have the opportunity
to establish mappings between fans and temperature inputs,
define the temperature range over which the speed of the fan
should be adjusted dynamically, the minimum speed at which
the fan should spin, etc. See fancontrol(8) for additional
information.</p>

<p>BUGS The term &quot;PWM&quot; is used because most fan
control systems in computers are based on pulse width
modulation. Some motherboards however use DC variation
instead. So, the term &quot;PWM&quot; should be seen as a
generic term for &quot;fan speed control&quot;, regardless
of the actual method used.</p>
