<p>PINFO(1) PINFO(1)</p>

<p>NAME pinfo - curses based lynx-style info browser</p>

<p>SYNTAX pinfo [options] [infopage]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is a program for viewing info files.
You specify which page you want to read by passing it an
infopage argument. This argument contains the name of an
info page (i.e. bash ). The program will then (by default)
search for it in the current directory, /usr/share/info,
/usr/info, /usr/local/share/info, /usr/local/info. and
/opt/info. The search path can be adjusted by INFOPATH
environment variable or in the configuration file. Pinfo
will also automatically add the suffix -info , -info.Z,
-info.gz, or -info.bz2. At present other suf- fixes are not
recognized, but you can easily add them to the function
openinfo() in filehandling_functions.c.</p>

<p>When the search for info pages fails, man is called with
the infopage argument, and its output is parsed by pinfo.
This means that when you don t have the appropriate info
page, but have a man page instead; the man page will be
viewed.</p>

<p>When no infopage is specified, the default dir page is
shown.</p>

<p>Supported options are</p>

<p>-h, --help - print help information and exit.</p>

<p>-v, --version - print version information and exit.</p>

<p>-m, --manual - uses manual page instead of info by
default. (pinfo -m could be used as a manual pager).
Warning: Everything what follows this option is passed to
the man program. Dont be confused if pinfo options, which
followed -m don t work. When using this option, pinfo does
not parse the info options as usual! It invokes the man part
of program.</p>

<p>You can also call the man function of pinfo in another
way. When pinfo is called with an argv[0] (the program file
name), which contains the word man in it s name, the man
functions are enabled automatically.</p>

<p>Previously there was a symlink to pinfo, called pman,
but I had to remove it from the distribution, since its name
was in conflict with some other utility. Anyway, you can
feel free to create such a link if you wish.</p>

<p>-r, --raw-filename - uses a raw filename first (i.e. the
name which you specified as infopage is considered to be a
real file in the specified location).</p>

<p>-f, --file synonym for -r.</p>

<p>-a, --apropos - if this is set, apropos is called when
no man or info page could be found.</p>

<p>-c, --cut-man-headers - if this is set, man parsing code
will try to cut out the repeated man headers. Use with care.
;)</p>

<p>-s, --squeeze-lines- cut empty lines from manual pages.
This option enables auto cutting of every repeated newline
in a manual page.</p>

<p>-t, --force-manual-tag-table- forces manual detection of
tag table. This allows you to view info pages, which may be
corrupted. (as i.e. version of jeds pages, shipped with
RH5.0). The tag table corruption usually appears in that the
info links, which you follow, move you to quite unexpected
nodes.</p>

<p>--node=nodename, --node nodename- Go to the node
nodename of info file. Since 0.6.7 it is also possible to
specify nodes as in standalone info via file names, like
(gcc)Introduction.</p>

<p>--rcfile=filename, --rcfile filename- Use alternate
configuration file.</p>

<p>--long-manual-links, -l- Use long link names in manuals.
On some sys- tems the manual hierarchy is divided into
subsections like 3ncurses, etc, while on other systems all
belongs to section 3. If this option is what your system is
like, feel free to use it.</p>

<p>--clear-at-exit, -x- Clear screen at exit.</p>

<p>The options are handled by GNU getopt, so you can here
(as in other programs) abbreviate the option names to the
minimal number of charac- ters by which the options
differ.</p>

<p>Warning! If you do not have getopt, these options will
not work!</p>

<p>DEFAULT KEYS WHEN BROWSING INFO FILE Just take a look at
the example configuration file (below), and at the key
descriptions. Keys available in manual viewer differ a bit
from the keys available in info viewer.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT There is a variable $INFOPATH, which can
specify the paths to be searched for info files. Its format
is similar to that of the $PATH variable. An example setting
could look like:</p>

<p>/usr/info:/usr/somewhere/info:/not/even/in/usr/info</p>

<p>etc. Directories are separated by colons.</p>

<p>COLOR AND KEY DEFINITIONS There are configuration files
called ~/.pinforc and [prefix]/etc/pin- forc, for local and
global configuration (where prefix is the prefix of the
directory, where pinfo is installed, i.e. /usr/local, or /).
Heres an example of such a file; well discuss the contents
below:</p>

<p># Here are some color setting. # Whitespace between the
entries is optional. COL_NORMAL = COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK,
NO_BOLD, NO_BLINK COL_MENUSELECTED = COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLACK,

<p>As you can see, the format is simple. First Ill explain
the color def- initions. First you must enter a color name
(all available color names are present in the example, and
they re self explanatory, I think. There is also a special
color COLOR_DEFAULT, which stands for trans- parency). Then
you enter the foreground color, and the background color.
The BOLD attribute means that we want the foreground color
to be highlighted. (i.e. light blue, light green). BLINK
attribute is the blinking attribute, or highlighted
background in some other configura- tions.</p>

<p>Now let s move to the key definitions. Here we first put
a key name (again all keys are present in the example); then
we enter its value -- either surrounded by apostrophes, or a
keycode number (like in KEY_REFRESH_1), or its mnemonic code
name if its a special key (like i.e. in
KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1).</p>

<p>If you wish to specify key by code value, use the
supplied program testkey to obtain the needed value. It
mainly is a feature, when you want to add some CTRL+letter
keybindings, and similar.</p>

<p>For each function you can bind two keys, i.e. you could
bind both Enter and Cursor Right to the FollowLink-function.
As you can see in the example above, the two key names are
KEY_FOLLOWLINK_1 and KEY_FOL- LOWLINK_2.</p>

<p>Heres an explanation of the key names:</p>

<p>KEY_LEFT</p>

<p>KEY_RIGHT</p>

<p>KEY_DOWN</p>

<p>KEY_HOME</p>

<p>KEY_BACKSPACE</p>

<p>KEY_NPAGE</p>

<p>KEY_PPAGE</p>

<p>KEY_END [Note: this works probably ONLY with Linux
ncurses]</p>

<p>KEY_F(x)</p>

<p>KEY_CTRL) - this assigns the key value to a ctrl+c
combination. c may be any letter you wish.</p>

<p>KEY_ALT) - this assigns the key value to a alt+c
combination. c may be any letter you wish. If alt key wont
work, you may use ESC+key combination.</p>

<p>c - this means a printable character c. The syntax is
just like in C/C++ ;).</p>

<p>[number] - you can also specify key as its code number.
It is useful e.g. when specifying control keys, and some
nonstandard keys. A numerical value of zero turns given key
binding off.</p>

<p>See manual page for curs_getch (3x) for description of
their meaning.</p>

<p>Warning! Try not to create some serious key binding
conflicts!</p>

<p>The options in the last part of the example
configuration file should be fairly self-explanatory. The
variables that can be set to true or false do the same
things as the command line arguments with the same
names.</p>

<p>MANUAL If this is set to true the default is to first
check for a man page, instead of a texinfo file.</p>

<p>CUT-MAN-HEADERS If set to true, then pinfo tries to cut
off the repeated headers throughout man pages.</p>

<p>CUT-EMPTY-MAN-LINES If set to true, then pinfo tries to
cut off the repeated newlines (i.e. it will shorten each set
of consecutive newlines to one newline).</p>

<p>RAW-FILENAME If set to true, the file argument is taken
to be the name of a file in the current working directory,
i.e. the directories in INFOPATH will only be searched if a
file with this name is not in the working directory.</p>

<p>APROPOS If set to true, apropos is called if no info or
man page is found.</p>

<p>DONT-HANDLE-WITHOUT-TAG-TABLE If set to true , pinfo
will not attempt to display texinfo pages without tag
tables.</p>

<p>HTTPVIEWER Set this to the program you want to use to
follow http links in documents.</p>

<p>FTPVIEWER Set this to the program you want to use to
follow ftp links in documents.</p>

<p>MAILEDITOR Set this to your favorite email program, and
it will be started if you follow an email link in a
document.</p>

<p>PRINTUTILITY Utility, which you use for printing. I.e.
lpr. If you don t use any, you may also try something like
cat &gt;/dev/lp1, or sth. ;)</p>

<p>MANLINKS This specifies the section names, which may be
refer- enced in your man pages (i.e. Xtoolkit man pages
match the section 3Xt (see for example XtVaCreateWidget)
manpage), Xlib function pages match section 3X11, etc. Such
extensions may not be recognized by default, so it is a good
idea to add them).</p>

<p>INFOPATH This allows you to override the default search
path for info pages. The paths should be separated by
colons.</p>

<p>MAN-OPTIONS This specifies the options, which should be
passed to the man program. (see man(1) for description of
what theyre like).</p>

<p>STDERR-REDIRECTION Pinfo allows you to redirect the
stderr output of called programs. For example if you don t
want to see man s error messages about manual page
formatting, you can use STDER-REDIRECTION=&quot;2&gt;
/dev/null&quot;. This is the default.</p>

<p>LONG-MANUAL-LINKS This is another true/false option,
which decides whether your system supports long manual
section names, or not. (i.e. &quot;3ncurses&quot; instead of
&quot;3&quot;).</p>

<p>FILTER-0xB7 This decides, whether you want to convert
0xb7 chars to o, or not. For example for iso-8859-2 fonts
this makes mans list marks a bit nicer ;) (look for exam-
ple at perls man page, to see how those marks look
like).</p>

<p>QUIT-CONFIRMATION This decides whether you want to use
quit confirmation on exit, or not.</p>

<p>QUIT-CONFIRM-DEFAULT This yes/no option determines the
default answer to the QUIT-CONFIRMATION dialog. (default
answer is when you press a key, that does not match the
asked ques- tion).</p>

<p>CLEAR-SCREEN-AT-EXIT This true/false option determines
if you want to have your screen cleared at exit, or no.</p>

<p>CALL-READLINE-HISTORY This true/false option determines
if you want to have a prompt of last history entry whenever
calling read- line wrapper, eg. in subsequent searches.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHTREGEXP This is an option, through which you may
pass to pinfo regexps, which should be highlighted when
working with document. Warning! This may turn very slow if
you use it without care!</p>

<p>SAFE-USER This option is used to pass the name of user,
to which suid when pinfo is run with root privileges.</p>

<p>SAFE-GROUP This option is used to pass the name of
group, to which suid when pinfo is run with root
privileges.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONALIZATION SUPPORT Pinfo implements general
features of gnu gettext library (the thing, which you need
to see national messages ;). But it is not the end. Pinfo
allows you to use national info pages! You only need to put
them to your info directory, into a subdirectory, which is
called $LANG.</p>
