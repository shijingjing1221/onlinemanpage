<p>DUMPE2FS(8) DUMPE2FS(8)</p>

<p>NAME dumpe2fs - dump ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dumpe2fs [ -bfhixV ] [ -o superblock=superblock
] [ -o blocksize=block- size ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dumpe2fs prints the super block and blocks
group information for the filesystem present on device.</p>

<p>dumpe2fs is similar to Berkeleys dumpfs program for the
BSD Fast File System.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b print the blocks which are reserved as bad in
the filesystem.</p>

<p>-o superblock=superblock use the block superblock when
examining the filesystem. This option is not usually needed
except by a filesystem wizard who is examining the remains
of a very badly corrupted filesystem.</p>

<p>-o blocksize=blocksize use blocks of blocksize bytes
when examining the filesystem. This option is not usually
needed except by a filesystem wizard who is examining the
remains of a very badly corrupted filesys- tem.</p>

<p>-f force dumpe2fs to display a filesystem even though it
may have some filesystem feature flags which dumpe2fs may
not understand (and which can cause some of dumpe2fss
display to be suspect).</p>

<p>-h only display the superblock information and not any
of the block group descriptor detail information.</p>

<p>-i display the filesystem data from an image file
created by e2image, using device as the pathname to the
image file.</p>

<p>-x print the detailed group information block numbers in
hexadeci- mal format</p>

<p>-V print the version number of dumpe2fs and exit.</p>

<p>BUGS You need to know the physical filesystem structure
to understand the output.</p>
