<p>KRB5.CONF(5) KRB5.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME krb5.conf - Kerberos configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION krb5.conf contains configuration information
needed by the Kerberos V5 library. This includes information
describing the default Kerberos realm, and the location of
the Kerberos key distribution centers for known realms.</p>

<p>The krb5.conf file uses an INI-style format. Sections
are delimited by square braces; within each section, there
are relations where tags can be assigned to have specific
values. Tags can also contain a subsec- tion, which contains
further relations or subsections. A tag can be assigned to
multiple values. Here is an example of the INI-style for-
mat used by krb5.conf:</p>

<p>[section1] tag1 = value_a tag1 = value_b tag2 =
value_c</p>

<p>[section 2] tag3 = { subtag1 = subtag_value_a subtag1 =
subtag_value_b subtag2 = subtag_value_c } tag4 = { subtag1 =
subtag_value_d subtag2 = subtag_value_e }</p>

<p>krb5.conf can include other files using the directives
&quot;include FILE- NAME&quot; or &quot;includedir
DIRNAME&quot;, which must occur at the beginning of a line.
FILENAME or DIRNAME should be an absolute path. The named
file or directory must exist and be readable. Including a
directory includes all files within the directory whose
names consist solely of alphanumeric characters, dashes, or
underscores. Included profile files are syntactically
independent of their parents, so each included file must
begin with a section header.</p>

<p>krb5.conf can cause configuration to be obtained from a
loadable pro- file module by placing the directive
&quot;module MODULEPATH:RESIDUAL&quot; at the beginning of a
line before any section headers. MODULEPATH may be relative
to the library path of the krb5 installation, or it may be
an absolute path. RESIDUAL is provided to the module at
initialization time. If krb5.conf uses a module directive,
kdc.conf should also use one if it exists.</p>

<p>The following sections are currently used in the
krb5.conf file:</p>

<p>[libdefaults] Contains various default values used by
the Kerberos V5 library.</p>

<p>[login] Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5
login program, login.krb5(8).</p>

<p>[appdefaults] Contains default values that can be used
by Kerberos V5 applica- tions.</p>

<p>[realms] Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm
names which describe where to find the Kerberos servers for
a particular realm, and other realm-specific
information.</p>

<p>[domain_realm] Contains relations which map subdomains
and domain names to Ker- beros realm names. This is used by
programs to determine what realm a host should be in, given
its fully qualified domain name.</p>

<p>[logging] Contains relations which determine how
Kerberos entities are to perform their logging.</p>

<p>[capaths] Contains the authentication paths used with
non-hierarchical cross-realm. Entries in the section are
used by the client to determine the intermediate realms
which may be used in cross- realm authentication. It is also
used by the end-service when checking the transited field
for trusted intermediate realms.</p>

<p>[dbdefaults] Contains default values for database
specific parameters.</p>

<p>[dbmodules] Contains database specific parameters used
by the database library.</p>

<p>[plugins] Contains plugin module registration and
filtering parameters.</p>

<p>Each of these sections will be covered in more details
in the following sections.</p>

<p>LIBDEFAULTS SECTION The following relations are defined
in the [libdefaults] section:</p>

<p>default_keytab_name This relation specifies the default
keytab name to be used by application severs such as telnetd
and rlogind. The default is &quot;/etc/krb5.keytab&quot;.
This formerly defaulted to &quot;/etc/v5srvtab&quot;, but
was changed to the current value.</p>

<p>default_realm This relation identifies the default realm
to be used in a client hosts Kerberos activity.</p>

<p>default_tgs_enctypes This relation identifies the
supported list of session key encryption types that should
be returned by the KDC. The list may be delimited with
commas or whitespace.</p>

<p>default_tkt_enctypes This relation identifies the
supported list of session key encryption types that should
be requested by the client, in the same format.</p>

<p>permitted_enctypes This relation identifies the
permitted list of session key encryption types.</p>

<p>allow_weak_crypto If this is set to 0 (for false), then
weak encryption types will be filtered out of the previous
three lists. The default value for this tag is false, which
may cause authentication failures in existing Kerberos
infrastructures that do not support strong crypto. Users in
affected environments should set this tag to true until
their infrastructure adopts stronger ciphers.</p>

<p>clockskew This relation sets the maximum allowable
amount of clockskew in seconds that the library will
tolerate before assuming that a Kerberos message is invalid.
The default value is 300 seconds, or five minutes.</p>

<p>ignore_acceptor_hostname When accepting GSSAPI or krb5
security contexts for host-based service principals, ignore
any hostname passed by the calling application and allow any
service principal present in the keytab which matches the
service name and realm name (if given). This option can
improve the administrative flexibility of server
applications on multi-homed hosts, but can compromise the
secu- rity of virtual hosting environments. The default
value is false.</p>

<p>k5login_authoritative If the value of this relation is
true (the default), principals must be listed in a local
users k5login file to be granted login access, if a k5login
file exists. If the value of this relation is false, a
principal may still be granted login access through other
mechanisms even if a k5login file exists but does not list
the principal.</p>

<p>k5login_directory If set, the library will look for a
local users k5login file within the named directory, with a
filename corresponding to the local username. If not set,
the library will look for k5login files in the user s home
directory, with the filename .k5login. For security reasons,
k5login files must be owned by the local user or by
root.</p>

<p>kdc_timesync If the value of this relation is non-zero
(the default), the library will compute the difference
between the system clock and the time returned by the KDC
and in order to correct for an inaccurate system clock. This
corrective factor is only used by the Kerberos library.</p>

<p>kdc_req_checksum_type For compatibility with DCE
security servers which do not support the default
CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD5 used by this version of Kerberos. Use a
value of 2 to use the CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD4 instead. This
applies to DCE 1.1 and earlier. This value is only used for
DES keys; other keys use the preferred checksum type for
those keys.</p>

<p>ap_req_checksum_type If set this variable controls what
ap-req checksum will be used in authenticators. This
variable should be unset so the appropriate checksum for the
encryption key in use will be used. This can be set if
backward compatibility requires a specific checksum
type.</p>

<p>safe_checksum_type This allows you to set the preferred
keyed-checksum type for use in KRB_SAFE messages. The
default value for this type is CKSUM- TYPE_RSA_MD5_DES. For
compatibility with applications linked against DCE version
1.1 or earlier Kerberos libraries, use a value of 3 to use
the CKSUMTYPE_RSA_MD4_DES instead. This field is ignored
when its value is incompatible with the session key
type.</p>

<p>preferred_preauth_types This allows you to set the
preferred preauthentication types which the client will
attempt before others which may be adver- tised by a KDC.
The default value for this setting is &quot;17, 16, 15,
14&quot;, which forces libkrb5 to attempt to use PKINIT if
it is supported.</p>

<p>ccache_type User this parameter on systems which are DCE
clients, to specify the type of cache to be created by
kinit, or when forwarded tickets are received. DCE and
Kerberos can share the cache, but some versions of DCE do
not support the default cache as created by this version of
Kerberos. Use a value of 1 on DCE 1.0.3a sys- tems, and a
value of 2 on DCE 1.1 systems.</p>

<p>dns_lookup_kdc Indicate whether DNS SRV records should
be used to locate the KDCs and other servers for a realm, if
they are not listed in the information for the realm. The
default is to use these records.</p>

<p>dns_lookup_realm Indicate whether DNS TXT records should
be used to determine the Kerberos realm of a host. The
default is not to use these records.</p>

<p>dns_fallback General flag controlling the use of DNS for
Kerberos informa- tion. If both of the preceding options are
specified, this option has no effect.</p>

<p>realm_try_domains Indicate whether a hosts domain
components should be used to determine the Kerberos realm of
the host. The value of this variable is an integer: -1 means
not to search, 0 means to try the hosts domain itself, 1
means to also try the domains immediate parent, and so
forth. The librarys usual mechanism for locating Kerberos
realms is used to determine whether a domain is a valid
realm--which may involve consulting DNS if dns_lookup_kdc is
set. The default is not to search domain com- ponents.</p>

<p>extra_addresses This allows a computer to use multiple
local addresses, in order to allow Kerberos to work in a
network that uses NATs. The addresses should be in a
comma-separated list.</p>

<p>udp_preference_limit When sending a message to the KDC,
the library will try using TCP before UDP if the size of the
message is above &quot;udp_prefer- ence_limit&quot;. If the
message is smaller than &quot;udp_prefer- ence_limit&quot;,
then UDP will be tried before TCP. Regardless of the size,
both protocols will be tried if the first attempt fails.</p>

<p>verify_ap_req_nofail If this flag is set, then an
attempt to get initial credentials will fail if the client
machine does not have a keytab. The default for the flag is
false.</p>

<p>ticket_lifetime The value of this tag is the default
lifetime for initial tick- ets. The default value for the
tag is 1 day (1d).</p>

<p>renew_lifetime The value of this tag is the default
renewable lifetime for ini- tial tickets. The default value
for the tag is 0.</p>

<p>noaddresses Setting this flag causes the initial
Kerberos ticket to be addressless. The default for the flag
is true.</p>

<p>forwardable If this flag is set, initial tickets by
default will be forward- able. The default value for this
flag is false.</p>

<p>proxiable If this flag is set, initial tickets by
default will be proxi- able. The default value for this flag
is false.</p>

<p>rdns If set to false, prevent the use of reverse DNS
resolution when translating hostnames into service principal
names. Defaults to true. Setting this flag to false is more
secure, but may force users to exclusively use fully
qualified domain names when authenticating to services.</p>

<p>plugin_base_dir If set, determines the base directory
where krb5 plugins are located. The default value is the
&quot;krb5/plugins&quot; subdirectory of the krb5 library
directory.</p>

<p>APPDEFAULTS SECTION Each tag in the [appdefaults]
section names a Kerberos V5 application or an option that is
used by some Kerberos V5 application[s]. The four ways that
you can set values for options are as follows, in decreasing
order of precedence:</p>

<p>#1) application = { realm1 = { option = value } realm2 =
{ option = value } } #2) application = { option1 = value
option2 = value } #3) realm = { option = value } #4) option
= value</p>

<p>LOGIN SECTION The [login] section is used to configure
the behavior of the Kerberos V5 login program,
login.krb5(8). Refer to the manual entry for login.krb5 for
a description of the relations allowed in this section.</p>

<p>REALMS SECTION Each tag in the [realms] section of the
file names a Kerberos realm. The value of the tag is a
subsection where the relations in that sub- section define
the properties of that particular realm. For example:</p>

<p>[realms] ATHENA.MIT.EDU = { admin_server =
KERBEROS.MIT.EDU default_domain = MIT.EDU database_module =
ldapconf v4_instance_convert = { mit = mit.edu lithium =
lithium.lcs.mit.edu } v4_realm = LCS.MIT.EDU }</p>

<p>For each realm, the following tags may be specified in
the realms sub- section:</p>

<p>kdc The value of this relation is the name of a host
running a KDC for that realm. An optional port number
(preceded by a colon) may be appended to the hostname. This
tag should generally be used only if the realm administrator
has not made the informa- tion available through DNS.</p>

<p>admin_server This relation identifies the host where the
administration server is running. Typically this is the
Master Kerberos server.</p>

<p>database_module This relation indicates the name of the
configuration section under dbmodules for database specific
parameters used by the loadable database library.</p>

<p>default_domain This relation identifies the default
domain for which hosts in this realm are assumed to be in.
This is needed for translating V4 principal names (which do
not contain a domain name) to V5 principal names (which
do).</p>

<p>v4_instance_convert This subsection allows the
administrator to configure exceptions to the default_domain
mapping rule. It contains V4 instances (the tag name) which
should be translated to some specific host- name (the tag
value) as the second component in a Kerberos V5 principal
name.</p>

<p>v4_realm This relation is used by the krb524 library
routines when con- verting a V5 principal name to a V4
principal name. It is used when V4 realm name and the V5
realm are not the same, but still share the same principal
names and passwords. The tag value is the Kerberos V4 realm
name.</p>

<p>auth_to_local_names This subsection allows you to set
explicit mappings from princi- pal names to local user
names. The tag is the mapping name, and the value is the
corresponding local user name.</p>

<p>auth_to_local This tag allows you to set a general rule
for mapping principal names to local user names. It will be
used if there is not an explicit mapping for the principal
name that is being trans- lated. The possible values
are:</p>

<p>DB:&lt;filename&gt; The principal will be looked up in
the database &lt;file- name&gt;. Support for this is not
currently compiled in by default. RULE:&lt;exp&gt; The local
name will be formulated from &lt;exp&gt;. DEFAULT The
principal name will be used as the local name. If the
principal has more than one component or is not in the
default realm, this rule is not applicable and the
conversion will fail.</p>

<p>DOMAIN_REALM SECTION The [domain_realm] section provides
a translation from a hostname to the Kerberos realm name for
the services provided by that host.</p>

<p>The tag name can be a hostname, or a domain name, where
domain names are indicated by a prefix of a period (.)
character. The value of the relation is the Kerberos realm
name for that particular host or domain. Host names and
domain names should be in lower case.</p>

<p>If no translation entry applies, the host s realm is
considered to be the hostnames domain portion converted to
upper case. For example, the following [domain_realm]
section:</p>

<p>[domain_realm] .mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU mit.edu =
ATHENA.MIT.EDU dodo.mit.edu = SMS_TEST.MIT.EDU .ucsc.edu =
CATS.UCSC.EDU</p>

<p>maps dodo.mit.edu into the SMS_TEST.MIT.EDU realm, all
other hosts in the MIT.EDU domain to the ATHENA.MIT.EDU
realm, and all hosts in the UCSC.EDU domain into the
CATS.UCSC.EDU realm. ucbvax.berkeley.edu would be mapped by
the default rules to the BERKELEY.EDU realm, while
sage.lcs.mit.edu would be mapped to the LCS.MIT.EDU
realm.</p>

<p>LOGGING SECTION The [logging] section indicates how a
particular entity is to perform its logging. The relations
specified in this section assign one or more values to the
entity name.</p>

<p>Currently, the following entities are used:</p>

<p>kdc These entries specify how the KDC is to perform its
logging.</p>

<p>admin_server These entries specify how the
administrative server is to per- form its logging.</p>

<p>default These entries specify how to perform logging in
the absence of explicit specifications otherwise.</p>

<p>Values are of the following forms:</p>

<p>FILE=&lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p>FILE:&lt;filename&gt; This value causes the entitys
logging messages to go to the specified file. If the = form
is used, then the file is over- written. Otherwise, the file
is appended to.</p>

<p>STDERR This value causes the entitys logging messages to
go to its standard error stream.</p>

<p>CONSOLE This value causes the entitys logging messages
to go to the console, if the system supports it.</p>

<p>DEVICE=&lt;devicename&gt; This causes the entitys
logging messages to go to the specified device.</p>

<p>SYSLOG[:&lt;severity&gt;[:&lt;facility&gt;]] This causes
the entitys logging messages to go to the system log.</p>

<p>The severity argument specifies the default severity of
system log messages. This may be any of the following
severities sup- ported by the syslog(3) call minus the LOG_
prefix: LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR,
LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO, and LOG_DEBUG. For
example, to specify LOG_CRIT severity, one would use CRIT
for severity.</p>

<p>The facility argument specifies the facility under which
the messages are logged. This may be any of the following
facili- ties supported by the syslog(3) call minus the LOG_
prefix: LOG_KERN, LOG_USER, LOG_MAIL, LOG_DAEMON, LOG_AUTH,
LOG_LPR, LOG_NEWS, LOG_UUCP, LOG_CRON, and LOG_LOCAL0
through LOG_LOCAL7.</p>

<p>If no severity is specified, the default is ERR, and if
no facility is specified, the default is AUTH.</p>

<p>In the following example, the logging messages from the
KDC will go to the console and to the system log under the
facility LOG_DAEMON with default severity of LOG_INFO; and
the logging messages from the admin- istrative server will
be appended to the file /var/adm/kadmin.log and sent to the
device /dev/tty04.</p>

<p>[logging] kdc = CONSOLE kdc = SYSLOG:INFO:DAEMON
admin_server = FILE:/var/adm/kadmin.log admin_server =
DEVICE=/dev/tty04</p>

<p>CAPATHS SECTION Cross-realm authentication is typically
organized hierarchically. This hierarchy is based on the
name of the realm, which thus imposes restrictions on the
choice of realm names, and on who may participate in a
cross-realm authentication. A non hierarchical organization
may be used, but requires a database to construct the
authentication paths between the realms. This section
defines that database.</p>

<p>A client will use this section to find the
authentication path between its realm and the realm of the
server. The server will use this section to verify the
authentication path used be the client, by checking the
transited field of the received ticket.</p>

<p>There is a tag name for each participating realm, and
each tag has sub- tags for each of the realms. The value of
the subtags is an intermedi- ate realm which may participate
in the cross-realm authentication. The subtags may be
repeated if there is more then one intermediate realm. A
value of &quot;.&quot; means that the two realms share keys
directly, and no intermediate realms should be allowed to
participate.</p>

<p>There are n**2 possible entries in this table, but only
those entries which will be needed on the client or the
server need to be present. The client needs a tag for its
local realm, with subtags for all the realms of servers it
will need to authenticate with. A server needs a tag for
each realm of the clients it will serve.</p>

<p>For example, ANL.GOV, PNL.GOV, and NERSC.GOV all wish to
use the ES.NET realm as an intermediate realm. ANL has a sub
realm of TEST.ANL.GOV which will authenticate with NERSC.GOV
but not PNL.GOV. The [capath] section for ANL.GOV systems
would look like this:</p>

<p>[capaths] ANL.GOV = { TEST.ANL.GOV = . PNL.GOV = ES.NET
NERSC.GOV = ES.NET ES.NET = . } TEST.ANL.GOV = { ANL.GOV = .
} PNL.GOV = { ANL.GOV = ES.NET } NERSC.GOV = { ANL.GOV =
ES.NET } ES.NET = { ANL.GOV = . }</p>

<p>The [capath] section of the configuration file used on
NERSC.GOV sys- tems would look like this:</p>

<p>[capaths] NERSC.GOV = { ANL.GOV = ES.NET TEST.ANL.GOV =
ES.NET TEST.ANL.GOV = ANL.GOV PNL.GOV = ES.NET ES.NET = . }
ANL.GOV = { NERSC.GOV = ES.NET } PNL.GOV = { NERSC.GOV =
ES.NET } ES.NET = { NERSC.GOV = . } TEST.ANL.GOV = {
NERSC.GOV = ANL.GOV NERSC.GOV = ES.NET }</p>

<p>In the above examples, the ordering is not important,
except when the same subtag name is used more then once. The
client will use this to determine the path. (It is not
important to the server, since the tran- sited field is not
sorted.)</p>

<p>If this section is not present, or if the client or
server cannot find a client/server path, then normal
hierarchical organization is assumed.</p>

<p>This feature is not currently supported by DCE. DCE
security servers can be used with Kerberized clients and
servers, but versions prior to DCE 1.1 did not fill in the
transited field, and should be used with caution.</p>

<p>DATABASE DEFAULT SECTION The [dbdefaults] section
indicates default values for the database spe- cific
parameters. It can also specify the configuration section
under dbmodules for database specific parameters used by the
loadable database library.</p>

<p>The following tags are used in this section:</p>

<p>database_module This relation indicates the name of the
configuration section under dbmodules for database specific
parameters used by the loadable database library.</p>

<p>ldap_kerberos_container_dn This LDAP specific tag
indicates the DN of the container object where the realm
objects will be located. This value is used if no object DN
is mentioned in the configuration section under
dbmodules.</p>

<p>ldap_kdc_dn This LDAP specific tag indicates the default
bind DN for the KDC server. The KDC server does a login to
the directory as this object. This value is used if no
object DN is mentioned in the configuration section under
dbmodules.</p>

<p>ldap_kadmind_dn This LDAP specific tag indicates the
default bind DN for the Administration server. The
Administration server does a login to the directory as this
object. This value is used if no object DN is mentioned in
the configuration section under dbmodules.</p>

<p>ldap_service_password_file This LDAP specific tag
indicates the file containing the stashed passwords for the
objects used for starting the Kerberos servers. This value
is used if no service password file is men- tioned in the
configuration section under dbmodules.</p>

<p>ldap_servers This LDAP specific tag indicates the list
of LDAP servers. The list of LDAP servers is
whitespace-separated. The LDAP server is specified by a LDAP
URI. This value is used if no LDAP servers are mentioned in
the configuration section under dbmodules.</p>

<p>ldap_conns_per_server This LDAP specific tag indicates
the number of connections to be maintained per LDAP server.
This value is used if the number of connections per LDAP
server are not mentioned in the configura- tion section
under dbmodules. The default value is 5.</p>

<p>DATABASE MODULE SECTION Each tag in the [dbmodules]
section of the file names a configuration section for
database specific parameters that can be referred to by a
realm. The value of the tag is a subsection where the
relations in that subsection define the database specific
parameters.</p>

<p>For each section, the following tags may be specified in
the subsec- tion:</p>

<p>database_name This DB2-specific tag indicates the
location of the database in the filesystem.</p>

<p>db_library This tag indicates the name of the loadable
database library. The value should be db2 for db2 database
and kldap for LDAP database.</p>

<p>disable_last_success If set to true, suppresses KDC
updates to the &quot;Last successful authentication&quot;
field of principal entries requiring preauthen- tication.
Setting this flag may improve performance. (Princi- pal
entries which do not require preauthentication never update
the &quot;Last successful authentication&quot; field.)</p>

<p>disable_lockout If set to true, suppresses KDC updates
to the &quot;Last failed authentication&quot; and
&quot;Failed password attempts&quot; fields of princi- pal
entries requiring preauthentication. Setting this flag may
improve performance, but also disables account lockout.</p>

<p>ldap_kerberos_container_dn This LDAP specific tag
indicates the DN of the container object where the realm
objects will be located.</p>

<p>ldap_kdc_dn This LDAP specific tag indicates the bind DN
for the KDC server. The KDC does a login to the directory as
this object.</p>

<p>ldap_kadmind_dn This LDAP specific tag indicates the
bind DN for the Administra- tion server. The Administration
server does a login to the directory as this object.</p>

<p>ldap_service_password_file This LDAP specific tag
indicates the file containing the stashed passwords for the
objects used for starting the Kerberos servers.</p>

<p>ldap_servers This LDAP specific tag indicates the list
of LDAP servers. The list of LDAP servers is
whitespace-separated. The LDAP server is specified by a LDAP
URI.</p>

<p>ldap_conns_per_server This LDAP specific tag indicates
the number of connections to be maintained per LDAP
server.</p>

<p>PLUGINS SECTION Tags in the [plugins] section can be
used to register dynamic plugin modules and to turn modules
on and off. Not every krb5 pluggable interface uses the
[plugins] section; the ones that do are documented here.</p>

<p>Each pluggable interface corresponds to a subsection of
[plugins]. All subsections support the same tags:</p>

<p>module This tag may have multiple values. Each value is
a string of the form &quot;modulename:pathname&quot;, which
causes the shared object located at pathname to be
registered as a dynamic module named modulename for the
pluggable interface. If pathname is not an absolute path, it
will be treated as relative to the plugin base
directory.</p>

<p>enable_only This tag may have multiple values. If there
are values for this tag, then only the named modules will be
enabled for the plug- gable interface.</p>

<p>disable This tag may have multiple values. If there are
values for this tag, then the named modules will be disabled
for the pluggable interface.</p>

<p>The following subsections are currently supported within
the [plugins] section:</p>

<p>pwqual interface The pwqual subsection controls modules
for the password quality inter- face, which is used to
reject weak passwords when passwords are changed. In
addition to any registered dynamic modules, the following
built-in modules exist (and may be disabled with the disable
tag):</p>

<p>dict Checks against the realm dictionary file</p>

<p>empty Rejects empty passwords</p>

<p>hesiod Checks against user information stored in Hesiod
(only if Ker- beros was built with Hesiod support)</p>

<p>princ Checks against components of the principal
name</p>

<p>kadm5_hook interface The kadm5_hook interface provides
plugins with information on principal creation,
modification, password changes and deletion. This interface
can be used to write a plugin to synchronize MIT Kerberos
with another database such as Active Directory. No plugins
are built in for this interface.</p>

<p>clpreauth and kdcpreauth interfaces The clpreauth and
kdcpreauth interfaces allow plugin modules to provide client
and KDC preauthentication mechanisms. The following built-in
modules exist for these interfaces:</p>

<p>pkinit This module implements the PKINIT
preauthentication mechanism.</p>

<p>encrypted_challenge This module implements the encrypted
challenge FAST factor.</p>

<p>encrypted_timestamp This module implements the encrypted
timestamp mechanism.</p>
