<p>POSIX_MEM_OFFSET(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_MEM_OFFSET(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_mem_offset - find offset and length of a
mapped typed memory block (ADVANCED REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_mem_offset(const void *restrict addr, size_t
len, off_t *restrict off, size_t *restrict contig_len, int
*restrict fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_mem_offset() function shall return
in the variable pointed to by off a value that identifies
the offset (or location), within a mem- ory object, of the
memory block currently mapped at addr. The function shall
return in the variable pointed to by fildes, the descriptor
used (via mmap()) to establish the mapping which contains
addr. If that descriptor was closed since the mapping was
established, the returned value of fildes shall be -1. The
len argument specifies the length of the block of the memory
object the user wishes the offset for; upon return, the
value pointed to by contig_len shall equal either len, or
the length of the largest contiguous block of the memory
object that is currently mapped to the calling process
starting at addr, whichever is smaller.</p>

<p>If the memory object mapped at addr is a typed memory
object, then if the off and contig_len values obtained by
calling posix_mem_offset() are used in a call to mmap() with
a file descriptor that refers to the same memory pool as
fildes (either through the same port or through a different
port), and that was opened with neither the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE nor the
POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the typed memory area
that is mapped shall be exactly the same area that was
mapped at addr in the address space of the process that
called posix_mem_offset().</p>

<p>If the memory object specified by fildes is not a typed
memory object, then the behavior of this function is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
posix_mem_offset() function shall return zero; otherwise,
the corresponding error status value shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_mem_offset() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EACCES The process has not mapped a memory object
supported by this function at the given address addr.</p>

<p>This function shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>
