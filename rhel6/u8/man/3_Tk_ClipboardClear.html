Tk_ClipboardClear(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_ClipboardClear, Tk_ClipboardAppend - Manage the
clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_ClipboardClear(interp, tkwin)</p>

<p>int Tk_ClipboardAppend(interp, tkwin, target, format,
buffer)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
reporting errors.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Window that determines which dis-
plays clipboard to manipulate.</p>

<p>Atom target (in) Conversion type for this clip- board
item; has same meaning as target argument to Tk_CreateSel-
Handler.</p>

<p>Atom format (in) Representation to use when data is
retrieved; has same meaning as format argument to Tk_Create-
SelHandler.</p>

<p>char *buffer (in) Null terminated string containing the
data to be appended to the clipboard.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These two procedures manage the clipboard
for Tk. The clipboard is typically managed by calling
Tk_ClipboardClear once, then calling Tk_ClipboardAppend to
add data for any number of targets.</p>

<p>Tk_ClipboardClear claims the CLIPBOARD selection and
frees any data items previously stored on the clipboard in
this application. It nor- mally returns TCL_OK, but if an
error occurs it returns TCL_ERROR and leaves an error
message in interp-&gt;result. Tk_ClipboardClear must be
called before a sequence of Tk_ClipboardAppend calls can be
issued.</p>

<p>Tk_ClipboardAppend appends a buffer of data to the
clipboard. The first buffer for a given target determines
the format for that target. Any successive appends for that
target must have the same format or an error will be
returned. Tk_ClipboardAppend returns TCL_OK if the buffer is
successfully copied onto the clipboard. If the clipboard is
not currently owned by the application, either because
Tk_Clipboard- Clear has not been called or because ownership
of the clipboard has changed since the last call to
Tk_ClipboardClear, Tk_ClipboardAppend returns TCL_ERROR and
leaves an error message in interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>In order to guarantee atomicity, no event handling
should occur between Tk_ClipboardClear and the following
Tk_ClipboardAppend calls (otherwise someone could retrieve a
partially completed clipboard or claim owner- ship away from
this application).</p>

<p>Tk_ClipboardClear may invoke callbacks, including
arbitrary Tcl scripts, as a result of losing the CLIPBOARD
selection, so any calling function should take care to be
reentrant at the point Tk_Clipboard- Clear is invoked.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS append, clipboard, clear, format, type</p>
