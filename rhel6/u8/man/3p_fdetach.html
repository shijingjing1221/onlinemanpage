<p>FDETACH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FDETACH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fdetach - detach a name from a STREAMS-based file
descriptor (STREAMS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fdetach(const char *path);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fdetach() function shall detach a
STREAMS-based file from the file to which it was attached by
a previous call to fattach(). The path argument points to
the pathname of the attached STREAMS file. The pro- cess
shall have appropriate privileges or be the owner of the
file. A successful call to fdetach() shall cause all
pathnames that named the attached STREAMS file to again name
the file to which the STREAMS file was attached. All
subsequent operations on path shall operate on the
underlying file and not on the STREAMS file.</p>

<p>All open file descriptions established while the STREAMS
file was attached to the file referenced by path shall still
refer to the STREAMS file after the fdetach() has taken
effect.</p>

<p>If there are no open file descriptors or other
references to the STREAMS file, then a successful call to
fdetach() shall be equivalent to performing the last close()
on the attached file.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fdetach() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fdetach() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix.</p>

<p>EINVAL The path argument names a file that is not
currently attached.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The size of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}
or a pathname compo- nent is longer than {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The effective user ID is not the owner of path and
the process does not have appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>The fdetach() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Detaching a File The following example detaches
the STREAMS-based file /tmp/named-STREAM from the file to
which it was attached by a previous, successful call to
fattach(). Subsequent calls to open this file refer to the
underly- ing file, not to the STREAMS file.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stropts.h&gt; ... char *filename =
&quot;/tmp/named-STREAM&quot;; int ret;</p>

<p>ret = fdetach(filename);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
