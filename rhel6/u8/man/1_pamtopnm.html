<p>NAME pamtopnm - convert PAM image to PBM, PGM, or
PPM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtopnm</p>

<p>[-assume]</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtopnm reads a PAM image as input and produces an
equivalent PBM, PGM, or PPM (i.e. PNM) image, whichever is
most appropriate, as output.</p>

<p>pamtopnm assumes the PAM image represents the
information required for a PBM, PGM, or PPM image if its
tuple type is BLACKANDWHITE, GRAYSCALE , or RGB and its
depth and maxval are appropriate. If this is not the case,
pamtopnm fails.</p>

<p>However, you can override the tuple type requirement
with the -assume option.</p>

<p>As with any Netpbm program that reads PAM images,
pamtopnm also reads PNM images as if they were PAM. In that
case, pamtopnms functions reduces to simply copying the
input to the output. But this can be useful in a program
that doesnt know whether its input is PAM or PNM but needs
to feed it to a program that only recognizes PNM.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -assume When you specify -assume, you tell
pamtopnm that you personally vouch for the fact that the
tuples contain the same data as belongs in the channels of a
PBM, PGM, or PPM file. The depth must still conform, though,
so to truly force a conversion, you may have to run the
input through pamchannel first. But be careful with -assume.
When you -assume, you make an -ass of u and me.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtopnm was new, along with the PAM format, in
Netpbm 9.7 (August 2000).</p>
