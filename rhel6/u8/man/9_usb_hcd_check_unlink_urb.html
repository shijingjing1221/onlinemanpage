<p>USB_HCD_CHECK_UNLINK(9) Host Controller APIs
USB_HCD_CHECK_UNLINK(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_hcd_check_unlink_urb - check whether an URB may
be unlinked</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_hcd_check_unlink_urb(struct usb_hcd *
hcd, struct urb * urb, int status);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS hcd host controller to which urb was
submitted</p>

<p>urb URB being checked for unlinkability</p>

<p>status error code to store in urb if the unlink
succeeds</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Host controller drivers should call this
routine in their dequeue method. The HCD&acute;s private
spinlock must be held and interrupts must be disabled. The
actions carried out here are required for making sure than
an unlink is valid.</p>

<p>Returns 0 for no error, otherwise a negative error code
(in which case the dequeue method must fail). The possible
error codes are:</p>

<p>-EIDRM: urb was not submitted or has already completed.
The completion function may not have been called yet.</p>

<p>-EBUSY: urb has already been unlinked.</p>
