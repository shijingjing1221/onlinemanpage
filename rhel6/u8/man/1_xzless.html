<p>XZLESS(1) XZ Utils XZLESS(1)</p>

<p>NAME xzless, lzless - view xz or lzma compressed (text)
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xzless [file...] lzless [file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xzless is a filter that displays pagefulls
of uncompressed text from compressed file(s) to a terminal.
It works on files compressed with xz(1) or lzma(1). If no
files are given, xzless reads from standard input.</p>

<p>xzless uses less(1) as its only pager. Unlike xzmore,
the choice of pagers is not alterable by an environment
variable. Commands are based on both more(1) and vi(1), and
allow back and forth movement and searching. See the less(1)
manual for more information.</p>

<p>The command named lzless is provided for backward
compatibility with LZMA Utils.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT LESSMETACHARS A list of characters special
to the shell. Set by xzless unless it is already set in the
environment.</p>

<p>LESSOPEN Set to a command line to invoke the xz(1)
decompressor for pre- processing the input files to
less(1).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO less(1), xz(1), xzmore(1), zless(1)</p>
