<p>WCSTOMBS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual WCSTOMBS(3)</p>

<p>NAME wcstombs - convert a wide-character string to a
multibyte string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcstombs(char *dest, const wchar_t *src, size_t
n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If dest is not a NULL pointer, the
wcstombs() function converts the wide-character string src
to a multibyte string starting at dest. At most n bytes are
written to dest. The conversion starts in the initial state.
The conversion can stop for three reasons:</p>

<p>1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be
represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the
current locale). In this case (size_t) -1 is returned.</p>

<p>2. The length limit forces a stop. In this case the
number of bytes written to dest is returned, but the shift
state at this point is lost.</p>

<p>3. The wide-character string has been completely
converted, including the terminating L&rsquo; &rsquo;. In
this case the conversion ends in the initial state. The
number of bytes written to dest, excluding the terminating
&rsquo; &rsquo; byte, is returned.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least n bytes at dest.</p>

<p>If dest is NULL, n is ignored, and the conversion
proceeds as above, except that the converted bytes are not
written out to memory, and that no length limit exists.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer
should make sure n is greater or equal to
wcstombs(NULL,src,0)+1.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcstombs() function returns the number
of bytes that make up the converted part of multibyte
sequence, not including the terminating null byte. If a wide
character was encountered which could not be con- verted,
(size_t) -1 is returned.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of wcstombs() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>The function wcsrtombs(3) provides a thread safe
interface to the same functionality.</p>
