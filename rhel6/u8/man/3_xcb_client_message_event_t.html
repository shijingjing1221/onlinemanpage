<p>NAME xcb_client_message_event_t - NOT YET DOCUMENTED</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Event datastructure typedef struct
xcb_client_message_event_t { uint8_t response_type; uint8_t
format; uint16_t sequence; xcb_window_t window; xcb_atom_t
type; xcb_client_message_data_t data; }
xcb_client_message_event_t;</p>

<p>EVENT FIELDS response_type The type of this event, in
this case XCB_CLIENT_MESSAGE. This field is also present in
the xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart
from each other.</p>

<p>sequence The sequence number of the last request
processed by the X11 server.</p>

<p>format Specifies how to interpret data. Can be either 8,
16 or 32.</p>

<p>window NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>type An atom which indicates how the data should be
interpreted by the receiving client.</p>

<p>data The data itself (20 bytes max).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This event represents a ClientMessage, sent
by another X11 client. An example is a client sending the
_NET_WM_STATE ClientMessage to the root window to indicate
the fullscreen window state, effectively requesting that the
window manager puts it into fullscreen mode.</p>
