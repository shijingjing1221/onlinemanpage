<p>NAME emacs - GNU project Emacs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS emacs [ command-line switches ] [ files ...
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU Emacs is a version of Emacs, written by
the author of the original (PDP-10) Emacs, Richard Stallman.
The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs
Manual, which you can read using Info, either from Emacs or
as a standalone program. Please look there for complete and
up-to-date documentation. This man page is updated only when
someone volunteers to do so; the Emacs maintainers priority
goal is to minimize the amount of time this man page takes
away from other more useful projects. The user functionality
of GNU Emacs encompasses everything other Emacs editors do,
and it is easily extensible since its editing commands are
written in Lisp.</p>

<p>Emacs has an extensive interactive help facility, but
the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate Emacs
windows and buffers. CTRL-h or F1 enters the Help facility.
Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) starts an interactive tutorial
which can teach beginners the fundamentals of Emacs in a few
minutes. Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you find a com- mand
given its functionality, Help Character (CTRL-h c) describes
a given characters effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f)
describes a given Lisp function specified by name.</p>

<p>Emacss Undo can undo several steps of modification to
your buffers, so it is easy to recover from editing
mistakes.</p>

<p>GNU Emacss many special packages handle mail reading
(RMail) and send- ing (Mail), outline editing (Outline),
compiling (Compile), running subshells within Emacs windows
(Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop
(Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy (Doctor),
and much more.</p>

<p>There is an extensive reference manual, but users of
other Emacses should have little trouble adapting even
without a copy. Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic
features fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and using
the self-documentation features.</p>

<p>Emacs Options The following options are of general
interest:</p>

<p>file Edit file.</p>

<p>--file file, --find-file file, --visit file The same as
specifying file directly as an argument.</p>

<p>+number Go to the line specified by number (do not
insert a space between the &quot;+&quot; sign and the
number). This applies only to the next file specified.</p>

<p>+line:column Go to the specified line and column.</p>

<p>-q, --no-init-file Do not load an init file.</p>

<p>--no-site-file Do not load the site-wide startup
file.</p>

<p>--no-desktop Do not load a saved desktop.</p>

<p>-nl, --no-shared-memory Do not use shared memory.</p>

<p>-Q, --quick Equivalent to &quot;-q --no-site-file
--no-splash&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-splash Do not display a splash screen during
start-up.</p>

<p>--debug-init Enable Emacs Lisp debugger during the
processing of the user init file ~/.emacs. This is useful
for debugging problems in the init file.</p>

<p>-u user, --user user Load users init file.</p>

<p>-t file, --terminal file Use specified file as the
terminal instead of using stdin/stdout. This must be the
first argument specified in the command line.</p>

<p>--multibyte, --no-unibyte Enable multibyte mode (enabled
by default).</p>

<p>--unibyte, --no-multibyte Enable unibyte mode.</p>

<p>--version Display Emacs version information and
exit.</p>

<p>--help Display this help and exit.</p>

<p>The following options are lisp-oriented (these options
are processed in the order encountered):</p>

<p>-f function, --funcall function Execute the lisp
function function.</p>

<p>-l file, --load file Load the lisp code in the file
file.</p>

<p>--eval expr, --execute expr Evaluate the Lisp expression
expr.</p>

<p>The following options are useful when running Emacs as a
batch editor:</p>

<p>--batch Edit in batch mode. The editor will send
messages to stderr. This option must be the first in the
argument list. You must use -l and -f options to specify
files to execute and functions to call.</p>

<p>--script file Run file as an Emacs Lisp script.</p>

<p>--insert file Insert contents of file into the current
buffer.</p>

<p>--kill Exit Emacs while in batch mode.</p>

<p>-L dir, --directory dir Add dir to the list of
directories Emacs searches for Lisp files.</p>

<p>Using Emacs with X Emacs has been tailored to work well
with the X window system. If you run Emacs from under X
windows, it will create its own X window to dis- play in.
You will probably want to start the editor as a background
process so that you can continue using your original
window.</p>

<p>Emacs can be started with the following X switches:</p>

<p>--name name Specify the name which should be assigned to
the initial Emacs window. This controls looking up X
resources as well as the window title.</p>

<p>-T name, --title name Specify the title for the initial
X window.</p>

<p>-r, -rv, --reverse-video Display the Emacs window in
reverse video.</p>

<p>-fn font, --font font Set the Emacs window s font to
that specified by font. You will find the various X fonts in
the /usr/lib/X11/fonts directory. Note that Emacs will only
accept fixed width fonts. Under the X11 Release 4 font-
naming conventions, any font with the value &quot;m&quot; or
&quot;c&quot; in the eleventh field of the font name is a
fixed width font. Furthermore, fonts whose name are of the
form widthxheight are generally fixed width, as is the font
fixed. See xlsfonts(1) for more information.</p>

<p>When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between
the switch and the font name.</p>

<p>--xrm resources Set additional X resources.</p>

<p>--color, --color=mode Override color mode for character
terminals; mode defaults to auto, and can also be never,
auto, always, or a mode name like ansi8.</p>

<p>-bw pixels, --border-width pixels Set the Emacs windows
border width to the number of pixels specified by pixels.
Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.</p>

<p>-ib pixels, --internal-border pixels Set the windows
internal border width to the number of pixels specified by
pixels. Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side of the
window.</p>

<p>-g geometry, --geometry geometry Set the Emacs windows
width, height, and position as specified. The geometry
specification is in the stan- dard X format; see X(7) for
more information. The width and height are specified in
characters; the default is 80 by 24. See the Emacs manual,
section &quot;Options for Window Size and Position&quot;,
for information on how window sizes interact with selecting
or deselecting the tool bar and menu bar.</p>

<p>-lsp pixels, --line-spacing pixels Additional space to
put between lines.</p>

<p>-vb, --vertical-scroll-bars Enable vertical
scrollbars.</p>

<p>-fh, --fullheight Make the first frame as high as the
screen.</p>

<p>-fs, --fullscreen Make the first frame fullscreen.</p>

<p>-fw, --fullwidth Make the first frame as wide as the
screen.</p>

<p>-fg color, --foreground-color color On color displays,
set the color of the text.</p>

<p>Use the command M-x list-colors-display for a list of
valid color names.</p>

<p>-bg color, --background-color color On color displays,
set the color of the windows back- ground.</p>

<p>-bd color, --border-color color On color displays, set
the color of the windows border.</p>

<p>-cr color, --cursor-color color On color displays, set
the color of the windows text cursor.</p>

<p>-ms color, --mouse-color color On color displays, set
the color of the windows mouse cursor.</p>

<p>-d displayname, --display displayname Create the Emacs
window on the display specified by dis- playname. Must be
the first option specified in the command line.</p>

<p>-nbi, --no-bitmap-icon Do not use picture of gnu for
Emacs icon.</p>

<p>--iconic Start Emacs in iconified state.</p>

<p>-nbc, --no-blinking-cursor Disable blinking cursor.</p>

<p>-nw, --no-window-system Tell Emacs not to use its
special interface to X. If you use this switch when invoking
Emacs from an xterm(1) window, display is done in that
window.</p>

<p>-D, --basic-display This option disables many display
features; use it for debugging Emacs.</p>

<p>You can set X default values for your Emacs windows in
your .Xresources file (see xrdb(1)). Use the following
format:</p>

<p>emacs.keyword:value</p>

<p>where value specifies the default value of keyword.
Emacs lets you set default values for the following
keywords:</p>

<p>background (class Background) For color displays, sets
the window s background color.</p>

<p>bitmapIcon (class BitmapIcon) If bitmapIcons value is
set to on, the window will iconify into the &quot;kitchen
sink.&quot;</p>

<p>borderColor (class BorderColor) For color displays, sets
the color of the windows bor- der.</p>

<p>borderWidth (class BorderWidth) Sets the windows border
width in pixels.</p>

<p>cursorColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the color of the windows text cursor.</p>

<p>cursorBlink (class CursorBlink) Specifies whether to
make the cursor blink. The default is on. Use off or false
to turn cursor blinking off.</p>

<p>font (class Font) Sets the windows text font.</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the windows text color.</p>

<p>fullscreen (class Fullscreen) The desired fullscreen
size. The value can be one of fullboth, fullwidth, or
fullheight, which correspond to the command-line options -fs
, -fw , and -fh, respectively. Note that this applies to the
initial frame only.</p>

<p>geometry (class Geometry) Sets the geometry of the Emacs
window (as described above).</p>

<p>iconName (class Title) Sets the icon name for the Emacs
window icon.</p>

<p>internalBorder (class BorderWidth) Sets the windows
internal border width in pixels.</p>

<p>lineSpacing (class LineSpacing) Additional space
(&quot;leading&quot;) between lines, in pixels.</p>

<p>menuBar (class MenuBar) Gives frames menu bars if on;
don t have menu bars if off. See the Emacs manual, sections
&quot;Lucid Resources&quot; and &quot;LessTif
Resources&quot;, for how to control the appear- ance of the
menu bar if you have one.</p>

<p>minibuffer (class Minibuffer) If none, don t make a
minibuffer in this frame. It will use a separate minibuffer
frame instead.</p>

<p>paneFont (class Font) Font name for menu pane titles, in
non-toolkit versions of Emacs.</p>

<p>pointerColor (class Foreground) For color displays, sets
the color of the windows mouse cursor.</p>

<p>privateColormap (class PrivateColormap) If on, use a
private color map, in the case where the &quot;default
visual&quot; of class PseudoColor and Emacs is using it.</p>

<p>reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo) If reverseVideos value
is set to on, the window will be displayed in reverse
video.</p>

<p>screenGamma (class ScreenGamma) Gamma correction for
colors, equivalent to the frame parameter screen-gamma.</p>

<p>scrollBarWidth (class ScrollBarWidth) The scroll bar
width in pixels, equivalent to the frame parameter
scroll-bar-width.</p>

<p>selectionFont (class SelectionFont) Font name for pop-up
menu items, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs. (For toolkit
versions, see the Emacs manual, sections &quot;Lucid
Resources&quot; and &quot;LessTif Resources&quot;.)</p>

<p>selectionTimeout (class SelectionTimeout) Number of
milliseconds to wait for a selection reply. A value of 0
means wait as long as necessary.</p>

<p>synchronous (class Synchronous) Run Emacs in synchronous
mode if on. Synchronous mode is useful for debugging X
problems.</p>

<p>title (class Title) Sets the title of the Emacs
window.</p>

<p>toolBar (class ToolBar) Number of lines to reserve for
the tool bar.</p>

<p>useXIM (class UseXIM) Turns off use of X input methods
(XIM) if false or off.</p>

<p>verticalScrollBars (class ScrollBars) Gives frames
scroll bars if on; suppresses scroll bars if off.</p>

<p>visualClass (class VisualClass) Specify the
&quot;visual&quot; that X should use. This tells X how to
handle colors. The value should start with one of TrueColor,
PseudoColor, DirectColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, and
StaticGray, followed by -depth, where depth is the number of
color planes.</p>

<p>If you try to set color values while using a black and
white display, the windows characteristics will default as
follows: the foreground color will be set to black, the
background color will be set to white, the border color will
be set to grey, and the text and mouse cursors will be set
to black.</p>

<p>Using the Mouse The following lists some of the mouse
button bindings for the Emacs window under X11.</p>

<p>MOUSE BUTTON FUNCTION
------------------------------------------------------------
left Set point. middle Paste text. right Cut text into X cut
buffer. SHIFT-middle Cut text into X cut buffer. SHIFT-right
Paste text. CTRL-middle Cut text into X cut buffer and kill
it. CTRL-right Select this window, then split it into two
windows. Same as typing CTRL-x 2. CTRL-SHIFT-left X buffer
menu hold the buttons and keys down, wait for menu to
appear, select buffer, and release. Move mouse out of menu
and release to cancel.</p>

<p>CTRL-SHIFT-middle X help menu pop up index card menu for
Emacs help. CTRL-SHIFT-right Select window with mouse, and
delete all other windows. Same as typing CTRL-x 1.</p>

<p>MANUALS You can order printed copies of the GNU Emacs
Manual from the Free Software Foundation, which develops GNU
software. See the file ORDERS for ordering information. Your
local Emacs maintainer might also have copies available. As
with all software and publications from FSF, everyone is
permitted to make and distribute copies of the Emacs manual.
The TeX source to the man- ual is also included in the Emacs
source distribution.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/share/info files for the Info
documentation browser. The complete text of the Emacs
reference manual is included in a convenient tree structured
form. Also includes the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, useful
to anyone wishing to write programs in the Emacs Lisp
extension language.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp Lisp source files
and compiled files that define most editing commands. Some
are preloaded; others are autoloaded from this directory
when used.</p>

<p>/usr/local/libexec/emacs/$VERSION/$ARCH various programs
that are used with GNU Emacs.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc various files of
information.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* contains the
documentation strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded
Lisp functions of GNU Emacs. They are stored here to reduce
the size of Emacs proper.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE lists people
offering vari- ous services to assist users of GNU Emacs,
including education, trou- bleshooting, porting and
customization.</p>

<p>BUGS There is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org, for
reporting Emacs bugs and fixes. But before reporting
something as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is
a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate feature. We
ask you to read the section Reporting Emacs Bugs near the
end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints on
how and when to report bugs. Also, include the version
number of the Emacs you are running in every bug report that
you send in. Bugs tend actually to be fixed if they can be
isolated, so it is in your interest to report them in such a
way that they can be easily reproduced.</p>

<p>Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report. The
purpose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone
in the next release, if possible. For personal assistance,
look in the SERVICE file (see above) for a list of people
who offer it.</p>

<p>Please do not send anything but bug reports to this
mailing list. For more information about Emacs mailing
lists, see the file
/usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/MAILINGLISTS.</p>

<p>UNRESTRICTIONS Emacs is free; anyone may redistribute
copies of Emacs to anyone under the terms stated in the
Emacs General Public License, a copy of which accompanies
each copy of Emacs and which also appears in the reference
manual.</p>

<p>Copies of Emacs may sometimes be received packaged with
distributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in
the scope of any license covering those systems. Such
inclusion violates the terms on which distribution is
permitted. In fact, the primary purpose of the General
Public License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any
other restric- tions to redistribution of Emacs.</p>

<p>Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend
Emacs, and urges that you contribute your extensions to the
GNU library. Eventually GNU (Gnus Not Unix) will be a
complete replacement for Unix. Everyone will be free to use,
copy, study and change the GNU system.</p>
