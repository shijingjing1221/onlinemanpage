<p>NAME restorecon - restore file(s) default SELinux
security contexts.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS restorecon [-o outfilename ] [-R] [-n] [-p]
[-v] [-e directory ] path- name...</p>

<p>restorecon -f infilename [-o outfilename ] [-e directory
] [-R] [-n] [-p] [-v] [-F]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the restorecon
program.</p>

<p>This program is primarily used to reset the security
context (type) (extended attributes) on one or more
files.</p>

<p>It can be run at any time to correct errors, to add
support for new policy, or with the -n option it can just
check whether the file con- texts are all as you expect.</p>

<p>If a file object does not have a context, restorecon
will write the default context to the file object s extended
attributes. If a file object has a context, restorecon will
only modify the type portion of the security context. The -F
option will force a replacement of the entire context.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i ignore files that do not exist</p>

<p>-f infilename infilename contains a list of files to be
processed by applica- tion. Use - for stdin.</p>

<p>-e directory directory to exclude (repeat option for
more than one direc- tory.)</p>

<p>-R -r change files and directories file labels
recursively</p>

<p>-n dont change any file labels.</p>

<p>-o outfilename save list of files with incorrect context
in outfilename.</p>

<p>-p show progress by printing * every 1000 files.</p>

<p>-v show changes in file labels.</p>

<p>-F Force reset of context to match file_context for
customizable files, and the default file context, changing
the user, role, range portion as well as the type.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS pathname... The pathname for the file(s) to be
relabeled.</p>

<p>NOTE restorecon does not follow symbolic links.</p>
