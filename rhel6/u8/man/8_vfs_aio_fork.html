<p>NAME vfs_aio_fork - implement async I/O in Samba vfs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = aio_fork</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The aio_fork VFS module enables async I/O for Samba on
platforms where the system level Posix AIO interface is
insufficient. Posix AIO can suffer from severe limitations.
For example, on some Linux versions the real-time signals
that it uses are broken under heavy load. Other systems only
allow AIO when special kernel modules are loaded or only
allow a certain system-wide amount of async requests being
scheduled. Systems based on glibc (most Linux systems) only
allow a single outstanding request per file descriptor.</p>

<p>To work around all these limitations, the aio_fork
module was written. It uses forked helper processes instead
of the internal Posix AIO interface to create
asynchronousity for read and write calls. It has no
parameters, it will create helper processes when async
requests come in as needed. Idle helper processes will be
removed every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Straight forward use:</p>

<p>[cooldata] path = /data/ice vfs objects = aio_fork</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.6.0 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
