<p>CLOCK(3) Linux Programmer s Manual CLOCK(3)</p>

<p>NAME clock - Determine processor time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>clock_t clock(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The clock() function returns an
approximation of processor time used by the program.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The value returned is the CPU time used so
far as a clock_t; to get the number of seconds used, divide
by CLOCKS_PER_SEC. If the processor time used is not
available or its value cannot be represented, the function
returns the value (clock_t) -1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX requires
that CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 independent of the actual
resolution.</p>

<p>NOTES The C standard allows for arbitrary values at the
start of the program; subtract the value returned from a
call to clock() at the start of the program to get maximum
portability.</p>

<p>Note that the time can wrap around. On a 32-bit system
where CLOCKS_PER_SEC equals 1000000 this function will
return the same value approximately every 72 minutes.</p>

<p>On several other implementations, the value returned by
clock() also includes the times of any children whose status
has been collected via wait(2) (or another wait-type call).
Linux does not include the times of waited-for children in
the value returned by clock(). The times(2) function, which
explicitly returns (separate) information about the caller
and its children, may be preferable.</p>
