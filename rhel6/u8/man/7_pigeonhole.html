<p>PIGEONHOLE(7) Pigeonhole PIGEONHOLE(7)</p>

<p>NAME pigeonhole - Overview of the Pigeonhole
project&rsquo;s Sieve support for the Dovecot secure IMAP
and POP3 server</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Pigeonhole project
&lt;http://pigeonhole.dovecot.org&gt; adds support for the
Sieve language (RFC 5228) and the ManageSieve protocol (RFC
5804) to the Dovecot Secure IMAP and POP3 Server
(dovecot(1)). In the literal sense, a pigeonhole is a a hole
or recess inside a dovecot for pigeons to nest in. It is,
however, also the name for one of a series of small, open
compartments in a cabinet used for filing or sorting mail.
As a verb, it describes the act of putting an item into one
of those pigeonholes. The name &quot;Pigeonhole&quot;
therefore well describes an impor- tant part of the
functionality that this project adds to Dovecot: sort- ing
and filing e-mail messages.</p>

<p>The Sieve language is used to specify how e-mail needs
to be processed. By writing Sieve scripts, users can
customize how messages are deliv- ered, e.g. whether they
are forwarded or stored in special folders. Unwanted
messages can be discarded or rejected, and, when the user is
not available, the Sieve interpreter can send an automated
reply. Above all, the Sieve language is meant to be simple,
extensible and system independent. And, unlike most other
mail filtering script languages, it does not allow users to
execute arbitrary programs. This is particu- larly useful to
prevent virtual users from having full access to the mail
store. The intention of the language is to make it
impossible for users to do anything more complex (and
dangerous) than write simple mail filters.</p>

<p>Using the ManageSieve protocol, users can upload their
Sieve scripts remotely, without needing direct filesystem
access through FTP or SCP. Additionally, a ManageSieve
server always makes sure that uploaded scripts are valid,
preventing compile failures at mail delivery.</p>

<p>The Pigeonhole project provides the following items:</p>

<p>&middot; The LDA Sieve plugin for Dovecot&rsquo;s Local
Delivery Agent (LDA) (dovecot-lda(1)) that facilitates the
actual Sieve filtering upon delivery.</p>

<p>&middot; The ManageSieve Service that implements the
ManageSieve protocol through which users can remotely manage
Sieve scripts on the server.</p>

<p>&middot; Command line tools that provide the means to
manually compile, analyse and test Sieve scripts.</p>

<p>The functionality and configuration of the LDA Sieve
plugin and the ManageSieve service is described in detail in
the README and INSTALL files contained in the Pigeonhole
package and in the Dovecot Wiki
&lt;http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Pigeonhole&gt;.</p>

<p>The following command line tools are available:</p>

<p>sievec(1) Compiles Sieve scripts into a binary
representation for later execution.</p>

<p>sieve-test(1) The universal Sieve test tool for testing
the effect of a Sieve script on a particular message.</p>

<p>sieve-dump(1) Dumps the content of a Sieve binary file
for (development) debugging purposes.</p>

output, to the Dovecot Mailing List
