<p>REGULATOR_SET_OPTIMU(9) API reference
REGULATOR_SET_OPTIMU(9)</p>

<p>NAME regulator_set_optimum_mode - set regulator optimum
operating mode</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int regulator_set_optimum_mode(struct regulator
* regulator, int uA_load);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS regulator regulator source</p>

<p>uA_load load current</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Notifies the regulator core of a new device
load. This is then used by DRMS (if enabled by constraints)
to set the most efficient regulator operating mode for the
new regulator loading.</p>

<p>Consumer devices notify their supply regulator of the
maximum power they will require (can be taken from device
datasheet in the power consumption tables) when they change
operational status and hence power state. Examples of
operational state changes that can affect power</p>

<p>CONSUMPTION ARE -</p>

<p>o Device is opened / closed. o Device I/O is about to
begin or has just finished. o Device is idling in between
work.</p>

<p>This information is also exported via sysfs to
userspace.</p>

<p>DRMS will sum the total requested load on the regulator
and change to the most efficient operating mode if platform
constraints allow.</p>

<p>Returns the new regulator mode or error.</p>
