<p>GETUNWIND(2) Linux System Calls GETUNWIND(2)</p>

<p>NAME getunwind - copy the unwind data to callers
buffer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;syscall.h&gt; #include
&lt;linux/unwind.h&gt;</p>

<p>long getunwind (void *buf, size_t buf_size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sys_getunwind function returns size of
unwind table, which describes gate page (kernel code that is
mapped into user space).</p>

<p>The unwind data is copied to the buffer buf, which has
size buf_size. The data is copied only if buf_size is
greater than or equal to the size of the unwind data and buf
is not NULL. The system call returns the size of the unwind
data in both cases.</p>

<p>The first part of the unwind data contains an unwind
table. The rest contains the associated unwind info in
random order. The unwind table contains a table looking
like:</p>

<p>u64 start; (64-bit address of start of function) u64
end; (64-bit address of start of function) u64 info;
(BUF-relative offset to unwind info)</p>

<p>An entry with a START address of zero is the end of
table. For more information about the format you can see the
IA-64 Software Conventions and Runtime Architecture.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The sys_getunwind function returns size of
unwind table.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sys_getunwind function fails with EFAULT if
the unwind info cant be stored in the space specified by the
buf argument.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This system call is available only on the
IA-64 architecture.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This system call has been deprecated.
It s highly recommended to get at the kernels unwind info by
the gate DSO. The address of the ELF header for this DSO is
passed to user level via AT_SYSINFO_EHDR.</p>

<p>The system call is not available to application programs
as a function; it can be called using the syscall(2)
function.</p>
