<p>NAME fonttosfnt - Wrap a bitmap font in a sfnt
(TrueType) wrapper</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fonttosfnt [ options ] -o file.ttf [ -- ]
font...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Wrap a bitmap font or a set of bitmap fonts
in a sfnt (TrueType or OpenType) wrapper.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Be verbose.</p>

<p>-c Do not crop glyphs. This usually increases file size,
but may sometimes yield a modest decrease in file size for
small charac- ter cell fonts (terminal fonts).</p>

<p>-b Write byte-aligned glyph data. By default, unaligned
data is written, which yields a smaller file size.</p>

<p>-r Do not reencode fonts. By default, fonts are
reencoded to Uni- code whenever possible.</p>

<p>-g n Set the type of scalable glyphs that we write. If n
is 0, no scalable glyphs are written; this is legal but
confuses most current software. If n is 1, a single scalable
glyph (the unde- fined glyph) is written; this is
recommended, but triggers a bug in current versions of
FreeType. If n is 2 (the default), a sufficiently high
number of blank glyphs are written, which works with
FreeType but increases file size.</p>

<p>-m n Set the type of scalable metrics that we write. If
n is 0, no scalable metrics are written, which may or may
not be legal. If n is 1, full metrics for a single glyph are
written, and only left sidebearing values are written for
the other glyphs. If n is 2, scalable metrics for all glyphs
are written, which increases file size and is not
recommended. The default is 1.</p>

<p>-- End of options.</p>

<p>BUGS Some of the font-level values, notably sub- and
superscript positions, are dummy values.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), Xserver(1), Xft(3x). Fonts in X11.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The version of Fonttosfnt included in this X.Org
Foundation release was originally written by Juliusz
Chroboczek &lt;jch@freedesktop.org&gt; for the XFree86
project.</p>
