<p>NAME pamslice - extract one line of values out of a
Netpbm image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamslice {-row=rownumber |
-column=columnnumber} [-plane=planenumber] [imagefile]</p>

<p>OPTION USAGE All options can be abbreviated to their
shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of
one. You may separate an option name and its value with
white space instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamslice extracts one line of tuples (pixels) out of a
Netpbm image and prints their values in a table. A line
means a row or column. It shows you a one-dimensional cross
section of a two-dimensional image. (With the -plane option,
it can be thought of as a one-dimensional cross-section of a
three-dimensional image).</p>

<p>The table has one line per tuple, consisting of
blank-separated ASCII decimal numbers. The first number is
the column number if you speci- fied a row slice or the row
number if you specified a column slice. The rest of the
numbers are the sample values in plane number order. For a
PBM or PGM input, there is only one plane. For a PPM input,
Plane 0 is red, Plane 1 is green, and Plane 2 is blue. See
the speci- fications of the image formats for details on
exactly what these num- bers mean.</p>

<p>If you want to see all the pixels in a PPM, PGM, or PBM
image in ASCII decimal, pnmtoplainpnm is a good way to do
that.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -row=rownumber This indicates that the slice is
to be horizontal -- i.e. one row of the image -- and
indicates which row. Rows are numbered from the top starting
with 0.</p>

<p>You cannot specify both -row and -column.</p>

<p>-column=colnumber This indicates that the slice is to be
vertical -- i.e. one column of the image -- and indicates
which column. Columns are numbered from the left starting
with 0.</p>

<p>You cannot specify both -row and -column.</p>

<p>-plane=planenumber This specifies that you are
interested in only one plane of the image and which one.
Planes are numbered from 0 and have meanings that vary on
the type of image. In a PPM image, Plane 0 is red, Plane 1
is green, and Plane 2 is blue.</p>

<p>If you dont specify -plane, you get all the planes --
each line of output has multiple numbers in addition to the
sequence number. If you do specify -plane, each line of
output contains one number in addition to the sequence
number.</p>

<p>-xmgr This option causes pamslice to format the output
as input for a xmgr so you can plot it. The only difference
this option makes is that it adds header information to the
beginning of the output.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamslice replaced pgmslice in Netpbm 10.3 (June
2002). It was backward compatible, but worked on Netpbm
images other than PGM and PBM and added the -plane and -xmgr
options.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Jos Dingjan &lt;jos@tuatha.org&gt; wrote pgmslice
after being unable to find the source code to Marco
Beijersbergens program with the same name. Bryan Henderson
converted it to pamslice.</p>
