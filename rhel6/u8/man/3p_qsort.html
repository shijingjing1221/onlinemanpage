<p>QSORT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QSORT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qsort - sort a table of data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void qsort(void *base, size_t nel, size_t width, int
(*compar)(const void *, const void *));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The qsort() function shall sort an array of
nel objects, the initial element of which is pointed to by
base. The size of each object, in bytes, is specified by the
width argument. If the nel argument has the value zero, the
comparison function pointed to by compar shall not be called
and no rearrangement shall take place.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the comparison
function pointed to by compar does not alter the contents of
the array. The implementation may reorder elements of the
array between calls to the comparison func- tion, but shall
not alter the contents of any individual element.</p>

<p>When the same objects (consisting of width bytes,
irrespective of their current positions in the array) are
passed more than once to the com- parison function, the
results shall be consistent with one another. That is, they
shall define a total ordering on the array.</p>

<p>The contents of the array shall be sorted in ascending
order according to a comparison function. The compar
argument is a pointer to the com- parison function, which is
called with two arguments that point to the elements being
compared. The application shall ensure that the function
returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than 0,
if the first argument is considered respectively less than,
equal to, or greater than the second. If two members compare
as equal, their order in the sorted array is
unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The qsort() function shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The comparison function need not
compare every byte, so arbitrary data may be contained in
the elements in addition to the values being com- pared.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The requirement that each argument (hereafter
referred to as p) to the comparison function is a pointer to
elements of the array implies that for every call, for each
argument separately, all of the following expressions are
nonzero:</p>

<p>((char *)p - (char *)base) % width == 0 (char *)p &gt;=
(char *)base (char *)p &lt; (char *)base + nel * width</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
