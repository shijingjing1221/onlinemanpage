<p>NICE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual NICE(2)</p>

<p>NAME nice - change process priority</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int nice(int inc);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>nice(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nice() adds inc to the nice value for the
calling process. (A higher nice value means a low priority.)
Only the superuser may specify a negative increment, or
priority increase. The range for nice values is described in
getpriority(2).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the new nice value is returned
(but see NOTES below). On error, -1 is returned, and errno
is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM The calling process attempted to increase
its priority by sup- plying a negative inc but has
insufficient privileges. Under Linux the CAP_SYS_NICE
capability is required. (But see the discussion of the
RLIMIT_NICE resource limit in setrlimit(2).)</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. However, the
Linux and (g)libc (earlier than glibc 2.2.4) return value is
non-standard, see below. SVr4 docu- ments an additional
EINVAL error code.</p>

<p>NOTES SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001 specify that nice() should
return the new nice value. However, the Linux syscall and
the nice() library function pro- vided in older versions of
(g)libc (earlier than glibc 2.2.4) return 0 on success. The
new nice value can be found using getpriority(2).</p>

<p>Since glibc 2.2.4, nice() is implemented as a library
function that calls getpriority(2) to obtain the new nice
value to be returned to the caller. With this
implementation, a successful call can legitimately return
-1. To reliably detect an error, set errno to 0 before the
call, and check its value when nice() returns -1.</p>
