<p>NAME licensecheck - simple license checker for source
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS licensecheck --help|--version</p>

<p>licensecheck [--no-conf] [--verbose] [--copyright]
[-l|--lines=N] [-i|--ignore=regex] [-c|--check=regex]
[-r|--recursive] list of files and directories to check</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION licensecheck attempts to determine the
license that applies to each file passed to it, by searching
the start of the file for text belonging to various
licenses.</p>

<p>If any of the arguments passed are directories,
licensecheck will add the files contained within to the list
of files to process.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --verbose --no-verbose Specify whether to output
the text being processed from each file before the
corresponding license information.</p>

<p>Default is to be quiet.</p>

<p>-l=N --lines=N Specify the number of lines of each files
header which should be parsed for license information.
(Default is 60).</p>

<p>-i=regex --ignore=regex When processing the list of
files and directories, the regular expression specified by
this option will be used to indicate those which should not
be considered (e.g. backup files, VCS metadata).</p>

<p>-r --recursive Specify that the contents of directories
should be added recursively.</p>

<p>-c=regex --check=regex Specify a pattern against which
filenames will be matched in order to decide which files to
check the license of.</p>

<p>The default includes common source files.</p>

<p>--copyright Also display copyright text found within the
file</p>

<p>--no-conf --noconf Do not read any configuration files.
This can only be used as the first option given on the
command-line.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES The two configuration files
/etc/rpmdevtools/devscripts.conf and ~/.devscripts are
sourced by a shell in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
configuration file settings. Environment variable settings
are ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised
variables are:</p>

<p>LICENSECHECK_VERBOSE If this is set to yes, then it is
the same as the --verbose command line parameter being used.
The default is no.</p>

<p>LICENSECHECK_PARSELINES If this is set to a positive
number then the specified number of lines at the start of
each file will be read whilst attempting to determine the
license(s) in use. This is equivalent to the --lines command
line option.</p>
