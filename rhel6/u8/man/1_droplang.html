<p>NAME droplang - remove a PostgreSQL procedural
language</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS droplang [ connection-option... ] langname [
dbname ]</p>

<p>droplang [ connection-option... ] [ --list ] [ -l ]
dbname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION droplang is a utility for removing an
existing programming language from a PostgreSQL database.
droplang can drop any procedural language, even those not
supplied by the PostgreSQL distribution.</p>

<p>Although backend programming languages can be removed
directly using several SQL commands, it is recommended to
use droplang because it per- forms a number of checks and is
much easier to use. See DROP LANGUAGE [drop_language(7)] for
more.</p>

<p>OPTIONS droplang accepts the following command line
arguments:</p>

<p>langname Specifies the name of the backend programming
language to be removed.</p>

<p>[-d] dbname</p>

<p>[--dbname] dbname Specifies from which database the
language should be removed. The default is to use the
database with the same name as the current system user.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Display SQL commands as they are executed.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>--list Show a list of already installed languages in the
target database.</p>

<p>droplang also accepts the following command line
arguments for connec- tion parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If host begins with a slash, it
is used as the direc- tory for the Unix domain socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the Internet TCP/IP port or local
Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is
listening for connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--no-password Never issue a password prompt. If the
server requires password authentication and a password is
not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force droplang to prompt for a password
before connecting to a database.</p>

<p>This option is never essential, since droplang will
automati- cally prompt for a password if the server demands
password authentication. However, droplang will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATABASE</p>

<p>PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the envi- ronment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Most error messages are self-explanatory. If
not, run droplang with the --echo option and see under the
respective SQL command for details. Also, any default
connection settings and environment variables used by the
libpq front-end library will apply.</p>

<p>NOTES Use createlang(1) to add a language.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To remove the language pltcl:</p>

<p>$ droplang pltcl dbname</p>
