<p>NAME ppmdist - simplistic grayscale assignment for
machine generated, color images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmdist</p>

<p>[-intensity|-frequency]</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmdist reads a PPM image as input and performs a
simplistic grayscale assignment intended for use with
grayscale or bitmap printers.</p>

<p>Often conversion from ppm to pgm will yield an image
with contrast too low for good printer output. The program
maximizes contrast between the gray levels output.</p>

<p>A ppm input of n colors is read, and a pgm of n gray
levels is written. The gray levels take on the values
0..n-1, while maxval takes on n-1.</p>

<p>The mapping from color to stepped grayscale can be
performed in order of input pixel intensity, or input pixel
frequency (number of repeti- tions).</p>

<p>This program is helpful only for images with a very
small number of colors.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -frequency Sort input colors by the number of
times a color appears in the input, before mapping to evenly
distributed graylevels of out- put.</p>

<p>-intensity Sort input colors by their grayscale
intensity, before mapping to evenly distributed graylevels
of output. This is the default.</p>
