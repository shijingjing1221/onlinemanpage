<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures manage a collection of
bitmaps (one-plane pixmaps) being used by an application.
The procedures allow bitmaps to be re- used efficiently,
thereby avoiding server overhead, and also allow bitmaps to
be named with character strings.</p>

<p>Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj returns a Pixmap identifier for a
bitmap that matches the description in objPtr and is
suitable for use in tkwin. It re-uses an existing bitmap, if
possible, and creates a new one other- wise. ObjPtrs value
must have one of the following forms:</p>

<p>@fileName FileName must be the name of a file containing
a bitmap description in the standard X11 or X10 for-
mat.</p>

<p>name Name must be the name of a bitmap defined previ-
ously with a call to Tk_DefineBitmap. The follow- ing names
are pre-defined by Tk:</p>

<p>error The international dont symbol: a circle with a
diagonal line across it.</p>

<p>gray75 75% gray: a checkerboard pattern where three out
of four bits are on.</p>

<p>gray50 50% gray: a checkerboard pattern where every
other bit is on.</p>

<p>gray25 25% gray: a checkerboard pattern where one out of
every four bits is on.</p>

<p>gray12 12.5% gray: a pattern where one-eighth of the
bits are on, consisting of every fourth pixel in every other
row.</p>

<p>hourglass An hourglass symbol.</p>

<p>info A large letter i.</p>

<p>questhead The silhouette of a human head, with a
question mark in it.</p>

<p>question A large question-mark.</p>

<p>warning A large exclamation point.</p>

<p>In addition, the following pre-defined names are
available only on the Macintosh platform:</p>

<p>document A generic document.</p>

<p>stationery Document stationery.</p>

<p>edition The edition symbol.</p>

<p>application Generic application icon.</p>

<p>accessory A desk accessory.</p>

<p>folder Generic folder icon.</p>

<p>pfolder A locked folder.</p>

<p>trash A trash can.</p>

<p>floppy A floppy disk.</p>

<p>ramdisk A floppy disk with chip.</p>

<p>cdrom A cd disk icon.</p>

<p>preferences A folder with prefs symbol.</p>

<p>querydoc A database document icon.</p>

<p>stop A stop sign.</p>

<p>note A face with balloon words.</p>

<p>caution A triangle with an exclamation point.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj returns
an identifier for the requested bitmap. If an error occurs
in creating the bitmap, such as when objPtr refers to a
non-existent file, then None is returned and an error
message is left in interps result if interp is not NULL.
Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj caches information about the return
value in objPtr, which speeds up future calls to procedures
such as Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj and Tk_GetBitmapFromObj.</p>

<p>Tk_GetBitmap is identical to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj
except that the description of the bitmap is specified with
a string instead of an object. This prevents Tk_GetBitmap
from caching the return value, so Tk_GetBitmap is less
efficient than Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj.</p>

<p>Tk_GetBitmapFromObj returns the token for an existing
bitmap, given the window and description used to create the
bitmap. Tk_GetBitmapFromObj does not actually create the
bitmap; the bitmap must already have been created with a
previous call to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or Tk_GetBitmap. The
return value is cached in objPtr, which speeds up future
calls to Tk_GetBitmapFromObj with the same objPtr and
tkwin.</p>

<p>Tk_DefineBitmap associates a name with in-memory bitmap
data so that the name can be used in later calls to
Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or Tk_Get- Bitmap. The nameId argument
gives a name for the bitmap; it must not previously have
been used in a call to Tk_DefineBitmap. The arguments
source, width, and height describe the bitmap.
Tk_DefineBitmap nor- mally returns TCL_OK; if an error
occurs (e.g. a bitmap named nameId has already been defined)
then TCL_ERROR is returned and an error mes- sage is left in
interp-&gt;result. Note: Tk_DefineBitmap expects the memory
pointed to by source to be static: Tk_DefineBitmap does not
make a private copy of this memory, but uses the bytes
pointed to by source later in calls to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj
or Tk_GetBitmap.</p>

<p>Typically Tk_DefineBitmap is used by #include-ing a
bitmap file directly into a C program and then referencing
the variables defined by the file. For example, suppose
there exists a file stip.bitmap, which was created by the
bitmap program and contains a stipple pattern. The following
code uses Tk_DefineBitmap to define a new bitmap named foo:
Pixmap bitmap; #include &quot;stip.bitmap&quot;
Tk_DefineBitmap(interp, &quot;foo&quot;, stip_bits,
stip_width, stip_height); ... bitmap = Tk_GetBitmap(interp,
tkwin, &quot;foo&quot;); This code causes the bitmap file to
be read at compile-time and incor- porates the bitmap
information into the program s executable image. The same
bitmap file could be read at run-time using Tk_GetBitmap:
Pixmap bitmap; bitmap = Tk_GetBitmap(interp, tkwin,
&quot;@stip.bitmap&quot;); The second form is a bit more
flexible (the file could be modified after the program has
been compiled, or a different string could be provided to
read a different file), but it is a little slower and
requires the bitmap file to exist separately from the
program.</p>

<p>Tk maintains a database of all the bitmaps that are
currently in use. Whenever possible, it will return an
existing bitmap rather than creat- ing a new one. When a
bitmap is no longer used, Tk will release it automatically.
This approach can substantially reduce server overhead, so
Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj and Tk_GetBitmap should generally be
used in preference to Xlib procedures like
XReadBitmapFile.</p>

<p>The bitmaps returned by Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj and
Tk_GetBitmap are shared, so callers should never modify
them. If a bitmap must be modi- fied dynamically, then it
should be created by calling Xlib procedures such as
XReadBitmapFile or XCreatePixmap directly.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_NameOfBitmap is roughly the inverse of
Tk_GetBitmap. Given an X Pixmap argument, it returns the
textual description that was passed to Tk_GetBitmap when the
bitmap was created. Bitmap must have been the return value
from a previous call to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or
Tk_GetBitmap.</p>

<p>Tk_SizeOfBitmap returns the dimensions of its bitmap
argument in the words pointed to by the widthPtr and
heightPtr arguments. As with Tk_NameOfBitmap, bitmap must
have been created by Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or
Tk_GetBitmap.</p>

<p>When a bitmap is no longer needed, Tk_FreeBitmapFromObj
or Tk_FreeBitmap should be called to release it. For
Tk_FreeBitmapFromObj the bitmap to release is specified with
the same information used to create it; for Tk_FreeBitmap
the bitmap to release is specified with its Pixmap token.
There should be exactly one call to Tk_FreeBitmapFromObj or
Tk_FreeBitmap for each call to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or
Tk_GetBitmap.</p>

<p>BUGS In determining whether an existing bitmap can be
used to satisfy a new request, Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj and
Tk_GetBitmap consider only the imme- diate value of the
string description. For example, when a file name is passed
to Tk_GetBitmap, Tk_GetBitmap will assume it is safe to re-
use an existing bitmap created from the same file name: it
will not check to see whether the file itself has changed,
or whether the cur- rent directory has changed, thereby
causing the name to refer to a dif- ferent file.</p>
