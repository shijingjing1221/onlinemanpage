<p>virt-inspector2(1) Virtualization Support
virt-inspector2(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-inspector2 - Display operating system version
and other information about a virtual machine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-inspector2 [--options] -d domname</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img
...]</p>

<p>Old-style:</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 domname</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-inspector2 examines a virtual machine
or disk image and tries to determine the version of the
operating system and other information about the virtual
machine.</p>

<p>Virt-inspector2 produces XML output for feeding into
other programs.</p>

<p>In the normal usage, use &quot;virt-inspector2 -d
domname&quot; where &quot;domname&quot; is the libvirt
domain (see: &quot;virsh list --all&quot;).</p>

<p>You can also run virt-inspector2 directly on disk images
from a single virtual machine. Use &quot;virt-inspector2 -a
disk.img&quot;. In rare cases a domain has several block
devices, in which case you should list several -a options
one after another, with the first corresponding to the
guests &quot;/dev/sda&quot;, the second to the guests
&quot;/dev/sdb&quot; and so on.</p>

<p>You can also run virt-inspector2 on install disks, live
CDs, bootable USB keys and similar.</p>

<p>Virt-inspector2 can only inspect and report upon one
domain at a time. To inspect several virtual machines, you
have to run virt-inspector2 several times (for example, from
a shell script for-loop).</p>

<p>Because virt-inspector2 needs direct access to guest
images, it wont normally work over remote libvirt
connections.</p>

<p>All of the information available from virt-inspector2 is
also available through the core libguestfs inspection API
(see &quot;INSPECTION&quot; in guestfs(3)). The same
information can also be fetched using guestfish or via
libguestfs bindings in many programming languages (see
&quot;GETTING INSPECTION DATA FROM THE LIBGUESTFS
API&quot;).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>-a file --add file Add file which should be a disk image
from a virtual machine. If the virtual machine has multiple
block devices, you must supply all of them with separate -a
options.</p>

<p>The format of the disk image is auto-detected. To
override this and force a particular format use the
--format=.. option.</p>

<p>-c URI --connect URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>Libvirt is only used if you specify a
&quot;domname&quot; on the command line. If you specify
guest block devices directly (-a), then libvirt is not used
at all.</p>

<p>-d guest --domain guest Add all the disks from the named
libvirt guest. Domain UUIDs can be used instead of
names.</p>

<p>--echo-keys When prompting for keys and passphrases,
virt-inspector2 normally turns echoing off so you cannot see
what you are typing. If you are not worried about Tempest
attacks and there is no one else in the room you can specify
this flag to see what you are typing.</p>

<p>--format=raw|qcow2|.. --format Specify the format of
disk images given on the command line. If this is omitted
then the format is autodetected from the content of the disk
image.</p>

<p>If disk images are requested from libvirt, then this
program asks libvirt for this information. In this case, the
value of the format parameter is ignored.</p>

<p>If working with untrusted raw-format guest disk images,
you should ensure the format is always specified.</p>

<p>--keys-from-stdin Read key or passphrase parameters from
stdin. The default is to try to read passphrases from the
user by opening &quot;/dev/tty&quot;.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose messages for debugging.</p>

<p>-V --version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-x Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.</p>

<p>--xpath query Perform an XPath query on the XML on
stdin, and print the result on stdout. In this mode
virt-inspector2 simply runs an XPath query; all other
inspection functions are disabled. See &quot;XPATH
QUERIES&quot; below for some examples.</p>

<p>OLD-STYLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS Previous versions of
virt-inspector2 allowed you to write either:</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 guestname</p>

<p>whereas in this version you should use -a or -d
respectively to avoid the confusing case where a disk image
might have the same name as a guest.</p>

<p>For compatibility the old style is still supported.</p>

<p>XML FORMAT The virt-inspector2 XML is described
precisely in a RELAX NG schema file
&quot;virt-inspector2.rng&quot; which is supplied with
libguestfs. This section is just an overview.</p>

<p>The top-level element is &lt;operatingsystems&gt;, and
it contains one or more &lt;operatingsystem&gt; elements.
You would only see more than one &lt;operatingsystem&gt;
element if the virtual machine is multi-boot, which is
vanishingly rare in real world VMs.</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystem&gt; In the &lt;operatingsystem&gt;
tag are various optional fields that describe the operating
system, its architecture, the descriptive &quot;product
name&quot; string, the type of OS and so on, as in this
example:</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt;
&lt;root&gt;/dev/sda2&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;name&gt;windows&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;arch&gt;i386&lt;/arch&gt;
&lt;distro&gt;windows&lt;/distro&gt;
&lt;product_name&gt;Windows 7
Enterprise&lt;/product_name&gt;
&lt;product_variant&gt;Client&lt;/product_variant&gt;
&lt;major_version&gt;6&lt;/major_version&gt;
&lt;minor_version&gt;1&lt;/minor_version&gt;
&lt;windows_systemroot&gt;/Windows&lt;/windows_systemroot&gt;
&lt;format&gt;installed&lt;/format&gt;</p>

<p>In brief, &lt;name&gt; is the class of operating system
(something like &quot;linux&quot; or &quot;windows&quot;),
&lt;distro&gt; is the distribution (eg. &quot;fedora&quot;
but many other distros are recognized) and &lt;arch&gt; is
the guest architecture. The other fields are fairly
self-explanatory, but because these fields are taken
directly from the libguestfs inspection API you can find
precise information from &quot;INSPECTION&quot; in
guestfs(3).</p>

<p>The &lt;root&gt; element is the root filesystem device,
but from the point of view of libguestfs (block devices may
have completely different names inside the VM itself).</p>

<p>&lt;mountpoints&gt; Un*x-like guests typically have
multiple filesystems which are mounted at various
mountpoints, and these are described in the
&lt;mountpoints&gt; element which looks like this:</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;mountpoints&gt; &lt;mountpoint
dev=&quot;/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root&quot;&gt;/&lt;/mountpoint&gt;
&lt;mountpoint
dev=&quot;/dev/sda1&quot;&gt;/boot&lt;/mountpoint&gt;
&lt;/mountpoints&gt;</p>

<p>As with &lt;root&gt;, devices are from the point of view
of libguestfs, and may have completely different names
inside the guest. Only mountable filesystems appear in this
list, not things like swap devices.</p>

<p>&lt;filesystems&gt; &lt;filesystems&gt; is like
&lt;mountpoints&gt; but covers all filesystems belonging to
the guest, including swap and empty partitions. (In the rare
case of a multi-boot guest, it covers filesystems belonging
to this OS or shared with this OS and other OSes).</p>

<p>You might see something like this:</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;filesystems&gt; &lt;filesystem
dev=&quot;/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root&quot;&gt;
&lt;type&gt;ext4&lt;/type&gt;
&lt;label&gt;Fedora-13-x86_64&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;uuid&gt;e6a4db1e-15c2-477b-ac2a-699181c396aa&lt;/uuid&gt;
&lt;/filesystem&gt;</p>

<p>The optional elements within &lt;filesystem&gt; are the
filesystem type, the label, and the UUID.</p>

<p>&lt;applications&gt; The related elements
&lt;package_format&gt;, &lt;package_management&gt; and
&lt;applications&gt; describe applications installed in the
virtual machine.</p>

<p>&lt;package_format&gt;, if present, describes the
packaging system used. Typical values would be
&quot;rpm&quot; and &quot;deb&quot;.</p>

<p>&lt;package_management&gt;, if present, describes the
package manager. Typical values include &quot;yum&quot;,
&quot;up2date&quot; and &quot;apt&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;applications&gt; lists the packages or applications
installed.</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;applications&gt; &lt;application&gt;
&lt;name&gt;coreutils&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;version&gt;8.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;release&gt;1&lt;/release&gt; &lt;/application&gt;</p>

<p>The version and release fields may not be available for
some types guests. Other fields are possible, see
&quot;guestfs_inspect_list_applications&quot; in
guestfs(3).</p>

<p>&lt;drive_mappings&gt; For operating systems like
Windows which use drive letters, virt- inspector2 is able to
find out how drive letters map to filesystems.</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;drive_mappings&gt; &lt;drive_mapping
name=&quot;C&quot;&gt;/dev/sda2&lt;/drive_mapping&gt;
&lt;drive_mapping
name=&quot;E&quot;&gt;/dev/sdb1&lt;/drive_mapping&gt;
&lt;/drive_mappings&gt;</p>

<p>In the example above, drive C maps to the filesystem on
the second partition on the first disk, and drive E maps to
the filesystem on the first partition on the second
disk.</p>

<p>Note that this only covers permanent local filesystem
mappings, not things like network shares. Furthermore NTFS
volume mount points may not be listed here.</p>

<p>&lt;icon&gt; Virt-inspector2 is sometimes able to
extract an icon or logo for the guest. The icon is returned
as base64-encoded PNG data. Note that the icon can be very
large and high quality.</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;icon&gt; iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGAAAABg[.......] [...
many lines of base64 data ...] &lt;/icon&gt;</p>

<p>To display the icon, you have to extract it and convert
the base64 data back to a binary file. Use an XPath query or
simply an editor to extract the data, then use the coreutils
base64(1) program to do the conversion back to a PNG
file:</p>

<p>base64 -i -d &lt; icon.data &gt; icon.png</p>

<p>INSPECTING INSTALL DISKS, LIVE CDs Virt-inspector2 can
detect some operating system installers on install disks,
live CDs, bootable USB keys and more.</p>

<p>In this case the &lt;format&gt; tag will contain
&quot;installer&quot; and other fields may be present to
indicate a live CD, network installer, or one part of a
multipart CD. For example:</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt;
&lt;root&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;name&gt;linux&lt;/name&gt; &lt;arch&gt;i386&lt;/arch&gt;
&lt;distro&gt;ubuntu&lt;/distro&gt;
&lt;product_name&gt;Ubuntu 10.10 &amp;quot;Maverick
Meerkat&amp;quot;&lt;/product_name&gt;
&lt;major_version&gt;10&lt;/major_version&gt;
&lt;minor_version&gt;10&lt;/minor_version&gt;
&lt;format&gt;installer&lt;/format&gt; &lt;live/&gt;</p>

<p>XPATH QUERIES Virt-inspector2 includes built in support
for running XPath queries. The reason for including XPath
support directly in virt-inspector2 is simply that there are
no good and widely available command line programs that can
do XPath queries. The only good one is xmlstarlet(1) and
that is not available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>

<p>To perform an XPath query, use the --xpath option. Note
that in this mode, virt-inspector2 simply reads XML from
stdin and outputs the query result on stdout. All other
inspection features are disabled in this mode.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>$ virt-inspector2 -d Guest | virt-inspector2 --xpath
&rsquo;//filesystems&rsquo; &lt;filesystems&gt;
&lt;filesystem dev=&quot;/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root&quot;&gt;
&lt;type&gt;ext4&lt;/type&gt; [...]</p>

<p>$ virt-inspector2 -d Guest | virt-inspector2 --xpath
&quot;string(//filesystem[@dev=&rsquo;/dev/sda1&rsquo;]/type)&quot;
ext4</p>

<p>$ virt-inspector2 -d Guest | virt-inspector2 --xpath
&rsquo;string(//icon)&rsquo; | base64 -i -d | display -
[displays the guest icon, if there is one]</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>

<p>GETTING INSPECTION DATA FROM THE LIBGUESTFS API In early
versions of libguestfs, virt-inspector2 was a large Perl
script that contained many heuristics for inspecting guests.
This had several problems: in order to do inspection from
other tools (like guestfish) we had to call out to this Perl
script; and it privileged Perl over other languages that
libguestfs supports.</p>

<p>By libguestfs 1.8 we had rewritten the Perl code in C,
and incorporated it all into the core libguestfs API
(guestfs(3)). Now virt-inspector2 is simply a thin C program
over the core C API. All of the inspection information is
available from all programming languages that libguestfs
supports, and from guestfish.</p>

<p>For a description of the C inspection API, read
&quot;INSPECTION&quot; in guestfs(3).</p>

<p>For example code using the C inspection API, look for
&quot;inspect-vm.c&quot; which ships with libguestfs.</p>

<p>&quot;inspect-vm.c&quot; has also been translated into
other languages. For example, &quot;inspect_vm.pl&quot; is
the Perl translation, and there are other translations for
OCaml, Python, etc. See &quot;USING LIBGUESTFS WITH OTHER
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES&quot; in guestfs(3) for a list of man
pages which contain this example code.</p>

<p>GETTING INSPECTION DATA FROM GUESTFISH If you use the
guestfish -i option, then the main C inspection API
&quot;guestfs_inspect_os&quot; in guestfs(3) is called. This
is equivalent to the guestfish command
&quot;inspect-os&quot;. You can also call this guestfish
command by hand.</p>

<p>&quot;inspect-os&quot; performs inspection on the
current disk image, returning the list of operating systems
found. Each OS is represented by its root filesystem device.
In the majority of cases, this command prints nothing (no
OSes found), or a single root device, but beware that it can
print multiple lines if there are multiple OSes or if there
is an install CD attached to the guest.</p>

<p>$ guestfish --ro -a F15x32.img &gt;&lt;fs&gt; run
&gt;&lt;fs&gt; inspect-os /dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root</p>

<p>Using the root device, you can fetch further information
about the guest:</p>

<p>&gt;&lt;fs&gt; inspect-get-type /dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root
linux &gt;&lt;fs&gt; inspect-get-distro
/dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root fedora &gt;&lt;fs&gt;
inspect-get-major-version /dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root 15
&gt;&lt;fs&gt; inspect-get-product-name
/dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root Fedora release 15 (Lovelock)</p>

<p>Limitations of guestfish make it hard to assign the root
device to a variable (since guestfish doesnt have
variables), so if you want to do this reproducibly you are
better off writing a script using one of the other languages
that the libguestfs API supports.</p>

<p>To list applications, you have to first mount up the
disks:</p>

<p>&gt;&lt;fs&gt; inspect-get-mountpoints
/dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root /: /dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root /boot:
/dev/vda1 &gt;&lt;fs&gt; mount-ro /dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root /
&gt;&lt;fs&gt; mount-ro /dev/vda1 /boot</p>

<p>and then call the inspect-list-applications API:</p>

<p>&gt;&lt;fs&gt; inspect-list-applications
/dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root | head -28 [0] = { app_name:
ConsoleKit app_display_name: app_epoch: 0 app_version: 0.4.5
app_release: 1.fc15 app_install_path: app_trans_path:
app_publisher: app_url: app_source_package: app_summary:
app_description: } [1] = { app_name: ConsoleKit-libs
app_display_name: app_epoch: 0 app_version: 0.4.5
app_release: 1.fc15 app_install_path: app_trans_path:
app_publisher: app_url: app_source_package: app_summary:
app_description: }</p>

<p>To display an icon for the guest, note that filesystems
must also be mounted as above. You can then do:</p>

<p>&gt;&lt;fs&gt; inspect-get-icon /dev/vg_f15x32/lv_root |
display -</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS This program returns 0 if successful, or
non-zero if there was an error.</p>
