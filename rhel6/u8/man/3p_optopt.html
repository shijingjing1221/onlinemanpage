<p>GETOPT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETOPT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getopt, optarg, opterr, optind, optopt - command
option parsing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getopt(int argc, char * const argv[], const char
*optstring); extern char *optarg; extern int optind, opterr,
optopt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getopt() function is a command-line
parser that shall follow Util- ity Syntax Guidelines 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guide-
lines.</p>

<p>The parameters argc and argv are the argument count and
argument array as passed to main() (see exec()). The
argument optstring is a string of recognized option
characters; if a character is followed by a colon, the
option takes an argument. All option characters allowed by
Utility Syntax Guideline 3 are allowed in optstring. The
implementation may accept other characters as an
extension.</p>

<p>The variable optind is the index of the next element of
the argv[] vec- tor to be processed. It shall be initialized
to 1 by the system, and getopt() shall update it when it
finishes with each element of argv[]. When an element of
argv[] contains multiple option characters, it is
unspecified how getopt() determines which options have
already been processed.</p>

<p>The getopt() function shall return the next option
character (if one is found) from argv that matches a
character in optstring, if there is one that matches. If the
option takes an argument, getopt() shall set the variable
optarg to point to the option-argument as follows:</p>

<p>1. If the option was the last character in the string
pointed to by an element of argv, then optarg shall contain
the next element of argv, and optind shall be incremented by
2. If the resulting value of optind is greater than argc,
this indicates a missing option- argument, and getopt()
shall return an error indication.</p>

<p>2. Otherwise, optarg shall point to the string following
the option character in that element of argv, and optind
shall be incremented by 1.</p>

<p>If, when getopt() is called:</p>

<p>argv[optind] is a null pointer* argv[optind] is not the
character - argv[optind] points to the string
&quot;-&quot;</p>

<p>getopt() shall return -1 without changing optind.
If:</p>

<p>argv[optind] points to the string &quot;--&quot;</p>

<p>getopt() shall return -1 after incrementing optind.</p>

<p>If getopt() encounters an option character that is not
contained in optstring, it shall return the question-mark (
? ) character. If it detects a missing option-argument, it
shall return the colon character (:) if the first character
of optstring was a colon, or a question- mark character ( ?)
otherwise. In either case, getopt() shall set the variable
optopt to the option character that caused the error. If the
application has not set the variable opterr to 0 and the
first character of optstring is not a colon, getopt() shall
also print a diagnostic message to stderr in the format
specified for the getopts utility.</p>

<p>The getopt() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The getopt() function shall return the next
option character specified on the command line.</p>

<p>A colon ( :) shall be returned if getopt() detects a
missing argu- ment and the first character of optstring was
a colon (:).</p>

<p>A question mark ( ? ) shall be returned if getopt()
encounters an option character not in optstring or detects a
missing argument and the first character of optstring was
not a colon (:).</p>

<p>Otherwise, getopt() shall return -1 when all command
line options are parsed.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Parsing Command Line Options The following code
fragment shows how you might process the arguments for a
utility that can take the mutually-exclusive options a and b
and the options f and o, both of which require
arguments:</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[ ]) { int c; int bflg,
aflg, errflg; char *ifile; char *ofile; extern char *optarg;
extern int optind, optopt; . . . while ((c = getopt(argc,
argv, &quot;:abf:o:&quot;)) != -1) { switch(c) { case: if
(bflg) errflg++; else aflg++; break; case: if (aflg)
errflg++; else { bflg++; bproc(); } break; case: ifile =
optarg; break; case: ofile = optarg; break; case: /* -f or
-o without operand */ fprintf(stderr, &quot;Option -%c
requires an operann&quot;, optopt); errflg++; break; case:
fprintf(stderr, &quot;Unrecognized option: -%n&quot;,
optopt); errflg++; } } if (errflg) { fprintf(stderr,
&quot;usage: . . . &quot;); exit(2); } for ( ; optind &lt;
argc; optind++) { if (access(argv[optind], R_OK)) { . . .
}</p>

<p>This code accepts any of the following as
equivalent:</p>

<p>cmd -ao arg path path cmd -a -o arg path path cmd -o arg
-a path path cmd -a -o arg -- path path cmd -a -oarg path
path cmd -aoarg path path</p>

<p>Checking Options and Arguments The following example
parses a set of command line options and prints messages to
standard output for each option and argument that it
encounters.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ...
int c; char *filename; extern char *optarg; extern int
optind, optopt, opterr; ... while ((c = getopt(argc, argv,
&quot;:abf:&quot;)) != -1) { switch(c) { case:
printf(&quot;a is sen&quot;); break; case: printf(&quot;b is
sen&quot;); break; case: filename = optarg;
printf(&quot;filename is %n&quot;, filename); break; case:
printf(&quot;-%c without filenamn&quot;, optopt); break;
case: printf(&quot;unknown arg %n&quot;, optopt); break; }
}</p>

<p>Selecting Options from the Command Line The following
example selects the type of database routines the user wants
to use based on the Options argument.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; ...
char *Options = &quot;hdbtl&quot;; ... int dbtype, i; char
c; char *st; ... dbtype = 0; while ((c = getopt(argc, argv,
Options)) != -1) { if ((st = strchr(Options, c)) != NULL) {
dbtype = st - Options; break; } }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The getopt() function is only required
to support option characters included in Utility Syntax
Guideline 3. Many historical implementations of getopt()
support other characters as options. This is an allowed
extension, but applications that use extensions are not
maximally portable. Note that support for multi-byte option
characters is only possible when such characters can be
represented as type int.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The optopt variable represents historical
practice and allows the application to obtain the identity
of the invalid option.</p>

<p>The description has been written to make it clear that
getopt(), like the getopts utility, deals with
option-arguments whether separated from the option by
&lt;blank&gt;s or not. Note that the requirements on
getopt() and getopts are more stringent than the Utility
Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The getopt() function shall return -1, rather than EOF,
so that &lt;stdio.h&gt; is not required.</p>

<p>The special significance of a colon as the first
character of optstring makes getopt() consistent with the
getopts utility. It allows an appli- cation to make a
distinction between a missing argument and an incor- rect
option letter without having to examine the option letter.
It is true that a missing argument can only be detected in
one case, but that is a case that has to be considered.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
