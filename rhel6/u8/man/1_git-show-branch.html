<p>GIT-SHOW-BRANCH(1) Git Manual GIT-SHOW-BRANCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-show-branch - Show branches and their
commits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git show-branch [-a|--all] [-r|--remotes]
[--topo-order | --date-order] [--current]
[--color[=&lt;when&gt;] | --no-color] [--sparse]
[--more=&lt;n&gt; | --list | --independent | --merge-base]
[--no-name | --sha1-name] [--topics] [&lt;rev&gt; |
&lt;glob&gt;]...</p>

<p>git show-branch (-g|--reflog)[=&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;base&gt;]]
[--list] [&lt;ref&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Shows the commit ancestry graph starting
from the commits named with &lt;rev&gt;s or &lt;globs&gt;s
(or all refs under refs/heads and/or refs/tags)
semi-visually.</p>

<p>It cannot show more than 29 branches and commits at a
time.</p>

<p>It uses showbranch.default multi-valued configuration
items if no &lt;rev&gt; nor &lt;glob&gt; is given on the
command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;rev&gt; Arbitrary extended SHA1 expression
(see git-rev-parse(1)) that typically names a branch head or
a tag.</p>

<p>&lt;glob&gt; A glob pattern that matches branch or tag
names under refs/. For example, if you have many topic
branches under refs/heads/topic, giving topic/* would show
all of them.</p>

<p>-r, --remotes Show the remote-tracking branches.</p>

<p>-a, --all Show both remote-tracking branches and local
branches.</p>

<p>--current With this option, the command includes the
current branch to the list of revs to be shown when it is
not given on the command line.</p>

<p>--topo-order By default, the branches and their commits
are shown in reverse chronological order. This option makes
them appear in topological order (i.e., descendant commits
are shown before their parents).</p>

<p>--date-order This option is similar to --topo-order in
the sense that no parent comes before all of its children,
but otherwise commits are ordered according to their commit
date.</p>

<p>--sparse By default, the output omits merges that are
reachable from only one tip being shown. This option makes
them visible.</p>

<p>--more=&lt;n&gt; Usually the command stops output upon
showing the commit that is the common ancestor of all the
branches. This flag tells the command to go &lt;n&gt; more
common commits beyond that. When &lt;n&gt; is negative,
display only the &lt;reference&gt;s given, without showing
the commit ancestry tree.</p>

<p>--list Synonym to --more=-1</p>

<p>--merge-base Instead of showing the commit list,
determine possible merge bases for the specified commits.
All merge bases will be contained in all specified commits.
This is different from how git-merge-base(1) handles the
case of three or more commits.</p>

<p>--independent Among the &lt;reference&gt;s given,
display only the ones that cannot be reached from any other
&lt;reference&gt;.</p>

<p>--no-name Do not show naming strings for each
commit.</p>

<p>--sha1-name Instead of naming the commits using the path
to reach them from heads (e.g. &quot;master~2&quot; to mean
the grandparent of &quot;master&quot;), name them with the
unique prefix of their object names.</p>

<p>--topics Shows only commits that are NOT on the first
branch given. This helps track topic branches by hiding any
commit that is already in the main line of development. When
given &quot;git show-branch --topics master topic1
topic2&quot;, this will show the revisions given by
&quot;git rev-list ^master topic1 topic2&quot;</p>

<p>-g, --reflog[=&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;base&gt;]] [&lt;ref&gt;]
Shows &lt;n&gt; most recent ref-log entries for the given
ref. If &lt;base&gt; is given, &lt;n&gt; entries going back
from that entry. &lt;base&gt; can be specified as count or
date. When no explicit &lt;ref&gt; parameter is given, it
defaults to the current branch (or HEAD if it is
detached).</p>

<p>--color[=&lt;when&gt;] Color the status sign (one of
these: * ! + -) of each commit corresponding to the branch
its in. The value must be always (the default), never, or
auto.</p>

<p>--no-color Turn off colored output, even when the
configuration file gives the default to color output. Same
as --color=never.</p>

<p>Note that --more, --list, --independent and --merge-base
options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>OUTPUT Given N &lt;references&gt;, the first N lines are
the one-line description from their commit message. The
branch head that is pointed at by $GIT_DIR/HEAD is prefixed
with an asterisk * character while other heads are prefixed
with a ! character.</p>

<p>Following these N lines, one-line log for each commit is
displayed, indented N places. If a commit is on the I-th
branch, the I-th indentation character shows a + sign;
otherwise it shows a space. Merge commits are denoted by a -
sign. Each commit shows a short name that can be used as an
extended SHA1 to name that commit.</p>

<p>The following example shows three branches,
&quot;master&quot;, &quot;fixes&quot; and
&quot;mhf&quot;:</p>

<p>$ git show-branch master fixes mhf * [master] Add
&acute;git show-branch&acute;. ! [fixes] Introduce
&quot;reset type&quot; flag to &quot;git reset&quot; ! [mhf]
Allow &quot;+remote:local&quot; refspec to cause --force
when fetching. --- + [mhf] Allow &quot;+remote:local&quot;
refspec to cause --force when fetching. + [mhf~1] Use
git-octopus when pulling more than one heads. + [fixes]
Introduce &quot;reset type&quot; flag to &quot;git
reset&quot; + [mhf~2] &quot;git fetch --force&quot;. +
[mhf~3] Use .git/remote/origin, not .git/branches/origin. +
[mhf~4] Make &quot;git pull&quot; and &quot;git fetch&quot;
default to origin + [mhf~5] Infamous &acute;octopus
merge&acute; + [mhf~6] Retire git-parse-remote. + [mhf~7]
Multi-head fetch. + [mhf~8] Start adding the
$GIT_DIR/remotes/ support. *++ [master] Add &acute;git
show-branch&acute;.</p>

<p>These three branches all forked from a common commit,
[master], whose commit message is &quot;Add &acute;git
show-branch&acute;&quot;. The &quot;fixes&quot; branch adds
one commit &quot;Introduce &quot;reset type&quot; flag to
&quot;git reset&quot;&quot;. The &quot;mhf&quot; branch adds
many other commits. The current branch is
&quot;master&quot;.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE If you keep your primary branches immediately
under refs/heads, and topic branches in subdirectories of
it, having the following in the configuration file may
help:</p>

<p>[showbranch] default = --topo-order default =
heads/*</p>

<p>With this, git show-branch without extra parameters
would show only the primary branches. In addition, if you
happen to be on your topic branch, it is shown as well.</p>

<p>$ git show-branch --reflog=&quot;10,1 hour ago&quot;
--list master</p>

<p>shows 10 reflog entries going back from the tip as of 1
hour ago. Without --list, the output also shows how these
tips are topologically related with each other.</p>
