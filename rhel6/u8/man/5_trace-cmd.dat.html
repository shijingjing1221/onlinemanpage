<p>TRACE-CMD.DAT(5) [FIXME: manual] TRACE-CMD.DAT(5)</p>

<p>NAME trace-cmd.dat - trace-cmd file format</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The trace-cmd(1) utility produces a
&quot;trace.dat&quot; file. The file may also be named
anything depending if the user specifies a different output
name, but it must have a certain binary format. The file is
used by trace-cmd to save kernel traces into it and be able
to extract the trace from it at a later point (see
trace-cmd-report(1)).</p>

<p>INITIAL FORMAT The first three bytes contain the magic
value:</p>

<p>0x17 0x08 0x44</p>

<p>The next 7 bytes contain the characters:</p>

<p>&quot;tracing&quot;</p>

<p>The next set of characters contain a null &acute;
&acute; terminated string that contains the version of the
file (for example):</p>

<p>&quot;6 &quot;</p>

<p>The next 1 byte contains the flags for the file
endianess:</p>

<p>0 = little endian 1 = big endian</p>

<p>The next byte contains the number of bytes per
&quot;long&quot; value:</p>

<p>4 - 32-bit long values 8 - 64-bit long values</p>

<p>Note: This is the long size of the target&acute;s
userspace. Not the kernel space size.</p>

<p>[ Now all numbers are written in file defined endianess.
]</p>

<p>The next 4 bytes are a 32-bit word that defines what the
traced host machine page size was.</p>

<p>HEADER INFO FORMAT Directly after the initial format
comes information about the trace headers recorded from the
target box.</p>

<p>The next 12 bytes contain the string:</p>

<p>&quot;header_page &quot;</p>

<p>The next 8 bytes are a 64-bit word containing the size
of the page header information stored next.</p>

<p>The next set of data is of the size read from the
previous 8 bytes, and contains the data retrieved from
debugfs/tracing/events/header_page.</p>

<p>Note: The size of the second field <b>commit</b>
contains the target kernel long size. For example:</p>

<p>field: local_t commit; offset:8; <b>size:8;</b>
signed:1;</p>

<p>shows the kernel has a 64-bit long.</p>

<p>The next 13 bytes contain the string:</p>

<p>&quot;header_event &quot;</p>

<p>The next 8 bytes are a 64-bit word containing the size
of the event header information stored next.</p>

<p>The next set of data is of the size read from the
previous 8 bytes and contains the data retrieved from
debugfs/tracing/events/header_event.</p>

<p>This data allows the trace-cmd tool to know if the ring
buffer format of the kernel made any changes.</p>

<p>FTRACE EVENT FORMATS Directly after the header
information comes the information about the Ftrace specific
events. These are the events used by the Ftrace plugins and
are not enabled by the event tracing.</p>

<p>The next 4 bytes contain a 32-bit word of the number of
Ftrace event format files that are stored in the file.</p>

<p>For the number of times defined by the previous 4 bytes
is the following:</p>

<p>8 bytes for the size of the Ftrace event format
file.</p>

<p>The Ftrace event format file copied from the target
machine:
debugfs/tracing/events/ftrace/&lt;event&gt;/format</p>

<p>EVENT FORMATS Directly after the Ftrace formats comes
the information about the event layout.</p>

<p>The next 4 bytes are a 32-bit word containing the number
of event systems that are stored in the file. These are the
directories in debugfs/tracing/events excluding the
<b>ftrace</b> directory.</p>

<p>For the number of times defined by the previous 4 bytes
is the following:</p>

<p>A null-terminated string containing the system name.</p>

<p>4 bytes containing a 32-bit word containing the number
of events within the system.</p>

<p>For the number of times defined in the previous 4 bytes
is the following:</p>

<p>8 bytes for the size of the event format file.</p>

<p>The event format file copied from the target machine:
debugfs/tracing/events/&lt;system&gt;/&lt;event&gt;/format</p>

<p>KALLSYMS INFORMATION Directly after the event formats
comes the information of the mapping of function addresses
to the function names.</p>

<p>The next 4 bytes are a 32-bit word containing the size
of the data holding the function mappings.</p>

<p>The next set of data is of the size defined by the
previous 4 bytes and contains the information from the
target machine&acute;s file: /proc/kallsyms</p>

<p>TRACE_PRINTK INFORMATION If a developer used
trace_printk() within the kernel, it may store the format
string outside the ring buffer. This information can be
found in: debugfs/tracing/printk_formats</p>

<p>The next 4 bytes are a 32-bit word containing the size
of the data holding the printk formats.</p>

<p>The next set of data is of the size defined by the
previous 4 bytes and contains the information from
debugfs/tracing/printk_formats.</p>

<p>PROCESS INFORMATION Directly after the trace_printk
formats comes the information mapping a PID to a process
name.</p>

<p>The next 8 bytes contain a 64-bit word that holds the
size of the data mapping the PID to a process name.</p>

<p>The next set of data is of the size defined by the
previous 8 bytes and contains the information from
debugfs/tracing/saved_cmdlines.</p>

<p>REST OF TRACE-CMD HEADER Directly after the process
information comes the last bit of the trace.dat file
header.</p>

<p>The next 4 bytes are a 32-bit word defining the number
of CPUs that were discovered on the target machine (and has
matching trace data for it).</p>

<p>The next 10 bytes are one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;options &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;latency &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;flyrecord &quot;</p>

<p>If it is &quot;options &quot; then:</p>

<p>The next 2 bytes are a 16-bit word defining the current
option. If the the value is zero then there are no more
options.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the next 4 bytes contain a 32-bit word
containing the option size. If the reader does not know how
to handle the option it can simply skip it. Currently there
are no options defined, but this is here to extend the
data.</p>

<p>The next option will be directly after the previous
option, and the options ends with a zero in the option type
field.</p>

<p>The next 10 bytes after the options are one of the
following:</p>

<p>&quot;latency &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;flyrecord &quot;</p>

<p>which would follow the same as if options were not
present.</p>

<p>If the value is &quot;latency &quot;, then the rest of
the file is simply ASCII text that was taken from the
target&acute;s: debugfs/tracing/trace</p>

<p>If the value is &quot;flyrecord &quot;, the following is
present:</p>

<p>For the number of CPUs that were read earlier, the
following is present:</p>

<p>8 bytes that are a 64-bit word containing the offset
into the file that holds the data for the CPU.</p>

<p>8 bytes that are a 64-bit word containing the size of
the CPU data at that offset.</p>

<p>CPU DATA The CPU data is located in the part of the file
that is specified in the end of the header. Padding is
placed between the header and the CPU data, placing the CPU
data at a page aligned (target page) position in the
file.</p>

<p>This data is copied directly from the Ftrace ring buffer
and is of the same format as the ring buffer specified by
the event header files loaded in the header format file.</p>

<p>The trace-cmd tool will try to <b>mmap(2)</b> the data
page by page with the target&acute;s page size if possible.
If it fails to mmap, it will just read the data instead.</p>
