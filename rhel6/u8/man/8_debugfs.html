<p>DEBUGFS(8) DEBUGFS(8)</p>

<p>NAME debugfs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system debugger</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS debugfs [ -Vwci ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -s
superblock ] [ -f cmd_file ] [ -R request ] [ -d
data_source_device ] [ device ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The debugfs program is an interactive file
system debugger. It can be used to examine and change the
state of an ext2, ext3, or ext4 file system. device is the
special file corresponding to the device containing the file
system (e.g /dev/hdXX).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -w Specifies that the file system should be
opened in read-write mode. Without this option, the file
system is opened in read- only mode.</p>

<p>-c Specifies that the file system should be opened in
catastrophic mode, in which the inode and group bitmaps are
not read ini- tially. This can be useful for filesystems
with significant corruption, but because of this,
catastrophic mode forces the filesystem to be opened
read-only.</p>

<p>-i Specifies that device represents an ext2 image file
created by the e2image program. Since the ext2 image file
only contains the superblock, block group descriptor, block
and inode alloca- tion bitmaps, and the inode table, many
debugfs commands will not function properly. Warning: no
safety checks are in place, and debugfs may fail in
interesting ways if commands such as ls, dump, etc. are
tried without specifying the data_source_device using the -d
option. debugfs is a debugging tool. It has rough edges!</p>

<p>-d data_source_device Used with the -i option, specifies
that data_source_device should be used when reading blocks
not found in the ext2 image file. This includes data,
directory, and indirect blocks.</p>

<p>-b blocksize Forces the use of the given block size for
the file system, rather than detecting the correct block
size as normal.</p>

<p>-s superblock Causes the file system superblock to be
read from the given block number, instead of using the
primary superblock (located at an offset of 1024 bytes from
the beginning of the filesys- tem). If you specify the -s
option, you must also provide the blocksize of the
filesystem via the -b option.</p>

<p>-f cmd_file Causes debugfs to read in commands from
cmd_file, and execute them. When debugfs is finished
executing those commands, it will exit.</p>

<p>-R request Causes debugfs to execute the single command
request, and then exit.</p>

<p>-V print the version number of debugfs and exit.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING FILES Many debugfs commands take a filespec
as an argument to specify an inode (as opposed to a
pathname) in the filesystem which is currently opened by
debugfs. The filespec argument may be specified in two
forms. The first form is an inode number surrounded by angle
brackets, e.g., &lt;2&gt;. The second form is a pathname; if
the pathname is prefixed by a forward slash (/), then it is
interpreted relative to the root of the filesystem which is
currently opened by debugfs. If not, the pathname is
interpreted relative to the current working directory as
maintained by debugfs. This may be modified by using the
debugfs com- mand cd.</p>

<p>COMMANDS This is a list of the commands which debugfs
supports.</p>

<p>bmap filespec logical_block Print the physical block
number corresponding to the logical block number
logical_block in the inode filespec.</p>

<p>cat filespec Dump the contents of the inode filespec to
stdout.</p>

<p>cd filespec Change the current working directory to
filespec.</p>

<p>chroot filespec Change the root directory to be the
directory filespec.</p>

<p>close [-a] Close the currently open file system. If the
-a option is spec- ified, write out any changes to the
superblock and block group descriptors to all of the backup
superblocks, not just to the master superblock.</p>

<p>clri file Clear the contents of the inode file.</p>

<p>dump [-p] filespec out_file Dump the contents of the
inode filespec to the output file out_file. If the -p option
is given set the owner, group and permissions information on
out_file to match filespec.</p>

<p>dump_extents [-n] [-l] filespec Dump the the extent tree
of the inode filespec. The -n flag will cause dump_extents
to only display the interior nodes in the extent tree. The
-l flag cause dump_extents to only dis- play the leaf nodes
in the extent tree.</p>

<p>(Please note that the length and range of blocks for the
last extent in an interior node is an estimate by the
extents library functions, and is not stored in filesystem
data structures. Hence, the values displayed may not
necessarily by accurate and does not indicate a problem or
corruption in the file system.)</p>

<p>expand_dir filespec Expand the directory filespec.</p>

<p>feature [fs_feature] [-fs_feature] ... Set or clear
various filesystem features in the superblock. After setting
or clearing any filesystem features that were requested,
print the current state of the filesystem feature set.</p>

<p>find_free_block [count [goal]] Find the first count free
blocks, starting from goal and allo- cate it.</p>

<p>find_free_inode [dir [mode]] Find a free inode and
allocate it. If present, dir specifies the inode number of
the directory which the inode is to be located. The second
optional argument mode specifies the per- missions of the
new inode. (If the directory bit is set on the mode, the
allocation routine will function differently.)</p>

<p>freeb block [count] Mark the block number block as not
allocated. If the optional argument count is present, then
count blocks starting at block number block will be marked
as not allocated.</p>

<p>freei filespec Free the inode specified by filespec.</p>

<p>help Print a list of commands understood by
debugfs(8).</p>

<p>icheck block ... Print a listing of the inodes which use
the one or more blocks specified on the command line.</p>

<p>imap filespec Print the location of the inode data
structure (in the inode ta- ble) of the inode filespec.</p>

<p>init_filesys device blocksize Create an ext2 file system
on device with device size blocksize. Note that this does
not fully initialize all of the data struc- tures; to do
this, use the mke2fs(8) program. This is just a call to the
low-level library, which sets up the superblock and block
descriptors.</p>

<p>kill_file filespec Deallocate the inode filespec and its
blocks. Note that this does not remove any directory entries
(if any) to this inode. See the rm(1) command if you wish to
unlink a file.</p>

<p>lcd directory Change the current working directory of
the debugfs process to directory on the native
filesystem.</p>

<p>ln filespec dest_file Create a link named dest_file
which is a link to filespec. Note this does not adjust the
inode reference counts.</p>

<p>logdump [-acs] [-b&lt;block&gt;] [-i&lt;filespec&gt;]
[-f&lt;journal_file&gt;] [out- put_file] Dump the contents
of the ext3 journal. By default, the journal inode as
specified in the superblock. However, this can be overridden
with the -i option, which uses an inode specifier to specify
the journal to be used. A file containing journal data can
be specified using the -f option. Finally, the -s option
utilizes the backup information in the superblock to locate
the journal.</p>

<p>The -a option causes the logdump program to print the
contents of all of the descriptor blocks. The -b option
causes logdump to print all journal records that are refer
to the specified block. The -c option will print out the
contents of all of the data blocks selected by the -a and -b
options.</p>

<p>ls [-l] [-d] [-p] filespec Print a listing of the files
in the directory filespec. The -l flag will list files using
a more verbose format. The -d flag will list deleted entries
in the directory. The -p flag will list the files in a
format which is more easily parsable by scripts, as well as
making it more clear when there are spaces or other
non-printing characters at the end of filenames.</p>

<p>modify_inode filespec Modify the contents of the inode
structure in the inode file- spec.</p>

<p>mkdir filespec Make a directory.</p>

<p>mknod filespec [p|[[c|b] major minor]] Create a special
device file (a named pipe, character or block device). If a
character or block device is to be made, the major and minor
device numbers must be specified.</p>

<p>ncheck inode_num ... Take the requested list of inode
numbers, and print a listing of pathnames to those
inodes.</p>

<p>open [-w] [-e] [-f] [-i] [-c] [-b blocksize] [-s
superblock] device Open a filesystem for editing. The -f
flag forces the filesys- tem to be opened even if there are
some unknown or incompatible filesystem features which would
normally prevent the filesystem from being opened. The -e
flag causes the filesystem to be opened in exclusive mode.
The -b, -c, -i, -s, and -w options behave the same as the
command-line options to debugfs.</p>

<p>pwd Print the current working directory.</p>

<p>quit Quit debugfs</p>

<p>rdump directory destination Recursively dump directory
and all its contents (including regu- lar files, symbolic
links, and other directories) into the named destination
which should be an existing directory on the native
filesystem.</p>

<p>rm pathname Unlink pathname. If this causes the inode
pointed to by path- name to have no other references,
deallocate the file. This command functions as the unlink()
system call.</p>

<p>rmdir filespec Remove the directory filespec.</p>

<p>setb block [count] Mark the block number block as
allocated. If the optional argu- ment count is present, then
count blocks starting at block num- ber block will be marked
as allocated.</p>

<p>set_block_group bgnum field value Modify the block group
descriptor specified by bgnum so that the block group
descriptor field field has value value.</p>

<p>seti filespec Mark inode filespec as in use in the inode
bitmap.</p>

<p>set_inode_field filespec field value Modify the inode
specified by filespec so that the inode field field has
value value. The list of valid inode fields which can be set
via this command can be displayed by using the command:
set_inode_field -l</p>

<p>set_super_value field value Set the superblock field
field to value. The list of valid superblock fields which
can be set via this command can be displayed by using the
command: set_super_value -l</p>

<p>show_super_stats [-h] List the contents of the super
block and the block group descriptors. If the -h flag is
given, only print out the superblock contents.</p>

<p>stat filespec Display the contents of the inode
structure of the inode file- spec.</p>

<p>testb block [count] Test if the block number block is
marked as allocated in the block bitmap. If the optional
argument count is present, then count blocks starting at
block number block will be tested.</p>

<p>testi filespec Test if the inode filespec is marked as
allocated in the inode bitmap.</p>

<p>undel &lt;inode num&gt; [pathname] Undelete the
specified inode number (which must be surrounded by angle
brackets) so that it and its blocks are marked in use, and
optionally link the recovered inode to the specified
pathname. The e2fsck command should always be run after
using the undel command to recover deleted files.</p>

<p>Note that if you are recovering a large number of
deleted files, linking the inode to a directory may require
the directory to be expanded, which could allocate a block
that had been used by one of the yet-to-be-undeleted files.
So it is safer to undelete all of the inodes without
specifying a destination pathname, and then in a separate
pass, use the debugfs link command to link the inode to the
destination pathname, or use e2fsck to check the filesystem
and link all of the recovered inodes to the lost+found
directory.</p>

<p>unlink pathname Remove the link specified by pathname to
an inode. Note this does not adjust the inode reference
counts.</p>

<p>write source_file out_file Create a file in the
filesystem named out_file, and copy the contents of
source_file into the destination file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DEBUGFS_PAGER, PAGER The
debugfs(8) program always pipes the output of the some com-
mands through a pager program. These commands include:
show_super_stats, list_directory, show_inode_info,
list_deleted_inodes, and htree_dump. The specific pager can
explicitly specified by the DEBUGFS_PAGER environment
variable, and if it is not set, by the PAGER environment
variable.</p>

<p>Note that since a pager is always used, the less(1)
pager is not particularly appropriate, since it clears the
screen before dis- playing the output of the command and
clears the output the screen when the pager is exited. Many
users prefer to use the less(1) pager for most purposes,
which is why the DEBUGFS_PAGER environment variable is
available to override the more general PAGER environment
variable.</p>
