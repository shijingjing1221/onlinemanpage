<p>NAME tcpd - access control facility for internet
services</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tcpd program can be set up to monitor
incoming requests for telnet, finger, ftp, exec, rsh,
rlogin, tftp, talk, comsat and other services that have a
one-to-one mapping onto executable files.</p>

<p>The program supports both 4.3BSD-style sockets and
System V.4-style TLI. Functionality may be limited when the
protocol underneath TLI is not an internet protocol.</p>

<p>Operation is as follows: whenever a request for service
arrives, the inetd daemon is tricked into running the tcpd
program instead of the desired server. tcpd logs the request
and does some additional checks. When all is well, tcpd runs
the appropriate server program and goes away.</p>

<p>Optional features are: pattern-based access control,
client username lookups with the RFC 931 etc. protocol,
protection against hosts that pretend to have someone elses
host name, and protection against hosts that pretend to have
someone elses network address.</p>

<p>LOGGING Connections that are monitored by tcpd are
reported through the sys- log(3) facility. Each record
contains a time stamp, the client host name and the name of
the requested service. The information can be useful to
detect unwanted activities, especially when logfile informa-
tion from several hosts is merged.</p>

<p>In order to find out where your logs are going, examine
the syslog con- figuration file, usually
/etc/syslog.conf.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL Optionally, tcpd supports a simple form
of access control that is based on pattern matching. The
access-control software provides hooks for the execution of
shell commands when a pattern fires. For details, see the
hosts_access(5) manual page.</p>

<p>HOST NAME VERIFICATION The authentication scheme of some
protocols (rlogin, rsh) relies on host names. Some
implementations believe the host name that they get from any
random name server; other implementations are more careful
but use a flawed algorithm.</p>

<p>tcpd verifies the client host name that is returned by
the address-&gt;name DNS server by looking at the host name
and address that are returned by the name-&gt;address DNS
server. If any discrepancy is detected, tcpd concludes that
it is dealing with a host that pretends to have someone
elses host name.</p>

<p>If the sources are compiled with -DPARANOID, tcpd will
drop the connec- tion in case of a host name/address
mismatch. Otherwise, the hostname can be matched with the
PARANOID wildcard, after which suitable action can be
taken.</p>

<p>HOST ADDRESS SPOOFING Optionally, tcpd disables
source-routing socket options on every con- nection that it
deals with. This will take care of most attacks from hosts
that pretend to have an address that belongs to someone
elses network. UDP services do not benefit from this
protection. This feature must be turned on at compile
time.</p>

<p>RFC 931 When RFC 931 etc. lookups are enabled
(compile-time option) tcpd will attempt to establish the
name of the client user. This will succeed only if the
client host runs an RFC 931-compliant daemon. Client user
name lookups will not work for datagram-oriented
connections, and may cause noticeable delays in the case of
connections from PCs.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The details of using tcpd depend on pathname
information that was com- piled into the program.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 1 This example applies when tcpd expects that
the original network dae- mons will be moved to an
&quot;other&quot; place.</p>

<p>In order to monitor access to the finger service, move
the original finger daemon to the &quot;other&quot; place
and install tcpd in the place of the original finger daemon.
No changes are required to configuration files.</p>

<p># mkdir /other/place # mv /usr/etc/in.fingerd
/other/place # cp tcpd /usr/etc/in.fingerd</p>

<p>The example assumes that the network daemons live in
/usr/etc. On some systems, network daemons live in /usr/sbin
or in /usr/libexec, or have no in.&acute; prefix to their
name.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 2 This example applies when tcpd expects that
the network daemons are left in their original place.</p>

<p>In order to monitor access to the finger service,
perform the following edits on the inetd configuration file
(usually /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/inet/inetd.conf):</p>

<p>finger stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/etc/in.fingerd
in.fingerd</p>

<p>becomes:</p>

<p>finger stream tcp nowait nobody /some/where/tcpd
in.fingerd</p>

<p>The example assumes that the network daemons live in
/usr/etc. On some systems, network daemons live in /usr/sbin
or in /usr/libexec, the dae- mons have no in.&acute; prefix
to their name, or there is no userid field in the inetd
configuration file.</p>

<p>Similar changes will be needed for the other services
that are to be covered by tcpd. Send a kill -HUP&acute; to
the inetd(8) process to make the changes effective. AIX
users may also have to execute the inetimp&acute;
command.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 3 In the case of daemons that do not live in a
common directory (&quot;secret&quot; or otherwise), edit the
inetd configuration file so that it specifies an absolute
path name for the process name field. For example:</p>

<p>ntalk dgram udp wait root /some/where/tcpd
/usr/local/lib/ntalkd</p>

<p>Only the last component (ntalkd) of the pathname will be
used for access control and logging.</p>

<p>BUGS Some UDP (and RPC) daemons linger around for a
while after they have finished their work, in case another
request comes in. In the inetd configuration file these
services are registered with the wait option. Only the
request that started such a daemon will be logged.</p>

<p>The program does not work with RPC services over TCP.
These services are registered as rpc/tcp in the inetd
configuration file. The only non-trivial service that is
affected by this limitation is rexd, which is used by the
on(1) command. This is no great loss. On most systems, rexd
is less secure than a wildcard in /etc/hosts.equiv.</p>

<p>RPC broadcast requests (for example: rwall, rup, rusers)
always appear to come from the responding host. What happens
is that the client broadcasts the request to all portmap
daemons on its network; each portmap daemon forwards the
request to a local daemon. As far as the rwall etc. daemons
know, the request comes from the local host.</p>

<p>FILES The default locations of the host access control
tables are:</p>

<p>/etc/hosts.allow /etc/hosts.deny</p>

control tables. syslog.conf(5), format of the syslogd
control file. inetd.conf(5), format of the inetd control
file.</p>
