<p>NAME nfsidmap - The NFS idmapper upcall program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nfsidmap [-v] [-t timeout] key desc nfsidmap
[-v] [-c] nfsidmap [-v] [-u|-g|-r user] nfsidmap -d</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The NFSv4 protocol represents the local
systems UID and GID values on the wire as strings of the
form user@domain. The process of translat- ing from UID to
string and string to UID is referred to as &quot;ID map-
ping.&quot;</p>

<p>The system derives the user part of the string by
performing a password or group lookup. The lookup mechanism
is configured in /etc/idmapd.conf.</p>

<p>By default, the domain part of the string is the systems
DNS domain name. It can also be specified in
/etc/idmapd.conf if the system is multi-homed, or if the
systems DNS domain name does not match the name of the
systems Kerberos realm.</p>

<p>The /usr/sbin/nfsidmap program performs translations on
behalf of the kernel. The kernel uses the request-key
mechanism to perform an upcall. /usr/sbin/nfsidmap is
invoked by /sbin/request-key, performs the translation, and
initializes a key with the resulting information. The kernel
then caches the translation results in the key.</p>

<p>nfsidmap can also clear cached ID map results in the
kernel, or revoke one particular key. An incorrect cached
key can result in file and directory ownership reverting to
&quot;nobody&quot; on NFSv4 mount points.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Clear the keyring of all the keys.</p>

<p>-d Display the systems effective NFSv4 domain name on
stdout.</p>

<p>-g user Revoke the gid key of the given user.</p>

<p>-r user Revoke both the uid and gid key of the given
user.</p>

<p>-t timeout Set the expiration timer, in seconds, on the
key. The default is 600 seconds (10 mins).</p>

<p>-u user Revoke the uid key of the given user.</p>

<p>-v Increases the verbosity of the output to syslog (can
be speci- fied multiple times).</p>

<p>CONFIGURING The file /etc/request-key.conf will need to
be modified so /sbin/request-key can properly direct the
upcall. The following line should be added before a call to
keyctl negate:</p>

<p>create id_resolver * * /usr/sbin/nfsidmap -t 600 %k
%d</p>

<p>This will direct all id_resolver requests to the program
/usr/sbin/nfsidmap. The -t 600 defines how many seconds into
the future the key will expire. This is an optional
parameter for /usr/sbin/nfsidmap and will default to 600
seconds when not specified.</p>

<p>The idmapper system uses four key descriptions:</p>

<p>uid: Find the UID for the given user gid: Find the GID
for the given group user: Find the user name for the given
UID group: Find the group name for the given GID</p>

<p>You can choose to handle any of these individually,
rather than using the generic upcall program. If you would
like to use your own program for a uid lookup then you would
edit your request-key.conf so it looks similar to this:</p>

<p>create id_resolver uid:* * /some/other/program %k %d
create id_resolver * * /usr/sbin/nfsidmap %k %d</p>

<p>Notice that the new line was added above the line for
the generic pro- gram. request-key will find the first
matching line and run the corre- sponding program. In this
case, /some/other/program will handle all uid lookups, and
/usr/sbin/nfsidmap will handle gid, user, and group
lookups.</p>
