<p>NAME i2cset - set I2C registers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS i2cset [-f] [-y] [-m mask] [-r] i2cbus
chip-address data-address [value] ... [mode] i2cset -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION i2cset is a small helper program to set
registers visible through the I2C bus.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p>-f Force access to the device even if it is already
busy. By default, i2cset will refuse to access a device
which is already under the control of a kernel driver. Using
this flag is danger- ous, it can seriously confuse the
kernel driver in question. It can also cause i2cset to
silently write to the wrong register. So use at your own
risk and only if you know what youre doing.</p>

<p>-y Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cset will
wait for a confirmation from the user before messing with
the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the
operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p>-m mask The mask parameter, if specified, describes
which bits of value will be actually written to
data-address. Bits set to 1 in the mask are taken from
value, while bits set to 0 will be read from data-address
and thus preserved by the operation. Please note that this
parameter assumes that the read and write operations for the
specified mode are symmetrical for the device you are
accessing. This may or may not be the case, as neither I2C
nor SMBus guarantees this.</p>

<p>-r Read back the value right after writing it, and
compare the result with the value written. This used to be
the default behavior. The same limitations apply as those of
option -m.</p>

<p>There are three required options to i2cset. i2cbus
indicates the number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned.
This number should correspond to one of the busses listed by
i2cdetect -l. chip-address specifies the address of the chip
on that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and 0x77.
data-address specifies the address on that chip to write to,
and is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF.</p>

<p>The value parameter, if specified, is the value to write
to that loca- tion on the chip. If this parameter is
omitted, then a short write is issued. For most chips, it
simply sets an internal pointer to the tar- get location,
but doesn t actually write to that location. For a few chips
though, in particular simple ones with a single register,
this short write is an actual write. If the mode parameter
is s or i, multi- ple values can be specified.</p>

<p>The mode parameter, if specified, is one of the letters
b, w, s, or i, corresponding to a write size of a single
byte, a 16-bit word, a SMBus block write, or an I2C block
write, respectively. For SMBus and I2C block writes, the
write size is determined by the number of value parameters.
Except for I2C block writes, a p can also be appended to the
mode parameter to enable PEC. If the mode parameter is
omitted, i2cset defaults to byte mode without PEC. The value
provided must be within range for the specified data type
(0x00-0xFF for byte and block writes, 0x0000-0xFFFF for
words). Another possible mode is c, which doesn t write any
value (so-called short write). You usually dont have to
specify this mode, as it is the default when no value is
provided, unless you also want to enable PEC.</p>

<p>WARNING i2cset can be extremely dangerous if used
improperly. It can confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss, or
have more serious side effects. Writ- ing to a serial EEPROM
on a memory DIMM (chip addresses between 0x50 and 0x57) may
DESTROY your memory, leaving your system unbootable! Be
extremely careful using this program.</p>
