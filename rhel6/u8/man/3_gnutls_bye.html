<p>gnutls_bye(3) gnutls gnutls_bye(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_bye - terminate the current TLS/SSL
connection.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_bye(gnutls_session_t session,
gnutls_close_request_t how);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>gnutls_close_request_t how is an integer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Terminates the current TLS/SSL connection.
The connection should have been initiated using
gnutls_handshake(). how should be one of GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR,
GNUTLS_SHUT_WR.</p>

<p>In case of GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR then the TLS connection gets
terminated and further receives and sends will be
disallowed. If the return value is zero you may continue
using the connection. GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR actually sends an
alert containing a close request and waits for the peer to
reply with the same message.</p>

<p>In case of GNUTLS_SHUT_WR then the TLS connection gets
terminated and further sends will be disallowed. In order to
reuse the connection you should wait for an EOF from the
peer. GNUTLS_SHUT_WR sends an alert containing a close
request.</p>

<p>Note that not all implementations will properly
terminate a TLS connec- tion. Some of them, usually for
performance reasons, will terminate only the underlying
transport layer, thus causing a transmission error to the
peer. This error cannot be distinguished from a malicious
party prematurely terminating the session, thus this
behavior is not recom- mended.</p>

<p>This function may also return GNUTLS_E_AGAIN or
GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED; cf. gnutls_record_get_direction().</p>

<p>RETURNS GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error code,
see function documenta- tion for entire semantics.</p>
