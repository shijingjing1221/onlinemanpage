<p>USB_SG_INIT(9) USB Core APIs USB_SG_INIT(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_sg_init - initializes scatterlist-based
bulk/interrupt I/O request</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_sg_init(struct usb_sg_request * io,
struct usb_device * dev, unsigned pipe, unsigned period,
struct scatterlist * sg, int nents, size_t length, gfp_t
mem_flags);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS io request block being initialized. until
usb_sg_wait returns, treat this as a pointer to an opaque
block of memory,</p>

<p>dev the usb device that will send or receive the
data</p>

<p>pipe endpoint pipe used to transfer the data</p>

<p>period polling rate for interrupt endpoints, in frames
or (for high speed endpoints) microframes; ignored for
bulk</p>

<p>sg scatterlist entries</p>

<p>nents how many entries in the scatterlist</p>

<p>length how many bytes to send from the scatterlist, or
zero to send every byte identified in the list.</p>

<p>mem_flags SLAB_* flags affecting memory allocations in
this call</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Returns zero for success, else a negative
errno value. This initializes a scatter/gather request,
allocating resources such as I/O mappings and urb memory
(except maybe memory used by USB controller drivers).</p>

<p>The request must be issued using usb_sg_wait, which
waits for the I/O to complete (or to be canceled) and then
cleans up all resources allocated by usb_sg_init.</p>

<p>The request may be canceled with usb_sg_cancel, either
before or after usb_sg_wait is called.</p>
