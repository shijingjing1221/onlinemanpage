<p>PERLDEBGUTS(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLDEBGUTS(1)</p>

<p>NAME perldebguts - Guts of Perl debugging</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is not the perldebug(1) manpage, which
tells you how to use the debugger. This manpage describes
low-level details concerning the debugger s internals, which
range from difficult to impossible to understand for anyone
who isnt incredibly intimate with Perls guts. Caveat
lector.</p>

<p>Debugger Internals Perl has special debugging hooks at
compile-time and run-time used to create debugging
environments. These hooks are not to be confused with the
perl -Dxxx command described in perlrun, which is usable
only if a special Perl is built per the instructions in the
INSTALL podpage in the Perl source tree.</p>

<p>For example, whenever you call Perl s built-in
&quot;caller&quot; function from the package &quot;DB&quot;,
the arguments that the corresponding stack frame was called
with are copied to the @DB::args array. These mechanisms are
enabled by calling Perl with the -d switch. Specifically,
the following additional features are enabled (cf.
&quot;$^P&quot; in perlvar):</p>

<p>&middot; Perl inserts the contents of $ENV{PERL5DB} (or
&quot;BEGIN {require &rsquo;perl5db.pl&rsquo;}&quot; if not
present) before the first line of your program.</p>

<p>&middot; Each array
&quot;@{&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;}&quot; holds the lines of
$filename for a file compiled by Perl. The same is also true
for &quot;eval&quot;ed strings that contain subroutines, or
which are currently being executed. The $filename for
&quot;eval&quot;ed strings looks like &quot;(eval 34)&quot;.
Code assertions in regexes look like &quot;(re_eval
19)&quot;.</p>

<p>Values in this array are magical in numeric context:
they compare equal to zero only if the line is not
breakable.</p>

<p>&middot; Each hash
&quot;%{&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;}&quot; contains
breakpoints and actions keyed by line number. Individual
entries (as opposed to the whole hash) are settable. Perl
only cares about Boolean true here, although the values used
by perl5db.pl have the form &quot;$break_condition
$action&quot;.</p>

<p>The same holds for evaluated strings that contain
subroutines, or which are currently being executed. The
$filename for &quot;eval&quot;ed strings looks like
&quot;(eval 34)&quot; or &quot;(re_eval 19)&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Each scalar
&quot;${&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;}&quot; contains
&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;. This is also the case for
evaluated strings that contain subroutines, or which are
currently being executed. The $filename for
&quot;eval&quot;ed strings looks like &quot;(eval 34)&quot;
or &quot;(re_eval 19)&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; After each &quot;require&quot;d file is
compiled, but before it is executed,
&quot;DB::postponed(*{&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;})&quot; is
called if the subroutine &quot;DB::postponed&quot; exists.
Here, the $filename is the expanded name of the
&quot;require&quot;d file, as found in the values of
%INC.</p>

<p>&middot; After each subroutine &quot;subname&quot; is
compiled, the existence of $DB::postponed{subname} is
checked. If this key exists,
&quot;DB::postponed(subname)&quot; is called if the
&quot;DB::postponed&quot; subroutine also exists.</p>

<p>&middot; A hash %DB::sub is maintained, whose keys are
subroutine names and whose values have the form
&quot;filename:startline-endline&quot;. &quot;filename&quot;
has the form &quot;(eval 34)&quot; for subroutines defined
inside &quot;eval&quot;s, or &quot;(re_eval 19)&quot; for
those within regex code assertions.</p>

<p>&middot; When the execution of your program reaches a
point that can hold a breakpoint, the &quot;DB::DB()&quot;
subroutine is called if any of the variables $DB::trace,
$DB::single, or $DB::signal is true. These variables are not
&quot;local&quot;izable. This feature is disabled when
executing inside &quot;DB::DB()&quot;, including functions
called from it unless &quot;$^D &amp; (1&lt;&lt;30)&quot; is
true.</p>

<p>&middot; When execution of the program reaches a
subroutine call, a call to &amp;DB::sub(args) is made
instead, with $DB::sub holding the name of the called
subroutine. (This doesn t happen if the subroutine was
compiled in the &quot;DB&quot; package.)</p>

<p>Note that if &amp;DB::sub needs external data for it to
work, no subroutine call is possible without it. As an
example, the standard debuggers &amp;DB::sub depends on the
$DB::deep variable (it defines how many levels of recursion
deep into the debugger you can go before a mandatory break).
If $DB::deep is not defined, subroutine calls are not
possible, even though &amp;DB::sub exists.</p>

<p>Writing Your Own Debugger Environment Variables</p>

<p>The &quot;PERL5DB&quot; environment variable can be used
to define a debugger. For example, the minimal
&quot;working&quot; debugger (it actually doesnt do
anything) consists of one line:</p>

<p>sub DB::DB {}</p>

<p>It can easily be defined like this:</p>

<p>$ PERL5DB=&quot;sub DB::DB {}&quot; perl -d
your-script</p>

<p>Another brief debugger, slightly more useful, can be
created with only the line:</p>

<p>sub DB::DB {print ++$i; scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;}</p>

<p>This debugger prints a number which increments for each
statement encountered and waits for you to hit a newline
before continuing to the next statement.</p>

<p>The following debugger is actually useful:</p>

<p>{ package DB; sub DB {} sub sub {print ++$i, &quot;
$sub0; &amp;$sub} }</p>

<p>It prints the sequence number of each subroutine call
and the name of the called subroutine. Note that
&amp;DB::sub is being compiled into the package
&quot;DB&quot; through the use of the &quot;package&quot;
directive.</p>

<p>When it starts, the debugger reads your rc file
(./.perldb or ~/.perldb under Unix), which can set important
options. (A subroutine (&amp;afterinit) can be defined here
as well; it is executed after the debugger completes its own
initialization.)</p>

<p>After the rc file is read, the debugger reads the
PERLDB_OPTS environment variable and uses it to set debugger
options. The contents of this variable are treated as if
they were the argument of an &quot;o ...&quot; debugger
command (q.v. in &quot;Options&quot; in perldebug).</p>

<p>Debugger internal variables</p>

<p>In addition to the file and subroutine-related variables
mentioned above, the debugger also maintains various magical
internal variables.</p>

<p>&middot; @DB::dbline is an alias for
&quot;@{&quot;::_&lt;current_file&quot;}&quot;, which holds
the lines of the currently-selected file (compiled by Perl),
either explicitly chosen with the debuggers &quot;f&quot;
command, or implicitly by flow of execution.</p>

<p>Values in this array are magical in numeric context:
they compare equal to zero only if the line is not
breakable.</p>

<p>&middot; %DB::dbline, is an alias for
&quot;%{&quot;::_&lt;current_file&quot;}&quot;, which
contains breakpoints and actions keyed by line number in the
currently-selected file, either explicitly chosen with the
debuggers &quot;f&quot; command, or implicitly by flow of
execution.</p>

<p>As previously noted, individual entries (as opposed to
the whole hash) are settable. Perl only cares about Boolean
true here, although the values used by perl5db.pl have the
form &quot;$break_condition $action&quot;.</p>

<p>Debugger customization functions</p>

<p>Some functions are provided to simplify
customization.</p>

<p>&middot; See &quot;Configurable Options&quot; in
perldebug for a description of options parsed by
&quot;DB::parse_options(string)&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;DB::dump_trace(skip[,count])&quot; skips
the specified number of frames and returns a list containing
information about the calling frames (all of them, if
&quot;count&quot; is missing). Each entry is reference to a
hash with keys &quot;context&quot; (either &quot;.&quot;,
&quot;$&quot;, or &quot;@&quot;), &quot;sub&quot;
(subroutine name, or info about &quot;eval&quot;),
&quot;args&quot; (&quot;undef&quot; or a reference to an
array), &quot;file&quot;, and &quot;line&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;DB::print_trace(FH, skip[, count[,
short]])&quot; prints formatted info about caller frames.
The last two functions may be convenient as arguments to
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; commands.</p>

<p>Note that any variables and functions that are not
documented in this manpages (or in perldebug) are considered
for internal use only, and as such are subject to change
without notice.</p>

<p>Frame Listing Output Examples The &quot;frame&quot;
option can be used to control the output of frame
information. For example, contrast this expression
trace:</p>

<p>$ perl -de 42 Stack dump during die enabled outside of
evals.</p>

<p>Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl patch level 0.94
Emacs support available.</p>

<p>Enter h or &lsquo;h h&rsquo; for help.</p>

<p>main::(-e:1): 0 DB&lt;1&gt; sub foo { 14 }</p>

<p>DB&lt;2&gt; sub bar { 3 }</p>

<p>DB&lt;3&gt; t print foo() * bar() main::((eval 172):3):
print foo() + bar(); main::foo((eval 168):2):
main::bar((eval 170):2): 42</p>

<p>with this one, once the &quot;o&quot;ption
&quot;frame=2&quot; has been set:</p>

<p>DB&lt;4&gt; o f=2 frame = &rsquo;2&rsquo; DB&lt;5&gt; t
print foo() * bar() 3: foo() * bar() entering main::foo 2:
sub foo { 14 }; exited main::foo entering main::bar 2: sub
bar { 3 }; exited main::bar 42</p>

<p>By way of demonstration, we present below a laborious
listing resulting from setting your &quot;PERLDB_OPTS&quot;
environment variable to the value &quot;f=n N&quot;, and
running perl -d -V from the command line. Examples use
various values of &quot;n&quot; are shown to give you a feel
for the difference between settings. Long those it may be,
this is not a complete listing, but only excerpts.</p>

<p>In all cases shown above, the line indentation shows the
call tree. If bit 2 of &quot;frame&quot; is set, a line is
printed on exit from a subroutine as well. If bit 4 is set,
the arguments are printed along with the caller info. If bit
8 is set, the arguments are printed even if they are tied or
references. If bit 16 is set, the return value is printed,
too.</p>

<p>When a package is compiled, a line like this</p>

<p>Package lib/Carp.pm.</p>

<p>is printed with proper indentation.</p>

<p>Debugging regular expressions There are two ways to
enable debugging output for regular expressions.</p>

<p>If your perl is compiled with &quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;,
you may use the -Dr flag on the command line.</p>

<p>Otherwise, one can &quot;use re
&rsquo;debug&rsquo;&quot;, which has effects at compile time
and run time. It is not lexically scoped.</p>

<p>Compile-time output The debugging output at compile time
looks like this:</p>

<p>Compiling REx &lsquo;[bc]d(ef*g)+h[ij]k$&rsquo; size 45

<p>The first line shows the pre-compiled form of the regex.
The second shows the size of the compiled form (in arbitrary
units, usually 4-byte words) and the total number of bytes
allocated for the offset/length table, usually
4+&quot;size&quot;*8. The next line shows the label id of
the first node that does a match.</p>

at 3..2147483647 (checking floating) stclass
&lsquo;ANYOF[bc]&rsquo; minlen 7</p>

<p>line (split into two lines above) contains optimizer
information. In the example shown, the optimizer found that
the match should contain a substring &quot;de&quot; at
offset 1, plus substring &quot;gh&quot; at some offset
between 3 and infinity. Moreover, when checking for these
substrings (to abandon impossible matches quickly), Perl
will check for the substring &quot;gh&quot; before checking
for the substring &quot;de&quot;. The optimizer may also use
the knowledge that the match starts (at the
&quot;first&quot; id) with a character class, and no string
shorter than 7 characters can possibly match.</p>

<p>The fields of interest which may appear in this line
are</p>

<p>&quot;anchored&quot; STRING &quot;at&quot; POS
&quot;floating&quot; STRING &quot;at&quot; POS1..POS2 See
above.</p>

<p>&quot;matching floating/anchored&quot; Which substring
to check first.</p>

<p>&quot;minlen&quot; The minimal length of the match.</p>

<p>&quot;stclass&quot; TYPE Type of first matching
node.</p>

<p>&quot;noscan&quot; Dont scan for the found
substrings.</p>

<p>&quot;isall&quot; Means that the optimizer information
is all that the regular expression contains, and thus one
does not need to enter the regex engine at all.</p>

<p>&quot;GPOS&quot; Set if the pattern contains
&quot;G&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;plus&quot; Set if the pattern starts with a
repeated char (as in &quot;x+y&quot;).</p>

<p>&quot;implicit&quot; Set if the pattern starts with
&quot;.*&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;with eval&quot; Set if the pattern contain
eval-groups, such as &quot;(?{ code })&quot; and &quot;(??{
code })&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;anchored(TYPE)&quot; If the pattern may match only
at a handful of places, (with &quot;TYPE&quot; being
&quot;BOL&quot;, &quot;MBOL&quot;, or &quot;GPOS&quot;. See
the table below.</p>

<p>If a substring is known to match at end-of-line only, it
may be followed by &quot;$&quot;, as in &quot;floating
&lsquo;k&rsquo;$&quot;.</p>

<p>The optimizer-specific information is used to avoid
entering (a slow) regex engine on strings that will not
definitely match. If the &quot;isall&quot; flag is set, a
call to the regex engine may be avoided even when the
optimizer found an appropriate place for the match.</p>

<p>Above the optimizer section is the list of nodes of the
compiled form of the regex. Each line has format</p>

<p>&quot; &quot;id: TYPE OPTIONAL-INFO (next-id)</p>

<p>Types of nodes Here are the possible types, with short
descriptions:</p>

<p># TYPE arg-description [num-args] [longjump-len]
DESCRIPTION</p>

<p># Exit points END no End of program. SUCCEED no Return
from a subroutine, basically.</p>

<p># Anchors: BOL no Match &quot;&quot; at beginning of
line. MBOL no Same, assuming multiline. SBOL no Same,
assuming singleline. EOS no Match &quot;&quot; at end of
string. EOL no Match &quot;&quot; at end of line. MEOL no
Same, assuming multiline. SEOL no Same, assuming singleline.
BOUND no Match &quot;&quot; at any word boundary BOUNDL no
Match &quot;&quot; at any word boundary NBOUND no Match
&quot;&quot; at any word non-boundary NBOUNDL no Match
&quot;&quot; at any word non-boundary GPOS no Matches where
last m//g left off.</p>

<p># [Special] alternatives ANY no Match any one character
(except newline). SANY no Match any one character. ANYOF sv
Match character in (or not in) this class. ALNUM no Match
any alphanumeric character ALNUML no Match any alphanumeric
char in locale NALNUM no Match any non-alphanumeric
character NALNUML no Match any non-alphanumeric char in
locale SPACE no Match any whitespace character SPACEL no
Match any whitespace char in locale NSPACE no Match any
non-whitespace character NSPACEL no Match any non-whitespace
char in locale DIGIT no Match any numeric character NDIGIT
no Match any non-numeric character</p>

<p># BRANCH The set of branches constituting a single
choice are hooked # together with their &quot;next&quot;
pointers, since precedence prevents # anything being
concatenated to any individual branch. The #
&quot;next&quot; pointer of the last BRANCH in a choice
points to the # thing following the whole choice. This is
also where the # final &quot;next&quot; pointer of each
individual branch points; each # branch starts with the
operand node of a BRANCH node. # BRANCH node Match this
alternative, or the next...</p>

<p># BACK Normal &quot;next&quot; pointers all implicitly
point forward; BACK # exists to make loop structures
possible. # not used BACK no Match &quot;&quot;,
&quot;next&quot; ptr points backward.</p>

<p># Literals EXACT sv Match this string (preceded by
length). EXACTF sv Match this string, folded (prec. by
length). EXACTFL sv Match this string, folded in locale
(w/len).</p>

<p># Do nothing NOTHING no Match empty string. # A variant
of above which delimits a group, thus stops optimizations
TAIL no Match empty string. Can jump here from outside.</p>

<p># STAR,PLUS &rsquo;?&rsquo;, and complex &rsquo;*&rsquo;
and &rsquo;+&rsquo;, are implemented as circular # BRANCH
structures using BACK. Simple cases (one character # per
match) are implemented with STAR and PLUS for speed # and to
minimize recursive plunges. # STAR node Match this (simple)
thing 0 or more times. PLUS node Match this (simple) thing 1
or more times.</p>

<p>CURLY sv 2 Match this simple thing {n,m} times. CURLYN
no 2 Match next-after-this simple thing # {n,m} times, set
parens. CURLYM no 2 Match this medium-complex thing {n,m}
times. CURLYX sv 2 Match this complex thing {n,m} times.</p>

<p># This terminator creates a loop structure for CURLYX
WHILEM no Do curly processing and see if rest matches.</p>

<p># OPEN,CLOSE,GROUPP ...are numbered at compile time.
OPEN num 1 Mark this point in input as start of #n. CLOSE
num 1 Analogous to OPEN.</p>

<p>REF num 1 Match some already matched string REFF num 1
Match already matched string, folded REFFL num 1 Match
already matched string, folded in loc.</p>

<p># grouping assertions IFMATCH off 1 2 Succeeds if the

<p>Following the optimizer information is a dump of the
offset/length table, here split across several lines:</p>

<p>Offsets: [45] 1[4] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0]
0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 5[1] 0[0] 12[1] 0[0] 6[1] 0[0] 7[1] 0[0] 9[1]
8[1] 0[0] 10[1] 0[0] 11[1] 0[0] 12[0] 12[0] 13[1] 0[0] 14[4]
0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 0[0] 18[1] 0[0]
19[1] 20[0]</p>

<p>The first line here indicates that the offset/length
table contains 45 entries. Each entry is a pair of integers,
denoted by &quot;offset[length]&quot;. Entries are numbered
starting with 1, so entry #1 here is &quot;1[4]&quot; and
entry #12 is &quot;5[1]&quot;. &quot;1[4]&quot; indicates
that the node labeled &quot;1:&quot; (the &quot;1:
ANYOF[bc]&quot;) begins at character position 1 in the
pre-compiled form of the regex, and has a length of 4
characters. &quot;5[1]&quot; in position 12 indicates that
the node labeled &quot;12:&quot; (the &quot;12: EXACT
&lt;d&gt;&quot;) begins at character position 5 in the
pre-compiled form of the regex, and has a length of 1
character. &quot;12[1]&quot; in position 14 indicates that
the node labeled &quot;14:&quot; (the &quot;14: CURLYX[0]
{1,32767}&quot;) begins at character position 12 in the
pre-compiled form of the regex, and has a length of 1
character---that is, it corresponds to the &quot;+&quot;
symbol in the precompiled regex.</p>

<p>&quot;0[0]&quot; items indicate that there is no
corresponding node.</p>

<p>Run-time output First of all, when doing a match, one
may get no run-time output even if debugging is enabled.
This means that the regex engine was never entered and that
all of the job was therefore done by the optimizer.</p>

<p>If the regex engine was entered, the output may look
like this:</p>

<p>Matching &lsquo;[bc]d(ef*g)+h[ij]k$&rsquo; against
&lsquo;abcdefg__gh__&rsquo; Setting an EVAL scope,

&lt;h&gt; failed... failed...</p>

<p>The most significant information in the output is about
the particular node of the compiled regex that is currently
being tested against the target string. The format of these
lines is</p>

<p>&quot; &quot;STRING-OFFSET &lt;PRE-STRING&gt;
&lt;POST-STRING&gt; |ID: TYPE</p>

<p>The TYPE info is indented with respect to the
backtracking level. Other incidental information appears
interspersed within.</p>

<p>Debugging Perl memory usage Perl is a profligate wastrel
when it comes to memory use. There is a saying that to
estimate memory usage of Perl, assume a reasonable algorithm
for memory allocation, multiply that estimate by 10, and
while you still may miss the mark, at least you won t be
quite so astonished. This is not absolutely true, but may
provide a good grasp of what happens.</p>

<p>Assume that an integer cannot take less than 20 bytes of
memory, a float cannot take less than 24 bytes, a string
cannot take less than 32 bytes (all these examples assume
32-bit architectures, the result are quite a bit worse on
64-bit architectures). If a variable is accessed in two of
three different ways (which require an integer, a float, or
a string), the memory footprint may increase yet another 20
bytes. A sloppy malloc(3) implementation can inflate these
numbers dramatically.</p>

<p>On the opposite end of the scale, a declaration like</p>

<p>sub foo;</p>

<p>may take up to 500 bytes of memory, depending on which
release of Perl youre running.</p>

<p>Anecdotal estimates of source-to-compiled code bloat
suggest an eightfold increase. This means that the compiled
form of reasonable (normally commented, properly indented
etc.) code will take about eight times more space in memory
than the code took on disk.</p>

<p>The -DL command-line switch is obsolete since circa Perl
5.6.0 (it was available only if Perl was built with
&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;). The switch was used to track Perls
memory allocations and possible memory leaks. These days the
use of malloc debugging tools like Purify or valgrind is
suggested instead. See also &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot; in
perlhack.</p>

<p>One way to find out how much memory is being used by
Perl data structures is to install the Devel::Size module
from CPAN: it gives you the minimum number of bytes required
to store a particular data structure. Please be mindful of
the difference between the size() and total_size().</p>

<p>If Perl has been compiled using Perls malloc you can
analyze Perl memory usage by setting the
$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}.</p>

<p>Using $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} If your perl is using
Perls malloc() and was compiled with the necessary switches
(this is the default), then it will print memory usage
statistics after compiling your code when
&quot;$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} &gt; 1&quot;, and before
termination of the program when
&quot;$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} &gt;= 1&quot;. The report
format is similar to the following example:</p>

<p>$ PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl -e &quot;require Carp&quot;
Memory allocation statistics after compilation: (buckets
4(4)..8188(8192) 14216 free: 130 117 28 7 9 0 2 2 1 0 0 437
61 36 0 5 60924 used: 125 137 161 55 7 8 6 16 2 0 1 74 109
304 84 20 Total sbrk(): 77824/21:119. Odd ends:
pad+heads+chain+tail: 0+636+0+2048. Memory allocation
statistics after execution: (buckets 4(4)..8188(8192) 30888
free: 245 78 85 13 6 2 1 3 2 0 1 315 162 39 42 11 175816
used: 265 176 1112 111 26 22 11 27 2 1 1 196 178 1066 798 39
Total sbrk(): 215040/47:145. Odd ends: pad+heads+chain+tail:
0+2192+0+6144.</p>

<p>It is possible to ask for such a statistic at arbitrary
points in your execution using the mstat() function out of
the standard Devel::Peek module.</p>

<p>Here is some explanation of that format:</p>

<p>&quot;buckets SMALLEST(APPROX)..GREATEST(APPROX)&quot;
Perl s malloc() uses bucketed allocations. Every request is
rounded up to the closest bucket size available, and a
bucket is taken from the pool of buckets of that size.</p>

<p>The line above describes the limits of buckets currently
in use. Each bucket has two sizes: memory footprint and the
maximal size of user data that can fit into this bucket.
Suppose in the above example that the smallest bucket were
size 4. The biggest bucket would have usable size 8188, and
the memory footprint would be 8192.</p>

<p>In a Perl built for debugging, some buckets may have
negative usable size. This means that these buckets cannot
(and will not) be used. For larger buckets, the memory
footprint may be one page greater than a power of 2. If so,
case the corresponding power of two is printed in the
&quot;APPROX&quot; field above.</p>

<p>Free/Used The 1 or 2 rows of numbers following that
correspond to the number of buckets of each size between
&quot;SMALLEST&quot; and &quot;GREATEST&quot;. In the first
row, the sizes (memory footprints) of buckets are powers of
two--or possibly one page greater. In the second row, if
present, the memory footprints of the buckets are between
the memory footprints of two buckets &quot;above&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, suppose under the previous example, the
memory footprints were</p>

<p>free: 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 4 12 24
48 80</p>

<p>With non-&quot;DEBUGGING&quot; perl, the buckets
starting from 128 have a 4-byte overhead, and thus an
8192-long bucket may take up to 8188-byte allocations.</p>

<p>&quot;Total sbrk(): SBRKed/SBRKs:CONTINUOUS&quot; The
first two fields give the total amount of memory perl
sbrk(2)ed (ess-broken? :-) and number of sbrk(2)s used. The
third number is what perl thinks about continuity of
returned chunks. So long as this number is positive,
malloc() will assume that it is probable that sbrk(2) will
provide continuous memory.</p>

<p>Memory allocated by external libraries is not
counted.</p>

<p>&quot;pad: 0&quot; The amount of sbrk(2)ed memory needed
to keep buckets aligned.</p>

<p>&quot;heads: 2192&quot; Although memory overhead of
bigger buckets is kept inside the bucket, for smaller
buckets, it is kept in separate areas. This field gives the
total size of these areas.</p>

<p>&quot;chain: 0&quot; malloc() may want to subdivide a
bigger bucket into smaller buckets. If only a part of the
deceased bucket is left unsubdivided, the rest is kept as an
element of a linked list. This field gives the total size of
these chunks.</p>

<p>&quot;tail: 6144&quot; To minimize the number of
sbrk(2)s, malloc() asks for more memory. This field gives
the size of the yet unused part, which is sbrk(2)ed, but
never touched.</p>
