<p>RLOGIN(1) BSD General Commands Manual RLOGIN(1)</p>

<p>NAME rlogin - remote login</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rlogin [-8EKLdx] [-e char] [-l username]
host</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rlogin starts a terminal session on a remote
host host.</p>

<p>The standard Berkeley rhosts authorization mechanism is
used. The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-8 The -8 option allows an eight-bit input data path at
all times; otherwise parity bits are stripped except when
the remote sides stop and start characters are other than
^S/^Q .</p>

<p>-E The -E option stops any character from being
recognized as an escape character. When used with the -8
option, this provides a completely transparent
connection.</p>

<p>-L The -L option allows the rlogin session to be run in
litout (see tty(4)) mode.</p>

<p>-d The -d option turns on socket debugging (see
setsockopt(2)) on the TCP sockets used for communication
with the remote host.</p>

<p>-e The -e option allows user specification of the escape
character, which is ~ by default. This specification may be
as a literal character, or as an octal value in the form
0n.</p>

<p>A line of the form &lt;escape char&gt;. disconnects from
the remote host. Similarly, the line &lt;escape char&gt;^Z
will suspend the rlogin session, and &lt;escape
char&gt;&lt;delayed-suspend char&gt; suspends the send
portion of the rlogin, but allows output from the remote
system. By default, the tilde (~) character is the escape
character, and normally control-Y (^Y) is the
delayed-suspend character.</p>

<p>All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that
(except for delays) the rlogin is transparent. Flow control
via ^S/^Q and flushing of input and output on interrupts are
handled properly.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The following environment variable is
utilized by rlogin:</p>

<p>TERM Determines the users terminal type.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rsh(1),</p>

<p>HISTORY The rlogin command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS Rlogin will be replaced by telnet(1) in the near
future.</p>

<p>More of the environment should be propagated.</p>
