<p>XtResolvePathname(3) XT FUNCTIONS
XtResolvePathname(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtResolvePathname - search for a file using
standard substitution</p>

<p>SYNTAX String XtResolvePathname(Display *display, String
type, String file- name, String suffix, String path,
Substitution substitutions, Cardinal num_substitutions,
XtFilePredicate predicate);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the display to use to find
the language for lan- guage substitutions.</p>

<p>type filename suffix Specify values to substitute into
the path.</p>

<p>path Specifies the list of file specifications, or
NULL.</p>

<p>substitutions Specifies a list of additional
substitutions to make into the path, or NULL.</p>

<p>num_substitutions Specifies the number of entries in
substitutions.</p>

<p>predicate Specifies a procedure called to judge each
potential file name, or NULL.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The substitutions specified by
XtResolvePathname are determined from the value of the
language string retrieved by XtDisplayInitialize for the
specified display. To set the language for all applications
spec- ify *xnlLanguage: lang in the resource database. The
format and content of the language string are
implementation-defined. One sug- gested syntax is to compose
the language string of three parts; a language part , a
territory part and a codeset part. The manner in which this
composition is accomplished is implementation- defined and
the Intrinsics make no interpretation of the parts other
than to use them in substitutions as described below.</p>

<p>XtResolvePathname calls XtFindFile with the following
substitutions in addition to any passed by the caller and
returns the value returned by XtFindFile:</p>

<p>%N The value of the filename parameter, or the
applications class name if filename is NULL.</p>

<p>%T The value of the type parameter.</p>

<p>%S The value of the suffix parameter.</p>

<p>%L The language string associated with the specified
display.</p>

<p>%l The language part of the displays language
string.</p>

<p>%t The territory part of the displays language
string.</p>

<p>%c The codeset part of the displays language string.</p>

<p>%C The customization string retrieved from the resource
database associated with display.</p>

<p>%D The value of the implementation-specific default
path.</p>

<p>If a path is passed to XtResolvePathname, it will be
passed along to XtFindFile. If the path argument is NULL,
the value of the XFILE- SEARCHPATH environment variable will
be passed to XtFindFile. If XFILESEARCHPATH is not defined,
an implementation-specific default path will be used which
contains at least 6 entries. These entries must contain the
following substitutions:</p>

<p>1. %C, %N, %S, %T, %L or %C, %N, %S, %T, %l, %t, %c 2.
%C, %N, %S, %T, %l 3. %C, %N, %S, %T 4. %N, %S, %T, %L or
%N, %S, %T, %l, %t, %c 5. %N, %S, %T, %l 6. %N, %S, %T</p>

<p>The order of these six entries within the path must be
as given above. The order and use of substitutions within a
given entry is implementa- tion dependent. If the path
begins with a colon, it will be preceded by %N%S. If the
path includes two adjacent colons, %N%S will be inserted
between them.</p>

<p>The type parameter is intended to be a category of
files, usually being translated into a directory in the
pathname. Possible values might include app-defaults, help,
and bitmap.</p>

<p>The suffix parameter is intended to be appended to the
file name. Pos- sible values might include .txt, .dat, and
.bm.</p>

<p>A suggested value for the default path on POSIX-based
systems is</p>

<p>/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S:/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S:
/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S:/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S:
/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S</p>

<p>Using this example, if the user has specified a
language, it will be used as a subdirectory of /usr/lib/X11
that will be searched for other files. If the desired file
is not found there, the lookup will be tried again using
just the language part of the specification. If the file is
not there, it will be looked for in /usr/lib/X11. The type
parameter is used as a subdirectory of the language
directory or of /usr/lib/X11, and suffix is appended to the
file name.</p>

<p>The %D substitution allows the addition of path elements
to the imple- mentation-specific default path, typically to
allow additional directo- ries to be searched without
preventing resources in the system directo- ries from being
found. For example, a user installing resource files under a
directory called ourdir might set XFILESEARCHPATH to</p>

<p>%D:ourdir/%T/%N%C:ourdir/%T/%N</p>

<p>The customization string is obtained by querying the
resource database currently associated with the display (the
database returned by XrmGet- Database) for the resource
application_name.customization, class appli-
cation_class.Customization where application_name and
application_class are the values returned by
XtGetApplicationNameAndClass. If no value is specified in
the database, the empty string is used.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the caller to free the
returned string using XtFree when it is no longer
needed.</p>
