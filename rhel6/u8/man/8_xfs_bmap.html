<p>NAME xfs_bmap - print block mapping for an XFS file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_bmap [ -adlpv ] [ -n num_extents ] file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_bmap prints the map of disk blocks used
by files in an XFS filesys- tem. The map lists each extent
used by the file, as well as regions in the file that do not
have any corresponding blocks (holes). Each line of the
listings takes the following form:</p>

<p>extent: [startoffset..endoffset]:
startblock..endblock</p>

<p>Holes are marked by replacing the startblock..endblock
with hole. All the file offsets and disk blocks are in units
of 512-byte blocks, no matter what the filesystems block
size is.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a If this option is specified, information
about the files attribute fork is printed instead of the
default data fork.</p>

<p>-d If portions of the file have been migrated offline by
a DMAPI application, a DMAPI read event will be generated to
bring those portions back online before the disk block map
is printed. How- ever if the -d option is used, no DMAPI
read event will be gen- erated for a DMAPI file and offline
portions will be reported as holes.</p>

<p>-l If this option is used, then</p>

<p>&lt;nblocks&gt; blocks</p>

<p>will be appended to each line. nblocks is the length of
the extent described on the line in units of 512-byte
blocks.</p>

<p>This flag has no effect if the -v option is used.</p>

<p>-n num_extents If this option is given, xfs_bmap obtains
the extent list of the file in groups of num_extents
extents. In the absence of -n, xfs_bmap queries the system
for the number of extents in the file and uses that value to
compute the group size.</p>

<p>-p If this option is used, xfs_bmap obtains all
unwritten (preallo- cated) extents that do not contain
written data. With the -v option, the flags column will show
which extents are preallo- cated/unwritten.</p>

<p>-v Shows verbose information. When this flag is
specified, addi- tional AG specific information is appended
to each line in the following form:</p>

<p>agno (startagoffset..endagoffset) nblocks flags</p>

<p>A second -v option will print out the flags legend.</p>
