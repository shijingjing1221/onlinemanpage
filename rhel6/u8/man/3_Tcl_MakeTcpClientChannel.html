Tcl_OpenTcpClient(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_OpenTcpClient, Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel,
Tcl_OpenTcpServer - proce- dures to open channels using TCP
sockets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel Tcl_OpenTcpClient(interp, port, host,
myaddr, myport, async)</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel(sock)</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel Tcl_OpenTcpServer(interp, port, myaddr,
proc, clientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter to use
for error reporting. If non- NULL and an error occurs, an
error message is left in the interpreter s result.</p>

<p>int port (in) A port number to connect to as a client or
to listen on as a server.</p>

<p>const char *host (in) A string specifying a host name or
address for the remote end of the connec- tion.</p>

<p>int myport (in) A port number for the clients end of the
socket. If 0, a port number is allo- cated at random.</p>

<p>const char *myaddr (in) A string specifying the host
name or address for network interface to use for the local
end of the connection. If NULL, a default interface is
chosen.</p>

<p>int async (in) If nonzero, the client socket is
connected asyn- chronously to the server.</p>

<p>ClientData sock (in) Platform-specific handle for client
TCP socket.</p>

<p>Tcl_TcpAcceptProc *proc (in) Pointer to a procedure to
invoke each time a new con- nection is accepted via the
socket.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions are convenience procedures
for creating channels that communicate over TCP sockets. The
operations on a channel are described in the manual entry
for Tcl_OpenFileChannel.</p>

<p>TCL_OPENTCPCLIENT Tcl_OpenTcpClient opens a client TCP
socket connected to a port on a specific host, and returns a
channel that can be used to communicate with the server. The
host to connect to can be specified either as a domain name
style name (e.g. www.sunlabs.com), or as a string contain-
ing the alphanumeric representation of its four-byte address
(e.g. 127.0.0.1). Use the string localhost to connect to a
TCP socket on the host on which the function is invoked.</p>

<p>The myaddr and myport arguments allow a client to
specify an address for the local end of the connection. If
myaddr is NULL, then an inter- face is chosen automatically
by the operating system. If myport is 0, then a port number
is chosen at random by the operating system.</p>

<p>If async is zero, the call to Tcl_OpenTcpClient returns
only after the client socket has either successfully
connected to the server, or the attempted connection has
failed. If async is nonzero the socket is connected
asynchronously and the returned channel may not yet be con-
nected to the server when the call to Tcl_OpenTcpClient
returns. If the channel is in blocking mode and an input or
output operation is done on the channel before the
connection is completed or fails, that operation will wait
until the connection either completes successfully or fails.
If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the input or output
operation will return immediately and a subsequent call to
Tcl_InputBlocked on the channel will return nonzero.</p>

<p>The returned channel is opened for reading and writing.
If an error occurs in opening the socket, Tcl_OpenTcpClient
returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that can be
retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. In addition, if interp is
non-NULL, an error message is left in the inter- preters
result.</p>

<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied inter- preter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel. If one of the stan- dard channels,
stdin, stdout or stderr was previously closed, the act of
creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement
for the standard channel.</p>

<p>TCL_MAKETCPCLIENTCHANNEL Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel
creates a Tcl_Channel around an existing, platform specific,
handle for a client TCP socket.</p>

<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied inter- preter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel. If one of the stan- dard channels,
stdin, stdout or stderr was previously closed, the act of
creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement
for the standard channel.</p>

<p>TCL_OPENTCPSERVER Tcl_OpenTcpServer opens a TCP socket
on the local host on a specified port and uses the Tcl event
mechanism to accept requests from clients to connect to it.
The myaddr argument specifies the network interface. If
myaddr is NULL the special address INADDR_ANY should be used
to allow connections from any network interface. Each time a
client con- nects to this socket, Tcl creates a channel for
the new connection and invokes proc with information about
the channel. Proc must match the following prototype:
typedef void Tcl_TcpAcceptProc( ClientData clientData,
Tcl_Channel channel, char *hostName, int port);</p>

<p>The clientData argument will be the same as the
clientData argument to Tcl_OpenTcpServer, channel will be
the handle for the new channel, hostName points to a string
containing the name of the client host mak- ing the
connection, and port will contain the client s port number.
The new channel is opened for both input and output. If proc
raises an error, the connection is closed automatically.
Proc has no return value, but if it wishes to reject the
connection it can close channel.</p>

<p>Tcl_OpenTcpServer normally returns a pointer to a
channel representing the server socket. If an error occurs,
Tcl_OpenTcpServer returns NULL and records a POSIX error
code that can be retrieved with Tcl_GetErrno. In addition,
if the interpreter is non-NULL, an error message is left in
the interpreters result.</p>

<p>The channel returned by Tcl_OpenTcpServer cannot be used
for either input or output. It is simply a handle for the
socket used to accept connections. The caller can close the
channel to shut down the server and disallow further
connections from new clients.</p>

<p>TCP server channels operate correctly only in
applications that dis- patch events through Tcl_DoOneEvent
or through Tcl commands such as vwait; otherwise Tcl will
never notice that a connection request from a remote client
is pending.</p>

<p>The newly created channel is not registered in the
supplied inter- preter; to register it, use
Tcl_RegisterChannel. If one of the stan- dard channels,
stdin, stdout or stderr was previously closed, the act of
creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement
for the standard channel.</p>

<p>PLATFORM ISSUES On Unix platforms, the socket handle is
a Unix file descriptor as returned by the socket system
call. On the Windows platform, the socket handle is a SOCKET
as defined in the WinSock API.</p>
