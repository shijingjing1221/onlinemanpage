<p>NAME udevd - event managing daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS udevd [--daemon] [--debug-trace] [--debug]
[--version] [--resolve-names=early|late|never] [--help]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION udevd listens to kernel uevents and passes
the incoming events to udev. It ensures the correct event
order and takes care, that events for child devices are
delayed until the parent event has finished the device
handling. The behavior of the running daemon can be changed
with udevadm control.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --daemon Detach and run in the background.</p>

<p>--debug-trace Run all events completely serialized. This
may be useful if udev triggers actions or loads kernel
modules which cause problems and a slow but continuous
operation is needed, where no events are processed in
parallel.</p>

<p>--debug Print debug messages to stderr.</p>

<p>--resolve-names Specify when udevd should resolve names
of users and groups. When set to early (the default) names
will be resolved when the rules are parsed. When set to late
names will be resolved for every event. When set to never
names will never be resolved and all devices will be owned
by root.</p>

<p>--version Print version number.</p>

<p>--help Print help text.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT UDEV_LOG Overrides the syslog priority
specified in the config file.</p>
