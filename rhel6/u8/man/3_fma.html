<p>FMA(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FMA(3)</p>

<p>NAME fma, fmaf, fmal - floating-point multiply and
add</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double fma(double x, double y, double z); float
fmaf(float x, float y, float z); long double fmal(long
double x, long double y, long double z);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>fma(), fmaf(), fmal(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 ||
_ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fma() function computes x * y + z. The
result is rounded as one ternary operation according to the
current rounding mode (see fenv(3)).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions return the value of x * y +
z, rounded as one ternary operation.</p>

<p>If x or y is a NaN, a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If x times y is an exact infinity, and z is an infinity
with the oppo- site sign, a domain error occurs, and a NaN
is returned.</p>

<p>If one of x or y is an infinity, the other is 0, and z
is not a NaN, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is
returned.</p>

<p>If one of x or y is an infinity, and the other is 0, and
z is a NaN, a domain error occurs, and a NaN is
returned.</p>

<p>If x times y is not an infinity times zero (or vice
versa), and z is a NaN, a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and an
infinity with the correct sign is returned.</p>

<p>If the result underflows, a range error occurs, and a
signed 0 is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS See math_error(7) for information on how to
determine whether an error has occurred when calling these
functions.</p>

<p>The following errors can occur:</p>

<p>Domain error: x * y + z, or x * y is invalid and z is
not a NaN An invalid floating-point exception (FE_INVALID)
is raised.</p>

<p>Range error: result overflow An overflow floating-point
exception (FE_OVERFLOW) is raised.</p>

<p>Range error: result underflow An underflow
floating-point exception (FE_UNDERFLOW) is raised.</p>

<p>These functions do not set errno.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions first appeared in glibc in
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
