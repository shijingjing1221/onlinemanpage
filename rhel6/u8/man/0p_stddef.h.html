<p>&lt;stddef.h&gt;(0P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
&lt;stddef.h&gt;(0P)</p>

<p>NAME stddef.h - standard type definitions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stddef.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;stddef.h&gt; header shall define the
following macros:</p>

<p>NULL Null pointer constant.</p>

<p>offsetof(type, member-designator)</p>

<p>Integer constant expression of type size_t, the value of
which is the offset in bytes to the structure member
(member-designa- tor), from the beginning of its structure
(type).</p>

<p>The &lt;stddef.h&gt; header shall define the following
types:</p>

<p>ptrdiff_t Signed integer type of the result of
subtracting two pointers.</p>

<p>wchar_t Integer type whose range of values can represent
distinct wide- character codes for all members of the
largest character set specified among the locales supported
by the compilation envi- ronment: the null character has the
code value 0 and each member of the portable character set
has a code value equal to its value when used as the lone
character in an integer character constant.</p>

<p>size_t Unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof
operator.</p>

<p>The implementation shall support one or more programming
environments in which the widths of ptrdiff_t, size_t, and
wchar_t are no greater than the width of type long. The
names of these programming environ- ments can be obtained
using the confstr() function or the getconf util- ity.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
