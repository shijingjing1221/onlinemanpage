<p>NAME avmcapictrl - Add, reset or remove active AVM cards
and load firmware</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS avmcapictrl add &lt;portbase&gt; &lt;irq&gt;
&lt;type&gt; avmcapictrl load &lt;bootcode&gt;
[&lt;contrnr&gt; [&lt;protocol&gt; [P2P |

&lt;driver&gt; &lt;portbase&gt; &lt;irq&gt; [
&lt;membase&gt; [ &lt;cardnr&gt; ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION avmcapictrl is used to register active AVM
ISA cards kernelcapi system and therewith to the isdn
system. You need it also to upload the firmware to any
active AVM card. If an error occure please also check the
kernel error messages by using the command dmesg(8).</p>

<p>COMMANDS add &lt;portbase&gt; &lt;irq&gt; &lt;type&gt;
is used to add a ISA card to the kernel-capi2.0 system. The
port- base can have the values 0x150, 0x250, 0x300 and 0x340
for the B1 ISA cards, look at the jumper on the card. For a
T1-ISA (HEMA) card you can select an wide range of ports.
irq can be selected from the following values: 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15. type can be B1 or T1.</p>

<p>load &lt;bootcode&gt; [&lt;contrnr&gt; [&lt;protocol&gt;
[P2P | &lt;dn1&gt;:&lt;spid1&gt;
[&lt;dn2&gt;:&lt;spid2&gt;]]]] is used to load the firmware
to a card bootcode is a t4-file. The actual versions of the
t4-files for the different d-channel protocols can be found
at ftp://ftp.avm.de/cardware/b1/linux/firmware. You need
different t4-files for different d channel protocols:
b1-1tr6.t4 for 1TR6, b1.t4 for DSS1 and b1-usa.t4 for 5ESS
and NI1 (DSS1 is also supported). For M1/M2 PCMCIA cards you
need m1-s10.t4 or m1-s4.t4 depending on the handy type used.
contrnr is the number of the controller (card) starting from
1. protocol can be DSS1, CT1, VN3, AUSTEL, 5ESS or NI1. P2P
point to point DN1:SPID1 DN2:SPID2 is for the american
protocols 5ESS and NI1.</p>

<p>reset [contrnr] is used to reset a card if loading has
failed. This function only make sence if card is not
successfully loaded. contrnr is the number of the controller
(card) starting from 1.</p>

<p>remove [contrnr] is used to remove a card previous
added. You can also remove auto- matic added cards (for
example a B1-PCI card). contrnr is the number of the
controller (card) starting from 1.</p>

<p>trace [contrnr] [off|short|on|full|shortnodata|nodata]
is used to trace CAPI2.0 messages. The trace will be done as
ker- nel messages, see dmesg(8). contrnr is the number of
the controller (card) starting from 1. off switch traceing
off short switch one line per CAPI2.0 message tracing on on
| full switch on full decode tracing shortnodata switch on
line per CAPI2.0 message tracing on, but exclude DATA_B3_IND
and DATA_B3_REQ messages. on | full switch on full decode
tracing, but exclude DATA_B3_IND and DATA_B3_REQ
messages.</p>

<p>addcard &lt;driver&gt; &lt;portbase&gt; &lt;irq&gt; [
&lt;membase&gt; [ &lt;cardnr&gt; ] ] is used to add a card,
this is more generic than add. driver currently b1isa or
t1isa portbase can have the values 0x150, 0x250, 0x300 and
0x340 for the b1isa driver, look at the jumper on the card.
For t1isa driver you can select an wide range of ports. irq
can be selected from the following values: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9,
10, 11, 12 and 15. membase memory address if needed by
driver cardnr only usefull with driver t1isa</p>
