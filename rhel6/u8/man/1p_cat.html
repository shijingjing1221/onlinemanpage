<p>CAT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CAT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cat - concatenate and print files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cat [-u][file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cat utility shall read files in sequence
and shall write their con- tents to the standard output in
the same sequence.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The cat utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-u Write bytes from the input file to the standard
output without delay as each is read.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If no file operands
are specified, the standard input shall be used. If a file
is -, the cat utility shall read from the standard input at
that point in the sequence. The cat utility shall not close
and reopen standard input when it is referenced in this way,
but shall accept multi- ple occurrences of-as a file
operand.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is-. See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files can be any file type.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of cat:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall contain the sequence of
bytes read from the input files. Nothing else shall be
written to the standard output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were output successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The -u option has value in prototyping
non-blocking reads from FIFOs. The intent is to support the
following sequence:</p>

<p>mkfifo foo cat -u foo &gt; /dev/tty13 &amp; cat -u &gt;
foo</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether standard output is or is not
buffered in the default case. This is sometimes of interest
when standard output is associated with a terminal, since
buffering may delay the output. The presence of the -u
option guarantees that unbuffered I/O is available. It is
implementation-defined whether the cat utility buffers
output if the -u option is not specified. Traditionally, the
-u option is imple- mented using the equivalent of the
setvbuf() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following command:</p>

<p>cat myfile</p>

<p>writes the contents of the file myfile to standard
output.</p>

<p>The following command:</p>

<p>cat doc1 doc2 &gt; doc.all</p>

<p>concatenates the files doc1 and doc2 and writes the
result to doc.all.</p>

<p>Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform
output redirec- tion, a command such as this:</p>

<p>cat doc doc.end &gt; doc</p>

<p>causes the original data in doc to be lost.</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>cat start - middle - end &gt; file</p>

<p>when standard input is a terminal, gets two arbitrary
pieces of input from the terminal with a single invocation
of cat. Note, however, that if standard input is a regular
file, this would be equivalent to the command:</p>

<p>cat start - middle /dev/null end &gt; file</p>

<p>because the entire contents of the file would be
consumed by cat the first time-was used as a file operand
and an end-of-file condition would be detected immediately
when - was referenced the second time.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Historical versions of the cat utility include
the options -e, -t, and -v, which permit the ends of lines,
&lt;tab&gt;s, and invisible characters, respectively, to be
rendered visible in the output. The standard devel- opers
omitted these options because they provide too fine a degree
of control over what is made visible, and similar output can
be obtained using a command such as:</p>

<p>sed -n -es/$/$/-e l pathname</p>

<p>The -s option was omitted because it corresponds to
different functions in BSD and System V-based systems. The
BSD -s option to squeeze blank lines can be accomplished by
the shell script shown in the following example:</p>

<p>sed -n # Write non-empty lines. /./ { p d } # Write a
single empty line, then look for more empty lines. /^$/ p #
Get next line, discard the held &lt;newline&gt; (empty
line), # and look for more empty lines. :Empty /^$/ { N
s/.// b Empty } # Write the non-empty line before going back
to search # for the first in a set of empty lines. p</p>

<p>The System V -s option to silence error messages can be
accomplished by redirecting the standard error. Note that
the BSD documentation for cat uses the term &quot;blank
line&quot; to mean the same as the POSIX &quot;empty line: a
line consisting only of a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>The BSD -n option was omitted because similar
functionality can be obtained from the -n option of the pr
utility.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
