<p>sane-sm3600(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-sm3600(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-sm3600 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners
with M011 USB chip</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-sm3600 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
some Microtek scanners with the Toshiba M011 custom USB
chip. This backend should be considered alpha.</p>

<p>There are also backends for Microtek scanners with SCSI
command set. Refer to sane-microtek(5) and sane-microtek2(5)
for details.</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known positively
to work with this backend:</p>

<p>Vendor Product id: Remark: -------- --------------
----------- Microtek ScanMaker 3600 all modes ok Microtek
ScanMaker 3700 reported to work Microtek ScanMaker 3750
reported to work</p>

<p>If you own a Microtek scanner with the M011 chip other
than the ones listed above, it may or may not work with
SANE!</p>

<p>FRONTEND OPTIONS This backend dynamically enables the
options for the frontend, that are supported by the scanner
in dependence of the scanning-mode and other options. Not
supported options are disabled.</p>

<p>The following options are supported by the
Microtek2-driver:</p>

<p>Color, grayscale, halftone and lineart scans.</p>

<p>contrast, brightness, control, gamma correction.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend does not support device names
in a standardized form.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION This backend does not support a
configuration file right now.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sm3600.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-sm3600.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_SM3600 If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity. To see error messages on
stderr set SANE_DEBUG_SM3600 to 1.</p>

<p>E.g. just say: export SANE_DEBUG_SM3600=5</p>
