<p>NAME rmnews - expunge and remove news articles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmnews</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rmnews reads article data from the standard
input. It then expunges and removes the listed articles.
Rmnews is designed to be used by InterNetNews to remove
canceled, superseded, and expired news articles.</p>

<p>The input is processed as an INN expirerm file listing
or an INN cancel stream written as a WC entry in the
newsfeeds(5) file. This data consists of lines of text, each
containing a list of relative article pathnames, with a
single space between entries. If a listed file is contained
in an IMAP news mailbox, it is expunged out of that mailbox.
In any case, each listed file is unlinked.</p>

<p>Rmnews reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file. The optional newsprefix option specifies
a prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make the
corresponding IMAP mailbox names. The required
partition-news option specifies the pathname prefix to the
IMAP news mailboxes. The value of partition-news
concatenated with the dots-to-slashes-converted value of
newsprefix must be the pathname of the news spool
directory.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/imapd.conf</p>
