<p>MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy(library
cMrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy(library call)</p>

<p>NAME MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy Registers the values
associated with the names referenced in UIL within a single
hierarchy (for example, UIL callback function names or UIL
identifier names)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Mrm/MrmPublic.h&gt; Cardinal
MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy( MrmHierarchy hierarchy_id,
MrmRegisterArglist register_list, MrmCount
register_count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy function
registers a vector of names and associated values for access
in MRM. The values can be callback functions, pointers to
user-defined data, or any other values. The information
provided is used to resolve symbolic references occurring in
UID files to their run-time values. For callbacks, this
information provides the procedure address required by the
Motif Toolkit. For names used as identifiers in UIL, this
information provides any run- time mapping the application
needs.</p>

<p>This function is similar to MrmRegisterNames, except
that the scope of the names registered by
MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy is limited to the hierarchy
specified by hierarchy_id, whereas the names registered by
MrmRegisterNames have global scope. When MRM looks up a
name, it first tries to find the name among those registered
for the given hierarchy. If that lookup fails, it tries to
find the name among those registered globally.</p>

<p>hierarchy_id Specifies the hierarchy with which the
names are to be asso- ciated.</p>

<p>register_list Specifies a list of name/value pairs for
the names to be reg- istered. Each name is a case-sensitive,
NULL-terminated ASCII string. Each value is a 32-bit
quantity, interpreted as a procedure address if the name is
a callback function, and uninterpreted otherwise.</p>

<p>register_count Specifies the number of entries in
register_list.</p>

<p>The names in the list are case-sensitive. The list can
be either ordered or unordered.</p>

<p>Callback functions registered through
MrmRegisterNamesInHierarchy can be either regular or
creation callbacks. Regular callbacks have decla- rations
determined by Motif Toolkit and user requirements. Creation
callbacks have the same format as any other callback:</p>

<p>void CallBackProc( Widget *widget_id, Opaque tag,
XmAnyCallbackStruct *callback_data);</p>

<p>widget_id Specifies the widget ID associated with the
widget performing the callback (as in any callback
function).</p>

<p>tag Specifies the tag value (as in any callback
function).</p>

<p>callback_data Specifies a widget-specific data
structure. This data struc- ture has a minimum of two
members: event and reason. The reason member is always set
to MrmCR_CREATE.</p>

<p>Note that the widget name and parent are available from
the widget record accessible through widget_id.</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns one of the following status
return constants:</p>

<p>MrmSUCCESS The function executed successfully.</p>

<p>MrmFAILURE The function failed.</p>
