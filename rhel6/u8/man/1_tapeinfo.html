<p>NAME tapeinfo - report SCSI tape device info</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tapeinfo -f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tapeinfo command reads various
information from SCSI tape drives that is not generally
available via most vendors tape drivers. It issues raw
commands directly to the tape drive, using either the oper-
ating system s SCSI generic device ( e.g. /dev/sg0 on Linux,
/dev/pass0 on FreeBSD) or the raw SCSI I/O ioctl on a tape
device on some operat- ing systems.</p>

<p>One good time to use tapeinfo is immediately after a
tape i/o opera- tion has failed. On tape drives that support
HP s tapealert API, tapeinfo will report a more exact
description of what went wrong.</p>

<p>Do be aware that tapeinfo is not a substitute for your
operating sys- tem s own mt or similar tape driver control
program. It is intended to supplement, not replace, programs
like mt that access your operat- ing system s tape driver in
order to report or set information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The first argument, given following -f , is the
SCSI generic device corresponding to your tape drive.
Consult your operating systems doc- umentation for more
information (for example, under Linux these are generally
start at /dev/sg0 under FreeBSD these start at
/dev/pass0).</p>

<p>Under FreeBSD, camcontrol devlist will tell you what
SCSI devices you have, along with which pass device controls
them. Under Linux, &quot;cat /proc/scsi/scsi&quot; will tell
you what SCSI devices you have.</p>

<p>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS This program has only been tested
on Linux with a limited number of tape drives (HP DDS4,
Seagate AIT).</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY tapeinfo is currently being maintained by
Robert Nelson &lt;robertnel- son@users.sourceforge.net&gt;
as part of the mtx suite of programs. The mtx home page is
http://mtx.sourceforge.net and the actual code is currently
available there and via SVN from http://source-
forge.net/projects/mtx.</p>
