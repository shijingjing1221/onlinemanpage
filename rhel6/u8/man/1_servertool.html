<p>servertool(1) Java IDL and RMI-IIOP Tools
servertool(1)</p>

<p>NAME servertool - Provides an easy-to-use interface for
developers to register, unregister, start up, and shut down
a persistent server.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS servertool -ORBInitialPort nameserverport [
options ] [ commands ]</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>commands The command-line commands. See Commands.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The servertool command provides the
command-line interface for developers to register,
unregister, start up, and shut down a persistent server.
Command-line commands let you obtain various statistical
information about the server. See Commands.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -ORBInitialHost nameserverhost This options is
required. It specifies the host machine on which the name
server runs and listens for incoming requests. The
nameserverhost value must specify the port on which the orb
is running and listening for requests. The value defaults to
localhost when this option is not specified. If orbd and
servertool are running on different machines, then you must
specify the name or IP address of the host on which orbd is
running.</p>

<p>Note: On Oracle Solaris, you must become a root user to
start a process on a port below 1024. Oracle recommends that
you use a port number above or equal to 1024 for the
nameserverport value.</p>

<p>-Joption Passes option to the Java Virtual Machine,
where option is one of the options described on the
reference page for the Java application launcher. For
example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 MB. See
java(1).</p>

<p>COMMANDS You can start the servertool command with or
without a command-line command.</p>

<p>&middot; If you did not specify a command when you
started servertool, then the command-line tool displays the
servertool prompt where you can enter commands: servertool
&gt;.</p>

<p>&middot; If you specify a command when you start
servertool, then the Java IDL Server Tool starts, executes
the command, and exits.</p>

<p>register -server server-class-name -classpath
classpath-to- server [ -applicationName application-name
-args args-to-server -vmargs flags-for-JVM ] Registers a new
persistent server with the Object Request Broker Daemon
(ORBD). If the server is not already registered, then it is
registered and activated. This command causes an
installation method to be called in the main class of the
server identified by the -server option. The installation
method must be public static void
install(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The install method is optional
and lets developers provide their own server installation
behavior, such as creating a database schema.</p>

<p>unregister -serverid server-id | -applicationName
application-name Unregisters a server from the ORBD with
either its server ID or its application name. This command
causes an uninstallation method to be called in the main
class of the server identified by the -server option. The
uninstall method must be public static void
uninstall(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The uninstall method is
optional and lets developers provide their own server
uninstallation behavior, such as undoing the behavior of the
install method.</p>

<p>getserverid -applicationName application-name Returns
the server ID that corresponds to the application-name
value.</p>

<p>list Lists information about all persistent servers
registered with the ORBD.</p>

<p>listappnames Lists the application names for all servers
currently registered with the ORBD.</p>

<p>listactive Lists information about all persistent
servers that were started by the ORBD and are currently
running.</p>

<p>locate -serverid server-id | -applicationName
application-name [ -endpointType endpointType ] Locates the
endpoints (ports) of a specific type for all ORBs created by
a registered server. If a server is not already running,
then it is activated. If an endpointType value is not
specified, then the plain/non-protected endpoint associated
with each ORB in a server is returned.</p>

<p>locateperorb -serverid server-id | -applicationName
application-name [ -orbid ORB-name ] Locates all the
endpoints (ports) registered by a specific Object Request
Broker (ORB) of registered server. If a server is not
already running, then it is activated. If an orbid is not
specified, then the default value of &quot;&quot; is
assigned to the orbid. If any ORBs are created with an orbid
of empty string, then all ports registered by it are
returned.</p>

<p>orblist -serverid server-id | -applicationName
application-name Lists the ORBId of the ORBs defined on a
server. An ORBId is the string name for the ORB created by
the server. If the server is not already running, then it is
activated.</p>

<p>shutdown -serverid server-id | -applicationName
application-name Shut down an active server that is
registered with ORBD. During execution of this command, the
shutdown method defined in the class specified by either the
-serverid or -applicationName parameter is also called to
shut down the server process.</p>

<p>startup -serverid server-id | -applicationName
application-name Starts up or activate a server that is
registered with ORBD. If the server is not running, then
this command starts the server. If the server is already
running, then an error message is displayed.</p>

<p>help Lists all the commands available to the server
through the servertool command.</p>

<p>quit Exits the servertool command.</p>
