<p>NAME muttrc - Configuration file for the Mutt Mail User
Agent</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A mutt configuration file consists of a
series of commands. Each line of the file may contain one or
more commands. When multiple com- mands are used, they must
be separated by a semicolon (;).</p>

<p>The hash mark, or pound sign (#), is used as a comment
character. You can use it to annotate your initialization
file. All text after the comment character to the end of the
line is ignored.</p>

<p>Single quotes ) and double quotes (&quot;) can be used
to quote strings which contain spaces or other special
characters. The differ- ence between the two types of quotes
is similar to that of many popular shell programs, namely
that a single quote is used to specify a literal string (one
that is not interpreted for shell variables or quoting with
a backslash [see next paragraph]), while double quotes
indicate a string which should be evaluated. For example,
backticks are evaluated inside of double quotes, but not
single quotes.</p>

<p>quotes the next character, just as in shells such as
bash and zsh. For example, if want to put quotes (&quot;)
inside of a string, you can use to force the next character
to be a literal instead of inter- preted character.</p>

<p>r have \ means to insert a literal into the line. n and
their usual C meanings of linefeed and carriage-return,
respectively.</p>

<p>A at the end of a line can be used to split commands
over multiple lines, provided that the split points dont
appear in the middle of command names.</p>

<p>It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix
command in an initialization file. This is accomplished by
enclosing the command in backticks comman).</p>

<p>UNIX environment variables can be accessed like the way
it is done in shells like sh and bash: Prepend the name of
the variable by a dollar ) sign.</p>

<p>COMMANDS alias [-group name [...]] key address [,
address [ ... ]] unalias [ * | key ]</p>

<p>alias defines an alias key for the given addresses. Each
address will be resolved into either an email address
(user@example.com) or a named email address (User Name
&lt;user@example.com&gt;). The address may be specified in
either format, or in the format user@example.com (User
Name). unalias removes the alias cor- responding to the
given key or all aliases when * is used as an argument. The
optional -group argument to alias causes the aliased
address(es) to be added to the named group.</p>

<p>group [-group name] [-rx EXPR [ ... ]] [-addr address [
... ]] ungroup [-group name ] [ * | [[-rx EXPR [ ... ]]
[-addr address [ ... ]]]</p>

<p>group is used to directly add either addresses or
regular expressions to the specified group or groups. The
different cat- egories of arguments to the group command can
be in any order. The flags -rx and -addr specify what the
following strings (that cannot begin with a hyphen) should
be interpreted as: either a regular expression or an email
address, respectively. ungroup is used to remove addresses
or regular expressions from the specified group or groups.
The syntax is similar to the group command, however the
special character * can be used to empty a group of all of
its contents.</p>

<p>These address groups can also be created implicitly by
the alias, lists, subscribe and alternates commands by
specifying the optional -group option.</p>

<p>Once defined, these address groups can be used in
patterns to search for and limit the display to messages
matching a group.</p>

<p>alternates [-group name] regexp [ , regexp [ ... ]]
unalternates [ * | regexp [ , regexp [ ... ]] ]</p>

<p>alternates is used to inform mutt about alternate
addresses where you receive mail; you can use regular
expressions to spec- ify alternate addresses. This affects
mutts idea about mes- sages from you, and messages addressed
to you. unalternates removes a regular expression from the
list of known alternates. The -group flag causes all of the
subsequent regular expressions to be added to the named
group.</p>

<p>alternative_order type[/subtype] [ ... ]
unalternative_order [ * | type/subtype] [...]</p>

<p>alternative_order command permits you to define an order
of preference which is used by mutt to determine which part
of a multipart/alternative body to display. A subtype of *
matches any subtype, as does an empty subtype.
unalternative_order removes entries from the ordered list or
deletes the entire list when * is used as an argument.</p>

<p>auto_view type[/subtype] [ ... ] unauto_view
type[/subtype] [ ... ]</p>

<p>This commands permits you to specify that mutt should
automati- cally convert the given MIME types to text/plain
when displaying messages. For this to work, there must be a
mailcap(5) entry for the given MIME type with the
copiousoutput flag set. A sub- type of * matches any
subtype, as does an empty subtype.</p>

<p>mime_lookup type[/subtype] [ ... ] unmime_lookup
type[/subtype] [ ... ]</p>

<p>This command permits you to define a list of
&quot;data&quot; MIME content types for which mutt will try
to determine the actual file type from the file name, and
not use a mailcap(5) entry given for the original MIME type.
For instance, you may add the applica- tion/octet-stream
MIME type to this list.</p>

<p>bind map1,map2,... key function This command binds the
given key for the given map or maps to the given function.
Multiple maps may be specified by separating them with
commas (no whitespace is allowed).</p>

<p>Valid maps are: generic, alias, attach, browser, editor,
index, compose, pager, pgp, postpone, mix.</p>

<p>For more information on keys and functions, please
consult the Mutt Manual. Note that the function name is to
be specified without angle brackets.</p>

<p>account-hook [!]regexp command This hook is executed
whenever you access a remote mailbox. Use- ful to adjust
configuration settings to different IMAP or POP servers.</p>

<p>charset-hook alias charset This command defines an alias
for a character set. This is use- ful to properly display
messages which are tagged with a charac- ter set name not
known to mutt.</p>

<p>iconv-hook charset local-charset This command defines a
system-specific name for a character set. This is useful
when your system s iconv(3) implementation does not
understand MIME character set names (such as iso-8859-1),
but instead insists on being fed with
implementation-specific character set names (such as
8859-1). In this specific case, youd put this into your
configuration file:</p>

<p>iconv-hook iso-8859-1 8859-1</p>

<p>message-hook [!]pattern command Before mutt displays (or
formats for replying or forwarding) a message which matches
the given pattern (or, when it is preceded by an exclamation
mark, does not match the pattern), the given command is
executed. When multiple message-hooks match, they are
executed in the order in which they occur in the configu-
ration file.</p>

<p>folder-hook [!]regexp command When mutt enters a folder
which matches regexp (or, when regexp is preceded by an
exclamation mark, does not match regexp), the given command
is executed.</p>

<p>When several folder-hooks match a given mail folder,
they are executed in the order given in the configuration
file.</p>

<p>macro map key sequence [ description ] This command
binds the given sequence of keys to the given key in the
given map or maps. For valid maps, see bind. To specify
multiple maps, put only a comma between the maps.</p>

<p>color object foreground background [ regexp ] color
index foreground background [ pattern ] uncolor index
pattern [ pattern ... ]</p>

<p>If your terminal supports color, these commands can be
used to assign foreground/background combinations to certain
objects. Valid objects are: attachment, body, bold, header,
hdrdefault, index, indicator, markers, message, normal,
quoted, quotedN, search, signature, status, tilde, tree,
underline. The body and header objects allow you to restrict
the colorization to a regu- lar expression. The index object
permits you to select colored messages by pattern.</p>

<p>Valid colors include: white, black, green, magenta,
blue, cyan, yellow, red, default, colorN.</p>

<p>mono object attribute [ regexp ] mono index attribute [
pattern ]</p>

<p>For terminals which dont support color, you can still
assign attributes to objects. Valid attributes include:
none, bold, underline, reverse, and standout.</p>

<p>[un]ignore pattern [ pattern ... ] The ignore command
permits you to specify header fields which you usually don t
wish to see. Any header field whose tag begins with an
ignored pattern will be ignored.</p>

<p>The unignore command permits you to define exceptions
from the above mentioned list of ignored headers.</p>

<p>lists [-group name] regexp [ regexp ... ] unlists regexp
[ regexp ... ] subscribe [-group name] regexp [ regexp ... ]
unsubscribe regexp [ regexp ... ]</p>

<p>Mutt maintains two lists of mailing list address
patterns, a list of subscribed mailing lists, and a list of
known mailing lists. All subscribed mailing lists are known.
Patterns use regular expressions.</p>

<p>The lists command adds a mailing list address to the
list of known mailing lists. The unlists command removes a
mailing list from the lists of known and subscribed mailing
lists. The sub- scribe command adds a mailing list to the
lists of known and subscribed mailing lists. The unsubscribe
command removes it from the list of subscribed mailing
lists. The -group flag adds all of the subsequent regular
expressions to the named group.</p>

<p>mbox-hook [!]pattern mailbox When mutt changes to a mail
folder which matches pattern, mail- box will be used as the
mbox folder, i.e., read messages will be moved to that
folder when the mail folder is left.</p>

<p>The first matching mbox-hook applies.</p>

<p>mailboxes filename [ filename ... ] unmailboxes [ * |
filename ... ]</p>

<p>The mailboxes specifies folders which can receive mail
and which will be checked for new messages. When changing
folders, press- ing space will cycle through folders with
new mail. The unmail- boxes command is used to remove a file
name from the list of folders which can receive mail. If
&quot;*&quot; is specified as the file name, the list is
emptied.</p>

<p>my_hdr string unmy_hdr field</p>

<p>Using my_hdr, you can define headers which will be added
to the messages you compose. unmy_hdr will remove the given
user- defined headers.</p>

<p>hdr_order header1 header2 [ ... ] With this command, you
can specify an order in which mutt will attempt to present
headers to you when viewing messages.</p>

<p>save-hook [!]pattern filename When a message matches
pattern, the default file name when sav- ing it will be the
given filename.</p>

<p>fcc-hook [!]pattern filename When an outgoing message
matches pattern, the default file name for storing a copy
(fcc) will be the given filename.</p>

<p>fcc-save-hook [!]pattern filename This command is an
abbreviation for identical fcc-hook and save- hook
commands.</p>

<p>send-hook [!]pattern command When composing a message
matching pattern, command is executed. When multiple
send-hooks match, they are executed in the order in which
they occur in the configuration file.</p>

<p>send2-hook [!]pattern command Whenever a message
matching pattern is changed (either by edit- ing it or by
using the compose menu), command is executed. When multiple
send2-hooks match, they are executed in the order in which
they occur in the configuration file. Possible applica-
tions include setting the $sendmail variable when a messages
from header is changed.</p>

<p>send2-hook execution is not triggered by use of
enter-command from the compose menu.</p>

<p>reply-hook [!]pattern command When replying to a message
matching pattern, command is exe- cuted. When multiple
reply-hooks match, they are executed in the order in which
they occur in the configuration file, but all reply-hooks
are matched and executed before send-hooks, regard- less of
their order in the configuration file.</p>

<p>crypt-hook pattern key-id The crypt-hook command
provides a method by which you can spec- ify the ID of the
public key to be used when encrypting messages to a certain
recipient. The meaning of &quot;key ID&quot; is to be taken
broadly: This can be a different e-mail address, a numerical
key ID, or even just an arbitrary search string.</p>

<p>push string This command adds the named string to the
keyboard buffer.</p>

<p>set [no|inv|&amp;|?]variable[=value] [ ... ] toggle
variable [ ... ] unset variable [ ... ] reset variable [ ...
]</p>

<p>These commands are used to set and manipulate
configuration variables.</p>

<p>Mutt knows four basic types of variables: boolean,
number, string and quadoption. Boolean variables can be set
(true), unset (false), or toggled. Number variables can be
assigned a positive integer value.</p>

<p>String variables consist of any number of printable
characters. Strings must be enclosed in quotes if they
contain spaces or tabs. You may also use the C escape
sequences n ant for newline and tab, respectively.</p>

<p>Quadoption variables are used to control whether or not
to be prompted for certain actions, or to specify a default
action. A value of yes will cause the action to be carried
out automati- cally as if you had answered yes to the
question. Similarly, a value of no will cause the the action
to be carried out as if you had answered no. A value of
ask-yes will cause a prompt with a default answer of yes and
ask-no will provide a default answer of no.</p>

<p>The reset command resets all given variables to the
compile time defaults. If you reset the special variable
all, all variables will reset to their compile time
defaults.</p>

<p>source filename The given file will be evaluated as a
configuration file.</p>

<p>spam pattern format nospam pattern These commands define
spam-detection patterns from external spam filters, so that
mutt can sort, limit, and search on spam tags or spam
attributes, or display them in the index. See the Mutt
manual for details.</p>

<p>unhook [ * | hook-type ] This command will remove all
hooks of a given type, or all hooks when * is used as an
argument. hook-type can be any of the -hook commands
documented above.</p>

<p>PATTERNS In various places with mutt, including some of
the above mentioned hook commands, you can specify patterns
to match messages.</p>

<p>Constructing Patterns A simple pattern consists of an
operator of the form ~character, pos- sibly followed by a
parameter against which mutt is supposed to match the object
specified by this operator. For some characters, the ~ may
be replaced by another character to alter the behavior of
the match. These are described in the list of operators,
below.</p>

<p>With some of these operators, the object to be matched
consists of sev- eral e-mail addresses. In these cases, the
object is matched if at least one of these e-mail addresses
matches. You can prepend a hat (^) character to such a
pattern to indicate that all addresses must match in order
to match the object.</p>

<p>You can construct complex patterns by combining simple
patterns with logical operators. Logical AND is specified by
simply concatenating two simple patterns, for instance ~C
mutt-dev ~s bug. Logical OR is specified by inserting a
vertical bar ( | ) between two patterns, for instance ~C
mutt-dev | ~s bug. Additionally, you can negate a pat- tern
by prepending a bang ( ! ) character. For logical grouping,
use braces (()). Example: !(~t mutt|~c mutt) ~f elkins.</p>

<p>Simple Patterns Mutt understands the following simple
patterns:</p>

<p>~A all messages ~b EXPR messages which contain EXPR in
the message body. =b STRING messages which contain STRING in
the message body. If IMAP is enabled, searches for STRING on
the server, rather than downloading each message and
searching it locally. ~B EXPR messages which contain EXPR in
the whole message. ~c EXPR messages carbon-copied to EXPR %c
GROUP messages carbon-copied to any member of GROUP ~C EXPR
messages either to: or cc: EXPR %C GROUP messages either to:
or cc: to any member of GROUP ~d MIN-MAX messages with
date-sent in a Date range ~D deleted messages ~e EXPR
messages which contain EXPR in the Sender field %e GROUP
messages which contain a member of GROUP in the Sender field
~E expired messages ~f EXPR messages originating from EXPR
%f GROUP messages originating form any member of GROUP ~F
flagged messages ~g PGP signed messages ~G PGP encrypted
messages ~h EXPR messages which contain EXPR in the message
header ~H EXPR messages with spam tags matching EXPR ~i EXPR
messages which match EXPR in the Message-ID field ~k
messages containing PGP key material ~l messages addressed
to a known mailing list (defined by either subscribe or
list) ~L EXPR messages either originated or received by EXPR
%L GROUP messages either originated or received by any
member of GROUP ~m MIN-MAX message in the range MIN to MAX
~n MIN-MAX messages with a score in the range MIN to MAX ~N
new messages ~O old messages ~p messages addressed to you
(as defined by alternates) ~P messages from you (as defined
by alternates) ~Q messages which have been replied to ~r
MIN-MAX messages with date-received in a Date range ~R read
messages ~s EXPR messages having EXPR in the Subject field.
~S superseded messages ~t EXPR messages addressed to EXPR ~T
tagged messages ~u messages addressed to a subscribed
mailing list (defined by subscribe commands) ~U unread
messages ~v message is part of a collapsed thread. ~V
cryptographically verified messages ~x EXPR messages which
contain EXPR in the References or In- Reply-To field ~X
MIN-MAX messages with MIN - MAX attachments ~y EXPR messages
which contain EXPR in the X-Label field ~z MIN-MAX messages
with a size in the range MIN to MAX ~= duplicated messages
(see $duplicate_threads) ~$ unreferenced message (requires
threaded view) ~(PATTERN) messages in threads containing
messages matching a certain pattern, e.g. all threads
containing messages from you: ~(~P)</p>

<p>In the above, EXPR is a regular expression.</p>

<p>With the ~d, ~m, ~n, ~r, ~X, and ~z operators, you can
also specify ranges in the forms &lt;MAX, &gt;MIN, MIN-, and
-MAX.</p>

<p>With the ~z operator, the suffixes K and M are allowed
to specify kilobyte and megabyte respectively.</p>

<p>Matching dates The ~d and ~r operators are used to match
date ranges, which are inter- preted to be given in your
local time zone.</p>

<p>A date is of the form DD[/MM[/[cc]YY]], that is, a
two-digit date, optionally followed by a two-digit month,
optionally followed by a year specifications. Omitted fields
default to the current month and year.</p>

<p>Mutt understands either two or four digit year
specifications. When given a two-digit year, mutt will
interpret values less than 70 as lying in the 21st century
(i.e., 38 means 2038 and not 1938, and 00 is interpreted as
2000), and values greater than or equal to 70 as lying in
the 20th century.</p>

<p>Note that this behavior is Y2K compliant, but that mutt
does have a Y2.07K problem.</p>

<p>If a date range consists of a single date, the operator
in question will match that precise date. If the date range
consists of a dash ( - ), followed by a date, this range
will match any date before and up to the date given.
Similarly, a date followed by a dash matches the date given
and any later point of time. Two dates, separated by a dash,
match any date which lies in the given range of time.</p>

<p>You can also modify any absolute date by giving an error
range. An error range consists of one of the characters +,
-, *, followed by a positive number, followed by one of the
unit characters y, m, w, or d, specifying a unit of years,
months, weeks, or days. + increases the maximum date matched
by the given interval of time, - decreases the minimum date
matched by the given interval of time, and * increases the
maximum date and decreases the minimum date matched by the
given inter- val of time. It is possible to give multiple
error margins, which cumulate. Example:
1/1/2001-1w+2w*3d</p>

<p>You can also specify offsets relative to the current
date. An offset is specified as one of the characters &lt;,
&gt;, =, followed by a positive number, followed by one of
the unit characters y, m, w, or d. &gt; matches dates which
are older than the specified amount of time, an offset which
begins with the character &lt; matches dates which are more
recent than the specified amount of time, and an offset
which begins with the character = matches points of time
which are precisely the given amount of time ago.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES abort_nosubject Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>If set to yes, when composing messages and no subject is
given at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted. If
set to no, composing messages with no subject given at the
subject prompt will never be aborted.</p>

<p>abort_unmodified Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>If set to yes, composition will automatically abort
after edit- ing the message body if no changes are made to
the file (this check only happens after the first edit of
the file). When set to no, composition will never be
aborted.</p>

<p>alias_file Type: path Default: ~/.muttrc</p>

<p>The default file in which to save aliases created by the
&lt;cre- ate-alias&gt; function. Entries added to this file
are encoded in the character set specified by
$config_charset if it is set or the current character set
otherwise.</p>

<p>Note: Mutt will not automatically source this file; you
must explicitly use the source command for it to be executed
in case this option points to a dedicated alias file.</p>

<p>The default for this option is the currently used muttrc
file, or ~/.muttrc if no user muttrc was found.</p>

<p>alias_format Type: string Default: %4n %2f %t %-10a
%r</p>

<p>Specifies the format of the data displayed for the alias
menu. The following printf(3)-style sequences are available:
%a alias name %f flags - currently, a d for an alias marked
for deletion %n index number %r address which alias expands
to %t character which indicates if the alias is tagged for
inclusion</p>

<p>allow_8bit Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using
either Quoted- Printable or Base64 encoding when sending
mail.</p>

<p>allow_ansi Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color
tags in rich text messages) are to be interpreted. Messages
containing these codes are rare, but if this option is set,
their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may
override your color choices, and even present a security
problem, since a message could include a line like</p>

<p>[-- PGP output follows ...</p>

<p>and give it the same color as your attachment color (see
also $crypt_timestamp).</p>

<p>arrow_cursor Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, an arrow (-&gt;) will be used to indicate the
current entry in menus instead of highlighting the whole
line. On slow network or modem links this will make response
faster because there is less that has to be redrawn on the
screen when moving to the next or previous entries in the
menu.</p>

<p>ascii_chars Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will use plain ASCII characters when
displaying thread and attachment trees, instead of the
default ACS charac- ters.</p>

<p>askbcc Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc)
recipi- ents before editing an outgoing message.</p>

<p>askcc Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will prompt you for carbon-copy (Cc)
recipients before editing the body of an outgoing
message.</p>

<p>assumed_charset Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This variable is a colon-separated list of character
encoding schemes for messages without character encoding
indication. Header field values and message body content
without character encoding indication would be assumed that
they are written in one of this list. By default, all the
header fields and message body without any charset
indication are assumed to be in us-ascii.</p>

<p>For example, Japanese users might prefer this:</p>

<p>set assumed_charset=
iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8</p>

<p>However, only the first content is valid for the message
body.</p>

<p>attach_charset Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This variable is a colon-separated list of character
encoding schemes for text file attachments. Mutt uses this
setting to guess which encoding files being attached are
encoded in to con- vert them to a proper character set given
in $send_charset.</p>

<p>If unset, the value of $charset will be used instead.
For exam- ple, the following configuration would work for
Japanese text handling:</p>

<p>set attach_charset=
iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8</p>

<p>Note: for Japanese users, iso-2022-* must be put at the
head of the value as shown above if included.</p>

<p>attach_format Type: string Default: %u%D%I %t%4n
%T%.40d%&gt; [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s]</p>

<p>This variable describes the format of the attachment
menu. The following printf(3)-style sequences are
understood: %C charset %c requires charset conversion (n or
c) %D deleted flag %d description %e MIME
content-transfer-encoding %f filename %I disposition (I for
inline, A for attachment) %m major MIME type %M MIME subtype
%n attachment number %Q Q , if MIME part qualifies for
attachment counting %s size %t tagged flag %T graphic tree
characters %u unlink (=to delete) flag %X number of
qualifying MIME parts in this part and its children (please
see the attachments section for possi- ble speed effects)
%&gt;X right justify the rest of the string and pad with
charac- ter X %|X pad to the end of the line with character
X %*X soft-fill with character X as pad</p>

<p>For an explanation of soft-fill , see the $index_format
docu- mentation.</p>

<p>attach_sep Type: string Default: 0 The separator to add
between attachments when operating (saving, printing,
piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.</p>

<p>attach_split Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If this variable is unset, when operating (saving,
printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt
will concate- nate the attachments and will operate on them
as a single attachment. The $attach_sep separator is added
after each attachment. When set, Mutt will operate on the
attachments one by one.</p>

<p>attribution Type: string Default: On %d, %n wrote:</p>

<p>This is the string that will precede a message which has
been included in a reply. For a full listing of defined
printf(3)-like sequences see the section on
$index_format.</p>

<p>auto_tag Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, functions in the index menu which affect a
message will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are
any). When unset, you must first use the &lt;tag-prefix&gt;
function (bound to ; by default) to make the next function
apply to all tagged messages.</p>

<p>autoedit Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set along with $edit_headers, Mutt will skip the
initial send-menu (prompting for subject and recipients) and
allow you to immediately begin editing the body of your
message. The send-menu may still be accessed once you have
finished editing the body of your message.</p>

<p>Note: when this option is set, you cannot use send-hooks
that depend on the recipients when composing a new
(non-reply) mes- sage, as the initial list of recipients is
empty.</p>

<p>Also see $fast_reply.</p>

<p>beep Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error
occurs.</p>

<p>beep_new Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will beep whenever it
prints a message notifying you of new mail. This is
independent of the setting of the $beep variable.</p>

<p>bounce Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing
messages. If set to yes you dont get asked if you want to
bounce a mes- sage. Setting this variable to no is not
generally useful, and thus not recommended, because you are
unable to bounce messages.</p>

<p>bounce_delivered Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will include
Delivered-To head- ers when bouncing messages. Postfix users
may wish to unset this variable.</p>

<p>braille_friendly Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will place the cursor at
the beginning of the current line in menus, even when the
$arrow_cursor variable is unset, making it easier for blind
per- sons using Braille displays to follow these menus. The
option is unset by default because many visual terminals
dont permit making the cursor invisible.</p>

<p>certificate_file Type: path Default:
~/.mutt_certificates</p>

<p>This variable specifies the file where the certificates
you trust are saved. When an unknown certificate is
encountered, you are asked if you accept it or not. If you
accept it, the cer- tificate can also be saved in this file
and further connections are automatically accepted.</p>

<p>You can also manually add CA certificates in this file.
Any server certificate that is signed with one of these CA
certifi- cates is also automatically accepted.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>set certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates</p>

<p>charset Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Character set your terminal uses to display and enter
textual data. It is also the fallback for $send_charset.</p>

<p>Upon startup Mutt tries to derive this value from
environment variables such as $LC_CTYPE or $LANG.</p>

<p>Note: It should only be set in case Mutt isnt abled to
deter- mine the character set used correctly.</p>

<p>check_mbox_size Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When this variable is set, mutt will use file size
attribute instead of access time when checking for new mail
in mbox and mmdf folders.</p>

<p>This variable is unset by default and should only be
enabled when new mail detection for these folder types is
unreliable or doesnt work.</p>

<p>Note that enabling this variable should happen before
any mail- boxes directives occur in configuration files
regarding mbox or mmdf folders because mutt needs to
determine the initial new mail status of such a mailbox by
performing a fast mailbox scan when it is defined.
Afterwards the new mail status is tracked by file size
changes.</p>

<p>check_new Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Note: this option only affects maildir and MH style
mailboxes.</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while
the mail- box is open. Especially with MH mailboxes, this
operation can take quite some time since it involves
scanning the directory and checking each file to see if it
has already been looked at. If this variable is unset, no
check for new mail is performed while the mailbox is
open.</p>

<p>collapse_unread Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When unset, Mutt will not collapse a thread if it
contains any unread messages.</p>

<p>compose_format Type: string Default: -- Mutt: Compose
[Approx. msg size: %l Atts: %a]%&gt;-</p>

<p>Controls the format of the status line displayed in the
com- pose menu. This string is similar to $status_format,
but has its own set of printf(3)-like sequences: %a total
number of attachments %h local hostname %l approximate size
(in bytes) of the current message %v Mutt version string</p>

<p>See the text describing the $status_format option for
more information on how to set $compose_format.</p>

<p>config_charset Type: string Default:</p>

<p>When defined, Mutt will recode commands in rc files from
this encoding to the current character set as specified by
$charset and aliases written to $alias_file from the current
character set.</p>

<p>Please note that if setting $charset it must be done
before set- ting $config_charset.</p>

<p>Recoding should be avoided as it may render
unconvertable char- acters as question marks which can lead
to undesired side effects (for example in regular
expressions).</p>

<p>confirmappend Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when
appending mes- sages to an existing mailbox.</p>

<p>confirmcreate Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when saving
messages to a mailbox which does not yet exist before
creating it.</p>

<p>connect_timeout Type: number Default: 30</p>

<p>Causes Mutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP,
POP or SMTP) after this many seconds if the connection is
not able to be established. A negative value causes Mutt to
wait indefi- nitely for the connection attempt to
succeed.</p>

<p>content_type Type: string Default: text/plain</p>

<p>Sets the default Content-Type for the body of newly
composed messages.</p>

<p>copy Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable controls whether or not copies of your
outgoing messages will be saved for later references. Also
see $record, $save_name, $force_name and fcc-hook.</p>

<p>crypt_autoencrypt Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt
to PGP encrypt outgoing messages. This is probably only
useful in con- nection to the send-hook command. It can be
overridden by use of the pgp menu, when encryption is not
required or signing is requested as well. If
$smime_is_default is set, then OpenSSL is used instead to
create S/MIME messages and settings can be over- ridden by
use of the smime menu instead. (Crypto only)</p>

<p>crypt_autopgp Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable controls whether or not mutt may
automatically enable PGP encryption/signing for messages.
See also $crypt_autoencrypt, $crypt_replyencrypt,
$crypt_autosign, $crypt_replysign and $smime_is_default.</p>

<p>crypt_autosign Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt
to cryp- tographically sign outgoing messages. This can be
overridden by use of the pgp menu, when signing is not
required or encryption is requested as well. If
$smime_is_default is set, then OpenSSL is used instead to
create S/MIME messages and settings can be overridden by use
of the smime menu instead of the pgp menu. (Crypto only)</p>

<p>crypt_autosmime Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable controls whether or not mutt may
automatically enable S/MIME encryption/signing for messages.
See also $crypt_autoencrypt, $crypt_replyencrypt,
$crypt_autosign, $crypt_replysign and $smime_is_default.</p>

<p>crypt_replyencrypt Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL encrypt replies to
messages which are encrypted. (Crypto only)</p>

<p>crypt_replysign Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to
messages which are signed.</p>

<p>Note: this does not work on messages that are encrypted
and signed! (Crypto only)</p>

<p>crypt_replysignencrypted Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to
messages which are encrypted. This makes sense in
combination with $crypt_replyencrypt, because it allows you
to sign all messages which are automatically encrypted. This
works around the prob- lem noted in $crypt_replysign, that
mutt is not able to find out whether an encrypted message is
also signed. (Crypto only)</p>

<p>crypt_timestamp Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, mutt will include a time stamp in the lines
surrounding PGP or S/MIME output, so spoofing such lines is
more difficult. If you are using colors to mark these lines,
and rely on these, you may unset this setting. (Crypto
only)</p>

<p>crypt_use_gpgme Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This variable controls the use of the GPGME-enabled
crypto back- ends. If it is set and Mutt was built with
gpgme support, the gpgme code for S/MIME and PGP will be
used instead of the clas- sic code. Note that you need to
set this option in .muttrc; it wont have any effect when
used interactively.</p>

<p>crypt_use_pka Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Controls whether mutt uses PKA (see
http://www.g10code.de/docs/pka-intro.de.pdf) during
signature verification (only supported by the GPGME
backend).</p>

<p>crypt_verify_sig Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>If _yes_, always attempt to verify PGP or S/MIME
signatures. If ask-*, ask whether or not to verify the
signature. If no , never attempt to verify cryptographic
signatures. (Crypto only)</p>

<p>date_format Type: string Default: !%a, %b %d, %Y at
%I:%M:%S%p %Z</p>

<p>This variable controls the format of the date printed by
the %d sequence in $index_format. This is passed to the
strftime(3) function to process the date, see the man page
for the proper syntax.</p>

<p>Unless the first character in the string is a bang (!),
the month and week day names are expanded according to the
locale specified in the variable $locale. If the first
character in the string is a bang, the bang is discarded,
and the month and week day names in the rest of the string
are expanded in the C locale (that is in US English).</p>

<p>default_hook Type: string Default: ~f %s !~P | (~P ~C
%s)</p>

<p>This variable controls how message-hook , reply-hook,
send- hook , send2-hook, save-hook, and fcc-hook will be
inter- preted if they are specified with only a simple
regexp, instead of a matching pattern. The hooks are
expanded when they are declared, so a hook will be
interpreted according to the value of this variable at the
time the hook is declared.</p>

<p>The default value matches if the message is either from
a user matching the regular expression given, or if it is
from you (if the from address matches alternates) and is to
or cced to a user matching the given regular expression.</p>

<p>delete Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>Controls whether or not messages are really deleted when
closing or synchronizing a mailbox. If set to yes, messages
marked for deleting will automatically be purged without
prompting. If set to no, messages marked for deletion will
be kept in the mailbox.</p>

<p>delete_untag Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If this option is set, mutt will untag messages when
marking them for deletion. This applies when you either
explicitly delete a message, or when you save it to another
folder.</p>

<p>digest_collapse Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If this option is set, mutt s received-attachments menu
will not show the subparts of individual messages in a
multipart/digest. To see these subparts, press v on that
menu.</p>

<p>display_filter Type: path Default:</p>

<p>When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.
When a message is viewed it is passed as standard input to
$dis- play_filter, and the filtered message is read from the
standard output.</p>

<p>dsn_notify Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This variable sets the request for when notification is
returned. The string consists of a comma separated list (no
spaces!) of one or more of the following: never, to never
request notification, failure, to request notification on
trans- mission failure, delay, to be notified of message
delays, suc- cess, to be notified of successful
transmission.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>set dsn_notify=failure,delay</p>

<p>Note: when using $sendmail for delivery, you should not
enable this unless you are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or
greater or a MTA providing a sendmail(1)-compatible
interface supporting the -N option for DSN. For SMTP
delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it depends on
the server whether DSN will be used or not.</p>

<p>dsn_return Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This variable controls how much of your message is
returned in DSN messages. It may be set to either hdrs to
return just the message header, or full to return the full
message.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>set dsn_return=hdrs</p>

<p>Note: when using $sendmail for delivery, you should not
enable this unless you are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or
greater or a MTA providing a sendmail(1)-compatible
interface supporting the -R option for DSN. For SMTP
delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it depends on
the server whether DSN will be used or not.</p>

<p>duplicate_threads Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable controls whether mutt, when $sort is set
to threads, threads messages with the same Message-Id
together. If it is set, it will indicate that it thinks they
are duplicates of each other with an equals sign in the
thread tree.</p>

<p>edit_headers Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This option allows you to edit the header of your
outgoing mes- sages along with the body of your message.</p>

<p>Note that changes made to the References: and Date:
headers are ignored for interoperability reasons.</p>

<p>editor Type: path Default:</p>

<p>This variable specifies which editor is used by mutt. It
defaults to the value of the $VISUAL, or $EDITOR,
environment variable, or to the string vi if neither of
those are set.</p>

<p>encode_from Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will quoted-printable encode messages
when they contain the string From (note the trailing space)
in the beginning of a line. This is useful to avoid the
tampering cer- tain mail delivery and transport agents tend
to do with messages (in order to prevent tools from
misinterpreting the line as a mbox message separator).</p>

<p>envelope_from_address Type: e-mail address Default:</p>

<p>Manually sets the envelope sender for outgoing messages.
This value is ignored if $use_envelope_from is unset.</p>

<p>escape Type: string Default: ~</p>

<p>Escape character to use for functions in the built-in
editor.</p>

<p>fast_reply Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject
are skipped when replying to messages, and the initial
prompt for subject is skipped when forwarding messages.</p>

<p>Note: this variable has no effect when the $autoedit
variable is set.</p>

<p>fcc_attach Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable controls whether or not attachments on
outgoing messages are saved along with the main body of your
message.</p>

<p>fcc_clear Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored
unencrypted and unsigned, even when the actual message is
encrypted and/or signed. (PGP only)</p>

<p>folder Type: path Default: ~/Mail</p>

<p>Specifies the default location of your mailboxes. A + or
= at the beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the
value of this variable. Note that if you change this
variable (from the default) value you need to make sure that
the assignment occurs before you use + or = for any other
variables since expan- sion takes place when handling the
mailboxes command.</p>

<p>folder_format Type: string Default: %2C %t %N %F %2l
%-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f</p>

<p>This variable allows you to customize the file browser
display to your personal taste. This string is similar to
$index_for- mat, but has its own set of printf(3)-like
sequences: %C current file number %d date/time folder was
last modified %f filename (/ is appended to directory names,
@ to sym- bolic links and * to executable files) %F file
permissions %g group name (or numeric gid, if missing) %l
number of hard links %N N if folder has new mail, blank
otherwise %s size in bytes %t * if the file is tagged, blank
otherwise %u owner name (or numeric uid, if missing) %&gt;X
right justify the rest of the string and pad with charac-
ter X %|X pad to the end of the line with character X %*X
soft-fill with character X as pad</p>

<p>For an explanation of soft-fill , see the $index_format
docu- mentation.</p>

<p>followup_to Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls whether or not the Mail-Followup-To: header
field is generated when sending mail. When set, Mutt will
generate this field when you are replying to a known mailing
list, specified with the subscribe or lists commands.</p>

<p>This field has two purposes. First, preventing you from
receiv- ing duplicate copies of replies to messages which
you send to mailing lists, and second, ensuring that you do
get a reply sep- arately for any messages sent to known
lists to which you are not subscribed.</p>

<p>The header will contain only the lists address for
subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own
email address for unsubscribed lists. Without this header, a
group reply to your message sent to a subscribed list will
be sent to both the list and your address, resulting in two
copies of the same email for you.</p>

<p>force_name Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This variable is similar to $save_name, except that Mutt
will store a copy of your outgoing message by the username
of the address you are sending to even if that mailbox does
not exist.</p>

<p>Also see the $record variable.</p>

<p>forward_decode Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into
text/plain when forwarding a message. The message header is
also RFC2047 decoded. This variable is only used, if
$mime_forward is unset, otherwise $mime_forward_decode is
used instead.</p>

<p>forward_decrypt Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls the handling of encrypted messages when
forwarding a message. When set, the outer layer of
encryption is stripped off. This variable is only used if
$mime_forward is set and $mime_forward_decode is unset. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>forward_edit Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>This quadoption controls whether or not the user is
automati- cally placed in the editor when forwarding
messages. For those who always want to forward with no
modification, use a setting of no.</p>

<p>forward_format Type: string Default: [%a: %s]</p>

<p>This variable controls the default subject when
forwarding a message. It uses the same format sequences as
the $index_format variable.</p>

<p>forward_quote Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, forwarded messages included in the main body
of the message (when $mime_forward is unset) will be quoted
using $indent_string.</p>

<p>from Type: e-mail address Default:</p>

<p>When set, this variable contains a default from address.
It can be overridden using my_hdr (including from a
send-hook) and $reverse_name. This variable is ignored if
$use_from is unset.</p>

<p>This setting defaults to the contents of the environment
vari- able $EMAIL.</p>

<p>gecos_mask Type: regular expression Default: ^[^,]*</p>

<p>A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS
field of a password entry when expanding the alias. The
default value will return the string up to the first ,
encountered. If the GECOS field contains a string like
lastname, firstname then you should set it to .*.</p>

<p>This can be useful if you see the following behavior:
you address an e-mail to user ID stevef whose full name is
Steve Franklin. If mutt expands stevef to Franklin
stevef@foo.bar then you should set the $gecos_mask to a
regular expression that will match the whole name so mutt
will expand Franklin to Franklin, Steve.</p>

<p>hdrs Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When unset, the header fields normally added by the
my_hdr command are not created. This variable must be unset
before composing a new message or replying in order to take
effect. If set, the user defined header fields are added to
every new mes- sage.</p>

<p>header Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, this variable causes Mutt to include the
header of the message you are replying to into the edit
buffer. The $weed setting applies.</p>

<p>header_cache Type: path Default:</p>

<p>This variable points to the header cache database. If
pointing to a directory Mutt will contain a header cache
database file per folder, if pointing to a file that file
will be a single global header cache. By default it is unset
so no header caching will be used.</p>

<p>Header caching can greatly improve speed when opening
POP, IMAP MH or Maildir folders, see caching for
details.</p>

<p>header_cache_compress Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When mutt is compiled with qdbm or tokyocabinet as
header cache backend, this option determines whether the
database will be compressed. Compression results in database
files roughly being one fifth of the usual diskspace, but
the decompression can result in a slower opening of cached
folder(s) which in general is still much faster than opening
non header cached folders.</p>

<p>help Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, help lines describing the bindings for the
major func- tions provided by each menu are displayed on the
first line of the screen.</p>

<p>Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
func- tion is bound to a sequence rather than a single
keystroke. Also, the help line may not be updated if a
binding is changed while Mutt is running. Since this
variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither of these
should present a major problem.</p>

<p>hidden_host Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will skip the host name part of $hostname
vari- able when adding the domain part to addresses. This
variable does not affect the generation of Message-IDs, and
it will not lead to the cut-off of first-level domains.</p>

<p>hide_limited Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages
that are hidden by limiting, in the thread tree.</p>

<p>hide_missing Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing
messages in the thread tree.</p>

<p>hide_thread_subject Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will not show the subject of messages in
the thread tree that have the same subject as their parent
or clos- est previously displayed sibling.</p>

<p>hide_top_limited Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages
that are hidden by limiting, at the top of threads in the
thread tree. Note that when $hide_limited is set, this
option will have no effect.</p>

<p>hide_top_missing Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing
messages at the top of threads in the thread tree. Note that
when $hide_missing is set, this option will have no
effect.</p>

<p>history Type: number Default: 10</p>

<p>This variable controls the size (in number of strings
remem- bered) of the string history buffer per category. The
buffer is cleared each time the variable is set.</p>

<p>history_file Type: path Default: ~/.mutthistory</p>

<p>The file in which Mutt will save its history.</p>

<p>honor_disposition Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will not display attachments with a
disposition of attachment inline even if it could render the
part to plain text. These MIME parts can only be viewed from
the attachment menu.</p>

<p>If unset, Mutt will render all MIME parts it can
properly trans- form to plain text.</p>

<p>honor_followup_to Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To
header is honored when group-replying to a message.</p>

<p>hostname Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Specifies the fully-qualified hostname of the system
mutt is running on containing the hosts name and the DNS
domain it belongs to. It is used as the domain part (after
@) for local email addresses as well as Message-Id
headers.</p>

<p>Its value is determined at startup as follows: If the
nodes name as returned by the uname(3) function contains the
hostname and the domain, these are used to construct
$hostname. If there is no domain part returned, Mutt will
look for a domain or search line in /etc/resolv.conf to
determine the domain. Optionally, Mutt can be compiled with
a fixed domain name in which case a detected one is not
used.</p>

<p>Also see $use_domain and $hidden_host.</p>

<p>ignore_linear_white_space Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This option replaces linear-white-space between
encoded-word and text to a single space to prevent the
display of MIME-encoded Subject: field from being divided
into multiple lines.</p>

<p>ignore_list_reply_to Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Affects the behavior of the &lt;reply&gt; function when
replying to messages from mailing lists (as defined by the
subscribe or lists commands). When set, if the Reply-To:
field is set to the same value as the To: field, Mutt
assumes that the Reply-To: field was set by the mailing list
to automate responses to the list, and will ignore this
field. To direct a response to the mailing list when this
option is set, use the &lt;list-reply&gt; function;
&lt;group-reply&gt; will reply to both the sender and the
list.</p>

<p>imap_authenticators Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods
mutt may attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the
order mutt should try them. Authentication methods are
either login or the right side of an IMAP AUTH=xxx
capability string, e.g. digest-md5 , gssapi or cram-md5.
This option is case-insen- sitive. If its unset (the
default) mutt will try all available methods, in order from
most-secure to least-secure.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>set imap_authenticators=gssapi:cram-md5:login</p>

<p>Note: Mutt will only fall back to other authentication
methods if the previous methods are unavailable. If a method
is avail- able but authentication fails, mutt will not
connect to the IMAP server.</p>

<p>imap_check_subscribed Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will fetch the set of subscribed folders
from your server on connection, and add them to the set of
mailboxes it polls for new mail just as if you had issued
individual mailboxes commands.</p>

<p>imap_delim_chars Type: string Default: /.</p>

<p>This contains the list of characters which you would
like to treat as folder separators for displaying IMAP
paths. In partic- ular it helps in using the = shortcut for
your folder vari- able.</p>

<p>imap_headers Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Mutt requests these header fields in addition to the
default headers (Date:, From:, Subject:, To: , Cc: , Mes-
sage-Id: , References: , Content-Type: , Content-Descrip-
tion:, In-Reply-To: , Reply-To: , Lines: , List-Post:,
X-Label: ) from IMAP servers before displaying the index
menu. You may want to add more headers for spam
detection.</p>

<p>Note: This is a space separated list, items should be
uppercase and not contain the colon, e.g. X-BOGOSITY
X-SPAM-STATUS for the X-Bogosity: and X-Spam-Status: header
fields.</p>

<p>imap_idle Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will attempt to use the IMAP IDLE
extension to check for new mail in the current mailbox. Some
servers (dovecot was the inspiration for this option) react
badly to mutts implementation. If your connection seems to
freeze up periodi- cally, try unsetting this.</p>

<p>imap_keepalive Type: number Default: 900</p>

<p>This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in
seconds that mutt will wait before polling open IMAP
connections, to prevent the server from closing them before
mutt has finished with them. The default is well within the
RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before a
server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does
get violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you
find yourself getting discon- nected from your IMAP server
due to inactivity.</p>

<p>imap_list_subscribed Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing
will look for only subscribed folders or all folders. This
can be toggled in the IMAP browser with the
&lt;toggle-subscribed&gt; function.</p>

<p>imap_login Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Your login name on the IMAP server.</p>

<p>This variable defaults to the value of $imap_user.</p>

<p>imap_pass Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Specifies the password for your IMAP account. If unset,
Mutt will prompt you for your password when you invoke the
&lt;imap-fetch-mail&gt; function or try to open an IMAP
folder.</p>

<p>Warning: you should only use this option when you are on
a fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your
muttrc even if you are the only one who can read the
file.</p>

<p>imap_passive Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to
check for new mail. Mutt will only check for new mail over
existing IMAP connections. This is useful if you dont want
to be prompted to user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or
if opening the con- nection is slow.</p>

<p>imap_peek Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail
as read whenever you fetch a message from the server. This
is generally a good thing, but can make closing an IMAP
folder somewhat slower. This option exists to appease speed
freaks.</p>

<p>imap_pipeline_depth Type: number Default: 15</p>

<p>Controls the number of IMAP commands that may be queued
up before they are sent to the server. A deeper pipeline
reduces the amount of time mutt must wait for the server,
and can make IMAP servers feel much more responsive. But not
all servers cor- rectly handle pipelined commands, so if you
have problems you might want to try setting this variable to
0.</p>

<p>Note: Changes to this variable have no effect on open
connec- tions.</p>

<p>imap_servernoise Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will display warning messages from the
IMAP server as error messages. Since these messages are
often harm- less, or generated due to configuration problems
on the server which are out of the users hands, you may wish
to suppress them at some point.</p>

<p>imap_user Type: string Default:</p>

<p>The name of the user whose mail you intend to access on
the IMAP server.</p>

<p>This variable defaults to your user name on the local
machine.</p>

<p>implicit_autoview Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set to yes, mutt will look for a mailcap entry with
the copiousoutput flag set for every MIME attachment it
doesnt have an internal viewer defined for. If such an entry
is found, mutt will use the viewer defined in that entry to
convert the body part to text form.</p>

<p>include Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are
reply- ing to is included in your reply.</p>

<p>include_onlyfirst Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Controls whether or not Mutt includes only the first
attachment of the message you are replying.</p>

<p>indent_string Type: string Default: &gt;</p>

<p>Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text
quoted in a message to which you are replying. You are
strongly encouraged not to change this value, as it tends to
agitate the more fanat- ical netizens.</p>

<p>The value of this option is ignored if $text_flowed is
set, too because the quoting mechanism is strictly defined
for for- mat=flowed.</p>

<p>This option is a format string, please see the
description of $index_format for supported printf(3)-style
sequences.</p>

<p>index_format Type: string Default: %4C %Z %{%b %d}
%-15.15L (%?l?%4l&amp;%4c?) %s</p>

<p>This variable allows you to customize the message index
display to your personal taste.</p>

<p>Format strings are similar to the strings used in the C
func- tion printf(3) to format output (see the man page for
more details). The following sequences are defined in Mutt:
%a address of the author %A reply-to address (if present;
otherwise: address of author) %b filename of the original
message folder (think mailbox) %B the list to which the
letter was sent, or else the folder name (%b). %c number of
characters (bytes) in the message %C current message number
%d date and time of the message in the format specified by
$date_format converted to senders time zone %D date and time
of the message in the format specified by $date_format
converted to the local time zone %e current message number
in thread %E number of messages in current thread %f sender
(address + real name), either From: or Return-Path: %F
author name, or recipient name if the message is from you %H
spam attribute(s) of this message %i message-id of the
current message %l number of lines in the message (does not
work with maildir, mh, and possibly IMAP folders) %L If an
address in the To: or Cc: header field matches an address
defined by the users subscribe command, this displays To
&lt;list-name&gt;, otherwise the same as %F. %m total number
of message in the mailbox %M number of hidden messages if
the thread is collapsed. %N message score %n authors real
name (or address if missing) %O original save folder where
mutt would formerly have stashed the message: list name or
recipient name if not sent to a list %P progress indicator
for the built-in pager (how much of the file has been
displayed) %s subject of the message %S status of the
message (N/D/d/!/r/*) %t To: field (recipients) %T the
appropriate character from the $to_chars string %u user
(login) name of the author %v first name of the author, or
the recipient if the message is from you %X number of
attachments (please see the attachments sec- tion for
possible speed effects) %y X-Label: field, if present %Y
X-Label: field, if present, and (1) not at part of a thread
tree, (2) at the top of a thread, or (3) X-Label: is
different from preceding messages X-Label:. %Z message

<p>Soft-fill deserves some explanation: Normal
right-justifica- tion will print everything to the left of
the %&gt;, displaying padding and whatever lies to the right
only if theres room. By contrast, soft-fill gives priority
to the right-hand side, guar- anteeing space to display it
and showing padding only if theres still room. If necessary,
soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for rightward
text.</p>

<p>Note that these expandos are supported in save-hook,
fcc- hook and fcc-save-hook, too.</p>

<p>ispell Type: path Default: /usr/bin/hunspell</p>

<p>How to invoke ispell (GNU s spell-checking
software).</p>

<p>keep_flagged Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, read messages marked as flagged will not be
moved from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a
result of a mbox-hook command.</p>

<p>locale Type: string Default: C</p>

<p>The locale used by strftime(3) to format dates. Legal
values are the strings your system accepts for the locale
environment vari- able $LC_TIME.</p>

<p>mail_check Type: number Default: 5</p>

<p>This variable configures how often (in seconds) mutt
should look for new mail. Also see the $timeout
variable.</p>

<p>mailcap_path Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This variable specifies which files to consult when
attempting to display MIME bodies not directly supported by
Mutt.</p>

<p>mailcap_sanitize Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, mutt will restrict possible characters in
mailcap % expandos to a well-defined set of safe characters.
This is the safe setting, but we are not sure it doesn t
break some more advanced MIME stuff.</p>

<p>DOT CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT
YOU ARE DOING!</p>

<p>maildir_header_cache_verify Type: boolean Default:
yes</p>

<p>Check for Maildir unaware programs other than mutt
having modi- fied maildir files when the header cache is in
use. This incurs one stat(2) per message every time the
folder is opened (which can be very slow for NFS
folders).</p>

<p>maildir_trash Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved with
the maildir trashed flag instead of unlinked. Note: this
only applies to maildir-style mailboxes. Setting it will
have no effect on other mailbox types.</p>

<p>mark_old Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls whether or not mutt marks new unread messages
as old if you exit a mailbox without reading them. With this
option set, the next time you start mutt, the messages will
show up with an O next to them in the index menu, indicating
that they are old.</p>

<p>markers Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal
pager. If set, a + marker is displayed at the beginning of
wrapped lines.</p>

<p>Also see the $smart_wrap variable.</p>

<p>mask Type: regular expression Default: !^.[^.]</p>

<p>A regular expression used in the file browser,
optionally pre- ceded by the not operator !. Only files
whose names match this mask will be shown. The match is
always case-sensitive.</p>

<p>mbox Type: path Default: ~/mbox</p>

<p>This specifies the folder into which read mail in your
$spoolfile folder will be appended.</p>

<p>Also see the $move variable.</p>

<p>mbox_type Type: folder magic Default: mbox</p>

<p>The default mailbox type used when creating new folders.
May be any of mbox , MMDF , MH and Maildir. This is
overridden by the -m command-line option.</p>

<p>menu_context Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>This variable controls the number of lines of context
that are given when scrolling through menus. (Similar to
$pager_context.)</p>

<p>menu_move_off Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When unset, the bottom entry of menus will never scroll
up past the bottom of the screen, unless there are less
entries than lines. When set, the bottom entry may move off
the bottom.</p>

<p>menu_scroll Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, menus will be scrolled up or down one line
when you attempt to move across a screen boundary. If unset,
the screen is cleared and the next or previous page of the
menu is dis- played (useful for slow links to avoid many
redraws).</p>

<p>message_cache_clean Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, mutt will clean out obsolete entries from the
message cache when the mailbox is synchronized. You probably
only want to set it every once in a while, since it can be a
little slow (especially for large folders).</p>

<p>message_cachedir Type: path Default:</p>

<p>Set this to a directory and mutt will cache copies of
messages from your IMAP and POP servers here. You are free
to remove entries at any time.</p>

<p>When setting this variable to a directory, mutt needs to
fetch every remote message only once and can perform regular
expres- sion searches as fast as for local folders.</p>

<p>Also see the $message_cache_clean variable.</p>

<p>message_format Type: string Default: %s</p>

<p>This is the string displayed in the attachment menu for
attachments of type message/rfc822. For a full listing of
defined printf(3)-like sequences see the section on
$index_for- mat.</p>

<p>meta_key Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the
high bit (bit 8) set as if the user had pressed the Esc key
and whatever key remains after having the high bit removed.
For example, if the key pressed has an ASCII value of 0xf8,
then this is treated as if the user had pressed Esc then x.
This is because the result of removing the high bit from
0xf8 is 0x78, which is the ASCII character x.</p>

<p>metoo Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If unset, Mutt will remove your address (see the
alternates command) from the list of recipients when
replying to a message.</p>

<p>mh_purge Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When unset, mutt will mimic mhs behavior and rename
deleted messages to ,&lt;old file name&gt; in mh folders
instead of really deleting them. This leaves the message on
disk but makes pro- grams reading the folder ignore it. If
the variable is set, the message files will simply be
deleted.</p>

<p>This option is similar to $maildir_trash for Maildir
folders.</p>

<p>mh_seq_flagged Type: string Default: flagged</p>

<p>The name of the MH sequence used for flagged
messages.</p>

<p>mh_seq_replied Type: string Default: replied</p>

<p>The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied
messages.</p>

<p>mh_seq_unseen Type: string Default: unseen</p>

<p>The name of the MH sequence used for unseen
messages.</p>

<p>mime_forward Type: quadoption Default: no</p>

<p>When set, the message you are forwarding will be
attached as a separate message/rfc822 MIME part instead of
included in the main body of the message. This is useful for
forwarding MIME messages so the receiver can properly view
the message as it was delivered to you. If you like to
switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
variable to ask-no or ask-yes.</p>

<p>Also see $forward_decode and $mime_forward_decode.</p>

<p>mime_forward_decode Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into
text/plain when forwarding a message while $mime_forward is
set. Otherwise $forward_decode is used instead.</p>

<p>mime_forward_rest Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message
from the attachment menu, attachments which cannot be
decoded in a rea- sonable manner will be attached to the
newly composed message if this option is set.</p>

<p>move Type: quadoption Default: no</p>

<p>Controls whether or not Mutt will move read messages
from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a
result of a mbox- hook command.</p>

<p>narrow_tree Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This variable, when set, makes the thread tree narrower,
allow- ing deeper threads to fit on the screen.</p>

<p>net_inc Type: number Default: 10</p>

<p>Operations that expect to transfer a large amount of
data over the network will update their progress every
$net_inc kilobytes. If set to 0, no progress messages will
be displayed.</p>

<p>See also $read_inc, $write_inc and $net_inc.</p>

<p>pager Type: path Default: builtin</p>

<p>This variable specifies which pager you would like to
use to view messages. The value builtin means to use the
built-in pager, otherwise this variable should specify the
pathname of the external pager you would like to use.</p>

<p>Using an external pager may have some disadvantages:
Additional keystrokes are necessary because you cant call
mutt functions directly from the pager, and screen resizes
cause lines longer than the screen width to be badly
formatted in the help menu.</p>

<p>pager_context Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>This variable controls the number of lines of context
that are given when displaying the next or previous page in
the internal pager. By default, Mutt will display the line
after the last one on the screen at the top of the next page
(0 lines of con- text).</p>

<p>This variable also specifies the amount of context given
for search results. If positive, this many lines will be
given before a match, if 0, the match will be
top-aligned.</p>

<p>pager_format Type: string Default: -%Z- %C/%m: %-20.20n
%s%* -- (%P)</p>

<p>This variable controls the format of the one-line
message sta- tus displayed before each message in either the
internal or an external pager. The valid sequences are
listed in the $index_format section.</p>

<p>pager_index_lines Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is
shown when in the pager. The current message, unless near
the top or bottom of the folder, will be roughly one third
of the way down this mini-index, giving the reader the
context of a few messages before and after the message. This
is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
remain to be read in the current thread. One of the lines is
reserved for the status bar from the index, so a setting of
6 will only show 5 lines of the actual index. A value of 0
results in no index being shown. If the number of messages
in the current folder is less than $pager_index_lines, then
the index will only use as many lines as it needs.</p>

<p>pager_stop Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, the internal-pager will not move to the next
message when you are at the end of a message and invoke the
&lt;next-page&gt; function.</p>

<p>pgp_auto_decode Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, mutt will automatically attempt to decrypt
traditional PGP messages whenever the user performs an
operation which ordi- narily would result in the contents of
the message being oper- ated on. For example, if the user
displays a pgp-traditional message which has not been
manually checked with the &lt;check-tra- ditional-pgp&gt;
function, mutt will automatically check the mes- sage for
traditional pgp.</p>

<p>pgp_autoinline Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This option controls whether Mutt generates old-style
inline (traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages under
certain circumstances. This can be overridden by use of the
pgp menu, when inline is not required.</p>

<p>Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for
messages which consist of more than a single MIME part. Mutt
can be con- figured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages
when inline (traditional) would not work.</p>

<p>Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.</p>

<p>Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is
strongly deprecated. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_check_exit Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, mutt will check the exit code of the PGP
subprocess when signing or encrypting. A non-zero exit code
means that the sub- process failed. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_clearsign_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This format is used to create an old-style clearsigned
PGP message. Note that the use of this format is strongly
depre- cated.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_decode_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This format strings specifies a command which is used to
decode application/pgp attachments.</p>

<p>The PGP command formats have their own set of
printf(3)-like sequences: %p Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a
pass phrase is needed, to an empty string otherwise. Note:
This may be used with a %? construct. %f Expands to the name
of a file containing a message. %s Expands to the name of a
file containing the signature part of a multipart/signed
attachment when verify- ing it. %a The value of
$pgp_sign_as. %r One or more key IDs.</p>

<p>For examples on how to configure these formats for the
various versions of PGP which are floating around, see the
pgp and gpg sample configuration files in the samples/
subdirectory which has been installed on your system
alongside the documentation. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_decrypt_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to decrypt a PGP encrypted
message.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_encrypt_only_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to encrypt a body part without
signing it.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_encrypt_sign_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to both sign and encrypt a body
part.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_entry_format Type: string Default: %4n %t%f %4l/0x%k
%-4a %2c %u</p>

<p>This variable allows you to customize the PGP key
selection menu to your personal taste. This string is
similar to $index_format, but has its own set of
printf(3)-like sequences: %n number %k key id %u user id %a
algorithm %l key length %f flags %c capabilities %t
trust/validity of the key-uid association %[&lt;s&gt;] date
of the key where &lt;s&gt; is an strftime(3) expression</p>

<p>(PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_export_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to export a public key from the
users key ring.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_getkeys_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is invoked whenever mutt will need public
key information. Of the sequences supported by
$pgp_decode_command, %r is the only printf(3)-like sequence
used with this format. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_good_sign Type: regular expression Default:</p>

<p>If you assign a text to this variable, then a PGP
signature is only considered verified if the output from
$pgp_verify_command contains the text. Use this variable if
the exit code from the command is 0 even for bad signatures.
(PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_ignore_subkeys Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Setting this variable will cause Mutt to ignore OpenPGP
subkeys. Instead, the principal key will inherit the subkeys
capabili- ties. Unset this if you want to play interesting
key selection games. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_import_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to import a key from a message into
the users public key ring.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_list_pubring_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to list the public key ring s
contents. The output format must be analogous to the one
used by</p>

<p>gpg --list-keys --with-colons.</p>

<p>This format is also generated by the pgpring utility
which comes with mutt.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_list_secring_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to list the secret key rings
contents. The output format must be analogous to the one
used by:</p>

<p>gpg --list-keys --with-colons.</p>

<p>This format is also generated by the pgpring utility
which comes with mutt.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_long_ids Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, use 64 bit PGP key IDs, if unset use the normal
32 bit key IDs. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_mime_auto Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>This option controls whether Mutt will prompt you for
automati- cally sending a (signed/encrypted) message using
PGP/MIME when inline (traditional) fails (for any
reason).</p>

<p>Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is
strongly deprecated. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_replyinline Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt
to cre- ate an inline (traditional) message when replying to
a message which is PGP encrypted/signed inline. This can be
overridden by use of the pgp menu, when inline is not
required. This option does not automatically detect if the
(replied-to) message is inline; instead it relies on Mutt
internals for previously checked/flagged messages.</p>

<p>Note that Mutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for
messages which consist of more than a single MIME part. Mutt
can be con- figured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages
when inline (traditional) would not work.</p>

<p>Also see the $pgp_mime_auto variable.</p>

<p>Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is
strongly deprecated. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_retainable_sigs Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, signed and encrypted messages will consist of
nested multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted body
parts.</p>

<p>This is useful for applications like encrypted and
signed mail- ing lists, where the outer layer
(multipart/encrypted) can be easily removed, while the inner
multipart/signed part is retained. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_show_unusable Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, mutt will display non-usable keys on the PGP key
selec- tion menu. This includes keys which have been
revoked, have expired, or have been marked as disabled by
the user. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_sign_as Type: string Default:</p>

<p>If you have more than one key pair, this option allows
you to specify which of your private keys to use. It is
recommended that you use the keyid form to specify your key
(e.g. 0x00112233). (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_sign_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to create the detached PGP
signature for a multipart/signed PGP/MIME body part.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_sort_keys Type: sort order Default: address</p>

<p>Specifies how the entries in the pgp menu are sorted.
The fol- lowing are legal values: address sort
alphabetically by user id keyid sort alphabetically by key
id date sort by key creation date trust sort by the trust of
the key</p>

<p>If you prefer reverse order of the above values, prefix
it with reverse-. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_strict_enc Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed
messages as quoted-printable. Please note that unsetting
this variable may lead to problems with non-verifyable PGP
signatures, so only change this if you know what you are
doing. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_timeout Type: number Default: 300</p>

<p>The number of seconds after which a cached passphrase
will expire if not used. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_use_gpg_agent Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, mutt will use a possibly-running gpg-agent(1)
process. (PGP only)</p>

<p>pgp_verify_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to verify PGP signatures.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pgp_verify_key_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to verify key information from the
key selection menu.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (PGP
only)</p>

<p>pipe_decode Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Used in connection with the &lt;pipe-message&gt;
command. When unset, Mutt will pipe the messages without any
preprocessing. When set, Mutt will weed headers and will
attempt to decode the messages first.</p>

<p>pipe_sep Type: string Default: 0 The separator to add
between messages when piping a list of tagged messages to an
external Unix command.</p>

<p>pipe_split Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Used in connection with the &lt;pipe-message&gt;
function following &lt;tag-prefix&gt;. If this variable is
unset, when piping a list of tagged messages Mutt will
concatenate the messages and will pipe them all
concatenated. When set, Mutt will pipe the messages one by
one. In both cases the messages are piped in the current
sorted order, and the $pipe_sep separator is added after
each message.</p>

<p>pop_auth_try_all Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will try all available authentication
methods. When unset, Mutt will only fall back to other
authentication methods if the previous methods are
unavailable. If a method is available but authentication
fails, Mutt will not connect to the POP server.</p>

<p>pop_authenticators Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods
mutt may attempt to use to log in to an POP server, in the
order mutt should try them. Authentication methods are
either user, apop or any SASL mechanism, e.g. digest-md5,
gssapi or cram-md5. This option is case-insensitive. If this
option is unset (the default) mutt will try all available
methods, in order from most-secure to least-secure.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>set pop_authenticators=digest-md5:apop:user</p>

<p>pop_checkinterval Type: number Default: 60</p>

<p>This variable configures how often (in seconds) mutt
should look for new mail in the currently selected mailbox
if it is a POP mailbox.</p>

<p>pop_delete Type: quadoption Default: ask-no</p>

<p>If set, Mutt will delete successfully downloaded
messages from the POP server when using the
&lt;fetch-mail&gt; function. When unset, Mutt will download
messages but also leave them on the POP server.</p>

<p>pop_host Type: string Default:</p>

<p>The name of your POP server for the &lt;fetch-mail&gt;
function. You can also specify an alternative port, username
and password, i.e.:</p>

<p>[pop[s]://][username[:password]@]popserver[:port]</p>

<p>where [...] denotes an optional part.</p>

<p>pop_last Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If this variable is set, mutt will try to use the LAST
POP command for retrieving only unread messages from the POP
server when using the &lt;fetch-mail&gt; function.</p>

<p>pop_pass Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Specifies the password for your POP account. If unset,
Mutt will prompt you for your password when you open a POP
mailbox.</p>

<p>Warning: you should only use this option when you are on
a fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your
mut- trc even if you are the only one who can read the
file.</p>

<p>pop_reconnect Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>Controls whether or not Mutt will try to reconnect to
the POP server if the connection is lost.</p>

<p>pop_user Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Your login name on the POP server.</p>

<p>This variable defaults to your user name on the local
machine.</p>

<p>post_indent_string Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Similar to the $attribution variable, Mutt will append
this string after the inclusion of a message which is being
replied to.</p>

<p>postpone Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>Controls whether or not messages are saved in the
$postponed mailbox when you elect not to send
immediately.</p>

<p>Also see the $recall variable.</p>

<p>postponed Type: path Default: ~/postponed</p>

<p>Mutt allows you to indefinitely postpone sending a
message which you are editing. When you choose to postpone a
message, Mutt saves it in the mailbox specified by this
variable.</p>

<p>Also see the $postpone variable.</p>

<p>preconnect Type: string Default:</p>

<p>If set, a shell command to be executed if mutt fails to
estab- lish a connection to the server. This is useful for
setting up secure connections, e.g. with ssh(1). If the
command returns a nonzero status, mutt gives up opening the
server. Example:</p>

<p>set preconnect=ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143
mailhost.net sleep 20 &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null</p>

<p>Mailbox foo on mailhost.net can now be reached as
{local- host:1234}foo.</p>

<p>Note: For this example to work, you must be able to log
in to the remote machine without having to enter a
password.</p>

<p>print Type: quadoption Default: ask-no</p>

<p>Controls whether or not Mutt really prints messages.
This is set to ask-no by default, because some people
accidentally hit p often.</p>

<p>print_command Type: path Default: lpr</p>

<p>This specifies the command pipe that should be used to
print messages.</p>

<p>print_decode Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Used in connection with the &lt;print-message&gt;
command. If this option is set, the message is decoded
before it is passed to the external command specified by
$print_command. If this option is unset, no processing will
be applied to the message when print- ing it. The latter
setting may be useful if you are using some advanced printer
filter which is able to properly format e-mail messages for
printing.</p>

<p>print_split Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Used in connection with the &lt;print-message&gt;
command. If this option is set, the command specified by
$print_command is exe- cuted once for each message which is
to be printed. If this option is unset, the command
specified by $print_command is exe- cuted only once, and all
the messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the
message separator.</p>

<p>Those who use the enscript(1) program s mail-printing
mode will most likely want to set this option.</p>

<p>prompt_after Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If you use an external $pager, setting this variable
will cause Mutt to prompt you for a command when the pager
exits rather than returning to the index menu. If unset,
Mutt will return to the index menu when the external pager
exits.</p>

<p>query_command Type: path Default:</p>

<p>This specifies the command that mutt will use to make
external address queries. The string should contain a %s,
which will be substituted with the query string the user
types. See query for more information.</p>

<p>query_format Type: string Default: %4c %t %-25.25a
%-25.25n %?e?(%e)?</p>

<p>This variable describes the format of the query menu.
The fol- lowing printf(3)-style sequences are understood: %a
destination address %c current entry number %e extra
information * %n destination name %t * if current entry is
tagged, a space otherwise %&gt;X right justify the rest of
the string and pad with X %|X pad to the end of the line
with X %*X soft-fill with character X as pad</p>

<p>For an explanation of soft-fill , see the $index_format
docu- mentation.</p>

<p>* = can be optionally printed if nonzero, see the
$status_format documentation.</p>

<p>quit Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable controls whether quit and exit actually
quit from mutt. If this option is set, they do quit, if it
is unset, they have no effect, and if it is set to ask-yes
or ask-no, you are prompted for confirmation when you try to
quit.</p>

<p>quote_regexp Type: regular expression Default: ^([
]*[|&gt;:}#])+</p>

<p>A regular expression used in the internal pager to
determine quoted sections of text in the body of a message.
Quoted text may be filtered out using the
&lt;toggle-quoted&gt; command, or col- ored according to the
color quoted family of directives.</p>

<p>Higher levels of quoting may be colored differently
(color quoted1 , color quoted2, etc.). The quoting level is
deter- mined by removing the last character from the matched
text and recursively reapplying the regular expression until
it fails to produce a match.</p>

<p>Match detection may be overridden by the $smileys
regular expression.</p>

<p>read_inc Type: number Default: 10</p>

<p>If set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display
which mes- sage it is currently on when reading a mailbox or
when perform- ing search actions such as search and limit.
The message is printed after this many messages have been
read or searched (e.g., if set to 25, Mutt will print a
message when it is at message 25, and then again when it
gets to message 50). This variable is meant to indicate
progress when reading or searching large mailboxes which may
take some time. When set to 0, only a single message will
appear before the reading the mailbox.</p>

<p>Also see the $write_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc
variables and the tuning section of the manual for
performance considera- tions.</p>

<p>read_only Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, all folders are opened in read-only mode.</p>

<p>realname Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This variable specifies what real or personal name
should be used when sending messages.</p>

<p>By default, this is the GECOS field from /etc/passwd.
Note that this variable will not be used when the user has
set a real name in the $from variable.</p>

<p>recall Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>Controls whether or not Mutt recalls postponed messages
when composing a new message.</p>

<p>Setting this variable to is not generally useful, and
thus not recommended.</p>

<p>Also see $postponed variable.</p>

<p>record Type: path Default: ~/sent</p>

<p>This specifies the file into which your outgoing
messages should be appended. (This is meant as the primary
method for saving a copy of your messages, but another way
to do this is using the my_hdr command to create a Bcc:
field with your email address in it.)</p>

<p>The value of $record is overridden by the $force_name
and $save_name variables, and the fcc-hook command.</p>

<p>reply_regexp Type: regular expression Default:
^(re([+])*|aw):[ ]*</p>

<p>A regular expression used to recognize reply messages
when threading and replying. The default value corresponds
to the English Re: and the German Aw:.</p>

<p>reply_self Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you,
Mutt will assume that you want to reply to the recipients of
that message rather than to yourself.</p>

<p>Also see the alternates command.</p>

<p>reply_to Type: quadoption Default: ask-yes</p>

<p>If set, when replying to a message, Mutt will use the
address listed in the Reply-to: header as the recipient of
the reply. If unset, it will use the address in the From:
header field instead. This option is useful for reading a
mailing list that sets the Reply-To: header field to the
list address and you want to send a private message to the
author of a message.</p>

<p>resolve Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to
the next (possibly undeleted) message whenever a command
that modifies the current message is executed.</p>

<p>reverse_alias Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This variable controls whether or not Mutt will display
the personal name from your aliases in the index menu if it
finds an alias that matches the message s sender. For
example, if you have the following alias:</p>

<p>alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)</p>

<p>and then you receive mail which contains the following
header:</p>

<p>From: abd30425@somewhere.net</p>

<p>It would be displayed in the index menu as Joe User
instead of abd30425@somewhere.net. This is useful when the
persons e-mail address is not human friendly.</p>

<p>reverse_name Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a
certain machine, move the messages to another machine, and
reply to some the messages from there. If this variable is
set, the default From: line of the reply messages is built
using the address where you received the messages you are
replying to if that address matches your alternates. If the
variable is unset, or the address that would be used doesn t
match your alternates, the From: line will use your address
on the current machine.</p>

<p>Also see the alternates command.</p>

<p>reverse_realname Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable fine-tunes the behavior of the
$reverse_name fea- ture. When it is set, mutt will use the
address from incoming messages as-is, possibly including
eventual real names. When it is unset, mutt will override
any such real names with the set- ting of the $realname
variable.</p>

<p>rfc2047_parameters Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When this variable is set, Mutt will decode
RFC2047-encoded MIME parameters. You want to set this
variable when mutt suggests you to save attachments to files
named like:</p>

<p>=?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=</p>

<p>When this variable is set interactively, the change wont
be active until you change folders.</p>

<p>Note that this use of RFC2047 s encoding is explicitly
prohib- ited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered
in the wild.</p>

<p>Also note that setting this parameter will not have the
effect that mutt generates this kind of encoding. Instead,
mutt will unconditionally use the encoding specified in
RFC2231.</p>

<p>save_address Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, mutt will take the sender s full address when
choosing a default folder for saving a mail. If $save_name
or $force_name is set too, the selection of the Fcc folder
will be changed as well.</p>

<p>save_empty Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages
will be removed when closed (the exception is $spoolfile
which is never removed). If set, mailboxes are never
removed.</p>

<p>Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt
does not delete MH and Maildir directories.</p>

<p>save_history Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>This variable controls the size of the history (per
category) saved in the $history_file file.</p>

<p>save_name Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages
are saved. When set, a check is made to see if a mailbox
specified by the recipient address exists (this is done by
searching for a mailbox in the $folder directory with the
username part of the recipient address). If the mailbox
exists, the outgoing message will be saved to that mailbox,
otherwise the message is saved to the $record mailbox.</p>

<p>Also see the $force_name variable.</p>

<p>score Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When this variable is unset, scoring is turned off. This
can be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain
folders when the $score_threshold_delete variable and
related are used.</p>

<p>score_threshold_delete Type: number Default: -1</p>

<p>Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or
lower than the value of this variable are automatically
marked for deletion by mutt. Since mutt scores are always
greater than or equal to zero, the default setting of this
variable will never mark a message for deletion.</p>

<p>score_threshold_flag Type: number Default: 9999</p>

<p>Messages which have been assigned a score greater than
or equal to this variable s value are automatically marked
flagged.</p>

<p>score_threshold_read Type: number Default: -1</p>

<p>Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or
lower than the value of this variable are automatically
marked as read by mutt. Since mutt scores are always greater
than or equal to zero, the default setting of this variable
will never mark a message read.</p>

<p>search_context Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>For the pager, this variable specifies the number of
lines shown before search results. By default, search
results will be top-aligned.</p>

<p>send_charset Type: string Default:
us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8</p>

<p>A colon-delimited list of character sets for outgoing
messages. Mutt will use the first character set into which
the text can be converted exactly. If your $charset is not
iso-8859-1 and recipients may not understand UTF-8, it is
advisable to include in the list an appropriate widely used
standard character set (such as iso-8859-2 , koi8-r or
iso-2022-jp) either instead of or after iso-8859-1.</p>

<p>In case the text cannot be converted into one of these
exactly, mutt uses $charset as a fallback.</p>

<p>sendmail Type: path Default: /usr/sbin/sendmail -oem
-oi</p>

<p>Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail
sent by Mutt. Mutt expects that the specified program
interprets addi- tional arguments as recipient
addresses.</p>

<p>sendmail_wait Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the
$sendmail pro- cess to finish before giving up and putting
delivery in the background.</p>

<p>Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:
&gt;0 number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish
before continuing 0 wait forever for sendmail to finish
&lt;0 always put sendmail in the background without
waiting</p>

<p>Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the
output of the child process will be put in a temporary file.
If there is some error, you will be informed as to where to
find the output.</p>

<p>shell Type: path Default:</p>

<p>Command to use when spawning a subshell. By default, the
users login shell from /etc/passwd is used.</p>

<p>sig_dashes Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set, a line containing -- (note the trailing space)
will be inserted before your $signature. It is strongly
recommended that you not unset this variable unless your
signature contains just your name. The reason for this is
because many software to detect your signature. For example,
packages use -- 0 Mutt has the ability to highlight the
signature in a different color in the built-in pager.</p>

<p>sig_on_top Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, the signature will be included before any quoted
or for- warded text. It is strongly recommended that you do
not set this variable unless you really know what you are
doing, and are prepared to take some heat from netiquette
guardians.</p>

<p>signature Type: path Default: ~/.signature</p>

<p>Specifies the filename of your signature, which is
appended to all outgoing messages. If the filename ends with
a pipe (|), it is assumed that filename is a shell command
and input should be read from its standard output.</p>

<p>simple_search Type: string Default: ~f %s | ~s %s</p>

<p>Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search into a
real search pattern. A simple search is one that does not
contain any of the ~ pattern operators. See patterns for
more information on search patterns.</p>

<p>For example, if you simply type joe at a search or limit
prompt, Mutt will automatically expand it to the value
specified by this variable by replacing %s with the supplied
string. For the default value, joe would be expanded to: ~f
joe | ~s joe.</p>

<p>sleep_time Type: number Default: 1</p>

<p>Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying
certain informational messages, while moving from folder to
folder and after expunging messages from the current folder.
The default is to pause one second, so a value of zero for
this option sup- presses the pause.</p>

<p>smart_wrap Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls the display of lines longer than the screen
width in the internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped
at a word boundary. If unset, lines are simply wrapped at
the screen edge. Also see the $markers variable.</p>

<p>smileys Type: regular expression Default: (&gt;From
)|(:[-^]?[][)(&gt;&lt;}{|/DP])</p>

<p>The pager uses this variable to catch some common false
posi- tives of $quote_regexp, most notably smileys and not
consider a line quoted text if it also matches $smileys.
This mostly hap- pens at the beginning of a line.</p>

<p>smime_ask_cert_label Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This flag controls whether you want to be asked to enter
a label for a certificate about to be added to the database
or not. It is set by default. (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_ca_location Type: path Default:</p>

<p>This variable contains the name of either a directory,
or a file which contains trusted certificates for use with
OpenSSL. (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_certificates Type: path Default:</p>

<p>Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with
PGP, mutt has to handle storage and retrieval of keys by
itself. This is very basic right now, and keys and
certificates are stored in two different directories, both
named as the hash-value retrieved from OpenSSL. There is an
index file which contains mailbox-address keyid pairs, and
which can be manually edited. This option points to the
location of the certificates. (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_decrypt_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This format string specifies a command which is used to
decrypt application/x-pkcs7-mime attachments.</p>

<p>The OpenSSL command formats have their own set of
printf(3)-like sequences similar to PGPs: %f Expands to the
name of a file containing a message. %s Expands to the name
of a file containing the signature part of a
multipart/signed attachment when verify- ing it. %k The
key-pair specified with $smime_default_key %c One or more
certificate IDs. %a The algorithm used for encryption. %C CA
location: Depending on whether $smime_ca_location points to
a directory or file, this expands to -CApath
$smime_ca_location or -CAfile $smime_ca_location.</p>

<p>For examples on how to configure these formats, see the
smime.rc in the samples/ subdirectory which has been
installed on your system alongside the documentation.
(S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_decrypt_use_default_key Type: boolean Default:
yes</p>

<p>If set (default) this tells mutt to use the default key
for decryption. Otherwise, if managing multiple certifi-
cate-key-pairs, mutt will try to use the mailbox-address to
determine the key to use. It will ask you to supply a key,
if it cant find one. (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_default_key Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This is the default key-pair to use for signing. This
must be set to the keyid (the hash-value that OpenSSL
generates) to work properly (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_encrypt_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to create encrypted S/MIME
messages.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_encrypt_with Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This sets the algorithm that should be used for
encryption. Valid choices are des , des3, rc2-40, rc2-64,
rc2-128. If unset, 3des (TripleDES) is used. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_get_cert_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to extract X509 certificates from a
PKCS7 structure.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_get_cert_email_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to extract the mail address(es)
used for storing X509 certificates, and for verification
purposes (to check whether the certificate was issued for
the senders mail- box).</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_get_signer_cert_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to extract only the signers X509
certifi- cate from a S/MIME signature, so that the
certificates owner may get compared to the emails From:
field.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_import_cert_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to import a certificate via
smime_keys.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_is_default Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>The default behavior of mutt is to use PGP on all
auto-sign/encryption operations. To override and to use
OpenSSL instead this must be set. However, this has no
effect while replying, since mutt will automatically select
the same applica- tion that was used to sign/encrypt the
original message. (Note that this variable can be overridden
by unsetting $crypt_autosmime.) (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_keys Type: path Default:</p>

<p>Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with
PGP, mutt has to handle storage and retrieval of keys/certs
by itself. This is very basic right now, and stores keys and
certificates in two different directories, both named as the
hash-value retrieved from OpenSSL. There is an index file
which contains mailbox-address keyid pair, and which can be
manually edited. This option points to the location of the
private keys. (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_pk7out_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to extract PKCS7 structures of
S/MIME sig- natures, in order to extract the public X509
certificate(s).</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_sign_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to created S/MIME signatures of
type multi- part/signed, which can be read by all mail
clients.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_sign_opaque_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to created S/MIME signatures of
type appli- cation/x-pkcs7-signature, which can only be
handled by mail clients supporting the S/MIME extension.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_timeout Type: number Default: 300</p>

<p>The number of seconds after which a cached passphrase
will expire if not used. (S/MIME only)</p>

<p>smime_verify_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to verify S/MIME signatures of type
multi- part/signed.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smime_verify_opaque_command Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This command is used to verify S/MIME signatures of type
appli- cation/x-pkcs7-mime.</p>

<p>This is a format string, see the $smime_decrypt_command
command for possible printf(3)-like sequences. (S/MIME
only)</p>

<p>smtp_authenticators Type: string Default:</p>

<p>This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods
mutt may attempt to use to log in to an SMTP server, in the
order mutt should try them. Authentication methods are any
SASL mech- anism, e.g. digest-md5, gssapi or cram-md5. This
option is case-insensitive. If it is unset (the default)
mutt will try all available methods, in order from
most-secure to least-secure.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>set smtp_authenticators=digest-md5:cram-md5</p>

<p>smtp_pass Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Specifies the password for your SMTP account. If unset,
Mutt will prompt you for your password when you first send
mail via SMTP. See $smtp_url to configure mutt to send mail
via SMTP.</p>

<p>Warning: you should only use this option when you are on
a fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your
mut- trc even if you are the only one who can read the
file.</p>

<p>smtp_url Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Defines the SMTP smarthost where sent messages should
relayed for delivery. This should take the form of an SMTP
URL, e.g.:</p>

<p>smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]</p>

<p>where [...] denotes an optional part. Setting this
variable overrides the value of the $sendmail variable.</p>

<p>sort Type: sort order Default: date</p>

<p>Specifies how to sort messages in the index menu. Valid
val- ues are: - date or date-sent - date-received - from -
mailbox-order (unsorted) - score - size - spam - subject -
threads - to</p>

<p>You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify
reverse sorting order (example: set sort=reverse-date-sent
).</p>

<p>sort_alias Type: sort order Default: alias</p>

<p>Specifies how the entries in the alias menu are sorted.
The following are legal values: - address (sort
alphabetically by email address) - alias (sort
alphabetically by alias name) - unsorted (leave in order
specified in .muttrc)</p>

<p>sort_aux Type: sort order Default: date</p>

<p>When sorting by threads, this variable controls how
threads are sorted in relation to other threads, and how the
branches of the thread trees are sorted. This can be set to
any value that $sort can, except threads (in that case, mutt
will just use date-sent). You can also specify the last-
prefix in addi- tion to the reverse- prefix, but last- must
come after reverse-. The last- prefix causes messages to be
sorted against its siblings by which has the last
descendant, using the rest of $sort_aux as an ordering. For
instance,</p>

<p>set sort_aux=last-date-received</p>

<p>would mean that if a new message is received in a
thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the
first, if you have set sort=reverse-threads.)</p>

<p>Note: For reversed $sort order $sort_aux is reversed
again (which is not the right thing to do, but kept to not
break any existing configuration setting).</p>

<p>sort_browser Type: sort order Default: alpha</p>

<p>Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser. By
default, the entries are sorted alphabetically. Valid
values: - alpha (alphabetically) - date - size -
unsorted</p>

<p>You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify
reverse sorting order (example: set
sort_browser=reverse-date).</p>

<p>sort_re Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable is only useful when sorting by threads
with $strict_threads unset. In that case, it changes the
heuristic mutt uses to thread messages by subject. With
$sort_re set, mutt will only attach a message as the child
of another message by subject if the subject of the child
message starts with a substring matching the setting of
$reply_regexp. With $sort_re unset, mutt will attach the
message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
non-$reply_regexp parts of both messages are identical.</p>

<p>spam_separator Type: string Default: ,</p>

<p>This variable controls what happens when multiple spam
headers are matched: if unset, each successive header will
overwrite any previous matches value for the spam label. If
set, each succes- sive match will append to the previous,
using this variables value as a separator.</p>

<p>spoolfile Type: path Default:</p>

<p>If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where
Mutt can- not find it, you can specify its location with
this variable. Mutt will initially set this variable to the
value of the envi- ronment variable $MAIL or $MAILDIR if
either is defined.</p>

<p>ssl_ca_certificates_file Type: path Default:</p>

<p>This variable specifies a file containing trusted CA
certifi- cates. Any server certificate that is signed with
one of these CA certificates is also automatically
accepted.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>set
ssl_ca_certificates_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</p>

<p>ssl_client_cert Type: path Default:</p>

<p>The file containing a client certificate and its
associated pri- vate key.</p>

<p>ssl_force_tls Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If this variable is set, Mutt will require that all
connections to remote servers be encrypted. Furthermore it
will attempt to negotiate TLS even if the server does not
advertise the capabil- ity, since it would otherwise have to
abort the connection any- way. This option supersedes
$ssl_starttls.</p>

<p>ssl_min_dh_prime_bits Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>This variable specifies the minimum acceptable prime
size (in bits) for use in any Diffie-Hellman key exchange. A
value of 0 will use the default from the GNUTLS library.</p>

<p>ssl_starttls Type: quadoption Default: yes</p>

<p>If set (the default), mutt will attempt to use STARTTLS
on servers advertising the capability. When unset, mutt will
not attempt to use STARTTLS regardless of the server s
capabilities.</p>

<p>ssl_use_sslv3 Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable specifies whether to attempt to use SSLv3
in the SSL authentication process.</p>

<p>ssl_use_tlsv1 Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>This variable specifies whether to attempt to use TLSv1
in the SSL authentication process.</p>

<p>ssl_verify_dates Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set (the default), mutt will not automatically accept
a server certificate that is either not yet valid or already
expired. You should only unset this for particular known
hosts, using the &lt;account-hook&gt; function.</p>

<p>ssl_verify_host Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>If set (the default), mutt will not automatically accept
a server certificate whose host name does not match the host
used in your folder URL. You should only unset this for
particular known hosts, using the &lt;account-hook&gt;
function.</p>

<p>status_chars Type: string Default: -*%A</p>

<p>Controls the characters used by the %r indicator in
$sta- tus_format. The first character is used when the
mailbox is unchanged. The second is used when the mailbox
has been changed, and it needs to be resynchronized. The
third is used if the mailbox is in read-only mode, or if the
mailbox will not be written when exiting that mailbox (You
can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox with the
&lt;toggle-write&gt; operation, bound by default to %). The
fourth is used to indicate that the current folder has been
opened in attach- message mode (Cer- tain operations like
composing a new mail, replying, forwarding, etc. are not
permitted in this mode).</p>

<p>status_format Type: string Default: -%r-Mutt: %f
[Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F?
Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l?
%l?]---(%s/%S)-%&gt;-(%P)---</p>

<p>Controls the format of the status line displayed in the
index menu. This string is similar to $index_format, but has
its own set of printf(3)-like sequences: %b number of
mailboxes with new mail * %d number of deleted messages * %f
the full pathname of the current mailbox %F number of
flagged messages * %h local hostname %l size (in bytes) of
the current mailbox * %L size (in bytes) of the messages
shown (i.e., which match the current limit) * %m the number
of messages in the mailbox * %M the number of messages shown
(i.e., which match the cur- rent limit) * %n number of new
messages in the mailbox * %o number of old unread messages *
%p number of postponed messages * %P percentage of the way
through the index %r
modified/read-only/wont-write/attach-message indicator,
according to $status_chars %s current sorting mode ($sort)
%S current aux sorting method ($sort_aux) %t number of
tagged messages * %u number of unread messages * %v Mutt
version string %V currently active limit pattern, if any *
%&gt;X right justify the rest of the string and pad with X
%|X pad to the end of the line with X %*X soft-fill with
character X as pad</p>

<p>For an explanation of soft-fill , see the $index_format
docu- mentation.</p>

<p>* = can be optionally printed if nonzero</p>

<p>Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally
print a string if their value is nonzero. For example, you
may only want to see the number of flagged messages if such
messages exist, since zero is not particularly meaningful.
To optionally print a string based upon one of the above
sequences, the fol- lowing construct is used:</p>

<p>%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;optional_string&gt;?</p>

<p>where sequence_char is a character from the table above,
and optional_string is the string you would like printed if
sequence_char is nonzero. optional_string may contain other
sequences as well as normal text, but you may not nest
optional strings.</p>

<p>Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print
the num- ber of new messages in a mailbox:</p>

<p>%?n?%n new messages.?</p>

<p>You can also switch between two strings using the
following con- struct:</p>


<p>%?&lt;sequence_char&gt;?&lt;if_string&gt;&amp;&lt;else_string&gt;?</p>

<p>If the value of sequence_char is non-zero, if_string
will be expanded, otherwise else_string will be
expanded.</p>

<p>You can force the result of any printf(3)-like sequence
to be lowercase by prefixing the sequence character with an
underscore (_) sign. For example, if you want to display the
local host- name in lowercase, you would use: %_h.</p>

<p>If you prefix the sequence character with a colon ( :)
charac- ter, mutt will replace any dots in the expansion by
underscores. This might be helpful with IMAP folders that
dont like dots in folder names.</p>

<p>status_on_top Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Setting this variable causes the status bar to be
displayed on the first line of the screen rather than near
the bottom. If $help is set, too itll be placed at the
bottom.</p>

<p>strict_threads Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>If set, threading will only make use of the In-Reply-To
and References: fields when you $sort by message threads. By
default, messages with the same subject are grouped together
in pseudo threads.. This may not always be desirable, such
as in a personal mailbox where you might have several
unrelated mes- sages with the subjects like hi which will
get grouped together. See also $sort_re for a less drastic
way of control- ling this behavior.</p>

<p>suspend Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When unset, mutt wont stop when the user presses the
terminals susp key, usually ^Z. This is useful if you run
mutt inside an xterm using a command like xterm -e mutt.</p>

<p>text_flowed Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will generate format=flowed bodies with a
con- tent type of text/plain; format=flowed . This format is
easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
just looks like ordinary text. To actually make use of this
formats fea- tures, youll need support in your editor.</p>

<p>Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is
set.</p>

<p>thorough_search Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in
section patterns . If set, the headers and body/attachments
of mes- sages to be searched are decoded before searching.
If unset, messages are searched as they appear in the
folder.</p>

<p>Users searching attachments or for non-ASCII characters
should set this value because decoding also includes MIME
pars- ing/decoding and possible character set conversions.
Otherwise mutt will attempt to match against the raw message
received (for example quoted-printable encoded or with
encoded headers) which may lead to incorrect search
results.</p>

<p>thread_received Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt uses the date received rather than the
date sent to thread messages by subject.</p>

<p>tilde Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the
bottom of the screen with a tilde (~).</p>

<p>time_inc Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>Along with $read_inc, $write_inc, and $net_inc, this
variable controls the frequency with which progress updates
are dis- played. It suppresses updates less than $time_inc
milliseconds apart. This can improve throughput on systems
with slow termi- nals, or when running mutt on a remote
system.</p>

<p>Also see the tuning section of the manual for
performance con- siderations.</p>

<p>timeout Type: number Default: 600</p>

<p>When Mutt is waiting for user input either idling in
menus or in an interactive prompt, Mutt would block until
input is present. Depending on the context, this would
prevent certain operations from working, like checking for
new mail or keeping an IMAP con- nection alive.</p>

<p>This variable controls how many seconds Mutt will at
most wait until it aborts waiting for input, performs these
operations and continues to wait for input.</p>

<p>A value of zero or less will cause Mutt to never time
out.</p>

<p>tmpdir Type: path Default:</p>

<p>This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will
place its temporary files needed for displaying and
composing messages. If this variable is not set, the
environment variable $TMPDIR is used. If $TMPDIR is not set
then /tmp is used.</p>

<p>to_chars Type: string Default: +TCFL</p>

<p>Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed
to you. The first character is the one used when the mail is
not addressed to your address. The second is used when you
are the only recipient of the message. The third is when
your address appears in the To: header field, but you are
not the only recipient of the message. The fourth character
is used when your address is specified in the Cc: header
field, but you are not the only recipient. The fifth
character is used to indicate mail that was sent by you. The
sixth character is used to indi- cate when a mail was sent
to a mailing-list you subscribe to.</p>

<p>tunnel Type: string Default:</p>

<p>Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to
a com- mand instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use
this to set up preauthenticated connections to your
IMAP/POP3/SMTP server. Example:</p>

<p>set tunnel= ssh -q mailhost.net
/usr/local/libexec/imapd</p>

<p>Note: For this example to work you must be able to log
in to the remote machine without having to enter a
password.</p>

<p>When set, Mutt uses the tunnel for all remote
connections. Please see account-hook in the manual for how
to use different tunnel commands per connection.</p>

<p>uncollapse_jump Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if
any, when the current thread is uncollapsed.</p>

<p>use_8bitmime Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>Warning: do not set this variable unless you are using a
version of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such
as sendmail 8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will invoke $sendmail with the -B8BITMIME
flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP
negotiation.</p>

<p>use_domain Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones
without the @host portion) with the value of $hostname. If
unset, no addresses will be qualified.</p>

<p>use_envelope_from Type: boolean Default: no</p>

<p>When set, mutt will set the envelope sender of the
message. If $envelope_from_address is set, it will be used
as the sender address. If unset, mutt will attempt to derive
the sender from the From: header.</p>

<p>Note that this information is passed to sendmail command
using the -f command line switch. Therefore setting this
option is not useful if the $sendmail variable already
contains -f or if the executable pointed to by $sendmail
doesnt support the -f switch.</p>

<p>use_from Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will generate the From: header field when
send- ing messages. If unset, no From: header field will be
gener- ated unless the user explicitly sets one using the
my_hdr com- mand.</p>

<p>use_idn Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will show you international domain names
decoded. Note: You can use IDNs for addresses even if this
is unset. This variable only affects decoding.</p>

<p>use_ipv6 Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it
tries to contact. If this option is unset, Mutt will
restrict itself to IPv4 addresses. Normally, the default
should work.</p>

<p>user_agent Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will add a User-Agent: header to outgoing
mes- sages, indicating which version of mutt was used for
composing them.</p>

<p>visual Type: path Default:</p>

<p>Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the ~v
command is given in the built-in editor.</p>

<p>wait_key Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after
an external command has been invoked by these functions:
&lt;shell-escape&gt;, &lt;pipe-message&gt;,
&lt;pipe-entry&gt;, &lt;print-message&gt;, and
&lt;print-entry&gt; commands.</p>

<p>It is also used when viewing attachments with auto_view,
pro- vided that the corresponding mailcap entry has a
needsterminal flag, and the external program is
interactive.</p>

<p>When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When unset,
Mutt will wait for a key only if the external command
returned a non-zero status.</p>

<p>weed Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>When set, mutt will weed headers when displaying,
forwarding, printing, or replying to messages.</p>

<p>wrap Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>When set to a positive value, mutt will wrap text at
$wrap char- acters. When set to a negative value, mutt will
wrap text so that there are $wrap characters of empty space
on the right side of the terminal. Setting it to zero makes
mutt wrap at the ter- minal width.</p>

<p>wrap_headers Type: number Default: 78</p>

<p>This option specifies the number of characters to use
for wrap- ping an outgoing messages headers. Allowed values
are between 78 and 998 inclusive.</p>

<p>Note: This option usually shouldn t be changed. RFC5233
recom- mends a line length of 78 (the default), so please
only change this setting when you know what yore doing.</p>

<p>wrap_search Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls whether searches wrap around the end.</p>

<p>When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last)
item. When unset, incremental searches will not wrap.</p>

<p>wrapmargin Type: number Default: 0</p>

<p>(DEPRECATED) Equivalent to setting $wrap with a negative
value.</p>

<p>write_bcc Type: boolean Default: yes</p>

<p>Controls whether mutt writes out the Bcc: header when
prepar- ing messages to be sent. Exim users may wish to
unset this. If mutt is set to deliver directly via SMTP (see
$smtp_url), this option does nothing: mutt will never write
out the Bcc: header in this case.</p>

<p>write_inc Type: number Default: 10</p>

<p>When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every
$write_inc messages to indicate progress. If set to 0, only
a single message will be displayed before writing a
mailbox.</p>

<p>Also see the $read_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables
and the tuning section of the manual for performance
considerations.</p>
