<p>FCLOSE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FCLOSE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fclose - close a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fclose(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fclose() function shall cause the stream
pointed to by stream to be flushed and the associated file
to be closed. Any unwritten buffered data for the stream
shall be written to the file; any unread buffered data shall
be discarded. Whether or not the call succeeds, the stream
shall be disassociated from the file and any buffer set by
the setbuf() or setvbuf() function shall be disassociated
from the stream. If the associated buffer was automatically
allocated, it shall be deallocated.</p>

<p>The fclose() function shall mark for update the st_ctime
and st_mtime fields of the underlying file, if the stream
was writable, and if buffered data remains that has not yet
been written to the file. The fclose() function shall
perform the equivalent of a close() on the file descriptor
that is associated with the stream pointed to by stream.</p>

<p>After the call to fclose(), any use of stream results in
undefined behavior.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fclose() shall
return 0; otherwise, it shall return EOF and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fclose() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file
descriptor underlying stream and the process would be
delayed in the write operation.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is not
valid.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the maximum file size.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the process file size limit.</p>

<p>EFBIG The file is a regular file and an attempt was made
to write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
corresponding stream.</p>

<p>EINTR The fclose() function was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p>EIO The process is a member of a background process
group attempting to write to its controlling terminal,
TOSTOP is set, the process is neither ignoring nor blocking
SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is orphaned.
This error may also be returned under implementation-defined
conditions.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There was no free space remaining on the device
containing the file.</p>

<p>EPIPE An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that
is not open for reading by any process. A SIGPIPE signal
shall also be sent to the thread.</p>

<p>The fclose() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>
