<p>NAME pidstat - Report statistics for Linux tasks.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pidstat [ -C comm ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -I ] [ -l ]
[ -p { pid [,...] | SELF | ALL } ] [ -r ] [ -t ] [ -T { TASK
| CHILD | ALL } ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -w ] [ interval [ count ]
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pidstat command is used for monitoring
individual tasks currently being managed by the Linux
kernel. It writes to standard output activ- ities for every
task selected with option -p or for every task managed by
the Linux kernel if option -p ALL has been used. Not
selecting any tasks is equivalent to specifying -p ALL but
only active tasks (tasks with non-zero statistics values)
will appear in the report.</p>

<p>The pidstat command can also be used for monitoring the
child processes of selected tasks. Read about option -T
below.</p>

<p>The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in
seconds between each report. A value of 0 (or no parameters
at all) indicates that tasks statistics are to be reported
for the time since system startup (boot). The count
parameter can be specified in conjunction with the interval
parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of count
determines the number of reports generated at interval
seconds apart. If the interval parameter is specified
without the count parameter, the pidstat command generates
reports continuously.</p>

<p>You can select information about specific task
activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects
only CPU activity.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C comm Display only tasks whose command name
includes the string comm.</p>

<p>-d Report I/O statistics (kernels 2.6.20 and later
only). The fol- lowing values are displayed:</p>

<p>PID The identification number of the task being
monitored.</p>

<p>kB_rd/s Number of kilobytes the task has caused to be
read from disk per second.</p>

<p>kB_wr/s Number of kilobytes the task has caused, or
shall cause to be written to disk per second.</p>

<p>kB_ccwr/s Number of kilobytes whose writing to disk has
been can- celled by the task. This may occur when the task
trun- cates some dirty pagecache. In this case, some IO
which another task has been accounted for will not be
happen- ing.</p>

<p>Command The command name of the task.</p>

<p>-h Display all activities horizontally on a single line.
This is intended to make it easier to be parsed by other
programs.</p>

<p>-I In an SMP environment, indicate that tasks CPU usage
(as dis- played by option -u ) should be divided by the
total number of processors.</p>

<p>-l Display the process command name and all its
arguments.</p>

<p>-p { pid [,...] | SELF | ALL } Select tasks (processes)
for which statistics are to be reported. pid is the process
identification number. The SELF keyword indicates that
statistics are to be reported for the pidstat process
itself, whereas the ALL keyword indicates that statistics
are to be reported for all the tasks managed by the
system.</p>

<p>-r Report page faults and memory utilization.</p>

<p>When reporting statistics for individual tasks, the
following values are displayed:</p>

<p>PID The identification number of the task being
monitored.</p>

<p>minflt/s Total number of minor faults the task has made
per sec- ond, those which have not required loading a memory
page from disk.</p>

<p>majflt/s Total number of major faults the task has made
per sec- ond, those which have required loading a memory
page from disk.</p>

<p>VSZ Virtual Size: The virtual memory usage of entire
task in kilobytes.</p>

<p>RSS Resident Set Size: The non-swapped physical memory
used by the task in kilobytes.</p>

<p>Command The command name of the task.</p>

<p>When reporting global statistics for tasks and all their
chil- dren, the following values are displayed:</p>

<p>PID The identification number of the task which is being
mon- itored together with its children.</p>

<p>minflt-nr Total number of minor faults made by the task
and all its children, and collected during the interval of
time.</p>

<p>majflt-nr Total number of major faults made by the task
and all its children, and collected during the interval of
time.</p>

<p>Command The command name of the task which is being
monitored together with its children.</p>

<p>-t Also display statistics for threads associated with
selected tasks.</p>

<p>This option adds the following values to the
reports:</p>

<p>TGID The identification number of the thread group
leader.</p>

<p>TID The identification number of the thread being
monitored.</p>

<p>-T { TASK | CHILD | ALL } This option specifies what has
to be monitored by the pidstat command. The TASK keyword
indicates that statistics are to be reported for individual
tasks (this is the default option) whereas the CHILD keyword
indicates that statistics are to be globally reported for
the selected tasks and all their children. The ALL keyword
indicates that statistics are to be reported for individual
tasks and globally for the selected tasks and their
children.</p>

<p>Note: Global statistics for tasks and all their children
are not available for all options of pidstat. Also these
statistics are not necessarily relevant to current time
interval: The statis- tics of a child process are collected
only when it finishes or it is killed.</p>

<p>-u Report CPU utilization.</p>

<p>When reporting statistics for individual tasks, the
following values are displayed:</p>

<p>PID The identification number of the task being
monitored.</p>

<p>%usr Percentage of CPU used by the task while executing
at the user level (application), with or without nice
priority. Note that this field does NOT include time spent
running a virtual processor.</p>

<p>%system Percentage of CPU used by the task while
executing at the system level (kernel).</p>

<p>%guest Percentage of CPU spent by the task in virtual
machine (running a virtual processor).</p>

<p>%CPU Total percentage of CPU time used by the task. In
an SMP environment, the tasks CPU usage will be divided by
the total number of CPUs if option -I has been entered on
the command line.</p>

<p>CPU Processor number to which the task is attached.</p>

<p>Command The command name of the task.</p>

<p>When reporting global statistics for tasks and all their
chil- dren, the following values are displayed:</p>

<p>PID The identification number of the task which is being
mon- itored together with its children.</p>

<p>usr-ms Total number of milliseconds spent by the task
and all its children while executing at the user level
(applica- tion), with or without nice priority, and
collected dur- ing the interval of time. Note that this
field does NOT include time spent running a virtual
processor.</p>

<p>system-ms Total number of milliseconds spent by the task
and all its children while executing at the system level
(ker- nel), and collected during the interval of time.</p>

<p>guest-ms Total number of milliseconds spent by the task
and all its children in virtual machine (running a virtual
pro- cessor).</p>

<p>Command The command name of the task which is being
monitored together with its children.</p>

<p>-V Print version number then exit.</p>

<p>-w Report task switching activity (kernels 2.6.23 and
later only). The following values are displayed:</p>

<p>PID The identification number of the task being
monitored.</p>

<p>cswch/s Total number of voluntary context switches the
task made per second. A voluntary context switch occurs when
a task blocks because it requires a resource that is
unavailable.</p>

<p>nvcswch/s Total number of non voluntary context switches
the task made per second. A involuntary context switch takes
place when a task executes for the duration of its time
slice and then is forced to relinquish the processor.</p>

<p>Command The command name of the task.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The pidstat command takes into account the
following environment vari- able:</p>

<p>S_TIME_FORMAT If this variable exists and its value is
ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing
the date in the report header. The pidstat command will use
the ISO 8601 format (YYYY- MM-DD) instead.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES pidstat 2 5 Display five reports of CPU
statistics for every active task in the system at two second
intervals.</p>

<p>pidstat -r -p 1643 2 5 Display five reports of page
faults and memory statistics for PID 1643 at two second
intervals.</p>

<p>pidstat -T CHILD -r 2 5 Display five reports of page
faults statistics at two second intervals for the child
processes of all tasks in the system. Only child processes
with non-zero statistics values are dis- played.</p>

<p>BUGS /proc filesystem must be mounted for the pidstat
command to work.</p>

<p>FILES /proc contains various files with system
statistics.</p>
