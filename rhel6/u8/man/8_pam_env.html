<p>NAME pam_env - PAM module to set/unset environment
variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_env.so [debug] [conffile=conf-file]
[envfile=env-file] [readenv=0|1] [user_envfile=env-file]
[user_readenv=0|1]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_env PAM module allows the
(un)setting of environment variables. Supported is the use
of previously set environment variables as well as PAM_ITEMs
such as PAM_RHOST.</p>

<p>By default rules for (un)setting of variables is taken
from the config file /etc/security/pam_env.conf if no other
file is specified.</p>

<p>This module can also parse a file with simple KEY=VAL
pairs on separate lines (/etc/environment by default). You
can change the default file to parse, with the envfile flag
and turn it on or off by setting the readenv flag to 1 or 0
respectively.</p>

<p>OPTIONS conffile=/path/to/pam_env.conf Indicate an
alternative pam_env.conf style configuration file to
override the default. This can be useful when different
services need different environments.</p>

<p>debug A lot of debug information is printed with
syslog(3).</p>

<p>envfile=/path/to/environment Indicate an alternative
environment file to override the default. This can be useful
when different services need different environments.</p>

<p>readenv=0|1 Turns on or off the reading of the file
specified by envfile (0 is off, 1 is on). By default this
option is on.</p>

<p>user_envfile=filename Indicate an alternative
.pam_environment file to override the default. This can be
useful when different services need different environments.
The filename is relative to the user home directory.</p>

<p>user_readenv=0|1 Turns on or off the reading of the user
specific environment file. 0 is off, 1 is on. By default
this option is off as user supplied environment variables in
the PAM environment could affect behavior of subsequent
modules in the stack without the consent of the system
administrator.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED The auth and session module types
are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_ABORT Not all relevant data or options
could be gotten.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>
