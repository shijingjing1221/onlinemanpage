<p>TCGETATTR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
TCGETATTR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcgetattr - get the parameters associated with the
terminal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;termios.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tcgetattr(int fildes, struct termios
*termios_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tcgetattr() function shall get the
parameters associated with the terminal referred to by
fildes and store them in the termios structure referenced by
termios_p. The fildes argument is an open file descrip- tor
associated with a terminal.</p>

<p>The termios_p argument is a pointer to a termios
structure.</p>

<p>The tcgetattr() operation is allowed from any
process.</p>

<p>If the terminal device supports different input and
output baud rates, the baud rates stored in the termios
structure returned by tcgetattr() shall reflect the actual
baud rates, even if they are equal. If differ- ing baud
rates are not supported, the rate returned as the output
baud rate shall be the actual baud rate. If the terminal
device does not support split baud rates, the input baud
rate stored in the termios structure shall be the output
rate (as one of the symbolic values).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcgetattr() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The file associated with fildes is not a
terminal.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Care must be taken when changing the terminal
attributes. Applications should always do a tcgetattr(),
save the termios structure values returned, and then do a
tcsetattr(), changing only the necessary fields. The
application should use the values saved from the tcge-
tattr() to reset the terminal state whenever it is done with
the termi- nal. This is necessary because terminal
attributes apply to the under- lying port and not to each
individual open instance; that is, all pro- cesses that have
used the terminal see the latest attribute changes.</p>

<p>A program that uses these functions should be written to
catch all sig- nals and take other appropriate actions to
ensure that when the program terminates, whether planned or
not, the terminal devices state is restored to its original
state.</p>

<p>Existing practice dealing with error returns when only
part of a request can be honored is based on calls to the
ioctl() function. In historical BSD and System V
implementations, the corresponding ioctl() returns zero if
the requested actions were semantically correct, even if
some of the requested changes could not be made. Many
existing applications assume this behavior and would no
longer work correctly if the return value were changed from
zero to -1 in this case.</p>

<p>Note that either specification has a problem. When zero
is returned, it implies everything succeeded even if some of
the changes were not made. When -1 is returned, it implies
everything failed even though some of the changes were
made.</p>

<p>Applications that need all of the requested changes made
to work prop- erly should follow tcsetattr() with a call to
tcgetattr() and compare the appropriate field values.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
