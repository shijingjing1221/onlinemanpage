<p>NAME synaptics - touchpad input driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;synaptics&quot; Option
&quot;Device&quot; &quot;devpath&quot; Option
&quot;Path&quot; &quot;path&quot; ... EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION synaptics is an Xorg input driver for
touchpads. Even though touchpads can be handled by the
normal evdev or mouse drivers, this driver allows more
advanced features of the touchpad to become available. Some
bene- fits would be:</p>

<p>&middot; Movement with adjustable, non-linear
acceleration and speed.</p>

<p>&middot; Button events through short touching of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Double-Button events through double short
touching of the touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Dragging through short touching and holding
down the finger on the touchpad (tap-and-drag gesture).</p>

<p>&middot; Middle and right button events on the upper and
lower corner of the touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; Vertical scrolling (button four and five
events) through moving the finger on the right side of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; The up/down button sends button four/five
events.</p>

<p>&middot; Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven
events) through moving the finger on the lower side of the
touchpad.</p>

<p>&middot; The multi-buttons send button four/five events
for vertical scrolling and button six/seven events for
horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p>&middot; Adjustable finger detection.</p>

<p>&middot; Multifinger taps: two finger for right button
and three finger for middle button events. (Needs hardware
support. Not all models implement this feature.)</p>

<p>&middot; Pressure-dependent motion speed.</p>

<p>Note that depending on the touchpad firmware, some of
these features might be available even without using the
synaptics driver. Note also that some functions are not
available on all touchpad models, because they need support
from the touchpad hardware/firmware. (Multifinger taps for
example.)</p>

<p>The name &quot;synaptics&quot; is historical and the
driver still provides the synaptics protocol parsing code.
Under Linux however, the hardware- specifics are handled by
the kernel and this driver will work for any touchpad that
has a working kernel driver. If your device is recognized as
&quot;PS/2 Mouse&quot; or similar, the kernel driver does
not support your device and this driver will only provide
limited functionality.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

touchpads with physical scroll but- tons. Property:
&quot;Synaptics Button Scrolling&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;UpDownScrollRepeat&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; If on, and the up/down buttons are used
for scrolling (UpDown- Scrolling), these buttons will send
auto-repeating 4/5 events, with the delay between repeats
determined by ScrollButtonRepeat. This option is only
available for touchpads with physical scroll buttons.
Property: &quot;Synaptics Button Scrolling Repeat&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;LeftRightScrollRepeat&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; If on, and the left/right buttons are
used for scrolling (Left- RightScrolling), these buttons
will send auto-repeating 6/7 events, with the delay between
repeats determined by ScrollBut- tonRepeat. This option is
only available for touchpads with physical scroll buttons.
Property: &quot;Synaptics Button Scrolling Repeat&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;ScrollButtonRepeat&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; The number of milliseconds between
repeats of button events 4-7 from the up/down/left/right
scroll buttons. This option is only available for touchpads
with physical scroll buttons. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Button Scrolling Time&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateMidButtonTime&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Maximum time (in milliseconds) for
middle button emulation. Property: &quot;Synaptics Middle
Button Timeout&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateTwoFingerMinZ&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; For touchpads not capable of detecting
multiple fingers but are capable of detecting finger
pressure and width, this sets the Z pressure threshold. When
both Z pressure and W width thresholds are crossed, a two
finger press will be emulated. This defaults to a value that
disables emulation on touchpads with real two- finger
detection and defaults to a value that enables emulation on
remaining touchpads that support pressure and width support.
Property: &quot;Synaptics Two-Finger Pressure&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateTwoFingerMinW&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; For touchpads not capable of detecting
multiple fingers but are capable of detecting finger width
and pressure, this sets the W width threshold. When both W
width and Z pressure thresholds are crossed, a two finger
press will be emulated. This feature works best with
(PalmDetect) off. Property: &quot;Synaptics Two-Fin- ger
Width&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;TouchpadOff&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Switch off the touchpad. Valid values are:</p>

<p>0 Touchpad is enabled 1 Touchpad is switched off
(physical clicks still work) 2 Only tapping and scrolling is
switched off When the touchpad is switched off, button
events caused by a physical button press are still
interpreted. On a ClickPad, this includes software-emulated
middle and right buttons as defined by the SoftButtonAreas
setting.</p>

<p>Property: &quot;Synaptics Off&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;LockedDrags&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If
off, a tap-and-drag gesture ends when you release the
finger. If on, the gesture is active until you tap a second
time, or until LockedDragTimeout expires. Property:
&quot;Synaptics Locked Drags&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;LockedDragTimeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
This parameter specifies how long it takes (in milliseconds)
for the LockedDrags mode to be automatically turned off
after the finger is released from the touchpad. Property:

Instead of being a rectangle, the edge is the ellipse
enclosed by the Left/Right/Top/BottomEdge parameters. For
circular touchpads. Property: &quot;Synaptics Circular
Pad&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;PalmDetect&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If
palm detection should be enabled. Note that this also
requires hardware/firmware support from the touchpad.
Property: &quot;Synaptics Palm Detection&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;PalmMinWidth&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Minimum finger width at which touch is considered a palm.
Prop- erty: &quot;Synaptics Palm Dimensions&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;CoastingSpeed&quot; &quot;float&quot; Your
finger needs to produce this many scrolls per second in
order to start coasting. The default is 20 which should
prevent you from starting coasting unintentionally. 0
disables coast- ing. Property: &quot;Synaptics Coasting
Speed&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;CoastingFriction&quot; &quot;float&quot;
Number of scrolls/second&sup2; to decrease the coasting
speed. Default is 50. Property: &quot;Synaptics Coasting
Speed&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;SingleTapTimeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Timeout after a tap to recognize it as a single tap.
Property: &quot;Synaptics Tap Durations&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;GrabEventDevice&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
If GrabEventDevice is true, the driver will grab the event
device for exclusive use when using the linux 2.6 event
proto- col. When using other protocols, this option has no
effect. Grabbing the event device means that no other user
space or ker- nel space program sees the touchpad events.
This is desirable if the X config file includes
/dev/input/mice as an input device, but is undesirable if
you want to monitor the device from user space. When
changing this parameter with the syn- client program, the
change will not take effect until the synap- tics driver is
disabled and reenabled. This can be achieved by switching to
a text console and then switching back to X.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TapAndDragGesture&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Switch on/off the tap-and-drag gesture. This gesture is an
alternative way of dragging. It is performed by tapping
(touch- ing and releasing the finger), then touching again
and moving the finger on the touchpad. The gesture is
enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the
TapAndDragGesture option to false. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Gestures&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;VertResolution&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Resolution of X coordinates in units/millimeter. The value
is used together with HorizResolution to compensate unequal
verti- cal and horizontal sensitivity. Setting
VertResolution and HorizResolution equal values means no
compensation. Default value is read from the touchpad or set
to 1 if value could not be read. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Pad Resolution&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;HorizResolution&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Resolution of Y coordinates in units/millimeter. The value
is used together with VertResolution to compensate unequal
vertical and horizontal sensitivity. Setting VertResolution
and HorizResolution equal values means no compensation.
Default value is read from the touchpad or set to 1 if value
could not be read. Property: &quot;Synaptics Pad
Resolution&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaLeftEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which start left of
this edge. The option is disabled by default and can be
enabled by setting the AreaLeftEdge option to any integer
value other than zero. If supported by the server (version
1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the
total width of the touchpad. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaRightEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which start right of
this edge. The option is disabled by default and can be
enabled by setting the AreaRightEdge option to any integer
value other than zero. If supported by the server (version
1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the
total width of the touchpad. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaTopEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which start above
this edge. The option is disabled by default and can be
enabled by setting the AreaTopEdge option to any integer
value other than zero. If supported by the server (version
1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the
total height of the touchpad. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AreaBottomEdge&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Ignore movements, scrolling and tapping which start below
this edge. The option is disabled by default and can be
enabled by setting the AreaBottomEdge option to any integer
value other than zero. If supported by the server (version
1.9 and later), the edge may be specified in percent of the
total height of the touchpad. Property: &quot;Synaptics
Area&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;SoftButtonAreas&quot; &quot;RBL RBR RBT RBB
MBL MBR MBT MBB&quot; This option is only available on
ClickPad devices. Enable soft button click area support on
ClickPad devices. The first four parameters are the left,
right, top, bottom edge of the right button, respectively,
the second four parameters are the left, right, top, bottom
edge of the middle button, respectively. Any of the values
may be given as percentage of the touchpad width or height,
whichever applies. If any edge is set to 0 (not 0%), the
button is assumed to extend to infinity in the given direc-
tion. Setting all values to 0 (not 0%) disables soft button
areas. Button areas may not overlap, however it is permitted
for two buttons to share an edge value. Property:
&quot;Synaptics Soft Button Areas&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;HasSecondarySoftButtons&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; This option is only available on
ClickPad devices. Enable the secondary software button area
support. The exact area must be set in option
&quot;SecondarySoftButtonAreas&quot;. See ClickPad support
for more details.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SecondarySoftButtonAreas&quot; &quot;RBL
RBR RBT RBB MBL MBR MBT MBB&quot; This option is only
available on ClickPad devices and only if Option
&quot;HasSecondarySoftButtons&quot; is enabled. Define the
sec- ondary soft button click areas on ClickPad devices
(usually on top of the device). For the allowed values for
this option, see Option &quot;SoftButtonAreas&quot;. Primary
and secondary soft button areas must not overlap each other.
If they do, the behavior of the driver is undefined.
Property: &quot;Synaptics Secondary Soft Button Areas&quot;.
This property is only initialized if Option &quot;Has-
SecondarySoftButtons&quot; is enabled and this option is set
in the xorg.conf(5).</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Area handling The LeftEdge,
RightEdge, TopEdge and BottomEdge parameters are used to
define the edge and corner areas of the touchpad. The
parameters split the touchpad area in 9 pieces, like
this:</p>

<p>| | | LeftEdge | RightEdge +-----+-------------+---+
Physical top edge | 1 | 2 | 3 | +-----+-------------+---+
TopEdge | | | | | 4 | 5 | 6 | | | | |
+-----+-------------+---+ BottomEdge | 7 | 8 | 9 |
+-----+-------------+---+ Physical bottom edge |Physical
left edge | Physical right edge</p>

<p>Coordinates to the left of LeftEdge are part of the left
edge (areas 1, 4 and 7), coordinates to the left of LeftEdge
and above TopEdge (area 1) are part of the upper left
corner, etc.</p>

<p>A good way to find appropriate edge parameters is to use
evtest(1) on the device to see the x/y coordinates
corresponding to different posi- tions on the touchpad.</p>

<p>The perceived physical edges may be adjusted with the
AreaLeftEdge, AreaRightEdge, AreaTopEdge, and AreaBottomEdge
options. If these values are set to something other than the
physical edges, input that starts in the space between the
area edge and the respective physical edge is ignored. Note
that this reduces the available space on the touchpad to
start motions in.</p>

<p>Tapping A tap event happens when the finger is touched
and released in a time interval shorter than MaxTapTime, and
the touch and release coordinates are less than MaxTapMove
units apart. A &quot;touch&quot; event happens when the Z
value goes above FingerHigh, and an &quot;untouch&quot;
event happens when the Z value goes below FingerLow.</p>

<p>The MaxDoubleTapTime parameter has the same function as
the MaxTapTime parameter, but for the second, third, etc tap
in a tap sequence. If you cant perform double clicks fast
enough (for example, xmms depends on fast double clicks),
try reducing this parameter. If you cant get word selection
to work in xterm (ie button down, button up, button down,
move mouse), try increasing this parameter.</p>

<p>The ClickTime parameter controls the delay between the
button down and button up X events generated in response to
a tap event. A too long value can cause undesirable
autorepeat in scroll bars and a too small value means that
visual feedback from the gui application you are interacting
with is harder to see. For this parameter to have any
effect, &quot;FastTaps&quot; has to be disabled.</p>

<p>Acceleration The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor
parameters control the pointer motion speed. The speed value
defines the scaling between touchpad coordinates and screen
coordinates. When moving the finger very slowly, the
MinSpeed value is used, when moving very fast the MaxSpeed
value is used. When moving the finger at moderate speed, you
get a pointer motion speed somewhere between MinSpeed and
MaxSpeed. If you dont want any acceleration, set MinSpeed
and MaxSpeed to the same value.</p>

<p>The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters dont
have any effect on scrolling speed. Scrolling speed is
determined solely from the VertScrollDelta and
HorizScrollDelta parameters. To invert the direc- tion of
vertical or horizontal scrolling, set VertScrollDelta or
HorizScrollDelta to a negative value.</p>

<p>Acceleration is mostly handled outside the driver, thus
the driver will translate MinSpeed into constant
deceleration and adapt MaxSpeed at startup time. This
ensures you can user the other acceleration pro- files,
albeit without pressure motion. However the numbers at
runtime will likely be different from any options you may
have set.</p>

<p>Pressure motion When pressure motion is activated, the
cursor motion speed depends on the pressure exerted on the
touchpad (the more pressure exerted on the touchpad, the
faster the pointer). More precisely the speed is first
calculated according to MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor,
and then is multiplied by a sensitivity factor.</p>

<p>The sensitivity factor can be adjusted using the
PressureMotion parame- ters. If the pressure is below
PressureMotionMinZ, PressureMotionMin- Factor is used, and
if the pressure is greater than PressureMotionMaxZ,
PressureMotionMaxFactor is used. For a pressure value
between Pres- sureMotionMinZ and PressureMotionMaxZ, the
factor is increased lin- early.</p>

<p>Middle button emulation Since most synaptics touchpad
models dont have a button that corre- sponds to the middle
button on a mouse, the driver can emulate middle mouse
button events. If you press both the left and right mouse
but- tons at almost the same time (no more than
EmulateMidButtonTime mil- liseconds apart) the driver
generates a middle mouse button event.</p>

<p>Circular scrolling Circular scrolling acts like a
scrolling wheel on the touchpad. Scrolling is engaged when a
drag starts in the given CircScrollTrigger region, which can
be all edges, a particular side, or a particular cor- ner.
Once scrolling is engaged, moving your finger in clockwise
cir- cles around the center of the touchpad will generate
scroll down events and counter clockwise motion will
generate scroll up events. Lifting your finger will
disengage circular scrolling. Use tight circles near the
center of the pad for fast scrolling and large circles for
better control. When used together with vertical scrolling,
hitting the upper or lower right corner will seamlessly
switch over from vertical to cir- cular scrolling.</p>

<p>Coasting Coasting is enabled by setting the
CoastingSpeed parameter to a non- zero value. Coasting comes
in two flavors: conventional (finger off) coasting, and
corner (finger on) coasting.</p>

<p>Conventional coasting is enabled when coasting is
enabled, and Corner- Coasting is set to false. When
conventional coasting is enabled, hori- zontal/vertical
scrolling can continue after the finger is released from the
lower/right edge of the touchpad. The driver computes the
scrolling speed corresponding to the finger speed
immediately before the finger leaves the touchpad. If this
scrolling speed is larger than the CoastingSpeed parameter
(measured in scroll events per second), the scrolling will
continue with the same speed in the same direction until the
finger touches the touchpad again.</p>

<p>Corner coasting is enabled when coasting is enabled, and
CornerCoasting is set to true. When corner coasting is
enabled, edge scrolling can continue as long as the finger
stays in a corner. Coasting begins when the finger enters
the corner, and continues until the finger leaves the
corner. CornerCoasting takes precedence over the seamless
switch from edge scrolling to circular scrolling. That is,
if CornerCoasting is active, scrolling will stop, and
circular scrolling will not start, when the finger leaves
the corner.</p>

<p>Noise cancellation The synaptics has a built-in noise
cancellation based on hysteresis. This means that incoming
coordinates actually shift a box of predefined dimensions
such that it covers the incoming coordinate, and only the
boxes own center is used as input. Obviously, the smaller
the box the better, but the likelyhood of noise motion
coming through also increases.</p>

<p>ClickPad support A click pad device has button(s)
integrated into the touchpad surface. The user must press
downward on the touchpad in order to generated a button
press. ClickPad support is enabled if the option ClickPad is
set or the property is set at runtime. On some platforms,
this option will be set automatically if the kernel detects
a matching device. On Linux, the device must have the
INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD property set.</p>

<p>ClickPads do not support middle mouse button emulation.
If enabling ClickPad support at runime, the user must also
set the middle mouse button timeout to 0. If auto-detected,
middle mouse button emulation is disabled by the driver.</p>

<p>ClickPads provide software emulated buttons through
Option &quot;SoftBut- tonAreas&quot;. These buttons enable
areas on the touchpad to perform as right or middle mouse
button. When the user performs a click within a defined soft
button area, a right or middle click is performed.</p>

<p>Some laptops, most notably the Lenovo T440, T540 and
x240 series, pro- vide a pointing stick without physical
buttons. On those laptops, the top of the touchpad acts as
software-emulated button area. This area can be enabled with
Option &quot;HasSecondarySoftButtons&quot; and configured
with Option &quot;SecondarySoftButtonAreas&quot;. On some
platforms, this option will be set automatically if the
kernel detects a matching device. On Linux, the device must
have the INPUT_PROP_TOPBUTTONPAD property set.</p>

<p>Synaptics Locked Drags Timeout 32 bit.</p>

<p>Synaptics Tap Action 8 bit, up to MAX_TAP values (see
synaptics.h), 0 disables an element. order: RT, RB, LT, LB,
F1, F2, F3.</p>

<p>Synaptics Click Action 8 bit, up to MAX_CLICK values
(see synaptics.h), 0 disables an element. order: Finger 1,
2, 3.</p>

<p>Synaptics Circular Scrolling 8 bit (BOOL).</p>

<p>Synaptics Circular Scrolling Distance FLOAT.</p>

<p>Synaptics Circular Scrolling Trigger 8 bit, valid values
0..8 (inclusive) order: any edge, top, top + right, right,
right + bottom, bottom, bottom + left, left, left + top.</p>

<p>Synaptics Area The AreaLeftEdge, AreaRightEdge,
AreaTopEdge and AreaBottomEdge parameters are used to define
the edges of the active area of the touchpad. All movements,
scrolling and tapping which take place outside of this area
will be ignored. This property is disabled by default.</p>

<p>32 bit, 4 values, left, right, top, bottom. 0 disables
an ele- ment.</p>

<p>Synaptics Soft Button Areas This property is only
available on ClickPad devices. The Right and middle soft
button areas are used to support right and mid- dle click
actions on a ClickPad device. Providing 0 for all val- ues
of a given button disables the button area.</p>

MBB.</p>

<p>Synaptics Capabilities This read-only property expresses
the physical capability of the touchpad, most notably
whether the touchpad hardware supports multi-finger tapping
and scrolling.</p>

<p>8 bit (BOOL), 7 values (read-only), has left button, has
middle button, has right button, two-finger detection,
three-finger detection, pressure detection, and finger/palm
width detection.</p>

<p>Synaptics Pad Resolution 32 bit unsigned, 2 values
(read-only), vertical, horizontal in units/millimeter.</p>

<p>NOTES Configuration through InputClass sections is
recommended in X servers 1.8 and later. See xorg.conf.d(5)
for more details. An example xorg.conf.d snippet is provided
in ${sourcecode}/conf/50-synaptics.conf</p>

<p>Configuration through hal fdi files is recommended in X
servers 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7. An example hal policy file is
provided in ${source- code}/conf/11-x11-synaptics.fdi</p>

<p>If either of Protocol &quot;auto-dev&quot; (default) or
Protocol &quot;event&quot; is used, the driver initializes
defaults based on the capabilities reported by the kernel
driver. Acceleration, edges and resolution are based on the
dimensions reported by the kernel. If the kernel reports
multi-finger detection, two-finger vertical scrolling is
enabled, horizontal two- finger scrolling is disabled and
edge scrolling is disabled. If no multi-finger capabilities
are reported, edge scrolling is enabled for both horizontal
and vertical scrolling. Tapping is disabled by default for
touchpads with one or more physical buttons. To enable it
you need to map tap actions to buttons. See the
&quot;TapButton1&quot;, &quot;TapButton2&quot; and
&quot;TapButton3&quot; options.</p>

<p>Button mapping for physical buttons is handled in the
server. If the device is switched to left-handed (an
in-server mapping of physical buttons 1, 2, 3 to the logical
buttons 3, 2, 1, respectively), both physical and TapButtons
are affected. To counteract this, the TapBut- tons need to
be set up in reverse order (TapButton1=3, TapButton2=1).</p>

<p>REMOVED OPTIONS The following options are no longer part
of the driver configuration:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Repeater&quot; &quot;string&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;HistorySize&quot; &quot;integer&quot;</p>
