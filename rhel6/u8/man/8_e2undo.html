<p>NAME e2undo - Replay an undo log for an ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS e2undo [ -f ] undo_log device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION e2undo will replay the undo log undo_log for
an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesys- tem found on device. This can be
used to undo a failed operation by an e2fsprogs program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Normally, e2undo will check the filesystem
UUID and last modi- fied time to make sure the undo log
matches with the filesystem on the device. If they do not
match, e2undo will refuse to apply the undo log as a safety
mechanism. The -f option dis- ables this safety
mechanism.</p>
