<p>NAME ldns-keygen - generate a DNSSEC key pair</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-keygen [ OPTION ] DOMAIN</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-keygen is used to generate a
private/public keypair. When run, it will create 3 files; a
.key file with the public DNSKEY, a .private file with the
private keydata and a .ds with the DS record of the DNSKEY
record.</p>

<p>ldns-keygen can also be used to create symmetric keys
(for TSIG) by selecting the appropriate algorithm:
hmac-md5.sig-alg.reg.int, hmac-sha1 or hmac-sha256. In that
case no DS record will be created and no .ds file.</p>

<p>ldns-keygen prints the basename for the key files:
K&lt;name&gt;+&lt;alg&gt;+&lt;id&gt;</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a &lt;algorithm&gt; Create a key with this
algorithm. Specifying list here gives a list of supported
algorithms. Several alias names are also accepted (from
older versions and other software), the list gives names
from the RFC. Also the plain algo number is accepted.</p>

<p>-b &lt;bits&gt; Use this many bits for the key
length.</p>

<p>-k When given, generate a key signing key. This just
sets the flag field to 257 instead of 256 in the DNSKEY RR
in the .key file.</p>

<p>-r device Make ldns-keygen use this file to seed the
random generator with. This will default to /dev/random.</p>

<p>-v Show the version and exit</p>
