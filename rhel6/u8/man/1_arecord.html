<p>NAME arecord, aplay - command-line sound recorder and
player for ALSA sound- card driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS arecord [flags] [filename] aplay [flags]
[filename [filename]] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION arecord is a command-line soundfile recorder
for the ALSA soundcard driver. It supports several file
formats and multiple soundcards with multiple devices. If
recording with interleaved mode samples the file is
automatically split before the 2GB filesize.</p>

<p>aplay is much the same, only it plays instead of
recording. For sup- ported soundfile formats, the sampling
rate, bit depth, and so forth can be automatically
determined from the soundfile header.</p>

<p>If filename is not specified, the standard output or
input is used. The aplay utility accepts multiple
filenames.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Help: show syntax.</p>

<p>--version Print current version.</p>

<p>-l, --list-devices List all soundcards and digital audio
devices</p>

<p>-L, --list-pcms List all PCMs defined</p>

<p>-D, --device=NAME Select PCM by name</p>

<p>-q --quiet Quiet mode. Suppress messages (not sound
:))</p>

<p>-t, --file-type TYPE File type (voc, wav, raw or au). If
this parameter is omitted the WAVE format is used.</p>

<p>-c, --channels=# The number of channels. The default is
one channel. Valid val- ues are 1 through 32.</p>

<p>-f --format=FORMAT Sample format Recognized sample
formats are: S8 U8 S16_LE S16_BE U16_LE U16_BE S24_LE S24_BE
U24_LE U24_BE S32_LE S32_BE U32_LE U32_BE FLOAT_LE FLOAT_BE
FLOAT64_LE FLOAT64_BE IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE IEC958_SUB-
FRAME_BE MU_LAW A_LAW IMA_ADPCM MPEG GSM SPECIAL S24_3LE
S24_3BE U24_3LE U24_3BE S20_3LE S20_3BE U20_3LE U20_3BE
S18_3LE S18_3BE U18_3LE Some of these may not be available
on selected hardware The available format shortcuts are: -f
cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2
-r44100] -f cdr (16 bit big endian, 44100, stereo) [-f
S16_BE -c2 -f44100] -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000,
stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000] If no format is given U8 is
used.</p>

<p>-r, --rate=#&lt;Hz&gt; Sampling rate in Hertz. The
default rate is 8000 Hertz. If the value specified is less
than 300, it is taken as the rate in kilohertz. Valid values
are 2000 through 192000 Hertz.</p>

<p>-d, --duration=# Interrupt after # seconds. A value of
zero means infinity. The default is zero, so if this option
is omitted then the arecord process will run until it is
killed.</p>

<p>-s, --sleep-min=# Min ticks to sleep. The default is not
to sleep.</p>

<p>-M, --mmap Use memory-mapped (mmap) I/O mode for the
audio stream. If this option is not set, the read/write I/O
mode will be used.</p>

<p>-N, --nonblock Open the audio device in non-blocking
mode. If the device is busy the program will exit
immediately. If this option is not set the program will
block until the audio device is available again.</p>

<p>-F, --period-time=# Distance between interrupts is #
microseconds. If no period time and no period size is given
then a quarter of the buffer time is set.</p>

<p>-B, --buffer-time=# Buffer duration is # microseconds If
no buffer time and no buffer size is given then the maximal
allowed buffer time but not more than 500ms is set.</p>

<p>--period-size=# Distance between interrupts is # frames
If no period size and no period time is given then a quarter
of the buffer size is set.</p>

<p>--buffer-size=# Buffer duration is # frames If no buffer
time and no buffer size is given then the maximal allowed
buffer time but not more than 500ms is set.</p>

<p>-A, --avail-min=# Min available space for wakeup is #
microseconds</p>

<p>-R, --start-delay=# Delay for automatic PCM start is #
microseconds (relative to buffer size if &lt;= 0)</p>

<p>-T, --stop-delay=# Delay for automatic PCM stop is #
microseconds from xrun</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Show PCM structure and setup. This option
is accumulative. The VU meter is displayed when this is
given twice or three times.</p>

<p>-V, --vumeter=TYPE Specifies the VU-meter type, either
stereo or mono. The stereo VU-meter is available only for
2-channel stereo samples with interleaved format.</p>

<p>-I, --separate-channels One file for each channel. This
option disables max-file-time and use-strftime, and ignores
SIGUSR1. The stereo VU meter is not available with separate
channels.</p>

<p>-P Playback. This is the default if the program is
invoked by typ- ing aplay.</p>

<p>-C Record. This is the default if the program is invoked
by typing arecord.</p>

<p>-i, --interactive Allow interactive operation via stdin.
Currently only pause/resume via space or enter key is
implemented.</p>

<p>-m, --chmap=ch1,ch2,... Give the channel map to override
or follow. Pass channel posi- tion strings like FL, FR,
etc.</p>

<p>If a device supports the override of the channel map,
aplay tries to pass the given channel map. If it doesnt
support the channel map override but still it provides the
channel map information, aplay tries to rearrange the
channel order in the buffer to match with the returned
channel map from the device.</p>

<p>--disable-resample Disable automatic rate resample.</p>

<p>--disable-channels Disable automatic channel
conversions.</p>

<p>--disable-format Disable automatic format
conversions.</p>

<p>--disable-softvol Disable software volume control
(softvol).</p>

<p>--test-position Test ring buffer position.</p>

<p>--test-coef=&lt;coef&gt; Test coefficient for ring
buffer position; default is 8. Expression for validation is:
coef * (buffer_size / 2). Minimum value is 1.</p>

<p>--test-nowait Do not wait for the ring buffer - eats the
whole CPU.</p>

<p>--max-file-time While recording, when the output file
has been accumulating sound for this long, close it and open
a new output file. Default is the maximum size supported by
the file format: 2 GiB for WAV files. This option has no
effect if --separate-chan- nels is specified.</p>

<p>--process-id-file &lt;file name&gt; aplay writes its
process ID here, so other programs can send signals to
it.</p>

<p>--use-strftime When recording, interpret %-codes in the
file name parameter using the strftime facility whenever the
output file is opened. The important strftime codes are: %Y
is the year, %m month, %d day of the month, %H hour, %M
minute and %S second. In addi- tion, %v is the file number,
starting at 1. When this option is specified, intermediate
directories for the output file are cre- ated automatically.
This option has no effect if --sepa- rate-channels is
specified.</p>

<p>--dump-hw-params Dump hw_params of the device
preconfigured status to stderr. The dump lists capabilities
of the selected device such as supported formats, sampling
rates, numbers of channels, period and buffer
bytes/sizes/times. For raw device hw:X this option basically
lists hardware capabilities of the soundcard.</p>

<p>--fatal-errors Disables recovery attempts when errors
(e.g. xrun) are encoun- tered; the aplay process instead
aborts immediately.</p>

<p>SIGNALS When recording, SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGABRT will
close the output file and exit. SIGUSR1 will close the
output file, open a new one, and con- tinue recording.
However, SIGUSR1 does not work with --separate-chan-
nels.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES aplay -c 1 -t raw -r 22050 -f mu_law foobar
will play the raw file &quot;foobar&quot; as a 22050-Hz,
mono, 8-bit, Mu-Law .au file.</p>

<p>arecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav -D copy foobar.wav will
record foobar.wav as a 10-second, CD-quality wave file,
using the PCM &quot;copy&quot; (which might be defined in
the users .asoundrc file as: pcm.copy { type plug slave {
pcm hw } route_policy copy }</p>

<p>arecord -t wav --max-file-time 30 mon.wav Record from
the default audio source in monaural, 8,000 samples per
second, 8 bits per sample. Start a new file every 30 sec-
onds. File names are mon-nn.wav, where nn increases from 01.
The file after mon-99.wav is mon-100.wav.</p>

<p>arecord -f cd -t wav --max-file-time 3600 --use-strftime
%Y/%m/%d/lis- ten-%H-%M-%v.wav Record in stereo from the
default audio source. Create a new file every hour. The
files are placed in directories based on their start dates
and have names which include their start times and file
numbers.</p>

<p>BUGS Note that .aiff files are not currently
supported.</p>
