<p>AUDITD(8) System Administration Utilities AUDITD(8)</p>

<p>NAME auditd - The Linux Audit daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS auditd [-f] [-l] [-n] [-s
disable|enable|nochange]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION auditd is the userspace component to the
Linux Auditing System. Its responsible for writing audit
records to the disk. Viewing the logs is done with the
ausearch or aureport utilities. Configuring the audit system
or loading rules is done with the auditctl utility. During
startup, the rules in /etc/audit/audit.rules are read by
auditctl and loaded into the kernel. Alternately, there is
also an augenrules pro- gram that reads rules located in
/etc/audit/rules.d/ and compiles them into an audit.rules
file. The audit daemon itself has some configura- tion
options that the admin may wish to customize. They are found
in the auditd.conf file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f leave the audit daemon in the foreground for
debugging. Messages also go to stderr rather than the audit
log.</p>

<p>-l allow the audit daemon to follow symlinks for config
files.</p>

<p>-n no fork. This is useful for running off of inittab or
systemd.</p>

<p>-s=ENABLE_STATE specify when starting if auditd should
change the current value for the kernel enabled flag. Valid
values for ENABLE_STATE are &quot;disable&quot;,
&quot;enable&quot; or &quot;nochange&quot;. The default is
to enable (and disable when auditd terminates). The value of
the enabled flag may be changed during the lifetime of
auditd using auditctl -e.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGHUP causes auditd to reconfigure. This means
that auditd re-reads the configuration file. If there are no
syntax errors, it will proceed to implement the requested
changes. If the reconfigure is successful, a DAEMON_CONFIG
event is recorded in the logs. If not successful, error
handling is controlled by space_left_action,
admin_space_left_action, disk_full_action, and
disk_error_action parameters in auditd.conf.</p>

<p>SIGTERM caused auditd to discontinue processing audit
events, write a shutdown audit event, and exit.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 causes auditd to immediately rotate the logs. It
will consult the max_log_size_action to see if it should
keep the logs or not.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 causes auditd to attempt to resume logging. This
is usually needed after logging has been suspended.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/audit/auditd.conf - configuration file for
audit daemon</p>

<p>/etc/audit/audit.rules - audit rules to be loaded at
startup</p>

<p>/etc/audit/rules.d/ - directory holding individual sets
of rules to be compiled into one file by augenrules.</p>

<p>NOTES A boot param of audit=1 should be added to ensure
that all processes that run before the audit daemon starts
is marked as auditable by the kernel. Not doing that will
make a few processes impossible to properly audit.</p>

<p>The audit daemon can receive audit events from other
audit daemons via the audisp-remote audispd plugin. The
audit daemon may be linked with tcp_wrappers to control
which machines can connect. If this is the case, you can add
an entry to hosts.allow and deny.</p>

aureport(8), auditctl(8), augenrules(8), audit.rules(7).</p>
