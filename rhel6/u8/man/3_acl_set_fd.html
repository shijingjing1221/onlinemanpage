<p>ACL_SET_FD(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_SET_FD(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_set_fd - set an ACL by file descriptor</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acl_set_fd(int fd, acl_t acl);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_set_fd() function associates an
access ACL with the file referred to by fd.</p>

<p>The effective user ID of the process must match the
owner of the file or the process must have the CAP_FOWNER
capability for the request to suc- ceed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The acl_set_fd() function returns the value
0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the
global variable errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_set_fd() function returns the value -1 and and sets
errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EBADF] The fd argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument acl does not point to a valid
ACL.</p>

<p>The ACL has more entries than the file referred to by fd
can obtain.</p>

<p>[ENOSPC] The directory or file system that would contain
the new ACL cannot be extended or the file system is out of
file allocation resources.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] The file identified by fd cannot be associated
with the ACL because the file system on which the file is
located does not support this.</p>

<p>[EPERM] The process does not have appropriate privilege
to perform the operation to set the ACL.</p>

<p>[EROFS] This function requires modification of a file
system which is currently read-only.</p>
