<p>NAME ocount - Event counting tool for Linux</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ocount [ options ] [ --system-wide |
--process-list &lt;pids&gt; | --thread- list &lt;tids&gt; |
--cpu-list &lt;cpus&gt; [ command [ args ] ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ocount is an OProfile tool that can be used
to count native hardware events occurring in either a given
application, a set of processes or threads, a subset of
active system processors, or the entire system. The data
collected during a counting session is displayed to stdout
by default or, optionally, to a file.</p>

<p>When counting multiple events, the kernel may not be
able to count all events simultaneously and, thus, may need
to multiplex the counting of the events. If this happens,
the &quot;Percent time enabled&quot; column in the ocount
output will be less than 100, but counts are scaled up to a
100% estimated value.</p>

<p>RUN MODES One (and only one) of the following run modes
must be specified. If you run ocount using a run mode other
than command [args] , press Ctrl- c to stop ocount when
finished counting (e.g., when the monitored pro- cess ends).
If you background ocount (i.e., with &amp; ) while using one
these run modes, you must stop it in a controlled manner so
that the data collection process can be shut down cleanly
and final results can be displayed. Use kill -SIGINT
&lt;ocount-PID&gt; for this purpose.</p>

<p>command [args] The command is the application for which
to count events. args are the input arguments required by
the application. The com- mand and its arguments must be
positioned at the end of the com- mand line, after all
ocount options.</p>

<p>--process-list / -p pids Use this option to count events
for one or more already-running applications, specified via
a comma-separated list ( pids ). Event counts will be
collected for all children of the passed process(es) as
well.</p>

<p>--thread-list / -r tids Use this option to count events
for one or more already-running threads, specified via a
comma-separated list ( tids ). Event counts will not be
collected for any children of the passed thread(s).</p>

<p>--system-wide / -s This option is for counting events
for all processes running on your system. You must have root
authority to run ocount in this mode.</p>

<p>--cpu-list / -C cpus This option is for counting events
on a subset of processors on your system. You must have root
authority to run ocount in this mode. This is a
comma-separated list, where each element in the list may be
either a single processor number or a range of pro- cessor
numbers; for example: -C 2,3,4-11,15.</p>

<p>OTHER OPTIONS --events / -e event1[,event2[,...]] This
option is for passing a comma-separated list of event spec-
ifications for counting. Each event spec is of the form:
name[:unitmask[:kernel[:user]]] Note: Do not include a count
value in the event spec, as that parameter is only need when
profiling.</p>

<p>You can specify unit mask values using either a
numerical value (hex values must begin with &quot;0x&quot;)
or a symbolic name (if the name=&lt;um_name&gt; field is
shown in the ophelp output). For some named unit masks, the
hex value is not unique; thus, OProfile tools enforce
specifying such unit masks value by name. If no unit mask is
specified, the default unit mask value for the event is
used.</p>

<p>Event names for certain processor types include a
_GRP&lt;n&gt; suf- fix. For such cases, the --events option
may be specified with or without the _GRP&lt;n&gt;
suffix.</p>

<p>When no event specification is given, the default event
for the running processor type will be used for counting.
Use ophelp to list the available events for your processor
type.</p>

<p>--separate-thread / -t This option can be used in
conjunction with either the --pro- cess-list or
--thread-list option to display event counts on a per-thread
(per-process) basis. Without this option, all counts are
aggregated.</p>

<p>NOTE: If new threads are started by the process(es)
being moni- tored after counting begins, the counts for
those threads are aggregated with their parents counts.</p>

<p>--separate-cpu / -c This option can be used in
conjunction with either the --system- wide or --cpu-list
option to display event counts on a per-cpu basis. Without
this option, all counts are aggregated.</p>

<p>--time-interval / -i num_seconds[:num_intervals] Results
collected for each time interval are printed every
num_seconds instead of the default of one dump of cumulative
event counts at the end of the run. If num_intervals is
speci- fied, ocount exits after the specified number of
intervals occur.</p>

<p>--brief-format / -b Use this option to print results in
the following brief format: [optional cpu or
thread,]&lt;event_name&gt;,&lt;count&gt;,&lt;per-
cent_time_enabled&gt; [ &lt;int&gt; ,]&lt; string &gt;,&lt;
u64 &gt;,&lt; double &gt;</p>

<p>If --timer-interval is specified, a separate line
formatted as timestamp,&lt;num_seconds_since_epoch&gt; is
printed ahead of each dump of event counts.</p>

<p>--output-file / -f outfile_name Results are written to
outfile_name instead of interactively to the terminal.</p>

<p>--verbose / -V Use this option to increase the verbosity
of the output.</p>

<p>--version / -v Show ocount version.</p>

<p>--help / -h Display brief usage message.</p>

<p>--usage / -u Display brief usage message.</p>
