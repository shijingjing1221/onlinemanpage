<p>ISATTY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ISATTY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME isatty - test for a terminal device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int isatty(int fildes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The isatty() function shall test whether
fildes, an open file descrip- tor, is associated with a
terminal device.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The isatty() function shall return 1 if
fildes is associated with a terminal; otherwise, it shall
return 0 and may set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The isatty() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid open file
descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The fildes argument is not associated with a
terminal.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The isatty() function does not
necessarily indicate that a human being is available for
interaction via fildes. It is quite possible that non-
terminal devices are connected to the communications
line.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
