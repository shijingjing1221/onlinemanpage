<p>AUTOFS.CONF(23 Jan 2014) AUTOFS.CONF(23 Jan 2014)</p>

<p>NAME autofs.conf - autofs configuration</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Configuration settings used by automount(8)
may be changed in the con- figuration file
/etc/autofs.conf.</p>

<p>This file contains two primary sections, autofs and
amd.</p>

<p>Configuration entries may be present at the beginning of
the configura- tion file without a section header and are
implicitly included as part of the autofs section.</p>

<p>Each section name is enclosed in square brackets with
spaces between the brackets and the section name. The amd
section may be followed by further sections, named by the
top level mount point path, that contain per mount
configuration settings.</p>

<p>SECTION autofs CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Configuration
settings available are:</p>

<p>timeout Sets the default mount timeout in seconds. The
internal program default is 10 minutes, but the default
installed configuration overrides this and sets the timeout
to 5 minutes to be consis- tent with earlier autofs
releases.</p>

<p>negative_timeout Set the default timeout for caching
failed key lookups (program default 60). If the equivalent
command line option is given it will override this
setting.</p>

<p>mount_wait Set the default time to wait for a response
from a spawned mount(8) before sending it a SIGTERM. Note
that we still need to wait for the RPC layer to timeout
before the sub-process exits so this isnt ideal but it is
the best we can do. The default is to wait until mount(8)
returns without intervention.</p>

<p>umount_wait Set the default time to wait for a response
from a spawned umount(8) before sending it a SIGTERM. Note
that we still need to wait for the RPC layer to timeout
before the sub-process exits so this isnt ideal but it is
the best we can do.</p>

<p>browse_mode Maps are browsable by default (program
default &quot;yes&quot;).</p>

<p>mount_nfs_default_protocol Specify the default protocol
used by mount.nfs(8) (program default 3). Since we cant
identify this default automatically we need to set it in the
autofs configuration.</p>

<p>append_options Determine whether global options, given
on the command line or per mount in the master map, are
appended to map entry options or if the map entry options
replace the global options (program default &quot;yes&quot;,
append options).</p>

<p>logging set default log level &quot;none&quot;,
&quot;verbose&quot; or &quot;debug&quot; (program default
&quot;none&quot;).</p>

<p>force_standard_program_map_env override the use of a
prefix with standard environment variables when a program
map is executed. Since program maps are run as the
privileded user setting these standard environment variables
opens automount(8) to potential user privilege escalation
when the program map is written in a language that can load
compo- nents from, for example, a user home directory
(program default &quot;no&quot;).</p>

<p>map_hash_table_size This configuration option may be
used to change the number of hash table slots (default
1024).</p>

<p>This configuration option affects the overhead of
searching the map entry cache for map entries when there are
a large number of entries. It affects the number of entries
that must be looked at to locate a map entry in the map
entry cache. For example, the default of 1024 and a direct
map with 8000 entries would result in each slot containing
an average of 8 entries, which should be acceptable.</p>

<p>However, if excessive CPU usage is observed during
automount lookups increasing this option can reduce the CPU
overhead con- siderably becuase it reduces the length of the
search chains.</p>

<p>Note that the number of entries in a map doesnt
necessarily relate to the number of entries used in the map
entry cache.</p>

<p>There are three distinct cases, direct maps and indirect
maps that use the &quot;browse&quot; option must be read in
their entirity at program start so, in these two cases the
map size does retate directly to the map entry cache
size.</p>

<p>For indirect maps that do not use the &quot;browse&quot;
option entries are added to the map entry cache at lookup so
the number of active cache entries, in this case, is usually
much less than the number of entries in the map. In this
last case it would be unusual for the map entry cache to
grow large enough to warrant increasing the default before
an event that cleans stale entries, a map re-read for
example.</p>

<p>use_hostname_for_mounts NFS mounts where the host name
resolves to more than one IP address are probed for
availability and to establish the order in which mounts to
them should be tried. To ensure that mount attempts are made
only to hosts that are responding and are tried in the order
of hosts with the quickest response the IP address of the
host needs to be used for the mount.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to use the hostname given in the map
entry for the mount regardless, then set this option to
&quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>Be aware that if this is done there is no defense
against the host name resolving to one that isnt responding
and while the number of attempts at a successful mount will
correspond to the number of addresses the host name resolves
to the order will also not correspond to fastest responding
hosts.</p>

<p>LDAP Configuration Configuration settings available
are:</p>

<p>ldap_timeout Set the network response timeout (default
8). Set timeout value for the synchronous API calls. The
default is the LDAP library default of an infinite
timeout.</p>

<p>ldap_network_timeout Set the network response timeout
(default 8).</p>

<p>ldap_uri A space seperated list of server uris of the
form &lt;proto&gt;://&lt;server&gt;[/] where &lt;proto&gt;
can be ldap or ldaps. The option can be given multiple
times. Map entries that include a server name override this
option and it is then not used. Default is an empty list in
which case either the server given in a map entry or the
LDAP configured default is used. This uri list is read at
startup and whenever the daemon receives a HUP signal.</p>

<p>This configuration option can also be used to request
autofs lookup SRV RRs for a domain of the form
&lt;proto&gt;:///[&lt;domain dn&gt;]. Note that a trailing
&quot;/&quot; is not allowed when using this form. If the
domain dn is not specified the dns domain name (if any) is
used to construct the domain dn for the SRV RR lookup. The
server list returned from an SRV RR lookup is refreshed
according to the minimum ttl found in the SRV RR records or
after one hour, whichever is less.</p>

<p>search_base The base dn to use when searching for amap
base dn. This entry may be given multiple times and each
will be checked for a map base dn in the order they occur in
the configuration. The search base list is read at startup
and whenever the daemon recieves a HUP signal.</p>

<p>map_object_class The map object class. In the nisMap
schema this corresponds to the class nisMap and in the
automountMap schema it corresponds to the class
automountMap.</p>

<p>entry_object_class The map entry object class. In the
nisMap schema this corre- sponds to the class nisObject and
in the automountMap schema it corresponds to the class
automount.</p>

<p>map_attribute The attribute used to identify the name of
the map to which this entry belongs. In the nisMap schema
this corresponds to the attribute nisMapName and in the
automountMap schema it corre- sponds to the attribute ou or
automountMapName.</p>

<p>entry_attribute The attribute used to identify a map
key. In the nisMap schema this corresponds to the attribute
cn and in the automountMap schema it corresponds to the
attribute automountKey.</p>

<p>value_attribute The attribute used to identify the value
of the map entry. In the nisMap schema this corresponds to
the attribute nisMapEntry and in the automountMap schema it
corresponds to the attribute automountInformation.</p>

<p>NOTE: It is essential that entries use class and
attribute in a con- sistent manner for correct operation of
autofs. For example mix- ing cn and automountKey attributes
in automount schema will not work as expected.</p>

<p>auth_conf_file This configuration option may be used to
specify an alternate location for the ldap authentication
configuration file. See autofs_ldap_auth.conf(5) for more
information.</p>

<p>SECTION amd CONFIGURATION OPTIONS A number of the amd
configuration options are not used by autofs, some because
they are not relevant within autofs, some because they are
done differently in autofs and others that are not yet
implemented.</p>

<p>Since mount_type is always autofs (because theres no
user space NFS server) the configuration entries relating to
that aren t used. Also, server availability is done
differently within autofs so the options that relate to the
amd server monitoring sub-system are also not used.</p>

<p>These options are mount_type, auto_attrcache,
portmap_program, nfs_vers_ping, nfs_allow_any_interface,
nfs_allow_insecure_port, nfs_proto, nfs_retransmit_counter,
nfs_retransmit_counter_udp, nfs_retransmit_counter_tcp,
nfs_retransmit_counter_toplvl, nfs_retry_interval,
nfs_retry_interval_udp, nfs_retry_interval_tcp,
nfs_retry_interval_toplvl and nfs_vers.</p>

<p>Other options that are not used within the autofs
implementation:</p>

<p>log_file, truncate_log sends its output to syslog so an
alternate log file (or truncat- ing the log) cant be
used.</p>

<p>print_pid Theres no corresponding option for this within
autofs.</p>

<p>use_tcpwrappers, show_statfs_entries There s no user
space NFS server to control access to so this option isnt
relevant. The show_statfs_entries can t be imple- mented for
the same reason.</p>

<p>debug_mtab_file There s no user space NFS server and
autofs avoids using file based mtab whenever possible.</p>

<p>sun_map_syntax Sun map format is handled by autofs
itself.</p>

<p>plock, show_statfs_entries, preferred_amq_port Are not
supported by autofs.</p>

<p>ldap_cache_maxmem, ldap_cache_seconds External ldap
caching is not used by autofs.</p>

<p>ldap_proto_version autofs always attempts to use the
highest available ldap proto- col version.</p>

<p>cache_duration, map_reload_interval, map_options The map
entry cache is continually updated and stale entries cleaned
on re-load, which is done when map changes aredetected so
these configuration entries are not used by autofs.</p>

<p>localhost_address This is not used within autofs. This
configuration option was only used in the amd user space
server code and is not relevant within autofs.</p>

<p>Options that are handled differently within autofs:</p>

<p>pid_file To specify a pid file name a command line
option must be used on startup.</p>

<p>print_version Program version and feature information is
obtained by using the automount command line option
&quot;-V&quot;.</p>

<p>debug_options , log_options autofs has somewhat more
limited logging and debug logging options. When the
log_options options is encountered it is con- verted to the
nearest matching autofs logging option. Since the
configuration option debug_options would be handled the same
way it is ignored.</p>

<p>restart_mounts This option has no sensible meaning
within autofs because autofs always tries to re-connect to
existing mounts. While this has its own set of problems not
re-connecting to existing mounts always results in a
non-functional automount tree if mounts were busy at the
last shutdown (as is also the case with amd when using
mount_type autofs).</p>

<p>forced_unmounts Detaching mounts often causes serious
problems for users of existing mounts. It is used by autofs
in some cases, either at the explicit request of the user
(with a command line or init option) and in some special
cases during program operation but is avoided whenever
possible.</p>

<p>A number of configuration options are not yet
implemented:</p>

<p>search_path Always a little frustrating, the compiled in
map location should be used to locate maps but isnt in some
cases. This requires work within autofs itself and that will
(obviously) include implementing this configuration option
for the amd map parser as well.</p>

<p>fully_qualified_hosts Not yet implemented.</p>

<p>unmount_on_exit Since autofs always tries to re-connect
to mounts left mounted from a previous shutdown this is a
sensible option to implement and that will be done.</p>

<p>browsable_dirs Not yet implemented.</p>

<p>exec_map_timeout A timeout is not currently used for for
program maps, might be implemented.</p>

<p>tag The tag option is not implemented within autofs.</p>

<p>Supported options:</p>

<p>arch, karch, os, osver These options default to what is
returned from uname(2) and can be overridden if
required.</p>

<p>full_os This option has no default and must be set in
the configuration if used in maps.</p>

<p>cluster If not set defaults to the host domain name.
This option corre- sponds to the HP_UX cluster name
(according to the amd source) and is probably not used in
Linux but is set anyway.</p>

<p>vendor This option has a default value of
&quot;unknown&quot;, it must be set in the configuration if
used in maps.</p>

<p>auto_dir Is the base name of the mount tree used for
external mounts that are sometimes needed by amd maps. Its
default value is &quot;/a&quot;.</p>

<p>map_type Specifies the autofs map source, such as file,
nis, ldap etc. and has no default value set.</p>

<p>map_defaults This option is used to override /defaults
entries within maps and can be used to provide different
defaults on specific machines without having to modify
centrally managed maps. It is empty by default.</p>

<p>search_path Colon seperated paths to search for maps
that are not specified as a full path.</p>

<p>dismount_interval Is equivalent to the autofs timeout
option. It is only possible to use this with type
&quot;auto&quot; mounts due to the way the autofs kernel
module performs expiry. It takes its default value from the
autofs internal defaulti of 600 seconds.</p>

<p>autofs_use_lofs If set to &quot;yes&quot; autofs will
attempt to use bind mounts for type &quot;auto&quot; when
possible.</p>

<p>nis_domain Allows setting of a domain name other than
the system default.</p>

<p>local_domain Is used to override (or set) the host
domain name.</p>

<p>normalize_hostnames If set to &quot;yes&quot; then the
contents of ${rhost} is translated in its official host
name.</p>

<p>domain_strip If set to &quot;yes&quot; the domain name
part of the host is strippped when normalizing hostnames.
This can be useful when using of the same maps in a multiple
domain environment.</p>

<p>normalize_slashes This option is set to &quot;yes&quot;
by default and will collapse multi- ple unescaped
occurrences of &quot;/&quot; to a single &quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p>selectors_in_defaults, selectors_on_default This option
has a default value of &quot;no&quot;. If set to
&quot;yes&quot; then any defaults entry will be checked for
selectors to determine the values to be used.
selectors_in_defaults is the preferred option to use.</p>

<p>ldap_base iThis option has no default value. It must be
set to the base dn that is used for queries if ldap is to be
used as a map source.</p>

<p>ldap_hostports This option has no default value set. It
must be set to the URI of the LDAP server to be used for
lookups wheni ldap is used a map source. It may contain a
comma or space seperated list of LDAP URIs.</p>

<p>hesiod_base Sets the base name used for hesiod map
sources.</p>

<p>linux_ufs_mount_type This is an aditional configuration
option for the autofs amd format parser implementation.</p>

<p>There s no simple way to determine what the system
default filesystem is and am-utils needs to be continually
updated to do this and can easily get it wrong ayway. So
allow it to be set in the configuration.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE [ autofs ] timeout = 300 browse_mode = no</p>

<p>[ amd ] dismount_interval = 300 map_type = nis
autofs_use_lofs = no</p>

<p>[ /expamle/mount ] dismount_interval = 60 map_type =
file</p>
