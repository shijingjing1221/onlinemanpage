<p>NAME tput, reset - initialize a terminal or query
terminfo database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tput [-Ttype] capname [parms ... ] tput
[-Ttype] init tput [-Ttype] reset tput [-Ttype] longname
tput -S &lt;&lt; tput -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tput utility uses the terminfo database
to make the values of ter- minal-dependent capabilities and
information available to the shell (see sh(1)), to
initialize or reset the terminal, or return the long name of
the requested terminal type. The result depends upon the
capa- bilitys type:</p>

<p>string tput writes the string to the standard output. No
trailing newline is supplied.</p>

<p>integer tput writes the decimal value to the standard
output, with a trailing newline.</p>

<p>boolean tput simply sets the exit code (0 for TRUE if
the terminal has the capability, 1 for FALSE if it does
not), and writes nothing to the standard output.</p>

<p>Before using a value returned on the standard output,
the application should test the exit code (e.g., $?, see
sh(1)) to be sure it is 0. (See the EXIT CODES and
DIAGNOSTICS sections.) For a complete list of capabilities
and the capname associated with each, see terminfo(5).</p>

<p>-Ttype indicates the type of terminal. Normally this
option is unnec- essary, because the default is taken from
the environment vari- able TERM. If -T is specified, then
the shell variables LINES and COLUMNS will be ignored,and
the operating system will not be queried for the actual
screen size.</p>

<p>capname indicates the capability from the terminfo
database. When term- cap support is compiled in, the termcap
name for the capability is also accepted.</p>

<p>parms If the capability is a string that takes
parameters, the argu- ments parms will be instantiated into
the string.</p>

<p>Most parameters are numbers. Only a few terminfo
capabilities require string parameters; tput uses a table to
decide which to pass as strings. Normally tput uses tparm
(3X) to perform the substitution. If no parameters are given
for the capability, tput writes the string without
performing the substitution.</p>

<p>-S allows more than one capability per invocation of
tput. The capabilities must be passed to tput from the
standard input instead of from the command line (see
example). Only one cap- name is allowed per line. The -S
option changes the meaning of the 0 and 1 boolean and string
exit codes (see the EXIT CODES section).</p>

<p>Again, tput uses a table and the presence of parameters
in its input to decide whether to use tparm (3X), and how to
interpret the parameters.</p>

<p>-V reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
program, and exits.</p>

<p>init If the terminfo database is present and an entry
for the users terminal exists (see -Ttype, above), the
following will occur:</p>

<p>(1) if present, the terminals initialization strings
will be output as detailed in the terminfo(5) section on
Tabs and Initialization,</p>

<p>(2) any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry
will be set in the tty driver,</p>

<p>(3) tabs expansion will be turned on or off according to
the specification in the entry, and</p>

<p>(4) if tabs are not expanded, standard tabs will be set
(every 8 spaces).</p>

<p>If an entry does not contain the information needed for
any of the four above activities, that activity will
silently be skipped.</p>

<p>reset Instead of putting out initialization strings, the
terminals reset strings will be output if present (rs1, rs2,
rs3, rf). If the reset strings are not present, but
initialization strings are, the initialization strings will
be output. Otherwise, reset acts identically to init.</p>

<p>longname If the terminfo database is present and an
entry for the users terminal exists (see -Ttype above), then
the long name of the terminal will be put out. The long name
is the last name in the first line of the terminals
description in the terminfo database [see term(5)].</p>

<p>If tput is invoked by a link named reset, this has the
same effect as tput reset. See tset for comparison, which
has similar behavior.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES tput init Initialize the terminal according to
the type of terminal in the environmental variable TERM.
This command should be included in everyones .profile after
the environmental variable TERM has been exported, as
illustrated on the profile(5) manual page.</p>

<p>tput -T5620 reset Reset an AT&amp;T 5620 terminal,
overriding the type of terminal in the environmental
variable TERM.</p>

<p>tput cup 0 0 Send the sequence to move the cursor to row
0, column 0 (the upper left corner of the screen, usually
known as the &quot;home&quot; cursor position).</p>

<p>tput clear Echo the clear-screen sequence for the
current terminal.</p>

<p>tput cols Print the number of columns for the current
terminal.</p>

<p>tput -T450 cols Print the number of columns for the 450
terminal.</p>

<p>boldtput smsooffbold@TPUT@ rmso Set the shell variables
bold, to begin stand-out mode sequence, and offbold, to end
standout mode sequence, for the current termi- nal. This
might be followed by a prompt: echo &quot;${bold}Please type
in your name: ${offbold} tput hc Set exit code to indicate
if the current terminal is a hard copy terminal.</p>

<p>tput cup 23 4 Send the sequence to move the cursor to
row 23, column 4.</p>

<p>tput cup Send the terminfo string for cursor-movement,
with no parameters substituted.</p>

<p>tput longname Print the long name from the terminfo
database for the type of terminal specified in the
environmental variable TERM.</p>

<p>tput -S &lt;&lt;! &gt; clear &gt; cup 10 10 &gt; bold
&gt; !</p>

<p>This example shows tput processing several capabilities
in one invocation. It clears the screen, moves the cursor to
position 10, 10 and turns on bold (extra bright) mode. The
list is termi- nated by an exclamation mark (!) on a line by
itself.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/terminfo compiled terminal description
database</p>

<p>/usr/share/tabset/* tab settings for some terminals, in
a format appropriate to be output to the terminal (escape
sequences that set margins and tabs); for more information,
see the &quot;Tabs and Initialization&quot; section of
terminfo(5)</p>

<p>EXIT CODES If the -S option is used, tput checks for
errors from each line, and if any errors are found, will set
the exit code to 4 plus the number of lines with errors. If
no errors are found, the exit code is 0. No indication of
which line failed can be given so exit code 1 will never
appear. Exit codes 2, 3, and 4 retain their usual
interpretation. If the -S option is not used, the exit code
depends on the type of cap- name:</p>

<p>boolean a value of 0 is set for TRUE and 1 for
FALSE.</p>

<p>string a value of 0 is set if the capname is defined for
this ter- minal type (the value of capname is returned on
standard output); a value of 1 is set if capname is not
defined for this terminal type (nothing is written to
standard output).</p>

<p>integer a value of 0 is always set, whether or not
capname is defined for this terminal type. To determine if
capname is defined for this terminal type, the user must
test the value written to standard output. A value of -1
means that capname is not defined for this terminal
type.</p>

<p>other reset or init may fail to find their respective
files. In that case, the exit code is set to 4 + errno.</p>

<p>Any other exit code indicates an error; see the
DIAGNOSTICS section.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS tput prints the following error messages and
sets the corresponding exit codes.</p>

<p>exit code error message
---------------------------------------------------------------------
0 (capname is a numeric variable that is not specified in
the terminfo(5) database for this terminal type, e.g. tput
-T450 lines and @TPUT@ -T2621 xmc) 1 no error message is
printed, see the EXIT CODES section. 2 usage error 3 unknown
terminal type or no terminfo database 4 unknown terminfo
capability capname &gt;4 error occurred in -S
---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>PORTABILITY The longname and -S options, and the
parameter-substitution features used in the cup example, are
not supported in BSD curses or in AT&amp;T/USL curses before
SVr4.</p>

<p>X/Open documents only the operands for clear, init and
reset. In this implementation, clear is part of the capname
support. Other implemen- tations of tput on SVr4-based
systems such as Solaris, IRIX64 and HPUX as well as others
such as AIX and Tru64 provide support for capname operands.
A few platforms such as FreeBSD and NetBSD recognize termcap
names rather than terminfo capability names in their
respective tput commands.</p>
