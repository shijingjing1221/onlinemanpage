<p>NAME nfsiostat - Emulate iostat for NFS mount points
using /proc/self/mountstats</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nfsiostat [[&lt;interval&gt;] [&lt;count&gt;]]
[&lt;options&gt;][&lt;mount_point&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nfsiostat command displays NFS client
per-mount statisitics.</p>

<p>&lt;interval&gt; specifies the amount of time in seconds
between each report. The first report contains statistics
for the time since each file system was mounted. Each
subsequent report contains statistics collected during the
interval since the previous report.</p>

<p>&lt;count&gt; If the &lt;count&gt; parameter is
specified, the value of &lt;count&gt; determines the number
of reports generated at seconds apart. if the interval
parameter is specified without the &lt;count&gt; parame-
ter, the command generates reports continuously.</p>

<p>&lt;options&gt; Define below</p>

<p>&lt;mount_point&gt; If one or more &lt;mount point&gt;
names are specified, statistics for only these mount points
will be displayed. Otherwise, all NFS mount points on the
client are listed.</p>

<p>The meaning of each column of nfsiostat s output is the
following: - op/s This is the number of operations per
second. - rpc bklog This is the length of the backlog queue.
- kB/s This is the number of kB written/read per second. -
kB/op This is the number of kB written/read per each opera-
tion. - retrans This is the number of retransmissions. - avg
RTT (ms) This is the duration from the time that clients
kernel sends the RPC request until the time it receives the
reply. - avg exe (ms) This is the duration from the time
that NFS client does the RPC request to its kernel until the
RPC request is completed, this includes the RTT time
above.</p>

<p>Note that if an interval is used as argument to
nfsiostat, then the diffrence from previous interval will be
displayed, otherwise the results will be from the time that
the share was mounted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a or --attr displays statistics related to the
attribute cache</p>

<p>-d or --dir displays statistics related to directory
operations</p>

<p>-h or --help shows help message and exit</p>

<p>-l LIST or --list=LIST only print stats for first LIST
mount points</p>

<p>-p or --page displays statistics related to the page
cache</p>

<p>-s or --sort Sort NFS mount points by ops/second</p>

<p>--version show programs version number and exit</p>
