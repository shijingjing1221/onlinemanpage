<p>Tcl_UpVar(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_UpVar(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_UpVar, Tcl_UpVar2 - link one variable to
another</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_UpVar(interp, frameName, sourceName, destName,
flags)</p>

<p>int Tcl_UpVar2(interp, frameName, name1, name2,
destName, flags)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter containing
variables; also used for error reporting.</p>

<p>const char *frameName (in) Identifies the stack frame
con- taining source variable. May have any of the forms
accepted by the upvar command, such as #0 or 1.</p>

<p>const char *sourceName (in) Name of source variable, in
the frame given by frameName. May refer to a scalar variable
or to an array variable with a parenthe- sized index.</p>

<p>const char *destName (in) Name of destination variable,
which is to be linked to source variable so that references
to destName refer to the other vari- able. Must not
currently exist except as an upvar-ed variable.</p>

<p>int flags (in) One of TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY, TCL_NAMES-
PACE_ONLY or 0; if non-zero, then destName is a global or
namespace variable; otherwise it is local to the current
procedure (or cur- rent namespace if no procedure is
active).</p>

<p>const char *name1 (in) First part of source variables
name (scalar name, or name of array without array
index).</p>

<p>const char *name2 (in) If source variable is an element
of an array, gives the index of the element. For scalar
source variables, is NULL.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_UpVar and Tcl_UpVar2 provide the same
functionality as the upvar command: they make a link from a
source variable to a destination variable, so that
references to the destination are passed transpar- ently
through to the source. The name of the source variable may
be specified either as a single string such as xyx or a(24)
(by calling Tcl_UpVar) or in two parts where the array name
has been separated from the element name (by calling
Tcl_UpVar2). The destination variable name is specified in a
single string; it may not be an array element.</p>

<p>Both procedures return either TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR, and
they leave an error message in the interpreter s result if
an error occurs.</p>

<p>As with the upvar command, the source variable need not
exist; if it does exist, unsetting it later does not destroy
the link. The destina- tion variable may exist at the time
of the call, but if so it must exist as a linked
variable.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS linked variable, upvar, variable</p>
