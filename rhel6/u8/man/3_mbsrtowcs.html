<p>NAME mbsrtowcs - convert a multibyte string to a
wide-character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbsrtowcs(wchar_t *dest, const char **src, size_t
len, mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If dest is not a NULL pointer, the
mbsrtowcs() function converts the multibyte string *src to a
wide-character string starting at dest. At most len wide
characters are written to dest. The shift state *ps is
updated. The conversion is effectively performed by
repeatedly calling mbrtowc(dest, *src, n, ps) where n is
some positive number, as long as this call succeeds, and
then incrementing dest by one and *src by the number of
bytes consumed. The conversion can stop for three
reasons:</p>

<p>1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.
In this case *src is left pointing to the invalid multibyte
sequence, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno is set to
EILSEQ.</p>

<p>2. len non-L&rsquo; &rsquo; wide characters have been
stored at dest. In this case *src is left pointing to the
next multibyte sequence to be con- verted, and the number of
wide characters written to dest is returned.</p>

<p>3. The multibyte string has been completely converted,
including the terminating &rsquo; &rsquo; (which has the
side effect of bringing back *ps to the initial state). In
this case *src is set to NULL, and the num- ber of wide
characters written to dest, excluding the terminating
L&rsquo; &rsquo; character, is returned.</p>

<p>If dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion
proceeds as above, except that the converted wide characters
are not written out to mem- ory, and that no length limit
exists.</p>

<p>In both of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a
static anonymous state only known to the mbsrtowcs()
function is used instead.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least len wide characters at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbsrtowcs() function returns the number
of wide characters that make up the converted part of the
wide-character string, not including the terminating null
wide character. If an invalid multibyte sequence was
encountered, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to
EILSEQ.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of mbsrtowcs() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.</p>
