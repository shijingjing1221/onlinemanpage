<p>XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols - Determine the Xkb key
types appropriate for the symbols bound to a key in a core
keyboard mapping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols (XkbDescPtr xkb,
int map_width, KeySym *core_syms, unsigned int protected,
int *types_inout, KeySym *xkb_syms_rtrn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - xkb keyboard description in which to place
symbols</p>

<p>- map_width width of core protocol keymap in
xkb_syms_rtrn</p>

<p>- core_syms core protocol format array of KeySyms</p>

<p>- protected explicit key types</p>

<p>- types_inout backfilled with the canonical types bound
to groups one and two for the key</p>

<p>- xkb_syms_rtrn backfilled with symbols bound to the key
in the Xkb mapping</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols expands the
symbols in core_syms and types in types_inout, then chooses
canonical key types (canonical key types are defined The
Canonical Key Types) for groups 1 and 2 using the rules
specified by the Xkb protocol and places them in
xkb_syms_rtrn, which will be non-NULL.</p>

<p>The Canonical Key Types</p>

<p>Xkb allows up to XkbMaxKeyTypes (255) key types to be
defined, but requires at least XkbNumRequiredTypes (4)
predefined types to be in a key map. These predefined key
types are referred to as the canonical key types and
describe the types of keys available on most keyboards. The
definitions for the canonical key types are held in the
first Xkb- NumRequiredTypes entries of the types field of
the client map and are indexed using the following
constants:</p>

<p>XkbOneLevelIndex XkbTwoLevelIndex XkbAlphabeticIndex
XkbKeypadIndex</p>

<p>ONE_LEVEL</p>

<p>The ONE_LEVEL key type describes groups that have only
one symbol. The default ONE_LEVEL key type has no map
entries and does not pay atten- tion to any modifiers. A
symbolic representation of this key type could look like the
following:</p>

<p>type &quot;ONE_LEVEL&quot; { modifiers = None;
map[None]= Level1; level_name[Level1]= &quot;Any&quot;;
};</p>

<p>The description of the ONE_LEVEL key type is stored in
the types[XkbOneLevelIndex] entry of the client key map.</p>

<p>TWO_LEVEL</p>

<p>The TWO_LEVEL key type describes groups that consist of
two symbols but are neither alphabetic nor numeric keypad
keys. The default TWO_LEVEL type uses only the Shift
modifier. It returns shift level two if Shift is set, and
level one if it is not. A symbolic representation of this
key type could look like the following:</p>

<p>type &quot;TWO_LEVEL&quot; { modifiers = Shift;
map[Shift]= Level2; level_name[Level1]= &quot;Base&quot;;
level_name[Level2]= &quot;Shift&quot;; };</p>

<p>The description of the TWO_LEVEL key type is stored in
the types[XkbT- woLevelIndex] entry of the client key
map.</p>

<p>ALPHABETIC</p>

<p>The ALPHABETIC key type describes groups consisting of
two symbols: the lowercase form of a symbol followed by the
uppercase form of the same symbol. The default ALPHABETIC
type implements locale-sensitive &quot;Shift cancels
CapsLock&quot; behavior using both the Shift and Lock
modifiers as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If Shift and Lock are both set, the default
ALPHABETIC type yields level one.</p>

<p>&middot; If Shift alone is set, it yields level two.</p>

<p>&middot; If Lock alone is set, it yields level one, but
preserves the Lock modifier so Xlib notices and applies the
appropriate capitaliza- tion rules. The Xlib functions are
locale-sensitive and apply dif- ferent capitalization rules
for different locales.</p>

<p>&middot; If neither Shift nor Lock is set, it yields
level one.</p>

<p>A symbolic representation of this key type could look
like the following:</p>

<p>type &quot;ALPHABETIC&quot; { modifiers = Shift+Lock;
map[Shift]= Level2; preserve[Lock]= Lock;
level_name[Level1]= &quot;Base&quot;; level_name[Level2]=
&quot;Caps&quot;; };</p>

<p>The description of the ALPHABETIC key type is stored in
the types[XkbAlphabeticIndex] entry of the client key
map.</p>

<p>KEYPAD</p>

<p>The KEYPAD key type describes groups that consist of two
symbols, at least one of which is a numeric keypad symbol.
The numeric key- pad symbol is assumed to reside at level
two. The default KEYPAD key type implements &quot;Shift
cancels NumLock&quot; behavior using the Shift modifier and
the real modifier bound to the virtual modifier named
&quot;NumLock,&quot; known as the NumLock modifier, as
follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If Shift and NumLock are both set, the default
KEYPAD type yields level one.</p>

<p>&middot; If Shift alone is set, it yields level two.</p>

<p>&middot; If NumLock alone is set, it yields level
two.</p>

<p>&middot; If neither Shift nor NumLock is set, it yields
level one.</p>

<p>A symbolic representation of this key type could look
like the following:</p>

<p>type &quot;KEYPAD&quot; { modifiers = Shift+NumLock;
map[None]= Level1; map[Shift]= Level2; map[NumLock]= Level2;
map[Shift+NumLock]= Level1; level_name[Level1]=
&quot;Base&quot;; level_name[Level2]= &quot;Caps&quot;;
};</p>

<p>The description of the KEYPAD key type is stored in the
types[XkbKeypadIndex] entry of the client key map.</p>

<p>A core keymap is a two-dimensional array of keysyms. It
has map_width columns and max_key_code rows.
XkbKeyTypesForCoreSym- bols takes a single row from a core
keymap, determines the number of groups associated with it,
the type of each group, and the sym- bols bound to each
group. The return value is the number of groups, types_inout
has the types for each group, and xkb_syms_rtrn has the
symbols in Xkb order (that is, groups are contiguous,
regardless of size).</p>

<p>protected contains the explicitly protected key types.
There is one explicit override control associated with each
of the four possible groups for each Xkb key,
ExplicitKeyType1 through Explic- itKeyType4; protected is an
inclusive OR of these controls. map_width is the width of
the core keymap and is not dependent on any Xkb definitions.
types_inout is an array of four type indices. On input,
types_inout contains the indices of any types already
assigned to the key, in case they are explicitly protected
from change.</p>

<p>Upon return, types_inout contains any automatically
selected (that is, canonical) types plus any protected
types. Canonical types are assigned to all four groups if
there are enough symbols to do so. The four entries in
types_inout correspond to the four groups for the key in
question.</p>
