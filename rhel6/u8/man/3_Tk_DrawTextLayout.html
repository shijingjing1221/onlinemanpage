<p>NAME Tk_ComputeTextLayout, Tk_FreeTextLayout,
Tk_DrawTextLayout, Tk_Under- lineTextLayout, Tk_PointToChar,
Tk_CharBbox, Tk_DistanceToTextLayout,
Tk_IntersectTextLayout, Tk_TextLayoutToPostscript - routines
to measure and display single-font, multi-line, justified
text.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_TextLayout Tk_ComputeTextLayout(tkfont, string,
numChars, wrapLength, justify, flags, widthPtr,
heightPtr)</p>

<p>void Tk_FreeTextLayout(layout)</p>

<p>void Tk_DrawTextLayout(display, drawable, gc, layout, x,
y, firstChar, lastChar)</p>

<p>void Tk_UnderlineTextLayout(display, drawable, gc,
layout, x, y, underline)</p>

<p>int Tk_PointToChar(layout, x, y)</p>

<p>int Tk_CharBbox(layout, index, xPtr, yPtr, widthPtr,
heightPtr)</p>

<p>int Tk_DistanceToTextLayout(layout, x, y)</p>

<p>int Tk_IntersectTextLayout(layout, x, y, width,
height)</p>

<p>void Tk_TextLayoutToPostscript(interp, layout)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Font tkfont (in) Font to use when
constructing and displaying a text layout. The tkfont must
remain valid for the lifetime of the text layout. Must have
been returned by a previous call to Tk_GetFont.</p>

<p>const char *string (in) Potentially multi-line string
whose dimensions are to be computed and stored in the text
layout. The string must remain valid for the lifetime of the
text layout.</p>

<p>int numChars (in) The number of characters to consider
from string. If num- Chars is less than 0, then assumes
string is null termi- nated and uses Tcl_NumUtfChars to
determine the length of string.</p>

<p>int wrapLength (in) Longest permissible line length, in
pixels. Lines in string will automatically be broken at word
boundaries and wrapped when they reach this length. If
wrapLength is too small for even a single char- acter to fit
on a line, it will be expanded to allow one character to fit
on each line. If wrapLength is &lt;= 0, there is no
automatic wrapping; lines will get as long as they need to
be and only wrap if a newline/return character is
encountered.</p>

<p>Tk_Justify justify (in) How to justify the lines in a
multi-line text layout. Pos- sible values are TK_JUS-
TIFY_LEFT, TK_JUSTIFY_CENTER, or TK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT. If the
text layout only occupies a single line, then justify is
irrelevant.</p>

<p>int flags (in) Various flag bits OR-ed together.
TK_IGNORE_TABS means that tab characters should not be
expanded to the next tab stop. TK_IGNORE_NEWLINES means that
newline/return characters should not cause a line break. If
either tabs or newlines/returns are ignored, then they will
be treated as regular characters, being mea- sured and
displayed in a plat- form-dependent manner as described in
Tk_MeasureChars, and will not have any special
behaviors.</p>

<p>int *widthPtr (out) If non-NULL, filled with either the
width, in pixels, of the widest line in the text layout, or
the width, in pix- els, of the bounding box for the
character specified by index.</p>

<p>int *heightPtr (out) If non-NULL, filled with either the
total height, in pixels, of all the lines in the text
layout, or the height, in pixels, of the bounding box for
the character specified by index.</p>

<p>Tk_TextLayout layout (in) A token that represents the
cached layout information about the single-font, multi-
line, justified piece of text. This token is returned by
Tk_ComputeTextLayout.</p>

<p>Display *display (in) Display on which to draw.</p>

<p>Drawable drawable (in) Window or pixmap in which to
draw.</p>

<p>GC gc (in) Graphics context to use for drawing text
layout. The font selected in this GC must cor- respond to
the tkfont used when constructing the text layout.</p>

<p>int x, y (in) Point, in pixels, at which to place the
upper-left hand cor- ner of the text layout when it is being
drawn, or the coordi- nates of a point (with respect to the
upper-left hand corner of the text layout) to check against
the text layout.</p>

<p>int firstChar (in) The index of the first charac- ter to
draw from the given text layout. The number 0 means to draw
from the begin- ning.</p>

<p>int lastChar (in) The index of the last charac- ter up
to which to draw. The character specified by lastChar itself
will not be drawn. A number less than 0 means to draw all
characters in the text layout.</p>

<p>int underline (in) Index of the single character to
underline in the text lay- out, or a number less than 0 for
no underline.</p>

<p>int index (in) The index of the character whose bounding
box is desired. The bounding box is computed with respect to
the upper-left hand corner of the text lay- out.</p>

<p>int *xPtr, *yPtr (out) Filled with the upper-left hand
corner, in pixels, of the bounding box for the character
specified by index. Either or both xPtr and yPtr may be
NULL, in which case the corre- sponding value is not calcu-
lated.</p>

<p>int width, height (in) Specifies the width and height,
in pixels, of the rectangular area to compare for
intersection against the text layout.</p>

<p>Tcl_Interp *interp (out) Postscript code that will print
the text layout is appended to interp-&gt;result.

<p>DESCRIPTION These routines are for measuring and
displaying single-font, multi- line, justified text. To
measure and display simple single-font, sin- gle-line
strings, refer to the documentation for Tk_MeasureChars.
There is no programming interface in the core of Tk that
supports multi-font, multi-line text; support for that
behavior must be built on top of simpler layers. Note that
unlike the lower level text display routines, the functions
described here all operate on character-ori- ented lengths
and indices rather than byte-oriented values. See the
description of Tcl_UtfAtIndex for more details on converting
between character and byte offsets.</p>

<p>The routines described here are built on top of the
programming inter- face described in the Tk_MeasureChars
documentation. Tab characters and newline/return characters
may be treated specially by these proce- dures, but all
other characters are passed through to the lower level.</p>

<p>Tk_ComputeTextLayout computes the layout information
needed to display a single-font, multi-line, justified
string of text and returns a Tk_TextLayout token that holds
this information. This token is used in subsequent calls to
procedures such as Tk_DrawTextLayout, Tk_Distance-
ToTextLayout, and Tk_FreeTextLayout. The string and tkfont
used when computing the layout must remain valid for the
lifetime of this token.</p>

<p>Tk_FreeTextLayout is called to release the storage
associated with lay- out when it is no longer needed. A
layout should not be used in any other text layout
procedures once it has been released.</p>

<p>Tk_DrawTextLayout uses the information in layout to
display a single- font, multi-line, justified string of text
at the specified location.</p>

<p>Tk_UnderlineTextLayout uses the information in layout to
display an underline below an individual character. This
procedure does not draw the text, just the underline. To
produce natively underlined text, an underlined font should
be constructed and used. All characters, including tabs,
newline/return characters, and spaces at the ends of lines,
can be underlined using this method. However, the underline
will never be drawn outside of the computed width of layout;
the under- line will stop at the edge for any character that
would extend par- tially outside of layout, and the
underline will not be visible at all for any character that
would be located completely outside of the lay- out.</p>

<p>Tk_PointToChar uses the information in layout to
determine the charac- ter closest to the given point. The
point is specified with respect to the upper-left hand
corner of the layout, which is considered to be located at
(0, 0). Any point whose y-value is less that 0 will be con-
sidered closest to the first character in the text layout;
any point whose y-value is greater than the height of the
text layout will be considered closest to the last character
in the text layout. Any point whose x-value is less than 0
will be considered closest to the first character on that
line; any point whose x-value is greater than the width of
the text layout will be considered closest to the last
charac- ter on that line. The return value is the index of
the character that was closest to the point. Given a layout
with no characters, the value 0 will always be returned,
referring to a hypothetical zero-width placeholder
character.</p>

<p>Tk_CharBbox uses the information in layout to return the
bounding box for the character specified by index. The width
of the bounding box is the advance width of the character,
and does not include any left or right bearing. Any
character that extends partially outside of layout is
considered to be truncated at the edge. Any character that
would be located completely outside of layout is considered
to be zero-width and pegged against the edge. The height of
the bounding box is the line height for this font, extending
from the top of the ascent to the bot- tom of the descent;
information about the actual height of individual letters is
not available. For measurement purposes, a layout that con-
tains no characters is considered to contain a single
zero-width place- holder character at index 0. If index was
not a valid character index, the return value is 0 and
*xPtr, *yPtr, *widthPtr, and *heightPtr are unmodified.
Otherwise, if index did specify a valid, the return value is
non-zero, and *xPtr, *yPtr, *widthPtr, and *heightPtr are
filled with the bounding box information for the character.
If any of xPtr, yPtr, widthPtr, or heightPtr are NULL, the
corresponding value is not calculated or stored.</p>

<p>Tk_DistanceToTextLayout computes the shortest distance
in pixels from the given point (x, y) to the characters in
layout. Newline/return characters and non-displaying space
characters that occur at the end of individual lines in the
text layout are ignored for hit detection pur- poses, but
tab characters are not. The return value is 0 if the point
actually hits the layout. If the point did not hit the
layout then the return value is the distance in pixels from
the point to the layout.</p>

<p>Tk_IntersectTextLayout determines whether a layout lies
entirely inside, entirely outside, or overlaps a given
rectangle. New- line/return characters and non-displaying
space characters that occur at the end of individual lines
in the layout are ignored for intersec- tion calculations.
The return value is -1 if the layout is entirely outside of
the rectangle, 0 if it overlaps, and 1 if it is entirely
inside of the rectangle.</p>

<p>Tk_TextLayoutToPostscript outputs code consisting of a
Postscript array of strings that represent the individual
lines in layout. It is the responsibility of the caller to
take the Postscript array of strings and add some Postscript
function operate on the array to render each of the lines.
The code that represents the Postscript array of strings is
appended to interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>DISPLAY MODEL When measuring a text layout, space
characters that occur at the end of a line are ignored. The
space characters still exist and the insertion point can be
positioned amongst them, but their additional width is
ignored when justifying lines or returning the total width
of a text layout. All end-of-line space characters are
considered to be attached to the right edge of the line;
this behavior is logical for left-justi- fied text and
reasonable for center-justified text, but not very useful
when editing right-justified text. Spaces are considered
variable width characters; the first space that extends past
the edge of the text layout is clipped to the edge, and any
subsequent spaces on the line are considered zero width and
pegged against the edge. Space characters that occur in the
middle of a line of text are not sup- pressed and occupy
their normal space width.</p>

<p>Tab characters are not ignored for measurement
calculations. If wrap- ping is turned on and there are
enough tabs on a line, the next tab will wrap to the
beginning of the next line. There are some possible strange
interactions between tabs and justification; tab positions
are calculated and the line length computed in a
left-justified world, and then the whole resulting line is
shifted so it is centered or right- justified, causing the
tab columns not to align any more.</p>

<p>When wrapping is turned on, lines may wrap at word
breaks (space or tab characters) or newline/returns. A dash
or hyphen character in the mid- dle of a word is not
considered a word break. Tk_ComputeTextLayout always
attempts to place at least one word on each line. If it
cannot because the wrapLength is too small, the word will be
broken and as much as fits placed on the line and the rest
on subsequent line(s). If wrapLength is so small that not
even one character can fit on a given line, the wrapLength
is ignored for that line and one character will be placed on
the line anyhow. When wrapping is turned off, only new-
line/return characters may cause a line break.</p>

<p>When a text layout has been created using an underlined
tkfont, then any space characters that occur at the end of
individual lines, new- lines/returns, and tabs will not be
displayed underlined when Tk_Draw- TextLayout is called,
because those characters are never actually drawn - they are
merely placeholders maintained in the layout.</p>
