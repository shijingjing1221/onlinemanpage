<p>TOC2CUE(1) CDRDAO TOC2CUE(1)</p>

<p>NAME toc2cue - converts a TOC files of cdrdao(1) into a
.cue file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS toc2cue [-v verbosity_level] input_toc_file
output_cue_file</p>

<p>toc2cue [-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION toc2cue converts a TOC file of cdrdao(1)
into a .cue file.</p>

<p>Please note that the resulting cue file is only valid if
the toc-file was created with cdrdao(1) using the commands
read-toc or read-cd. For manually created or edited
toc-files the cue file may not be cor- rect. This program
just checks for the most obvious toc-file features that
cannot be converted to a cue file. Furthermore, if the
toc-file contains audio tracks the byte order of the image
file will be wrong. This will result in static noise when
the cue file is used for record- ing (even with cdrdao(1)
itself).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v verbosity_level Sets the verbosity level to
use, can be a integer between 1 and 3. By default, only
fatal errors are displayed. A verbosity level of 1 shows
warnings, 2 warnings and errors, 3 warnings, errors and
internal errors.</p>

<p>-V Prints the version of toc2cue.</p>
