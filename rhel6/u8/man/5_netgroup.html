<p>NAME netgroup - specify network groups</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The netgroup file defines
&quot;netgroups&quot;, which are sets of (host, user,
domain) tuples, used for permission checking when doing
remote mounts, remote logins and remote shells.</p>

<p>Each line in the file consists of a netgroup name
followed by a by a list of members, where a member is either
another netgroup name, or a triple:</p>

<p>(host, user, domain)</p>

<p>where the host, user, and domain are character strings
for the corre- sponding components. Any of the three fields
can be empty, in which case it specifies a
&quot;wildcard&quot;, or may consist of the string
&quot;-&quot; to specify &quot;no valid value&quot;. The
domain field must either be the local domain name or empty
for the netgroup entry to be used. This field does not limit
the netgroup or provide security. The domain field refers to
the domain in which the triple is valid, not the domain
containing the the trusted host.</p>

<p>A gateway machine should be listed under all possible
hostnames by which it may be recognized:</p>

<p>gateway (server,,) (server-sn,,) (server-bb,,)</p>

<p>The getnetgrent functions should normally be used to
access the net- group database.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/netgroup</p>

<p>SEE ALSO getnetgrent(3), exports(5), makedbm(8),
ypserv(8)</p>

<p>WARNINGS The triple (,,domain) allows all users and
machines trusted access, and has the same effect as the
triple (,,). Use the host and user fields of the triple to
restrict the access correctly to a specific set of mem-
bers.</p>

<p>BUGS The Linux libc5 does not query the /etc/netgroup
file directly, it only querys the NIS server for the groups.
So the netgroup database must be stored in the form of a
hashed dbm database just like the passwd(5) and group(5)
databases.</p>

<p>This manpage mentions getnetgrent(3), but it seems that
manpage hasnt been written yet. Since getnetgrent() is part
of GNU libc it might also be that it is documented in info
format.</p>
