<p>NAME ntdb - A not-so trivial keyword/data database
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ntdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If you have previously used the tdb library
from Samba, much of this will seem familiar, but there are
some API changes which a compiler will warn you about if you
simply replace &acute;tdb&acute; with &acute;ntdb&acute; in
your code! The on-disk format for ntdb is incompatible with
tdb.</p>

<p>tdb&acute;s API was based on gdbm, and ntdb continues
this tradition, with enhancements. A differences guide is
available in the text file lib/ntdb/doc/TDB_porting.txt in
the SAMBA source tree.</p>

<p>NTDB API OVERVIEW The complete API is documented in the
ntdb.h header, which is kept up-to-date and recommended
reading.</p>

<p>Normal usage is to call ntdb_open() to create or open an
ntdb file. ntdb_store() is used to add records, ntdb_fetch()
is used to fetch them. Traversals are supported via callback
(ntdb_traverse()) or iteration (ntdb_firstkey() and
ntdb_nextkey()). Transactions are supported for batching
updates or reads atomically, using ntdb_transaction_start()
and ntdb_transaction_commit().</p>

<p>Use With Talloc ntdb_open() takes an optional linked
list of attributes: in particular you can specify an
alternate allocator (such as talloc):</p>

<p>#include &lt;talloc.h&gt; #include &lt;ntdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>static void *my_alloc(const void *owner, size_t len,
void *priv) { return talloc_size(owner, len); }</p>

<p>static void *my_expand(void *old, size_t newlen, void
*priv) { return talloc_realloc_size(NULL, old, newlen);
}</p>

<p>static void my_free(void *old, void *priv) {
talloc_free(old); }</p>

<p>/* This opens an ntdb file as a talloc object with given
parent. */ struct ntdb_context *ntdb_open_talloc(const void
*parent, const char *filename) { struct ntdb_context *ntdb;
union ntdb_attribute alloc;</p>

<p>alloc.base.attr = NTDB_ATTRIBUTE_ALLOCATOR;
alloc.base.next = NULL; alloc.alloc.alloc = my_alloc;
alloc.alloc.expand = my_expand; alloc.alloc.free =
my_free;</p>

<p>ntdb = ntdb_open(filename, NTDB_DEFAULT, O_RDWR|O_CREAT,
0600, &amp;alloc); if (ntdb) { talloc_steal(parent, ntdb);
talloc_set_name(ntdb, &quot;%s&quot;, filename); } return
ntdb; }</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original tdb software was created by Andrew
Tridgell, and is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is
developed. ntdb was derived from tdb, but mostly rewritten
by Rusty Russell.</p>
