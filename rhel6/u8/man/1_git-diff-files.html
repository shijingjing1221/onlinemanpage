<p>GIT-DIFF-FILES(1) Git Manual GIT-DIFF-FILES(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-diff-files - Compares files in the working tree
and the index</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git diff-files [-q] [-0|-1|-2|-3|-c|--cc]
[&lt;common diff options&gt;] [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Compares the files in the working tree and
the index. When paths are specified, compares only those
named paths. Otherwise all entries in the index are
compared. The output format is the same as for git
diff-index and git diff-tree.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p, -u Generate patch (see section on generating
patches).</p>

<p>-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt; Generate diffs with
&lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the usual three.
Implies -p.</p>

<p>--raw Generate the raw format. This is the default.</p>

<p>--patch-with-raw Synonym for -p --raw.</p>

<p>--patience Generate a diff using the &quot;patience
diff&quot; algorithm.</p>

<p>--stat[=width[,name-width]] Generate a diffstat. You can
override the default output width for 80-column terminal by
--stat=width. The width of the filename part can be
controlled by giving another width to it separated by a
comma.</p>

<p>--numstat Similar to --stat, but shows number of added
and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without
abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For binary
files, outputs two - instead of saying 0 0.</p>

<p>--shortstat Output only the last line of the --stat
format containing total number of modified files, as well as
number of added and deleted lines.</p>

<p>--dirstat[=limit] Output the distribution of relative
amount of changes (number of lines added or removed) for
each sub-directory. Directories with changes below a cut-off
percent (3% by default) are not shown. The cut-off percent
can be set with --dirstat=limit. Changes in a child
directory is not counted for the parent directory, unless
--cumulative is used.</p>

<p>--dirstat-by-file[=limit] Same as --dirstat, but counts
changed files instead of lines.</p>

<p>--summary Output a condensed summary of extended header
information such as creations, renames and mode changes.</p>

<p>--patch-with-stat Synonym for -p --stat.</p>

<p>-z When --raw, --numstat, --name-only or --name-status
has been given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as
output field terminators.</p>

<p>Without this option, each pathname output will have TAB,
LF, double quotes, and backslash characters replaced with ,
0 respectively, and the pathname will be enclosed in double
quotes if any of those replacements occurred.</p>

<p>--name-only Show only names of changed files.</p>

<p>--name-status Show only names and status of changed
files. See the description of the --diff-filter option on
what the status letters mean.</p>

<p>--submodule[=&lt;format&gt;] Chose the output format for
submodule differences. &lt;format&gt; can be one of short
and log. short just shows pairs of commit names, this format
is used when this option is not given. log is the default
value for this option and lists the commits in that commit
range like the summary option of git-submodule(1) does.</p>

<p>--color[=&lt;when&gt;] Show colored diff. The value must
be always (the default), never, or auto.</p>

<p>--no-color Turn off colored diff, even when the
configuration file gives the default to color output. Same
as --color=never.</p>

<p>--color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;] Show colored word diff,
i.e., color words which have changed. By default, words are
separated by whitespace.</p>

<p>When a &lt;regex&gt; is specified, every non-overlapping
match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a word. Anything
between these matches is considered whitespace and
ignored(!) for the purposes of finding differences. You may
want to append |[^[:space:]] to your regular expression to
make sure that it matches all non-whitespace characters. A
match that contains a newline is silently truncated(!) at
the newline.</p>

<p>The regex can also be set via a diff driver or
configuration option, see gitattributes(1) or git-config(1).
Giving it explicitly overrides any diff driver or
configuration setting. Diff drivers override configuration
settings.</p>

<p>--no-renames Turn off rename detection, even when the
configuration file gives the default to do so.</p>

<p>--check Warn if changes introduce trailing whitespace or
an indent that uses a space before a tab. Exits with
non-zero status if problems are found. Not compatible with
--exit-code.</p>

<p>--full-index Instead of the first handful of characters,
show the full pre- and post-image blob object names on the
&quot;index&quot; line when generating patch format
output.</p>

<p>--binary In addition to --full-index, output a binary
diff that can be applied with git-apply.</p>

<p>--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] Instead of showing the full 40-byte
hexadecimal object name in diff-raw format output and
diff-tree header lines, show only a partial prefix. This is
independent of the --full-index option above, which controls
the diff-patch output format. Non default number of digits
can be specified with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p>-B Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete
and create.</p>

<p>-M Detect renames.</p>

<p>-C Detect copies as well as renames. See also
--find-copies-harder.</p>

<p>--diff-filter=[ACDMRTUXB*] Select only files that are
Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D), Modified (M), Renamed
(R), have their type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule,
...) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have
had their pairing Broken (B). Any combination of the filter
characters may be used. When * (All-or-none) is added to the
combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is
no file that matches other criteria, nothing is
selected.</p>

<p>--find-copies-harder For performance reasons, by
default, -C option finds copies only if the original file of
the copy was modified in the same changeset. This flag makes
the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the
source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large
projects, so use it with caution. Giving more than one -C
option has the same effect.</p>

<p>-l&lt;num&gt; The -M and -C options require O(n^2)
processing time where n is the number of potential
rename/copy targets. This option prevents rename/copy
detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets
exceeds the specified number.</p>

<p>-S&lt;string&gt; Look for differences that introduce or
remove an instance of &lt;string&gt;. Note that this is
different than the string simply appearing in diff output;
see the pickaxe entry in gitdiffcore(7) for more
details.</p>

<p>--pickaxe-all When -S finds a change, show all the
changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain
the change in &lt;string&gt;.</p>

<p>--pickaxe-regex Make the &lt;string&gt; not a plain
string but an extended POSIX regex to match.</p>

<p>-O&lt;orderfile&gt; Output the patch in the order
specified in the &lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob
pattern per line.</p>

<p>-R Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index
or on-disk file to tree contents.</p>

<p>--relative[=&lt;path&gt;] When run from a subdirectory
of the project, it can be told to exclude changes outside
the directory and show pathnames relative to it with this
option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the
output relative to by giving a &lt;path&gt; as an
argument.</p>

<p>-a, --text Treat all files as text.</p>

<p>--ignore-space-at-eol Ignore changes in whitespace at
EOL.</p>

<p>-b, --ignore-space-change Ignore changes in amount of
whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line end, and
considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p>-w, --ignore-all-space Ignore whitespace when comparing
lines. This ignores differences even if one line has
whitespace where the other line has none.</p>

<p>--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt; Show the context
between diff hunks, up to the specified number of lines,
thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.</p>

<p>--exit-code Make the program exit with codes similar to
diff(1). That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences
and 0 means no differences.</p>

<p>--quiet Disable all output of the program. Implies
--exit-code.</p>

<p>--ext-diff Allow an external diff helper to be executed.
If you set an external diff driver with gitattributes(5),
you need to use this option with git-log(1) and friends.</p>

<p>--no-ext-diff Disallow external diff drivers.</p>

<p>--ignore-submodules Ignore changes to submodules in the
diff generation.</p>

<p>--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; Show the given source prefix
instead of &quot;a/&quot;.</p>

<p>--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; Show the given destination
prefix instead of &quot;b/&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-prefix Do not show any source or destination
prefix.</p>

<p>For more detailed explanation on these common options,
see also gitdiffcore(7).</p>

<p>-1 --base, -2 --ours, -3 --theirs, -0 Diff against the
&quot;base&quot; version, &quot;our branch&quot; or
&quot;their branch&quot; respectively. With these options,
diffs for merged entries are not shown.</p>

<p>The default is to diff against our branch (-2) and the
cleanly resolved paths. The option -0 can be given to omit
diff output for unmerged entries and just show
&quot;Unmerged&quot;.</p>

<p>-c, --cc This compares stage 2 (our branch), stage 3
(their branch) and the working tree file and outputs a
combined diff, similar to the way diff-tree shows a merge
commit with these flags.</p>

<p>-q Remain silent even on nonexistent files</p>

<p>RAW OUTPUT FORMAT The raw output format from
&quot;git-diff-index&quot;, &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;,
&quot;git-diff-files&quot; and &quot;git diff --raw&quot;
are very similar.</p>

<p>These commands all compare two sets of things; what is
compared differs:</p>

<p>git-diff-index &lt;tree-ish&gt; compares the
&lt;tree-ish&gt; and the files on the filesystem.</p>

<p>git-diff-index --cached &lt;tree-ish&gt; compares the
&lt;tree-ish&gt; and the index.</p>

<p>git-diff-tree [-r] &lt;tree-ish-1&gt; &lt;tree-ish-2&gt;
[&lt;pattern&gt;...] compares the trees named by the two
arguments.</p>

<p>git-diff-files [&lt;pattern&gt;...] compares the index
and the files on the filesystem.</p>

<p>The &quot;git-diff-tree&quot; command begins its output
by printing the hash of what is being compared. After that,
all the commands print one output line per changed file.</p>

<p>An output line is formatted this way:</p>

<p>in-place edit :100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M
file0 copy-edit :100644 100644 abcd123... 1234567... C68
file1 file2 rename-edit :100644 100644 abcd123... 1234567...
R86 file1 file3 create :000000 100644 0000000... 1234567...
A file4 delete :100644 000000 1234567... 0000000... D file5
unmerged :000000 000000 0000000... 0000000... U file6</p>

<p>That is, from the left to the right:</p>

<p>1. a colon.</p>

<p>2. mode for &quot;src&quot;; 000000 if creation or
unmerged.</p>

<p>3. a space.</p>

<p>4. mode for &quot;dst&quot;; 000000 if deletion or
unmerged.</p>

<p>5. a space.</p>

<p>6. sha1 for &quot;src&quot;; 0{40} if creation or
unmerged.</p>

<p>7. a space.</p>

<p>8. sha1 for &quot;dst&quot;; 0{40} if creation, unmerged
or &quot;look at work tree&quot;.</p>

<p>9. a space.</p>

<p>10. status, followed by optional &quot;score&quot;
number.</p>

<p>11. a tab or a NUL when -z option is used.</p>

<p>12. path for &quot;src&quot;</p>

<p>13. a tab or a NUL when -z option is used; only exists
for C or R.</p>

<p>14. path for &quot;dst&quot;; only exists for C or
R.</p>

<p>15. an LF or a NUL when -z option is used, to terminate
the record.</p>

<p>Possible status letters are:</p>

<p>&middot; A: addition of a file</p>

<p>&middot; C: copy of a file into a new one</p>

<p>&middot; D: deletion of a file</p>

<p>&middot; M: modification of the contents or mode of a
file</p>

<p>&middot; R: renaming of a file</p>

<p>&middot; T: change in the type of the file</p>

<p>&middot; U: file is unmerged (you must complete the
merge before it can be committed)</p>

<p>&middot; X: &quot;unknown&quot; change type (most
probably a bug, please report it)</p>

<p>Status letters C and R are always followed by a score
(denoting the percentage of similarity between the source
and target of the move or copy), and are the only ones to be
so.</p>

<p>&lt;sha1&gt; is shown as all 0 s if a file is new on the
filesystem and it is out of sync with the index.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>:100644 100644 5be4a4...... 000000...... M file.c</p>

<p>When -z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash
characters in pathnames are represented as , 0 and \,
respectively.</p>

<p>DIFF FORMAT FOR MERGES &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;,
&quot;git-diff-files&quot; and &quot;git-diff --raw&quot;
can take -c or --cc option to generate diff output also for
merge commits. The output differs from the format described
above in the following way:</p>

<p>1. there is a colon for each parent</p>

<p>2. there are more &quot;src&quot; modes and
&quot;src&quot; sha1</p>

<p>3. status is concatenated status characters for each
parent</p>

<p>4. no optional &quot;score&quot; number</p>

<p>5. single path, only for &quot;dst&quot;</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>::100644 100644 100644 fabadb8... cc95eb0... 4866510...
MM describe.c</p>

<p>Note that combined diff lists only files which were
modified from all parents.</p>

<p>GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P When
&quot;git-diff-index&quot;, &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;, or
&quot;git-diff-files&quot; are run with a -p option,
&quot;git diff&quot; without the --raw option, or &quot;git
log&quot; with the &quot;-p&quot; option, they do not
produce the output described above; instead they produce a
patch file. You can customize the creation of such patches
via the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment
variables.</p>

<p>What the -p option produces is slightly different from
the traditional diff format.</p>

<p>1. It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header,
that looks like this:</p>

<p>diff --git a/file1 b/file2</p>

<p>The a/ and b/ filenames are the same unless rename/copy
is involved. Especially, even for a creation or a deletion,
/dev/null is not used in place of a/ or b/ filenames.</p>

<p>When rename/copy is involved, file1 and file2 show the
name of the source file of the rename/copy and the name of
the file that rename/copy produces, respectively.</p>

<p>2. It is followed by one or more extended header
lines:</p>

<p>old mode &lt;mode&gt; new mode &lt;mode&gt; deleted file
mode &lt;mode&gt; new file mode &lt;mode&gt; copy from
&lt;path&gt; copy to &lt;path&gt; rename from &lt;path&gt;
rename to &lt;path&gt; similarity index &lt;number&gt;
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt; index
&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p>3. TAB, LF, double quote and backslash characters in
pathnames are represented as , 0 for such substitution then
the whole pathname is put in double quotes.</p>

<p>The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged
lines, and the dissimilarity index is the percentage of
changed lines. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a
percent sign. The similarity index value of 100% is thus
reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means
that no line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>

<p>COMBINED DIFF FORMAT &quot;git-diff-tree&quot;,
&quot;git-diff-files&quot; and &quot;git-diff&quot; can take
-c or --cc option to produce combined diff. For showing a
merge commit with &quot;git log -p&quot;, this is the
default format; you can force showing full diff with the -m
option. A combined diff format looks like this:</p>

<p>diff --combined describe.c index
fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510 --- a/describe.c +++ b/describe.c
@@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@ return (a_date &gt; b_date) ?
-1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 : 1; }</p>

<p>- static void describe(char *arg) -static void
describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one) ++static void
describe(char *arg, int last_one) { + unsigned char
sha1[20]; + struct commit *cmit; struct commit_list *list;
static int initialized = 0; struct commit_name *n;</p>

<p>+ if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) &lt; 0) +
usage(describe_usage); + cmit =
lookup_commit_reference(sha1); + if (!cmit) +
usage(describe_usage); + if (!initialized) { initialized =
1; for_each_ref(get_name);</p>

<p>1. It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header,
that looks like this (when -c option is used):</p>

<p>diff --combined file</p>

<p>or like this (when --cc option is used):</p>

<p>diff --cc file</p>

<p>2. It is followed by one or more extended header lines
(this example shows a merge with two parents):</p>

<p>index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; mode
&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; new file mode
&lt;mode&gt; deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p>The mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; line
appears only if at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is
different from the rest. Extended headers with information
about detected contents movement (renames and copying
detection) are designed to work with diff of two
&lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined diff
format.</p>

<p>3. It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file
header</p>

<p>--- a/file +++ b/file</p>

<p>Similar to two-line header for traditional unified diff
format, /dev/null is used to signal created or deleted
files.</p>

<p>4. Chunk header format is modified to prevent people
from accidentally feeding it to patch -p1. Combined diff
format was created for review of merge commit changes, and
was not meant for apply. The change is similar to the change
in the extended index header:</p>

<p>@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt;
&lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@</p>

<p>There are (number of parents + 1) @ characters in the
chunk header for combined diff format.</p>

<p>Unlike the traditional unified diff format, which shows
two files A and B with a single column that has - (minus
appears in A but removed in B), + (plus missing in A but
added to B), or &quot; &quot; (space unchanged) prefix, this
format compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one
file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN. One
column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to
note how Xs line is different from it.</p>

<p>A - character in the column N means that the line
appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result. A +
character in the column N means that the line appears in the
result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words,
the line was added, from the point of view of that
parent).</p>

<p>In the above example output, the function signature was
changed from both files (hence two - removals from both
file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean one line that was added
does not appear in either file1 nor file2). Also eight other
lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2
(hence prefixed with +).</p>

<p>When shown by git diff-tree -c, it compares the parents
of a merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN
are the parents). When shown by git diff-files -c, it
compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working
tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our
version&quot;, file2 is stage 3 aka &quot;their
version&quot;).</p>

<p>OTHER DIFF FORMATS The --summary option describes newly
added, deleted, renamed and copied files. The --stat option
adds diffstat(1) graph to the output. These options can be
combined with other options, such as -p, and are meant for
human consumption.</p>

<p>When showing a change that involves a rename or a copy,
--stat output formats the pathnames compactly by combining
common prefix and suffix of the pathnames. For example, a
change that moves arch/i386/Makefile to arch/x86/Makefile
while modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:</p>

<p>arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile | 4 +--</p>

<p>The --numstat option gives the diffstat(1) information
but is designed for easier machine consumption. An entry in
--numstat output looks like this:</p>

<p>1 2 README 3 1 arch/{i386 =&gt; x86}/Makefile</p>

<p>That is, from left to right:</p>

<p>1. the number of added lines;</p>

<p>2. a tab;</p>

<p>3. the number of deleted lines;</p>

<p>4. a tab;</p>

<p>5. pathname (possibly with rename/copy information);</p>

<p>6. a newline.</p>

<p>When -z output option is in effect, the output is
formatted this way:</p>

<p>1 2 README NUL 3 1 NUL arch/i386/Makefile NUL
arch/x86/Makefile NUL</p>

<p>That is:</p>

<p>1. the number of added lines;</p>

<p>2. a tab;</p>

<p>3. the number of deleted lines;</p>

<p>4. a tab;</p>

<p>5. a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</p>

<p>6. pathname in preimage;</p>

<p>7. a NUL (only exists if renamed/copied);</p>

<p>8. pathname in postimage (only exists if
renamed/copied);</p>

<p>9. a NUL.</p>

<p>The extra NUL before the preimage path in renamed case
is to allow scripts that read the output to tell if the
current record being read is a single-path record or a
rename/copy record without reading ahead. After reading
added and deleted lines, reading up to NUL would yield the
pathname, but if that is NUL, the record will show two
paths.</p>
