<p>LOGGER(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LOGGER(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME logger - log messages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS logger string ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The logger utility saves a message, in an
unspecified manner and for- mat, containing the string
operands provided by the user. The messages are expected to
be evaluated later by personnel performing system
administration tasks.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined whether messages written in
locales other than the POSIX locale are effective.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>string One of the string arguments whose contents are
concatenated together, in the order specified, separated by
single &lt;space&gt;s.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of log- ger:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error. (This means diagnostics from
logger to the user or application, not diagnostic messages
that the user is sending to the system administrator.)</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES Unspecified.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This utility allows logging of
information for later use by a system administrator or
programmer in determining why non-interactive utili- ties
have failed. The locations of the saved messages, their
format, and retention period are all unspecified. There is
no method for a conforming application to read messages,
once written.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A batch application, running non-interactively,
tries to read a config- uration file and fails; it may
attempt to notify the system administra- tor with:</p>

<p>logger myname: unable to read file foo. [timestamp]</p>

<p>RATIONALE The standard developers believed strongly that
some method of alerting administrators to errors was
necessary. The obvious example is a batch utility, running
non-interactively, that is unable to read its configu-
ration files or that is unable to create or write its
results file. However, the standard developers did not wish
to define the format or delivery mechanisms as they have
historically been (and will probably continue to be) very
system-specific, as well as involving functional- ity
clearly outside the scope of this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The text with LC_MESSAGES about diagnostic messages
means diagnostics from logger to the user or application,
not diagnostic messages that the user is sending to the
system administrator.</p>

<p>Multiple string arguments are allowed, similar to echo,
for ease-of- use.</p>

<p>Like the utilities mailx and lp, logger is admittedly
difficult to test. This was not deemed sufficient
justification to exclude these utilities from this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. It is also arguable that they are, in
fact, testable, but that the tests themselves are not
portable.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
