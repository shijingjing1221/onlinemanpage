<p>XConfigureWindow(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XConfigureWindow(3)</p>

<p>NAME XConfigureWindow, XMoveWindow, XResizeWindow,
XMoveResizeWindow, XSetWindowBorderWidth, XWindowChanges -
configure windows and window changes structure</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XConfigureWindow(Display *display, Window w,
unsigned value_mask, XWindowChanges *changes);</p>

<p>int XMoveWindow(Display *display, Window w, int x,
y);</p>

<p>int XResizeWindow(Display *display, Window w, unsigned
width, unsigned height);</p>

<p>int XMoveResizeWindow(Display *display, Window w, int x,
int y, unsigned width, unsigned height);</p>

<p>int XSetWindowBorderWidth(Display *display, Window w,
unsigned width);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>value_mask Specifies which values are to be set using
information in the values structure. This mask is the
bitwise inclusive OR of the valid configure window values
bits.</p>

<p>values Specifies the XWindowChanges structure.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window to be reconfigured, moved, or
resized..</p>

<p>width Specifies the width of the window border.</p>

<p>width height Specify the width and height, which are the
interior dimen- sions of the window.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates, which define the
new loca- tion of the top-left pixel of the windows border
or the win- dow itself if it has no border or define the new
position of the window relative to its parent.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XConfigureWindow function uses the
values specified in the XWin- dowChanges structure to
reconfigure a window s size, position, border, and stacking
order. Values not specified are taken from the existing
geometry of the window.</p>

<p>If a sibling is specified without a stack_mode or if the
window is not actually a sibling, a BadMatch error results.
Note that the computa- tions for BottomIf, TopIf, and
Opposite are performed with respect to the window s final
geometry (as controlled by the other arguments passed to
XConfigureWindow), not its initial geometry. Any backing
store contents of the window, its inferiors, and other newly
visible windows are either discarded or changed to reflect
the current screen contents (depending on the
implementation).</p>

<p>XConfigureWindow can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XMoveWindow function moves the specified window to
the specified x and y coordinates, but it does not change
the windows size, raise the window, or change the mapping
state of the window. Moving a mapped window may or may not
lose the windows contents depending on if the window is
obscured by nonchildren and if no backing store exists. If
the contents of the window are lost, the X server generates
Expose events. Moving a mapped window generates Expose
events on any formerly obscured windows.</p>

<p>If the override-redirect flag of the window is False and
some other client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on
the parent, the X server generates a ConfigureRequest event,
and no further processing is performed. Otherwise, the
window is moved.</p>

<p>XMoveWindow can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XResizeWindow function changes the inside dimensions
of the speci- fied window, not including its borders. This
function does not change the windows upper-left coordinate
or the origin and does not restack the window. Changing the
size of a mapped window may lose its contents and generate
Expose events. If a mapped window is made smaller, chang-
ing its size generates Expose events on windows that the
mapped window formerly obscured.</p>

<p>If the override-redirect flag of the window is False and
some other client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on
the parent, the X server generates a ConfigureRequest event,
and no further processing is performed. If either width or
height is zero, a BadValue error results.</p>

<p>XResizeWindow can generate BadValue and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XMoveResizeWindow function changes the size and
location of the specified window without raising it. Moving
and resizing a mapped win- dow may generate an Expose event
on the window. Depending on the new size and location
parameters, moving and resizing a window may generate Expose
events on windows that the window formerly obscured.</p>

<p>If the override-redirect flag of the window is False and
some other client has selected SubstructureRedirectMask on
the parent, the X server generates a ConfigureRequest event,
and no further processing is performed. Otherwise, the
window size and location are changed.</p>

<p>XMoveResizeWindow can generate BadValue and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XSetWindowBorderWidth function sets the specified
windows border width to the specified width.</p>

<p>XSetWindowBorderWidth can generate a BadWindow
error.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XWindowChanges structure contains:</p>

<p>/* Configure window value mask bits */</p>

<p>#define CWX (1&lt;&lt;0) #define CWY (1&lt;&lt;1)
#define CWWidth (1&lt;&lt;2) #define CWHeight (1&lt;&lt;3)
#define CWBorderWidth (1&lt;&lt;4) #define CWSibling
(1&lt;&lt;5) #define CWStackMode (1&lt;&lt;6) /* Values
*/</p>

<p>typedef struct { int x, y; int width, height; int
border_width; Window sibling; int stack_mode; }
XWindowChanges;</p>

<p>The x and y members are used to set the windows x and y
coordinates, which are relative to the parents origin and
indicate the position of the upper-left outer corner of the
window. The width and height mem- bers are used to set the
inside size of the window, not including the border, and
must be nonzero, or a BadValue error results. Attempts to
configure a root window have no effect.</p>

<p>The border_width member is used to set the width of the
border in pix- els. Note that setting just the border width
leaves the outer-left corner of the window in a fixed
position but moves the absolute posi- tion of the windows
origin. If you attempt to set the border-width attribute of
an InputOnly window nonzero, a BadMatch error results.</p>

<p>The sibling member is used to set the sibling window for
stacking oper- ations. The stack_mode member is used to set
how the window is to be restacked and can be set to Above,
Below, TopIf, BottomIf, or Opposite.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a
Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
