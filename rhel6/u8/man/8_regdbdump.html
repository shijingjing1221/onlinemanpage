<p>NAME regdbdump - parse and print out regulatory rules
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS regdbdump &lt;path-to-regulatory.bin&gt;</p>

<p>Description regdbdump can be used to parse the
regulatory.bin file, the Linux wire- less regulatory
database used by crda, and print out its contents in human
readable format. regdbdump will return non zero if the
digital signature regdbdump was built with cannot verify the
signature of the regulatory database. Should this happen
unintentionally chances are your regulatory.bin file is
corrupted or has been tampered with.</p>
