<p>GENISOIMAGE(1) GENISOIMAGE(1)</p>

<p>NAME genisoimage - create ISO9660/Joliet/HFS filesystem
with optional Rock Ridge attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS genisoimage [options] [-o filename] pathspec
[pathspec ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION genisoimage is a pre-mastering program to
generate ISO9660/Joliet/HFS hybrid filesystems.</p>

<p>genisoimage is capable of generating the System Use
Sharing Protocol records (SUSP) specified by the Rock Ridge
Interchange Protocol. This is used to further describe the
files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a Unix host, and provides
information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX
permissions, symbolic links, and block and character device
files.</p>

<p>If Joliet or HFS hybrid command line options are
specified, genisoimage will create the additional filesystem
metadata needed for Joliet or HFS. Otherwise genisoimage
will generate a pure ISO9660 filesystem.</p>

<p>genisoimage can generate a true (or shared) HFS hybrid
filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when
accessed from a Macintosh and as ISO9660 files when accessed
from other machines. HFS stands for Hierar- chical File
System and is the native filesystem used on Macintosh com-
puters.</p>

<p>As an alternative, genisoimage can generate the Apple
Extensions to ISO9660 for each file. These extensions
provide each file with CREATOR, TYPE and certain Finder
flags when accessed from a Macintosh. See the HFS MACINTOSH
FILE FORMATS section below.</p>

<p>genisoimage takes a snapshot of a given directory tree,
and generates a binary image which will correspond to an
ISO9660 and/or HFS filesystem when written to a block
device.</p>

<p>Each file written to the ISO9660 filesystem must have a
filename in the 8.3 format (up to 8 characters, period, up
to 3 characters, all upper- case), even if Rock Ridge is in
use. This filename is used on systems that are not able to
make use of the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS- DOS), and
each filename in each directory must be different from the
other filenames in the same directory. genisoimage generally
tries to form correct names by forcing the Unix filename to
uppercase and trun- cating as required, but often this
yields unsatisfactory results when the truncated names are
not all unique. genisoimage assigns weightings to each
filename, and if two names that are otherwise the same are
found, the name with the lower priority is renamed to
include a 3-digit number (guaranteed to be unique). For
example, the two files foo.bar and foo.bar.~1~ could be
rendered as FOO.BAR;1 and FOO000.BAR;1.</p>

<p>When used with various HFS options, genisoimage will
attempt to recog- nise files stored in a number of
Apple/Unix file formats and will copy the data and resource
forks as well as any relevant Finder information. See the
HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS section below for more about
formats genisoimage supports.</p>

<p>Note that genisoimage is not designed to communicate
with the writer directly. Most writers have proprietary
command sets which vary from one manufacturer to another,
and you need a specialized tool to actu- ally burn the disc.
wodim is one such tool. The latest version of wodim is
available from http://www.cdrkit.org/.</p>

<p>pathspec is the path of the directory tree to be copied
into the ISO9660 filesystem. Multiple paths can be
specified, and genisoimage will merge the files found in all
of the specified path components to form the filesystem
image.</p>

<p>If the option -graft-points has been specified, it is
possible to graft the paths at points other than the root
directory, and it is possible to graft files or directories
onto the cdrom image with names different than what they
have in the source filesystem. This is easiest to illustrate
with a couple of examples. Let s start by assuming that a
local file ../old.lis exists, and you wish to include it in
the cdrom image.</p>

<p>foo/bar/=../old.lis</p>

<p>will include old.lis in the cdrom image at
/foo/bar/old.lis, while</p>

<p>foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis</p>

<p>will include old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/xxx.
The same sort of syntax can be used with directories as
well. genisoimage will cre- ate any directories required
such that the graft points exist on the cdrom image the
directories do not need to appear in one of the paths. By
default, any directories that are created on the fly like
this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by
the person running genisoimage. If you wish other
permissions or owners of the intermediate directories, see
-uid, -gid, -dir-mode, -file-mode and -new-dir-mode.</p>

<p>genisoimage will also run on Windows machines when
compiled with Cygnus cygwin (available from
http://www.cygwin.com/). Therefore most references in this
man page to Unix can be replaced with Win32.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Several options can be specified as defaults in
a .genisoimagerc con- figuration file, as well as on the
command line. If a parameter is specified in both places,
the setting from the command line is used. For details on
the format and possible locations of this file, see
genisoimagerc(5).</p>

<p>-abstract file Specifies the abstract filename. There is
space for 37 charac- ters. Equivalent to ABST in the
.genisoimagerc file.</p>

<p>-A application_id Specifies a text string that will be
written into the volume header. This should describe the
application that will be on the disc. There is space for 128
characters. Equivalent to APPI in the .genisoimagerc
file.</p>

<p>-allow-limited-size When processing files larger than
2GiB which cannot be easily represented in ISO9660, add them
with a shrunk visible file size to ISO9660 and with the
correct visible file size to the UDF system. The result is
an inconsistent filesystem and users need to make sure that
they really use UDF rather than ISO9660 driver to read a
such disk. Implies enabling -udf.</p>

<p>-allow-leading-dots</p>

<p>-ldots Allow ISO9660 filenames to begin with a period.
Usually, a leading dot is replaced with an underscore in
order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility. This violates the
ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.</p>

<p>-allow-lowercase This options allows lowercase
characters to appear in ISO9660 filenames. This violates the
ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on some systems.
Use with caution.</p>

<p>-allow-multidot This options allows more than one dot to
appear in ISO9660 file- names. A leading dot is not affected
by this option, it may be allowed separately using
-allow-leading-dots. This violates the ISO9660 standard, but
it happens to work on many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p>-biblio file Specifies the bibliographic filename. There
is space for 37 characters. Equivalent to BIBL in the
.genisoimagerc file.</p>

<p>-cache-inodes</p>

<p>-no-cache-inodes Enable or disable caching inode and
device numbers to find hard links to files. If genisoimage
finds a hard link (a file with multiple names), the file
will also be hard-linked on the CD, so the file contents
only appear once. This helps to save space. -cache-inodes is
default on Unix-like operating systems, but -no-cache-inodes
is default on some other systems such as Cyg- win, because
it is not safe to assume that inode numbers are unique on
those systems. (Some versions of Cygwin create fake inode
numbers using a weak hashing algorithm, which may produce
duplicates.) If two files have the same inode number but are
not hard links to the same file, genisoimage -cache-inodes
will not behave correctly. -no-cache-inodes is safe in all
situa- tions, but in that case genisoimage cannot detect
hard links, so the resulting CD image may be larger than
necessary.</p>

<p>-alpha-boot alpha_boot_image Specifies the path and
filename of the boot image to be used when making an
Alpha/SRM bootable CD. The pathname must be rela- tive to
the source path specified to genisoimage.</p>

<p>-hppa-bootloader hppa_bootloader_image Specifies the
path and filename of the boot image to be used when making
an HPPA bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the
source path specified to genisoimage. Other options are
required, at the very least a kernel filename and a boot
command line. See the HPPA NOTES section below for more
information.</p>

<p>-hppa-cmdline hppa_boot_command_line Specifies the
command line to be passed to the HPPA boot loader when
making a bootable CD. Separate the parameters with spaces or
commas. More options must be passed to genisoimage, at the
very least a kernel filename and the boot loader filename.
See the HPPA NOTES section below for more information.</p>

<p>-hppa-kernel-32 hppa_kernel_32</p>

<p>-hppa-kernel-64 hppa_kernel_64 Specifies the path and
filename of the 32-bit and/or 64-bit ker- nel images to be
used when making an HPPA bootable CD. The path- names must
be relative to the source path specified to genisoim- age.
Other options are required, at the very least the boot
loader filename and the boot command line. See the HPPA
NOTES section below for more information.</p>

<p>-hppa-ramdisk hppa_ramdisk_image Specifies the path and
filename of the ramdisk image to be used when making an HPPA
bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to genisoimage. This parameter is optional.
Other options are required, at the very least a ker- nel
filename and the boot command line. See the HPPA NOTES sec-
tion below for more information.</p>

<p>-mips-boot mips_boot_image Specifies the path and
filename of the boot image to be used when making an
SGI/big-endian MIPS bootable CD. The pathname must be
relative to the source path specified to genisoimage. This
option may be specified several times, to store up to 15
boot images.</p>

<p>-mipsel-boot mipsel_boot_image Specifies the path and
filename of the boot image to be used when making an
DEC/little-endian MIPS bootable CD. The pathname must be
relative to the source path specified to genisoimage.</p>

<p>-B img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e</p>

<p>-sparc-boot
img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e Specifies a
comma-separated list of boot images that are needed to make
a bootable CD for SPARC systems. Partition 0 is used for the
ISO9660 image, the first image file is mapped to parti- tion
1. The comma-separated list may have up to 7 fields,
including empty fields. This option is required to make a
bootable CD for Sun SPARC systems. If -B or -sparc-boot has
been specified, the first sector of the resulting image will
contain a Sun disk label. This disk label specifies slice 0
for the ISO9660 image and slices 1 to 7 for the boot images
that have been specified with this option. Byte offsets 512
to 8191 within each of the additional boot images must
contain a primary boot that works for the appropriate SPARC
architecture. The rest of each of the images usually
contains a UFS filesystem used for the primary kernel boot
stage.</p>

<p>The implemented boot method is the one found with SunOS
4.x and SunOS 5.x. However, it does not depend on SunOS
internals but only on properties of the Open Boot prom, so
it should be usable for any OS for SPARC systems. For more
information also see the NOTES section below.</p>

<p>If the special filename ... is used, the actual and all
follow- ing boot partitions are mapped to the previous
partition. If genisoimage is called with -G image -B ... all
boot partitions are mapped to the partition that contains
the ISO9660 filesystem image and the generic boot image that
is located in the first 16 sectors of the disc is used for
all architectures.</p>

<p>-G generic_boot_image Specifies the path and filename of
the generic boot image to be used when making a generic
bootable CD. The boot image will be placed on the first 16
sectors of the CD, before the ISO9660 primary volume
descriptor. If this option is used together with
-sparc-boot, the Sun disk label will overlay the first 512
bytes of the generic boot image.</p>

<p>-b eltorito_boot_image Specifies the path and filename
of the boot image to be used when making an El Torito
bootable CD for x86 PCs. The pathname must be relative to
the source path specified to genisoimage. This option is
required to make an El Torito bootable CD. The boot image
must be exactly 1200 kB, 1440 kB or 2880 kB, and genisoimage
will use this size when creating the output ISO9660
filesystem. The PC BIOS will use the image to emulate a
floppy disk, so the first 512-byte sector should contain PC
boot code. This will work, for example, if the boot image is
a LILO-based boot floppy.</p>

<p>If the boot image is not an image of a floppy, you need
to add either -hard-disk-boot or -no-emul-boot. If the
system should not boot off the emulated disk, use
-no-boot.</p>

<p>If -sort has not been specified, the boot images are
sorted with low priority (+2) to the beginning of the
medium. If you dont like this, you need to specify a sort
weight of 0 for the boot images.</p>

<p>-eltorito-alt-boot Start with a new set of El Torito
boot parameters. Up to 63 El Torito boot entries may be
stored on a single CD.</p>

<p>-hard-disk-boot Specifies that the boot image used to
create El Torito bootable CDs is a hard disk image. The
image must begin with a master boot record that contains a
single partition.</p>

<p>-no-emul-boot Specifies that the boot image used to
create El Torito bootable CDs is a &quot;no emulation&quot;
image. The system will load and execute this image without
performing any disk emulation.</p>

<p>-no-boot Specifies that the created El Torito CD should
be marked as not bootable. The system will provide an
emulated drive for the image, but will boot off a standard
boot device.</p>

<p>-boot-load-seg segment_address Specifies the load
segment address of the boot image for no-emu- lation El
Torito CDs.</p>

<p>-boot-load-size load_sectors Specifies the number of
&quot;virtual&quot; (512-byte) sectors to load in
no-emulation mode. The default is to load the entire boot
file. Some BIOSes may have problems if this is not a
multiple of 4.</p>

<p>-boot-info-table Specifies that a 56-byte table with
information of the CD-ROM layout will be patched in at
offset 8 in the boot file. If this option is given, the boot
file is modified in the source filesystem, so make a copy of
this file if it cannot be easily regenerated! See the EL
TORITO BOOT INFO TABLE section for a description of this
table.</p>

<p>-C last_sess_start,next_sess_start This option is needed
to create a CD Extra or the image of a second session or a
higher-level session for a multisession disc. -C takes two
numbers separated by a comma. The first is the first sector
in the last session of the disc that should be appended to.
The second number is the starting sector number of the new
session. The correct numbers may be retrieved by call- ing
wodim -msinfo ... If -C is used in conjunction with -M,
genisoimage will create a filesystem image that is intended
to be a continuation of the previous session. If -C is used
with- out -M, genisoimage will create a filesystem image
that is intended to be used for a second session on a CD
Extra. This is a multisession CD that holds audio data in
the first session and an ISO9660 filesystem in the second
session.</p>

<p>-c boot_catalog Specifies the path and filename of the
boot catalog, which is required for an El Torito bootable
CD. The pathname must be rel- ative to the source path
specified to genisoimage. This file will be inserted into
the output tree and not created in the source filesystem, so
be sure the specified filename does not conflict with an
existing file, or it will be excluded. Usually a name like
boot.catalog is chosen.</p>

<p>If -sort has not been specified, the boot catalog sorted
with low priority (+1) to the beginning of the medium. If
you dont like this, you need to specify a sort weight of 0
for the boot catalog.</p>

<p>-check-oldnames Check all filenames imported from the
old session for compliance with the ISO9660 file naming
rules. Without this option, only names longer than 31
characters are checked, as these files are a serious
violation of the ISO9660 standard.</p>

<p>-check-session file Check all old sessions for
compliance with actual genisoimage ISO9660 file naming
rules. This is a high-level option that combines -M file -C
0,0 -check-oldnames. For the parameter file, see the
description of -M.</p>

<p>-copyright file Specifies copyright information,
typically a filename on the disc. There is space for 37
characters. Equivalent to COPY in the .genisoimagerc
file.</p>

<p>-d Do not append a period to files that do not have one.
This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work
on many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p>-D Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead
just pack them in the way we see them. If ISO9660:1999 has
not been selected, this violates the ISO9660 standard, but
it happens to work on many systems. Use with cau- tion.</p>

<p>-dir-mode mode Overrides the mode of directories used to
create the image to mode, specified as 4 digits of
permission bits as in chmod(1). This option automatically
enables Rock Ridge extensions.</p>

<p>-dvd-video Generate a DVD-Video compliant UDF
filesystem. This is done by sorting the order of the content
of the appropriate files and by adding padding between the
files if needed. Note that the sort- ing only works if the
DVD-Video filenames include uppercase characters only.</p>

<p>Note that in order to get a DVD-Video compliant
filesystem image, you need to prepare a DVD-Video compliant
directory tree. This requires a directory VIDEO_TS (all
caps) in the root direc- tory of the resulting DVD, and
usually another directory AUDIO_TS. VIDEO_TS needs to
include all needed files (filenames must be all caps) for a
compliant DVD-Video filesystem.</p>

<p>-f Follow symbolic links when generating the filesystem.
When this option is not in use, symbolic links will be
entered using Rock Ridge if enabled, otherwise they will be
ignored.</p>

<p>-file-mode mode Overrides the mode of regular files used
to create the image to mode, specified as 4 digits of
permission bits as in chmod(1). This option automatically
enables Rock Ridge extensions.</p>

<p>-gid gid Overrides the group ID read from the source
files to the value of gid. Specifying this option
automatically enables Rock Ridge extensions.</p>

<p>-gui Switch the behaviour for a GUI. This currently
makes the output more verbose but may have other effects in
the future.</p>

<p>-graft-points Allow use of graft points for filenames.
If this option is used, all filenames are checked for graft
points. The filename is divided at the first unescaped equal
sign. All occurrences of and = characters must be escaped
with if -graft-points has been specified.</p>

<p>-hide glob Hide any files matching glob, a shell
wildcard pattern, from being seen in the ISO9660 or Rock
Ridge directory. glob may match any part of the filename or
path. If glob matches a directory, the contents of that
directory will be hidden. In order to match a directory
name, make sure the pathname does not include a trailing /
character. All the hidden files will still be written to the
output CD image file. See also -hide-joliet, and
README.hide. This option may be used multiple times.</p>

<p>-hide-list file A file containing a list of shell
wildcards to be hidden. See -hide.</p>

<p>-hidden glob Add the hidden (existence) ISO9660
directory attribute for files and directories matching glob,
a shell wildcard pattern. This attribute will prevent the
files from being shown by some MS-DOS and Windows commands.
glob may match any part of the filename or path. In order to
match a directory name, make sure the pathname does not
include a trailing / character. This option may be used
multiple times.</p>

<p>-hidden-list file A file containing a list of shell
wildcards to get the hidden attribute. See -hidden.</p>

<p>-hide-joliet glob Hide files and directories matching
glob, a shell wildcard pat- tern, from being seen in the
Joliet directory. glob may match any part of the filename or
path. If glob matches a directory, the contents of that
directory will be hidden. In order to match a directory
name, make sure the pathname does not include a trailing /
character. All the hidden files will still be written to the
output CD image file. This option is usually used with
-hide. See also README.hide. This option may be used
multiple times.</p>

<p>-hide-joliet-list file A file containing a list of shell
wildcards to be hidden from the Joliet tree. See
-hide-joliet.</p>

<p>-hide-joliet-trans-tbl Hide the TRANS.TBL files from the
Joliet tree. These files usu- ally dont make sense in the
Joliet world as they list the real name and the ISO9660 name
which may both be different from the Joliet name.</p>

<p>-hide-rr-moved Rename the directory RR_MOVED to
.rr_moved in the Rock Ridge tree. It seems to be impossible
to completely hide the RR_MOVED directory from the Rock
Ridge tree. This option only makes the visible tree less
confusing for people who dont know what this directory is
for. If you need to have no RR_MOVED directory at all, you
should use -D. Note that if -D has been specified, the
resulting filesystem is not ISO9660 level-1 compliant and
will not be readable on MS-DOS. See also the NOTES
section.</p>

<p>-input-charset charset Input charset that defines the
characters used in local file- names. To get a list of valid
charset names, call genisoimage -input-charset help. To get
a 1:1 mapping, you may use default as charset name. The
default initial values are cp437 on DOS- based systems and
iso8859-1 on all other systems. See the CHAR- ACTER SETS
section below for more details.</p>

<p>-output-charset charset Output charset that defines the
characters that will be used in Rock Ridge filenames.
Defaults to the input charset. See CHAR- ACTER SETS section
below for more details.</p>

<p>-iso-level level Set the ISO9660 conformance level.
Valid numbers are 1 to 4.</p>

<p>With level 1, files may only consist of one section and
file- names are restricted to 8.3 characters.</p>

<p>With level 2, files may only consist of one section.</p>

<p>With level 3, no restrictions (other than ISO-9660:1988)
do apply.</p>

<p>With all ISO9660 levels from 1 to 3, all filenames are
restricted to uppercase letters, numbers and underscores
(_). Filenames are limited to 31 characters, directory
nesting is limited to 8 levels, and pathnames are limited to
255 charac- ters.</p>

<p>Level 4 officially does not exist but genisoimage maps
it to ISO-9660:1999, which is ISO9660 version 2.</p>

<p>With level 4, an enhanced volume descriptor with version
number and file structure version number set to 2 is
emitted. Direc- tory nesting is not limited to 8 levels,
there is no need for a file to contain a dot and the dot has
no special meaning, file- names do not have version numbers,
and filenames can be up to 207 characters long, or 197
characters if Rock Ridge is used.</p>

<p>When creating Version 2 images, genisoimage emits an
enhanced volume descriptor, similar but not identical to a
primary volume descriptor. Be careful not to use broken
software to make ISO9660 images bootable by assuming a
second PVD copy and patch- ing this putative PVD copy into
an El Torito VD.</p>

<p>-J Generate Joliet directory records in addition to
regular ISO9660 filenames. This is primarily useful when the
discs are to be used on Windows machines. Joliet filenames
are specified in Unicode and each path component can be up
to 64 Unicode charac- ters long. Note that Joliet is not a
standard only Microsoft Windows and Linux systems can read
Joliet extensions. For greater portability, consider using
both Joliet and Rock Ridge extensions.</p>

<p>-joliet-long Allow Joliet filenames to be up to 103
Unicode characters, instead of 64. This breaks the Joliet
specification, but appears to work. Use with caution.</p>

<p>-jcharset charset A combination of -J -input-charset
charset. See the CHARACTER SETS section below for more
details.</p>

<p>-l Allow full 31-character filenames. Normally the
ISO9660 file- name will be in an 8.3 format which is
compatible with MS-DOS, even though the ISO9660 standard
allows filenames of up to 31 characters. If you use this
option, the disc may be difficult to use on a MS-DOS system,
but will work on most other systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p>-L Outdated option; use -allow-leading-dots instead.</p>

<p>-jigdo-jigdo jigdo_file Produce a jigdo .jigdo metadata
file as well as the filesystem image. See the JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.</p>

<p>-jigdo-template template_file Produce a jigdo .template
file as well as the filesystem image. See the JIGDO NOTES
section below for more information.</p>

<p>-jigdo-min-file-size size Specify the minimum size for a
file to be listed in the .jigdo file. Default (and minimum
allowed) is 1KB. See the JIGDO NOTES section below for more
information.</p>

<p>-jigdo-force-md5 path Specify a file pattern where files
must be contained in the externally-supplied MD5 list as
supplied by -md5-list. See the JIGDO NOTES section below for
more information.</p>

<p>-jigdo-exclude path Specify a file pattern where files
will not be listed in the .jigdo file. See the JIGDO NOTES
section below for more informa- tion.</p>

<p>-jigdo-map path Specify a pattern mapping for the jigdo
file (e.g. Debian=/mir- ror/debian). See the JIGDO NOTES
section below for more infor- mation.</p>

<p>-md5-list md5_file Specify a file containing the
MD5sums, sizes and pathnames of the files to be included in
the .jigdo file. See the JIGDO NOTES section below for more
information.</p>

<p>-jigdo-template-compress algorithm Specify a compression
algorithm to use for template date. gzip and bzip2 are
currently supported, and gzip is the default. See the JIGDO
NOTES section below for more information.</p>

<p>-log-file log_file Redirect all error, warning and
informational messages to log_file instead of the standard
error.</p>

<p>-m glob Exclude files matching glob, a shell wildcard
pattern, from being written to CD-ROM. glob may match either
the filename component or the full pathname. This option may
be used multi- ple times. For example:</p>

<p>genisoimage -o rom -m *.o -m core -m foobar</p>

<p>would exclude all files ending in .o , or called core or
foobar from the image. Note that if you had a directory
called foobar, it too (and of course all its descendants)
would be excluded.</p>

<p>-exclude-list file A file containing a list of shell
wildcards to be excluded. See -m.</p>

<p>-max-iso9660-filenames Allow ISO9660 filenames to be up
to 37 characters long. This option enables -N as the extra
name space is taken from the space reserved for file version
numbers. This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens
to work on many systems. Although a conforming application
needs to pro- vide a buffer space of at least 37 characters,
discs created with this option may cause a buffer overflow
in the reading operating system. Use with extreme care.</p>

<p>-M path</p>

<p>-M device</p>

<p>-dev device Specifies path to existing ISO9660 image to
be merged. The alternate form takes a SCSI device specifier
that uses the same syntax as the dev= parameter of wodim.
The output of genisoim- age will be a new session which
should get written to the end of the image specified in -M.
Typically this requires multisession capability for the CD
recorder used to write the image. This option may only be
used in conjunction with -C.</p>

<p>-N Omit version numbers from ISO9660 filenames. This
violates the ISO9660 standard, but no one really uses the
version numbers anyway. Use with caution.</p>

<p>-new-dir-mode mode Specify the mode, a 4-digit number as
used in chmod(1), to use when creating new directories in
the filesystem image. The default is 0555.</p>

<p>-nobak</p>

<p>-no-bak Exclude backup files files on the ISO9660
filesystem; that is, filenames that contain the characters ~
or # or end in .bak. These are typically backup files for
Unix text editors.</p>

<p>-force-rr Do not use the automatic Rock Ridge attributes
recognition for previous sessions. This can work around
problems with images created by, e.g., NERO Burning ROM.</p>

<p>-no-rr Do not use the Rock Ridge attributes from
previous sessions. This may help to avoid problems when
genisoimage finds illegal Rock Ridge signatures on an old
session.</p>

<p>-no-split-symlink-components Dont split the symlink
components, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE) instead.
This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 cdrom driver
has a bug in reading split symlink compo- nents.</p>

<p>It is questionable whether this option is useful
nowadays.</p>

<p>-no-split-symlink-fields Dont split the symlink fields,
but begin a new Continuation Area (CE) instead. This may
waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 and Solaris 2.5.1
cdrom driver have a bug in reading split symlink fields (a /
can be dropped).</p>

<p>It is questionable whether this option is useful
nowadays.</p>

<p>-o filename Specify the output file for the the ISO9660
filesystem image. This can be a disk file, a tape drive, or
it can correspond directly to the device name of the optical
disc writer. If not specified, stdout is used. Note that the
output can also be a block device for a regular disk
partition, in which case the ISO9660 filesystem can be
mounted normally to verify that it was generated
correctly.</p>

<p>-pad Pad the end of the whole image by 150 sectors (300
kB). This option is enabled by default. If used in
combination with -B, padding is inserted between the ISO9660
partition and the boot partitions, such that the first boot
partition starts on a sec- tor number that is a multiple of
16.</p>

<p>The padding is needed as many operating systems (e.g.
Linux) implement read-ahead bugs in their filesystem I/O.
These bugs result in read errors on files that are located
near the end of a track, particularly if the disc is written
in Track At Once mode, or where a CD audio track follows the
data track.</p>

<p>-no-pad Do not pad the end by 150 sectors (300 kB) and
do not make the the boot partitions start on a multiple of
16 sectors.</p>

<p>-path-list file A file containing a list of pathspec
directories and filenames to be added to the ISO9660
filesystem. This list of pathspecs are processed after any
that appear on the command line. If the argument is -, the
list is read from the standard input.</p>

<p>-P Outdated option; use -publisher instead.</p>

<p>-publisher publisher_id Specifies a text string that
will be written into the volume header. This should describe
the publisher of the CD-ROM, usu- ally with a mailing
address and phone number. There is space for 128 characters.
Equivalent to PUBL in the .genisoimagerc file.</p>

<p>-p preparer_id Specifies a text string that will be
written into the volume header. This should describe the
preparer of the CD-ROM, usu- ally with a mailing address and
phone number. There is space for 128 characters. Equivalent
to PREP in the .genisoimagerc file.</p>

<p>-print-size Print estimated filesystem size in multiples
of the sector size (2048 bytes) and exit. This option is
needed for Disk At Once mode and with some CD-R drives when
piping directly into wodim, cases where wodim needs to know
the size of the filesystem image in advance. Old versions of
mkisofs wrote this information (among other information) to
stderr. As this turns out to be hard to parse, the number
without any other information is now printed on stdout too.
If you like to write a simple shell script, redirect stderr
and catch the number from stdout. This may be done with:</p>

<p>cdblocks= genisoimage -print-size -quiet ... genisoimage
... | wodim ... tsize=${cdblocks}s -</p>

<p>-quiet This makes genisoimage even less verbose. No
progress output will be provided.</p>

<p>-R Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge
protocol to further describe the files on the ISO9660
filesystem.</p>

<p>-r This is like the -R option, but file ownership and
modes are set to more useful values. The uid and gid are set
to zero, because they are usually only useful on the author
s system, and not useful to the client. All the file read
bits are set true, so that files and directories are
globally readable on the client. If any execute bit is set
for a file, set all of the execute bits, so that executables
are globally executable on the client. If any search bit is
set for a directory, set all of the search bits, so that
directories are globally searchable on the client. All write
bits are cleared, because the filesystem will be mounted
read-only in any case. If any of the special mode bits are
set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
read-only filesystem, and set-id bits are not desirable for
uid 0 or gid 0. When used on Win32, the execute bit is set
on all files. This is a result of the lack of file
permissions on Win32 and the Cygwin POSIX emulation layer.
See also -uid, -gid, -dir-mode, -file-mode and
-new-dir-mode.</p>

<p>-relaxed-filenames Allows ISO9660 filenames to include
all 7-bit ASCII characters except lowercase letters. This
violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on
many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p>-root dir Moves all files and directories into dir in
the image. This is essentially the same as using
-graft-points and adding dir in front of every pathspec, but
is easier to use. dir may actually be several levels deep.
It is created with the same permissions as other graft
points.</p>

<p>-old-root dir This option is necessary when writing a
multisession image and the previous (or even older) session
was written with -root dir. Using a directory name not found
in the previous session causes genisoimage to abort with an
error. Without this option, genisoimage would not be able to
find unmodified files and would be forced to write their
data into the image once more. -root and -old-root are meant
to be used together to do incremental backups. The initial
session would e.g. use: genisoimage -root backup_1 dirs. The
next incremental backup with genisoimage -root backup_2
-old-root backup_1 dirs would take another snap- shot of
these directories. The first snapshot would be found in
backup_1, the second one in backup_2, but only modified or
new files need to be written into the second session.
Without these options, new files would be added and old ones
would be pre- served. But old ones would be overwritten if
the file was modi- fied. Recovering the files by copying the
whole directory back from CD would also restore files that
were deleted intention- ally. Accessing several older
versions of a file requires sup- port by the operating
system to choose which sessions are to be mounted.</p>

<p>-sort sort_file Sort file locations on the media.
Sorting is controlled by a file that contains pairs of
filenames and sorting offset weight- ing. If the weighting
is higher, the file will be located closer to the beginning
of the media, if the weighting is lower, the file will be
located closer to the end of the media. There must be only
one space or tabs character between the filename and the
weight and the weight must be the last characters on a line.
The filename is taken to include all the characters up to,
but not including the last space or tab character on a line.
This is to allow for space characters to be in, or at the
end of a filename. This option does not sort the order of
the file- names that appear in the ISO9660 directory. It
sorts the order in which the file data is written to the CD
image, which is use- ful in order to optimize the data
layout on a CD. See README.sort for more details.</p>

<p>-sparc-boot
img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e See -B
above.</p>

<p>-sparc-label label Set the Sun disk label name for the
Sun disk label that is cre- ated with -sparc-boot.</p>

<p>-split-output Split the output image into several files
of approximately 1 GB each. This helps to create DVD-sized
ISO9660 images on operat- ing systems without large file
support. wodim will concatenate more than one file into a
single track if writing to a DVD. To make -split-output
work, -o filename must be specified. The resulting output
images will be named: filename_00, filename_01,
filename_02....</p>

<p>-stream-media-size # Select streaming operation and set
the media size to # sectors. This allows you to pipe the
output of the tar(1) program into genisoimage and to create
an ISO9660 filesystem without the need of an intermediate
tar archive file. If this option has been specified,
genisoimage reads from stdin and creates a file with the
name STREAM.IMG. The maximum size of the file (with padding)
is 200 sectors less than the specified media size. If
-no-pad has been specified, the file size is 50 sectors less
than the specified media size. If the file is smaller,
genisoimage will write padding. This may take awhile.</p>

<p>The option -stream-media-size creates simple ISO9660
filesystems only and may not used together with multisession
or hybrid filesystem options.</p>

<p>-stream-file-name name Reserved for future use.</p>

<p>-sunx86-boot UFS_img,,,AUX1_img Specifies a
comma-separated list of filesystem images that are needed to
make a bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.</p>

<p>Note that partition 1 is used for the ISO9660 image and
that partition 2 is the whole disk, so partition 1 and 2 may
not be used by external partition data. The first image file
is mapped to partition 0. There may be empty fields in the
comma-sepa- rated list, and list entries for partition 1 and
2 must be empty. The maximum number of supported partitions
is 8 (although the Solaris x86 partition table could support
up to 16 partitions), so it is impossible to specify more
than 6 parti- tion images. This option is required to make a
bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.</p>

<p>If -sunx86-boot has been specified, the first sector of
the resulting image will contain a PC fdisk label with a
Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition that starts at offset 512
and spans the whole CD. In addition, for the Solaris type
0x82 fdisk par- tition, there is a SVr4 disk label at offset
1024 in the first sector of the CD. This disk label
specifies slice 0 for the first (usually UFS type)
filesystem image that is used to boot the PC and slice 1 for
the ISO9660 image. Slice 2 spans the whole CD slice 3 ...
slice 7 may be used for additional filesys- tem images that
have been specified with this option.</p>

<p>A Solaris x86 boot CD uses a 1024 byte sized primary
boot that uses the El-Torito no-emulation boot mode and a
secondary generic boot that is in CD sectors 1..15. For this
reason, both -b bootimage -no-emul-boot and -G genboot must
be specified.</p>

<p>-sunx86-label label Set the SVr4 disk label name for the
SVr4 disk label that is created with -sunx86-boot.</p>

<p>-sysid ID Specifies the system ID. There is space for 32
characters. Equivalent to SYSI in the .genisoimagerc
file.</p>

<p>-T Generate a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the
CD-ROM, which can be used on non-Rock Ridge-capable systems
to help establish the correct filenames. There is also
information present in the file that indicates the major and
minor numbers for block and character devices, and each
symlink has the name of the link file given.</p>

<p>-table-name table_name Alternative translation table
filename (see above). Implies -T. If you are creating a
multisession image you must use the same name as in the
previous session.</p>

<p>-ucs-level level Set Unicode conformance level in the
Joliet SVD. The default level is 3. It may be set to 1..3
using this option.</p>

<p>-udf Include UDF filesystem support in the generated
filesystem image. UDF support is currently in alpha status
and for this reason, it is not possible to create UDF-only
images. UDF data structures are currently coupled to the
Joliet structures, so there are many pitfalls with the
current implementation. There is no UID/GID support, there
is no POSIX permission support, there is no support for
symlinks. Note that UDF wastes the space from sector ~20 to
sector 256 at the beginning of the disc in addition to the
space needed for real UDF data structures.</p>

<p>-uid uid Overrides the uid read from the source files to
the value of uid. Specifying this option automatically
enables Rock Ridge extensions.</p>

<p>-use-fileversion The option -use-fileversion allows
genisoimage to use file ver- sion numbers from the
filesystem. If the option is not speci- fied, genisoimage
creates a version number of 1 for all files. File versions
are strings in the range ;1 to ;32767 This option is the
default on VMS.</p>

<p>-U Allows &quot;untranslated&quot; filenames, completely
violating the ISO9660 standards described above. Enables the
following flags: -d -l -N -allow-leading-dots
-relaxed-filenames -allow-lowercase -allow-multidot
-no-iso-translate. Allows more than one . character in the
filename, as well as mixed-case filenames. This is useful on
HP-UX, where the built-in cdfs filesystem does not recognize
any extensions. Use with extreme caution.</p>

<p>-no-iso-translate Do not translate the characters # and
~ which are invalid for ISO9660 filenames. Although invalid,
these characters are often used by Microsoft systems. This
violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on
many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p>-V volid Specifies the volume ID (volume name or label)
to be written into the master block. There is space for 32
characters. Equivalent to VOLI in the .genisoimagerc file.
The volume ID is used as the mount point by the Solaris
volume manager and as a label assigned to a disc on various
other platforms such as Win- dows and Apple Mac OS.</p>

<p>-volset ID Specifies the volume set ID. There is space
for 128 characters. Equivalent to VOLS in the .genisoimagerc
file.</p>

<p>-volset-size # Sets the volume set size to #. The volume
set size is the num- ber of CDs that are in a CD volume set.
A volume set is a col- lection of one or more volumes, on
which a set of files is recorded.</p>

<p>Volume Sets are not intended to be used to create a set
numbered CDs that are part of e.g. a Operation System
installation set of CDs. Volume Sets are rather used to
record a big directory tree that would not fit on a single
volume. Each volume of a Volume Set contains a description
of all the directories and files that are recorded on the
volumes where the sequence numbers are less than, or equal
to, the assigned Volume Set Size of the current volume.</p>

<p>genisoimage currently does not support a -volset-size
that is larger than 1.</p>

<p>The option -volset-size must be specified before
-volset-seqno on each command line.</p>

<p>-volset-seqno # Sets the volume set sequence number to
#. The volume set sequence number is the index number of the
current CD in a CD set. The option -volset-size must be
specified before -volset-seqno on each command line.</p>

<p>-v Verbose execution. If given twice on the command
line, extra debug information will be printed.</p>

<p>-x glob Identical to -m glob.</p>

<p>-z Generate special RRIP records for transparently
compressed files. This is only of use and interest for hosts
that support transparent decompression, such as Linux 2.4.14
or later. You must specify -R or -r to enable Rock Ridge,
and generate com- pressed files using the mkzftree utility
before running genisoimage. Note that transparent
compression is a nonstandard Rock Ridge extension. The
resulting disks are only transpar- ently readable if used on
Linux. On other operating systems you will need to call
mkzftree by hand to decompress the files.</p>

<p>HFS OPTIONS -hfs Create an ISO9660/HFS hybrid CD. This
option should be used in conjunction with the -map, -magic
and/or the various double dash options given below.</p>

<p>-apple Create an ISO9660 CD with Apples extensions.
Similar to -hfs, except that the Apple Extensions to ISO9660
are added instead of creating an HFS hybrid volume. Former
genisoimage versions did include Rock Ridge attributes by
default if -apple was speci- fied. This versions of
genisoimage does not do this anymore. If you like to have
Rock Ridge attributes, you need to specify this
separately.</p>

<p>-map mapping_file Use the mapping_file to set the
CREATOR and TYPE information for a file based on the
filenames extension. A filename is mapped only if it is not
one of the know Apple/Unix file formats. See the HFS
CREATOR/TYPE section below.</p>

<p>-magic magic_file The CREATOR and TYPE information is
set by using a files magic number (usually the first few
bytes of a file). The magic_file is only used if a file is
not one of the known Apple/Unix file formats, or the
filename extension has not been mapped using -map. See the
HFS CREATOR/TYPE section below for more details.</p>

<p>-hfs-creator creator Set the default CREATOR for all
files. Must be exactly 4 charac- ters. See the HFS
CREATOR/TYPE section below for more details.</p>

<p>-hfs-type type Set the default TYPE for all files. Must
be exactly 4 charac- ters. See the HFS CREATOR/TYPE section
below for more details.</p>

<p>-probe Search the contents of files for all the known
Apple/Unix file formats. See the HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below for more about these formats. However, the
only way to check for MacBinary and AppleSingle files is to
open and read them, so this option may increase processing
time. It is better to use one or more double dash options
given below if the Apple/Unix formats in use are known.</p>

<p>-no-desktop Do not create (empty) Desktop files. New HFS
Desktop files will be created when the CD is used on a
Macintosh (and stored in the System Folder). By default,
empty Desktop files are added to the HFS volume.</p>

<p>-mac-name Use the HFS filename as the starting point for
the ISO9660, Joliet and Rock Ridge filenames. See the HFS
MACINTOSH FILENAMES section below for more information.</p>

<p>-boot-hfs-file driver_file Installs the driver_file that
may make the CD bootable on a Mac- intosh. See the HFS BOOT
DRIVER section below. (Alpha).</p>

<p>-part Generate an HFS partition table. By default, no
partition table is generated, but some older Macintosh
CD-ROM drivers need an HFS partition table on the CD-ROM to
be able to recognize a hybrid CD-ROM.</p>

<p>-auto AutoStart_file Make the HFS CD use the QuickTime
2.0 Autostart feature to launch an application or document.
The given filename must be the name of a document or
application located at the top level of the CD. The filename
must be less than 12 characters. (Alpha).</p>

<p>-cluster-size size Set the size in bytes of the cluster
or allocation units of PC Exchange files. Implies
--exchange. See the HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS section
below.</p>

<p>-hide-hfs glob Hide glob, a shell wildcard pattern, from
the HFS volume. The file or directory will still exist in
the ISO9660 and/or Joliet directory. glob may match any part
of the filename. Multiple globs may be excluded.
Example:</p>

<p>genisoimage -o rom -hfs -hide-hfs *.o -hide-hfs
foobar</p>

<p>would exclude all files ending in .o or called foobar
from the HFS volume. Note that if you had a directory called
foobar, it too (and of course all its descendants) would be
excluded. The glob can also be a path name relative to the
source directories given on the command line. Example:</p>

<p>genisoimage -o rom -hfs -hide-hfs src/html src</p>

<p>would exclude just the file or directory called html
from the src directory. Any other file or directory called
html in the tree will not be excluded. Should be used with
-hide and/or -hide-joliet. In order to match a directory
name, make sure the pattern does not include a trailing /
character. See README.hide for more details.</p>

<p>-hide-hfs-list file Specify a file containing a list of
wildcard patterns to be hid- den as in -hide-hfs.</p>

<p>-hfs-volid hfs_volid Volume name for the HFS partition.
This is the name that is assigned to the disc on a Macintosh
and replaces the volid used with -V.</p>

<p>-icon-position Use the icon position information, if it
exists, from the Apple/Unix file. The icons will appear in
the same position as they would on a Macintosh desktop.
Folder location and size on screen, its scroll positions,
folder View (view as Icons, Small Icons, etc.) are also
preserved. (Alpha).</p>

<p>-root-info file Set the location, size on screen, scroll
positions, folder View etc. for the root folder of an HFS
volume. See README.rootinfo for more information.
(Alpha)</p>

<p>-prep-boot file PReP boot image file. Up to 4 are
allowed. See README.prep_boot for more information.
(Alpha)</p>

<p>-chrp-boot Add CHRP boot header.</p>

<p>-input-hfs-charset charset Input charset that defines
the characters used in HFS filenames when used with
-mac-name. The default charset is cp10000 (Mac Roman). See
the CHARACTER SETS and HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES sec- tions
below for more details.</p>

<p>-output-hfs-charset charset Output charset that defines
the characters that will be used in the HFS filenames.
Defaults to the input charset. See the CHAR- ACTER SETS
section below for more details.</p>

<p>-hfs-unlock By default, genisoimage will create an HFS
volume that is locked. This option leaves the volume
unlocked so that other applications (e.g. hfsutils) can
modify the volume. See the HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS section
below for warnings about using this option.</p>

<p>-hfs-bless folder_name &quot;Bless&quot; the given
directory (folder). This is usually the System Folder and is
used in creating HFS bootable CDs. The name of the directory
must be the whole path name as genisoimage sees it. E.g., if
the given pathspec is ./cddata and the required folder is
called System Folder, the whole path name is
&quot;/cddata/System Folder&quot; (remember to use quotes if
the name contains spaces).</p>

<p>-hfs-parms parameters Override certain parameters used
to create the HFS filesystem. Unlikely to be used in normal
circumstances. See the lib- hfs_iso/hybrid.h source file for
details.</p>

<p>--cap Look for AUFS CAP Macintosh files. Search for CAP
Apple/Unix file formats only. Searching for the other
possible Apple/Unix file formats is disabled, unless other
double dash options are given.</p>

<p>--netatalk Look for NETATALK Macintosh files</p>

<p>--double Look for AppleDouble Macintosh files</p>

<p>--ethershare Look for Helios EtherShare Macintosh

<p>CHARACTER SETS genisoimage processes filenames in a
POSIX-compliant way as strings of 8-bit characters. To
represent all codings for all languages, 8-bit characters
are not sufficient. Unicode or ISO-10646 define character
codings that need at least 21 bits to represent all known
languages. They may be represented with UTF-32, UTF-16 or
UTF-8 coding. UTF-32 uses a plain 32-bit coding but seems to
be uncommon. UTF-16 is used by Microsoft with Win32 with the
disadvantage that 16-bit characters are not compliant with
the POSIX filesystem interface.</p>

<p>Modern Unix operating systems may use UTF-8 coding for
filenames. Each 32-bit character is represented by one or
more 8-bit characters. If a character is coded in ISO-8859-1
(used in Central Europe and North America) is maps 1:1 to a
UTF-32 or UTF-16 coded Unicode character. If a character is
coded in 7-Bit ASCII (used in USA and other countries with
limited character set) is maps 1:1 to a UTF-32, UTF-16 or
UTF-8 coded Unicode character. Character codes that cannot
be represented as a single byte in UTF-8 (if the value is
&gt; 0x7F) use escape sequences that map to more than one
8-bit character.</p>

<p>If all operating systems used UTF-8, genisoimage would
not need to recode characters in filenames. Unfortunately,
Apple uses completely nonstandard codings and Microsoft uses
a Unicode coding that is not compatible with the POSIX
filename interface.</p>

<p>For all non-UTF-8-coded operating systems, the actual
character that each byte represents depends on the character
set or codepage (the name used by Microsoft) used by the
local operating system the characters in a character set
will reflect the region or natural language set by the
user.</p>

<p>Usually character codes 0x00-0x1f are control
characters, codes 0x20-0x7f are the 7-bit ASCII characters
and (on PCs and Macs) 0x80-0xff are used for other
characters.</p>

<p>As there are a lot more than 256 characters/symbols in
use, only a small subset are represented in a character set.
Therefore the same character code may represent a different
character in different charac- ter sets. So a filename
generated, say in central Europe, may not dis- play the same
character when viewed on a machine in, say eastern
Europe.</p>

<p>To make matters more complicated, different operating
systems use different character sets for the region or
language. For example, the character code for &eacute;
(small e with acute accent) may be character code 0x82 on a
PC, code 0x8e on a Macintosh, code 0xe9 on a Unix system in
western Europe, and code 0x000e9 in Unicode.</p>

<p>As long as not all operating systems and applications
use the same character set as the basis for filenames, it
may be necessary to spec- ify which character set your
filenames use in and which character set the filenames
should appear on the CD.</p>

<p>There are four options to specify the character sets you
want to use:</p>

<p>-input-charset Defines the local character set you are
using on your host machine. Any character set conversions
that take place will use this character set as the starting
point. The default input character sets are cp437 on
MS-DOS-based systems and iso8859-1 on all other systems. If
-J is given, the Unicode equivalents of the input character
set will be used in the Joliet directory. -jcharset is the
same as -input-charset -J.</p>

<p>-output-charset Defines the character set that will be
used with for the Rock Ridge names on the CD. Defaults to
the input character set.</p>

<p>-input-hfs-charset Defines the HFS character set used
for HFS filenames decoded from any of the various Apple/Unix
file formats. Only useful when used with -mac-name. See the
HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES for more information. Defaults to
cp10000 (Mac Roman).</p>

<p>-output-hfs-charset Defines the HFS character set used
to create HFS filenames from the input character set in use.
In most cases this will be from the character set given with
-input-charset. Defaults to the input HFS character set.</p>

<p>There are a number of character sets built in to
genisoimage. To get a listing, use -input-charset help. This
list doesn t include the charset derived from the current
locale, if genisoimage is built with iconv support.</p>

<p>Additional character sets can be read from file for any
of the charac- ter set options by giving a filename as the
argument to the options. The given file will only be read if
its name does not match one of the built-in character
sets.</p>

<p>The format of the character set files is the same as the
mapping files available from
http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS. This format is:</p>

<p>Column #1 is the input byte code (in hex as 0xXX) Column
#2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX) The rest of the line is
ignored.</p>

<p>Any blank line, line without two (or more) columns in
the above format or comments lines (starting with the #
character) are ignored without any warnings. Any missing
input code is mapped to Unicode character 0x0000.</p>

<p>Note that, while UTF-8 is supported, other Unicode
encodings such as UCS-2/UTF-16 and UCS-4/UTF-32 are not, as
POSIX operating systems can- not handle them natively.</p>

<p>A 1:1 character set mapping can be defined by using the
keyword default as the argument to any of the character set
options. This is the behaviour of old versions of
mkisofs.</p>

<p>The ISO9660 filenames generated from the input filenames
are not con- verted from the input character set. The
ISO9660 character set is a very limited subset of the ASCII
characters, so any conversion would be pointless.</p>

<p>Any character that genisoimage cannot convert will be
replaced with a _ character.</p>

<p>HFS CREATOR/TYPE A Macintosh file has two properties
associated with it which define which application created
the file, the CREATOR and what data the file contains, the
TYPE. Both are (exactly) 4 letter strings. Usually this
allows a Macintosh user to double-click on a file and launch
the cor- rect application etc. The CREATOR and TYPE of a
particular file can be found by using something like ResEdit
(or similar) on a Macintosh.</p>

<p>The CREATOR and TYPE information is stored in all the
various Apple/Unix encoded files. For other files it is
possible to base the CREATOR and TYPE on the filename s
extension using a mapping file (with -map) and/or using the
magic number (usually a signature in the first few bytes) of
a file (with -magic). If both these options are given, their
order on the command line is significant. If -map is given
first, a filename extension match is attempted before a
magic number match. However, if -magic is given first, a
magic number match is attempted before a filename extension
match.</p>

<p>If a mapping or magic file is not used, or no match is
found, the default CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files
can be set by using entries in the .genisoimagerc file or
using -hfs-creator and/or -hfs-type, otherwise the default
CREATOR and TYPE are Unix and TEXT.</p>

<p>The format of the mapping file is the same afpfile
format as used by aufs. This file has five columns for the
extension, file translation, CREATOR, TYPE and Comment.
Lines starting with the # character are comment lines and
are ignored. An example file would be like:</p>

<p># Example filename mapping file # # EXTN XLate CREATOR
TYPE Comment .tif Raw 8BIM TIFF &quot;Photoshop TIFF
image&quot; .hqx Ascii BnHq TEXT &quot;BinHex file&quot;
.doc Raw MSWD WDBN &quot;Word file&quot; .mov Raw TVOD MooV
&quot;QuickTime Movie&quot; * Ascii ttxt TEXT &quot;Text
file&quot;</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>The first column EXTN defines the Unix filename
extension to be mapped. The default mapping for any filename
extension that doesnt match is defined with the *
character.</p>

<p>The Xlate column defines the type of text translation
between the Unix and Macintosh file it is ignored by
genisoimage, but is kept to be compatible with aufs(1).
Although genisoimage does not alter the contents of a file,
if a binary file has its TYPE set as TEXT, it may be read
incorrectly on a Macintosh. There- fore a better choice for
the default TYPE may be ????.</p>

<p>The CREATOR and TYPE keywords must be 4 characters long
and enclosed in single quotes.</p>

<p>The comment field is enclosed in double quotes it is
ignored by genisoimage, but is kept to be compatible with
aufs.</p>

<p>The format of the magic file is almost identical to the
magic(5) file used by the file(1) command.</p>

<p>This file has four tab-separated columns for the byte
offset, type, test and message. Lines starting with the #
character are comment lines and are ignored. An example file
would be like:</p>

<p># Example magic file # # off type test message 0 string
GIF8 8BIM GIFf GIF image 0 beshort 0xffd8 8BIM JPEG image
data 0 string SIT! SIT! SIT! StuffIt Archive 0 string 37235
LZIV ZIVU standard Unix compress 0 string 37213 GNUz ZIVU
gzip compressed data 0 string %! ASPS TEXT Postscript 0
string 04%! ASPS TEXT PC Postscript with a ^D to start 4
string moov txtt MooV QuickTime movie file (moov) 4 string
mdat txtt MooV QuickTime movie file (mdat)</p>

<p>The format of the file is described in magic(5). The
only difference here is that for each entry in the magic
file, the message for the ini- tial offset must be be 4
characters for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters for the
TYPE white space is optional between them. Any other
characters on this line are ignored. Continuation lines
(start- ing with a &gt;) are also ignored, i.e., only the
initial offset lines are used.</p>

<p>Using -magic may significantly increase processing time
as each file has to opened and read to find its magic
number.</p>

<p>In summary, for all files, the default CREATOR is Unix
and the default TYPE is TEXT. These can be changed by using
entries in the .genisoim- agerc file or by using
-hfs-creator and/or -hfs-type.</p>

<p>If the a file is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats
(and the format has been selected), the CREATOR and TYPE are
taken from the values stored in the Apple/Unix file.</p>

<p>Other files can have their CREATOR and TYPE set from
their filename extension (with -map), or their magic number
(with -magic). If the default match is used in the mapping
file, these values override the default CREATOR and
TYPE.</p>

<p>A full CREATOR/TYPE database can be found at
http://www.angelfire.com/il/szekely/.</p>

<p>HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS Macintosh files have two
parts called the Data and Resource fork. Either may be
empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can only cope with files
having one part (or fork). To add to this, Macintosh files
have a num- ber of attributes associated with them probably
the most important are the TYPE and CREATOR. Again, Unix has
no concept of these types of attributes.</p>

<p>E.g., a Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the
image is stored in the Data fork and a desktop thumbnail
stored in the Resource fork. It is usually the information
in the data fork that is useful across plat- forms.</p>

<p>Therefore to store a Macintosh file on a Unix
filesystem, a way has to be found to cope with the two forks
and the extra attributes (which are referred to as the
Finder info). Unfortunately, it seems that every software
package that stores Macintosh files on Unix has chosen a
com- pletely different storage method.</p>

<p>The Apple/Unix formats that genisoimage (partially)
supports are:</p>

<p>CAP AUFS format Data fork stored in a file. Resource
fork in subdirectory .resource with same filename as data
fork. Finder info in subdi- rectory .finderinfo with same
filename.</p>

<p>AppleDouble/Netatalk Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork stored in a file with same name prefixed with
%. Finder info also stored in same % file. Netatalk uses the
same format, but the resource fork/Finder info stored in
subdirectory .AppleDouble with same filename as data
fork.</p>

<p>AppleSingle Data structures similar to above, except
both forks and Finder info are stored in one file.</p>

<p>Helios EtherShare Data fork stored in a file. Resource
fork and Finder info together in subdirectory .rsrc with
same filename as data fork.</p>

<p>IPT UShare Like the EtherShare format, but the Finder
info is stored slightly differently.</p>

<p>MacBinary Both forks and Finder info stored in one
file.</p>

<p>Apple PC Exchange Used by Macintoshes to store Apple
files on DOS (FAT) disks. Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork in subdirectory resource.frk (or
RESOURCE.FRK). Finder info as one record in file finder.dat
(or FINDER.DAT). Separate finder.dat for each data fork
directory.</p>

<p>Note: genisoimage needs to know the native FAT cluster
size of the disk that the PC Exchange files are on (or have
been copied from). This size is given by -cluster-size. The
cluster or allocation size can be found by using the DOS
utility chkdsk.</p>

<p>May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files
(available with MacOS 8.1). DOS media containing PC Exchange
files should be mounted as type msdos (not vfat) when using
Linux.</p>

<p>SGI/XINET Used by SGI machines when they mount HFS
disks. Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in
subdirectory .HSResource with same filename. Finder info as
one record in file .HSancillary. Sep- arate .HSancillary for
each data fork directory.</p>

<p>Thursby Software Systems DAVE Allows Macintoshes to
store Apple files on SMB servers. Data fork stored in a
file. Resource fork in subdirectory resource.frk. Uses the
AppleDouble format to store resource fork.</p>

<p>Services for Macintosh Format of files stored by NT
Servers on NTFS filesystems. Data fork is stored as
filename. Resource fork stored as a NTFS stream called
filename:AFP_Resource. The Finder info is stored as a NTFS
stream called filename:Afp_AfpInfo. NTFS streams are
normally invisible to the user.</p>

<p>Warning: genisoimage only partially supports the SFM
format. If an HFS file or folder stored on the NT server
contains an ille- gal NT character in its name, NT converts
these characters to Private Use Unicode characters. The
characters are: &quot; * / &lt; &gt; ? | and a space or
period if it is the last character of the filename,
character codes 0x01 to 0x1f (control characters) and Apples
apple logo.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these private Unicode characters are not
readable by the genisoimage NT executable. Therefore any
file or direc- tory name containing these characters will be
ignored includ- ing the contents of any such directory.</p>

<p>Mac OS X AppleDouble When HFS/HFS+ files are copied or
saved by Mac OS X on to a non- HFS filesystem (e.g. UFS, NFS
etc.), the files are stored in AppleDouble format. Data fork
stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with same
name prefixed with ._ . Finder info also stored in same ._
file.</p>

<p>Mac OS X HFS (Alpha) Not really an Apple/Unix encoding,
but actual HFS/HFS+ files on a Mac OS X system. Data fork
stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a pseudo file with
the same name with the suffix /rsrc. The Finder info is only
available via a Mac OS X library call.</p>

<p>See also README.macosx.</p>

<p>Only works when used on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>If a file is found with a zero length resource fork and
empty finderinfo, it is assumed not to have any Apple/Unix
encoding therefore a TYPE and CREATOR can be set using other
methods.</p>

<p>genisoimage will attempt to set the CREATOR, TYPE, date
and possibly other flags from the finder info. Additionally,
if it exists, the Mac- intosh filename is set from the
finder info, otherwise the Macintosh name is based on the
Unix filename see the HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES section
below.</p>

<p>When using -apple, the TYPE and CREATOR are stored in
the optional Sys- tem Use or SUSP field in the ISO9660
Directory Record in much the same way as the Rock Ridge
attributes are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple
extensions are added at the beginning of the existing Rock
Ridge attributes (i.e., to get the Apple extensions you get
the Rock Ridge extensions as well).</p>

<p>The Apple extensions require the resource fork to be
stored as an ISO9660 associated file. This is just like any
normal file stored in the ISO9660 filesystem except that the
associated file flag is set in the Directory Record (bit 2).
This file has the same name as the data fork (the file seen
by non-Apple machines). Associated files are nor- mally
ignored by other OSs</p>

<p>When using -hfs, the TYPE and CREATOR plus other finder
info, are stored in a separate HFS directory, not visible on
the ISO9660 volume. The HFS directory references the same
data and resource fork files described above.</p>

<p>In most cases, it is better to use -hfs instead of
-apple, as the lat- ter imposes the limited ISO9660
characters allowed in filenames. How- ever, the Apple
extensions do give the advantage that the files are packed
on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible to fit
more files on a CD.</p>

<p>HFS MACINTOSH FILENAMES Where possible, the HFS filename
that is stored with an Apple/Unix file is used for the HFS
part of the CD. However, not all the Apple/Unix encodings
store the HFS filename with the finderinfo. In these cases,
the Unix filename is used with escaped special characters.
Special characters include / and characters with codes over
127.</p>

<p>AUFS escapes these characters by using : followed by the
character code as two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare
have a similar scheme, but uses % instead of a :.</p>

<p>If genisoimage cannot find an HFS filename, it uses the
Unix name, with any %xx or :xx characters (xx are two hex
digits) converted to a single character code. If xx are not
hex digits ([0-9a-fA-F]), they are left alone although any
remaining : is converted to %, as : is the HFS directory
separator. Care must be taken, as an ordinary Unix file with
%xx or :xx will also be converted. e.g.</p>

<p>This:2fFile converted to This/File</p>

<p>This:File converted to This%File</p>

<p>This:t7File converted to This%t7File</p>

<p>Although HFS filenames appear to support uppercase and
lowercase let- ters, the filesystem is case-insensitive,
i.e., the filenames aBc and AbC are the same. If a file is
found in a directory with the same HFS name, genisoimage
will attempt to make a unique name by adding _ characters to
one of the filenames.</p>

<p>If an HFS filename exists for a file, genisoimage can
use this name as the starting point for the ISO9660, Joliet
and Rock Ridge filenames using -mac-name. Normal Unix files
without an HFS name will still use their Unix name. e.g.</p>

<p>If a MacBinary (or PC Exchange) file is stored as
someimage.gif.bin on the Unix filesystem, but contains a HFS
file called someimage.gif, this is the name that would
appear on the HFS part of the CD. However, as genisoimage
uses the Unix name as the starting point for the other
names, the ISO9660 name generated will probably be
SOMEIMAG.BIN and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
someimage.gif.bin. This option will use the HFS filename as
the starting point and the ISO9660 name will probably be
SOMEIMAG.GIF and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
someimage.gif.</p>

<p>-mac-name will not currently work with -T the Unix name
will be used in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh
name.</p>

<p>The character set used to convert any HFS filename to a
Joliet/Rock Ridge filename defaults to cp10000 (Mac Roman).
The character set used can be specified using
-input-hfs-charset. Other built-in HFS charac- ter sets are:
cp10006 (MacGreek), cp10007 (MacCyrillic), cp10029
(MacLatin2), cp10079 (MacIcelandandic) and cp10081
(MacTurkish).</p>

<p>Note: the character codes used by HFS filenames taken
from the various Apple/Unix formats will not be converted as
they are assumed to be in the correct Apple character set.
Only the Joliet/Rock Ridge names derived from the HFS
filenames will be converted.</p>

<p>The existing genisoimage code will filter out any
illegal characters for the ISO9660 and Joliet filenames, but
as genisoimage expects to be dealing directly with Unix
names, it leaves the Rock Ridge names as is. But as / is a
legal HFS filename character, -mac-name converts / to a _ in
Rock Ridge filenames.</p>

<p>If the Apple extensions are used, only the ISO9660
filenames will appear on the Macintosh. However, as the
Macintosh ISO9660 drivers can use Level 2 filenames, you can
use options like -allow-multidot without problems on a
Macintosh still take care over the names, for example
this.file.name will be converted to THIS.FILE i.e. only have
one ., also filename abcdefgh will be seen as ABCDEFGH but
abcdefghi will be seen as ABCDEFGHI. i.e. with a . at the
end dont know if this is a Macintosh problem or a
genisoimage/mkhybrid problem. All filenames will be in
uppercase when viewed on a Macintosh. Of course, DOS/Win3.X
machines will not be able to see Level 2 filenames...</p>

<p>HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS To give a HFS CD a custom
icon, make sure the root (top level) folder includes a
standard Macintosh volume icon file. To give a volume a cus-
tom icon on a Macintosh, an icon has to be pasted over the
volumes icon in the &quot;Get Info&quot; box of the volume.
This creates an invisible is the carriage return character)
in file called Iconr ( the root folder.</p>

<p>A custom folder icon is very similar an invisible file
called Iconr exists in the folder itself.</p>

<p>Probably the easiest way to create a custom icon that
genisoimage can use is to format a blank HFS floppy disk on
a Mac and paste an icon to its &quot;Get Info&quot; box. If
using Linux with the HFS module installed, mount the
floppy:</p>

<p>mount -t hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy</p>

<p>The floppy will be mounted as a CAP filesystem by
default. Then run genisoimage using something like:</p>

<p>genisoimage --cap -o output source_dir /mnt/floppy</p>

<p>If you are not using Linux, you can use hfsutils to copy
the icon file from the floppy. However, care has to be
taken, as the icon file con- tains a control character. For
example:</p>

<p>hmount /dev/fd0 hdir -a hcopy -m Icon^V^M
icon_dir/icon</p>

<p>Where ^V^M is control-V followed by control-M. Then run
genisoimage by using something like:</p>

<p>genisoimage --macbin -o output source_dir icon_dir</p>

<p>The procedure for creating/using custom folder icons is
very similar paste an icon to folders &quot;Get Info&quot;
box and transfer the resulting Iconr file to the relevant
directory in the genisoimage source tree.</p>

<p>You may want to hide the icon files from the ISO9660 and
Joliet trees.</p>

<p>To give a custom icon to a Joliet CD, follow the
instructions found at
http://www.cdrfaq.org/faq03.html#S3-21-1.</p>

<p>HFS BOOT DRIVER It may be possible to make the hybrid CD
bootable on a Macintosh.</p>

<p>A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or
compatible) driver, a bootable HFS partition and the
necessary System, Finder, etc. files.</p>

<p>A driver can be obtained from any other Macintosh
bootable CD-ROM using the apple_driver utility. This file
can then be used with -boot-hfs-file.</p>

<p>The HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case)
must contain a suitable System Folder, again from another
CD-ROM or disk.</p>

<p>For a partition to be bootable, it must have its boot
block set. The boot block is in the first two blocks of a
partition. For a non- bootable partition the boot block is
full of zeros. Normally, when a System file is copied to
partition on a Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with
a number of required settings unfortunately I dont know the
full spec for the boot block, so Im guessing that the
follow- ing will work.</p>

<p>Therefore, the utility apple_driver also extracts the
boot block from the first HFS partition it finds on the
given CD-ROM and this is used for the HFS partition created
by genisoimage.</p>

<p>Please note: By using a driver from an Apple CD and
copying Apple soft- ware to your CD, you become liable to
obey Apple Computer, Inc. Soft- ware License Agreements.</p>

<p>EL TORITO BOOT INFORMATION TABLE When -boot-info-table
is given, genisoimage will modify the boot file specified by
-b by inserting a 56-byte boot information table at offset 8
in the file. This modification is done in the source
filesystem, so make sure you use a copy if this file is not
easily recreated! This file contains pointers which may not
be easily or reliably obtained at boot time.</p>

<p>The format of this table is as follows; all integers are
in section 7.3.1 (&quot;little endian&quot;) format.</p>

<p>Offset Name Size Meaning 8 bi_pvd 4 bytes LBA of primary
volume descriptor 12 bi_file 4 bytes LBA of boot file 16
bi_length 4 bytes Boot file length in bytes 20 bi_csum 4
bytes 32-bit checksum 24 bi_reserved 40 bytes Reserved</p>

<p>The 32-bit checksum is the sum of all the 32-bit words
in the boot file starting at byte offset 64. All linear
block addresses (LBAs) are given in CD sectors (normally
2048 bytes).</p>

<p>HPPA NOTES To make a bootable CD for HPPA, at the very
least a boot loader file (-hppa-bootloader), a kernel image
file (32-bit, 64-bit, or both, depending on hardware) and a
boot command line (-hppa-cmdline) must be specified. Some
systems can boot either a 32- or a 64-bit kernel, and the
firmware will choose one if both are present. Optionally, a
ramdisk can be used for the root filesystem using
-hppa-cmdline.</p>

<p>JIGDO NOTES Jigdo is a tool to help in the distribution
of large files like CD and DVD images; see
http://atterer.net/jigdo/ for more details. Debian CDs and
DVD ISO images are published on the web in jigdo format to
allow end users to download them more efficiently.</p>

<p>To create jigdo and template files alongside the ISO
image from genisoimage, you must first generate a list of
the files that will be used, in the following format:</p>

<p>MD5sum File size Path 32 chars 12 chars to end of
line</p>

<p>The MD5sum should be written in jigdo s pseudo-base64
format. The file size should be in decimal, and the path to
the file must be absolute.</p>

<p>Once you have this file, call genisoimage with all of
your normal com- mand-line parameters. Specify the output
filenames for the jigdo and template files using
-jigdo-jigdo and -jigdo-template, and pass in the location
of your MD5 list with -md5-list.</p>

<p>If there are files that you do NOT want to be added into
the jigdo file (e.g. if they are likely to change often),
specify them using -jigdo-ignore. If you want to verify some
of the files as they are written into the image, specify
them using -jigdo-force-md5. If any files don t match,
genisoimage will then abort. Both of these options take
regular expressions as input. It is possible to restrict the
set of files that will be used further based on size use the
-jigdo-min-file-size option.</p>

<p>Finally, the jigdo code needs to know how to map the
files it is given onto a mirror-style configuration. Specify
how to map paths using -jigdo-map. Using
Debian=/mirror/debian will cause all paths starting with
/mirror/debian to be mapped to Debian:&lt;file&gt; in the
output jigdo file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To create a vanilla ISO9660 filesystem image in
the file cd.iso, where the directory cd_dir will become the
root directory if the CD, call:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso cd_dir</p>

<p>To create a CD with Rock Ridge extensions of the source
directory cd_dir:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso -R cd_dir</p>

<p>To create a CD with Rock Ridge extensions of the source
directory cd_dir where all files have at least read
permission and all files are owned by root, call:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso -r cd_dir</p>

<p>To write a tar archive directly to a CD that will later
contain a sim- ple ISO9660 filesystem with the tar archive
call:</p>

<p>% tar cf - . | genisoimage -stream-media-size 333000 |
wodim dev=b,t,l -dao tsize=333000s -</p>

<p>To create a HFS hybrid CD with the Joliet and Rock Ridge
extensions of the source directory cd_dir:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso -R -J -hfs cd_dir</p>

<p>To create a HFS hybrid CD from the source directory
cd_dir that con- tains Netatalk Apple/Unix files:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso --netatalk cd_dir</p>

<p>To create a HFS hybrid CD from the source directory
cd_dir, giving all files CREATOR and TYPES based on just
their filename extensions listed in the file
&quot;mapping&quot;.:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso -map mapping cd_dir</p>

<p>To create a CD with the Apple Extensions to ISO9660,
from the source directories cd_dir and another_dir. Files in
all the known Apple/Unix format are decoded and any other
files are given CREATOR and TYPE based on their magic number
given in the file magic:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso -apple -magic magic -probe
cd_dir another_dir</p>

<p>The following example puts different files on the CD
that all have the name README, but have different contents
when seen as a ISO9660/Rock Ridge, Joliet or HFS CD.</p>

<p>Current directory contains:</p>

<p>% ls -F README.hfs README.joliet README.Unix cd_dir/</p>

<p>The following command puts the contents of the directory
cd_dir on the CD along with the three README files but only
one will be seen from each of the three filesystems:</p>

<p>% genisoimage -o cd.iso -hfs -J -r -graft-points -hide
README.hfs -hide README.joliet -hide-joliet README.hfs
-hide-joliet README.Unix -hide-hfs README.joliet -hide-hfs
README.Unix README=README.hfs README=README.joliet
README=README.Unix cd_dir</p>

<p>i.e. the file README.hfs will be seen as README on the
HFS CD and the other two README files will be hidden.
Similarly for the Joliet and ISO9660/Rock Ridge CD.</p>

<p>There are probably all sorts of strange results possible
with combina- tions of the hide options ...</p>

<p>NOTES genisoimage may safely be installed suid root.
This may be needed to allow genisoimage to read the previous
session when creating a multi- session image.</p>

<p>If genisoimage is creating a filesystem image with Rock
Ridge attributes and the directory nesting level of the
source directory tree is too much for ISO9660, genisoimage
will do deep directory relocation. This results in a
directory called RR_MOVED in the root directory of the CD.
You cannot avoid this directory.</p>

<p>Many boot code options for different platforms are
mutualy exclusive because the boot blocks cannot coexist,
ie. different platforms share the same data locations in the
image. See
http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2006/12/msg00109.html for
details.</p>

<p>BUGS Any files that have hard links to files not in the
tree being copied to the ISO9660 filesystem will have an
incorrect file reference count.</p>

<p>Does not check for SUSP record(s) in . entry of the root
directory to verify the existence of Rock Ridge
enhancements. This problem is present when reading old
sessions while adding data in multisession mode.</p>

<p>Does not properly read relocated directories in
multisession mode when adding data. Any relocated deep
directory is lost if the new session does not include the
deep directory.</p>

<p>Does not re-use RR_MOVED when doing multisession from
TRANS.TBL.</p>

<p>Does not create whole_name entry for RR_MOVED in
multisession mode.</p>

<p>There may be other bugs. Please, report them to the
maintainers.</p>

<p>HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS I have had to make several
assumptions on how I expect the modified libhfs routines to
work, however there may be situations that either I havent
thought of, or come across when these assumptions fail.
There- fore I can t guarantee that genisoimage will work as
expected (although I havent had a major problem yet). Most
of the HFS features work fine, but some are not fully
tested. These are marked as Alpha above.</p>

<p>Although HFS filenames appear to support uppercase and
lowercase let- ters, the filesystem is case-insensitive,
i.e., the filenames aBc and AbC are the same. If a file is
found in a directory with the same HFS name, genisoimage
will attempt to make a unique name by adding _ characters to
one of the filenames.</p>

<p>HFS file/directory names that share the first 31
characters have _N (a decimal number) substituted for the
last few characters to generate unique names.</p>

<p>Care must be taken when &quot;grafting&quot; Apple/Unix
files or directories (see above for the method and syntax
involved). It is not possible to use a new name for an
Apple/Unix encoded file/directory. e.g. If a Apple/Unix
encoded file called oldname is to added to the CD, you
cannot use the command line:</p>

<p>genisoimage -o output.raw -hfs -graft-points
newname=oldname cd_dir</p>

<p>genisoimage will be unable to decode oldname. However,
you can graft Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as
long as you do not attempt to give them new names as
above.</p>

<p>When creating an HFS volume with the multisession
options, -M and -C, only files in the last session will be
in the HFS volume. i.e. genisoimage cannot add existing
files from previous sessions to the HFS volume.</p>

<p>However, if each session is created with -part, each
session will appear as separate volumes when mounted on a
Mac. In this case, it is worth using -V or -hfs-volid to
give each session a unique volume name, otherwise each
&quot;volume&quot; will appear on the Desktop with the same
name.</p>

<p>Symbolic links (as with all other non-regular files) are
not added to the HFS directory.</p>

<p>Hybrid volumes may be larger than pure ISO9660 volumes
containing the same data. In some cases (e.g. DVD sized
volumes) the difference can be significant. As an HFS volume
gets bigger, so does the allocation block size (the smallest
amount of space a file can occupy). For a 650MB CD, the
allocation block is 10kB, for a 4.7GB DVD it will be about
70kB.</p>

<p>The maximum number of files in an HFS volume is about
65500 although the real limit will be somewhat less than
this.</p>

<p>The resulting hybrid volume can be accessed on a Unix
machine by using the hfsutils routines. However, no changes
can be made to the volume as it is set as locked. The option
-hfs-unlock will create an output image that is unlocked
however no changes should be made to the con- tents of the
volume (unless you really know what you are doing) as its
not a &quot;real&quot; HFS volume.</p>

<p>-mac-name will not currently work with -T the Unix name
will be used in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh
name.</p>

<p>Although genisoimage does not alter the contents of a
file, if a binary file has its TYPE set as TEXT, it may be
read incorrectly on a Macin- tosh. Therefore a better choice
for the default TYPE may be ????.</p>

<p>-mac-boot-file may not work at all...</p>

<p>May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files
(available with MacOS 8.1). DOS media containing PC Exchange
files should be mounted as type msdos (not vfat) when using
Linux.</p>

<p>The SFM format is only partially supported see HFS
MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS section above.</p>

<p>It is not possible to use -sparc-boot or -generic-boot
with -boot-hfs-file or -prep-boot.</p>

<p>genisoimage should be able to create HFS hybrid images
over 4Gb, although this has not been fully tested.</p>

<p>AUTHORS genisoimage is derived from mkisofs from the
cdrtools 2.01.01a08 pack- age from May 2006 (with few
updates extracted from cdrtools 2.01.01a24 from March 2007)
from .IR http://cdrecord.berlios.de/ , but is now part of
the cdrkit suite, maintained by Joerg Jaspert, Eduard Bloch,
Steve McIntyre, Peter Samuelson, Christian Fromme, Ben
Hutchings, and other contributors. The maintainers can be
contacted at debburn- devel@lists.alioth.debian.org, or see
the cdrkit project web site at http://www.cdrkit.org/.</p>

<p>Eric Youngdale wrote the first versions (1993 1998) of
mkisofs. J&ouml;rg Schilling wrote the SCSI transport
library and its interface, and has maintained mkisofs since
1999. James Pearson wrote the HFS hybrid code, using libhfs
by Robert Leslie. Pearson, Schilling, Jungshik Shin and
Jaakko Heinonen contributed to the character set conversion
code. The cdrkit maintainers have maintained genisoimage
since 2006.</p>
