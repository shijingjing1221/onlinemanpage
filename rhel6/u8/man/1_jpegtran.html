<p>NAME jpegtran - lossless transformation of JPEG
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jpegtran [ options ] [ filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION jpegtran performs various useful
transformations of JPEG files. It can translate the coded
representation from one variant of JPEG to another, for
example from baseline JPEG to progressive JPEG or vice
versa. It can also perform some rearrangements of the image
data, for example turning an image from landscape to
portrait format by rotation.</p>

<p>jpegtran works by rearranging the compressed data (DCT
coefficients), without ever fully decoding the image.
Therefore, its transformations are lossless: there is no
image degradation at all, which would not be true if you
used djpeg followed by cjpeg to accomplish the same conver-
sion. But by the same token, jpegtran cannot perform lossy
operations such as changing the image quality.</p>

<p>jpegtran reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard
input if no file is named, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on
the standard output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All switch names may be abbreviated; for
example, -optimize may be written -opt or -o. Upper and
lower case are equivalent. British spellings are also
accepted (e.g., -optimise), though for brevity these are not
mentioned below.</p>

<p>To specify the coded JPEG representation used in the
output file, jpeg- tran accepts a subset of the switches
recognized by cjpeg:</p>

<p>-optimize Perform optimization of entropy encoding
parameters.</p>

<p>-progressive Create progressive JPEG file.</p>

<p>-restart N Emit a JPEG restart marker every N MCU rows,
or every N MCU blocks if &quot;B&quot; is attached to the
number.</p>

<p>-arithmetic Use arithmetic coding.</p>

<p>-scans file Use the scan script given in the specified
text file.</p>

<p>See cjpeg(1) for more details about these switches. If
you specify none of these switches, you get a plain
baseline-JPEG output file. The quality setting and so forth
are determined by the input file.</p>

<p>The image can be losslessly transformed by giving one of
these switches:</p>

<p>-flip horizontal Mirror image horizontally
(left-right).</p>

<p>-flip vertical Mirror image vertically (top-bottom).</p>

<p>-rotate 90 Rotate image 90 degrees clockwise.</p>

<p>-rotate 180 Rotate image 180 degrees.</p>

<p>-rotate 270 Rotate image 270 degrees clockwise (or 90
ccw).</p>

<p>-transpose Transpose image (across UL-to-LR axis).</p>

<p>-transverse Transverse transpose (across UR-to-LL
axis).</p>

<p>The transpose transformation has no restrictions
regarding image dimen- sions. The other transformations
operate rather oddly if the image dimensions are not a
multiple of the iMCU size (usually 8 or 16 pix- els),
because they can only transform complete blocks of DCT
coeffi- cient data in the desired way.</p>

<p>jpegtran s default behavior when transforming an
odd-size image is designed to preserve exact reversibility
and mathematical consistency of the transformation set. As
stated, transpose is able to flip the entire image area.
Horizontal mirroring leaves any partial iMCU column at the
right edge untouched, but is able to flip all rows of the
image. Similarly, vertical mirroring leaves any partial iMCU
row at the bottom edge untouched, but is able to flip all
columns. The other transforms can be built up as sequences
of transpose and flip operations; for con- sistency, their
actions on edge pixels are defined to be the same as the end
result of the corresponding transpose-and-flip sequence.</p>

<p>For practical use, you may prefer to discard any
untransformable edge pixels rather than having a
strange-looking strip along the right and/or bottom edges of
a transformed image. To do this, add the -trim switch:</p>

<p>-trim Drop non-transformable edge blocks.</p>

<p>Obviously, a transformation with -trim is not
reversible, so strictly speaking jpegtran with this switch
is not lossless. Also, the expected mathematical
equivalences between the trans- formations no longer hold.
For example, -rot 270 -trim trims only the bottom edge, but
-rot 90 -trim followed by -rot 180 -trim trims both
edges.</p>

<p>-perfect If you are only interested in perfect
transformations, add the -perfect switch. This causes
jpegtran to fail with an error if the transformation is not
perfect.</p>

<p>For example, you may want to do</p>

<p>(jpegtran -rot 90 -perfect foo.jpg || djpeg foo.jpg |
pnmflip -r90 | cjpeg)</p>

<p>to do a perfect rotation, if available, or an
approximated one if not.</p>

<p>-crop WxH+X+Y Crop the image to a rectangular region of
width W and height H, starting at point X,Y. The lossless
crop feature discards data outside of a given image region
but losslessly preserves what is inside. Like the rotate and
flip transforms, lossless crop is restricted by the current
JPEG format; the upper left corner of the selected region
must fall on an iMCU boundary. If it doesnt, then it is
silently moved up and/or left to the nearest iMCU boundary
(the lower right corner is unchanged.)</p>

<p>Other not-strictly-lossless transformation switches
are:</p>

<p>-grayscale Force grayscale output.</p>

<p>This option discards the chrominance channels if the
input image is YCbCr (ie, a standard color JPEG), resulting
in a grayscale JPEG file. The luminance channel is preserved
exactly, so this is a better method of reducing to grayscale
than decompression, conversion, and recompression. This
switch is particularly handy for fixing a monochrome picture
that was mistakenly encoded as a color JPEG. (In such a
case, the space savings from getting rid of the near-empty
chroma channels wont be large; but the decoding time for a
grayscale JPEG is substan- tially less than that for a color
JPEG.)</p>

<p>jpegtran also recognizes these switches that control
what to do with &quot;extra&quot; markers, such as comment
blocks:</p>

<p>-copy none Copy no extra markers from source file. This
setting suppresses all comments and other excess baggage
present in the source file.</p>

<p>-copy comments Copy only comment markers. This setting
copies comments from the source file but discards any other
data that is inessential for image display.</p>

<p>-copy all Copy all extra markers. This setting preserves
miscellaneous markers found in the source file, such as JFIF
thumbnails, Exif data, and Photoshop settings. In some
files, these extra mark- ers can be sizable.</p>

<p>The default behavior is -copy comments. (Note: in IJG
releases v6 and v6a, jpegtran always did the equivalent of
-copy none.)</p>

<p>Additional switches recognized by jpegtran are:</p>

<p>-maxmemory N Set limit for amount of memory to use in
processing large images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or
millions of bytes if &quot;M&quot; is attached to the
number. For example, -max 4m selects 4000000 bytes. If more
space is needed, temporary files will be used.</p>

<p>-outfile name Send output image to the named file, not
to standard output.</p>

<p>-verbose Enable debug printout. More -vs give more
output. Also, ver- sion information is printed at
startup.</p>

<p>-debug Same as -verbose.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example converts a baseline JPEG file to
progressive form:</p>

<p>jpegtran -progressive foo.jpg &gt; fooprog.jpg</p>

<p>This example rotates an image 90 degrees clockwise,
discarding any unrotatable edge pixels:</p>

<p>jpegtran -rot 90 -trim foo.jpg &gt; foo90.jpg</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT JPEGMEM If this environment variable is set,
its value is the default memory limit. The value is
specified as described for the -maxmemory switch. JPEGMEM
overrides the default value speci- fied when the program was
compiled, and itself is overridden by an explicit
-maxmemory.</p>

<p>BUGS The transform options can t transform odd-size
images perfectly. Use -trim or -perfect if you dont like the
results.</p>

<p>The entire image is read into memory and then written
out again, even in cases where this isn t really necessary.
Expect swapping on large images, especially when using the
more complex transform options.</p>
