<p>xcb_grab_keyboard(3) XCB Requests
xcb_grab_keyboard(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_grab_keyboard - Grab the keyboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_grab_keyboard_cookie_t
xcb_grab_keyboard(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t
owner_events, xcb_window_t grab_window, xcb_timestamp_t
time, uint8_t pointer_mode, uint8_t keyboard_mode);</p>

<p>Reply datastructure typedef struct
xcb_grab_keyboard_reply_t { uint8_t response_type; uint8_t
status; uint16_t sequence; uint32_t length; }
xcb_grab_keyboard_reply_t;</p>

<p>Reply function xcb_grab_keyboard_reply_t
*xcb_grab_keyboard_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn,
xcb_grab_keyboard_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t
**e);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>owner_events If 1, the grab_window will still get the
pointer events. If 0, events are not reported to the
grab_window.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the window on which the pointer
should be grabbed.</p>

<p>time Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X
over the network.</p>

<p>The special value XCB_CURRENT_TIME will be replaced with
the current server time.</p>

<p>pointer_mode One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC The state of the keyboard appears to
freeze: No further keyboard events are generated by the
server until the grabbing client issues a releasing Allow-
Events request or until the keyboard grab is re- leased.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC Keyboard event processing continues
normally.</p>

<p>keyboard_mode One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC The state of the keyboard appears to
freeze: No further keyboard events are generated by the
server until the grabbing client issues a releasing Allow-
Events request or until the keyboard grab is re- leased.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC Keyboard event processing continues
normally.</p>

<p>REPLY FIELDS response_type The type of this reply, in
this case XCB_GRAB_KEYBOARD. This field is also present in
the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies
apart from each other.</p>

<p>sequence The sequence number of the last request
processed by the X11 server.</p>

<p>length The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4
bytes).</p>

<p>status One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_SUCCESS TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_ALREADY_GRABBED TODO: NOT YET
DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_INVALID_TIME TODO: NOT YET
DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_NOT_VIEWABLE TODO: NOT YET
DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_FROZEN TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED. TODO:
NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Actively grabs control of the keyboard and
generates FocusIn and Focu- sOut events. Further key events
are reported only to the grabbing client.</p>

<p>Any active keyboard grab by this client is overridden.
If the keyboard is actively grabbed by some other client,
AlreadyGrabbed is returned. If grab_window is not viewable,
GrabNotViewable is returned. If the keyboard is frozen by an
active grab of another client, GrabFrozen is returned. If
the specified time is earlier than the last-keyboard-grab
time or later than the current X server time,
GrabInvalidTime is re- turned. Otherwise, the
last-keyboard-grab time is set to the specified time.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_grab_keyboard_cookie_t.
Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function
xcb_grab_keyboard_reply.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead,
use xcb_grab_keyboard_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for
details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_value_error_t TODO: reasons?</p>

<p>xcb_window_error_t The specified window does not
exist.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE /* * Grabs the keyboard actively * */ void
my_example(xcb_connection *conn, xcb_screen_t *screen) {
xcb_grab_keyboard_cookie_t cookie; xcb_grab_keyboard_reply_t
*reply;</p>

<p>cookie = xcb_grab_keyboard( conn, true, /* report events
*/ screen-&gt;root, /* grab the root window */
XCB_CURRENT_TIME, XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC, /* process events as
normal, do not require sync */ XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC );</p>

<p>if ((reply = xcb_grab_keyboard_reply(conn, cookie,
NULL))) { if (reply-&gt;status == XCB_GRAB_STATUS_SUCCESS)
printf(&quot;successfully grabbed the keyboard0);</p>

<p>free(reply); } }</p>
