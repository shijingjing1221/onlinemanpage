<p>xcb_grab_pointer(3) XCB Requests xcb_grab_pointer(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_grab_pointer - Grab the pointer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_grab_pointer_cookie_t
xcb_grab_pointer(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t
owner_events, xcb_window_t grab_window, uint16_t event_mask,
uint8_t pointer_mode, uint8_t keyboard_mode, xcb_window_t
confine_to, xcb_cursor_t cursor, xcb_timestamp_t time);</p>

<p>Reply datastructure typedef struct
xcb_grab_pointer_reply_t { uint8_t response_type; uint8_t
status; uint16_t sequence; uint32_t length; }
xcb_grab_pointer_reply_t;</p>

<p>Reply function xcb_grab_pointer_reply_t
*xcb_grab_pointer_reply(xcb_connection_t *conn,
xcb_grab_pointer_cookie_t cookie, xcb_generic_error_t
**e);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>owner_events If 1, the grab_window will still get the
pointer events. If 0, events are not reported to the
grab_window.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the window on which the pointer
should be grabbed.</p>

<p>event_mask Specifies which pointer events are reported
to the client.</p>

<p>TODO: which values?</p>

<p>pointer_mode One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC The state of the keyboard appears to
freeze: No further keyboard events are generated by the
server until the grabbing client issues a releasing Allow-
Events request or until the keyboard grab is re- leased.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC Keyboard event processing continues
normally.</p>

<p>keyboard_mode One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC The state of the keyboard appears to
freeze: No further keyboard events are generated by the
server until the grabbing client issues a releasing Allow-
Events request or until the keyboard grab is re- leased.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC Keyboard event processing continues
normally.</p>

<p>confine_to Specifies the window to confine the pointer
in (the user will not be able to move the pointer out of
that window).</p>

<p>The special value XCB_NONE means dont confine the
pointer.</p>

<p>cursor Specifies the cursor that should be displayed or
XCB_NONE to not change the cursor.</p>

<p>time The time argument allows you to avoid certain
circumstances that come up if applications take a long time
to respond or if there are long network delays. Consider a
situation where you have two applications, both of which
normally grab the pointer when clicked on. If both
applications specify the timestamp from the event, the
second application may wake up faster and successfully grab
the pointer before the first ap- plication. The first
application then will get an indication that the other
application grabbed the pointer before its re- quest was
processed.</p>

<p>The special value XCB_CURRENT_TIME will be replaced with
the current server time.</p>

<p>REPLY FIELDS response_type The type of this reply, in
this case XCB_GRAB_POINTER. This field is also present in
the xcb_generic_reply_t and can be used to tell replies
apart from each other.</p>

<p>sequence The sequence number of the last request
processed by the X11 server.</p>

<p>length The length of the reply, in words (a word is 4
bytes).</p>

<p>status One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_SUCCESS TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_ALREADY_GRABBED TODO: NOT YET
DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_INVALID_TIME TODO: NOT YET
DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_NOT_VIEWABLE TODO: NOT YET
DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>XCB_GRAB_STATUS_FROZEN TODO: NOT YET DOCUMENTED. TODO:
NOT YET DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Actively grabs control of the pointer.
Further pointer events are re- ported only to the grabbing
client. Overrides any active pointer grab by this
client.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_grab_pointer_cookie_t.
Errors have to be handled when calling the reply function
xcb_grab_pointer_reply.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors in the event loop instead,
use xcb_grab_pointer_unchecked. See xcb-requests(3) for
details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_value_error_t TODO: reasons?</p>

<p>xcb_window_error_t The specified window does not
exist.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE /* * Grabs the pointer actively * */ void
my_example(xcb_connection *conn, xcb_screen_t *screen,
xcb_cursor_t cursor) { xcb_grab_pointer_cookie_t cookie;
xcb_grab_pointer_reply_t *reply;</p>

<p>cookie = xcb_grab_pointer( conn, false, /* get all
pointer events specified by the following mask */
screen-&gt;root, /* grab the root window */ XCB_NONE, /*
which events to let through */ XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC, /*
pointer events should continue as normal */
XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC, /* keyboard mode */ XCB_NONE, /*
confine_to = in which window should the cursor stay */
cursor, /* we change the cursor to whatever the user wanted
*/ XCB_CURRENT_TIME );</p>

<p>if ((reply = xcb_grab_pointer_reply(conn, cookie,
NULL))) { if (reply-&gt;status == XCB_GRAB_STATUS_SUCCESS)
printf(&quot;successfully grabbed the pointer0);
free(preply); } }</p>
