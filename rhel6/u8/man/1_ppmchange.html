<p>NAME ppmchange - change all pixels of one color to
another in a PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmchange</p>

<p>[-closeness=closeness_percent]
[-remainder=remainder_color] [-closeok] [oldcolor newcolor]
... [ppmfile]</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ppmchange red blue redimage.ppm
&gt;blueimage.ppm</p>

<p>ppmchange red red -remainder=black myimage.ppm
&gt;redblack.ppm</p>

<p>ppmchange -closeness=90 white white black black</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmchange reads a PPM image as input and changes all
pixels of colr oldcolor to color newcolor.</p>

<p>You may specify up to 256 oldcolor/newcolor pairs on the
command line. ppmchange leaves all colors not mentioned
unchanged, unless you specify the -remainder option, in
which case they are all changed to the single specified
color.</p>

<p>You can specify that colors similar, but not identical,
to the ones you specify get replaced by specifying a
closeness factor.</p>

<p>Specify the colors as described for the argument of the
ppm_parsec- olor() library routine .</p>

<p>If a pixel matches two different oldcolors, ppmchange
replaces it with the newcolor of the leftmost specified
one.</p>

<p>The maxval of the output image is the same as that of
the input image. If a newcolor you specify cannot be exactly
represented in that maxval, ppmchange assumes a color that
is as close as possible to what you specified but can be
represented with your maxval. Unless you specify the
-closeok option, ppmchange issues a warning that it is using
an approximation.</p>

<p>A common way that you can have this maxval problem,
where the color you specify cannot be represented with your
maxval, is that your input is a PBM (black and white) image
that you are colorizing. The maxval in this case is 1, which
severely limits the colors to which you can change. To avoid
this problem, use pamdepth to make the maxval of your input
something consistent with your colors. 255 is usually a good
choice.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004), ppmchange always
behaved as if the user specified -closeok and there was no
-closeok option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -closeness closeness_percent closeness is an
integer per centage indicating how close to the color you
specified a pixel must be to get replaced. By default, it is
0, which means the pixel must be the exact color you
specified.</p>

<p>A pixel gets replaced if the distance in color between
it and the color you specified is less than or equal to
closeness per cent of the maxval.</p>

<p>The distance in color is defined as the cartesian sum of
the individual differences in red, green, and blue
intensities between the two pixels, normalized so that the
difference between black and white is 100%.</p>

<p>This is probably simpler than what you want most the
time. You probably would like to change colors that have
similar chromi- nance, regardless of their intensity. So if
there s a red barn that is variously shadowed, you want the
entire barn changed. But because the shadowing significantly
changes the color according to ppmchanges distance formula,
parts of the barn are probably about as distant in color
from other parts of the barn as they are from green grass
next to the barn.</p>

<p>Maybe ppmchange will be enhanced some day to do
chrominance analysis.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 9.8 (September 2000).</p>

<p>-closeok This option affects how ppmchange interprets a
color you specify in the arguments. When you specify this
option, ppmchange may use a color close to, but not the same
as what you specify. See the description section for
details.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004). Before
that, ppmchange always behaved as if you specified this
option.</p>

<p>-remainder color ppmchange changes all pixels which are
not of a color for which you specify an explicit replacement
color on the command line to color color.</p>

<p>An example application of this is</p>

<p>ppmchange -remainder=black red red</p>

<p>to lift only the red portions from an image, or
ppmchange -remainder=black red white | ppmtopgm</p>

<p>to create a mask file for the red portions of the
image.</p>
