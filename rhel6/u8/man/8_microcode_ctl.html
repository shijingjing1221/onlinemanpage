<p>NAME microcode_ctl - microcode utility for Intel IA32
processors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS microcode_ctl [-h] [-u [-q]] [-Q] [-f
microcode]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to
the IA32 microcode driver written by Tigran Aivazian
&lt;tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk&gt;. The utility has two
uses:</p>

<p>a) it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel
driver to be uploaded to Intel IA32 processors. (Pentium
Pro, PII, Celeron, PIII, Xeon, Pentium 4 etc)</p>

<p>b) it signals the kernel driver to release the buffers
containing the copy of microcode data actually applied to
given CPU, linear array of 2048 bytes per CPU, see struct
microcode in include/asm/processor.h for information on the
layout of chunks buffers may hold</p>

<p>The microcode update is volatile and needs to be
uploaded on each sys- tem boot i.e. it doesnt reflash your
cpu permanently, reboot and it reverts back to the old
microcode.</p>

<p>-h display usage and exit</p>

<p>-u upload microcode (from default filename)</p>

<p>-f upload microcode from named Intel formatted file</p>

<p>-q run silently when successful</p>

<p>-Q run silently even on failure</p>

<p>EXAMPLE microcode_ctl -u Upload microcode using
defaults</p>

<p>FILES /etc/microcode.dat The default microcode
location</p>
