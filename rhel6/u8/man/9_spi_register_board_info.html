<p>SPI_REGISTER_BOARD_I(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
SPI_REGISTER_BOARD_I(9)</p>

<p>NAME spi_register_board_info - register SPI devices for
a given board</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int spi_register_board_info(struct
spi_board_info const * info, unsigned n);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS info array of chip descriptors</p>

<p>n how many descriptors are provided</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Board-specific early init code calls this
(probably during arch_initcall) with segments of the SPI
device table. Any device nodes are created later, after the
relevant parent SPI controller (bus_num) is defined. We keep
this table of devices forever, so that reloading a
controller driver will not make Linux forget about these
hard-wired devices.</p>

<p>Other code can also call this, e.g. a particular add-on
board might provide SPI devices through its expansion
connector, so code initializing that board would naturally
declare its SPI devices.</p>

<p>The board info passed can safely be __initdata ... but
be careful of any embedded pointers (platform_data, etc),
they&acute;re copied as-is.</p>
