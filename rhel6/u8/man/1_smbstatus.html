<p>NAME smbstatus - report on current Samba connections</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smbstatus [-P] [-b] [-d &lt;debug level&gt;]
[-v] [-L] [-B] [-p] [-S] [-s &lt;configuration file&gt;] [-u
&lt;username&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>smbstatus is a very simple program to list the current
Samba connections.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -P|--profile If samba has been compiled with the
profiling option, print only the contents of the profiling
shared memory area.</p>

<p>-b|--brief gives brief output.</p>

<p>-d|--debuglevel=level level is an integer from 0 to 10.
The default value if this parameter is not specified is
0.</p>

<p>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to
the log files about the activities of the server. At level
0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.
Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it
generates a small amount of information about operations
carried out.</p>

<p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p>Note that specifying this parameter here will override
the log level parameter in the smb.conf file.</p>

<p>-V|--version Prints the program version number.</p>

<p>-s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt; The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>-l|--log-basename=logdirectory Base directory name for
log/debug files. The extension &quot;.progname&quot; will be
appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
file is never removed by the client.</p>

<p>-v|--verbose gives verbose output.</p>

<p>-L|--locks causes smbstatus to only list locks.</p>

<p>-B|--byterange causes smbstatus to include byte range
locks.</p>

<p>-p|--processes print a list of smbd(8) processes and
exit. Useful for scripting.</p>

<p>-S|--shares causes smbstatus to only list shares.</p>

<p>-?|--help Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>-u|--user=&lt;username&gt; selects information relevant
to username only.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO smbd(8) and smb.conf(5).</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
