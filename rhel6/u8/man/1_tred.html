<p>NAME tred - transitive reduction filter for directed
graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tred [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tred computes the transitive reduction of
directed graphs, and prints the resulting graphs to standard
output. This removes edges implied by transitivity. Nodes
and subgraphs are not otherwise affected. The meaning and
validity of the reduced graphs is application depen- dent.
tred is particularly useful as a preprocessor to dot to
reduce clutter in dense layouts.</p>

<p>Undirected graphs are silently ignored.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot
format. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>

<p>BUGS Using bitmaps internally would substantially
decrease running time.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If a graph has cycles, its transitive
reduction is not uniquely defined. In this case tred emits a
warning.</p>
