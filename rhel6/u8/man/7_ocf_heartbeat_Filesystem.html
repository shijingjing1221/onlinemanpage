<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_Filesystem - Manages filesystem
mounts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Filesystem [start | stop | monitor | meta-data
| validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Resource script for Filesystem. It manages a
Filesystem on a shared storage medium.</p>

<p>The standard monitor operation of depth 0 (also known as
probe) checks if the filesystem is mounted. If you want
deeper tests, set OCF_CHECK_LEVEL to one of the following
values:</p>

<p>10: read first 16 blocks of the device (raw read)</p>

<p>This doesn&acute;t exercise the filesystem at all, but
the device on which the filesystem lives. This is noop for
non-block devices such as NFS, SMBFS, or bind mounts.</p>

<p>20: test if a status file can be written and read</p>

<p>The status file must be writable by root. This is not
always the case with an NFS mount, as NFS exports usually
have the &quot;root_squash&quot; option set. In such a
setup, you must either use read-only monitoring (depth=10),
export with &quot;no_root_squash&quot; on your NFS server,
or grant world write permissions on the directory where the
status file is to be placed.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS device The name of block device for
the filesystem, or -U, -L options for mount, or NFS mount
specification.</p>

<p>(required, string, no default)</p>

<p>directory The mount point for the filesystem.</p>

<p>(required, string, no default)</p>

<p>fstype The type of filesystem to be mounted.</p>

<p>(required, string, no default)</p>

<p>options Any extra options to be given as -o options to
mount.</p>

<p>For bind mounts, add &quot;bind&quot; here and set
fstype to &quot;none&quot;. We will do the right thing for
options such as &quot;bind,ro&quot;.</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>statusfile_prefix The prefix to be used for a status
file for resource monitoring with depth 20. If you
don&acute;t specify this parameter, all status files will be
created in a separate directory.</p>

<p>(optional, string, default
&quot;.Filesystem_status/&quot;)</p>

<p>run_fsck Specify how to decide whether to run fsck or
not.</p>

<p>&quot;auto&quot; : decide to run fsck depending on the
fstype(default) &quot;force&quot; : always run fsck
regardless of the fstype &quot;no&quot; : do not run fsck
ever.</p>

<p>(optional, string, default &quot;auto&quot;)</p>

<p>fast_stop Normally, we expect no users of the filesystem
and the stop operation to finish quickly. If you cannot
control the filesystem users easily and want to prevent the
stop action from failing, then set this parameter to
&quot;no&quot; and add an appropriate timeout for the stop
operation.</p>

<p>(optional, boolean, default yes)</p>

<p>force_clones The use of a clone setup for local
filesystems is forbidden by default. For special setups like
glusterfs, cloning a mount of a local device with a
filesystem like ext4 or xfs independently on several nodes
is a valid use case.</p>

<p>Only set this to &quot;true&quot; if you know what you
are doing!</p>

<p>(optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>force_unmount This option allows specifying how to
handle processes that are currently accessing the mount
directory.</p>

<p>&quot;true&quot; : Default value, kill processes
accessing mount point &quot;safe&quot; : Kill processes
accessing mount point using methods that avoid functions
that could potentially block during process detection
&quot;false&quot; : Do not kill any processes.</p>

<p>The &acute;safe&acute; option uses shell logic to walk
the /procs/ directory for pids using the mount point while
the default option uses the fuser cli tool. fuser is known
to perform operations that can potentially block if
unresponsive nfs mounts are in use on the system.</p>

<p>(optional, boolean, default true)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
60.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
60.</p>

<p>notify Suggested minimum timeout: 60.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 40. Suggested interval: 20.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
Filesystem resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive p_Filesystem ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem params
device=string directory=string fstype=string op monitor
depth=&quot;0&quot; timeout=&quot;40&quot;
interval=&quot;20&quot;</p>
