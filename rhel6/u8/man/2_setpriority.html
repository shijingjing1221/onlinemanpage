<p>GETPRIORITY(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETPRIORITY(2)</p>

<p>NAME getpriority, setpriority - get/set program
scheduling priority</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getpriority(int which, int who); int setpriority(int
which, int who, int prio);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The scheduling priority of the process,
process group, or user, as indicated by which and who is
obtained with the getpriority() call and set with the
setpriority() call.</p>

<p>The value which is one of PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, or
PRIO_USER, and who is interpreted relative to which (a
process identifier for PRIO_PROCESS, process group
identifier for PRIO_PGRP, and a user ID for PRIO_USER). A
zero value for who denotes (respectively) the calling
process, the process group of the calling process, or the
real user ID of the calling process. Prio is a value in the
range -20 to 19 (but see the Notes below). The default
priority is 0; lower priorities cause more favorable
scheduling.</p>

<p>The getpriority() call returns the highest priority
(lowest numerical value) enjoyed by any of the specified
processes. The setpriority() call sets the priorities of all
of the specified processes to the spec- ified value. Only
the superuser may lower priorities.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Since getpriority() can legitimately return
the value -1, it is neces- sary to clear the external
variable errno prior to the call, then check it afterwards
to determine if -1 is an error or a legitimate value. The
setpriority() call returns 0 if there is no error, or -1 if
there is.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL which was not one of PRIO_PROCESS,
PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER.</p>

<p>ESRCH No process was located using the which and who
values specified.</p>

<p>In addition to the errors indicated above, setpriority()
may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The caller attempted to lower a process priority,
but did not have the required privilege (on Linux: did not
have the CAP_SYS_NICE capability). Since Linux 2.6.12, this
error only occurs if the caller attempts to set a process
priority outside the range of the RLIMIT_NICE soft resource
limit of the target process; see getrlimit(2) for
details.</p>

<p>EPERM A process was located, but its effective user ID
did not match either the effective or the real user ID of
the caller, and was not privileged (on Linux: did not have
the CAP_SYS_NICE capabil- ity). But see NOTES below.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD (these function calls first
appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES A child created by fork(2) inherits its parents
nice value. The nice value is preserved across
execve(2).</p>

<p>The degree to which their relative nice value affects
the scheduling of processes varies across Unix systems, and,
on Linux, across kernel ver- sions. Starting with kernel
2.6.23, Linux adopted an algorithm that causes relative
differences in nice values to have a much stronger effect.
This causes very low nice values (+19) to truly provide
little CPU to a process whenever there is any other higher
priority load on the system, and makes high nice values
(-20) deliver most of the CPU to applications that require
it (e.g., some audio applications).</p>

<p>The details on the condition for EPERM depend on the
system. The above description is what POSIX.1-2001 says, and
seems to be followed on all System V-like systems. Linux
kernels before 2.6.12 required the real or effective user ID
of the caller to match the real user of the pro- cess who
(instead of its effective user ID). Linux 2.6.12 and later
require the effective user ID of the caller to match the
real or effec- tive user ID of the process who. All BSD-like
systems (SunOS 4.1.3, Ultrix 4.2, 4.3BSD, FreeBSD 4.3,
OpenBSD-2.5, ...) behave in the same manner as Linux 2.6.12
and later.</p>

<p>The actual priority range varies between kernel
versions. Linux before 1.3.36 had -infinity..15. Since
kernel 1.3.43 Linux has the range -20..19. Within the
kernel, nice values are actually represented using the
corresponding range 40..1 (since negative numbers are error
codes) and these are the values employed by the
setpriority() and getprior- ity() system calls. The glibc
wrapper functions for these system calls handle the
translations between the user-land and kernel representa-
tions of the nice value according to the formula unice = 20
- knice.</p>

<p>On some systems, the range of nice values is
-20..20.</p>

<p>Including &lt;sys/time.h&gt; is not required these days,
but increases porta- bility. (Indeed, &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;
defines the rusage structure with fields of type struct
timeval defined in &lt;sys/time.h&gt;.)</p>
