<p>NAME ipsec_rsasigkey - generate RSA signature key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec rsasigkey [--verbose] [--seeddev device]
[--seed numbits] [--configdir nssdbdir] [--password
nsspassword] [--hostname hostname] [nbits]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rsasigkey generates an RSA public/private
key pair, suitable for digital signatures, of (exactly)
nbits bits (that is, two primes each of exactly nbits/2
bits, and related numbers) and emits it on standard output
as ASCII (mostly hex) data. nbits must be a multiple of
16.</p>

<p>The public exponent is forced to the value 3, which has
important speed advantages for signature checking. Beware
that the resulting keys have known weaknesses as encryption
keys and should not be used for that purpose.</p>

<p>The --verbose option makes rsasigkey give a running
commentary on standard error. By default, it works in
silence until it is ready to generate output.</p>

<p>The --seeddev option specifies a source for random bits
used to seed the crypto library&acute;s RNG. The default is
/dev/random (see random(4)). FreeS/WAN and Openswan without
NSS support used this option to specify the random source
used to directly create keys. Libreswan only uses it to seed
the NSS crypto libraries RNG. Under Linux with hardware
random support, special devices might show up as /dev/*rng*
devices. However, these should never be accessed directly
using this option, as hardware failures could lead to
extremely non-random values (streams of zeroes have been
observed in the wild)</p>

<p>The --seedbits option specifies how many seed bits are
pulled from the random device to seed the NSS PRNG. The
default of 480bit comes from FIPS requirements. Seed bits
are rounded up to a multiple of 8.</p>

<p>The use of a different random device or a reduction of
seedbits from the default value is prevented when the system
is running in FIPS mode.</p>

<p>The --configdir option specifies the nss configuration
directory to use. This is the directory where the NSS
certificate, key and security modules databases reside. The
default value is /etc/ipsec.d.</p>

<p>The --password option specifies the nss cryptographic
module authentication password if the NSS module has been
configured to require it. A password is required by hardware
tokens and also by the internal software token module when
configured to run in FIPS mode. If the argument is
configdir/nsspassword, the password comes from that file;
otherwise argument is the password.</p>

<p>The --hostname option specifies what host name to use in
the first line of the output (see below); the default is
what gethostname(2) returns.</p>

<p>The output format looks like this (with long numbers
trimmed down for clarity):</p>

<p># RSA 2048 bits xy.example.com Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
# for signatures only, UNSAFE FOR ENCRYPTION
#pubkey=0sAQOF8tZ2NZt...Y1P+buFuFn/ Modulus:
0xcc2a86fcf440...cf1011abb82d1 PublicExponent: 0x03 #

Exponent1: 0xa31536a4fb...536d98adda7f7 Exponent2:
0x8e70b5ad8d...9142168d7dcc7 Coefficient:
0xafb761d001...0c13e98d98</p>

<p>The first (comment) line, indicating the nature and date
of the key, and giving a host name, is used by
ipsec_showhostkey(8) when generating some forms of key
output.</p>

<p>The commented-out pubkey= line contains the public key,
the public exponent and the modulus combined in
approximately RFC 2537 format (the one deviation is that the
combined value is given with a 0s prefix, rather than in
unadorned base-64), suitable for use in the ipsec.conf
file.</p>

<p>The Modulus, PublicExponent and PrivateExponent lines
give the basic signing and verification data.</p>

<p>The Prime1 and Prime2 lines give the primes themselves
(aka p and q), largest first. The Exponent1 and Exponent2
lines give the private exponent mod p-1 and q-1
respectively. The Coefficient line gives the Chinese
Remainder Theorem coefficient, which is the inverse of q,
mod p. These additional numbers (which must all be kept as
secret as the private exponent) are precomputed aids to
rapid signature generation. When NSS is used, these values
are not available outside the NSS security database
(software token or hardware token) and are instead filled in
with the CKA_ID.</p>

<p>No attempt is made to break long lines.</p>

<p>The US patent on the RSA algorithm expired 20 Sept
2000.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ipsec rsasigkey --verbose 4096 &gt;mykey.txt
generates a 4096-bit signature key and puts it in the file
mykey.txt, with running commentary on standard error. The
file contents can be inserted verbatim into a suitable entry
in the ipsec.secrets file (see ipsec_secrets(5)), and the
public key can then be extracted and edited into the
ipsec.conf (see ipsec_showhostkey(8)).</p>

<p>HISTORY Originally written for the Linux FreeS/WAN
project &lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.
Updated for the Libreswan Project by Paul Wouters.</p>

<p>The --round and --noopt options were obsoleted as these
were only used with the old non-library crypto code</p>

<p>The --random device is only used for seeding the crypto
library, not for direct random to generate keys</p>

<p>BUGS There is an internal limit on nbits, currently
20000.</p>

<p>rsasigkey&acute;s run time is difficult to predict,
since /dev/random output can be arbitrarily delayed if the
system&acute;s entropy pool is low on randomness, and the
time taken by the search for primes is also somewhat
unpredictable. Specifically, embedded systems and most
virtual machines are low on entropy. In such a situation,
consider generating the RSA key on another machine, and
copying ipsec.secrets and the ipsec.d/*db files to the
embedded platform. Note that NSS embeds the full path in the
DB files, so the path on proxy machine must be identical to
the path on the destination machine.</p>
