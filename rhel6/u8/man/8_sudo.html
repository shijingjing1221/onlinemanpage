<p>NAME sudo, sudoedit - execute a command as another
user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sudo -h | -K | -k | -V sudo -v [-AknS] [-g
group name | #gid] [-p prompt] [-u user name | #uid] sudo
-l[l] [-AknS] [-g group name | #gid] [-p prompt] [-U user
name] [-u user name | #uid] [command] sudo [-AbEHnPS] [-C
fd] [-g group name | #gid] [-p prompt] [-r role] [-t type]
[-u user name | #uid] [VAR=value] -i | -s [command] sudoedit
[-AnS] [-C fd] [-g group name | #gid] [-p prompt] [-u user
name | #uid] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sudo allows a permitted user to execute a
command as the superuser or another user, as specified by
the security policy.</p>

<p>sudo supports a plugin architecture for security
policies and input/out- put logging. Third parties can
develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging
plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The
default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via
the file /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP. See the PLUGINS section
for more information.</p>

<p>The security policy determines what privileges, if any,
a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users
authenticate themselves with a password or another
authentication mechanism. If authentication is required,
sudo will exit if the user s password is not entered within
a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific;
the default password prompt timeout for the sudoers security
policy is 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Security policies may support credential caching to
allow the user to run sudo again for a period of time
without requiring authentication. The sudoers policy caches
credentials for 5 minutes, unless overridden in sudoers(5).
By running sudo with the -v option, a user can update the
cached credentials without running a command.</p>

<p>When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described
below), is implied.</p>

<p>Security policies may log successful and failed attempts
to use sudo. If an I/O plugin is configured, the running
commands input and output may be logged as well.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-A Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read
it from the users terminal. If the -A (askpass) option is
speci- fied, a (possibly graphical) helper program is
executed to read the users password and output the password
to the stan- dard output. If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment
variable is set, it specifies the path to the helper
program. Otherwise, if /etc/sudo.conf contains a line
specifying the askpass pro- gram, that value will be used.
For example:</p>

<p># Path to askpass helper program Path askpass
/usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass</p>

<p>If no askpass program is available, sudo will exit with
an error.</p>

<p>-b The -b (background) option tells sudo to run the
given com- mand in the background. Note that if you use the
-b option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the
process. Most interactive commands will fail to work
properly in back- ground mode.</p>

<p>-C fd Normally, sudo will close all open file
descriptors other than standard input, standard output and
standard error. The -C (close from) option allows the user
to specify a starting point above the standard error (file
descriptor three). Val- ues less than three are not
permitted. The security policy may restrict the users
ability to use the -C option. The sudoers policy only
permits use of the -C option when the administrator has
enabled the closefrom_override option.</p>

<p>-E The -E (preserve environment) option indicates to the
secu- rity policy that the user wishes to preserve their
existing environment variables. The security policy may
return an error if the -E option is specified and the user
does not have permission to preserve the environment.</p>

<p>-e The -e (edit) option indicates that, instead of
running a command, the user wishes to edit one or more
files. In lieu of a command, the string &quot;sudoedit&quot;
is used when consulting the security policy. If the user is
authorized by the pol- icy, the following steps are
taken:</p>

<p>1. Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited
with the owner set to the invoking user.</p>

<p>2. The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the
temporary files. The sudoers policy uses the SUDO_EDITOR,
VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables (in that order). If
none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are set, the first
program listed in the editor sudoers(5) option is used.</p>

<p>3. If they have been modified, the temporary files are
copied back to their original location and the temporary
versions are removed.</p>

<p>If the specified file does not exist, it will be
created. Note that unlike most commands run by sudo, the
editor is run with the invoking users environment
unmodified. If, for some reason, sudo is unable to update a
file with its edited version, the user will receive a
warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary
file.</p>

<p>-g group Normally, sudo runs a command with the primary
group set to the one specified by the password database for
the user the command is being run as (by default, root). The
-g (group) option causes sudo to run the command with the
primary group set to group instead. To specify a gid instead
of a group name, use #gid. When running commands as a gid,
many shells require that the # be escaped with a backslash (
). If no -u option is specified, the command will be run as
the invoking user (not root). In either case, the primary
group will be set to group.</p>

<p>-H The -H (HOME) option requests that the security
policy set the HOME environment variable to the home
directory of the target user (root by default) as specified
by the password database. Depending on the policy, this may
be the default behavior.</p>

<p>-h The -h (help) option causes sudo to print a short
help mes- sage to the standard output and exit.</p>

<p>-i [command] The -i (simulate initial login) option runs
the shell speci- fied by the password database entry of the
target user as a login shell. This means that login-specific
resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by
the shell. If a command is specified, it is passed to the
shell for execution via the shell s -c option. If no command
is specified, an interactive shell is executed. sudo
attempts to change to that user s home directory before
running the shell. The security policy shall initialize the
environment to a minimal set of variables, similar to what
is present when a user logs in. The Command Environment
section in the sudoers(5) manual documents how the -i option
affects the environment in which a command is run when the
sudoers policy is in use.</p>

<p>-K The -K (sure kill) option is like -k except that it
removes the users cached credentials entirely and may not be
used in conjunction with a command or other option. This
option does not require a password. Not all security
policies support credential caching.</p>

<p>-k [command] When used alone, the -k (kill) option to
sudo invalidates the users cached credentials. The next time
sudo is run a pass- word will be required. This option does
not require a pass- word and was added to allow a user to
revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file. Not all
security policies support cre- dential caching.</p>

<p>When used in conjunction with a command or an option
that may require a password, the -k option will cause sudo
to ignore the users cached credentials. As a result, sudo
will prompt for a password (if one is required by the
security policy) and will not update the user s cached
credentials.</p>

<p>-l[l] [command] If no command is specified, the -l
(list) option will list the allowed (and forbidden) commands
for the invoking user (or the user specified by the -U
option) on the current host. If a command is specified and
is permitted by the security policy, the fully-qualified
path to the command is displayed along with any command line
arguments. If command is speci- fied but not allowed, sudo
will exit with a status value of 1. If the -l option is
specified with an l argument (i.e. -ll), or if -l is
specified multiple times, a longer list format is used.</p>

<p>-n The -n (non-interactive) option prevents sudo from
prompting the user for a password. If a password is required
for the command to run, sudo will display an error message
and exit.</p>

<p>-P The -P (preserve group vector) option causes sudo to
preserve the invoking users group vector unaltered. By
default, the sudoers policy will initialize the group vector
to the list of groups the target user is in. The real and
effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the
target user.</p>

<p>-p prompt The -p (prompt) option allows you to override
the default password prompt and use a custom one. The
following percent (%) escapes are supported by the sudoers
policy:</p>

<p>%H expanded to the host name including the domain name
(on if the machines host name is fully qualified or the fqdn
option is set in sudoers(5))</p>

<p>%h expanded to the local host name without the domain
name</p>

<p>%p expanded to the name of the user whose password is
being requested (respects the rootpw, targetpw, and runaspw
flags in sudoers(5))</p>

<p>%U expanded to the login name of the user the command
will be run as (defaults to root unless the -u option is
also specified)</p>

<p>%u expanded to the invoking users login name</p>

<p>%% two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a
sin- gle % character</p>

<p>The prompt specified by the -p option will override the
sys- tem password prompt on systems that support PAM unless
the passprompt_override flag is disabled in sudoers.</p>

<p>-r role The -r (role) option causes the new (SELinux)
security con- text to have the role specified by role.</p>

<p>-S The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the
password from the standard input instead of the terminal
device. The pass- word must be followed by a newline
character.</p>

<p>-s [command] The -s (shell) option runs the shell
specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or
the shell as specified in the password database. If a
command is specified, it is passed to the shell for
execution via the shells -c option. If no command is
specified, an interactive shell is executed.</p>

<p>-t type The -t (type) option causes the new (SELinux)
security con- text to have the type specified by type. If no
type is spec- ified, the default type is derived from the
specified role.</p>

<p>-U user The -U (other user) option is used in
conjunction with the -l option to specify the user whose
privileges should be listed. The security policy may
restrict listing other users privi- leges. The sudoers
policy only allows root or a user with the ALL privilege on
the current host to use this option.</p>

<p>-u user The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the
specified command as a user other than root. To specify a
uid instead of a user name, #uid. When running commands as a
uid, many shells require that the # be escaped with a
backslash ( ). Security policies may restrict uids to those
listed in the password database. The sudoers policy allows
uids that are not in the password database as long as the
targetpw option is not set. Other security policies may not
support this.</p>

<p>-V The -V (version) option causes sudo to print its
version string and the version string of the security policy
plugin and any I/O plugins. If the invoking user is already
root the -V option will display the arguments passed to
configure when sudo was built and plugins may display more
verbose information such as default options.</p>

<p>-v When given the -v (validate) option, sudo will update
the users cached credentials, authenticating the users
password if necessary. For the sudoers plugin, this extends
the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever the
timeout is set to by the security policy) but does not run a
command. Not all security policies support cached
credentials.</p>

<p>-- The -- option indicates that sudo should stop
processing com- mand line arguments.</p>

<p>Environment variables to be set for the command may also
be passed on the command line in the form of VAR=value, e.g.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkg/lib. Variables passed on the
command line are subject to the same restrictions as normal
environment variables with one important exception. If the
setenv option is set in sudoers, the command to be run has
the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user
may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden. See
sudoers(5) for more information.</p>

<p>COMMAND EXECUTION When sudo executes a command, the
security policy specifies the execution envionment for the
command. Typically, the real and effective uid and gid are
set to match those of the target user, as specified in the
pass- word database, and the group vector is initialized
based on the group database (unless the -P option was
specified).</p>

<p>The following parameters may be specified by security
policy:</p>

<p>&middot; real and effective user ID</p>

<p>&middot; real and effective group ID</p>

<p>&middot; supplementary group IDs</p>

<p>&middot; the environment list</p>

<p>&middot; current working directory</p>

<p>&middot; file creation mode mask (umask)</p>

<p>&middot; SELinux role and type</p>

<p>&middot; scheduling priority (aka nice value)</p>

<p>Process model When sudo runs a command, it calls
fork(2), sets up the execution envi- ronment as described
above, and calls the execve system call in the child
process. The main sudo process waits until the command has
completed, then passes the commands exit status to the
security policys close method and exits. If an I/O logging
plugin is configured, a new pseudo- terminal (pty) is
created and a second sudo process is used to relay job
control signals between the users existing pty and the new
pty the command is being run in. This extra process makes it
possible to, for example, suspend and resume the command.
Without it, the command would be in what POSIX terms an
orphaned process group and it would not receive any job
control signals.</p>

<p>Signal handling Because the command is run as a child of
the sudo process, sudo will relay signals it receives to the
command. Unless the command is being run in a new pty, the
SIGHUP, SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals are not relayed unless
they are sent by a user process, not the kernel. Otherwise,
the command would receive SIGINT twice every time the user
entered control-C. Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and
SIGKILL, cannot be caught and thus will not be relayed to
the command. As a general rule, SIGTSTP should be used
instead of SIGSTOP when you wish to suspend a command being
run by sudo.</p>

<p>As a special case, sudo will not relay signals that were
sent by the com- mand it is running. This prevents the
command from accidentally killing itself. On some systems,
the reboot(8) command sends SIGTERM to all non- system
processes other than itself before rebooting the systyem.
This prevents sudo from relaying the SIGTERM signal it
received back to reboot(8), which might then exit before the
system was actually rebooted, leaving it in a half-dead
state similar to single user mode. Note, how- ever, that
this check only applies to the command run by sudo and not
any other processes that the command may create. As a
result, running a script that calls reboot(8) or shutdown(8)
via sudo may cause the system to end up in this undefined
state unless the reboot(8) or shutdown(8) are run using the
exec() family of functions instead of system() (which
interposes a shell between the command and the calling
process).</p>

<p>PLUGINS Plugins are dynamically loaded based on the
contents of the /etc/sudo.conf file. If no /etc/sudo.conf
file is present, or it con- tains no Plugin lines, sudo will
use the traditional sudoers security policy and I/O logging,
which corresponds to the following /etc/sudo.conf file.</p>

<p># # Default /etc/sudo.conf file # # Format: # Plugin
plugin_name plugin_path plugin_options ... # Path askpass
/path/to/askpass # Path noexec /path/to/sudo_noexec.so #
Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@warn # Set
disable_coredump true # # The plugin_path is relative to
/usr/libexec unless # fully qualified. # The plugin_name
corresponds to a global symbol in the plugin # that contains
the plugin interface structure. # The plugin_options are
optional. # Plugin policy_plugin sudoers.so Plugin io_plugin
sudoers.so</p>

<p>A Plugin line consists of the Plugin keyword, followed
by the symbol_name and the path to the shared object
containing the plugin. The symbol_name is the name of the
struct policy_plugin or struct io_plugin in the plugin
shared object. The path may be fully qualified or relative.
If not fully qualified it is relative to the /usr/libexec
directory. Any addi- tional parameters after the path are
passed as arguments to the plugins open function. Lines that
dont begin with Plugin, Path, Debug, or Set are silently
ignored.</p>

<p>For more information, see the sudo_plugin(8) manual.</p>

<p>PATHS A Path line consists of the Path keyword, followed
by the name of the path to set and its value. E.g.</p>

<p>Path noexec /usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so Path askpass
/usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass</p>

<p>The following plugin-agnostic paths may be set in the
/etc/sudo.conf file:</p>

<p>askpass The fully qualified path to a helper program
used to read the users password when no terminal is
available. This may be the case when sudo is executed from a
graphical (as opposed to text-based) application. The
program specified by askpass should display the argument
passed to it as the prompt and write the users password to
the standard output. The value of askpass may be overridden
by the SUDO_ASKPASS environment vari- able.</p>

<p>noexec The fully-qualified path to a shared library
containing dummy versions of the execv(), execve() and
fexecve() library func- tions that just return an error.
This is used to implement the noexec functionality on
systems that support LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent. Defaults
to /usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so.</p>

<p>DEBUG FLAGS sudo versions 1.8.4 and higher support a
flexible debugging framework that can help track down what
sudo is doing internally if there is a problem.</p>

<p>A Debug line consists of the Debug keyword, followed by
the name of the program to debug (sudo, visudo, sudoreplay),
the debug file name and a comma-separated list of debug
flags. The debug flag syntax used by sudo and the sudoers
plugin is subsystem@priority but the plugin is free to use a
different format so long as it does not include a comma
(,).</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@warn,plugin@info</p>

<p>would log all debugging statements at the warn level and
higher in addi- tion to those at the info level for the
plugin subsystem.</p>

<p>Currently, only one Debug entry per program is
supported. The sudo Debug entry is shared by the sudo front
end, sudoedit and the plugins. A future release may add
support for per-plugin Debug lines and/or support for
multiple debugging files for a single program.</p>

<p>The priorities used by the sudo front end, in order of
decreasing sever- ity, are: crit, err, warn, notice, diag,
info, trace and debug. Each priority, when specified, also
includes all priorities higher than it. For example, a
priority of notice would include debug messages logged at
notice and higher.</p>

<p>The following subsystems are used by the sudo
front-end:</p>

<p>all matches every subsystem</p>

<p>args command line argument processing</p>

<p>conv user conversation</p>

<p>edit sudoedit</p>

<p>exec command execution</p>

<p>main sudo main function</p>

<p>netif network interface handling</p>

<p>pcomm communication with the plugin</p>

<p>plugin plugin configuration</p>

<p>pty pseudo-tty related code</p>

<p>selinux SELinux-specific handling</p>

<p>util utility functions</p>

<p>utmp utmp handling</p>

<p>EXIT VALUE Upon successful execution of a program, the
exit status from sudo will simply be the exit status of the
program that was executed.</p>

<p>Otherwise, sudo exits with a value of 1 if there is a
configuration/per- mission problem or if sudo cannot execute
the given command. In the lat- ter case the error string is
printed to the standard error. If sudo can- not stat(2) one
or more entries in the users PATH, an error is printed on
stderr. (If the directory does not exist or if it is not
really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is
printed.) This should not happen under normal circumstances.
The most common reason for stat(2) to return permission
denied is if you are running an auto- mounter and one of the
directories in your PATH is on a machine that is currently
unreachable.</p>

<p>SECURITY NOTES sudo tries to be safe when executing
external commands.</p>

<p>To prevent command spoofing, sudo checks &quot;.&quot;
and &quot;&quot; (both denoting cur- rent directory) last
when searching for a command in the users PATH (if one or
both are in the PATH). Note, however, that the actual PATH
envi- ronment variable is not modified and is passed
unchanged to the program that sudo executes.</p>

<p>Please note that sudo will normally only log the command
it explicitly runs. If a user runs a command such as sudo su
or sudo sh, subsequent commands run from that shell are not
subject to sudos security policy. The same is true for
commands that offer shell escapes (including most editors).
If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands will have
their input and/or output logged, but there will not be
traditional logs for those commands. Because of this, care
must be taken when giving users access to commands via sudo
to verify that the command does not inadver- tently give the
user an effective root shell. For more information, please
see the PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES section in sudoers(5).</p>

<p>To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive
information, sudo dis- ables core dumps by default while it
is executing (they are re-enabled for the command that is
run). To aid in debugging sudo crashes, you may wish to
re-enable core dumps by setting disable_coredump to false in
the /etc/sudo.conf file as follows:</p>

<p>Set disable_coredump false</p>

<p>Note that by default, most operating systems disable
core dumps from setuid programs, which includes sudo. To
actually get a sudo core file you may need to enable core
dumps for setuid processes. On BSD and Linux systems this is
accomplished via the sysctl command, on Solaris the core-
adm command can be used.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT sudo utilizes the following environment
variables. The security policy has control over the actual
content of the command s environment.</p>

<p>EDITOR Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode if
neither SUDO_EDITOR nor VISUAL is set.</p>

<p>MAIL In -i mode or when env_reset is enabled in sudoers,
set to the mail spool of the target user.</p>

<p>HOME Set to the home directory of the target user if -i
or -H are specified, env_reset or always_set_home are set in
sudoers, or when the -s option is specified and set_home is
set in sudoers.</p>

<p>PATH May be overridden by the security policy.</p>

<p>SHELL Used to determine shell to run with -s option.</p>

<p>SUDO_ASKPASS Specifies the path to a helper program used
to read the password if no terminal is available or if the
-A option is specified.</p>

<p>SUDO_COMMAND Set to the command run by sudo.</p>

<p>SUDO_EDITOR Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit)
mode.</p>

<p>SUDO_GID Set to the group ID of the user who invoked
sudo.</p>

<p>SUDO_PROMPT Used as the default password prompt.</p>

<p>SUDO_PS1 If set, PS1 will be set to its value for the
program being run.</p>

<p>SUDO_UID Set to the user ID of the user who invoked
sudo.</p>

<p>SUDO_USER Set to the login name of the user who invoked
sudo.</p>

<p>USER Set to the target user (root unless the -u option
is specified).</p>

<p>VISUAL Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode if
SUDO_EDITOR is not set.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sudo.conf sudo front end configuration</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Note: the following examples assume a properly
configured security pol- icy.</p>

<p>To get a file listing of an unreadable directory:</p>

<p>$ sudo ls /usr/local/protected</p>

<p>To list the home directory of user yaz on a machine
where the file system holding ~yaz is not exported as
root:</p>

<p>$ sudo -u yaz ls ~yaz</p>

<p>To edit the index.html file as user www:</p>

<p>$ sudo -u www vi ~www/htdocs/index.html</p>

<p>To view system logs only accessible to root and users in
the adm group:</p>

<p>$ sudo -g adm view /var/log/syslog</p>

<p>To run an editor as jim with a different primary
group:</p>

<p>$ sudo -u jim -g audio vi ~jim/sound.txt</p>

<p>To shut down a machine:</p>

<p>$ sudo shutdown -r +15 &quot;quick reboot&quot;</p>

<p>To make a usage listing of the directories in the /home
partition. Note that this runs the commands in a sub-shell
to make the cd and file redi- rection work.</p>

<p>$ sudo sh -c &quot;cd /home ; du -s * | sort -rn &gt;

<p>HISTORY See the HISTORY file in the sudo distribution
(http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/history.html) for a brief history
of sudo.</p>

<p>AUTHORS Many people have worked on sudo over the years;
this version consists of code written primarily by:</p>

<p>Todd C. Miller</p>

<p>See the CONTRIBUTORS file in the sudo distribution
(http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/contributors.html) for an
exhaustive list of people who have contributed to sudo.</p>

<p>CAVEATS There is no easy way to prevent a user from
gaining a root shell if that user is allowed to run
arbitrary commands via sudo. Also, many programs (such as
editors) allow the user to run commands via shell escapes,
thus avoiding sudos checks. However, on most systems it is
possible to pre- vent shell escapes with the sudoers(5)
plugin s noexec functionality.</p>

<p>It is not meaningful to run the cd command directly via
sudo, e.g.,</p>

<p>$ sudo cd /usr/local/protected</p>

<p>since when the command exits the parent process (your
shell) will still be the same. Please see the EXAMPLES
section for more information.</p>

<p>Running shell scripts via sudo can expose the same
kernel bugs that make setuid shell scripts unsafe on some
operating systems (if your OS has a /dev/fd/ directory,
setuid shell scripts are generally safe).</p>
