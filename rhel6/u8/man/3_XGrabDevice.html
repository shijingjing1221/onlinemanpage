<p>XGRABDEVICE(3) XGRABDEVICE(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGrabDevice, XUngrabDevice - grab/release the
specified extension device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XGrabDevice( Display *display, XDevice* device,
Window grab_window, Bool owner_events, int event_count,
XEventClass *event_list, int this_device_mode, int
other_devices_mode, Time time);</p>

<p>int XUngrabDevice( Display *display, XDevice *device,
Time time);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device to be grabbed or
released.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the id of a window to be
associated with the device.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether theevents from the deviceare to be reported as usual
or reported with respect to the grab windowif selected by
the event list.</p>

<p>event_count Specifies the number of elements in the
event_list array.</p>

<p>event_list Specifies a pointer to a list of event
classes that indicates which eventsthe client wishes to
receive. These event classes must have beenobtained
specifying the device being grabbed.</p>

<p>this_device_mode Specifies further processing of events
from this device.You can pass GrabModeSyncor
GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>other_devices_mode Specifies further processing of
events from other devices.You can pass GrabModeSyncor
GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time.You can pass either a timestamp
or CurrentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGrabDevice request actively grabs
control of the device and generates DeviceFocusIn and
DeviceFocusOut events. Further device events are reported
only to the grabbing client.XGrabDevice overrides any active
device grab by this client. event_list is a pointer to a
list of event classes. This list indicates which events the
client wishes to receive while the grab is active. If
owner_events is False, all generated device events are
reported with respect to grab_window if selected. If
owner_events is True and if a generated device event would
normally be reported to this client, it is reported
normally; otherwise, the event is reported with respect to
the grab_window, and is only reported if specified in the
event_list.</p>

<p>If the this_device_mode argument is GrabModeAsync,
device event processing continues as usual. If the device is
currently frozen by this client, then processing of device
events is resumed. If the this_device_mode argument is
GrabModeSync, the state of the device (as seen by client
applications) appears to freeze, and the X server generates
no further device events until the grabbing client issues a
releasing XAllowDeviceEvents call or until the device grab
is released. Actual device changes are not lost while the
device is frozen; they are simply queued in the server for
later processing.</p>

<p>If other_devices_mode is GrabModeAsync, processing of
events from other devices is unaffected by activation of the
grab. If other_devices_mode is GrabModeSync, the state of
all devices except the grabbed device (as seen by client
applications) appears to freeze, and the X server generates
no further events from those devices until the grabbing
client issues a releasing XAllowDeviceEvents call or until
the device grab is released. Actual events are not lost
while the devices are frozen; they are simply queued in the
server for later processing.</p>

<p>If the device is actively grabbed by some other client,
XGrabDevice fails and returns AlreadyGrabbed. If grab_window
is not viewable, it fails and returns GrabNotViewable. If
the device is frozen by an active grab of another client, it
fails and returns GrabFrozen. If the specified time is
earlier than the last-device-grab time or later than the
current X server time, it fails and returns GrabInvalidTime.
Otherwise, the last-device-grab time is set to the specified
time ( CurrentTime is replaced by the current X server
time).</p>

<p>If a grabbed device is closed by a client while an
active grab by that client is in effect, the active grab is
released. If the device is frozen only by an active grab of
the requesting client, it is thawed.</p>

<p>XGrabDevice can generate BadClass, BadDevice, BadValue,
and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XUngrabDevice request releases the device and any
queued events if this client has it actively grabbed from
either XGrabDevice or XGrabDeviceKey. If other devices are
frozen by the grab, XUngrabDevice thaws them.XUngrabDevice
does not release the device and any queued events if the
specified time is earlier than the last-device-grab time or
is later than the current X server time. It also generates
DeviceFocusIn and DeviceFocusOut events. The X server
automatically performs an UngrabDevice request if the event
window for an active device grab becomes not viewable.</p>

<p>XUngrabDevice can generate a BadDevice error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer
device.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
