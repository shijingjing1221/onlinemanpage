<p>GIT-REPACK(1) Git Manual GIT-REPACK(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-repack - Pack unpacked objects in a
repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git repack [-a] [-A] [-d] [-f] [-l] [-n] [-q]
[--window=N] [--depth=N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This script is used to combine all objects
that do not currently reside in a &quot;pack&quot;, into a
pack. It can also be used to re-organize existing packs into
a single, more efficient pack.</p>

<p>A pack is a collection of objects, individually
compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a
single file, with an associated index file.</p>

<p>Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems,
backup engines, disk storage, etc.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked
objects, pack everything referenced into a single pack.
Especially useful when packing a repository that is used for
private development. Use with -d. This will clean up the
objects that git prune leaves behind, but git fsck --full
shows as dangling.</p>

<p>Note that users fetching over dumb protocols will have
to fetch the whole new pack in order to get any contained
object, no matter how many other objects in that pack they
already have locally.</p>

<p>-A Same as -a, unless -d is used. Then any unreachable
objects in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects,
instead of being left in the old pack. Unreachable objects
are never intentionally added to a pack, even when
repacking. This option prevents unreachable objects from
being immediately deleted by way of being left in the old
pack and then removed. Instead, the loose unreachable
objects will be pruned according to normal expiry rules with
the next git gc invocation. See git-gc(1).</p>

<p>-d After packing, if the newly created packs make some
existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs. Also
run git prune-packed to remove redundant loose object
files.</p>

<p>-l Pass the --local option to git pack-objects. See
git-pack- objects(1).</p>

<p>-f Pass the --no-reuse-object option to
git-pack-objects, see git- pack-objects(1).</p>

<p>-q Pass the -q option to git pack-objects. See
git-pack-objects(1).</p>

<p>-n Do not update the server information with git
update-server-info. This option skips updating local catalog
files needed to publish this repository (or a direct copy of
it) over HTTP or FTP. See git- update-server-info(1).</p>

<p>--window=[N], --depth=[N] These two options affect how
the objects contained in the pack are stored using delta
compression. The objects are first internally sorted by
type, size and optionally names and compared against the
other objects within --window to see if using delta
compression saves space. --depth limits the maximum delta
depth; making it too deep affects the performance on the
unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied that
many times to get to the necessary object. The default value
for --window is 10 and --depth is 50.</p>

<p>--window-memory=[N] This option provides an additional
limit on top of --window; the window size will dynamically
scale down so as to not take up more than N bytes in memory.
This is useful in repositories with a mix of large and small
objects to not run out of memory with a large window, but
still be able to take advantage of the large window for the
smaller objects. The size can be suffixed with
&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;.
--window-memory=0 makes memory usage unlimited, which is the
default.</p>

<p>--max-pack-size=[N] Maximum size of each output pack
file. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
&quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is
limited to 1 MiB. If specified, multiple packfiles may be
created. The default is unlimited, unless the config
variable pack.packSizeLimit is set.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION By default, the command passes
--delta-base-offset option to git pack-objects; this
typically results in slightly smaller packs, but the
generated packs are incompatible with versions of Git older
than version 1.4.4. If you need to share your repository
with such ancient Git versions, either directly or via the
dumb http or rsync protocol, then you need to set the
configuration variable repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset to
&quot;false&quot; and repack. Access from old Git versions
over the native protocol is unaffected by this option as the
conversion is performed on the fly as needed in that
case.</p>
