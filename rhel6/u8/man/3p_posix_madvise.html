<p>POSIX_MADVISE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_MADVISE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_madvise - memory advisory information and
alignment control (ADVANCED REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_madvise(void *addr, size_t len, int
advice);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_madvise() function need only be
supported if either the Mem- ory Mapped Files or the Shared
Memory Objects options are supported.</p>

<p>The posix_madvise() function shall advise the
implementation on the expected behavior of the application
with respect to the data in the memory starting at address
addr, and continuing for len bytes. The implementation may
use this information to optimize handling of the specified
data. The posix_madvise() function shall have no effect on
the semantics of access to memory in the specified range,
although it may affect the performance of access.</p>

<p>The implementation may require that addr be a multiple
of the page size, which is the value returned by sysconf()
when the name value _SC_PAGESIZE is used.</p>

<p>The advice to be applied to the memory range is
specified by the advice parameter and may be one of the
following values:</p>

<p>POSIX_MADV_NORMAL</p>

<p>Specifies that the application has no advice to give on
its behavior with respect to the specified range. It is the
default characteristic if no advice is given for a range of
memory.</p>

<p>POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects to access the
specified range sequentially from lower addresses to higher
addresses.</p>

<p>POSIX_MADV_RANDOM</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects to access the
specified range in a random order.</p>

<p>POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects to access the
specified range in the near future.</p>

<p>POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED</p>

<p>Specifies that the application expects that it will not
access the specified range in the near future.</p>

<p>These values are defined in the &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
header.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, posix_madvise()
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_madvise() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of advice is invalid.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Addresses in the range starting at addr and
continuing for len bytes are partly or completely outside
the range allowed for the address space of the calling
process.</p>

<p>The posix_madvise() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of addr is not a multiple of the value
returned by sysconf() when the name value _SC_PAGESIZE is
used.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of len is zero.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The posix_madvise() function is part
of the Advisory Information option and need not be provided
on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
