<p>NAME scrub - write patterns on disk/file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scrub [OPTIONS] special-file scrub [OPTIONS]
file scrub -X [OPTIONS] directory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Scrub iteratively writes patterns on files
or disk devices to make retrieving the data more difficult.
Scrub operates in one of three modes:</p>

<p>1) The special file corresponding to an entire disk is
scrubbed and all data on it is destroyed. This mode is
selected if file is a character or block special file. This
is the most effective method.</p>

<p>2) A regular file is scrubbed and only the data in the
file (and optionally its name in the directory entry) is
destroyed. The file size is rounded up to fill out the last
file system block. This mode is selected if file is a
regular file. See CAVEATS below.</p>

<p>3) directory is created and filled with files until the
file system is full, then the files are scrubbed as in 2).
This mode is selected with the -X option. See CAVEATS
below.</p>

<p>Scrub accepts the following options:</p>

<p>-v, --version Print scrub version and exit.</p>

<p>-r, --remove Remove the file after scrubbing.</p>

<p>-p, --pattern
nnsa|dod|bsi|old|fastold|gutmann|random|random2 Select the
patterns to write. nnsa selects patterns compliant with NNSA
Policy Letter NAP-14.x; dod selects patterns compliant with
DoD 5220.22-M; bsi selects patterns recommended by the Ger-
man Center of Security in Information Technologies
(http://www.bsi.bund.de); old selects pre-version 1.7 scrub
pat- terns; and fastold is old without the random pass.
gutmann is a 35-pass sequence described in Gutmanns paper
cited below. See STANDARDS below for more detail. random is
a single random pass. random2 is two random passes. Default:
nnsa.</p>

<p>-b, --blocksize blocksize Perform read(2) and write(2)
calls using the specified blocksize (in bytes). K, M, or G
may be appended to the number to change the units to
KiBytes, MiBytes, or GiBytes, respectively. Default: 1M.</p>

<p>-f, --force Scrub even if target contains signature
indicating it has already been scrubbed.</p>

<p>-S, --no-signature Do not write scrub signature. Scrub
will not be able to ascer- tain if the disk has already been
scrubbed.</p>

<p>-X, --freespace Create specified directory and fill it
with files until write returns ENOSPC (file system full),
then scrub the files as usual. The size of each file can be
set with -s, otherwise it will be the maximum file size
creatable given the users file size limit or 1g if
umlimited.</p>

<p>-D, --dirent newname After scrubbing the file, scrub its
name in the directory entry, then rename it to the new name.
The scrub patterns used on the directory entry are
constrained by the operating system and thus are not
compliant with cited standards.</p>

<p>-s, --device-size size Override the device size (in
bytes). Without this option, scrub determines media capacity
using OS-specific ioctl(2) calls. K, M, or G may be appended
to the number to change the units to KiBytes, MiBytes, or
GiBytes, respectively.</p>

<p>-E, --extent-only When scrubbing regular files, scrub
only the file extents. This option is useful in combination
with large sparse files. If used, scrub will skip the holes
in the sparse file. Use this option with caution, the result
may not be compliant with cited standards and information
about the actual on-disk data alloca- tion may leak since
only the allocated parts will be scrubbed.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Scrub may be insufficient to thwart heroic
efforts to recover data in an appropriately equipped
lab.</p>

<p>Scrub nnsa patterns are reasonable for sanitizing modern
PRML/EPRML encoded disk devices.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of scrubbing regular files through a
file system will be limited by the OS and file system. File
systems that are known to be problematic are journaled, log
structured, copy-on-write, versioned, and network file
systems. If in doubt, scrub the raw disk device.</p>

<p>Scrubbing free blocks in a file system with the -X
method is subject to the same caveats as scrubbing regular
files, and in addition, is only useful to the extent the
file system allows you to reallocate the tar- get blocks as
data blocks in a new file. If in doubt, scrub the raw disk
device.</p>

<p>[MacOS X HFS file system] Scrub attempts to overwrite a
files resource fork if it exists. Although MacOS X will
support additional named forks in the future, scrub is only
aware of the traditional data and resource forks.</p>

<p>STANDARDS The dod scrub sequence is compliant with the
DoD 5220.22-M procedure for sanitizing removeable and
non-removeable rigid disks which requires overwriting all
addressable locations with a character, its complement, then
a random character, and verify. Please refer to the DoD
document for additional constraints.</p>

<p>The nnsa (default) scrub sequence is compliant with a
Dec. 2005 draft of NNSA Policy Letter NAP-14.x (see
reference below) for sanitizing removable and non-removable
hard disks, which requires overwriting all locations with a
pseudorandom pattern twice and then with a known pat- tern.
Please refer to the NNSA document for additional
constraints.</p>

<p>Please consult local authorities regarding your site
policy for disk sanitization.</p>
