<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be

<p>NAME wctrans - define character mapping</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wctype.h&gt;</p>

<p>wctrans_t wctrans(const char *charclass);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wctrans() function is defined for valid
character mapping names identified in the current locale.
The charclass is a string identifying a generic character
mapping name for which codeset-specific information is
required. The following character mapping names are defined
in all locales: tolower and toupper.</p>

<p>The function shall return a value of type wctrans_t,
which can be used as the second argument to subsequent calls
of towctrans(). The wctrans() function shall determine
values of wctrans_t according to the rules of the coded
character set defined by character mapping informa- tion in
the program s locale (category LC_CTYPE ). The values
returned by wctrans() shall be valid until a call to
setlocale() that modifies the category LC_CTYPE.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wctrans() function shall return 0 and
may set errno to indicate the error if the given character
mapping name is not valid for the cur- rent locale (category
LC_CTYPE ); otherwise, it shall return a non-zero object of
type wctrans_t that can be used in calls to towctrans().</p>

<p>ERRORS The wctrans() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The character mapping name pointed to by
charclass is not valid in the current locale.</p>
