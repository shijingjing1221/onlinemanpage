<p>NAME voodoo - Voodoo video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;voodoo&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION voodoo is an Xorg driver for Voodoo 1 and
Voodoo 2 series video adapters. On the Voodoo 1 the driver
uses a shadow buffer in system memory as the video adapter
has only 3D acceleration. Selected portions of the shadow
framebuffer are copied out to the Voodoo board at the right
time. Because of this, the speed of the driver is very
dependent on the CPU. Processors nowadays are actually
rather fast at moving data so we get very good speed anyway
as the shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM.</p>

<p>The Voodoo2 has 16bpp acceleration and the driver
provides accelerated versions of most operations except
angled lines and stipples. Acceler- ated alpha blending with
the Render extension is also supported as is DGA.</p>

<p>This driver supports 16bpp modes currently. The video
hardware supports image conversion from 24bpp to 16bpp but
the hardware is 16bpp only.</p>

<p>The Voodoo 1 series cards can go up to 800x600
resolution while the Voodoo 2 can reach 1024x768 providing
it has at least 2Mb of frame buffer memory. 1024x768 2D mode
does not require two cards configured in scan-line
interleave mode (SLI).</p>

<p>Multihead and Xinerama configurations are supported. SLI
configurations will be treated as multiple video cards.</p>

<p>Limited support for DPMS screen saving is available. The
&quot;standby&quot; and &quot;suspend&quot; modes are just
painting the screen black. The &quot;off&quot; mode turns
the Voodoo board off and thus works correctly.</p>

<p>This driver does not support a virtual screen size
different from the display size. This is a hardware
limitation. 3D rendering is also not supported.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
a shadow buffer in main memory. This turns off accelera-
tion but for otherwise unaccelerated operations can improve
per- formance materially. Default: off for voodoo2, on for
voodoo1.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disables
acceleration if set. Unless debugging this option should
only be set if ShadowFB is enabled. Default: off for
voodoo2, on for voodoo1.</p>

<p>BUGS The driver interacts badly with the sstfb frame
buffer driver as there is insufficient information to
restore the chip to its previous state.</p>
