<p>NAME scale - Create and manipulate scale widgets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scale pathName ?options?</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -activebackground -foreground -relief
-background -highlightbackground -repeatdelay -borderwidth
-highlightcolor -repeatinterval -cursor -highlightthickness
-takefocus -font -orient -troughcolor</p>

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-bigincrement
Database Name: bigIncrement Database Class: BigIncrement</p>

<p>Some interactions with the scale cause its value to
change by large increments; this option specifies the size
of the large increments. If specified as 0, the large
increments default to 1/10 the range of the scale.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-command Database Name: command
Database Class: Command</p>

<p>Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke whenever
the scales value is changed via a widget command. The actual
com- mand consists of this option followed by a space and a
real num- ber indicating the new value of the scale.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-digits Database Name: digits Database
Class: Digits</p>

<p>An integer specifying how many significant digits should
be retained when converting the value of the scale to a
string. If the number is less than or equal to zero, then
the scale picks the smallest value that guarantees that
every possible slider position prints as a different
string.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-from Database Name: from Database
Class: From</p>

<p>A real value corresponding to the left or top end of the
scale.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-label Database Name: label Database
Class: Label</p>

<p>A string to display as a label for the scale. For
vertical scales the label is displayed just to the right of
the top end of the scale. For horizontal scales the label is
displayed just above the left end of the scale. If the
option is specified as an empty string, no label is
displayed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-length Database Name: length Database
Class: Length</p>

<p>Specifies the desired long dimension of the scale in
screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels). For vertical scales this is the scales
height; for horizontal scales it is the scales width.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-resolution Database Name: resolution
Database Class: Resolution</p>

<p>A real value specifying the resolution for the scale. If
this value is greater than zero then the scale s value will
always be rounded to an even multiple of this value, as will
tick marks and the endpoints of the scale. If the value is
less than zero then no rounding occurs. Defaults to 1 (i.e.,
the value will be integral).</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-showvalue Database Name: showValue
Database Class: ShowValue</p>

<p>Specifies a boolean value indicating whether or not the
current value of the scale is to be displayed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-sliderlength Database Name:
sliderLength Database Class: SliderLength</p>

<p>Specifies the size of the slider, measured in screen
units along the sliders long dimension. The value may be
specified in any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-sliderrelief Database Name:
sliderRelief Database Class: SliderRelief</p>

<p>Specifies the relief to use when drawing the slider,
such as raised or sunken.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-state Database Name: state Database
Class: State</p>

<p>Specifies one of three states for the scale: normal,
active, or disabled. If the scale is disabled then the value
may not be changed and the scale will not activate. If the
scale is active, the slider is displayed using the color
specified by the activeBackground option.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-tickinterval Database Name:
tickInterval Database Class: TickInterval</p>

<p>Must be a real value. Determines the spacing between
numerical tick marks displayed below or to the left of the
slider. If 0, no tick marks will be displayed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-to Database Name: to Database Class:
To</p>

<p>Specifies a real value corresponding to the right or
bottom end of the scale. This value may be either less than
or greater than the from option.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-variable Database Name: variable
Database Class: Variable</p>

<p>Specifies the name of a global variable to link to the
scale. Whenever the value of the variable changes, the scale
will update to reflect this value. Whenever the scale is
manipulated interactively, the variable will be modified to
reflect the scales new value.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies the desired narrow dimension of the trough in
screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels). For vertical scales this is the troughs
width; for horizontal scales this is the trough s height.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The scale command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a scale
widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
con- figure aspects of the scale such as its colors,
orientation, and relief. The scale command returns its
pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named pathName, but pathNames
parent must exist.</p>

<p>A scale is a widget that displays a rectangular trough
and a small slider. The trough corresponds to a range of
real values (determined by the from, to, and resolution
options), and the position of the slider selects a
particular real value. The slider s position (and hence the
scales value) may be adjusted with the mouse or keyboard as
described in the BINDINGS section below. Whenever the scales
value is changed, a Tcl command is invoked (using the
command option) to notify other interested widgets of the
change. In addition, the value of the scale can be linked to
a Tcl variable (using the variable option), so that changes
in either are reflected in the other.</p>

<p>Three annotations may be displayed in a scale widget: a
label appear- ing at the top right of the widget (top left
for horizontal scales), a number displayed just to the left
of the slider (just above the slider for horizontal scales),
and a collection of numerical tick marks just to the left of
the current value (just below the trough for horizontal
scales). Each of these three annotations may be enabled or
disabled using the configuration options.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The scale command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
The following commands are possible for scale widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the scale command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
infor- mation on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the scale command.</p>

<p>pathName coords ?value? Returns a list whose elements
are the x and y coordinates of the point along the
centerline of the trough that corresponds to value. If value
is omitted then the scale s current value is used.</p>

<p>pathName get ?x y? If x and y are omitted, returns the
current value of the scale. If x and y are specified, they
give pixel coordinates within the widget; the command
returns the scale value corresponding to the given pixel.
Only one of x or y is used: for horizontal scales y is
ignored, and for vertical scales x is ignored.</p>

<p>pathName identify x y Returns a string indicating what
part of the scale lies under the coordinates given by x and
y. A return value of slider means that the point is over the
slider; trough1 means that the point is over the portion of
the slider above or to the left of the slider; and trough2
means that the point is over the portion of the slider below
or to the right of the slider. If the point is not over one
of these elements, an empty string is returned.</p>

<p>pathName set value This command is invoked to change the
current value of the scale, and hence the position at which
the slider is displayed. Value gives the new value for the
scale. The command has no effect if the scale is
disabled.</p>

<p>BINDINGS Tk automatically creates class bindings for
scales that give them the following default behavior. Where
the behavior is different for verti- cal and horizontal
scales, the horizontal behavior is described in
parentheses.</p>

<p>[1] If button 1 is pressed in the trough, the scales
value will be incremented or decremented by the value of the
resolution option so that the slider moves in the direction
of the cursor. If the button is held down, the action
auto-repeats.</p>

<p>[2] If button 1 is pressed over the slider, the slider
can be dragged with the mouse.</p>

<p>[3] If button 1 is pressed in the trough with the
Control key down, the slider moves all the way to the end of
its range, in the direction towards the mouse cursor.</p>

<p>[4] If button 2 is pressed, the scales value is set to
the mouse position. If the mouse is dragged with button 2
down, the scales value changes with the drag.</p>

<p>[5] The Up and Left keys move the slider up (left) by
the value of the resolution option.</p>

<p>[6] The Down and Right keys move the slider down (right)
by the value of the resolution option.</p>

<p>[7] Control-Up and Control-Left move the slider up
(left) by the value of the bigIncrement option.</p>

<p>[8] Control-Down and Control-Right move the slider down
(right) by the value of the bigIncrement option.</p>

<p>[9] Home moves the slider to the top (left) end of its
range.</p>

<p>[10] End moves the slider to the bottom (right) end of
its range.</p>

<p>If the scale is disabled using the state option then
none of the above bindings have any effect.</p>

<p>The behavior of scales can be changed by defining new
bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the class
bindings.</p>
