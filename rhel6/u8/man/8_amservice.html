<p>NAME amservice - run an amanda service on a client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amservice hostname auth service [-f input_file]
[-o configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amservice execute an Amanda service on a
client. It can be used without amanda server configuration
(amanda.conf and disklist). It can be used to check
communication between a server and a client. Amservice reads
stdin to capture the REQ packet to send to the client.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS hostname The hostname of the client.</p>

<p>auth The auth to use, one of: bsd, bsdudp, bsdtcp, ssh,
rsh or krb5. The client must be configured with this
auth.</p>

<p>service The amanda service to execute on the client. One
of noop, selfcheck or sendsize.</p>

<p>-f input_file Use the file input_file instead of stdin
to read the REQ packet from.</p>

<p>-o configoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The noop service is easy to execute because it
does not require a REQ packet: amservice hostname bsdtcp
noop &lt; /dev/null.fi</p>

<p>The example executes the noop service on the client
using bsdtcp auth. This is useful for debugging connection
problems. It print an OPTIONS line upon success.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to execute the selfcheck or
sendsize service, as these require a valid REQ packet. If
you have already uccessfully run amanda, you can find valid
REQ packets in the amandad.*.debug files.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The exit code of amservice is one of: 0 =
success 1 = error executing amandad on the client.</p>

<p>As amservice doesn&acute;t parse the REP packet, it can
only detect failures in executing amandad on the client.
amservice can exit with value 0 even if the user is not
authorized to execute the service. An error message will be
printed.</p>
