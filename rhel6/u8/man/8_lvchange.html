<p>DESCRIPTION lvchange allows you to change the attributes
of a logical volume including making them known to the
kernel ready for use.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-a|--activate [a][e|s|l]{y|n} Controls the availability
of the logical volumes for use. Com- municates with the
kernel device-mapper driver via libdevmapper to activate
(-ay) or deactivate (-an) the logical volumes. Activation of
a logical volume creates a symbolic link /dev/Vol-
umeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName pointing to the device node.
This link is removed on deactivation. All software and
scripts should access the device through this symbolic link
and present this as the name of the device. The location and
name of the underlying device node may depend on the
distribution and con- figuration (e.g. udev) and might
change from release to release. If autoactivation option is
used (-aay), the logical volume is activated only if it
matches an item in the activa-
tion/auto_activation_volume_list set in lvm.conf(5). If this
list is not set, then all volumes are considered for
activation. The -aay option should be also used during
system boot so its possible to select which volumes to
activate using the activa- tion/auto_activation_volume_list
setting. In a clustered VG, clvmd is used for activation,
and the follow- ing options are possible:</p>

<p>With -aey, clvmd activates the LV in exclusive mode
(with an exclusive lock), allowing a single node to activate
the LV.</p>

<p>With -asy, clvmd activates the LV in shared mode (with a
shared lock), allowing multiple nodes to activate the LV
concurrently. If the LV type prohibits shared access, such
as an LV with a snapshot, the s option is ignored and an
exclusive lock is used.</p>

<p>With -ay (no mode specified), clvmd activates the LV in
shared mode if the LV type allows concurrent access, such as
a linear LV. Otherwise, clvmd activates the LV in exclusive
mode.</p>

<p>With -aey, -asy, and -ay, clvmd attempts to activate the
LV on all nodes. If exclusive mode is used, then only one of
the nodes will be successful.</p>

<p>With -an, clvmd attempts to deactivate the LV on all
nodes.</p>

<p>With -aly, clvmd activates the LV only on the local
node, and -aln deactivates only on the local node. If the LV
type allows concurrent access, then shared mode is used,
otherwise exclu- sive.</p>

<p>LVs with snapshots are always activated exclusively
because they can only be used on one node at once.</p>

<p>For local VGs -ay, -aey, and -asy are all
equivalent.</p>

<p>--activationmode {complete|degraded|partial} The
activation mode determines whether logical volumes are
allowed to activate when there are physical volumes missing
(e.g. due to a device failure). complete is the most
restric- tive; allowing only those logical volumes to be
activated that are not affected by the missing PVs. degraded
allows RAID logi- cal volumes to be activated even if they
have PVs missing. (Note that the &quot;mirror&quot; segment
type is not considered a RAID logical volume. The
&quot;raid1&quot; segment type should be used instead.)
Finally, partial allows any logical volume to be activated
even if portions are missing due to a missing or failed PV.
This last option should only be used when performing
recovery or repair operations. degraded is the default mode.
To change it, modify activation_mode in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>-K|--ignoreactivationskip Ignore the flag to skip
Logical Volumes during activation.</p>

<p>-k|--setactivationskip {y|n} Controls whether Logical
Volumes are persistently flagged to be skipped during
activation. By default, thin snapshot volumes are flagged
for activation skip. To activate such volumes, an extra
--ignoreactivationskip option must be used. The flag is not
applied during deactivation. To see whether the flag is
attached, use lvs(8) command where the state of the flag is
reported within lv_attr bits.</p>

<p>--cachepolicy policy, --cachesettings key=value Only
applicable to cached LVs; see also lvmcache(7). Sets the
cache policy and its associated tunable settings. In most
use- cases, default values should be adequate.</p>

<p>-C|--contiguous {y|n} Tries to set or reset the
contiguous allocation policy for logi- cal volumes. It s
only possible to change a non-contiguous logi- cal volume s
allocation policy to contiguous, if all of the allocated
physical extents are already contiguous.</p>

<p>--detachprofile Detach any metadata configuration
profiles attached to given Logical Volumes. See lvm.conf(5)
for more information about metadata profiles.</p>

<p>--discards {ignore|nopassdown|passdown} Set this to
ignore to ignore any discards received by a thin pool
Logical Volume. Set to nopassdown to process such discards
within the thin pool itself and allow the no-longer-needed
extents to be overwritten by new data. Set to passdown (the
default) to process them both within the thin pool itself
and to pass them down the underlying device.</p>

<p>--errorwhenfull {y|n} Sets thin pool behavior when data
space is exhaused. See lvcre- ate(8) for information.</p>

<p>--ignoremonitoring Make no attempt to interact with
dmeventd unless --monitor is specified. Do not use this if
dmeventd is already monitoring a device.</p>

<p>--major major Sets the major number. This option is
supported only on older systems (kernel version 2.4) and is
ignored on modern Linux sys- tems where major numbers are
dynamically assigned.</p>

<p>--minor minor Set the minor number.</p>

<p>--metadataprofile ProfileName Uses and attaches
ProfileName configuration profile to the logi- cal volume
metadata. Whenever the logical volume is processed next
time, the profile is automatically applied. If the volume
group has another profile attached, the logical volume
profile is preferred. See lvm.conf(5) for more information
about meta- data profiles.</p>

<p>--monitor {y|n} Start or stop monitoring a mirrored or
snapshot logical volume with dmeventd, if it is installed.
If a device used by a moni- tored mirror reports an I/O
error, the failure is handled according to
mirror_image_fault_policy and mirror_log_fault_pol- icy set
in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>-p|--permission {r|rw} Change access permission to
read-only or read/write.</p>

<p>-M|--persistent {y|n} Set to y to make the minor number
specified persistent. Change of persistent numbers is not
supported for pool volumes.</p>

<p>--poll {y|n} Without polling a logical volume s
backgrounded transformation process will never complete. If
there is an incomplete pvmove or lvconvert (for example, on
rebooting after a crash), use --poll y to restart the
process from its last checkpoint. How- ever, it may not be
appropriate to immediately poll a logical volume when it is
activated, use --poll n to defer and then --poll y to
restart the process.</p>

<p>--[raid]maxrecoveryrate Rate[b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G] Sets
the maximum recovery rate for a RAID logical volume. Rate is
specified as an amount per second for each device in the
array. If no suffix is given, then KiB/sec/device is
assumed. Setting the recovery rate to 0 means it will be
unbounded.</p>

<p>--[raid]minrecoveryrate Rate[b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G] Sets
the minimum recovery rate for a RAID logical volume. Rate is
specified as an amount per second for each device in the
array. If no suffix is given, then KiB/sec/device is
assumed. Setting the recovery rate to 0 means it will be
unbounded.</p>

<p>--[raid]syncaction {check|repair} This argument is used
to initiate various RAID synchronization operations. The
check and repair options provide a way to check the
integrity of a RAID logical volume (often referred to as
&quot;scrubbing&quot;). These options cause the RAID logical
volume to read all of the data and parity blocks in the
array and check for any discrepancies (e.g. mismatches
between mirrors or incor- rect parity values). If check is
used, the discrepancies will be counted but not repaired. If
repair is used, the discrepan- cies will be corrected as
they are encountered. The lvs(8) com- mand can be used to
show the number of discrepancies found or repaired.</p>

<p>--[raid]writebehind IOCount Specify the maximum number
of outstanding writes that are allowed to devices in a RAID1
logical volume that are marked as write-mostly. Once this
value is exceeded, writes become syn- chronous (i.e. all
writes to the constituent devices must com- plete before the
array signals the write has completed). Set- ting the value
to zero clears the preference and allows the sys- tem to
choose the value arbitrarily.</p>

<p>--[raid]writemostly PhysicalVolume[:{y|n|t}] Mark a
device in a RAID1 logical volume as write-mostly. All reads
to these drives will be avoided unless absolutely neces-
sary. This keeps the number of I/Os to the drive to a
minimum. The default behavior is to set the write-mostly
attribute for the specified physical volume in the logical
volume. It is pos- sible to also remove the write-mostly
flag by appending a &quot;:n&quot; to the physical volume or
to toggle the value by specifying &quot;:t&quot;. The
--writemostly argument can be specified more than one time
in a single command; making it possible to toggle the
write-mostly attributes for all the physical volumes in a
logi- cal volume at once.</p>

<p>-r|--readahead {ReadAheadSectors|auto|none} Set read
ahead sector count of this logical volume. For volume groups
with metadata in lvm1 format, this must be a value between 2
and 120 sectors. The default value is &quot;auto&quot; which
allows the kernel to choose a suitable value automatically.
&quot;none&quot; is equivalent to specifying zero.</p>

<p>--refresh If the logical volume is active, reload its
metadata. This is not necessary in normal operation, but may
be useful if some- thing has gone wrong or if you re doing
clustering manually without a clustered lock manager.</p>

<p>--resync Forces the complete resynchronization of a
mirror. In normal circumstances you should not need this
option because synchro- nization happens automatically. Data
is read from the primary mirror device and copied to the
others, so this can take a con- siderable amount of time -
and during this time you are without a complete redundant
copy of your data.</p>

<p>--sysinit Indicates that lvchange(8) is being invoked
from early system initialisation scripts (e.g. rc.sysinit or
an initrd), before writeable filesystems are available. As
such, some functionality needs to be disabled and this
option acts as a shortcut which selects an appropriate set
of options. Currently this is equiva- lent to using
--ignorelockingfailure, --ignoremonitoring, --poll n and
setting LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES environment
variable.</p>

<p>If --sysinit is used in conjunction with lvmetad(8)
enabled and running, autoactivation is preferred over manual
activation via direct lvchange call. Logical volumes are
autoactivated accord- ing to auto_activation_volume_list set
in lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>-Z|--zero {y|n} Set zeroing mode for thin pool. Note:
already provisioned blocks from pool in non-zero mode are
not cleared in unwritten parts when setting zero to y.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES Suppress locking
failure messages.</p>

<p>Examples Changes the permission on volume lvol1 in
volume group vg00 to be read- only:</p>

<p>lvchange -pr vg00/lvol1</p>
