<p>NAME ipa-csreplica-manage - Manage an IPA CS replica</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-csreplica-manage [OPTION]...
[connect|disconnect|del|list|re-ini- tialize|force-sync]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Manages the CA replication agreements of an
IPA server.</p>

<p>connect [SERVER_A] &lt;SERVER_B&gt; - Adds a new
replication agreement between SERVER_A/localhost and
SERVER_B</p>

<p>disconnect [SERVER_A] &lt;SERVER_B&gt; - Removes a
replication agreement between SERVER_A/localhost and
SERVER_B</p>

<p>del &lt;SERVER&gt; - Removes all replication agreements
and data about SERVER</p>

<p>list [SERVER] - Lists all the servers or the list of
agreements of SERVER</p>

<p>re-initialize - Forces a full re-initialization of the
IPA CA server retriev- ing data from the server specified
with the --from option</p>

<p>force-sync - Immediately flush any data to be replicated
from a server specified with the --from option</p>

<p>The connect and disconnect options are used to manage
the replication topology. When a replica is created it is
only connected with the mas- ter that created it. The
connect option may be used to connect it to other existing
replicas.</p>

<p>The disconnect option cannot be used to remove the last
link of a replica. To remove a replica from the topology use
the del option.</p>

<p>If a replica is deleted and then re-added within a short
time-frame then the 389-ds instance on the master that
created it should be restarted before re-installing the
replica. The master will have the old service principals
cached which will cause replication to fail.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -H HOST, --host=HOST The IPA server to manage.
The default is the machine on which the command is run Not
honoured by the re-initialize command.</p>

<p>-p DM_PASSWORD, --password=DM_PASSWORD The Directory
Manager password to use for authentication</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Provide additional information</p>

<p>-f, --force Ignore some types of errors</p>

<p>--from=SERVER The server to pull the data from, used by
the re-initialize and force-sync commands.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES List a servers replication agreements. #
ipa-csreplica-manage list srv1.example.com srv2.example.com
srv3.example.com</p>

<p>Re-initialize a replica: # ipa-csreplica-manage
re-initialize --from srv2.example.com</p>

<p>This will re-initialize the data on the server where you
execute the command, retrieving the data from the
srv2.example.com replica</p>

<p>Add a new replication agreement: # ipa-csreplica-manage
connect srv2.example.com srv4.exam- ple.com</p>

<p>Remove an existing replication agreement: #
ipa-csreplica-manage disconnect srv1.example.com srv3.exam-
ple.com</p>

<p>Completely remove a replica: # ipa-csreplica-manage del
srv4.example.com</p>

<p>Using connect/disconnect you can manage the replication
topology.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the command was successful</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>
