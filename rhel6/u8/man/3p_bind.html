<p>BIND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual BIND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME bind - bind a name to a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address,
socklen_t address_len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The bind() function shall assign a local
socket address address to a socket identified by descriptor
socket that has no local socket address assigned. Sockets
created with the socket() function are initially unnamed;
they are identified only by their address family.</p>

<p>The bind() function takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>socket Specifies the file descriptor of the socket to be
bound.</p>

<p>address Points to a sockaddr structure containing the
address to be bound to the socket. The length and format of
the address depend on the address family of the socket.</p>

<p>address_len Specifies the length of the sockaddr
structure pointed to by the address argument.</p>

<p>The socket specified by socket may require the process
to have appro- priate privileges to use the bind()
function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, bind() shall
return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The bind() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EADDRINUSE The specified address is already in use.</p>

<p>EADDRNOTAVAIL The specified address is not available
from the local machine.</p>

<p>EAFNOSUPPORT The specified address is not a valid
address for the address family of the specified socket.</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The socket is already bound to an address, and
the protocol does not support binding to a new address; or
the socket has been shut down.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The socket type of the specified socket does
not support binding to an address.</p>

<p>If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
bind() shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES A component of the path prefix denies search
permission, or the requested name requires writing in a
directory with a mode that denies write permission.</p>

<p>EDESTADDRREQ or EISDIR The address argument is a null
pointer.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the pathname in address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG A component of a pathname exceeded
{NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire pathname exceeded
{PATH_MAX} characters.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of the pathname does not name an
existing file or the pathname is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix of the pathname
in address is not a directory.</p>

<p>EROFS The name would reside on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>The bind() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The specified address is protected and the
current user does not have permission to bind to it.</p>

<p>EINVAL The address_len argument is not a valid length
for the address family.</p>

<p>EISCONN The socket is already connected.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the pathname in
address.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available to
complete the call.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE An application program can retrieve
the assigned socket name with the getsockname()
function.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
