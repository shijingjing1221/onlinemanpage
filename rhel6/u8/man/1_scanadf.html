<p>NAME scanadf - acquire multiple images from a scanner
equipped with an ADF</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scanadf [-d|--device-name dev] [-h|--help]
[-L|--list-devices] [-v|--verbose] [-V|--version]
[-o|--output-file name] [-N|--no-over- write]
[-S|--scan-script name] [--script-wait] [-s|--start-count
num] [-e|--end-count num] [-r|--raw]
[device-specific-options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION scanadf is a command-line interface to
control image acquisition devices which are capable of
returning a series of images (e.g. a scan- ner with an
automatic document feeder (ADF)). The device is controlled
via command-line options. After command-line processing,
scanadf nor- mally proceeds to acquire a series of images
until the device returns the SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS status
code.</p>

<p>The images are written to output files, specified by the
--output-file option. These files are typically written in
one of the PNM (portable aNyMaP) formats (PBM for
black-and-white images, PGM for grayscale images, and PPM
for color images). Several optional frame formats
(SANE_FRAME_JPEG, SANE_FRAME_G31D, SANE_FRAME_G32D,
SANE_FRAME_G42D, and SANE_FRAME_TEXT) are supported. In each
case, the data is written out to the output file as-is
without a header. Unrecognized frame for- mats are handled
in the same way, although a warning message is printed in
verbose mode.</p>

<p>Typically, the optional frame formats are used in
conjunction with a scan script (specified by the
--scanscript option) which is invoked for each acquired
image. The script is provided with a series of environ- ment
variables which describe the parameters and format of the
image file.</p>

<p>scanadf accesses image acquisition devices through the
SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) interface and can thus
support any device for which there exists a SANE backend
(try &quot;apropos sane-&quot; to get a list of available
backends).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The -d or --device-name options must be followed
by a SANE device-name. A (partial) list of available devices
can be obtained with the --list- devices option (see below).
If no device-name is specified explicitly, scanadf will
attempt to open the first available device.</p>

<p>The -h or --help options request help information. The
information is printed on standard output and in this case,
no attempt will be made to acquire an image.</p>

<p>The -L or --list-devices option requests a (partial)
list of devices that are available. The list is not complete
since some devices may be available, but are not listed in
any of the configuration files (which are typically stored
in directory /etc/sane.d). This is particularly the case
when accessing scanners through the network. If a device is
not listed in a configuration file, the only way to access
it is by its full device name. You may need to consult your
system administrator to find out the names of such
devices.</p>

<p>The -v or --verbose options increase the verbosity of
the operation of scanadf. The option may be specified
repeatedly, each time increasing the verbosity level.</p>

<p>The -V or --version option requests that scanadf print
the program and package name, as well as the version number
of the SANE distribution that it came with.</p>

<p>The -o or --output-file option specifies a format string
used to gener- ate the name of file to write the image data
to. You can use %d replacement in the output file name; this
will be replaced with the current page number. The default
format string is image-%04d.</p>

<p>The -N or --no-overwrite option prevents scanadf from
overwriting existing image files.</p>

<p>The -S or --scan-script option specifies the name of
script to run after each scanned image is acquired. The
script receives the name of the image output file as its
first and only command line argument. Additionally the scan
script can reference the following environment variables to
get information about the parameters of the image.</p>

<p>SCAN_RES - the image resolution (in DPI) SCAN_WIDTH -
the image width (in pixels) SCAN_HEIGHT - the image height
(in pixels) SCAN_DEPTH - the image bit-depth (in bits)
SCAN_FORMAT - a string representing the image format (e.g.
gray, g42d, text, etc) SCAN_FORMAT_ID - the numeric image
format identifier</p>

<p>If the --scipt-wait option is given, scanadf will wait
until all scan- scripts have been finished before exiting.
That will be useful if scanadf is used in conjunction with
tools to modify the scanned images.</p>

<p>The -s or --start-count option specifies the page number
of first scanned image.</p>

<p>The -e or --end-count option specifies the last page
number to scan. Using this option, you can request a
specific number of pages to be scanned, rather than scanning
until there are no more images available.</p>

<p>The -r or --raw option specifies that the raw image data
be written to the output file as-is without interpretation.
This disables the writ- ing of the PNM header for basic
frame types. This feature is usually used in conjunction
with the --scan-script option where the scan script uses the
environment variables to understand the format and
parameters of the image and converts the file to a more
useful format. NOTE: With support for the optional frame
types and the default handling of unrec- ognized frametypes,
this option becomes less and less useful.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, much of the power of scanadf comes
from the fact that it can control any SANE backend. Thus,
the exact set of command- line options depends on the
capabilities of the selected device. To see the options for
a device named dev, invoke scanadf via a command- line of
the form:</p>

<p>scanadf --help --device dev</p>

<p>The documentation for the device-specific options
printed by --help is explained in the manual page for
scanimage.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d This directory holds various
configuration files. For details, please refer to the manual
pages listed below.</p>

<p>AUTHOR scanadf is an adaptation by Tom Martone of
scanimage by David Mos- berger, Andreas Beck, and Gordon
Matzigkeit following closely the fea- tures of bnhscan by
Sean Reifschneider of tummy.com, ltd.</p>

<p>BUGS Please send reports to
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.</p>

<p>This program relies on the backend to return the
SANE_STATUS_NO_DOCS status code when the automatic document
feeder is out of paper. Use of this program with backends
that do not support ADFs (e.g. flatbed scan- ners) will
likely result in repeated scans of the same document. In
this case, it is essential to use the start-count and
end-count to con- trol the number of images acquired.</p>

<p>Only a subset of the SANE backends support feeders and
return SANE_STA- TUS_NO_DOCS appropriately. Backends which
are known to work at this time are:</p>

<p>sane-bh - Bell+Howell Copiscan II series scanners.
sane-hp - Hewlett Packard scanners. A patch to the sane-hp
backend is necessary. The --scantype=ADF option must be
speci- fied (earlier versions of the backend used the
--scan-from-adf option, instead). sane-umax - UMAX scanners.
Support exists in build 12 and later. The
--source=&quot;Automatic Document Feeder&quot; option must
be specified.</p>
