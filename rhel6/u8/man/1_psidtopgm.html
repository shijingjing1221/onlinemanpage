<p>NAME psidtopgm - convert PostScript image data to a PGM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS psidtopgm width height bits/sample
[imagedata]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>psidtopgm reads the image data from a PostScript file as
input and produces a PGM image as output.</p>

<p>This program is obsoleted by pstopnm.</p>

<p>What follows was written before pstopnm existed.</p>

<p>This is a very simple and limited program, and is here
only because so many people have asked for it. To use it you
have to manually extract the readhexstring data portion from
your PostScript file, and then give the width, height, and
bits/sample on the command line. Before you attempt this,
you should at least read the description of the image
operator in the PostScript Language Reference Manual.</p>

<p>It would probably not be too hard to write a script that
uses this fil- ter to read a specific variety of PostScript
image, but the variation is too great to make a
general-purpose reader. Unless, of course, you want to write
a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...</p>
