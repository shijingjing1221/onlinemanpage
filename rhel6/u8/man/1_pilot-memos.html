<p>NAME pilot-memos - Manipulate Memo entries from a file
or your Palm device.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Userland conduits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-memos [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[-q|--quiet] [--version] [-?|--help] [--usage]
[-v|--verbose] [-d|--delete] [-f|--file file] [-s|--save
dir] [-c|--category STRING] [-r|--regex STRING]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION By default, the contents of your Palms memo
database will be written to standard output as a standard
UNIX mailbox (mbox-format) file, with each memo as a
separate message. The subject of each message will be the
category.</p>

<p>If -s is specified, then instead of being written to
standard output, memos will be saved in subdirectories of
dir. Each subdirectory will be the name of a category on the
Palm, and will contain the memos in that category. Each
filename will be the first line (up to the first 40
characters) of the memo. Control characters, slashes, and
equal signs that would otherwise appear in filenames are
converted after the fash- ion of MIMEs quoted-printable
encoding. Note that if you have two memos in the same
category whose first lines are identical, one of them will
be overwritten.</p>

<p>If -f is specified, the specified file will be treated
as a memo database from which to read memos, rather than
HotSyncing from the Palm.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-memos options -V, --verbose</p>

<p>Verbose, with -s, print each filename when written to
disk.</p>
