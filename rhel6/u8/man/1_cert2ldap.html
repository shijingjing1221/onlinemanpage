<p>DESCRIPTION Cert2ldap is used to import a certificate
into an LDAP directory in such a as to allow the
mod_authz_ldap Apache module to authenticate and authorize
users based on their certificates. The certificate is either
specified as a certificatefilename argument on the command
line or read from standard input. There are essentially two
ways to use the pro- gram: either a certificate is added as
a userCertifcate attribute to a users node, or a certificate
mapping node is added somewhere else in the directory,
referencing the user.</p>

<p>The second form is active as soon as one if the options
-i, -s, -o or -n are used. The first form uses only the -c
option. The correct con- figuration of the entires can be
checked using the certfind(1) program.</p>

<p>If the node to be updated does not exist yet, a minimal
node is cre- ated. However this is only marginally useful in
the case of a node containing the certificate proper.</p>
