<p>NAME pambayer - interpret Bayer patterns</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pambayer -type={1|2|3|4} [-nointerpolate]
[pamfile]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pambayer reads a Bayer pattern in a 1-deep Netpbm image
and produces a color image in PAM RGB format as output.</p>

<p>A Bayer pattern is what you get from the optical sensor
in some digital cameras. Such a camera doesnt have a red,
green, and blue sensor in the exact same place for an
individual pixel. Instead, it has red, green, and blue
sensors laid out in a two dimensional array. The pat- tern
in which they are laid out is the Bayer pattern. The input
to pambayer is one sample value for each of those sensors,
so some samples are red, some are green, and some are
blue.</p>

<p>pambayer turns that into a regular visual image with one
pixel per sen- sor. For the two components of each pixel
that are missing in the cor- responding Bayer input,
pambayer averages the sample values from the adjacent pixels
that do have that component.</p>

<p>But you can have pambayer fill in black instead (see the
-noninterpo- late option), which gives you a simpler
representation of what the cam- era saw, on which you might
do further processing. Such an image still looks right,
though considerably dimmer, if you stand far enough away and
let your eyes do the interpolation.</p>

<p>The input image is a pseudo-PNM image (pseudo- because
while the struc- ture is the same, the sample values have
different meanings) or PAM image of arbitrary tuple type.
pambayer looks at only the first plane of the input.</p>

<p>The output image is a PAM image of tuple type RGB, i.e.
a standard color image. You can convert this to PPM with
pamtopnm(1).</p>

<p>If youre interested in just one of the primary colors,
use pamchannel on the output of pambayer to extract it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -type=n This tells which Bayer pattern the input
is:</p>

<p>1 GBG/RGR/GBG matrix</p>

<p>2 RGR/GBG/RGR matrix</p>

<p>3 BGB/GRG/BGB matrix</p>

<p>4 GRG/BGB/GRG matrix</p>

<p>This option is mandatory.</p>

<p>-nointerpolate Each output pixel position corresponds to
one position in the input Bayer pattern, which means only
one of the three color components is supplied by the input.
For the other two, this option says to user zero. Without
it, pambayer instead interpo- lates from the adjacent pixels
that do have that color compo- nent.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009).</p>
