<p>CHOWN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CHOWN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME chown - change owner and group of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int chown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t
group);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The chown() function shall change the user
and group ownership of a file.</p>

<p>The path argument points to a pathname naming a file.
The user ID and group ID of the named file shall be set to
the numeric values contained in owner and group,
respectively.</p>

<p>Only processes with an effective user ID equal to the
user ID of the file or with appropriate privileges may
change the ownership of a file. If _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
is in effect for path:</p>

<p>* Changing the user ID is restricted to processes with
appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>* Changing the group ID is permitted to a process with
an effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file, but
without appropriate privileges, if and only if owner is
equal to the files user ID or ( uid_t)-1 and group is equal
either to the calling process effective group ID or to one
of its supplementary group IDs.</p>

<p>If the specified file is a regular file, one or more of
the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are
set, and the process does not have appropriate privileges,
the set-user-ID (S_ISUID) and set- group-ID (S_ISGID) bits
of the file mode shall be cleared upon success- ful return
from chown(). If the specified file is a regular file, one
or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file
mode are set, and the process has appropriate privileges, it
is implementation- defined whether the set-user-ID and
set-group-ID bits are altered. If the chown() function is
successfully invoked on a file that is not a regular file
and one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of
the file mode are set, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits
may be cleared.</p>

<p>If owner or group is specified as ( uid_t)-1 or (
gid_t)-1, respec- tively, the corresponding ID of the file
shall not be changed. If both owner and group are -1, the
times need not be updated.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, chown() shall mark for
update the st_ctime field of the file.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no changes are made
in the user ID and group ID of the file.</p>

<p>ERRORS The chown() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>EPERM The effective user ID does not match the owner of
the file, or the calling process does not have appropriate
privileges and _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED indicates that such
privilege is required.</p>

<p>EROFS The named file resides on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>The chown() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading or writing to
the file sys- tem.</p>

<p>EINTR The chown() function was interrupted by a signal
which was caught.</p>

<p>EINVAL The owner or group ID supplied is not a value
supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Although chown() can be used on some
implementations by the file owner to change the owner and
group to any desired values, the only portable use of this
function is to change the group of a file to the effective
GID of the calling process or to a member of its group
set.</p>

<p>RATIONALE System III and System V allow a user to give
away files; that is, the owner of a file may change its user
ID to anything. This is a serious problem for
implementations that are intended to meet government secu-
rity regulations. Version 7 and 4.3 BSD permit only the
superuser to change the user ID of a file. Some government
agencies (usually not ones concerned directly with security)
find this limitation too confin- ing. This volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 uses may to permit secure implementations
while not disallowing System V.</p>

<p>System III and System V allow the owner of a file to
change the group ID to anything. Version 7 permits only the
superuser to change the group ID of a file. 4.3 BSD permits
the owner to change the group ID of a file to its effective
group ID or to any of the groups in the list of
supplementary group IDs, but to no others.</p>

<p>The POSIX.1-1990 standard requires that the chown()
function invoked by a non-appropriate privileged process
clear the S_ISGID and the S_ISUID bits for regular files,
and permits them to be cleared for other types of files.
This is so that changes in accessibility do not accidentally
cause files to become security holes. Unfortunately,
requiring these bits to be cleared on non-executable data
files also clears the manda- tory file locking bit (shared
with S_ISGID), which is an extension on many implementations
(it first appeared in System V). These bits should only be
required to be cleared on regular files that have one or
more of their execute bits set.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
