<p>AUDITD.CONF:(5) System Administration Utilities
AUDITD.CONF:(5)</p>

<p>NAME auditd.conf - audit daemon configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/audit/auditd.conf contains
configuration information spe- cific to the audit daemon.
Each line should contain one configuration keyword, an equal
sign, and then followed by appropriate configuration
information. All option names and values are case
insensitive. The key- words recognized are listed and
described below. Each line should be limited to 160
characters or the line will be skipped. You may add com-
ments to the file by starting the line with a #
character.</p>

<p>log_file This keyword specifies the full path name to
the log file where audit records will be stored. It must be
a regular file.</p>

<p>log_format The log format describes how the information
should be stored on disk. There are 2 options: raw and
nolog. If set to RAW, the audit records will be stored in a
format exactly as the kernel sends it. If this option is set
to NOLOG then all audit informa- tion is discarded instead
of writing to disk. This mode does not affect data sent to
the audit event dispatcher.</p>

<p>log_group This keyword specifies the group that is
applied to the log file s permissions. The default is root.
The group name can be either numeric or spelled out.</p>

<p>priority_boost This is a non-negative number that tells
the audit daemon how much of a priority boost it should
take. The default is 4. No change is 0.</p>

<p>flush Valid values are none, incremental, data, and
sync. If set to none, no special effort is made to flush the
audit records to disk. If set to incremental, Then the freq
parameter is used to determine how often an explicit flush
to disk is issued. The data parameter tells the audit daemon
to keep the data portion of the disk file sync d at all
times. The sync option tells the audit daemon to keep both
the data and meta-data fully syncd with every write to
disk.</p>

<p>freq This is a non-negative number that tells the audit
daemon how many records to write before issuing an explicit
flush to disk command. This value is only valid when the
flush keyword is set to incremental.</p>

<p>num_logs This keyword specifies the number of log files
to keep if rotate is given as the max_log_file_action. If
the number is &lt; 2, logs are not rotated. This number must
be 99 or less. The default is 0 - which means no rotation.
As you increase the number of log files being rotated, you
may need to adjust the kernel backlog setting upwards since
it takes more time to rotate the files. This is typically
done in /etc/audit/audit.rules. If log rota- tion is
configured to occur, the daemon will check for excess logs
and remove them in effort to keep disk space available. The
excess log check is only done on startup and when a
reconfigure results in a space check.</p>

<p>disp_qos This option controls whether you want
blocking/lossless or non- blocking/lossy communication
between the audit daemon and the dispatcher. There is a 128k
buffer between the audit daemon and dispatcher. This is good
enogh for most uses. If lossy is cho- sen, incoming events
going to the dispatcher are discarded when this queue is
full. (Events are still written to disk if log_format is not
nolog.) Otherwise the auditd daemon will wait for the queue
to have an empty spot before logging to disk. The risk is
that while the daemon is waiting for network IO, an event is
not being recorded to disk. Valid values are: lossy and
lossless. Lossy is the default value.</p>

<p>dispatcher The dispatcher is a program that is started
by the audit daemon when it starts up. It will pass a copy
of all audit events to that applications stdin. Make sure
you trust the application that you add to this line since it
runs with root privileges.</p>

<p>name_format This option controls how computer node names
are inserted into the audit event stream. It has the
following choices: none, hostname, fqd, numeric, and user.
None means that no computer name is inserted into the audit
event. hostname is the name returned by the gethostname
syscall. The fqd means that it takes the hostname and
resolves it with dns for a fully qualified domain name of
that machine. Numeric is similar to fqd except it resolves
the IP address of the machine. In order to use this option,
you might want to test that hostname -i or domainname -i
returns a numeric address. Also, this option is not recom-
mended if dhcp is used because you could have different
addresses over time for the same machine. User is an admin
defined string from the name option. The default value is
none.</p>

<p>name This is the admin defined string that identifies
the machine if user is given as the name_format option.</p>

<p>max_log_file This keyword specifies the maximum file
size in megabytes. When this limit is reached, it will
trigger a configurable action. The value given must be
numeric.</p>

<p>max_log_file_action This parameter tells the system what
action to take when the system has detected that the max
file size limit has been reached. Valid values are ignore,
syslog, suspend, rotate and keep_logs. If set to ignore, the
audit daemon does nothing. syslog means that it will issue a
warning to syslog. suspend will cause the audit daemon to
stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be
alive. The rotate option will cause the audit daemon to
rotate the logs. It should be noted that logs with higher
numbers are older than logs with lower numbers. This is the
same convention used by the logrotate utility. The keep_logs
option is similar to rotate except it does not use the
num_logs setting. This prevents audit logs from being
overwrit- ten. The effect is that logs accumulate and are
not deleted - which will trigger the space_left_action if
the volume fills up. This is best used in combination with
an external script used to archive logs on a periodic
basis.</p>

<p>action_mail_acct This option should contain a valid
email address or alias. The default address is root. If the
email address is not local to the machine, you must make
sure you have email properly config- ured on your machine
and network. Also, this option requires that
/usr/lib/sendmail exists on the machine.</p>

<p>space_left This is a numeric value in megabytes that
tells the audit daemon when to perform a configurable action
because the system is starting to run low on disk space.</p>

<p>space_left_action This parameter tells the system what
action to take when the system has detected that it is
starting to get low on disk space. Valid values are ignore,
syslog, rotate, email, exec, suspend, single, and halt. If
set to ignore, the audit daemon does nothing. syslog means
that it will issue a warning to sys- log. rotate will rotate
logs, losing the oldest to free up space. Email means that
it will send a warning to the email account specified in
action_mail_acct as well as sending the message to syslog.
exec /path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot
pass parameters to the script. The script is also
responsible for telling the auditd daemon to resume logging
once its completed its action. This can be done by adding
ser- vice auditd resume to the script. suspend will cause
the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The
daemon will still be alive. The single option will cause the
audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.
The halt option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the
computer system.</p>

<p>admin_space_left This is a numeric value in megabytes
that tells the audit daemon when to perform a configurable
action because the system is run- ning low on disk space.
This should be considered the last chance to do something
before running out of disk space. The numeric value for this
parameter should be lower than the number for
space_left.</p>

<p>admin_space_left_action This parameter tells the system
what action to take when the system has detected that it is
low on disk space. Valid values are ignore, syslog, rotate,
email, exec, suspend, single, and halt. If set to ignore,
the audit daemon does nothing. Syslog means that it will
issue a warning to syslog. rotate will rotate logs, losing
the oldest to free up space. Email means that it will send a
warning to the email account specified in action_mail_acct
as well as sending the message to syslog. exec
/path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass
parame- ters to the script. The script is also responsible
for telling the auditd daemon to resume logging once its
completed its action. This can be done by adding service
auditd resume to the script. Suspend will cause the audit
daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will
still be alive. The single option will cause the audit
daemon to put the computer system in single user mode. The
halt option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the
computer system.</p>

<p>disk_full_action This parameter tells the system what
action to take when the system has detected that the
partition to which log files are written has become full.
Valid values are ignore, syslog, rotate, exec, suspend,
single, and halt. If set to ignore, the audit daemon will
issue a syslog message but no other action is taken. Syslog
means that it will issue a warning to syslog. rotate will
rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up space. exec
/path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass
parameters to the script. The script is also responsible for
telling the auditd daemon to resume loggin g once its
completed its action. This can be done by adding service
auditd resume to the script. Suspend will cause the audit
daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will
still be alive. The single option will cause the audit
daemon to put the computer system in single user mode. halt
option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer
system.</p>

<p>disk_error_action This parameter tells the system what
action to take whenever there is an error detected when
writing audit events to disk or rotating logs. Valid values
are ignore, syslog, exec, suspend, single, and halt. If set
to ignore, the audit daemon will not take any action. Syslog
means that it will issue no more than 5 consecutive warnings
to syslog. exec /path-to-script will exe- cute the script.
You cannot pass parameters to the script. Sus- pend will
cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk.
The daemon will still be alive. The single option will cause
the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user
mode. halt option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown
the computer system.</p>

<p>tcp_listen_port This is a numeric value in the range
1..65535 which, if speci- fied, causes auditd to listen on
the corresponding TCP port for audit records from remote
systems. The audit daemon may be linked with tcp_wrappers.
You may want to control access with an entry in the
hosts.allow and deny files.</p>

<p>tcp_listen_queue This is a numeric value which indicates
how many pending (requested but unaccepted) connections are
allowed. The default is 5. Setting this too small may cause
connections to be rejected if too many hosts start up at
exactly the same time, such as after a power failure.</p>

<p>tcp_max_per_addr This is a numeric value which indicates
how many concurrent con- nections from one IP address is
allowed. The default is 1 and the maximum is 1024. Setting
this too large may allow for a Denial of Service attack on
the logging server. Also note that the kernel has an
internal maximum that will eventually prevent this even if
auditd allows it by config. The default should be adequate
in most cases unless a custom written recovery script runs
to forward unsent events. In this case you would increase
the number only large enough to let it in too.</p>

<p>use_libwrap This setting determines whether or not to
use tcp_wrappers to discern connection attempts that are
from allowed machines. Legal values are either yes, or no
The default value is yes.</p>

<p>tcp_client_ports This parameter may be a single numeric
value or two values sepa- rated by a dash (no spaces
allowed). It indicates which client ports are allowed for
incoming connections. If not specified, any port is allowed.
Allowed values are 1..65535. For example, to require the
client use a priviledged port, specify 1-1023 for this
parameter. You will also need to set the local_port option
in the audisp-remote.conf file. Making sure that clients
send from a privileged port is a security feature to prevent
log injection attacks by untrusted users.</p>

<p>tcp_client_max_idle This parameter indicates the number
of seconds that a client may be idle (i.e. no data from them
at all) before auditd complains. This is used to close
inactive connections if the client machine has a problem
where it cannot shutdown the connection cleanly. Note that
this is a global setting, and must be higher than any
individual client heartbeat_timeout setting, preferably by a
factor of two. The default is zero, which disables this
check.</p>

<p>enable_krb5 If set to &quot;yes&quot;, Kerberos 5 will
be used for authentication and encryption. The default is
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>krb5_principal This is the principal for this server.
The default is &quot;auditd&quot;. Given this default, the
server will look for a key named like
auditd/hostname@EXAMPLE.COM stored in /etc/audit/audit.key
to authenticate itself, where hostname is the canonical name
for the servers host, as returned by a DNS lookup of its IP
address.</p>

<p>krb5_key_file Location of the key for this clients
principal. Note that the key file must be owned by root and
mode 0400. The default is /etc/audit/audit.key</p>

<p>NOTES In a CAPP environment, the audit trail is
considered so important that access to system resources must
be denied if an audit trail cannot be created. In this
environment, it would be suggested that /var/log/audit be on
its own partition. This is to ensure that space detection is
accurate and that no other process comes along and consumes
part of it.</p>

<p>The flush parameter should be set to sync or data.</p>

<p>Max_log_file and num_logs need to be adjusted so that
you get complete use of your partition. It should be noted
that the more files that have to be rotated, the longer it
takes to get back to receiving audit events.
Max_log_file_action should be set to keep_logs.</p>

<p>Space_left should be set to a number that gives the
admin enough time to react to any alert message and perform
some maintenance to free up disk space. This would typically
involve running the aureport -t report and moving the oldest
logs to an archive area. The value of space_left is site
dependent since the rate at which events are generated
varies with each deployment. The space_left_action is
recommended to be set to email. If you need something like
an snmp trap, you can use the exec option to send one.</p>

<p>Admin_space_left should be set to the amount of disk
space on the audit partition needed for admin actions to be
recorded. Admin_space_left_action would be set to single so
that use of the machine is restricted to just the
console.</p>

<p>The disk_full_action is triggered when no more room
exists on the par- tition. All access should be terminated
since no more audit capability exists. This can be set to
either single or halt.</p>

<p>The disk_error_action should be set to syslog, single,
or halt depend- ing on your local policies regarding
handling of hardware malfunctions.</p>

<p>Specifying a single allowed client port may make it
difficult for the client to restart their audit subsystem,
as it will be unable to recre- ate a connection with the
same host addresses and ports until the con- nection closure
TIME_WAIT state times out.</p>
