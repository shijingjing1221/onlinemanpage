<p>ABORT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ABORT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME abort - generate an abnormal process abort</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void abort(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The abort() function shall cause abnormal
process termination to occur, unless the signal SIGABRT is
being caught and the signal handler does not return.</p>

<p>The abnormal termination processing shall include the
default actions defined for SIGABRT and may include an
attempt to effect fclose() on all open streams.</p>

<p>The SIGABRT signal shall be sent to the calling process
as if by means of raise() with the argument SIGABRT.</p>

<p>The status made available to wait() or waitpid() by
abort() shall be that of a process terminated by the SIGABRT
signal. The abort() func- tion shall override blocking or
ignoring the SIGABRT signal.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The abort() function shall not return.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Catching the signal is intended to
provide the application writer with a portable means to
abort processing, free from possible interference from any
implementation-defined functions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard requires the
abort() function to be async-signal-safe. Since IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 defers to the ISO C stan- dard, this required a
change to the DESCRIPTION from shall include the effect of
fclose() to may include an attempt to effect fclose().</p>

<p>The revised wording permits some backwards-compatibility
and avoids a potential deadlock situation.</p>

<p>The Open Group Base Resolution bwg2002-003 is applied,
removing the following XSI shaded paragraph from the
DESCRIPTION:</p>

<p>On XSI-conformant systems, in addition the abnormal
termination pro- cessing shall include the effect of
fclose() on message catalog descriptors.</p>

<p>There were several reasons to remove this paragraph:</p>

<p>* No special processing of open message catalogs needs
to be performed prior to abnormal process termination.</p>

<p>* The main reason to specifically mention that abort()
includes the effect of fclose() on open streams is to flush
output queued on the stream. Message catalogs in this
context are read-only and, there- fore, do not need to be
flushed.</p>

<p>* The effect of fclose() on a message catalog descriptor
is unspeci- fied. Message catalog descriptors are allowed,
but not required to be implemented using a file descriptor,
but there is no mention in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 of a message
catalog descriptor using a stan- dard I/O stream FILE object
as would be expected by fclose().</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

waitpid(), the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>
