<p>CBRT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CBRT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cbrt, cbrtf, cbrtl - cube root functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double cbrt(double x); float cbrtf(float x); long double
cbrtl(long double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the real cube
root of their argument x.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the cube root of x.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0 or &plusmn;Inf, x shall be
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE For some applications, a true cube root
function, which returns nega- tive results for negative
arguments, is more appropriate than pow( x, 1.0/3.0), which
returns a NaN for x less than 0.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
