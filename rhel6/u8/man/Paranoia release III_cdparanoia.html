<p>NAME cdparanoia 10.2 (Paranoia release III) - an audio
CD reading utility which includes extra data verification
features</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cdparanoia [options] span [outfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cdparanoia retrieves audio tracks from CDDA
capable CDROM drives. The data can be saved to a file or
directed to standard output in WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C or raw
format. Most ATAPI, SCSI and several proprietary CDROM drive
makes are supported; cdparanoia can determine if the target
drive is CDDA capable.</p>

<p>In addition to simple reading, cdparanoia adds
extra-robust data veri- fication, synchronization, error
handling and scratch reconstruction capability.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A --analyze-drive Run and log a complete
analysis of drive caching, timing and reading behavior;
verifies that cdparanoia is correctly mod- elling a sprcific
drives cache and read behavior. Implies -vQL.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Be absurdly verbose about the autosensing
and reading process. Good for setup and debugging.</p>

<p>-q --quiet Do not print any progress or error
information during the read- ing process.</p>

<p>-e --stderr-progress Force output of progress
information to stderr (for wrapper scripts).</p>

<p>-l --log-summary [file] Save result summary to file,
default filename cdparanoia.log.</p>

<p>-L --log-debug [file] Save detailed device autosense and
debugging output to a file, default filename
cdparanoia.log.</p>

<p>-V --version Print the program version and quit.</p>

<p>-Q --query Perform CDROM drive autosense, query and
print the CDROM table of contents, then quit.</p>

<p>-s --search-for-drive Forces a complete search for a
cdrom drive, even if the /dev/cdrom link exists.</p>

<p>-h --help Print a brief synopsis of cdparanoia usage and
options.</p>

<p>-p --output-raw Output headerless data as raw 16 bit PCM
data with interleaved samples in host byte order. To force
little or big endian byte order, use -r or -R as described
below.</p>

<p>-r --output-raw-little-endian Output headerless data as
raw 16 bit PCM data with interleaved samples in LSB first
byte order.</p>

<p>-R --output-raw-big-endian Output headerless data as raw
16 bit PCM data with interleaved samples in MSB first byte
order.</p>

<p>-w --output-wav Output data in Micro$oft RIFF WAV format
(note that WAV data is always LSB first byte order).</p>

<p>-f --output-aiff Output data in Apple AIFF format (note
that AIFC data is always in MSB first byte order).</p>

<p>-a --output-aifc Output data in uncompressed Apple
AIFF-C format (note that AIFF- C data is always in MSB first
byte order).</p>

<p>-B --batch</p>

<p>Cdda2wav-style batch output flag; cdparanoia will split
the out- put into multiple files at track boundaries. Output
file names are prepended with track#.</p>

<p>-c --force-cdrom-little-endian Some CDROM drives
misreport their endianness (or do not report it at all); its
possible that cdparanoia will guess wrong. Use -c to force
cdparanoia to treat the drive as a little endian device.</p>

<p>-C --force-cdrom-big-endian As above but force
cdparanoia to treat the drive as a big endian device.</p>

<p>-n --force-default-sectors n Force the interface backend
to do atomic reads of n sectors per read. This number can be
misleading; the kernel will often split read requests into
multiple atomic reads (the automated Paranoia code is aware
of this) or allow reads only wihin a restricted size range.
This option should generally not be used.</p>

<p>-d --force-cdrom-device device Force the interface
backend to read from device rather than the first readable
CDROM drive it finds. This can be used to specify devices of
any valid interface type (ATAPI, SCSI or pro- prietary).</p>

<p>-k --force-cooked-device device This option forces use
of the old cooked ioctl kernel inter- face with the
specified cdrom device. The cooked ioctl inter- face is
obsolete in Linux 2.6 if it is present at all. -k can- not
be used with -d or -g.</p>

<p>-g --force-generic-device device This option forces use
of the old generic scsi (sg) kernel interface with the
specified generic scsi device. -g cannot be used with -k. -g
may be used with -d to explicitly set both the SCSI cdrom
and generic (sg) devices seperately. This option is only
useful on obsolete SCSI setups and when using the generic
scsi (sg) driver.</p>

<p>-S --force-read-speed number Use this option explicitly
to set the read rate of the CD drive (where supported). This
can reduce underruns on machines with slow disks, or which
are low on memory.</p>

<p>-t --toc-offset number Use this option to force the
entire disc LBA addressing to shift by the given amount; the
value is added to the beginning offsets in the TOC. This can
be used to shift track boundaries for the whole disc
manually on sector granularity. The next option does
something similar...</p>

<p>-T --toc-bias Some drives (usually random Toshibas)
report the actual track beginning offset values in the TOC,
but then treat the beginning of track 1 index 1 as sector 0
for all read operations. This results in every track seeming
to start too late (losing a bit of the beginning and
catching a bit of the next track). -T accounts for this
behavior. Note that this option will cause cdparanoia to
attempt to read sectors before or past the known user data
area of the disc, resulting in read errors at disc edges on
most drives and possibly even hard lockups on some buggy
hardware.</p>

<p>-O --sample-offset number Use this option to force the
entire disc to shift sample posi- tion output by the given
amount; This can be used to shift track boundaries for the
whole disc manually on sample granularity. Note that this
will cause cdparanoia to attempt to read partial sectors
before or past the known user data area of the disc,
probably causing read errors on most drives and possibly
even hard lockups on some buggy hardware.</p>

<p>-Z --disable-paranoia Disable all data verification and
correction features. When using -Z, cdparanoia reads data
exactly as would cdda2wav with an overlap setting of zero.
This option implies that -Y is active.</p>

<p>-z --never-skip[=max_retries] Do not accept any skips;
retry forever if needed. An optional maximum number of
retries can be specified; for comparison, default without -z
is currently 20.</p>

<p>-Y --disable-extra-paranoia Disables intra-read data
verification; only overlap checking at read boundaries is
performed. It can wedge if errors occur in the attempted
overlap area. Not recommended.</p>

<p>-X --abort-on-skip If the read skips due to imperfect
data, a scratch, whatever, abort reading this track. If
output is to a file, delete the partially completed
file.</p>

<p>OUTPUT SMILIES :-) Normal operation, low/no jitter</p>

<p>:-| Normal operation, considerable jitter</p>

<p>:-/ Read drift</p>

<p>:-P Unreported loss of streaming in atomic read
operation</p>

<p>8-| Finding read problems at same point during reread;
hard to cor- rect</p>

<p>:-0 SCSI/ATAPI transport error</p>

<p>:-( Scratch detected</p>

<p>;-( Gave up trying to perform a correction</p>

<p>8-X Aborted read due to known, uncorrectable error</p>

<p>:^D Finished extracting</p>

<p>PROGRESS BAR SYMBOLS &lt;space&gt; No corrections
needed</p>

<p>- Jitter correction required</p>

<p>+ Unreported loss of streaming/other error in read</p>

<p>! Errors found after stage 1 correction; the drive is
making the same error through multiple re-reads, and
cdparanoia is having trouble detecting them.</p>

<p>e SCSI/ATAPI transport error (corrected)</p>

<p>V Uncorrected error/skip</p>

<p>SPAN ARGUMENT The span argument specifies which track,
tracks or subsections of tracks to read. This argument is
required. NOTE: Unless the span is a simple number, its
generally a good idea to quote the span argument to protect
it from the shell.</p>

<p>The span argument may be a simple track number or an
offset/span speci- fication. The syntax of an offset/span
takes the rough form:</p>

<p>1[ww:xx:yy.zz]-2[aa:bb:cc.dd]</p>

<p>Here, 1 and 2 are track numbers; the numbers in brackets
provide a finer grained offset within a particular track.
[aa:bb:cc.dd] is in hours/minutes/seconds/sectors format.
Zero fields need not be specified: [::20], [:20], [20],
[20.], etc, would be interpreted as twenty seconds, [10:]
would be ten minutes, [.30] would be thirty sec- tors (75
sectors per second).</p>

<p>When only a single offset is supplied, it is interpreted
as a starting offset and ripping will continue to the end of
the track. If a single offset is preceeded or followed by a
hyphen, the implicit missing off- set is taken to be the
start or end of the disc, respectively. Thus:</p>

<p>1:[20.35] Specifies ripping from track 1, second 20,
sector 35 to the end of track 1.</p>

<p>1:[20.35]- Specifies ripping from 1[20.35] to the end of
the disc</p>

<p>-2 Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up
to (and including) track 2</p>

<p>-2:[30.35] Specifies ripping from the beginning of the
disc up to 2:[30.35]</p>

<p>2-4 Specifies ripping from the beginning of track 2 to
the end of track 4.</p>

<p>Again, don t forget to protect square brackets and
preceeding hyphens from the shell.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A few examples, protected from the shell:</p>

<p>Query only with exhaustive search for a drive and full
reporting of autosense:</p>

<p>cdparanoia -vsQ</p>

<p>Extract an entire disc, putting each track in a seperate
file:</p>

<p>cdparanoia -B</p>

<p>Extract from track 1, time 0:30.12 to 1:10.00:</p>

<p>cdparanoia &quot;1[:30.12]-1[1:10]&quot;</p>

<p>Extract from the beginning of the disc up to track
3:</p>

<p>cdparanoia -- &quot;-3&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;--&quot; above is to distinguish
&quot;-3&quot; from an option flag.</p>

<p>OUTPUT The output file argument is optional; if it is
not specified, cdpara- noia will output samples to one of
cdda.wav, cdda.aifc, or cdda.raw depending on whether -w,
-a, -r or -R is used (-w is the implicit default). The
output file argument of - specifies standard output; all
data formats may be piped.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Cdparanoia sprang from and once drew
heavily from the interface of Heiko Eissfeldts
(heiko@colossus.escape.de) cdda2wav package. Cdparanoia
would not have happened without it.</p>

<p>Joerg Schilling has also contributed SCSI expertise
through his generic SCSI transport library.</p>
