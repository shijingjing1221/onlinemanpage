<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME case - Evaluate one of several scripts, depending
on a given value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS case string ?in? patList body ?patList body
...?</p>

<p>case string ?in? {patList body ?patList body ...?}
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note: the case command is obsolete and is
supported only for backward compatibility. At some point in
the future it may be removed entirely. You should use the
switch command instead.</p>

<p>The case command matches string against each of the
patList arguments in order. Each patList argument is a list
of one or more patterns. If any of these patterns matches
string then case evaluates the following body argument by
passing it recursively to the Tcl interpreter and returns
the result of that evaluation. Each patList argument
consists of a single pattern or list of patterns. Each
pattern may contain any of the wild-cards described under
string match. If a patList argument is default, the
corresponding body will be evaluated if no patList matches
string. If no patList argument matches string and no default
is given, then the case command returns an empty string.</p>

<p>Two syntaxes are provided for the patList and body
arguments. The first uses a separate argument for each of
the patterns and commands; this form is convenient if
substitutions are desired on some of the patterns or
commands. The second form places all of the patterns and
commands together into a single argument; the argument must
have proper list structure, with the elements of the list
being the patterns and commands. The second form makes it
easy to construct multi-line case commands, since the braces
around the whole list make it unnecessary to include a
backslash at the end of each line. Since the patList argu-
ments are in braces in the second form, no command or
variable substi- tutions are performed on them; this makes
the behavior of the second form different than the first
form in some cases.</p>
