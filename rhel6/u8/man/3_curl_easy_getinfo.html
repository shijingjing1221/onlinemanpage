<p>curl_easy_getinfo(3) libcurl Manual
curl_easy_getinfo(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_easy_getinfo - extract information from a curl
handle</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *curl, CURLINFO info,
... );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Request internal information from the curl
session with this function. The third argument MUST be a
pointer to a long, a pointer to a char *, a pointer to a
struct curl_slist * or a pointer to a double (as this
documentation describes further down). The data pointed-to
will be filled in accordingly and can be relied upon only if
the function returns CURLE_OK. Use this function AFTER a
performed transfer if you want to get transfer- oriented
data.</p>

<p>You should not free the memory returned by this function
unless it is explicitly mentioned below.</p>

<p>AVAILABLE INFORMATION The following information can be
extracted:</p>

<p>CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL Pass a pointer to a char pointer
to receive the last used effec- tive URL.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the last received HTTP or FTP code. This option was
known as CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE in libcurl 7.10.7 and earlier.
This will be zero if no server response code has been
received. Note that a proxys CONNECT response should be read
with CURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE and not this.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the last received proxy response code to a CONNECT
request.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_FILETIME Pass a pointer to a long to receive
the remote time of the retrieved document (in number of
seconds since 1 jan 1970 in the GMT/UTC time zone). If you
get -1, it can be because of many reasons (unknown, the
server hides it or the server doesnt sup- port the command
that tells document time etc) and the time of the document
is unknown. Note that you must tell the server to collect
this information before the transfer is made, by using the
CURLOPT_FILETIME option to curl_easy_setopt(3) or you will
unconditionally get a -1 back. (Added in 7.5)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total time in seconds for the previous transfer,
including name resolving, TCP connect etc.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the name resolving was completed.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the SSL/SSH connect/handshake to the remote host was
completed. This time is most often very near to the
PRETRANSFER time, except for cases such as HTTP pippelining
where the pretransfer time can be delayed due to waits in
line for the pipeline and more. (Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start until
the file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all
pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to
the particular protocol(s) involved.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME Pass a pointer to a double
to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the start
until the first byte is just about to be transferred. This
includes CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME and also the time the
server needs to calculate the result.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total time, in sec- onds, it took for all
redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer
and transfer before final transaction was started.
CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME contains the complete execution time
for multiple redirections. (Added in 7.9.7)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the total number of redirec- tions that were
actually followed. (Added in 7.9.7)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL Pass a pointer to a char pointer
to receive the URL a redirect would take you to if you would
enable CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION. This can come very handy if
you think using the built-in libcurl redirect logic isnt
good enough for you but you would still prefer to avoid
implementing all the magic of figuring out the new URL.
(Added in 7.18.2)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_SIZE_UPLOAD Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total amount of bytes that were uploaded.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the total amount of bytes that were downloaded. The
amount is only for the latest transfer and will be reset
again for each new transfer.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the average download speed that curl measured for
the complete download. Measured in bytes/second.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_SPEED_UPLOAD Pass a pointer to a double to
receive the average upload speed that curl measured for the
complete upload. Measured in bytes/second.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE Pass a pointer to a long to receive
the total size of all the headers received. Measured in
number of bytes.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_REQUEST_SIZE Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the total size of the issued requests. This is so
far only for HTTP requests. Note that this may be more than
one request if FOLLOWLOCATION is true.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the result of the certifica- tion verification that
was requested (using the CURLOPT_SSL_VER- IFYPEER option to
curl_easy_setopt(3)).</p>

<p>CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES Pass the address of a struct
curl_slist * to receive a linked- list of OpenSSL
crypto-engines supported. Note that engines are normally
implemented in separate dynamic libraries. Hence not all the
returned engines may be available at run-time. NOTE: you
must call curl_slist_free_all(3) on the list pointer once
youre done with it, as libcurl will not free the data for
you. (Added in 7.12.3)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD Pass a pointer to a
double to receive the content-length of the download. This
is the value read from the Content-Length: field. Since
7.19.4, this returns -1 if the size isnt known.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_UPLOAD Pass a pointer to a
double to receive the specified size of the upload. Since
7.19.4, this returns -1 if the size isnt known.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE Pass a pointer to a char pointer
to receive the content-type of the downloaded object. This
is the value read from the Content- Type: field. If you get
NULL, it means that the server didnt send a valid
Content-Type header or that the protocol used doesnt support
this.</p>

<p>CURLINFO_PRIVATE Pass a pointer to a char pointer to
receive the pointer to the private data associated with the
curl handle (set with the CUR- LOPT_PRIVATE option to
curl_easy_setopt(3)). Please note that for internal reasons,
the value is returned as a char pointer, although
effectively being a void * . (Added in 7.10.3)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_AVAIL Pass a pointer to a long to
receive a bitmask indicating the authentication method(s)
available. The meaning of the bits is explained in the
CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH option for curl_easy_setopt(3). (Added in
7.10.8)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_AVAIL Pass a pointer to a long to
receive a bitmask indicating the authentication method(s)
available for your proxy authentica- tion. (Added in
7.10.8)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO Pass a pointer to a long to receive
the errno variable from a connect failure. Note that the
value is only set on failure, it is not reset upon a
successful operation. (Added in 7.12.2)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_NUM_CONNECTS Pass a pointer to a long to
receive how many new connections libcurl had to create to
achieve the previous transfer (only the successful connects
are counted). Combined with CURLINFO_REDI- RECT_COUNT you
are able to know how many times libcurl success- fully
reused existing connection(s) or not. See the Connection
Options of curl_easy_setopt(3) to see how libcurl tries to
make persistent connections to save time. (Added in
7.12.3)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_PRIMARY_IP Pass a pointer to a char pointer to
receive the pointer to a zero-terminated string holding the
IP address of the most recent connection done with this curl
handle. This string may be IPv6 if thats enabled. Note that
you get a pointer to a memory area that will be re-used at
next request so you need to copy the string if you want to
keep the information. (Added in 7.19.0)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_COOKIELIST Pass a pointer to a struct
curl_slist * to receive a linked- list of all cookies cURL
knows (expired ones, too). Dont forget to
curl_slist_free_all(3) the list after it has been used. If
there are no cookies (cookies for the handle have not been
enabled or simply none have been received) struct curl_slist
* will be set to point to NULL. (Added in 7.14.1)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET Pass a pointer to a long to receive
the last socket used by this curl session. If the socket is
no longer valid, -1 is returned. When you finish working
with the socket, you must call curl_easy_cleanup() as usual
and let libcurl close the socket and cleanup other resources
associated with the handle. This is typically used in
combination with CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY. (Added in 7.15.2)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH Pass a pointer to a char pointer
to receive a pointer to a string holding the path of the
entry path. That is the initial path libcurl ended up in
when logging on to the remote FTP server. This stores a NULL
as pointer if something is wrong. (Added in 7.15.4)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_CERTINFO Pass a pointer to a struct
curl_certinfo * and youll get it set to point to struct that
holds a number of linked lists with info about the
certificate chain, assuming you had CURLOPT_CERT- INFO
enabled when the previous request was done. The struct
reports how many certs it found and then you can extract
info for each of those certs by following the linked lists.
The info chain is provided in a series of data in the format
&quot;name:con- tent&quot; where the content is for the
specific named data. See also the certinfo.c example. NOTE:
this option is only available in libcurl built with OpenSSL
support. (Added in 7.19.1)</p>

<p>CURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET Pass a pointer to a long to
receive the number 1 if the condi- tion provided in the
previous request didn t match (see CUR- LOPT_TIMECONDITION).
Alas, if this returns a 1 you know that the reason you didnt
get data in return is because it didnt ful- fill the
condition. The long ths argument points to will get a zero
stored if the condition instead was met. (Added in
7.19.4)</p>

<p>TIMES An overview of the six time values available from
curl_easy_getinfo()</p>

<p>curl_easy_perform() | |--NAMELOOKUP |--|--CONNECT
|--|--|--APPCONNECT |--|--|--|--PRETRANSFER
|--|--|--|--|--STARTTRANSFER |--|--|--|--|--|--TOTAL
|--|--|--|--|--|--REDIRECT</p>

<p>NAMELOOKUP CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME. The time it took
from the start until the name resolving was completed.</p>

<p>CONNECT CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME. The time it took from the
start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was
completed.</p>

<p>APPCONNECT CURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME. The time it took
from the start until the SSL connect/handshake with the
remote host was completed. (Added in in 7.19.0)</p>

<p>PRETRANSFER CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME. The time it took
from the start until the file transfer is just about to
begin. This includes all pre- transfer commands and
negotiations that are specific to the par- ticular
protocol(s) involved.</p>

<p>STARTTRANSFER CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME. The time it
took from the start until the first byte is just about to be
transferred.</p>

<p>TOTAL CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME. Total time of the previous
request.</p>

<p>REDIRECT CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME. The time it took for
all redirection steps include name lookup, connect,
pretransfer and transfer before final transaction was
started. So, this is zero if no redirection took place.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the operation was successful, CURLE_OK
is returned. Otherwise an appropriate error code will be
returned.</p>
