<p>NAME i2cdump - examine I2C registers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS i2cdump [-f] [-r first-last] [-y] i2cbus
address [mode [bank [bankreg]]] i2cdump -V</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION i2cdump is a small helper program to examine
registers visible through the I2C bus.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Display the version and exit.</p>

<p>-f Force access to the device even if it is already
busy. By default, i2cdump will refuse to access a device
which is already under the control of a kernel driver. Using
this flag is danger- ous, it can seriously confuse the
kernel driver in question. It can also cause i2cdump to
return invalid results. So use at your own risk and only if
you know what youre doing.</p>

<p>-r first-last Limit the range of registers being
accessed. This option is only available with modes b, w, c
and W. For mode W, first must be even and last must be
odd.</p>

<p>-y Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cdump will
wait for a confirmation from the user before messing with
the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the
operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p>At least two options must be provided to i2cdump. i2cbus
indicates the number or name of the I2C bus to be scanned.
This number should corre- spond to one of the busses listed
by i2cdetect -l. address indicates the address to be scanned
on that bus, and is an integer between 0x03 and 0x77.</p>

<p>The mode parameter, if specified, is one of the letters
b, w, s, or i, corresponding to a read size of a single
byte, a 16-bit word, an SMBus block, an I2C block,
respectively. The c mode is a little different, it reads all
bytes consecutively, and is useful for chips that have an
address auto-increment feature, such as EEPROMs. The W mode
is also special, it is similar to w except that a read
command will only be issued on even register addresses; this
is again mainly useful for EEP- ROMs.</p>

<p>A p can also be appended to the mode parameter (except
for i and W) to enable PEC. If the mode parameter is
omitted, i2cdump defaults to byte access without PEC.</p>

<p>The bank and bankreg parameters are useful on the
W83781D and similar chips (at the time of writing, all
Winbond and Asus chips). bank is an integer between 0 and 7,
and bankreg is an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF (default
value: 0x4E). The W83781D data sheet has more information on
bank selection.</p>

<p>WARNING i2cdump can be dangerous if used improperly.
Most notably, the c mode starts with WRITING a byte to the
chip. On most chips it will be stored in the address pointer
register, which is OK, but some chips with a single register
or no (visible) register at all will most likely see this as
a real WRITE, resulting in possible misbehavior or
corruption. Do not use i2cdump on random addresses. Anyway,
it is of little use unless you have good knowledge of the
chip youre working with and an idea of what you are looking
for.</p>
