<p>GIT-MERGE-BASE(1) Git Manual GIT-MERGE-BASE(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-merge-base - Find as good common ancestors as
possible for a merge</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git merge-base [-a|--all] &lt;commit&gt;
&lt;commit&gt;...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION git merge-base finds best common ancestor(s)
between two commits to use in a three-way merge. One common
ancestor is better than another common ancestor if the
latter is an ancestor of the former. A common ancestor that
does not have any better common ancestor is a best common
ancestor, i.e. a merge base. Note that there can be more
than one merge base for a pair of commits.</p>

<p>Among the two commits to compute the merge base from,
one is specified by the first commit argument on the command
line; the other commit is a (possibly hypothetical) commit
that is a merge across all the remaining commits on the
command line. As the most common special case, specifying
only two commits on the command line means computing the
merge base between the given two commits.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the merge base is not necessarily
contained in each of the commit arguments if more than two
commits are specified. This is different from
git-show-branch(1) when used with the --merge-base
option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --all Output all merge bases for the
commits, instead of just one.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION Given two commits A and B, git merge-base A B
will output a commit which is reachable from both A and B
through the parent relationship.</p>

<p>For example, with this topology:</p>

<p>o---o---o---B / ---o---1---o---o---o---A</p>

<p>the merge base between A and B is 1.</p>

<p>Given three commits A, B and C, git merge-base A B C
will compute the merge base between A and a hypothetical
commit M, which is a merge between B and C. For example,
with this topology:</p>

<p>o---o---o---o---C / / o---o---o---B / /
---2---1---o---o---o---A</p>

<p>the result of git merge-base A B C is 1. This is because
the equivalent topology with a merge commit M between B and
C is:</p>

<p>o---o---o---o---o / / o---o---o---o---M / /
---2---1---o---o---o---A</p>

<p>and the result of git merge-base A M is 1. Commit 2 is
also a common ancestor between A and M, but 1 is a better
common ancestor, because 2 is an ancestor of 1. Hence, 2 is
not a merge base.</p>

<p>When the history involves criss-cross merges, there can
be more than one best common ancestor for two commits. For
example, with this topology:</p>

<p>---1---o---A / X / ---2---o---o---B</p>

<p>both 1 and 2 are merge-bases of A and B. Neither one is
better than the other (both are best merge bases). When the
--all option is not given, it is unspecified which best one
is output.</p>
