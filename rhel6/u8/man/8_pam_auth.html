<p>NAME pam_auth - Squid PAM authentication helper</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS squid_pam_auth [-n &quot;service name&quot;]
[-t TTL] [-o] [-1]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This helper allows Squid to connect to a
mostly any available PAM database to validate the user name
and password of Basic HTTP authenti- cation.</p>

<p>-s service-name Specifies the PAM service name Squid
uses, defaults to &quot;squid&quot;</p>

<p>-t TTL Enables persistent PAM connections where the
connection to the PAM database is kept open and reused for
new logins. The TTL specifies how long the connection will
be kept open (in sec- onds). Default is to not keep PAM
connections open. Please note that the use of persistent PAM
connections is slightly outside the PAM specification and
may not work with all PAM configura- tions.</p>

<p>-o Do not perform the PAM account management group
(account expira- tion etc)</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The program needs a PAM service to be
configured in /etc/pam.conf or
/etc/pam.d/&lt;servicename&gt;</p>

<p>The default service name is &quot;squid&quot;, and the
program makes use of the auth and account management groups
to verify the password and the accounts validity.</p>

<p>For details on how to configure PAM services, see the
PAM documentation for your system. This manual does not
cover PAM configuration details.</p>

<p>NOTES When used for authenticating to local UNIX shadow
password databases the program must be running as root or
else it wont have sufficient permissions to access the user
password database. Such use of this pro- gram is not
recommended, but if you absolutely need to then make the
program setuid root</p>

<p>chown root pam_auth chmod u+s pam_auth</p>

<p>Please note that in such configurations it is also
strongly recommended that the program is moved into a
directory where normal users cannot access it, as this mode
of operation will allow any local user to brute-force other
users passwords. Also note the program has not been fully
audited and the author cannot be held responsible for any
secu- rity issues due to such installations.</p>
