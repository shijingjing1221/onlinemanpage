<p>PTHREAD_GETCONCURRENCY(3P) POSIX Programmer s
ManualPTHREAD_GETCONCURRENCY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_getconcurrency, pthread_setconcurrency -
get and set the level of concurrency</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_getconcurrency(void); int
pthread_setconcurrency(int new_level);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Unbound threads in a process may or may not
be required to be simulta- neously active. By default, the
threads implementation ensures that a sufficient number of
threads are active so that the process can con- tinue to
make progress. While this conserves system resources, it may
not produce the most effective level of concurrency.</p>

<p>The pthread_setconcurrency() function allows an
application to inform the threads implementation of its
desired concurrency level, new_level. The actual level of
concurrency provided by the implementation as a result of
this function call is unspecified.</p>

<p>If new_level is zero, it causes the implementation to
maintain the con- currency level at its discretion as if
pthread_setconcurrency() had never been called.</p>

<p>The pthread_getconcurrency() function shall return the
value set by a previous call to the pthread_setconcurrency()
function. If the pthread_setconcurrency() function was not
previously called, this func- tion shall return zero to
indicate that the implementation is maintain- ing the
concurrency level.</p>

<p>A call to pthread_setconcurrency() shall inform the
implementation of its desired concurrency level. The
implementation shall use this as a hint, not a
requirement.</p>

<p>If an implementation does not support multiplexing of
user threads on top of several kernel-scheduled entities,
the pthread_setconcurrency() and pthread_getconcurrency()
functions are provided for source code compatibility but
they shall have no effect when called. To maintain the
function semantics, the new_level parameter is saved when
pthread_setconcurrency() is called so that a subsequent call
to pthread_getconcurrency() shall return the same value.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_setconcurrency()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The pthread_getconcurrency() function shall always
return the concur- rency level set by a previous call to
pthread_setconcurrency(). If the pthread_setconcurrency()
function has never been called, pthread_get- concurrency()
shall return zero.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_setconcurrency() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by new_level is negative.</p>

<p>EAGAIN The value specific by new_level would cause a
system resource to be exceeded.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Use of these functions changes the
state of the underlying concurrency upon which the
application depends. Library developers are advised to not
use the pthread_getconcurrency() and
pthread_setconcurrency() func- tions since their use may
conflict with an applications use of these functions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
