<p>SOCKETPAIR(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SOCKETPAIR(2)</p>

<p>NAME socketpair - create a pair of connected sockets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; /* See NOTES */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int socketpair(int domain, int type, int protocol, int
sv[2]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The socketpair() call creates an unnamed
pair of connected sockets in the specified domain, of the
specified type, and using the optionally specified protocol.
For further details of these arguments, see socket(2).</p>

<p>The descriptors used in referencing the new sockets are
returned in sv[0] and sv[1]. The two sockets are
indistinguishable.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAFNOSUPPORT The specified address family is not
supported on this machine.</p>

<p>EFAULT The address sv does not specify a valid part of
the process address space.</p>

<p>EMFILE Too many descriptors are in use by this
process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The specified protocol does not support
creation of socket pairs.</p>

<p>EPROTONOSUPPORT The specified protocol is not supported
on this machine.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001. The socketpair()
function call appeared in 4.2BSD. It is generally portable
to/from non-BSD systems supporting clones of the BSD socket
layer (including System V variants).</p>

<p>NOTES On Linux, the only supported domain for this call
is AF_UNIX (or syn- onymously, AF_LOCAL). (Most
implementations have the same restric- tion.)</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.27, socketpair() supports the
SOCK_NONBLOCK and SOCK_CLOEXEC flags described in
socket(2).</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;, and this header file is not required on
Linux. However, some historical (BSD) implementations
required this header file, and portable applications are
probably wise to include it.</p>
