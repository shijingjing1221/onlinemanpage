<p>NAME rcsmerge - merge RCS revisions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rcsmerge [options] file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rcsmerge incorporates the changes between
two revisions of an RCS file into the corresponding working
file.</p>

<p>Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all
others denote working files. Names are paired as explained
in ci(1).</p>

<p>At least one revision must be specified with one of the
options described below, usually -r. At most two revisions
may be specified. If only one revision is specified, the
latest revision on the default branch (normally the highest
branch on the trunk) is assumed for the second revision.
Revisions may be specified numerically or symboli-
cally.</p>

<p>rcsmerge prints a warning if there are overlaps, and
delimits the over- lapping regions as explained in merge(1).
The command is useful for incorporating changes into a
checked-out revision.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A Output conflicts using the -A style of
diff3(1), if supported by diff3. This merges all changes
leading from file2 to file3 into file1, and generates the
most verbose output.</p>

<p>-E, -e These options specify conflict styles that
generate less infor- mation than -A. See diff3(1) for
details. The default is -E. With -e, rcsmerge does not warn
about conflicts.</p>

<p>-ksubst Use subst style keyword substitution. See co(1)
for details. For example, -kk -r1.1 -r1.2 ignores
differences in keyword val- ues when merging the changes
from 1.1 to 1.2. It normally does not make sense to merge
binary files as if they were text, so rcsmerge refuses to
merge files if -kb expansion is used.</p>

<p>-p[rev] Send the result to standard output instead of
overwriting the working file.</p>

<p>-q[rev] Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.</p>

<p>-r[rev] Merge with respect to revision rev. Here an
empty rev stands for the latest revision on the default
branch, normally the head.</p>

<p>-T This option has no effect; it is present for
compatibility with other RCS commands.</p>

<p>-V Print RCSs version number.</p>

<p>-Vn Emulate RCS version n. See co(1) for details.</p>

<p>-xsuffixes Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See
ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>-zzone Use zone as the time zone for keyword
substitution. See co(1) for details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Suppose you have released revision 2.8 of f.c.
Assume furthermore that after you complete an unreleased
revision 3.4, you receive updates to release 2.8 from
someone else. To combine the updates to 2.8 and your changes
between 2.8 and 3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c
and execute</p>

<p>rcsmerge -p -r2.8 -r3.4 f.c &gt;f.merged.c</p>

<p>Then examine f.merged.c. Alternatively, if you want to
save the updates to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as
revision 2.8.1.1 and execute co -j:</p>

<p>ci -r2.8.1.1 f.c co -r3.4 -j2.8:2.8.1.1 f.c</p>

<p>As another example, the following command undoes the
changes between revision 2.4 and 2.8 in your currently
checked out revision in f.c.</p>

<p>rcsmerge -r2.8 -r2.4 f.c</p>

<p>Note the order of the arguments, and that f.c will be
overwritten.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RCSINIT options prepended to the argument
list, separated by spaces. See ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is 0 for no overlaps, 1 for some
overlaps, 2 for trouble.</p>
