<p>NAME gnuplot - an interactive plotting program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gnuplot [ X11 options ] [file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive
function plotting program.</p>

<p>If files are given, gnuplot loads each file with the
load command, in the order specified. Gnuplot exits after
the last file is processed.</p>

<p>Here are some of its features:</p>

<p>Plots any number of functions, built up of C operators,
C library func- tions, and some things C doesnt have like
**, sgn(), etc. Also sup- port for plotting data files, to
compare actual data to theoretical curves.</p>

<p>User-defined X and Y ranges (optional auto-ranging),
smart axes scal- ing, smart tic marks.</p>

<p>Labelling of X and Y axes.</p>

<p>User-defined constants and functions.</p>

<p>Support for many output devices and file formats</p>

<p>Shell escapes and command line substitution.</p>

<p>Load and save capability.</p>

<p>Output redirection.</p>

<p>All computations performed in the complex domain. Just
the real part is plotted by default, but functions like
imag() and abs() and arg() are available to override
this.</p>

<p>X11 OPTIONS Gnuplot provides the x11 terminal type for
use with X servers. This terminal type is set automatically
at startup if the DISPLAY environ- ment variable is set, if
the TERM environment variable is set to xterm, or if the
-display command line option is used. For terminal type x11,
gnuplot accepts the standard X Toolkit options and resources
such as geometry, font, and background. See the X(1) man
page for a description of the options. In addition to the X
Toolkit options:</p>

<p>-clear requests that the window be cleared momentarily
before a new plot is displayed.</p>

<p>-gray requests grayscale rendering on grayscale or color
displays. (Grayscale displays receive monochrome rendering
by default.)</p>

<p>-mono forces monochrome rendering on color displays.</p>

<p>-persist lets plot windows survive after main gnuplot
program exits.</p>

<p>-raise raises the plot window after each plot.</p>

<p>-noraise does not raise the plot window after each
plot.</p>

<p>-tvtwm requests that geometry specifications for
position of the window be made relative to the currently
displayed portion of the virtual root.</p>

<p>These options may also be controlled with resources in
your .Xdefaults file. For example: gnuplot*gray: on .</p>

<p>Gnuplot provides a command line option (-pointsize v)
and a resource (gnuplot*pointsize: v) to control the size of
points plotted with the &quot;points&quot; plotting style.
The value v is a real number (greater than 0 and less than
or equal to ten) used as a scaling factor for point sizes.
For example, -pointsize 2 uses points twice the default
size, and -pointsize 0.5 uses points half the normal
size.</p>

<p>For monochrome displays, gnuplot does not honor
foreground or back- ground colors. The default is
black-on-white. -rv or gnuplot*reverseV- ideo: on requests
white-on-black.</p>

<p>For color displays gnuplot honors the following
resources (shown here with default values). The values may
be color names in the X11 rgb.txt file on your system,
hexadecimal RGB color specifications (see X11 doc-
umentation), or a color name followed by a comma and an
intensity value from 0 to 1. For example, blue,.5 means a
half intensity blue.</p>

<p>gnuplot*background: white gnuplot*textColor: black
gnuplot*borderColor: black gnuplot*axisColor: black
gnuplot*line1Color: red gnuplot*line2Color: green
gnuplot*line3Color: blue gnuplot*line4Color: magenta
gnuplot*line5Color: cyan gnuplot*line6Color: sienna
gnuplot*line7Color: orange gnuplot*line8Color: coral</p>

<p>When -gray is selected, gnuplot honors the following
resources for grayscale or color displays (shown here with
default values). Note that the default background is
black.</p>

<p>gnuplot*background: black gnuplot*textGray: white
gnuplot*borderGray: gray50 gnuplot*axisGray: gray50
gnuplot*line1Gray: gray100 gnuplot*line2Gray: gray60
gnuplot*line3Gray: gray80 gnuplot*line4Gray: gray40
gnuplot*line5Gray: gray90 gnuplot*line6Gray: gray50
gnuplot*line7Gray: gray70 gnuplot*line8Gray: gray30</p>

<p>Gnuplot honors the following resources for setting the
width in pixels of plot lines (shown here with default
values.) 0 or 1 means a minimal width line of 1 pixel width.
A value of 2 or 3 may improve the appear- ance of some
plots.</p>

<p>gnuplot*borderWidth: 2 gnuplot*axisWidth: 0
gnuplot*line1Width: 0 gnuplot*line2Width: 0
gnuplot*line3Width: 0 gnuplot*line4Width: 0
gnuplot*line5Width: 0 gnuplot*line6Width: 0
gnuplot*line7Width: 0 gnuplot*line8Width: 0</p>

<p>Gnuplot honors the following resources for setting the
dash style used for plotting lines. 0 means a solid line. A
2 digit number jk (j and k are &gt;= 1 and &lt;= 9) means a
dashed line with a repeated pattern of j pixels on followed
by k pixels off. For example, 16 is a &quot;dotted&quot;
line with 1 pixel on followed by 6 pixels off. More
elaborate on/off patterns can be specified with a 4 digit
value. For example, 4441 is 4 on, 4 off, 4 on, 1 off. The
default values shown below are for monochrome displays or
monochrome rendering on color or grayscale dis- plays. For
color displays, the defaults for all are 0 (solid line)
except for axisDashes which defaults to a 16 dotted
line.</p>

<p>gnuplot*borderDashes: 0 gnuplot*axisDashes: 16
gnuplot*line1Dashes: 0 gnuplot*line2Dashes: 42
gnuplot*line3Dashes: 13 gnuplot*line4Dashes: 44
gnuplot*line5Dashes: 15 gnuplot*line6Dashes: 4441
gnuplot*line7Dashes: 42 gnuplot*line8Dashes: 13</p>

<p>The size or aspect ratio of a plot may be changed by
resizing the gnu- plot window.</p>
