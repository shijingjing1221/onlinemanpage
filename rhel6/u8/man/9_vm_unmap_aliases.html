<p>NAME vm_unmap_aliases - unmap outstanding lazy aliases
in the vmap layer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void vm_unmap_aliases(void);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS void no arguments</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The vmap/vmalloc layer lazily flushes kernel
virtual mappings primarily to amortize TLB flushing
overheads. What this means is that any page you have now,
may, in a former life, have been mapped into kernel virtual
address by the vmap layer and so there might be some CPUs
with TLB entries still referencing that page (additional to
the regular 1:1 kernel mapping).</p>

<p>vm_unmap_aliases flushes all such lazy mappings. After
it returns, we can be sure that none of the pages we have
control over will have any aliases from the vmap layer.</p>
