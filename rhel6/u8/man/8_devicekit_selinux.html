<p>NAME devicekit_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the devicekit processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
devicekit processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The devicekit processes execute with the devicekit_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep devicekit_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The devicekit_t SELinux type can be entered
via the file_type, unla- beled_t, proc_type,
filesystem_type, mtrr_device_t, devicekit_exec_t,
sysctl_type file types.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the devicekit_t domain
are the follow- ing:</p>

<p>all files on the system, /dev/cpu/mtrr,
/usr/libexec/devkit-daemon</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux devicekit policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their devicekit processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
devicekit:</p>

<p>devicekit_power_t, devicekit_disk_t, devicekit_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a devicekit_t can be used to
make the pro- cess type devicekit_t permissive. SELinux does
not deny access to per- missive process types, but the AVC
(SELinux denials) messages are still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. devicekit policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run devicekit with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons the ability to
read/write terminals, you must turn on the
allow_daemons_use_tty boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tty 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their heap memory executable. Doing this is a really bad
idea. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could
indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in
bugzilla, you must turn on the allow_execheap boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execheap 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to map a
memory region as both executable and writable, this is
dangerous and the executable should be reported in
bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execmem boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmem 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all unconfined executables to use
libraries requiring text relocation that are not labeled
textrel_shlib_t), you must turn on the allow_execmod
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmod 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their stack exe- cutable. This should never, ever be
necessary. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but
could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported
in bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execstack boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow certain domains to map low memory
in the kernel, you must turn on the mmap_low_allowed
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1</p>

<p>If you want to boolean to determine whether the system
permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing
boolean values. Set this to true and you have to reboot to
set it back, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1</p>

<p>If you want to support X userspace object manager, you
must turn on the xserver_object_manager boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type devicekit_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux devicekit policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their devicekit processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the
devicekit, if you wanted to store files with these types in
a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to
sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put
the labels on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t devicekit_var_run_t
/srv/mydevicekit_con- tent(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/mydevicekit_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for devicekit:</p>

<p>devicekit_disk_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the devicekit_disk_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the devicekit_disk_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/libexec/udisks-daemon,
/usr/libexec/devkit-disks-daemon</p>

<p>devicekit_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the devicekit_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the devicekit_t domain.</p>

<p>devicekit_power_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the devicekit_power_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the devicekit_power_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/libexec/upowerd,
/usr/libexec/devkit-power-daemon</p>

<p>devicekit_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the devicekit_tmp_t type, if you want
to store devicekit temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>devicekit_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the devicekit_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the devicekit files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/upower(/.*)?, /var/lib/udisks(/.*)?,
/var/lib/DeviceKit-.*</p>

<p>devicekit_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the devicekit_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the devicekit files under the /run or /var/run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/devkit(/.*)?, /var/run/udisks(/.*)?,
/var/run/upower(/.*)?, /var/run/DeviceKit-disks(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
