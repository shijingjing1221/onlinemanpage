<p>NAME PAPI - Performance Application Programming
Interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The PAPI Performance Application Programming
Interface provides machine and operating system independent
access to hardware performance coun- ters found on most
modern processors. Any of over 100 preset events can be
counted through either a simple high level programming
interface or a more complete low level interface from either
C or Fortran. A list of the function calls in these
interfaces is given below, with references to other pages
for more complete details. For general information on the
Fortran interface see: PAPIF(3)</p>

<p>Component PAPI Beginning with version 3.9, PAPI supports
extensions to count perfor- mance information on multiple
simultaneous components. This capability is only provided in
the low level interface. New or modified function calls are
prefixed with an asterisk.</p>

<p>PAPI Presets An extensive list of predefined events is
implemented on all systems where they can be supported. For
a list of these events, see: PAPI_pre- sets(3)</p>

<p>PAPI Native Events PAPI also supports interface
functions for discovering the native events on a given
platform. For more information on native events, see:
PAPI_native(3)</p>

<p>High Level Functions A simple interface for
instrumenting end-user applications. Fully sup- ported on
both C and Fortran. See individual functions for details on
usage.</p>

<p>PAPI_num_counters(3) - get the number of hardware
counters available on the system PAPI_flips(3) - simplified
call to get Mflips/s (floating point instruction rate), real
and processor time PAPI_flops(3) - simplified call to get
Mflops/s (floating point operation rate), real and processor
time PAPI_ipc(3) - gets instructions per cycle, real and
processor time PAPI_accum_counters(3) - add current counts
to array and reset counters PAPI_read_counters(3) - copy
current counts to array and reset counters
PAPI_start_counters(3) - start counting hardware events
PAPI_stop_counters(3) - stop counters and return current
counts</p>

<p>Note that the high-level interface is self-initializing.
You can mix high and low level calls, but you must call
either PAPI_library_init(3)orahighlevelroutinebefore calling
a low level rou- tine.</p>

<p>Low Level Functions Advanced interface for all
applications and performance tools. Some functions may be
implemented only for C or Fortran. See individual functions
for details on usage and support.</p>
