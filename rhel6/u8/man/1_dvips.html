<p>NAME dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dvips [ options ] file[.dvi]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION THIS MAN PAGE IS OBSOLETE! See the Texinfo
documentation instead. You can read it either in Emacs or
with the standalone info program which comes with the GNU
texinfo distribution as prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu/tex-
info*.tar.gz.</p>

<p>The program dvips takes a DVI file file[.dvi] produced
by TeX (or by some other processor such as GFtoDVI) and
converts it to PostScript, normally sending the result
directly to the (laser)printer. The DVI file may be
specified without the .dvi extension. Fonts used may either
be resident in the printer or defined as bitmaps in PK
files, or a virtual combination of both. If the mktexpk
program is installed, dvips will automatically invoke
METAFONT to generate fonts that dont already exist.</p>

<p>For more information, see the Texinfo manual dvips.texi,
which should be installed somewhere on your system,
hopefully accessible through the standard Info tree.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Conserve memory by making three passes over
the .dvi file instead of two and only loading those
characters actually used. Generally only useful on machines
with a very limited amount of memory, like some PCs.</p>

<p>-A Print only odd pages (TeX pages, not sequence
pages).</p>

<p>-b num Generate num copies of each page, but duplicating
the page body rather than using the #numcopies option. This
can be useful in conjunction with a header file setting
bop-hook to do color separations or other neat tricks.</p>

<p>-B Print only even pages (TeX pages, not sequence
pages).</p>

<p>-c num Generate num copies of every page. Default is 1.
(For collated copies, see the -C option below.)</p>

<p>-C num Create num copies, but collated (by replicating
the data in the PostScript file). Slower than the -c option,
but easier on the hands, and faster than resubmitting the
same PostScript file multiple times.</p>

<p>-d num Set the debug flags. This is intended only for
emergencies or for unusual fact-finding expeditions; it will
work only if dvips has been compiled with the DEBUG option.
If nonzero, prints additional information on standard error.
The number is taken as a set of independent bits. The
meaning of each bit follows. 1=specials; 2=paths; 4=fonts;
8=pages; 16=headers; 32=font com- pression; 64=files;
128=memory; 256=Kpathsea stat(2) calls; 512=Kpathsea hash
table lookups; 1024=Kpathsea path element expansion;
2048=Kpathsea searches. To trace everything having to do
with file searching and opening, use 3650 (2048 + 1024 + 512
+ 64 + 2). To track all classes, you can use -1 (output is
extremely voluminous).</p>

<p>-D num Set the resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to num.
This affects the choice of bitmap fonts that are loaded and
also the positioning of letters in resident PostScript
fonts. Must be between 10 and 10000. This affects both the
horizontal and ver- tical resolution. If a high resolution
(something greater than 400 dpi, say) is selected, the -Z
flag should probably also be used.</p>

<p>-e num Make sure that each character is placed at most
this many pixels from its true resolution-independent
position on the page. The default value of this parameter is
resolution dependent. Allow- ing individual characters to
drift from their correctly rounded positions by a few
pixels, while regaining the true position at the beginning
of each new word, improves the spacing of letters in
words.</p>

<p>-E makes dvips attempt to generate an EPSF file with a
tight bound- ing box. This only works on one-page files, and
it only looks at marks made by characters and rules, not by
any included graphics. In addition, it gets the glyph
metrics from the tfm file, so characters that lie outside
their enclosing tfm box may confuse it. In addition, the
bounding box might be a bit too loose if the character glyph
has significant left or right side bearings. Nonetheless,
this option works well for creating small EPSF files for
equations or tables or the like. (Note, of course, that
dvips output is resolution dependent and thus does not make
very good EPSF files, especially if the images are to be
scaled; use these EPSF files with a great deal of care.)</p>

<p>-f Run as a filter. Read the .dvi file from standard
input and write the PostScript to standard output. The
standard input must be seekable, so it cannot be a pipe. If
you must use a pipe, write a shell script that copies the
pipe output to a tem- porary file and then points dvips at
this file. This option also disables the automatic reading
of the PRINTER environment variable, and turns off the
automatic sending of control D if it was turned on with the
-F option or in the configuration file; use -F after this
option if you want both.</p>

<p>-F Causes Control-D (ASCII code 4) to be appended as the
very last character of the PostScript file. This is useful
when dvips is driving the printer directly instead of
working through a spooler, as is common on extremely small
systems. NOTE! DO NOT USE THIS OPTION!</p>

<p>-G Causes dvips to shift non-printing characters to
higher-numbered positions. This may be useful sometimes.</p>

<p>-h name Prepend file name as an additional header file.
(However, if the name is simply - suppress all header files
from the output.) This header file gets added to the
PostScript userdict.</p>

<p>-i Make each section be a separate file. Under certain
circum- stances, dvips will split the document up into
sections to be processed independently; this is most often
done for memory rea- sons. Using this option tells dvips to
place each section into a separate file; the new file names
are created replacing the suffix of the supplied output file
name by a three-digit sequence number. This option is most
often used in conjunction with the -S option which sets the
maximum section length in pages. For instance, some
phototypesetters cannot print more than ten or so
consecutive pages before running out of steam; these options
can be used to automatically split a book into ten-page
sections, each to its own file.</p>

<p>-j Download only needed characters from Type 1 fonts.
This is the default in the current release. Some debugging
flags trace this operation. You can also control partial
downloading on a per- font basis, via the psfonts.map
file.</p>

<p>-k Print crop marks. This option increases the paper
size (which should be specified, either with a paper size
special or with the -T option) by a half inch in each
dimension. It translates each page by a quarter inch and
draws cross-style crop marks. It is mostly useful with
typesetters that can set the page size automatically.</p>

<p>-K This option causes comments in included PostScript
graphics, font files, and headers to be removed. This is
sometimes neces- sary to get around bugs in spoolers or
PostScript post-process- ing programs. Specifically, the
%%Page comments, when left in, often cause difficulties. Use
of this flag can cause some included graphics to fail, since
the PostScript header macros from some software packages
read portions of the input stream line by line, searching
for a particular comment. This option has been turned off by
default because PostScript previewers and spoolers have been
getting better.</p>

<p>-l num The last page printed will be the first one
numbered num Default is the last page in the document. If
the num is prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and any
argument to the -p option) is treated as a sequence number,
rather than a value to compare with count0 values. Thus,
using -l =9 will end with the ninth page of the document, no
matter what the pages are actually num- bered.</p>

<p>-m Specify manual feed for printer.</p>

<p>-mode mode Use mode as the Metafont device name for path
searching and font generation. This overrides any value from
configuration files. With the default paths, explicitly
specifying the mode also makes the program assume the fonts
are in a subdirectory named mode.</p>

<p>-M Turns off the automatic font generation facility. If
any fonts are missing, commands to generate the fonts are
appended to the file missfont.log in the current directory;
this file can then be executed and deleted to create the
missing fonts.</p>

<p>-n num At most num pages will be printed. Default is
100000.</p>

<p>-N Turns off structured comments; this might be
necessary on some systems that try to interpret PostScript
comments in weird ways, or on some PostScript printers. Old
versions of TranScript in particular cannot handle modern
Encapsulated PostScript.</p>

<p>-noomega This will disable the use of Omega extensions
when interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional
opcodes 129 and 134 are recognized by dvips as Omega
extensions and interpreted as requests to set 2-byte
characters. The only drawback is that the virtual font array
will (at least temporarily) require 65536 positions instead
of the default 256 positions, i.e. the memory requirements
of dvips will be slightly larger. If you find this
unacceptable or encounter another problem with the Omega
exten- sions, you can switch this extension off by using
-noomega (but please do send a bug report if you find such
problems - see the bug address in the AUTHORS section
below).</p>

<p>-o name The output will be sent to file name If no file
name is given (i.e., -o is last on the command line), the
default name is file.ps where the .dvi file was called
file.dvi; if this option isn t given, any default in the
configuration file is used. If the first character of the
supplied output file name is an exclamation mark, then the
remainder will be used as an argument to popen; thus,
specifying !lpr as the output file will automat- ically
queue the file for printing. This option also disables the
automatic reading of the PRINTER environment variable, and
turns off the automatic sending of control D if it was
turned on with the -F option or in the configuration file;
use -F after this option if you want both.</p>

<p>-O offset Move the origin by a certain amount. The
offset is a comma-sep- arated pair of dimensions, such as
.1in,-.3cm (in the same syn- tax used in the papersize
special). The origin of the page is shifted from the default
position (of one inch down, one inch to the right from the
upper left corner of the paper) by this amount.</p>

<p>-p num The first page printed will be the first one
numbered num. Default is the first page in the document. If
the num is pre- fixed by an equals sign, then it (and any
argument to the -l option) is treated as a sequence number,
rather than a value to compare with count0 values. Thus,
using -p =3 will start with the third page of the document,
no matter what the pages are actually numbered.</p>

<p>-pp pagelist A comma-separated list of pages and ranges
(a-b) may be given, which will be interpreted as count0
values. Pages not speci- fied will not be printed. Multiple
-pp options may be specified or all pages and page ranges
can be specified with one -pp option.</p>

<p>-P printername Sets up the output for the appropriate
printer. This is imple- mented by reading in
config.printername , which can then set the output pipe (as
in, !lpr -Pprintername as well as the font paths and any
other config.ps defaults for that printer only. Note that
config.ps is read before config.printername In addition,
another file called ~/.dvipsrc is searched for immediately
after config.ps; this file is intended for user defaults. If
no -P command is given, the environment variable PRINTER is
checked. If that variable exists, and a corresponding
configuration file exists, that configuration file is read
in.</p>

<p>-q Run in quiet mode. Dont chatter about pages
converted, etc.; report nothing but errors to standard
error.</p>

<p>-r Stack pages in reverse order. Normally, page 1 will
be printed first.</p>

<p>-R[0|1|2] Run securely. -R2 disables both shell command
execution in special{} (via backticks ) and config files
(via the E option), and opening of any absolute filenames.
-R1 , the default, forbids shell escapes but allows absolute
filenames. -R0 allows both. The config file option is z</p>

<p>-s Causes the entire global output to be enclosed in a
save/restore pair. This causes the file to not be truly
conformant, and is thus not recommended, but is useful if
you are driving the printer directly and dont care too much
about the portability of the output.</p>

<p>-S num Set the maximum number of pages in each section.
This option is most commonly used with the -i option; see
that documentation above for more information.</p>

<p>-t papertype This sets the paper type to papertype. The
papertype should be defined in one of the configuration
files, along with the appro- priate code to select it.
(Currently known types include let- ter, legal, ledger, a4,
a3). You can also specify -t landscape, which rotates a
document by 90 degrees. To rotate a document whose size is
not letter, you can use the -t option twice, once for the
page size, and once for landscape. You should not use any -t
option when the DVI file already contains a papersize
special, as is done by some LaTeX packages, notably hyper-
ref.sty.</p>

<p>The upper left corner of each page in the .dvi file is
placed one inch from the left and one inch from the top. Use
of this option is highly dependent on the configuration
file. Note that executing the letter or a4 or other
PostScript operators cause the document to be nonconforming
and can cause it not to print on certain printers, so the
paper size should not execute such an operator if at all
possible.</p>

<p>-T papersize Set the paper size to the given pair of
dimensions. This option takes its arguments in the same
style as -O. It overrides any paper size special in the dvi
file.</p>

<p>-u psmapfile Set psmapfile to be the file that dvips
uses for looking up PostScript font aliases. If psmapfile
begins with a + charac- ter, then the rest of the name is
used as the name of the map file, and the map file is
appended to the list of map files (instead of replacing the
list). In either case, if psmapfile has no extension, then
.map is added at the end.</p>

<p>-U Disable a PostScript virtual memory saving
optimization that stores the character metric information in
the same string that is used to store the bitmap
information. This is only necessary when driving the Xerox
4045 PostScript interpreter. It is caused by a bug in that
interpreter that results in garbage on the bottom of each
character. Not recommended unless you must drive this
printer.</p>

<p>-v Print the dvips version number and exit.</p>

<p>-V Download non-resident PostScript fonts as bitmaps.
This requires use of gsftopk or pstopk or some other such
pro- gram(s) in order to generate the required bitmap fonts;
these programs are supplied with dvips.</p>

<p>-x num Set the magnification ratio to num/1000.
Overrides the magnifi- cation specified in the .dvi file.
Must be between 10 and 100000. Instead of an integer, num
may be a real number for increased precision.</p>

<p>-X num Set the horizontal resolution in dots per inch to
num.</p>

<p>-y num Set the magnification ratio to num/1000 times the
magnification specified in the .dvi file. See -x above.</p>

<p>-Y num Set the vertical resolution in dots per inch to
num.</p>

<p>-z Pass html hyperdvi specials through to the output for
eventual distillation into PDF. This is not enabled by
default to avoid including the header files unnecessarily,
and use of temporary files in creating the output.</p>

<p>-Z Causes bitmapped fonts to be compressed before they
are down- loaded, thereby reducing the size of the
PostScript font- downloading information. Especially useful
at high resolutions or when very large fonts are used. Will
slow down printing somewhat, especially on early 68000-based
PostScript printers.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Dvipsk uses the same environment variables
and algorithms for finding font files as TeX and its friends
do. See the documentation for the Kpathsea library for
details. (Repeating it here is too cumbersome.)</p>

<p>KPATHSEA_DEBUG: Trace Kpathsea lookups; set to -1 for
complete tracing.</p>
