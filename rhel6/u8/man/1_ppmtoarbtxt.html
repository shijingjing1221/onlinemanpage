<p>NAME ppmtoarbtxt - generate image in arbitrary text
format from PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoarbtxt bodyskl [-hd headskl] [-tl tailskl]
[ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtoarbtxt generates simple text-based graphics formats
based on for- mat descriptions given as input. A text-based
graphics format is one in which an image is represented by
text (like PNM plain format, but unlike PNM raw format).</p>

<p>ppmtoarbtxt reads a PPM image as input. For each pixel
in the image, ppmtoarbtxt writes the contents of the
skeleton file bodyskl, with cer- tain substitutions based on
the value of the pixel, to stdout. The substitutions are as
follows:</p>

<p>#(ired format blackref whiteref) generates an integer in
the range blackref to whiteref using format representing the
red intensity of the pixel. A red intensity of 0 becomes
blackref; a red intensity of maxval becomes whiteref.</p>

<p>#(ired) is equivalent to #(ired %d 0 255).</p>

<p>#(igreen format blackref whiteref) Same as #(ired...,
but for green.</p>

<p>#(iblue format blackref whiteref) Same as #(ired..., but
for blue.</p>

<p>#(ilum format blackref whiteref) Same as #(ired..., but
representing the luminance value (0.299*red + 0.587*green +
0.114*blue) of the pixel.</p>

<p>#(fred format blackref whiteref) Same as #(ired..., but
generates a floating point number instead of an integer.</p>

<p>#(fred) is equivalent to #(fred %f 0.0 1.0).</p>

<p>#(fgreen format blackref whiteref) Same as #(fred...,
but for green.</p>

<p>#(fblue format blackref whiteref) Same as #(fred..., but
for blue.</p>

<p>#(flum format blackref whiteref) Same as #(fred..., but
representing the luminance value (0.299*red + 0.587*green +
0.114*blue) of the pixel.</p>

<p>#(width) Generates the width in pixels of the image.</p>

<p>#(height) Generates the height in pixels of the
image.</p>

<p>#(posx) Generates the horizontal position of the pixel,
in pixels from the left edge of the image.</p>

<p>#(posy) Generates the vertical position of the pixel, in
pixels from the top edge of the image.</p>

<p>If the skeleton file ends with a LF-character,
ppmtoarbtxt ignores it -- it does not include it in the
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -hd headskl This option causes ppmtoarbtxt to
place the contents of the file named headskl at the
beginning of the output, before the first pixel. It does the
same substitutions as for bodyskl, except substitutions
based on a pixel value are undefined.</p>

<p>-tl tailskl This option causes ppmtoarbtxt to place the
contents of the file named tailskl at the end of the output,
after the last pixel. It is analogous to -hd.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES gray inversion Here we generate a PGM
plain-format image with gray inversion (like ppmtopgm |
pnminvert).</p>

<p>Contents of our head skeleton file:</p>

<p>P2 #(width) #(height) 255</p>

<p>Contents of our body skeleton file:</p>

<p>#(ilum %d 255 0)</p>

<p>povray file Here we generate a povray file where each
pixel is represented by a sphere at location (x,y,z) =
(posx,height-posy,luminance). The color of the sphere is the
color of the pixel.</p>

<p>Contents of our head skeleton:</p>

<p>#include colors.inc #include textures.inc camera {
location &lt;#(width) * 0.6, #(height) * 0.7, 80&gt; look_at
&lt;#(width) * 0.5, #(height) * 0.5, 0&gt; }</p>

<p>light_source { &lt;#(width) * 0.5, #(height) * 0.5,
25&gt; color White }</p>

<p>Contents of our body skeleton:</p>

<p>sphere { &lt;#(posx),#(height)-#(posy),#(ilum %d 0
10)&gt;, 0.5 texture { pigment { color rgb
&lt;#(fred),#(fgreen),#(fblue)&gt; } finish { phong 1 } }
}</p>

<p>HISTORY ppmtoarbtxt was added to Netpbm in Release 10.14
(March 2003). It existed under the name ppmtotxt since
1995.</p>
