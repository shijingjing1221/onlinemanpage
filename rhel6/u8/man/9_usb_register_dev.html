USB_REGISTER_DEV(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_register_dev - register a USB device, and ask
for a minor number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_register_dev(struct usb_interface *
intf, struct usb_class_driver * class_driver);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS intf pointer to the usb_interface that is
being registered</p>

<p>class_driver pointer to the usb_class_driver for this
device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This should be called by all USB drivers
that use the USB major number. If CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS
is enabled, the minor number will be dynamically allocated
out of the list of available ones. If it is not enabled, the
minor number will be based on the next available free minor,
starting at the class_driver-&gt;minor_base.</p>

<p>This function also creates a usb class device in the
sysfs tree.</p>

<p>usb_deregister_dev must be called when the driver is
done with the minor numbers given out by this function.</p>

<p>Returns -EINVAL if something bad happens with trying to
register a device, and 0 on success.</p>
