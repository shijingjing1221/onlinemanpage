<p>vncserver(1) Virtual Network Computing vncserver(1)</p>

<p>NAME vncserver - start or stop a VNC server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vncserver [:display#] [-name desktop-name]
[-geometry widthxheight] [-depth depth] [-pixelformat
format] [-fp font-path] [-fg] [-autokill] [Xvnc-options...]
vncserver -kill :display#</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vncserver is used to start a VNC (Virtual
Network Computing) desktop. vncserver is a Perl script which
simplifies the process of starting an Xvnc server. It runs
Xvnc with appropriate options and starts a window manager on
the VNC desktop.</p>

<p>vncserver can be run with no options at all. In this
case it will choose the first available display number
(usually :1), start Xvnc with that display number, and start
the default window manager in the Xvnc session. You can also
specify the display number, in which case vnc- server will
attempt to start Xvnc with that display number and exit if
the display number is not available. For example:</p>

<p>vncserver :13</p>

<p>Editing the file $HOME/.vnc/xstartup allows you to
change the applica- tions run at startup (but note that this
will not affect an existing VNC session.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS You can get a list of options by passing -h as
an option to vncserver. In addition to the options listed
below, any unrecognised options will be passed to Xvnc - see
the Xvnc man page, or &quot;Xvnc -help&quot;, for
details.</p>

<p>-name desktop-name Each VNC desktop has a name which may
be displayed by the viewer. The desktop name defaults to
&quot;host:display# (username)&quot;, but you can change it
with this option. The desktop name option is passed to the
xstartup script via the $VNCDESKTOP environment variable,
which allows you to run a different set of applica- tions
depending on the name of the desktop.</p>

<p>-geometry widthxheight Specify the size of the VNC
desktop to be created. Default is 1024x768.</p>

<p>-depth depth Specify the pixel depth (in bits) of the
VNC desktop to be cre- ated. Default is 24. Other possible
values are 8, 15 and 16 - anything else is likely to cause
strange behaviour by applica- tions.</p>

<p>-pixelformat format Specify pixel format for Xvnc to use
(BGRnnn or RGBnnn). The default for depth 8 is BGR233
(meaning the most significant two bits represent blue, the
next three green, and the least signif- icant three
represent red), the default for depth 16 is RGB565, and the
default for depth 24 is RGB888.</p>

<p>-cc 3 As an alternative to the default TrueColor visual,
this allows you to run an Xvnc server with a PseudoColor
visual (i.e. one which uses a color map or palette), which
can be useful for run- ning some old X applications which
only work on such a display. Values other than 3
(PseudoColor) and 4 (TrueColor) for the -cc option may
result in strange behaviour, and PseudoColor desktops must
have an 8-bit depth.</p>

<p>-kill :display# This kills a VNC desktop previously
started with vncserver. It does this by killing the Xvnc
process, whose process ID is stored in the file
&quot;$HOME/.vnc/host:display#.pid&quot;. The -kill option
ignores anything preceding the first colon (&quot;:&quot;)
in the display argument. Thus, you can invoke
&quot;vncserver -kill $DIS- PLAY&quot;, for example at the
end of your xstartup file after a par- ticular application
exits.</p>

<p>-fp font-path If the vncserver script detects that the X
Font Server (XFS) is running, it will attempt to start Xvnc
and configure Xvnc to use XFS for font handling. Otherwise,
if XFS is not running, the vncserver script will attempt to
start Xvnc and allow Xvnc to use its own preferred method of
font handling (which may be a hard-coded font path or, on
more recent systems, a font cata- log.) In any case, if Xvnc
fails to start, the vncserver script will then attempt to
determine an appropriate X font path for this system and
start Xvnc using that font path.</p>

<p>The -fp argument allows you to override the above
fallback logic and specify a font path for Xvnc to use.</p>

<p>-fg Runs Xvnc as a foreground process. This has two
effects: (1) The VNC server can be aborted with CTRL-C, and
(2) the VNC server will exit as soon as the user logs out of
the window man- ager in the VNC session. This may be
necessary when launching TigerVNC from within certain grid
computing environments.</p>

<p>-autokill Automatically kill Xvnc whenever the xstartup
script exits. In most cases, this has the effect of
terminating Xvnc when the user logs out of the window
manager.</p>

<p>FILES Several VNC-related files are found in the
directory $HOME/.vnc:</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/xstartup A shell script specifying X
applications to be run when a VNC desktop is started. If
this file does not exist, then vncserver will create a
default xstartup script which attempts to launch your chosen
window manager.</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/passwd The VNC password file.</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/host:display#.log The log file for Xvnc and
applications started in xstartup.</p>

<p>$HOME/.vnc/host:display#.pid Identifies the Xvnc process
ID, used by the -kill option.</p>
