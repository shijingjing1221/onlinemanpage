<p>USERADD(8) System Management Commands USERADD(8)</p>

<p>NAME useradd - create a new user or update default new
user information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS useradd [options] LOGIN</p>

<p>useradd -D</p>

<p>useradd -D [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When invoked without the -D option, the
useradd command creates a new user account using the values
specified on the command line plus the default values from
the system. Depending on command line options, the useradd
command will update system files and may also create the new
user&acute;s home directory and copy initial files.</p>

<p>By default, a group will also be created for the new
user (see -g, -N, -U, and USERGROUPS_ENAB).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options which apply to the useradd command
are:</p>

<p>-b, --base-dir BASE_DIR The default base directory for
the system if -d HOME_DIR is not specified. BASE_DIR is
concatenated with the account name to define the home
directory. The BASE_DIR must exist otherwise the home
directory cannot be created.</p>

<p>If this option is not specified, useradd will use the
base directory specified by the HOME variable in
/etc/default/useradd, or /home by default.</p>

<p>-c, --comment COMMENT Any text string. It is generally a
short description of the login, and is currently used as the
field for the user&acute;s full name.</p>

<p>-d, --home-dir HOME_DIR The new user will be created
using HOME_DIR as the value for the user&acute;s login
directory. The default is to append the LOGIN name to
BASE_DIR and use that as the login directory name.</p>

<p>-D, --defaults See below, the subsection &quot;Changing
the default values&quot;.</p>

<p>-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE The date on which the user
account will be disabled. The date is specified in the
format YYYY-MM-DD.</p>

<p>If not specified, useradd will use the default expiry
date specified by the EXPIRE variable in
/etc/default/useradd, or an empty string (no expiry) by
default.</p>

<p>-f, --inactive INACTIVE The number of days after a
password expires until the account is permanently disabled.
A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the password
has expired, and a value of -1 disables the feature.</p>

<p>If not specified, useradd will use the default
inactivity period specified by the INACTIVE variable in
/etc/default/useradd, or -1 by default.</p>

<p>-g, --gid GROUP The group name or number of the
user&acute;s initial login group. The group name must exist.
A group number must refer to an already existing group.</p>

<p>If not specified, the behavior of useradd will depend on
the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs. If this
variable is set to yes (or -U/--user-group is specified on
the command line), a group will be created for the user,
with the same name as her loginname. If the variable is set
to no (or -N/--no-user-group is specified on the command
line), useradd will set the primary group of the new user to
the value specified by the GROUP variable in
/etc/default/useradd, or 100 by default.</p>

<p>-G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]] A list of
supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no
intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same
restrictions as the group given with the -g option. The
default is for the user to belong only to the initial
group.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>-k, --skel SKEL_DIR The skeleton directory, which
contains files and directories to be copied in the
user&acute;s home directory, when the home directory is
created by useradd.</p>

<p>This option is only valid if the -m (or --create-home)
option is specified.</p>

<p>If this option is not set, the skeleton directory is
defined by the SKEL variable in /etc/default/useradd or, by
default, /etc/skel.</p>

<p>If possible, the ACLs and extended attributes are
copied.</p>

<p>-K, --key KEY=VALUE Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults
(UID_MIN, UID_MAX, UMASK, PASS_MAX_DAYS and others).</p>

<p>Example: -K PASS_MAX_DAYS=-1 can be used when creating
system account to turn off password ageing, even though
system account has no password at all. Multiple -K options
can be specified, e.g.: -K UID_MIN=100 -K UID_MAX=499</p>

<p>-l, --no-log-init Do not add the user to the lastlog and
faillog databases.</p>

<p>By default, the user&acute;s entries in the lastlog and
faillog databases are resetted to avoid reusing the entry
from a previously deleted user.</p>

<p>-m, --create-home Create the user&acute;s home directory
if it does not exist. The files and directories contained in
the skeleton directory (which can be defined with the -k
option) will be copied to the home directory.</p>

<p>By default, if this option is not specified and
CREATE_HOME is not enabled, no home directories are
created.</p>

<p>The directory where the user&acute;s home directory is
created must exist and have proper SELinux context and
permissions. Otherwise the user&acute;s home directory
cannot be created or accessed.</p>

<p>-M, --no-create-home Do not create the user&acute;s home
directory, even if the system wide setting from
/etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME) is set to yes.</p>

<p>-N, --no-user-group Do not create a group with the same
name as the user, but add the user to the group specified by
the -g option or by the GROUP variable in
/etc/default/useradd.</p>

<p>The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are
not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in
/etc/login.defs.</p>

<p>-o, --non-unique Allow the creation of a user account
with a duplicate (non-unique) UID.</p>

<p>This option is only valid in combination with the -u
option.</p>

<p>-p, --password PASSWORD The encrypted password, as
returned by crypt(3). The default is to disable the
password.</p>

<p>Note: This option is not recommended because the
password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users
listing the processes.</p>

<p>You should make sure the password respects the
system&acute;s password policy.</p>

<p>-r, --system Create a system account.</p>

<p>System users will be created with no aging information
in /etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are chosen in
the SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in
/etc/login.defs, instead of UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID
counterparts for the creation of groups).</p>

<p>Note that useradd will not create a home directory for
such an user, regardless of the default setting in
/etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME). You have to specify the -m
options if you want a home directory for a system account to
be created.</p>

<p>-R, --root CHROOT_DIR Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR
directory and use the configuration files from the
CHROOT_DIR directory.</p>

<p>-s, --shell SHELL The name of the user&acute;s login
shell. The default is to leave this field blank, which
causes the system to select the default login shell
specified by the SHELL variable in /etc/default/useradd, or
an empty string by default.</p>

<p>-u, --uid UID The numerical value of the user&acute;s
ID. This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.
The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the
smallest ID value greater than or equal to UID_MIN and
greater than every other user.</p>

<p>See also the -r option and the UID_MAX description.</p>

<p>-U, --user-group Create a group with the same name as
the user, and add the user to this group.</p>

<p>The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are
not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in
/etc/login.defs.</p>

<p>-Z, --selinux-user SEUSER The SELinux user for the
user&acute;s login. The default is to leave this field
blank, which causes the system to select the default SELinux
user.</p>

<p>Changing the default values When invoked with only the
-D option, useradd will display the current default values.
When invoked with -D plus other options, useradd will update
the default values for the specified options. Valid
default-changing options are:</p>

<p>-b, --base-dir BASE_DIR The path prefix for a new
user&acute;s home directory. The user&acute;s name will be
affixed to the end of BASE_DIR to form the new user&acute;s
home directory name, if the -d option is not used when
creating a new account.</p>

<p>This option sets the HOME variable in
/etc/default/useradd.</p>

<p>-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE The date on which the user
account is disabled.</p>

<p>This option sets the EXPIRE variable in
/etc/default/useradd.</p>

<p>-f, --inactive INACTIVE The number of days after a
password has expired before the account will be
disabled.</p>

<p>This option sets the INACTIVE variable in
/etc/default/useradd.</p>

<p>-g, --gid GROUP The group name or ID for a new
user&acute;s initial group (when the -N/--no-user-group is
used or when the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable is set to no in
/etc/login.defs). The named group must exist, and a
numerical group ID must have an existing entry.</p>

<p>This option sets the GROUP variable in
/etc/default/useradd.</p>

<p>-s, --shell SHELL The name of a new user&acute;s login
shell.</p>

<p>This option sets the SHELL variable in
/etc/default/useradd.</p>

<p>NOTES The system administrator is responsible for
placing the default user files in the /etc/skel/ directory
(or any other skeleton directory specified in
/etc/default/useradd or on the command line).</p>

<p>CAVEATS You may not add a user to a NIS or LDAP group.
This must be performed on the corresponding server.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the username already exists in an external
user database such as NIS or LDAP, useradd will deny the
user account creation request.</p>

<p>Usernames may only be up to 32 characters long.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The following configuration variables in
/etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:</p>

<p>CREATE_HOME (boolean) Indicate if a home directory
should be created by default for new users.</p>

<p>This setting does not apply to system users, and can be
overridden on the command line.</p>

<p>GID_MAX (number), GID_MIN (number) Range of group IDs
used for the creation of regular groups by useradd,
groupadd, or newusers.</p>

<p>The default value for GID_MIN (resp. GID_MAX) is 500
(resp. 60000).</p>

<p>MAIL_DIR (string) The mail spool directory. This is
needed to manipulate the mailbox when its corresponding user
account is modified or deleted. If not specified, a
compile-time default is used.</p>

<p>MAIL_FILE (string) Defines the location of the users
mail spool files relatively to their home directory.</p>

<p>The MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE variables are used by
useradd, usermod, and userdel to create, move, or delete the
user&acute;s mail spool.</p>

<p>If MAIL_CHECK_ENAB is set to yes, they are also used to
define the MAIL environment variable.</p>

<p>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number) Maximum members per group
entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line)
is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password,
and same GID).</p>

<p>The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits
in the number of members in a group.</p>

<p>This feature (split group) permits to limit the length
of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024
characters.</p>

<p>If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.</p>

<p>Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools
(even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this
variable unless you really need it.</p>

<p>PASS_MAX_DAYS (number) The maximum number of days a
password may be used. If the password is older than this, a
password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be
assumed (which disables the restriction).</p>

<p>PASS_MIN_DAYS (number) The minimum number of days
allowed between password changes. Any password changes
attempted sooner than this will be rejected. If not
specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the
restriction).</p>

<p>PASS_WARN_AGE (number) The number of days warning given
before a password expires. A zero means warning is given
only upon the day of expiration, a negative value means no
warning is given. If not specified, no warning will be
provided.</p>

<p>SYS_GID_MAX (number), SYS_GID_MIN (number) Range of
group IDs used for the creation of system groups by useradd,
groupadd, or newusers.</p>

<p>The default value for SYS_GID_MIN (resp. SYS_GID_MAX) is
201 (resp. GID_MIN-1).</p>

<p>SYS_UID_MAX (number), SYS_UID_MIN (number) Range of user
IDs used for the creation of system users by useradd or
newusers.</p>

<p>The default value for SYS_UID_MIN (resp. SYS_UID_MAX) is
201 (resp. UID_MIN-1).</p>

<p>UID_MAX (number), UID_MIN (number) Range of user IDs
used for the creation of regular users by useradd or
newusers.</p>

<p>The default value for UID_MIN (resp. UID_MAX) is 500
(resp. 60000).</p>

<p>UMASK (number) The file mode creation mask is
initialized to this value. If not specified, the mask will
be initialized to 022.</p>

<p>useradd and newusers use this mask to set the mode of
the home directory they create</p>

<p>It is also used by login to define users&acute; initial
umask. Note that this mask can be overridden by the
user&acute;s GECOS line (if QUOTAS_ENAB is set) or by the
specification of a limit with the K identifier in
limits(5).</p>

<p>USERGROUPS_ENAB (boolean) Enable setting of the umask
group bits to be the same as owner bits (examples: 022 -&gt;
002, 077 -&gt; 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the
same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group
name.</p>

<p>If set to yes, userdel will remove the user&acute;s
group if it contains no more members, and useradd will
create by default a group with the name of the user.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd User account information.</p>

<p>/etc/shadow Secure user account information.</p>

<p>/etc/group Group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/gshadow Secure group account information.</p>

<p>/etc/default/useradd Default values for account
creation.</p>

<p>/etc/skel/ Directory containing default files.</p>

<p>/etc/login.defs Shadow password suite configuration.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The useradd command exits with the following
values:</p>

<p>0 success</p>

<p>1 can&acute;t update password file</p>

<p>2 invalid command syntax</p>

<p>3 invalid argument to option</p>

<p>4 UID already in use (and no -o)</p>

<p>6 specified group doesn&acute;t exist</p>

<p>9 username already in use</p>

<p>10 can&acute;t update group file</p>

<p>12 can&acute;t create home directory</p>

<p>14 can&acute;t update SELinux user mapping</p>
