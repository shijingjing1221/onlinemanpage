<p>ATEXIT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual ATEXIT(3)</p>

<p>NAME atexit - register a function to be called at normal
process termination</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int atexit(void (*function)(void));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The atexit() function registers the given
function to be called at nor- mal process termination,
either via exit(3) or via return from the pro- gram s
main(). Functions so registered are called in the reverse
order of their registration; no arguments are passed.</p>

<p>The same function may be registered multiple times: it
is called once for each registration.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 requires that an implementation allow at
least ATEXIT_MAX (32) such functions to be registered. The
actual limit supported by an implementation can be obtained
using sysconf(3).</p>

<p>When a child process is created via fork(2), it inherits
copies of its parents registrations. Upon a successful call
to one of the exec(3) functions, all registrations are
removed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The atexit() function returns the value 0
if successful; otherwise it returns a non-zero value.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Functions registered using atexit() (and
on_exit(3)) are not called if a process terminates
abnormally because of the delivery of a signal.</p>

<p>If one of the functions registered functions calls
_exit(2), then any remaining functions are not invoked, and
the other process termination steps performed by exit(3) are
not performed.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 says that the result of calling exit(3)
more than once (i.e., calling exit(3) within a function
registered using atexit(3)) is undefined. On some systems
(but not Linux), this can result in an infinite recursion;
portable programs should not invoke exit(3) inside a
function registered using atexit(3).</p>

<p>The atexit() and on_exit(3) functions register functions
on the same list: at normal process termination, the
registered functions are invoked in reverse order of their
registration by these two functions.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 says that the result is undefined if
longjmp(3) is used to terminate execution of one of the
functions registered atexit().</p>

<p>Linux Notes Since glibc 2.2.3, atexit() (and on_exit(3))
can be used within a shared library to establish functions
that are called when the shared library is unloaded.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void bye(void) { printf(&quot;That was all, folks0);
}</p>

<p>int main(void) { long a; int i;</p>

<p>a = sysconf(_SC_ATEXIT_MAX); printf(&quot;ATEXIT_MAX =
%ld0, a);</p>

<p>i = atexit(bye); if (i != 0) { fprintf(stderr,
&quot;cannot set exit function0); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>

<p>SEE ALSO _exit(2), exit(3), on_exit(3)</p>
