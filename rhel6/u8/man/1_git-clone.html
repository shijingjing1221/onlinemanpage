<p>NAME git-clone - Clone a repository into a new
directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git clone
[--template=&lt;template_directory&gt;] [-l] [-s]
[--no-hardlinks] [-q] [-n] [--bare] [--mirror] [-o
&lt;name&gt;] [-b &lt;name&gt;] [-u &lt;upload-pack&gt;]
[--reference &lt;repository&gt;] [--depth &lt;depth&gt;]
[--recursive] [--] &lt;repository&gt;
[&lt;directory&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Clones a repository into a newly created
directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch
in the cloned repository (visible using git branch -r), and
creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from
the cloned repository s currently active branch.</p>

<p>After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments
will update all the remote-tracking branches, and a git pull
without arguments will in addition merge the remote master
branch into the current master branch, if any.</p>

<p>This default configuration is achieved by creating
references to the remote branch heads under
refs/remotes/origin and by initializing remote.origin.url
and remote.origin.fetch configuration variables.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --local, -l When the repository to clone from is
on a local machine, this flag bypasses the normal &quot;git
aware&quot; transport mechanism and clones the repository by
making a copy of HEAD and everything under objects and refs
directories. The files under .git/objects/ directory are
hardlinked to save space when possible. This is now the
default when the source repository is specified with
/path/to/repo syntax, so it essentially is a no-op option.
To force copying instead of hardlinking (which may be
desirable if you are trying to make a back-up of your
repository), but still avoid the usual &quot;git aware&quot;
transport mechanism, --no-hardlinks can be used.</p>

<p>--no-hardlinks Optimize the cloning process from a
repository on a local filesystem by copying files under
.git/objects directory.</p>

<p>--shared, -s When the repository to clone is on the
local machine, instead of using hard links, automatically
setup .git/objects/info/alternates to share the objects with
the source repository. The resulting repository starts out
without any object of its own.</p>

<p>NOTE: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do not use
it unless you understand what it does. If you clone your
repository using this option and then delete branches (or
use any other git command that makes any existing commit
unreferenced) in the source repository, some objects may
become unreferenced (or dangling). These objects may be
removed by normal git operations (such as git commit) which
automatically call git gc --auto. (See git-gc(1).) If these
objects are removed and were referenced by the cloned
repository, then the cloned repository will become
corrupt.</p>

<p>Note that running git repack without the -l option in a
repository cloned with -s will copy objects from the source
repository into a pack in the cloned repository, removing
the disk space savings of clone -s. It is safe, however, to
run git gc, which uses the -l option by default.</p>

<p>If you want to break the dependency of a repository
cloned with -s on its source repository, you can simply run
git repack -a to copy all objects from the source repository
into a pack in the cloned repository.</p>

<p>--reference &lt;repository&gt; If the reference
repository is on the local machine, automatically setup
.git/objects/info/alternates to obtain objects from the
reference repository. Using an already existing repository
as an alternate will require fewer objects to be copied from
the repository being cloned, reducing network and local
storage costs.</p>

<p>NOTE: see the NOTE for the --shared option.</p>

<p>--quiet, -q Operate quietly. Progress is not reported to
the standard error stream. This flag is also passed to the
rsync command when given.</p>

<p>--verbose, -v Run verbosely. Does not affect the
reporting of progress status to the standard error
stream.</p>

<p>--progress Progress status is reported on the standard
error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal,
unless -q is specified. This flag forces progress status
even if the standard error stream is not directed to a
terminal.</p>

<p>--no-checkout, -n No checkout of HEAD is performed after
the clone is complete.</p>

<p>--bare Make a bare GIT repository. That is, instead of
creating &lt;directory&gt; and placing the administrative
files in &lt;directory&gt;/.git, make the &lt;directory&gt;
itself the $GIT_DIR. This obviously implies the -n because
there is nowhere to check out the working tree. Also the
branch heads at the remote are copied directly to
corresponding local branch heads, without mapping them to
refs/remotes/origin/. When this option is used, neither
remote-tracking branches nor the related configuration
variables are created.</p>

<p>--mirror Set up a mirror of the remote repository. This
implies --bare.</p>

<p>--origin &lt;name&gt;, -o &lt;name&gt; Instead of using
the remote name origin to keep track of the upstream
repository, use &lt;name&gt;.</p>

<p>--branch &lt;name&gt;, -b &lt;name&gt; Instead of
pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed to by
the cloned repositorys HEAD, point to &lt;name&gt; branch
instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that
will be checked out.</p>

<p>--upload-pack &lt;upload-pack&gt;, -u
&lt;upload-pack&gt; When given, and the repository to clone
from is accessed via ssh, this specifies a non-default path
for the command run on the other end.</p>

<p>--template=&lt;template_directory&gt; Specify the
directory from which templates will be used; (See the
&quot;TEMPLATE DIRECTORY&quot; section of git-init(1).)</p>

<p>--depth &lt;depth&gt; Create a shallow clone with a
history truncated to the specified number of revisions. A
shallow repository has a number of limitations (you cannot
clone or fetch from it, nor push from nor into it), but is
adequate if you are only interested in the recent history of
a large project with a long history, and would want to send
in fixes as patches.</p>

<p>--recursive After the clone is created, initialize all
submodules within, using their default settings. This is
equivalent to running git submodule update --init
--recursive immediately after the clone is finished. This
option is ignored if the cloned repository does not have a
worktree/checkout (i.e. if any of --no-checkout/-n, --bare,
or --mirror is given)</p>

<p>&lt;repository&gt; The (possibly remote) repository to
clone from. See the URLS section below for more information
on specifying repositories.</p>

<p>&lt;directory&gt; The name of a new directory to clone
into. The &quot;humanish&quot; part of the source repository
is used if no directory is explicitly given (repo for
/path/to/repo.git and foo for host.xz:foo/.git). Cloning
into an existing directory is only allowed if the directory
is empty.</p>

<p>GIT URLS In general, URLs contain information about the
transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and
the path to the repository. Depending on the transport
protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>

<p>Git natively supports ssh, git, http, https, ftp, ftps,
and rsync protocols. The following syntaxes may be used with
them:</p>

<p>&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the
ssh protocol:</p>

<p>&middot; [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username
expansion:</p>

<p>&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot;
git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>For local respositories, also supported by git natively,
the following syntaxes may be used:</p>

<p>&middot; /path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; file:///path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except the
former implies --local option.</p>

<p>When git doesnt know how to handle a certain transport
protocol, it attempts to use the remote-&lt;transport&gt;
remote helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote
helper, the following syntax may be used:</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path,
or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific
remote helper being invoked. See git-remote-helpers(1) for
details.</p>

<p>If there are a large number of similarly-named remote
repositories and you want to use a different format for them
(such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that
work), you can create a configuration section of the
form:</p>

<p>[url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] insteadOf =
&lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p>For example, with this:</p>

<p>[url &quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;] insteadOf =
host.xz:/path/to/ insteadOf = work:</p>

<p>a URL like &quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
&quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in
any context that takes a URL to be
&quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can
create a configuration section of the form:</p>

<p>[url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] pushInsteadOf
= &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p>For example, with this:</p>

<p>[url &quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;] pushInsteadOf =
git://example.org/</p>

<p>a URL like
&quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot;
for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES &middot; Clone from upstream:</p>

<p>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/.../linux-2.6
my2.6 $ cd my2.6 $ make</p>

<p>&middot; Make a local clone that borrows from the
current directory, without checking things out:</p>

<p>$ git clone -l -s -n . ../copy $ cd ../copy $ git
show-branch</p>

<p>&middot; Clone from upstream while borrowing from an
existing local directory:</p>

<p>$ git clone --reference my2.6
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/.../linux-2.7 my2.7 $ cd
my2.7</p>

<p>&middot; Create a bare repository to publish your
changes to the public:</p>

<p>$ git clone --bare -l /home/proj/.git
/pub/scm/proj.git</p>

<p>&middot; Create a repository on the kernel.org machine
that borrows from Linus:</p>

<p>$ git clone --bare -l -s
/pub/scm/.../torvalds/linux-2.6.git
/pub/scm/.../me/subsys-2.6.git</p>
