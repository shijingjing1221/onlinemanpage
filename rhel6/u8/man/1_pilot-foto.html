<p>PROBLEMS Palm has not published their database format
for the thumbnails. So, pilot-foto puts a generic penguin
thumbnail for every image uploaded. Fotos can be accessed by
a named list on the handheld as well as the thumbnails. This
has been tried on a couple of handhelds. It is possi- ble
that a foreign palm or different model will not like it.</p>

<p>To get a thumbnail image you can copy the jpegs to the
memory card. If you copy them back to the handheld they will
have a new thumbnail that matches the jpeg.</p>

Williams &lt;linux@code- help.co.uk&gt;</p>

<p>BUGS If a jpeg is installed with the same name as one
already on the palm you will have 2 thumbnails pointing to
the same jpeg. The new jpeg will overwrite the old jpeg.</p>

<p>If the thumbnail fails to install then the jpeg should
be removed. It is not.</p>

<p>We have an online bug tracker. Using this is the only
way to ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can
track them until they are resolved or closed. Reporting bugs
via email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of
accountability. Please point your browser to

report your bugs and issues there.</p>
