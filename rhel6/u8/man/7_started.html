<p>NAME started - event signalling that a job is
running</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS started JOB=JOB INSTANCE=INSTANCE [ENV]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The started event is generated by the
Upstart init(8) daemon when an instance of a job has
finished starting and is now running. The JOB environment
variable contains the job name, and the INSTANCE environ-
ment variable contains the instance name which will be empty
for sin- gle-instance jobs.</p>

<p>init(8) emits this event as an informational signal,
services and tasks started or stopped by this event will do
so in parallel with other activity. It is typically combined
with the stopping(7) event by ser- vices declaring a
dependency.</p>

<p>Job configuration files may use the export stanza to
export environment variables from their own environment into
the started event. See init(5) for more details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A service that wishes to depend on another
service might use:</p>

<p>start on started apache stop on stopping apache</p>

<p>A task that must be run after another task or service
has been started might use:</p>

<p>start on started postgresql</p>
