<p>NAME Compose - X client mappings for multi-key input
sequences</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The X library, libX11, provides a simple
input method for characters beyond those represented on
typical keyboards using sequences of key strokes that are
combined to enter a single character.</p>

<p>The compose file is searched for in the following
order:</p>

<p>- If the environment variable $XCOMPOSEFILE is set, its
value is used as the name of the Compose file.</p>

<p>- If the user s home directory has a file named
.XCompose, it is used as the Compose file.</p>

<p>- The system provided compose file is used by mapping
the locale to a compose file from the list in
/usr/share/X11/locale/com- pose.dir.</p>

<p>Compose files can use an &quot;include&quot;
instruction. This allows local mod- ifications to be made to
existing compose files without including all of the content
directly. For example, the system s iso8859-1 compose file
can be included with a line like this: include
&quot;%S/iso8859-1/Compose&quot;</p>

<p>There are several substitutions that can be made in the
file name of the include instruction:</p>

<p>%H expands to the user s home directory (the $HOME
environment vari- able)</p>

<p>%L expands to the name of the locale specific Compose
file (i.e.,
&quot;/usr/share/X11/locale/&lt;localename&gt;/Compose&quot;)</p>

<p>%S expands to the name of the system directory for
Compose files (i.e., &quot;/usr/share/X11/locale&quot;)</p>

<p>For example, you can include in your compose file the
default Compose file by using: include &quot;%L&quot; and
then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change. New
com- pose rules can be added, and previous ones
replaced.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT Compose files are plain text files, with a
separate line for each com- pose sequence. Comments begin
with # characters. Each compose sequence specifies one or
more events and a resulting input sequence, with an optional
comment at the end of the line: EVENT [EVENT...] : RESULT [#
COMMENT]</p>

<p>Each event consists of a specified input keysym, and
optional modifier states: [([!] ([~] MODIFIER)...) | None]
&lt;keysym&gt;</p>

<p>If the modifier list is preceded by &quot;!&quot; it
must match exactly. MODI- FIER may be one of Ctrl, Lock,
Caps, Shift, Alt or Meta. Each modifier may be preceded by a
&quot;~&quot; character to indicate that the modifier must
not be present. If &quot;None&quot; is specified, no
modifier may be present.</p>

<p>The result specifies a string, keysym, or both, that the
X client receives as input when the sequence of events is
input: &quot;STRING&quot; | keysym | &quot;STRING&quot;
keysym</p>

<p>Keysyms are specified without the XK_ prefix.</p>

<p>Strings may be direct text encoded in the locale for
which the compose file is to be used, or an escaped octal or
hexadecimal character code. Octal codes are specified as
123&quot; and hexadecimal codes as 0x123a&quot;. It is not
necessary to specify in the right part of a rule a locale
encoded string in addition to the keysym name. If the string
is omit- ted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according
to the current locale. I.e., if a rule looks like:
&lt;dead_grave&gt; &lt;A&gt; : 300&quot; Agrave the result
of the composition is always the letter with the
&quot;300&quot; code. But if the rule is: &lt;dead_grave&gt;
&lt;A&gt; : Agrave the result depends on how Agrave is
mapped in the current locale.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT XCOMPOSEFILE File to use for compose
sequences.</p>

<p>XCOMPOSECACHE Directory to use for caching compiled
compose files.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.XCompose User default compose file if
XCOMPOSEFILE is not set.</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/locale/compose.dir File listing the
compose file path to use for each locale.</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/locale/&lt;localemapping&gt;/Compose
System default compose file for the locale, mapped via com-
pose.dir.</p>

<p>/var/cache/libx11/compose/ System-wide cache directory
for compiled compose files.</p>

<p>$HOME/.compose-cache/ Per-user cache directory for
compiled compose files.</p>
