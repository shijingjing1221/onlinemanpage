<p>NAME pkcsslotd - shared memory manager for
opencryptoki</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pkcsslotd daemon manages PKCS#11 objects
between PKCS#11-enabled applications. When 2 or more
processes are accessing the same crypto- graphic token, the
daemon is notified and updates each application when the
tokens objects change.</p>

<p>NOTES Only one instance of the pkcsslotd daemon should
be running on any given host. If a prior instance of
pkcsslotd did not shut down cleanly, then it may leave an
allocated shared memory segment on the system. The allocated
memory segment can be identified by its key and can be
safely removed once the daemon is stopped with the ipcrm
command, such as:</p>

<p>ipcrm -M 0x6202AB38</p>

<p>The daemon creates the shared memory segment with group
ownership by the pkcs11 group. All non-root users that
should be able to use open- Cryptoki need to be members of
the group. Only trusted users should be assigned to the
group, see the &quot;SECURITY NOTE&quot; in the
opencryptoki(7) manual page for details.</p>
