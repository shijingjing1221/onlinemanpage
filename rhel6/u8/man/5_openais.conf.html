<p>OPENAIS_CONF(5) Openais Programmer s Manual
OPENAIS_CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME openais.conf - openais executive configuration
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/ais/openais.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The openais.conf instructs the openais
executive about various parame- ters needed to control the
openais executive. The configuration file consists of
bracketed top level directives. The possible directive
choices are totem { } , logging { } , event { } , and amf {
}. These directives are described below.</p>

<p>totem { } This top level directive contains
configuration options for the totem protocol.</p>

<p>logging { } This top level directive contains
configuration options for log- ging.</p>

<p>event { } This top level directive contains
configuration options for the event service.</p>

<p>amf { } This top level directive contains configuration
options for the AMF service.</p>

<p>Within the totem directive, an interface directive is
required. There is also one configuration option which is
required:</p>

<p>Within the interface sub-directive of totem there are
four parameters which are required:</p>

<p>ringnumber This specifies the ring number for the
interface. When using the redundant ring protocol, each
interface should specify sepa- rate ring numbers to uniquely
identify to the membership proto- col which interface to use
for which redundant ring.</p>

<p>bindnetaddr This specifies the address which the openais
executive should bind. This address should always end in
zero. If the totem traffic should be routed over
192.168.5.92, set bindnetaddr to 192.168.5.0.</p>

<p>This may also be an IPV6 address, in which case IPV6
networking will be used. In this case, the full address must
be specified and there is no automatic selection of the
network interface within a specific subnet as with IPv4.</p>

<p>If IPv6 networking is used, the nodeid field must be
specified.</p>

<p>mcastaddr This is the multicast address used by openais
executive. The default should work for most networks, but
the network adminis- trator should be queried about a
multicast address to use. Avoid 224.x.x.x because this is a
&quot;config&quot; multicast address.</p>

<p>This may also be an IPV6 multicast address, in which
case IPV6 networking will be used. If IPv6 networking is
used, the nodeid field must be specified.</p>

<p>mcastport This specifies the UDP port number. It is
possible to use the same multicast address on a network with
the openais services configured for different UDP ports.</p>

<p>Within the totem directive, there are seven
configuration options of which one is required, five are
optional, and one is required when IPV6 is configured in the
interface subdirective. The required directive controls the
version of the totem configuration. The optional option
unless using IPV6 directive controls identification of the
processor. The optional options control secrecy and
authentication, the redundant ring mode of operation,
maximum network MTU, and number of sending threads, and the
nodeid field.</p>

<p>version This specifies the version of the configuration
file. Currently the only valid version for this directive is
2.</p>

<p>nodeid This configuration option is optional when using
IPv4 and required when using IPv6. This is a 32 bit value
specifying the node identifier delivered to the cluster
membership service. If this is not specified with IPv4, the
node id will be determined from the 32 bit IP address the
system to which the system is bound with ring identifier of
0. The node identifier value of zero is reserved and should
not be used.</p>

<p>secauth This specifies that HMAC/SHA1 authentication
should be used to authenticate all messages. It further
specifies that all data should be encrypted with the
sober128 encryption algorithm to protect data from
eavesdropping.</p>

<p>Enabling this option adds a 36 byte header to every
message sent by totem which reduces total throughput.
Encryption and authen- tication consume 75% of CPU cycles in
aisexec as measured with gprof when enabled.</p>

<p>For 100mbit networks with 1500 MTU frame transmissions:
A throughput of 9mb/sec is possible with 100% cpu
utilization when this option is enabled on 3ghz cpus. A
throughput of 10mb/sec is possible wth 20% cpu utilization
when this optin is disabled on 3ghz cpus.</p>

<p>For gig-e networks with large frame transmissions: A
throughput of 20mb/sec is possible when this option is
enabled on 3ghz cpus. A throughput of 60mb/sec is possible
when this option is disabled on 3ghz cpus.</p>

<p>The default is on.</p>

<p>rrp_mode This specifies the mode of redundant ring,
which may be none, active, or passive. Active replication
offers slightly lower latency from transmit to delivery in
faulty network environments but with less performance.
Passive replication may nearly dou- ble the speed of the
totem protocol if the protocol doesnt become cpu bound. The
final option is none, in which case only one network
interface will be used to operate the totem proto- col.</p>

<p>If only one interface directive is specified, none is
automati- cally chosen. If multiple interface directives are
specified, only active or passive may be chosen.</p>

<p>netmtu This specifies the network maximum transmit unit.
To set this value beyond 1500, the regular frame MTU,
requires ethernet devices that support large, or also called
jumbo, frames. If any device in the network doesn t support
large frames, the pro- tocol will not operate properly. The
hosts must also have their mtu size set from 1500 to
whatever frame size is specified here.</p>

<p>Please note while some NICs or switches claim large
frame sup- port, they support 9000 MTU as the maximum frame
size including the IP header. Setting the netmtu and host
MTUs to 9000 will cause totem to use the full 9000 bytes of
the frame. Then Linux will add a 18 byte header moving the
full frame size to 9018. As a result some hardware will not
operate properly with this size of data. A netmtu of 8982
seems to work for the few large frame devices that have been
tested. Some manufacturers claim large frame support when in
fact they support frame sizes of 4500 bytes.</p>

<p>Increasing the MTU from 1500 to 8982 doubles throughput
perfor- mance from 30MB/sec to 60MB/sec as measured with
evsbench with 175000 byte messages with the secauth
directive set to off.</p>

<p>When sending multicast traffic, if the network
frequently recon- figures, chances are that some device in
the network doesnt support large frames.</p>

<p>Choose hardware carefully if intending to use large
frame sup- port.</p>

<p>The default is 1500.</p>

<p>threads This directive controls how many threads are
used to encrypt and send multicast messages. If secauth is
off, the protocol will never use threaded sending. If
secauth is on, this directive allows systems to be
configured to use multiple threads to encrypt and send
multicast messages.</p>

<p>A thread directive of 0 indicates that no threaded send
should be used. This mode offers best performance for
non-SMP systems.</p>

<p>The default is 0.</p>

<p>vsftype This directive controls the virtual synchrony
filter type used to identify a primary component. The
preferred choice is YKD dynamic linear voting, however, for
clusters larger then 32 nodes YKD consumes alot of memory.
For large scale clusters that are created by changing the
MAX_PROCESSORS_COUNT #define in the C code totem.h file, the
virtual synchrony filter &quot;none&quot; is recommended but
then AMF and DLCK services (which are currently
experimental) are not safe for use.</p>

<p>The default is ykd. The vsftype can also be set to
none.</p>

<p>Within the totem directive, there are several
configuration options which are used to control the
operation of the protocol. It is generally not recommended
to change any of these values without proper guidance and
sufficient testing. Some networks may require larger values
if suffering from frequent reconfigu- rations. Some
applications may require faster failure detection times
which can be achieved by reducing the token timeout.</p>

<p>token This timeout specifies in milliseconds until a
token loss is declared after not receiving a token. This is
the time spent detecting a failure of a processor in the
current configuration. Reforming a new configuration takes
about 50 milliseconds in addition to this timeout.</p>

<p>The default is 1000 milliseconds.</p>

<p>token_retransmit This timeout specifies in milliseconds
after how long before receiving a token the token is
retransmitted. This will be automatically calculated if
token is modified. It is not recom- mended to alter this
value without guidance from the openais community.</p>

<p>The default is 238 milliseconds.</p>

<p>hold This timeout specifies in milliseconds how long the
token should be held by the representative when the protocol
is under low utilization. It is not recommended to alter
this value without guidance from the openais community.</p>

<p>The default is 180 milliseconds.</p>

<p>retransmits_before_loss This value identifies how many
token retransmits should be attempted before forming a new
configuration. If this value is set, retransmit and hold
will be automatically calculated from
retransmits_before_loss and token.</p>

<p>The default is 4 retransmissions.</p>

<p>join This timeout specifies in milliseconds how long to
wait for join messages in the membership protocol.</p>

<p>The default is 100 milliseconds.</p>

<p>send_join This timeout specifies in milliseconds an
upper range between 0 and send_join to wait before sending a
join message. For con- figurations with less then 32 nodes,
this parameter is not nec- essary. For larger rings, this
parameter is necessary to ensure the NIC is not overflowed
with join messages on formation of a new ring. A reasonable
value for large rings (128 nodes) would be 80msec. Other
timer values must also change if this value is changed. Seek
advice from the openais mailing list if trying to run larger
configurations.</p>

<p>The default is 0 milliseconds.</p>

<p>consensus This timeout specifies in milliseconds how
long to wait for con- sensus to be achieved before starting
a new round of membership configuration.</p>

<p>The default is 200 milliseconds.</p>

<p>merge This timeout specifies in milliseconds how long to
wait before checking for a partition when no multicast
traffic is being sent. If multicast traffic is being sent,
the merge detection happens automatically as a function of
the protocol.</p>

<p>The default is 200 milliseconds.</p>

<p>downcheck This timeout specifies in milliseconds how
long to wait before checking that a network interface is
back up after it has been downed.</p>

<p>The default is 1000 millseconds.</p>

<p>fail_to_recv_const This constant specifies how many
rotations of the token without receiving any of the messages
when messages should be received may occur before a new
configuration is formed.</p>

<p>The default is 50 failures to receive a message.</p>

<p>seqno_unchanged_const This constant specifies how many
rotations of the token without any multicast traffic should
occur before the merge detection timeout is started.</p>

<p>The default is 30 rotations.</p>

<p>heartbeat_failures_allowed [HeartBeating mechanism]
Configures the optional HeartBeating mechanism for faster
failure detection. Keep in mind that engag- ing this
mechanism in lossy networks could cause faulty loss
declaration as the mechanism relies on the network for
heart- beating.</p>

<p>So as a rule of thumb use this mechanism if you require
improved failure in low to medium utilized networks.</p>

<p>This constant specifies the number of heartbeat failures
the system should tolerate before declaring heartbeat
failure e.g 3. Also if this value is not set or is 0 then
the heartbeat mecha- nism is not engaged in the system and
token rotation is the method of failure detection</p>

<p>The default is 0 (disabled).</p>

<p>max_network_delay [HeartBeating mechanism] This constant
specifies in milliseconds the approximate delay that your
network takes to transport one packet from one machine to
another. This value is to be set by system engineers and
please dont change if not sure as this effects the failure
detection mechanism using heartbeat.</p>

<p>The default is 50 milliseconds.</p>

<p>window_size This constant specifies the maximum number
of messages that may be sent on one token rotation. If all
processors perform equally well, this value could be large
(300), which would introduce higher latency from origination
to delivery for very large rings. To reduce latency in large
rings(16+), the defaults are a safe compromise. If 1 or more
slow processor(s) are present among fast processors,
window_size should be no larger then 256000 / netmtu to
avoid overflow of the kernel receive buffers. The user is
notified of this by the display of a retransmit list in the
notification logs. There is no loss of data, but performance
is reduced when these errors occur.</p>

<p>The default is 50 messages.</p>

<p>max_messages This constant specifies the maximum number
of messages that may be sent by one processor on receipt of
the token. The max_mes- sages parameter is limited to 256000
/ netmtu to prevent over- flow of the kernel transmit
buffers.</p>

<p>The default is 17 messages.</p>

<p>rrp_problem_count_timeout This specifies the time in
milliseconds to wait before decre- menting the problem count
by 1 for a particular ring to ensure a link is not marked
faulty for transient network failures.</p>

<p>The default is 1000 milliseconds.</p>

<p>rrp_problem_count_threshold This specifies the number of
times a problem is detected with a link before setting the
link faulty. Once a link is set faulty, no more data is
transmitted upon it. Also, the problem counter is no longer
decremented when the problem count timeout expires.</p>

<p>A problem is detected whenever all tokens from the
proceeding processor have not been received within the
rrp_token_expired_timeout. The rrp_problem_count_threshold *
rrp_token_expired_timeout should be atleast 50 milliseconds
less then the token timeout, or a complete reconfiguration
may occur.</p>

<p>The default is 20 problem counts.</p>

<p>rrp_token_expired_timeout This specifies the time in
milliseconds to increment the problem counter for the
redundant ring protocol after not having received a token
from all rings for a particular processor.</p>

<p>This value will automatically be calculated from the
token time- out and problem_count_threshold but may be
overridden. It is not recommended to override this value
without guidance from the openais community.</p>

<p>The default is 47 milliseconds.</p>

<p>Within the logging directive, there are seven
configuration options which are all optional:</p>

<p>to_stderr</p>

<p>to_file</p>

<p>to_syslog These specify the destination of logging
output. Any combination of these options may be specified.
Valid options are yes and no.</p>

<p>The default is syslog and stderr.</p>

<p>logfile If the to_file directive is set to yes , this
option specifies the pathname of the log file.</p>

<p>No default.</p>

<p>debug This specifies whether debug output is logged for
all services. This is generally a bad idea, unless there is
some specific bug or problem that must be found in the
executive. Set the value to on to debug, off to turn off
debugging. If enabled, individual loggers can be disabled
using a logger_subsys directive.</p>

<p>The default is off.</p>

<p>timestamp This specifies that a timestamp is placed on
all log messages.</p>

<p>The default is off.</p>

<p>fileline This specifies that file and line should be
printed instead of logger name.</p>

<p>The default is off.</p>

<p>syslog_facility This specifies the syslog facility type
that will be used for any messages sent to syslog. options
are daemon, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5,
local6 &amp; local7.</p>

<p>The default is daemon.</p>

<p>Within the logging directive, logger directives are
optional.</p>

<p>Within the logger_subsys sub-directive of logging there
are three con- figuration options:</p>

<p>subsys This specifies the subsystem identity (name) for
which logging is specified. This is the name used by a
service in the log_init () call. E.g. CKPT. This directive
is required.</p>

<p>debug This specifies whether debug output is logged for
this particu- lar logger.</p>

<p>The default is off.</p>

<p>syslog_level This specifies the syslog level for this
particular subsystem. Ignored if debug is on. Possible
values are: alert, crit, debug (same as debug = on), emerg,
err, info, notice, warning.</p>

<p>The default is: info.</p>

<p>tags This specifies which tags should be traced for this
particular logger. Set debug directive to on in order to
enable tracing using tags. Values are specified using a
vertical bar as a log- ical OR separator:</p>

<p>enter|leave|trace1|trace2|trace3|...</p>

<p>The default is none.</p>

<p>Within the event directive, there are two configuration
options which are all optional:</p>

<p>delivery_queue_size This directive describes the full
size of the outgoing delivery queue to the application. If
applications are slow to process messages, they will be
delivered event loss messages. By increasing this value, the
applications that are slowly process- ing messages may have
an opportunity to catch up.</p>

<p>delivery_queue_resume This directive describes when new
events can be accepted by the event service when the
delivery queue count of pending messages has reached this
value. Please note this is not cluster wide.</p>

<p>Within the amf directive, there is one configuration
option which is optional:</p>

<p>mode This can either contain the value enabled or
disabled. When enabled, AMF will start the applications
specified in the /etc/ais/amf.conf file. The default is
disabled.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ais/openais.conf The openais executive
configuration file.</p>
