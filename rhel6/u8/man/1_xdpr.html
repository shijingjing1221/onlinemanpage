<p>NAME xdpr - dump an X window directly to a printer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xdpr [ filename ] [ -display host:display ] [
-Pprinter ] [ -device devtype ] [ option ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xdpr uses the commands xwd, xpr, and lpr or
lp to dump an X window, process it for a particular printer
type, and print it out on the printer of your choice. This
is the easiest way to get a printout of a window. Xdpr by
default will print the largest possible representation of
the window on the output page.</p>

<p>The options for xdpr are the same as those for xpr, xwd,
and lpr or lp. The most commonly-used options are described
below; see the manual pages for these commands for more
detailed descriptions of the many options available.</p>

<p>OPTIONS filename Specifies a file containing a window
dump (created by xwd) to be printed instead of selecting an
X window.</p>

<p>-Pprinter Specifies a printer to send the output to. If
a printer name is not specified here, xdpr (really, lpr or
lp) will send your out- put to the printer specified by the
PRINTER environment vari- able. Be sure that type of the
printer matches the type speci- fied with the -device
option.</p>

<p>-display host:display[.screen] Normally, xdpr gets the
host and display number to use from the environment variable
DISPLAY. One can, however, specify them explicitly; see
X(1).</p>

<p>-device devtype Specifies the device on which the file
will be printed. Cur- rently supported: la100 Digital LA100
ljet HP LaserJet series and other monochrome PCL devices
such as ThinkJet, QuietJet, RuggedWriter, HP2560 series, and
HP 2930 series printers ln03 Digital LN03 pjet HP PaintJet
(color mode) pjetxl HP HP PaintJet XL Color Graphics Printer
(color mode) pp IBM PP3812 ps PostScript printer</p>

<p>The default is PostScript. -device lw (LaserWriter) is
equiva- lent to -device ps and is provided only for
backwards compati- bility.</p>

<p>-help This option displays the list of options known to
xdpr.</p>

<p>Any other arguments will be passed to the xwd, xpr, and
lpr or lp com- mands as appropriate for each.</p>
