<p>NAME ldns-dane - verify or create TLS authentication
with DANE (RFC6698)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-dane [OPTIONS] verify name port ldns-dane
[OPTIONS] -t tlsafile verify</p>

<p>ldns-dane [OPTIONS] name port create [ Certificate-usage
[ Selector [ Matching-type ] ] ]</p>

<p>ldns-dane -h ldns-dane -v</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In the first form: A TLS connection to
name:port is established. The TLSA resource record(s) for
name are used to authenticate the connec- tion.</p>

<p>In the second form: The TLSA record(s) are read from
tlsafile and used to authenticate the TLS service they
reference.</p>

<p>In the third form: A TLS connection to name:port is
established and used to create the TLSA resource record(s)
that would authenticate the connection. The parameters for
TLSA rr creation are:</p>

<p>Certificate-usage: 0 CA constraint 1 Service certificate
constraint 2 Trust anchor assertion 3 Domain-issued
certificate (default)</p>

<p>Selector: 0 Full certificate (default) 1
SubjectPublicKeyInfo</p>

<p>Matching-type: 0 No hash used 1 SHA-256 (default) 2
SHA-512</p>

<p>In stead of numbers the first few letters of the value
may be used. Except for the hash algorithm name, where the
full name must be speci- fied.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -4 TLS connect IPv4 only</p>

<p>-6 TLS connect IPv6 only</p>

<p>-a address Don t try to resolve name, but connect to
address instead.</p>

<p>This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>-b print &quot;name. TYPE52 sentation format.</p>

<p>-c certfile Do not TLS connect to name:port, but
authenticate (or make TLSA records) for the certificate
(chain) in certfile instead.</p>

<p>-d Assume DNSSEC validity even when the TLSA records
were acquired insecure or were bogus.</p>

<p>-f CAfile Use CAfile to validate. Default is
/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bun- dle.trust.crt</p>

<p>-h Print short usage help</p>

<p>-i Interact after connecting.</p>

<p>-k keyfile Specify a file that contains a trusted DNSKEY
or DS rr. Key(s) are used when chasing signatures (i.e. -S
is given).</p>

<p>This option may be given more than once.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if -k is not specified, and a default
trust anchor (/var/lib/unbound/root.key) exists and contains
a valid DNSKEY or DS record, it will be used as the trust
anchor.</p>

<p>-n Do not verify server name in certificate.</p>

<p>-o offset When creating a &quot;Trust anchor
assertion&quot; TLSA resource record, select the offsetth
certificate offset from the end of the vali- dation chain. 0
means the last certificate, 1 the one but last, 2 the second
but last, etc.</p>

<p>When offset is -1 (the default), the last certificate is
used (like with 0) that MUST be self-signed. This can help
to make sure that the intended (self signed) trust anchor is
actually present in the server certificate chain (which is a
DANE requirement).</p>

<p>-p CApath Use certificates in the CApath directory to
validate. Default is /etc/pki/tls/certs/</p>

<p>-s When creating TLSA resource records with the &quot;CA
Constraint&quot; and the &quot;Service Certificate
Constraint&quot; certificate usage, do not validate and
assume PKIX is valid.</p>

<p>For &quot;CA Constraint&quot; this means that
verification should end with a self-signed certificate.</p>

<p>-S Chase signature(s) to a known key.</p>

<p>Without this option, the local network is trusted to
provide a DNSSEC resolver (i.e. AD bit is checked).</p>

<p>-t tlsafile Read TLSA record(s) from tlsafile. When name
and port are also given, only TLSA records that match the
name, port and transport are used. Otherwise the owner name
of the TLSA record(s) will be used to determine name, port
and transport.</p>

<p>-u Use UDP transport instead of TCP.</p>

<p>-v Show version and exit.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/unbound/root.key The file from which
trusted keys are loaded for signature chas- ing, when no -k
option is given.</p>
