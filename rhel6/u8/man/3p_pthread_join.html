<p>PTHREAD_JOIN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_JOIN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_join - wait for thread termination</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void
**value_ptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_join() function shall suspend
execution of the calling thread until the target thread
terminates, unless the target thread has already terminated.
On return from a successful pthread_join() call with a
non-NULL value_ptr argument, the value passed to
pthread_exit() by the terminating thread shall be made
available in the location ref- erenced by value_ptr. When a
pthread_join() returns successfully, the target thread has
been terminated. The results of multiple simultaneous calls
to pthread_join() specifying the same target thread are
unde- fined. If the thread calling pthread_join() is
canceled, then the tar- get thread shall not be
detached.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether a thread that has exited but
remains unjoined counts against {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX}.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_join() function
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_join() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The implementation has detected that the value
specified by thread does not refer to a joinable thread.</p>

<p>ESRCH No thread could be found corresponding to that
specified by the given thread ID.</p>

<p>The pthread_join() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EDEADLK A deadlock was detected or the value of thread
specifies the calling thread.</p>

<p>The pthread_join() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES An example of thread creation and deletion
follows:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int *ar; long n; } subarray;</p>

<p>void * incer(void *arg) { long i;</p>

<p>for (i = 0; i &lt; ((subarray *)arg)-&gt;n; i++)
((subarray *)arg)-&gt;ar[i]++; }</p>

<p>int main(void) { int ar[1000000]; pthread_t th1, th2;
subarray sb1, sb2;</p>

<p>sb1.ar = &amp;ar[0]; sb1.n = 500000; (void)
pthread_create(&amp;th1, NULL, incer, &amp;sb1);</p>

<p>sb2.ar = &amp;ar[500000]; sb2.n = 500000; (void)
pthread_create(&amp;th2, NULL, incer, &amp;sb2);</p>

<p>(void) pthread_join(th1, NULL); (void) pthread_join(th2,
NULL); return 0; }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pthread_join() function is a convenience
that has proven useful in multi-threaded applications. It is
true that a programmer could simu- late this function if it
were not provided by passing extra state as part of the
argument to the start_routine(). The terminating thread
would set a flag to indicate termination and broadcast a
condition that is part of that state; a joining thread would
wait on that condition variable. While such a technique
would allow a thread to wait on more complex conditions (for
example, waiting for multiple threads to termi- nate),
waiting on individual thread termination is considered
widely useful. Also, including the pthread_join() function
in no way precludes a programmer from coding such complex
waits. Thus, while not a primi- tive, including
pthread_join() in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 was
considered valuable.</p>

<p>The pthread_join() function provides a simple mechanism
allowing an application to wait for a thread to terminate.
After the thread termi- nates, the application may then
choose to clean up resources that were used by the thread.
For instance, after pthread_join() returns, any
application-provided stack storage could be reclaimed.</p>

<p>The pthread_join() or pthread_detach() function should
eventually be called for every thread that is created with
the detachstate attribute set to PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE so
that storage associated with the thread may be
reclaimed.</p>

<p>The interaction between pthread_join() and cancellation
is well-defined for the following reasons:</p>

<p>* The pthread_join() function, like all other
non-async-cancel-safe functions, can only be called with
deferred cancelability type.</p>

<p>* Cancellation cannot occur in the disabled
cancelability state.</p>

<p>Thus, only the default cancelability state need be
considered. As spec- ified, either the pthread_join() call
is canceled, or it succeeds, but not both. The difference is
obvious to the application, since either a cancellation
handler is run or pthread_join() returns. There are no race
conditions since pthread_join() was called in the deferred
cance- lability state.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
