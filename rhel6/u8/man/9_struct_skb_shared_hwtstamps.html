SKB_SHARED_HW(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_skb_shared_hwtstamps - hardware time
stamps</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct skb_shared_hwtstamps { ktime_t hwtstamp;
ktime_t syststamp; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS hwtstamp hardware time stamp transformed into
duration since arbitrary point in time</p>

<p>syststamp hwtstamp transformed to system time base</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Software time stamps generated by
ktime_get_real are stored in skb-&gt;tstamp. The relation
between the different kinds of time</p>

<p>STAMPS IS AS FOLLOWS syststamp and tstamp can be
compared against each other in arbitrary combinations. The
accuracy of a syststamp/tstamp/syststamp from other device
comparison is limited by the accuracy of the transformation
into system time base. This depends on the device driver and
its underlying hardware.</p>

<p>hwtstamps can only be compared against other hwtstamps
from the same device.</p>

<p>This structure is attached to packets as part of the
skb_shared_info. Use skb_hwtstamps to get a pointer.</p>
