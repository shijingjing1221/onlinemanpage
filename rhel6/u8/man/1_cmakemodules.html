<p>NAME cmakemodules - Reference of available CMake
modules.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;cmake&quot; executable is the
CMake command-line interface. It may be used to configure
projects in scripts. Project configuration settings may be
specified on the command line with the -D option. The -i
option will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such
settings.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>MODULES The following modules are provided with CMake.
They can be used with INCLUDE(ModuleName).</p>

<p>CMake Modules - Modules coming with CMake, the
Cross-Platform Makefile Generator.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for the modules and scripts
coming with CMake. Using these modules you can check the
computer system for installed software packages, features of
the compiler and the existence of headers to name just a
few.</p>

<p>AddFileDependencies ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file
depend_files...)</p>

<p>Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file</p>

<p>BundleUtilities Functions to help assemble a standalone
bundle application.</p>

<p>A collection of CMake utility functions useful for
dealing with .app bundles on the Mac and bundle-like
directories on any OS.</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this module:</p>

<p>fixup_bundle copy_and_fixup_bundle verify_app
get_bundle_main_executable get_dotapp_dir
get_bundle_and_executable get_bundle_all_executables
get_item_key clear_bundle_keys set_bundle_key_values
get_bundle_keys copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle fixup_bundle_item
verify_bundle_prerequisites verify_bundle_symlinks</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function,
break and PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on
GetPrerequisites.cmake.</p>

<p>FIXUP_BUNDLE(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Fix up a bundle in-place and make it standalone, such
that it can be drag-n-drop copied to another machine and run
on that machine as long as all of the system libraries are
compatible.</p>

<p>If you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs
parameter, you should install them or copy them into the
bundle before calling fixup_bundle. The &quot;libs&quot;
parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but
that cannot be determined by otool output analysis. (i.e.,
plugins)</p>

<p>Gather all the keys for all the executables and
libraries in a bundle, and then, for each key, copy each
prerequisite into the bundle. Then fix each one up according
to its own list of pre- requisites.</p>

<p>Then clear all the keys and call verify_app on the final
bundle to ensure that it is truly standalone.</p>

<p>COPY_AND_FIXUP_BUNDLE(&lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;
&lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Makes a copy of the bundle &lt;src&gt; at location
&lt;dst&gt; and then fixes up the new copied bundle in-place
at &lt;dst&gt;...</p>

<p>VERIFY_APP(&lt;app&gt;)</p>

<p>Verifies that an application &lt;app&gt; appears valid
based on run- ning analysis tools on it. Calls
&quot;message(FATAL_ERROR&quot; if the application is not
verified.</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_MAIN_EXECUTABLE(&lt;bundle&gt;
&lt;result_var&gt;)</p>

<p>The result will be the full path name of the bundles
main exe- cutable file or an &quot;error:&quot; prefixed
string if it could not be determined.</p>

<p>GET_DOTAPP_DIR(&lt;exe&gt; &lt;dotapp_dir_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Returns the nearest parent dir whose name ends with
&quot;.app&quot; given the full path to an executable. If
there is no such parent dir, then simply return the dir
containing the executable.</p>

<p>The returned directory may or may not exist.</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_AND_EXECUTABLE(&lt;app&gt; &lt;bundle_var&gt;
&lt;executable_var&gt; &lt;valid_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Takes either a &quot;.app&quot; directory name or the
name of an exe- cutable nested inside a &quot;.app&quot;
directory and returns the path to the &quot;.app&quot;
directory in &lt;bundle_var&gt; and the path to its main
executable in &lt;executable_var&gt;</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_ALL_EXECUTABLES(&lt;bundle&gt;
&lt;exes_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Scans the given bundle recursively for all executable
files and accumulates them into a variable.</p>

<p>GET_ITEM_KEY(&lt;item&gt; &lt;key_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Given a file (item) name, generate a key that should be
unique considering the set of libraries that need copying or
fixing up to make a bundle standalone. This is essentially
the file name including extension with &quot;.&quot;
replaced by &quot;_&quot;</p>

<p>This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that
we can associate a set of variables with a given item based
on its key.</p>

<p>CLEAR_BUNDLE_KEYS(&lt;keys_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Loop over the list of keys, clearing all the variables
associ- ated with each key. After the loop, clear the list
of keys itself.</p>

<p>Caller of get_bundle_keys should call clear_bundle_keys
when done with list of keys.</p>

<p>SET_BUNDLE_KEY_VALUES(&lt;keys_var&gt; &lt;context&gt;
&lt;item&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;copyflag&gt;)</p>

<p>Add a key to the list (if necessary) for the given item.
If added, also set all the variables associated with that
key.</p>

<p>GET_BUNDLE_KEYS(&lt;app&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;keys_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Loop over all the executable and library files within
the bundle (and given as extra &lt;libs&gt;) and accumulate
a list of keys repre- senting them. Set values associated
with each key such that we can loop over all of them and
copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do
appropriate install_name_tool fixups.</p>

<p>COPY_RESOLVED_ITEM_INTO_BUNDLE(&lt;resolved_item&gt;
&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)</p>

<p>Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary. Copy
is not necessary if the resolved_item is &quot;the same
as&quot; the resolved_embedded_item.</p>


<p>COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE(&lt;resolved_item&gt;
&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;)</p>

<p>Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary.
Copy is not necessary if the resolved_item is &quot;the same
as&quot; the resolved_embedded_item.</p>

<p>By default, BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS is not set.
If you want full frameworks embedded in your bundles, set
BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS to ON before calling
fixup_bundle. By default,
COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE copies the framework
dylib itself plus the framework Resources directory.</p>

<p>FIXUP_BUNDLE_ITEM(&lt;resolved_embedded_item&gt;
&lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Get the direct/non-system prerequisites of the resolved
embedded item. For each prerequisite, change the way it is
referenced to the value of the _EMBEDDED_ITEM keyed variable
for that prereq- uisite. (Most likely changing to an
&quot;@executable_path&quot; style reference.)</p>

<p>This function requires that the resolved_embedded_item
be &quot;inside&quot; the bundle already. In other words, if
you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you
should install them or copy them into the bundle before
calling fixup_bundle. The &quot;libs&quot; parameter is a
list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be
determined by otool output analysis. (i.e., plugins)</p>

<p>Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its
own _EMBEDDED_ITEM value.</p>

<p>Accumulate changes in a local variable and make *one*
call to install_name_tool at the end of the function with
all the changes at once.</p>

<p>If the BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS variable is set then bundle
items will be marked writable before install_name_tool tries
to change them.</p>

<p>VERIFY_BUNDLE_PREREQUISITES(&lt;bundle&gt;
&lt;result_var&gt; &lt;info_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files
inside the bundle are contained within the bundle or are
&quot;system&quot; libraries, presumed to exist
everywhere.</p>

<p>VERIFY_BUNDLE_SYMLINKS(&lt;bundle&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;
&lt;info_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Verifies that any symlinks found in the bundle point to
other files that are already also in the bundle... Anything
that points to an external file causes this function to fail
the ver- ification.</p>

<p>CMakeAddFortranSubdirectory Use MinGW gfortran from VS
if a fortran compiler is not found.</p>

<p>The add_fortran_subdirectory function adds a
subdirectory to a project that contains a fortran only
sub-project. The module will check the current compiler and
see if it can support for- tran. If no fortran compiler is
found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module will find
the MinGW gfortran. It will then use an external project to
build with the MinGW tools. It will also create imported
targets for the libraries created. This will only work if
the fortran code is built into a dll, so BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
is turned on in the project. In addition the CMAKE_GNUtoMS
option is set to on, so that the MS .lib files are created.
Usage is as follows:</p>

<p>cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory( &lt;subdir&gt; # name of
subdirectory PROJECT &lt;project_name&gt; # project name in
subdir top CMakeLists.txt ARCHIVE_DIR &lt;dir&gt; # dir
where project places .lib files RUNTIME_DIR &lt;dir&gt; #
dir where project places .dll files LIBRARIES &lt;lib&gt;...
# names of library targets to import LINK_LIBRARIES # link
interface libraries for LIBRARIES [LINK_LIBS &lt;lib&gt;
&lt;dep&gt;...]... CMAKE_COMMAND_LINE ... # extra command
line flags to pass to cmake NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL # skip
installation of external project )</p>

<p>Relative paths in ARCHIVE_DIR and RUNTIME_DIR are
interpreted with respect to the build directory
corresponding to the source directory in which the function
is invoked.</p>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL is required for forward
compatibility with a future version that supports
installation of the external project binaries during
&quot;make install&quot;.</p>

<p>CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX define a bunch of
backwards compatibility variables</p>

<p>CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++
CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has &lt;strstream&gt;
include(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
include(CheckIncludeFileCXX) include(TestForSTDNamespace)
include(TestForANSIForScope)</p>

<p>CMakeDependentOption Macro to provide an option
dependent on other options.</p>

<p>This macro presents an option to the user only if a set
of other conditions are true. When the option is not
presented a default value is used, but any value set by the
user is preserved for when the option is presented again.
Example invocation:</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO &quot;Use Foo&quot; ON
&quot;USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT&quot; OFF)</p>

<p>If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides
an option called USE_FOO that defaults to ON. Otherwise, it
sets USE_FOO to OFF. If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT
ever changes, any value for the USE_FOO option is saved so
that when the option is re-enabled it retains its old
value.</p>

<p>CMakeDetermineVSServicePack Determine the Visual Studio
service pack of the cl in use.</p>

<p>The functionality of this module has been superseded by
the platform variable CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION
that contains the compiler version number.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>if(MSVC) include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)
DetermineVSServicePack( my_service_pack ) if(
my_service_pack ) message(STATUS &quot;Detected:
${my_service_pack}&quot;) endif() endif()</p>

<p>Function DetermineVSServicePack sets the given variable
to one of the following values or an empty string if
unknown:</p>

<p>vc80, vc80sp1 vc90, vc90sp1 vc100, vc100sp1 vc110,
vc110sp1, vc110sp2</p>

<p>CMakeExpandImportedTargets</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS(&lt;var&gt; LIBRARIES lib1
lib2...libN</p>

<p>[CONFIGURATION &lt;config&gt;] )</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of
libraries and replaces all imported targets contained in
this list with their actual file paths of the referenced
libraries on disk, including the libraries from their link
interfaces. If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the
respective configuration of the imported tar- gets if it
exists. If no CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the first
configuration from ${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set,
otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}. This macro is used by all
Check*.cmake files which use try_compile() or try_run() and
sup- port CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES , so that these checks
support imported targets in CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES:</p>

<p>cmake_expand_imported_targets(expandedLibs LIBRARIES
${CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES} CONFIGURATION
&quot;${CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION}&quot; )</p>

<p>CMakeFindFrameworks helper module to find OSX
frameworks</p>

<p>CMakeFindPackageMode</p>

<p>This file is executed by cmake when invoked with
--find-package. It expects that the following variables are
set using -D:</p>

<p>NAME = name of the package COMPILER_ID = the CMake
compiler ID for which the result is, i.e.
GNU/Intel/Clang/MSVC, etc. LANGUAGE = language for which the
result will be used, i.e. C/CXX/Fortan/ASM MODE = EXIST :
only check for existence of the given package COMPILE :
print the flags needed for compiling an object file which
uses the given package LINK : print the flags needed for
linking when using the given package QUIET = if TRUE, dont
print anything</p>

<p>CMakeForceCompiler</p>

<p>This module defines macros intended for use by
cross-compiling toolchain files when CMake is not able to
automatically detect the compiler identification.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the
cmake internal variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given
compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler
and basic com- piler information tests.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the
cmake internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given
com- piler-id. It also bypasses the check for working
compiler and basic compiler information tests.</p>

<p>Macro CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER has the following
signature:</p>

<p>CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER(&lt;compiler&gt;
&lt;compiler-id&gt;)</p>

<p>It sets CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER to the given compiler and
the cmake internal variable CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID to the
given compiler-id. It also bypasses the check for working
compiler and basic compiler information tests.</p>

<p>So a simple toolchain file could look like this:</p>

<p>include (CMakeForceCompiler) set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
Generic) CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)</p>

<p>CMakeGraphVizOptions The builtin graphviz support of
CMake.</p>

<p>CMake can generate graphviz files, showing the
dependencies between the targets in a project and also
external libraries which are linked against. When CMake is
run with the --gra- phiz=foo option, it will produce</p>

<p>* a foo.dot file showing all dependencies in the project
* a foo.dot.&lt;target&gt; file for each target, file
showing on which other targets the respective target depends
* a foo.dot.&lt;target&gt;.dependers file, showing which
other targets depend on the respective target</p>

<p>This can result in huge graphs. Using the file
CMakeGraphVizOp- tions.cmake the look and content of the
generated graphs can be influenced. This file is searched
first in ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} and then in
${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}. If found, it is read and the variables
set in it are used to adjust options for the generated
graphviz files.</p>

<p>GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_TYPE - The graph type Mandatory : NO
Default : &quot;digraph&quot; GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_NAME - The
graph name. Mandatory : NO Default : &quot;GG&quot;
GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_HEADER - The header written at the top of the
graphviz file. Mandatory : NO Default : &quot;node [n
fontsize = &quot;12&quot;];&quot; GRAPHVIZ_NODE_PREFIX - The
prefix for each node in the graphviz file. Mandatory : NO
Default : &quot;node&quot; GRAPHVIZ_EXECUTABLES - Set this
to FALSE to exclude executables from the generated graphs.
Mandatory : NO Default : TRUE GRAPHVIZ_STATIC_LIBS - Set
this to FALSE to exclude static libraries from the generated
graphs. Mandatory : NO Default : TRUE GRAPHVIZ_SHARED_LIBS -
Set this to FALSE to exclude shared libraries from the
generated graphs. Mandatory : NO Default : TRUE
GRAPHVIZ_MODULE_LIBS - Set this to FALSE to exclude static
libraries from the generated graphs. Mandatory : NO Default
: TRUE GRAPHVIZ_EXTERNAL_LIBS - Set this to FALSE to exclude
external libraries from the generated graphs. Mandatory : NO
Default : TRUE GRAPHVIZ_IGNORE_TARGETS - A list of regular
expressions for ignoring targets. Mandatory : NO Default :
empty</p>

<p>CMakePackageConfigHelpers
CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE(), WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VER-
SION_FILE()</p>

<p>CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE(&lt;input&gt;
&lt;output&gt; INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;path&gt; [PATH_VARS
&lt;var1&gt; &lt;var2&gt; ... &lt;varN&gt;]
[NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO]
[NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO])</p>

<p>CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() should be used instead
of the plain configure_file() command when creating the
&lt;Name&gt;Con- fig.cmake or &lt;Name&gt;-config.cmake file
for installing a project or library. It helps making the
resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths in
the installed Config.cmake file.</p>

<p>In a FooConfig.cmake file there may be code like this to
make the install destinations know to the using project:</p>

<p>set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR
&quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@&quot; )
set(FOO_DATA_DIR
&quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;
) set(FOO_ICONS_DIR
&quot;@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons&quot; ) ...logic to
determine installedPrefix from the own location...
set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR
&quot;${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@&quot; )</p>

<p>All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the
first 3 hardcode the absolute directory locations, and the
4th case works only if the logic to determine the
installedPrefix is cor- rect, and if CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR
contains a relative path, which in general cannot be
guaranteed. This has the effect that the resulting
FooConfig.cmake file would work poorly under Windows and
OSX, where users are used to choose the install location of
a binary package at install time, independent from how
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX was set at build/cmake time.</p>

<p>Using CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() helps. If used
correctly, it makes the resulting FooConfig.cmake file
relocatable. Usage:</p>

<p>1. write a FooConfig.cmake.in file as you are used to 2.
insert a line containing only the string
&quot;@PACKAGE_INIT@&quot; 3. instead of set(FOO_DIR
&quot;@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;), use set(FOO_DIR
&quot;@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;) (this must be after
the @PACKAGE_INIT@ line) 4. instead of using the normal
configure_file(), use CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE()</p>

<p>The &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt; arguments are the
input and output file, the same way as in
configure_file().</p>

<p>The &lt;path&gt; given to INSTALL_DESTINATION must be
the destination where the FooConfig.cmake file will be
installed to. This can either be a relative or absolute
path, both work.</p>

<p>The variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt; given as
PATH_VARS are the vari- ables which contain install
destinations. For each of them the macro will create a
helper variable PACKAGE_&lt;var...&gt;. These helper
variables must be used in the FooConfig.cmake.in file for
setting the installed location. They are calculated by
CONFIG- URE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE() so that they are always
relative to the installed location of the package. This
works both for rela- tive and also for absolute locations.
For absolute locations it works only if the absolute
location is a subdirectory of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>By default configure_package_config_file() also
generates two helper macros, set_and_check() and
check_required_components() into the FooConfig.cmake
file.</p>

<p>set_and_check() should be used instead of the normal
set() com- mand for setting directories and file locations.
Additionally to setting the variable it also checks that the
referenced file or directory actually exists and fails with
a FATAL_ERROR other- wise. This makes sure that the created
FooConfig.cmake file does not contain wrong references. When
using the NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO, this macro is not
generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.</p>

<p>check_required_components(&lt;package_name&gt;) should
be called at the end of the FooConfig.cmake file if the
package supports com- ponents. This macro checks whether all
requested, non-optional components have been found, and if
this is not the case, sets the Foo_FOUND variable to FALSE,
so that the package is consid- ered to be not found. It does
that by testing the Foo_&lt;Compo- nent&gt;_FOUND variables
for all requested required components. When using the
NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS option, this macro is not
generated into the FooConfig.cmake file.</p>

<p>For an example see below the documentation for
WRITE_BASIC_PACK- AGE_VERSION_FILE().</p>

<p>WRITE_BASIC_PACKAGE_VERSION_FILE( filename VERSION
major.minor.patch COMPATIBILITY
(AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|ExactVersion) )</p>

<p>Writes a file for use as
&lt;package&gt;ConfigVersion.cmake file to &lt;filename&gt;.
See the documentation of find_package() for details on
this.</p>

<p>filename is the output filename, it should be in the
build tree. major.minor.patch is the version number of the
project to be installed</p>

<p>The COMPATIBILITY mode AnyNewerVersion means that the
installed package version will be considered compatible if
it is newer or exactly the same as the requested version.
This mode should be used for packages which are fully
backward compatible, also across major versions. If
SameMajorVersion is used instead, then the behaviour differs
from AnyNewerVersion in that the major version number must
be the same as requested, e.g. version 2.0 will not be
considered compatible if 1.0 is requested. This mode should
be used for packages which guarantee backward compatibil-
ity within the same major version. If ExactVersion is used,
then the package is only considered compatible if the
requested ver- sion matches exactly its own version number
(not considering the tweak version). For example, version
1.2.3 of a package is only considered compatible to
requested version 1.2.3. This mode is for packages without
compatibility guarantees. If your project has more
elaborated version matching rules, you will need to write
your own custom ConfigVersion.cmake file instead of using
this macro.</p>

<p>Internally, this macro executes configure_file() to
create the resulting version file. Depending on the
COMPATIBLITY, either the file
BasicConfigVersion-SameMajorVersion.cmake.in or Basic-
ConfigVersion-AnyNewerVersion.cmake.in is used. Please note
that these two files are internal to CMake and you should
not call configure_file() on them yourself, but they can be
used as starting point to create more sophisticted custom
ConfigVer- sion.cmake files.</p>

<p>Example using both configure_package_config_file() and
write_basic_package_version_file(): CMakeLists.txt:</p>

<p>set(INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR include/ ... CACHE )
set(LIB_INSTALL_DIR lib/ ... CACHE )
set(SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR etc/foo/ ... CACHE ) ...
include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
configure_package_config_file(FooConfig.cmake.in
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
INSTALL_DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake PATH_VARS
INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR)
write_basic_package_version_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
VERSION 1.2.3 COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion ) install(FILES
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake )</p>

<p>With a FooConfig.cmake.in:</p>

<p>set(FOO_VERSION x.y.z) ... @PACKAGE_INIT@ ...
set_and_check(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR
&quot;@PACKAGE_INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;)
set_and_check(FOO_SYSCONFIG_DIR
&quot;@PACKAGE_SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@&quot;)</p>

<p>check_required_components(Foo)</p>

<p>CMakeParseArguments</p>

<p>CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS(&lt;prefix&gt; &lt;options&gt;
&lt;one_value_keywords&gt; &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;
args...)</p>

<p>CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() is intended to be used in macros
or functions for parsing the arguments given to that macro
or func- tion. It processes the arguments and defines a set
of variables which hold the values of the respective
options.</p>

<p>The &lt;options&gt; argument contains all options for
the respective macro, i.e. keywords which can be used when
calling the macro without any value following, like e.g. the
OPTIONAL keyword of the install() command.</p>

<p>The &lt;one_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all
keywords for this macro which are followed by one value,
like e.g. DESTINATION keyword of the install() command.</p>

<p>The &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt; argument contains all
keywords for this macro which can be followed by more than
one value, like e.g. the TARGETS or FILES keywords of the
install() command.</p>

<p>When done, CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() will have defined for
each of the keywords listed in &lt;options&gt;,
&lt;one_value_keywords&gt; and &lt;multi_value_keywords&gt;
a variable composed of the given &lt;prefix&gt; followed by
&quot;_&quot; and the name of the respective keyword. These
variables will then hold the respective value from the
argument list. For the &lt;options&gt; keywords this will be
TRUE or FALSE.</p>

<p>All remaining arguments are collected in a variable
&lt;pre- fix&gt;_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS, this can be checked
afterwards to see whether your macro was called with
unrecognized parameters.</p>

<p>As an example here a my_install() macro, which takes
similar arguments as the real install() command:</p>

<p>function(MY_INSTALL) set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME) set(multiValueArgs
TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS) cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL
&quot;${options}&quot; &quot;${oneValueArgs}&quot;
&quot;${multiValueArgs}&quot; ${ARGN} ) ...</p>

<p>Assume my_install() has been called like this:</p>

<p>my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL
blub)</p>

<p>After the cmake_parse_arguments() call the macro will
have set the following variables:</p>

<p>MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE (this
option was not used when calling my_install()
MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = &quot;bin&quot; MY_INSTALL_RENAME =
&quot;&quot; (was not used) MY_INSTALL_TARGETS =
&quot;foo;bar&quot; MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS = &quot;&quot;
(was not used) MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS =
&quot;blub&quot; (no value expected after
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;</p>

<p>You can then continue and process these variables.</p>

<p>Keywords terminate lists of values, e.g. if directly
after a one_value_keyword another recognized keyword
follows, this is interpreted as the beginning of the new
option. E.g. my_install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION OPTIONAL)
would result in MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION set to
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;, but MY_INSTALL_DESTI- NATION would be
empty and MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL would be set to TRUE
therefor.</p>

<p>CMakePrintHelpers Convenience macros for printing
properties and variables, useful e.g. for debugging.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PRINT_PROPERTIES([TARGETS target1 .. targetN]</p>

<p>[SOURCES source1 .. sourceN] [DIRECTORIES dir1 .. dirN]
[TESTS test1 .. testN] [CACHE_ENTRIES entry1 .. entryN]
PROPERTIES prop1 .. propN )</p>

<p>This macro prints the values of the properties of the
given tar- gets, source files, directories, tests or cache
entries. Exactly one of the scope keywords must be used.
Example:</p>

<p>cmake_print_properties(TARGETS foo bar PROPERTIES
LOCATION INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRS)</p>

<p>This will print the LOCATION and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRS
proper- ties for both targets foo and bar.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PRINT_VARIABLES(var1 var2 .. varN)</p>

<p>This macro will print the name of each variable followed
by its value. Example:</p>

<p>cmake_print_variables(CMAKE_C_COMPILER
CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION THIS_ONE_DOES_NOT_EXIST)</p>

<p>Gives:</p>

<p>-- CMAKE_C_COMPILER=&quot;/usr/bin/gcc&quot; ;
CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION=&quot;2&quot; ;
THIS_ONE_DOES_NOT_EXIST=&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>CMakePrintSystemInformation print system information</p>

<p>This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just
include it in a project to see various internal CMake
variables.</p>

<p>CMakePushCheckState</p>

<p>This module defines three macros:
CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE() and
CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE() These macros can be used to save,
restore and reset (i.e., clear con- tents) the state of the
variables CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS, CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS,
CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES and CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES used by
the various Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g.
check_function_exists() etc. The variable contents are
pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is sup- ported.
This is useful e.g. when executing such tests in a
Find-module, where they have to be set, but after the
Find-mod- ule has been executed they should have the same
value as they had before.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() macro receives optional
argument RESET. Whether its specified,
CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() will set all CMAKE_REQUIRED_*
variables to empty values, same as CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()
call will do.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>cmake_push_check_state(RESET)
set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DSOME_MORE_DEF)
check_function_exists(...) cmake_reset_check_state()
set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DANOTHER_DEF)
check_function_exists(...) cmake_pop_check_state()</p>

<p>CMakeVerifyManifest</p>

<p>CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake</p>

<p>This script is used to verify that embeded manifests and
side by side manifests for a project match. To run this
script, cd to a directory and run the script with cmake -P.
On the command line you can pass in versions that are OK
even if not found in the .manifest files. For example, cmake
-Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0 -PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake
could be used to allow an embeded manifest of 8.0.50608.0 to
be used in a project even if that version was not found in
the .manifest file.</p>

<p>CPack Build binary and source package installers.</p>

<p>The CPack module generates binary and source installers
in a variety of formats using the cpack program. Inclusion
of the CPack module adds two new targets to the resulting
makefiles, package and package_source, which build the
binary and source installers, respectively. The generated
binary installers con- tain everything installed via CMake s
INSTALL command (and the deprecated INSTALL_FILES,
INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).</p>

<p>For certain kinds of binary installers (including the
graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack
generates installers that allow users to select individual
application components to install. See CPackComponent module
for that.</p>

<p>The CPACK_GENERATOR variable has different meanings in
different contexts. In your CMakeLists.txt file,
CPACK_GENERATOR is a *list of generators*: when run with no
other arguments, CPack will iterate over that list and
produce one package for each generator. In a
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE, though, CPACK_GENERA- TOR is a
*string naming a single generator*. If you need per-cpack-
generator logic to control *other* cpack settings, then you
need a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.</p>

<p>The CMake source tree itself contains a
CPACK_PROJECT_CON- FIG_FILE. See the top level file
CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in for an example.</p>

<p>If set, the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE is included
automatically on a per-generator basis. It only need contain
overrides.</p>

<p>Heres how it works:</p>

<p>- cpack runs - it includes CPackConfig.cmake - it
iterates over the generators listed in that files
CPACK_GENERATOR list variable (unless told to use just a
specific one via -G on the command line...)</p>

<p>- foreach generator, it then - sets CPACK_GENERATOR to
the one currently being iterated - includes the
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE - produces the package for that
generator</p>

<p>This is the key: For each generator listed in
CPACK_GENERATOR in CPackConfig.cmake, cpack will *reset*
CPACK_GENERATOR internally to *the one currently being used*
and then include the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.</p>

<p>Before including this CPack module in your
CMakeLists.txt file, there are a variety of variables that
can be set to customize the resulting installers. The most
commonly-used variables are:</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME - The name of the package (or
application). If not specified, defaults to the project
name.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR - The name of the package vendor.
(e.g., &quot;Kitware&quot;).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY - The directory in which CPack
is doing its packaging. If it is not set then this will
default (internally) to the build dir. This variable may be
defined in CPack config file or from the cpack command line
option &quot;-B&quot;. If set the command line option
override the value found in the config file.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR - Package major Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR - Package minor Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH - Package patch Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE - A text file used to
describe the project. Used, for example, the introduction
screen of a CPack-generated Windows installer to describe
the project.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY - Short description of
the project (only a few words).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the package file
to generate, not including the extension. For example,
cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686. The default value is</p>


<p>${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY - Installation directory
on the target system. This may be used by some CPack
generators like NSIS to create an installation directory
e.g., &quot;CMake 2.5&quot; below the installation prefix.
All installed element will be put inside this directory.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON - A branding image that will be
displayed inside the installer (used by GUI installers).</p>

<p>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE - CPack-time project CPack
configuration file. This file included at cpack time, once
per generator after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR to the
actual generator being used. It allows per-generator setting
of CPACK_* variables at cpack time.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE - License to be embedded in
the installer. It will typically be displayed to the user by
the produced installer (often with an explicit
&quot;Accept&quot; button, for graphical installers) prior
to installation. This license file is NOT added to installed
file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you
want to install a license file (may be the same as this one)
along with your project you must add an appropriate CMake
INSTALL command in your CMakeLists.txt.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README - ReadMe file to be embedded
in the installer. It typically describes in some detail the
purpose of the project during the installation. Not all
CPack generators uses this file.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME - Welcome file to be
embedded in the installer. It welcomes users to this
installer. Typically used in the graphical installers on
Windows and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL - Disables the component-based
installation mechanism. When set the component specification
is ignored and all installed items are put in a single
&quot;MONOLITHIC&quot; package. Some CPack generators do
monolithic packaging by default and may be asked to do
component packaging by setting
CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL to 1/TRUE.</p>

<p>CPACK_GENERATOR - List of CPack generators to use. If
not specified, CPack will create a set of options
CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt; (e.g., CPACK_BINARY_NSIS)
allowing the user to enable/disable individual generators.
This variable may be used on the command line as well as
in:</p>

<p>cpack -D CPACK_GENERATOR=&quot;ZIP;TGZ&quot;
/path/to/build/tree</p>

<p>CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack binary
configuration file. This file is the CPack configuration
generated by the CPack module for binary installers.
Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES - Lists each of the
executables and associated text label to be used to create
Start Menu shortcuts. For example, setting this to the list
ccmake;CMake will create a shortcut named &quot;CMake&quot;
that will execute the installed executable ccmake. Not all
CPack generators use it (at least NSIS and OSXX11 do).</p>

<p>CPACK_STRIP_FILES - List of files to be stripped.
Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a
boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a
list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is
compatible).</p>

<p>The following CPack variables are specific to source
packages, and will not affect binary packages:</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME - The name of the source
package. For example cmake-2.6.1.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES - List of files in the source
tree that will be stripped. Starting with CMake 2.6.0
CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which
enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to
TRUE in CMake, so this change is compatible).</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR - List of generators used for the
source packages. As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not
specified then CPack will create a set of options (e.g.,
CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP) allowing users to select which packages
will be generated.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE - The name of the CPack
source configuration file. This file is the CPack
configuration generated by the CPack module for source
installers. Defaults to CPackSourceConfig.cmake.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES - Pattern of files in the
source tree that wont be packaged when building a source
package. This is a list of regular expression patterns (that
must be properly escaped), e.g.,
/CVS/;/\.svn/;\.swp$;\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*</p>

<p>The following variables are for advanced uses of
CPack:</p>

<p>CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR - What CMake generator should be
used if the project is CMake project. Defaults to the value
of CMAKE_GENERATOR few users will want to change this
setting.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS - List of four values that
specify what project to install. The four values are: Build
directory, Project Name, Project Component, Directory. If
omitted, CPack will build an installer that installers
everything.</p>

<p>CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME - System name, defaults to the value
of ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION - Package full version, used
internally. By default, this is built from
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR, CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR,
and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.</p>

<p>CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG - Directory for the installed
files.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra commands to install
components.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES - Extra directories to
install.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY - Registry key used
when installing this project. This is only used by installer
for Windows. The default value is based on the installation
directory. CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS - List of desktop
links to create.</p>

<p>CPackBundle CPack Bundle generator (Mac OS X) specific
options</p>

<p>Installers built on Mac OS X using the Bundle generator
use the aforementioned DragNDrop (CPACK_DMG_xxx) variables,
plus the following Bundle-specific parameters
(CPACK_BUNDLE_xxx).</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_NAME - The name of the generated bundle.
This appears in the OSX finder as the bundle name.
Required.</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_PLIST - Path to an OSX plist file that will
be used for the generated bundle. This assumes that the
caller has generated or specified their own Info.plist file.
Required.</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_ICON - Path to an OSX icon file that will
be used as the icon for the generated bundle. This is the
icon that appears in the OSX finder for the bundle, and in
the OSX dock when the bundle is opened. Required.</p>

<p>CPACK_BUNDLE_STARTUP_COMMAND - Path to a startup script.
This is a path to an executable or script that will be run
whenever an end-user double-clicks the generated bundle in
the OSX Finder. Optional.</p>

<p>CPackComponent Build binary and source package
installers</p>

<p>The CPackComponent module is the module which handles
the compo- nent part of CPack. See CPack module for general
information about CPack.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of binary installers (including the
graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack
generates installers that allow users to select individual
application components to install. The contents of each of
the components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of
CMake s INSTALL command. These com- ponents can be annotated
with user-friendly names and descrip- tions, inter-component
dependencies, etc., and grouped in vari- ous ways to
customize the resulting installer. See the cpack_add_*
commands, described below, for more information about
component-specific installations.</p>

<p>Component-specific installation allows users to select
specific sets of components to install during the install
process. Installation components are identified by the
COMPONENT argument of CMake s INSTALL commands, and should
be further described by the following CPack commands:</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL - The list of component to
install.</p>

<p>The default value of this variable is computed by CPack
and con- tains all components defined by the project. The
user may set it to only include the specified
components.</p>

<p>CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL - Enable/Disable
component install for CPack generator &lt;GENNAME&gt;.</p>

<p>Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG,
etc...) has a legacy default behavior. e.g. RPM builds
monolithic whereas NSIS builds component. One can change the
default behavior by setting this variable to 0/1 or
OFF/ON.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING - Specify how components are
grouped for multi-package component-aware CPack
generators.</p>

<p>Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP,
...) gen- erates several packages files when asked for
component packaging. They group the component differently
depending on the value of this variable:</p>

<p>- ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per
component group - ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single
package with all (requested) component - IGNORE : creates
one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group</p>

<p>One can specify different grouping for different CPack
generator by using a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DISPLAY_NAME - The name
to be displayed for a component.
CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION - The
description of a component.
CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_GROUP - The group of a
component. CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DEPENDS - The
dependencies (list of components) on which this component
depends. CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_REQUIRED - True is
this component is required.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component - Describes a CPack installation
component named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL
command.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component(compname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
[GROUP group] [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ] [INSTALL_TYPES
type1 type2 ... ] [DOWNLOADED] [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])</p>

<p>The cmake_add_component command describes an
installation compo- nent, which the user can opt to install
or remove as part of the graphical installation process.
compname is the name of the com- ponent, as provided to the
COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
commands.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component,
used in graphical installers to display the component name.
This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component,
used in graphical installers to give the user additional
information about the component. Descriptions can span
multiple lines using &quot;0 as the line separator.
Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few
lines long.</p>

<p>HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in
the graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly
change whether it is installed or not.</p>

<p>REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and
there- fore will always be installed. It will be visible in
the graphi- cal installer, but it cannot be unselected.
(Typically, required components are shown greyed out).</p>

<p>DISABLED indicates that this component should be
disabled (unse- lected) by default. The user is free to
select this component for installation, unless it is also
HIDDEN.</p>

<p>DEPENDS lists the components on which this component
depends. If this component is selected, then each of the
components listed must also be selected. The dependency
information is encoded within the installer itself, so that
users cannot install incon- sistent sets of components.</p>

<p>GROUP names the component group of which this component
is a part. If not provided, the component will be a
standalone compo- nent, not part of any component group.
Component groups are described with the
cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.</p>

<p>INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this
compo- nent is a part. When one of these installations types
is selected, this component will automatically be selected.
Instal- lation types are described with the
cpack_add_install_type com- mand, detailed below.</p>

<p>DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be
downloaded on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged
in with the installer itself. For more information, see the
cpack_config- ure_downloads command.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file
created by CPack to be used for downloaded components. If
not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based
on CPACK_PACK- AGE_FILE_NAME and the name of the component.
See cpack_config- ure_downloads for more information.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group - Describes a group of related
CPack installation components.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group(groupname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [PARENT_GROUP parent] [EXPANDED]
[BOLD_TITLE])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of
installation components, which will be placed together
within the listing of options. Typically, component groups
allow the user to select/deselect all of the components
within a single group via a single group-level option. Use
component groups to reduce the complexity of installers with
many options. groupname is an arbitrary name used to
identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a
component in a group. The name of the group must not
conflict with the name of any component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component
group, used in graphical installers to display the component
group name. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component
group, used in graphical installers to give the user
additional infor- mation about the components within that
group. Descriptions can span multiple lines using &quot;0 as
the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be
no more than a few lines long.</p>

<p>PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of
this group. Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy
of groups, pro- viding an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.</p>

<p>EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should
show up as &quot;expanded&quot;, so that the user
immediately sees all of the compo- nents within the group.
Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a single
entry.</p>

<p>BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear
in bold, to call the users attention to the group.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type - Add a new installation type
containing a set of predefined component selections to the
graphical installer.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type(typename [DISPLAY_NAME name])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of
prese- lected components that represents a common use case
for an application. For example, a &quot;Developer&quot;
install type might include an application along with its
header and library files, while an &quot;End user&quot;
install type might just include the applica- tion s
executable. Each component identifies itself with one or
more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to
cpack_add_component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type,
which will typically show up in a drop-down box within a
graphical installer. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads - Configure CPack to download
selected components on-the-fly as part of the installation
process.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads(site [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY
dirname] [ALL] [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])</p>

<p>The cpack_configure_downloads command configures
installa- tion-time downloads of selected components. For
each downloadable component, CPack will create an archive
containing the contents of that component, which should be
uploaded to the given site. When the user selects that
component for installa- tion, the installer will download
and extract the component in place. This feature is useful
for creating small installers that only download the
requested components, saving bandwidth. Addi- tionally, the
installers are small enough that they will be installed as
part of the normal installation process, and the
&quot;Change&quot; button in Windows Add/Remove Programs
control panel will allow one to add or remove parts of the
application after the original installation. On Windows, the
downloaded-components functionality requires the ZipDLL
plug-in for NSIS, available at:</p>

<p>http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in</p>

<p>On Mac OS X, installers that download components
on-the-fly can only be built and installed on system using
Mac OS X 10.5 or later.</p>

<p>The site argument is a URL where the archives for
downloadable components will reside, e.g.,
http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the
archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that
location.</p>

<p>UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will
create the various archives for each of the components. The
contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location
accessible by the URL given in the site argument. If
omitted, CPack will use the directory CPackUploads inside
the CMake binary directory to store the generated
archives.</p>

<p>The ALL flag indicates that all components be
downloaded. Other- wise, only those components explicitly
marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE
will be downloaded. Addition- ally, the ALL option implies
ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).</p>

<p>ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of
the installer that can be called from Windows Add/Remove
Programs dialog (via the &quot;Modify&quot; button) to
change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE turns
off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>CPackCygwin Cygwin CPack generator (Cygwin).</p>

<p>The following variable is specific to installers build
on and/or for Cygwin:</p>

<p>CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_NUMBER - The Cygwin patch number.
FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.
CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_FILE - The Cygwin patch file. FIXME: This
documentation is incomplete. CPACK_CYGWIN_BUILD_SCRIPT - The
Cygwin build script. FIXME: This documentation is
incomplete.</p>

<p>CPackDMG DragNDrop CPack generator (Mac OS X).</p>

<p>The following variables are specific to the DragNDrop
installers built on Mac OS X:</p>

<p>CPACK_DMG_VOLUME_NAME - The volume name of the generated
disk image. Defaults to CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME.</p>

<p>CPACK_DMG_FORMAT - The disk image format. Common values
are UDRO (UDIF read-only), UDZO (UDIF zlib-compressed) or
UDBZ (UDIF bzip2-compressed). Refer to hdiutil(1) for more
information on other available formats.</p>

<p>CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE - Path to a custom DS_Store file.
This .DS_Store file e.g. can be used to specify the Finder
window position/geometry and layout (such as hidden
toolbars, placement of the icons etc.). This file has to be
generated by the Finder (either manually or through
OSA-script) using a normal folder from which the .DS_Store
file can then be extracted.</p>

<p>CPACK_DMG_BACKGROUND_IMAGE - Path to a background image
file. This file will be used as the background for the
Finder Window when the disk image is opened. By default no
background image is set. The background image is applied
after applying the custom .DS_Store file.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMMAND_HDIUTIL - Path to the hdiutil(1) command
used to operate on disk image files on Mac OS X. This
variable can be used to override the automatically detected
command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails
to find it.)</p>

<p>CPACK_COMMAND_SETFILE - Path to the SetFile(1) command
used to set extended attributes on files and directories on
Mac OS X. This variable can be used to override the
automatically detected command (or specify its location if
the auto-detection fails to find it.)</p>

<p>CPACK_COMMAND_REZ - Path to the Rez(1) command used to
compile resources on Mac OS X. This variable can be used to
override the automatically detected command (or specify its
location if the auto-detection fails to find it.)</p>

<p>CPackDeb The builtin (binary) CPack Deb generator (Unix
only)</p>

<p>CPackDeb may be used to create Deb package using CPack.
CPackDeb is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX
variables used by CPack :
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration. CPackDeb
generator should work on any linux host but it will produce
better deb package when Debian specific tools dpkg-xxx are
usable on the build system.</p>

<p>CPackDeb has specific features which are controlled by
the specifics CPACK_DEBIAN_XXX variables.Youll find a

<p>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : OFF May be set to ON in order
to use dpkg-shlibdeps to generate better package dependency
list. You may need set CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH toi appropriate
value if you use this feature, because if you don t
dpkg-shlibdeps may fail to find your own shared libs. See
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_RPATH_handling.</p>

starting the installation of the package which declares the
pre-dependency.</p>

<p>CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ENHANCES</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : - see
http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

<p>CPackNSIS CPack NSIS generator specific options</p>

<p>The following variables are specific to the graphical
installers built on Windows using the Nullsoft Installation
System.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_INSTALL_ROOT - The default installation
directory presented to the end user by the NSIS installer is
under this root dir. The full directory presented to the end
user is:
${CPACK_NSIS_INSTALL_ROOT}/${CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY}</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_MUI_ICON - An icon filename. The name of a
*.ico file used as the main icon for the generated install

your install tree is available on the target system.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_EXTRA_UNINSTALL_COMMANDS - Extra NSIS
commands that will be added to the uninstall Section, before
your install tree is removed from the target system.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_COMPRESSOR - The arguments that will be
passed to the NSIS SetCompressor command.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_ENABLE_UNINSTALL_BEFORE_INSTALL - Ask about
uninstalling previous versions first. If this is set to
&quot;ON&quot;, then an installer will look for previous
installed versions and if one is found, ask the user whether
to uninstall it before proceeding with the install.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_MODIFY_PATH - Modify PATH toggle. If this is
set to &quot;ON&quot;, then an extra page will appear in the
installer that will allow the user to choose whether the
program directory should be added to the system PATH
variable.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_DISPLAY_NAME - The display name string that
appears in the Windows Add/Remove Program control panel</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_PACKAGE_NAME - The title displayed at the top
of the installer.</p>

to uninstall start menu shortcuts.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_EXECUTABLES_DIRECTORY - Creating NSIS start
menu links assumes that they are in bin unless this variable
is set. For example, you would set this to exec if your
executables are in an exec directory.</p>

<p>CPACK_NSIS_MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN - Specify an executable to
add an option to run on the finish page of the NSIS
installer. CPACK_NSIS_MENU_LINKS - Specify links in
[application] menu. This should contain a list of pair
&quot;link&quot; &quot;link name&quot;. The link may be an
URL or a path relative to installation prefix. Like:
set(CPACK_NSIS_MENU_LINKS
&quot;doc/cmake-@CMake_VERSION_MAJOR@.@CMake_VERSION_MINOR@/cmake.html&quot;
&quot;CMake Help&quot; &quot;http://www.cmake.org&quot;
&quot;CMake Web Site&quot;)</p>

<p>CPackPackageMaker PackageMaker CPack generator (Mac OS
X).</p>

<p>The following variable is specific to installers built
on Mac OS X using PackageMaker:</p>

<p>CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION - The version of Mac OS X that
the resulting PackageMaker archive should be compatible
with. Different versions of Mac OS X support different
features. For example, CPack can only build component-based
installers for Mac OS X 10.4 or newer, and can only build
installers that download component son-the-fly for Mac OS X
10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the
minimum version of Mac OS X that supports the requested
features. Set this variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only
if you want to guarantee that your installer will work on
that version of Mac OS X, and dont mind missing extra
features available in the installer shipping with later
versions of Mac OS X.</p>

<p>CPackRPM The builtin (binary) CPack RPM generator (Unix
only)</p>

<p>CPackRPM may be used to create RPM package using CPack.
CPackRPM is a CPack generator thus it uses the CPACK_XXX
variables used by CPack :
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackConfiguration</p>

<p>However CPackRPM has specific features which are
controlled by the specifics CPACK_RPM_XXX variables.
CPackRPM is a component aware generator so when
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is ON some more
CPACK_RPM_&lt;ComponentName&gt;_XXXX variables may be used
in order to have component specific values. Note however
that &lt;com- ponentName&gt; refers to the **grouping
name**. This may be either a component name or a component
GROUP name. Usually those vars correspond to RPM spec file
entities, one may find information about spec files here
http://www.rpm.org/wiki/Docs. Youll find a detailed usage of
CPackRPM on the wiki:</p>


<p>http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators#RPM_.28Unix_Only.29</p>

<p>However as a handy reminder here comes the list of
specific variables:</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY - The RPM package summary.
Mandatory : YES Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME - The RPM package name. Mandatory :
YES Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION -
The RPM package version. Mandatory : YES Default :
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE - The
RPM package architecture. Mandatory : NO Default : - This
may be set to &quot;noarch&quot; if you know you are
building a noarch package. CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE - The
RPM package release. Mandatory : YES Default : 1 This is the
numbering of the RPM package itself, i.e. the version of the
packaging and not the version of the content (see
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION). One may change the default value
if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put
here a fancy Linux distro specific numbering.
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE - The RPM package license policy.
Mandatory : YES Default : &quot;unknown&quot;
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_GROUP - The RPM package group. Mandatory :
YES Default : &quot;unknown&quot; CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VENDOR -
The RPM package vendor. Mandatory : YES Default :
CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR if set or &quot;unknown&quot;
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_URL - The projects URL. Mandatory : NO
Default : - CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION - RPM package
description. Mandatory : YES Default :
CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE if set or &quot;no package
description available&quot; CPACK_RPM_COMPRESSION_TYPE - RPM
compression type. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to
override RPM compression type to be used to build the RPM.
For example some Linux distribution now default to lzma or
xz compression whereas older cannot use such RPM. Using this
one can enforce compression type to be used. Possible value
are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip. CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES -
RPM spec requires field. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be
used to set RPM dependencies (requires). Note that you must
enclose the complete requires string between quotes, for
example: set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES &quot;python &gt;=
2.5.0, cmake &gt;= 2.8&quot;) The required package list of
an RPM file could be printed with rpm -qp --requires
file.rpm CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS - RPM spec suggest
field. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to set weak
RPM dependencies (suggests). Note that you must enclose the
complete requires string between quotes.
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_PROVIDES - RPM spec provides field.
Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to set RPM
dependencies (provides). The provided package list of an RPM
file could be printed with rpm -qp --provides file.rpm
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_OBSOLETES - RPM spec obsoletes field.
Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to set RPM packages
that are obsoleted by this one.
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE - build a relocatable RPM.
Mandatory : NO Default : CPACK_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE If this
variable is set to TRUE or ON CPackRPM will try to build a
relocatable RPM package. A relocatable RPM may be installed
using rpm --prefix or --relocate in order to install it at
an alternate place see rpm(8). Note that currently this may
fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON. If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR
is set then you will get a warning message but if there is
file installed with absolute path youll get unexpected
behavior. CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST - [deprecated].
Mandatory : NO Default : - This way of specifying
post-install script is deprecated use
CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE May be used to set an RPM
post-install command inside the spec file. For example
setting it to &quot;/bin/true&quot; may be used to prevent
rpmbuild to strip binaries. CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE - RPM
extended spec definitions lines. Mandatory : NO Default : -
May be used to add any %define lines to the generated spec
file. CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG - Toggle CPackRPM debug
output. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be set when invoking
cpack in order to trace debug information during CPack RPM
run. For example you may launch CPack like this cpack -D
CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 -G RPM
CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE - A user provided spec file.
Mandatory : NO Default : - May be set by the user in order
to specify a USER binary spec file to be used by CPackRPM
instead of generating the file. The specified file will be
processed by configure_file( @ONLY). One can provide a
component specific file by setting
CPACK_RPM_&lt;componentName&gt;_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.
CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE - Spec file
template. Mandatory : NO Default : - If set CPack will
generate a template for USER specified binary spec file and
stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this cpack
-D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM
The user may then use this file in order to hand-craft is
own binary spec file which may be used with
CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.
CPACK_RPM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
CPACK_RPM_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE Mandatory : NO Default :
- May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the
spec file. The refered script file(s) will be read and
directly put after the %pre or %preun section If
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install
script for each component can be overridden with
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE One
may verify which scriptlet has been included with rpm -qp
--scripts package.rpm CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
CPACK_RPM_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE Mandatory : NO Default
: - May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in
the spec file. The refered script file(s) will be read and
directly put after the %post or %postun section If
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install
script for each component can be overridden with
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE One
may verify which scriptlet has been included with rpm -qp
--scripts package.rpm CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST Mandatory : NO
Default : - May be used to explicitly specify
%(&lt;directive&gt;) file line in the spec file. Like
%config(noreplace) or any other directive that be found in
the %files section. Since CPackRPM is generating the list of
files (and directories) the user specified files of the
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST list will be
removed from the generated list. CPACK_RPM_CHANGELOG_FILE -
RPM changelog file. Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used
to embed a changelog in the spec file. The refered file will
be read and directly put after the %changelog section.
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST - list of path to be
excluded. Mandatory : NO Default : /etc /etc/init.d /usr
/usr/share /usr/share/doc /usr/bin /usr/lib /usr/lib64
/usr/include May be used to exclude path (directories or
files) from the auto-generated list of paths discovered by
CPack RPM. The defaut value contains a reasonable set of
values if the variable is not defined by the user. If the
variable is defined by the user then CPackRPM will NOT any
of the default path. If you want to add some path to the
default list then you can use
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION variable.
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION - additional
list of path to be excluded. Mandatory : NO Default : - May
be used to add more exclude path (directories or files) from
the initial default list of excluded paths. See
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST.</p>

<p>CPackWIX CPack WiX generator specific options</p>

<p>The following variables are specific to the installers
built on Windows using WiX.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID - Upgrade GUID
(Product/@UpgradeCode)</p>

<p>Will be automatically generated unless explicitly
provided.</p>

<p>It should be explicitly set to a constant generated
gloabally unique identifier (GUID) to allow your installers
to replace existing installations that use the same
GUID.</p>

<p>You may for example explicitly set this variable in your
CMake- Lists.txt to the value that has been generated per
default. You should not use GUIDs that you did not generate
yourself or which may belong to other projects.</p>

<p>A GUID shall have the following fixed length syntax:
XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p>(each X represents an uppercase hexadecimal digit)
CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_GUID - Product GUID (Product/@Id)</p>

<p>Will be automatically generated unless explicitly
provided.</p>

<p>If explicitly provided this will set the Product Id of
your installer.</p>

<p>The installer will abort if it detects a pre-existing
installa- tion that uses the same GUID.</p>

<p>The GUID shall use the syntax described for
CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF - RTF License File</p>

<p>If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .rtf extension it
is used as-is.</p>

<p>If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .txt extension it
is implicitly converted to RTF by the WiX Generator.</p>

<p>With CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF you can override the license
file used by the WiX Generator in case
CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE is in an unsupported format or
the .txt -&gt; .rtf conversion does not work as
expected.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_ICON - The Icon shown next to the
program name in Add/Remove programs.</p>

<p>If set, this icon is used in place of the default
icon.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UI_BANNER - The bitmap will appear at the top
of all installer pages other than the welcome and completion
dialogs.</p>

<p>If set, this image will replace the default banner
image.</p>

<p>This image must be 493 by 58 pixels.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UI_DIALOG - Background bitmap used on the
welcome and completion dialogs.</p>

<p>If this variable is set, the installer will replace the
default dialog image.</p>

<p>This image must be 493 by 312 pixels.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_PROGRAM_MENU_FOLDER - Start menu folder name
for launcher.</p>

<p>If this variable is not set, it will be initialized with
CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_CULTURES - Language(s) of the installer</p>

<p>Languages are compiled into the WixUI extension library.
To use them, simply provide the name of the culture. If you
specify more than one culture identifier in a comma or
semicolon delim- ited list, the first one that is found will
be used. You can find a list of supported languages at:
http://wix.source-
forge.net/manual-wix3/WixUI_localization.htm</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_TEMPLATE - Template file for WiX
generation</p>

<p>If this variable is set, the specified template will be
used to generate the WiX wxs file. This should be used if
further cus- tomization of the output is required.</p>

<p>If this variable is not set, the default MSI template
included with CMake will be used.</p>

<p>CTest Configure a project for testing with
CTest/CDash</p>

<p>Include this module in the top CMakeLists.txt file of a
project to enable testing with CTest and dashboard
submissions to CDash:</p>

<p>project(MyProject) ... include(CTest)</p>

<p>The module automatically creates a BUILD_TESTING option
that selects whether to enable testing support (ON by
default). After including the module, use code like</p>

<p>if(BUILD_TESTING) # ... CMake code to create tests ...
endif()</p>

<p>to creating tests when testing is enabled.</p>

<p>To enable submissions to a CDash server, create a
CTestCon- fig.cmake file at the top of the project with
content such as</p>

<p>set(CTEST_PROJECT_NAME &quot;MyProject&quot;)
set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME &quot;01:00:00 UTC&quot;)
set(CTEST_DROP_METHOD &quot;http&quot;) set(CTEST_DROP_SITE
&quot;my.cdash.org&quot;) set(CTEST_DROP_LOCATION
&quot;/submit.php?project=MyProject&quot;)
set(CTEST_DROP_SITE_CDASH TRUE)</p>

<p>(the CDash server can provide the file to a project
administra- tor who configures MyProject ). Settings in the
config file are shared by both this CTest module and the
CTest command-line tools dashboard script mode (ctest
-S).</p>

<p>While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest
scans the build output for errors and warnings and reports
them with surrounding context from the build log. This
generic approach works for all build tools, but does not
give details about the command invocation that produced a
given problem. One may get more detailed reports by
adding</p>

<p>set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)</p>

<p>to the CTestConfig.cmake file. When this option is
enabled, the CTest module tells CMakes Makefile generators
to invoke every command in the generated build system
through a CTest launcher program. (Currently the
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS option is ignored on non-Makefile
generators.) During a manual build each launcher
transparently runs the command it wraps. During a
CTest-driven build for submission to CDash each launcher
reports detailed information when its command fails or
warns. (Setting CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS in CTestConfig.cmake is
convenient, but also adds the launcher overhead even for
manual builds. One may instead set it in a CTest dashboard
script and add it to the CMake cache for the build
tree.)</p>

<p>CTestScriptMode</p>

<p>This file is read by ctest in script mode (-S)</p>

<p>CTestUseLaunchers Set the RULE_LAUNCH_* global
properties when CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on.</p>

<p>CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you
include(CTest). However, it is split out into its own module
file so projects can use the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS
functionality independently.</p>

<p>To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a
ctest -S dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache
of the con- figured project. Both cmake and ctest need to
know the value of it for the launchers to work properly.
CMake needs to know in order to generate proper build rules,
and ctest, in order to produce the proper error and warning
analysis.</p>

<p>For convenience, you may set the ENV variable
CTEST_USE_LAUNCH- ERS_DEFAULT in your ctest -S script, too.
Then, as long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or
include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the ENV
variable to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable.
This cache variable initial- ization only occurs if
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not already defined.</p>

<p>CheckCCompilerFlag Check whether the C compiler supports
a given flag.</p>

<p>CHECK_C_COMPILER_FLAG(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;var&gt;)</p>

<p>&lt;flag&gt; - the compiler flag &lt;var&gt; - variable
to store the result</p>

<p>This internally calls the check_c_source_compiles macro
and sets CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS to &lt;flag&gt;. See
help for CheckCSource- Compiles for a listing of variables
that can otherwise modify the build. The result only tells
that the compiler does not give an error message when it
encounters the flag. If the flag has any effect or even a
specific one is beyond the scope of this module.</p>

<p>CheckCSourceCompiles Check if given C source compiles
and links into an executable</p>

<p>CHECK_C_SOURCE_COMPILES(&lt;code&gt; &lt;var&gt;
[FAIL_REGEX &lt;fail-regex&gt;])</p>

<p>&lt;code&gt; - source code to try to compile, must
define main &lt;var&gt; - variable to store whether the
source code compiled &lt;fail-regex&gt; - fail if test
output matches this regex</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckCSourceRuns Check if the given C source code
compiles and runs.</p>

<p>CHECK_C_SOURCE_RUNS(&lt;code&gt; &lt;var&gt;)</p>

<p>&lt;code&gt; - source code to try to compile &lt;var&gt;
- variable to store the result (1 for success, empty for
failure)</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckCXXCompilerFlag Check whether the CXX compiler
supports a given flag.</p>

<p>CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG(&lt;flag&gt; &lt;var&gt;)</p>

<p>&lt;flag&gt; - the compiler flag &lt;var&gt; - variable
to store the result</p>

<p>This internally calls the check_cxx_source_compiles
macro and sets CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS to &lt;flag&gt;.
See help for Check- CXXSourceCompiles for a listing of
variables that can otherwise modify the build. The result
only tells that the compiler does not give an error message
when it encounters the flag. If the flag has any effect or
even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.</p>

<p>CheckCXXSourceCompiles Check if given C++ source
compiles and links into an executable</p>

<p>CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_COMPILES(&lt;code&gt; &lt;var&gt;
[FAIL_REGEX &lt;fail-regex&gt;])</p>

<p>&lt;code&gt; - source code to try to compile, must
define main &lt;var&gt; - variable to store whether the
source code compiled &lt;fail-regex&gt; - fail if test
output matches this regex</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckCXXSourceRuns Check if the given C++ source code
compiles and runs.</p>

<p>CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_RUNS(&lt;code&gt; &lt;var&gt;)</p>

<p>&lt;code&gt; - source code to try to compile &lt;var&gt;
- variable to store the result (1 for success, empty for
failure)</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to

<p>CheckCXXSymbolExists Check if a symbol exists as a
function, variable, or macro in C++</p>

<p>CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt;
&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check that the &lt;symbol&gt; is available after
including given header &lt;files&gt; and store the result in
a &lt;variable&gt;. Specify the list of files in one
argument as a semicolon-separated list.
CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS() can be used to check in C++ files,
as opposed to CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which works only for
C.</p>

<p>If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is
consid- ered available and assumed to work. If the header
files declare the symbol as a function or variable then the
symbol must also be available for linking. If the symbol is
a type or enum value it will not be recognized (consider
using CheckTypeSize or CheckCSourceCompiles).</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckFortranFunctionExists macro which checks if the
Fortran function exists</p>

<p>CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS(FUNCTION VARIABLE)</p>

<p>FUNCTION - the name of the Fortran function VARIABLE -
variable to store the result</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link</p>

<p>CheckFunctionExists Check if a C function can be
linked</p>

<p>CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS(&lt;function&gt;
&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check that the &lt;function&gt; is provided by libraries
on the system and store the result in a &lt;variable&gt;.
This does not verify that any system header file declares
the function, only that it can be found at link time
(consider using CheckSymbolExists).</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

exists.</p>

<p>CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE(INCLUDE VARIABLE)</p>

<p>INCLUDE - name of include file VARIABLE - variable to
return result</p>

<p>an optional third argument is the CFlags to add to the

flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories</p>

<p>CheckLanguage Check if a language can be enabled</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>check_language(&lt;lang&gt;)</p>

<p>where &lt;lang&gt; is a language that may be passed to
enable_lan- guage() such as &quot;Fortran&quot;. If
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER is already defined the check
does nothing. Otherwise it tries enabling the language in a
test project. The result is cached in
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER as the compiler that was found,
or NOT- FOUND if the language cannot be enabled.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>check_language(Fortran) if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)
enable_language(Fortran) else() message(STATUS &quot;No
Fortran support&quot;) endif()</p>

<p>CheckLibraryExists Check if the function exists.</p>

<p>CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS (LIBRARY FUNCTION LOCATION
VARIABLE)</p>

<p>LIBRARY - the name of the library you are looking for
FUNCTION - the name of the function LOCATION - location
where the library should be found VARIABLE - variable to
store the result</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckPrototypeDefinition Check if the protoype we expect
is correct.</p>

<p>check_prototype_definition(FUNCTION PROTOTYPE RETURN
HEADER VARIABLE)</p>

<p>FUNCTION - The name of the function (used to check if
prototype exists) PROTOTYPE- The prototype to check. RETURN
- The return value of the function. HEADER - The header
files required. VARIABLE - The variable to store the
result.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>check_prototype_definition(getpwent_r &quot;struct
passwd *getpwent_r(struct passwd *src, char *buf, int
buflen)&quot; &quot;NULL&quot; &quot;unistd.h;pwd.h&quot;
SOLARIS_GETPWENT_R)</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckStructHasMember Check if the given struct or class
has the specified member variable</p>

<p>CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER (STRUCT MEMBER HEADER
VARIABLE)</p>

<p>STRUCT - the name of the struct or class you are
interested in MEMBER - the member which existence you want
to check HEADER - the header(s) where the prototype should
be declared VARIABLE - variable to store the result</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories</p>

<p>Example: CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER(&quot;struct
timeval&quot; tv_sec sys/select.h HAVE_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC)</p>

<p>CheckSymbolExists Check if a symbol exists as a
function, variable, or macro</p>

<p>CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(&lt;symbol&gt; &lt;files&gt;
&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check that the &lt;symbol&gt; is available after
including given header &lt;files&gt; and store the result in
a &lt;variable&gt;. Specify the list of files in one
argument as a semicolon-separated list.</p>

<p>If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is
consid- ered available and assumed to work. If the header
files declare the symbol as a function or variable then the
symbol must also be available for linking. If the symbol is
a type or enum value it will not be recognized (consider
using CheckTypeSize or CheckCSourceCompiles). If the check
needs to be done in C++, consider using
CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which does the same as
CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), but in C++.</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>CheckTypeSize Check sizeof a type</p>

<p>CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(TYPE VARIABLE [BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY])</p>

<p>Check if the type exists and determine its size. On
return, &quot;HAVE_${VARIABLE}&quot; holds the existence of
the type, and &quot;${VARI- ABLE}&quot; holds one of the
following:</p>

<p>&lt;size&gt; = type has non-zero size &lt;size&gt;
&quot;0&quot; = type has arch-dependent size (see below)
&quot;&quot; = type does not exist</p>

<p>Furthermore, the variable &quot;${VARIABLE}_CODE&quot;
holds C preproces- sor code to define the macro
&quot;${VARIABLE}&quot; to the size of the type, or leave
the macro undefined if the type does not exist.</p>

<p>The variable &quot;${VARIABLE}&quot; may be
&quot;0&quot; when CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITEC- TURES has multiple
architectures for building OS X universal binaries. This
indicates that the type size varies across archi- tectures.
In this case &quot;${VARIABLE}_CODE&quot; contains C
preproces- sor tests mapping from each architecture macro to
the corre- sponding type size. The list of architecture
macros is stored in &quot;${VARIABLE}_KEYS&quot;, and the
value for each key is stored in
&quot;${VARIABLE}-${KEY}&quot;.</p>

<p>If the BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY option is not given, the macro
checks for headers &lt;sys/types.h&gt;, &lt;stdint.h&gt;,
and &lt;stddef.h&gt;, and saves results in HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H,
HAVE_STDINT_H, and HAVE_STDDEF_H. The type size check
automatically includes the available head- ers, thus
supporting checks of types defined in the headers.</p>

<p>Despite the name of the macro you may use it to check
the size of more complex expressions, too. To check e.g. for
the size of a struct member you can do something like
this:</p>

<p>check_type_size(&quot;((struct
something*)0)-&gt;member&quot; SIZEOF_MEMBER)</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include
directories CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES = list of extra headers to
include</p>

<p>CheckVariableExists Check if the variable exists.</p>

<p>CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS(VAR VARIABLE)</p>

<p>VAR - the name of the variable VARIABLE - variable to
store the result</p>

<p>This macro is only for C variables.</p>

<p>The following variables may be set before calling this
macro to modify the way the check is run:</p>

<p>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line
flags CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define
(-DFOO=bar) CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to
link</p>

<p>Dart Configure a project for testing with CTest or old
Dart Tcl Client</p>

<p>This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the
CTest module. It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client
for driving dashboard submissions as well as testing with
CTest. This mod- ule should be included in the
CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project. Typical
usage:</p>

<p>include(Dart) if(BUILD_TESTING) # ... testing related
CMake code ... endif()</p>

<p>The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module
to deter- mine whether testing support should be enabled.
The default is ON.</p>

<p>DeployQt4 Functions to help assemble a standalone Qt4
executable.</p>

<p>A collection of CMake utility functions useful for
deploying Qt4 executables.</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this module:</p>

<p>write_qt4_conf resolve_qt4_paths fixup_qt4_executable
install_qt4_plugin_path install_qt4_plugin
install_qt4_executable</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function
and PAR- ENT_SCOPE. Also depends on
BundleUtilities.cmake.</p>

<p>WRITE_QT4_CONF(&lt;qt_conf_dir&gt;
&lt;qt_conf_contents&gt;)</p>

<p>Writes a qt.conf file with the &lt;qt_conf_contents&gt;
into &lt;qt_conf_dir&gt;.</p>

<p>RESOLVE_QT4_PATHS(&lt;paths_var&gt;
[&lt;executable_path&gt;])</p>

<p>Loop through &lt;paths_var&gt; list and if any dont
exist resolve them relative to the &lt;executable_path&gt;
(if supplied) or the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>FIXUP_QT4_EXECUTABLE(&lt;executable&gt;
[&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt;])</p>

<p>Copies Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if
needed) and fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities
so it is standalone and can be drag-and-drop copied to
another machine as long as all of the system libraries are
compatible.</p>

<p>&lt;executable&gt; should point to the executable to be
fixed-up.</p>

<p>&lt;qtplugins&gt; should contain a list of the names or
paths of any Qt plugins to be installed.</p>

<p>&lt;libs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and
should be a list of any already installed plugins, libraries
or executables to also be fixed-up.</p>

<p>&lt;dirs&gt; will be passed to BundleUtilities and
should contain and directories to be searched to find
library dependencies.</p>

<p>&lt;plugins_dir&gt; allows an custom plugins directory
to be used.</p>

<p>&lt;request_qt_conf&gt; will force a qt.conf file to be
written even if not needed.</p>

<p>INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH(plugin executable copy
installed_plugin_path_var &lt;plugins_dir&gt;
&lt;component&gt; &lt;configurations&gt;)</p>

<p>Install (or copy) a resolved &lt;plugin&gt; to the
default plugins directory (or &lt;plugins_dir&gt;) relative
to &lt;executable&gt; and store the result in
&lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;.</p>

<p>If &lt;copy&gt; is set to TRUE then the plugins will be
copied rather than installed. This is to allow this module
to be used at CMake time rather than install time.</p>

<p>If &lt;component&gt; is set then anything installed will
use this COM- PONENT.</p>

<p>INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN(plugin executable copy
installed_plugin_path_var &lt;plugins_dir&gt;
&lt;component&gt;)</p>

<p>Install (or copy) an unresolved &lt;plugin&gt; to the
default plugins directory (or &lt;plugins_dir&gt;) relative
to &lt;executable&gt; and store the result in
&lt;installed_plugin_path_var&gt;. See documentation of
INSTALL_QT4_PLUGIN_PATH.</p>

<p>INSTALL_QT4_EXECUTABLE(&lt;executable&gt;
[&lt;qtplugins&gt; &lt;libs&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;
&lt;plugins_dir&gt; &lt;request_qt_conf&gt;
&lt;component&gt;])</p>

<p>Installs Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if
needed) and fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities
so it is standalone and can be drag-and-drop copied to
another machine as long as all of the system libraries are
compatible. The exe- cutable will be fixed-up at install
time. &lt;component&gt; is the COMPONENT used for bundle
fixup and plugin installation. See documentation of
FIXUP_QT4_BUNDLE.</p>

<p>Documentation DocumentationVTK.cmake</p>

<p>This file provides support for the VTK documentation
framework. It relies on several tools (Doxygen, Perl,
etc).</p>

<p>ExternalData Manage data files stored outside source
tree</p>

<p>Use this module to unambiguously reference data files
stored outside the source tree and fetch them at build time
from arbi- trary local and remote content-addressed
locations. Functions provided by this module recognize
arguments with the syntax &quot;DATA{&lt;name&gt;}&quot; as
references to external data, replace them with full paths to
local copies of those data, and create build rules to fetch
and update the local copies.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax is literal and the &lt;name&gt; is a
full or rela- tive path within the source tree. The source
tree must contain either a real data file at &lt;name&gt; or
a &quot;content link&quot; at &lt;name&gt;&lt;ext&gt;
containing a hash of the real file using a hash algorithm
corresponding to &lt;ext&gt;. For example, the argument
&quot;DATA{img.png}&quot; may be satisfied by either a real
&quot;img.png&quot; file in the current source directory or
a &quot;img.png.md5&quot; file contain- ing its MD5 sum.</p>

<p>The ExternalData_Expand_Arguments function evaluates
DATA{} references in its arguments and constructs a new list
of argu- ments:</p>

<p>ExternalData_Expand_Arguments( &lt;target&gt; # Name of
data management target &lt;outVar&gt; # Output variable
[args...] # Input arguments, DATA{} allowed )</p>

<p>It replaces each DATA{} reference in an argument with
the full path of a real data file on disk that will exist
after the &lt;tar- get&gt; builds.</p>

<p>The ExternalData_Add_Test function wraps around the
CMake add_test() command but supports DATA{} references in
its argu- ments:</p>

<p>ExternalData_Add_Test( &lt;target&gt; # Name of data
management target ... # Arguments of add_test(), DATA{}
allowed )</p>

<p>It passes its arguments through
ExternalData_Expand_Arguments and then invokes add_test()
using the results.</p>

<p>The ExternalData_Add_Target function creates a custom
target to manage local instances of data files stored
externally:</p>

<p>ExternalData_Add_Target( &lt;target&gt; # Name of data
management target )</p>

<p>It creates custom commands in the target as necessary to
make data files available for each DATA{} reference
previously evalu- ated by other functions provided by this
module. A list of URL templates must be provided in the
variable ExternalData_URL_TEM- PLATES using the placeholders
&quot;%(algo)&quot; and &quot;%(hash)&quot; in each
template. Data fetch rules try each URL template in order by
substituting the hash algorithm name for &quot;%(algo)&quot;
and the hash value for &quot;%(hash)&quot;.</p>

<p>The following hash algorithms are supported:</p>

<p>%(algo) &lt;ext&gt; Description ------- -----
----------- MD5 .md5 Message-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321
SHA1 .sha1 US Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174 SHA224
.sha224 US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634 SHA256 .sha256
US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634 SHA384 .sha384 US Secure
Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634 SHA512 .sha512 US Secure Hash
Algorithms, RFC 4634</p>

<p>Note that the hashes are used only for unique data
identifica- tion and download verification. This is not
security software.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>include(ExternalData) set(ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES
&quot;file:///local/%(algo)/%(hash)&quot;
&quot;http://data.org/%(algo)/%(hash)&quot;)
ExternalData_Add_Test(MyData NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe
DATA{MyInput.png} ) ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)</p>

<p>When test &quot;MyTest&quot; runs the
&quot;DATA{MyInput.png}&quot; argument will be replaced by
the full path to a real instance of the data file
&quot;MyInput.png&quot; on disk. If the source tree contains
a content link such as &quot;MyInput.png.md5&quot; then the
&quot;MyData&quot; target creates a real
&quot;MyInput.png&quot; in the build tree.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax can be told to fetch a file series
using the form &quot;DATA{&lt;name&gt;,:}&quot;, where the
&quot;:&quot; is literal. If the source tree contains a
group of files or content links named like a series then a
reference to one member adds rules to fetch all of them.
Although all members of a series are fetched, only the file
originally named by the DATA{} argument is substituted for
it. The default configuration recognizes file series names
end- ing with &quot;#.ext&quot;, &quot;_#.ext&quot;,
&quot;.#.ext&quot;, or &quot;-#.ext&quot; where
&quot;#&quot; is a sequence of decimal digits and
&quot;.ext&quot; is any single extension. Configure it with
a regex that parses &lt;number&gt; and &lt;suffix&gt; parts
from the end of &lt;name&gt;:</p>

<p>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form
(&lt;number&gt;)(&lt;suffix&gt;)$</p>

<p>For more complicated cases set:</p>

<p>ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex with at least two ()
groups ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX = &lt;prefix&gt;
regex group number, if any ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER
= &lt;number&gt; regex group number
ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX = &lt;suffix&gt; regex
group number</p>

<p>Configure series number matching with a regex that
matches the &lt;number&gt; part of series members named
&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;suffix&gt;:</p>

<p>ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH = regex matching
&lt;number&gt; in all series members</p>

<p>Note that the &lt;suffix&gt; of a series does not
include a hash-algo- rithm extension.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax can alternatively match files
associated with the named file and contained in the same
directory. Associated files may be specified by options
using the syntax
DATA{&lt;name&gt;,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...}. Each
option may specify one file by name or specify a regular
expression to match file names using the syntax
REGEX:&lt;regex&gt;. For example, the arguments</p>

<p>DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img} # File pair
DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0-9]+\.png} #
Series</p>

<p>will pass MyInput.mha and MyFrames00.png on the command
line but ensure that the associated files are present next
to them.</p>

<p>The DATA{} syntax may reference a directory using a
trailing slash and a list of associated files. The form
DATA{&lt;name&gt;/,&lt;opt1&gt;,&lt;opt2&gt;,...} adds rules
to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the
associated file options. For example, the argument
DATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*} will pass the full path to a
MyDataDir directory on the command line and ensure that the
directory contains files corresponding to every file or
content link in the MyDataDir source directory.</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT may be set to the
name of a supported hash algorithm to enable automatic
conversion of real data files referenced by the DATA{}
syntax into content links. For each such &lt;file&gt; a
content link named &quot;&lt;file&gt;&lt;ext&gt;&quot; is
created. The original file is renamed to the form
&quot;.Exter- nalData_&lt;algo&gt;_&lt;hash&gt;&quot; to
stage it for future transmission to one of the locations in
the list of URL templates (by means out- side the scope of
this module). The data fetch rule created for the content
link will use the staged object if it cannot be found using
any URL template.</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES may be set to a
list of local directories that store objects using the
layout &lt;dir&gt;/%(algo)/%(hash). These directories will
be searched first for a needed object. If the object is not
available in any store then it will be fetched remotely
using the URL templates and added to the first local store
listed. If no stores are specified the default is a location
inside the build tree.</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT may be set to the
highest source directory containing any path named by a
DATA{} refer- ence. The default is CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.
ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT and CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR must refer to
directories within a single source distribution (e.g. they
come together in one tarball).</p>

<p>The variable ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT may be set to the
direc- tory to hold the real data files named by expanded
DATA{} refer- ences. The default is CMAKE_BINARY_DIR. The
directory layout will mirror that of content links under
External- Data_SOURCE_ROOT.</p>

<p>Variables ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY and
ExternalData_TIME- OUT_ABSOLUTE set the download inactivity
and absolute timeouts, in seconds. The defaults are 60
seconds and 300 seconds, respectively. Set either timeout to
0 seconds to disable enforcement.</p>

<p>ExternalProject Create custom targets to build projects
in external trees</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Add function creates a custom target
to drive download, update/patch, configure, build, install
and test steps of an external project:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Add(&lt;name&gt; # Name for custom
target [DEPENDS projects...] # Targets on which the project
depends [PREFIX dir] # Root dir for entire project
[LIST_SEPARATOR sep] # Sep to be replaced by ; in cmd lines
[TMP_DIR dir] # Directory to store temporary files
[STAMP_DIR dir] # Directory to store step timestamps
#--Download step-------------- [DOWNLOAD_NAME fname] # File
name to store (if not end of URL) [DOWNLOAD_DIR dir] #
Directory to store downloaded files [DOWNLOAD_COMMAND
cmd...] # Command to download source tree [CVS_REPOSITORY
cvsroot] # CVSROOT of CVS repository [CVS_MODULE mod] #
Module to checkout from CVS repo [CVS_TAG tag] # Tag to

<p>The *_DIR options specify directories for the project,
with default directories computed as follows. If the PREFIX
option is given to ExternalProject_Add() or the EP_PREFIX
directory prop- erty is set, then an external project is
built and installed under the specified prefix:</p>

<p>TMP_DIR = &lt;prefix&gt;/tmp STAMP_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-stamp DOWNLOAD_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src SOURCE_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt; BINARY_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;/src/&lt;name&gt;-build INSTALL_DIR =
&lt;prefix&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the EP_BASE directory property is set then
compo- nents of an external project are stored under the
specified base:</p>

<p>TMP_DIR = &lt;base&gt;/tmp/&lt;name&gt; STAMP_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Stamp/&lt;name&gt; DOWNLOAD_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Download/&lt;name&gt; SOURCE_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Source/&lt;name&gt; BINARY_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Build/&lt;name&gt; INSTALL_DIR =
&lt;base&gt;/Install/&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>If no PREFIX, EP_PREFIX, or EP_BASE is specified then
the default is to set PREFIX to
&quot;&lt;name&gt;-prefix&quot;. Relative paths are
interpreted with respect to the build directory
corresponding to the source directory in which
ExternalProject_Add is invoked.</p>

<p>If SOURCE_DIR is explicitly set to an existing directory
the project will be built from it. Otherwise a download step
must be specified using one of the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND, CVS_*,
SVN_*, or URL options. The URL option may refer locally to a
directory or source tarball, or refer to a remote tarball
(e.g. http://.../src.tgz).</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Add_Step function adds a custom step
to an external project:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Add_Step(&lt;name&gt; &lt;step&gt; #
Names of project and custom step [COMMAND cmd...] # Command
line invoked by this step [COMMENT &quot;text...&quot;] #
Text printed when step executes [DEPENDEES steps...] # Steps
on which this step depends [DEPENDERS steps...] # Steps that
depend on this step [DEPENDS files...] # Files on which this
step depends [ALWAYS 1] # No stamp file, step always runs
[WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] # Working directory for command [LOG
1] # Wrap step in script to log output )</p>

<p>The command line, comment, and working directory of
every stan- dard and custom step is processed to replace
tokens &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;, &lt;BINARY_DIR&gt;,
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;, and &lt;TMP_DIR&gt; with corresponding
property values.</p>

<p>Any builtin step that specifies a
&quot;&lt;step&gt;_COMMAND cmd...&quot; or custom step that
specifies a &quot;COMMAND cmd...&quot; may specify addi-
tional command lines using the form &quot;COMMAND
cmd...&quot;. At build time the commands will be executed in
order and aborted if any one fails. For example:</p>

<p>... BUILD_COMMAND make COMMAND echo done ...</p>

<p>specifies to run &quot;make&quot; and then &quot;echo
done&quot; during the build step. Whether the current
working directory is preserved between commands is not
defined. Behavior of shell operators like
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; is not defined.</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Get_Property function retrieves
external project target properties:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Get_Property(&lt;name&gt; [prop1 [prop2
[...]]])</p>

<p>It stores property values in variables of the same name.
Prop- erty names correspond to the keyword argument names of
Exter- nalProject_Add.</p>

<p>The ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets function generates
custom targets for the steps listed:</p>

<p>ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(&lt;name&gt; [step1
[step2 [...]]])</p>

<p>If STEP_TARGETS is set then
ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets is automatically called at
the end of matching calls to External- Project_Add_Step.
Pass STEP_TARGETS explicitly to individual
ExternalProject_Add calls, or implicitly to all ExternalPro-
ject_Add calls by setting the directory property
EP_STEP_TAR- GETS.</p>

<p>If STEP_TARGETS is not set, clients may still manually
call ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets after calling
ExternalPro- ject_Add or ExternalProject_Add_Step.</p>

<p>This functionality is provided to make it easy to drive
the steps independently of each other by specifying targets
on build command lines. For example, you may be submitting
to a sub-project based dashboard, where you want to drive
the configure portion of the build, then submit to the
dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed by tests.
If you invoke a custom target that depends on a step halfway
through the step dependency chain, then all the previous
steps will also run to ensure everything is up to date.</p>

<p>For example, to drive configure, build and test steps
indepen- dently for each ExternalProject_Add call in your
project, write the following line prior to any
ExternalProject_Add calls in your CMakeLists file:</p>

<p>set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS
configure build test)</p>

<p>FeatureSummary Macros for generating a summary of
enabled/disabled features</p>

<p>This module provides the macros feature_summary(),
set_pack- age_properties() and add_feature_info(). For
compatibility it also still provides set_package_info(),
set_feature_info(), print_enabled_features() and
print_disabled_features().</p>

<p>These macros can be used to generate a summary of
enabled and disabled packages and/or feature for a build
tree:</p>

<p>-- The following OPTIONAL packages have been found:
LibXml2 (required version &gt;= 2.4) , XML processing
library. , &lt;http://xmlsoft.org&gt; * Enables HTML-import
in MyWordProcessor * Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor
PNG , A PNG image library. ,
&lt;http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/&gt; * Enables saving
screenshots -- The following OPTIONAL packages have not been
found: Lua51 , The Lua scripting language. ,
&lt;http://www.lua.org&gt; * Enables macros in
MyWordProcessor Foo , Foo provides cool stuff.</p>

<p>FEATURE_SUMMARY( [FILENAME &lt;file&gt;] [APPEND] [VAR
&lt;variable_name&gt;] [INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES]
[FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES] [DESCRIPTION
&quot;Found packages:&quot;] WHAT (ALL | PACKAGES_FOUND |
PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND | ENABLED_FEATURES | DISABLED_FEATURES]
)</p>

<p>The FEATURE_SUMMARY() macro can be used to print
information about enabled or disabled packages or features
of a project. By default, only the names of the
features/packages will be printed and their required version
when one was specified. Use SET_PACK- AGE_PROPERTIES() to
add more useful information, like e.g. a download URL for
the respective package or their purpose in the project.</p>

<p>The WHAT option is the only mandatory option. Here you
specify what information will be printed:</p>

<p>ALL: print everything ENABLED_FEATURES: the list of all
features which are enabled DISABLED_FEATURES: the list of
all features which are disabled PACKAGES_FOUND: the list of
all packages which have been found PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: the
list of all packages which have not been found
OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been
found which have the type OPTIONAL
OPTIONAL_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have
not been found which have the type OPTIONAL
RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have
been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
RECOMMENDED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which
have not been found which have the type RECOMMENDED
REQUIRED_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been
found which have the type REQUIRED
REQUIRED_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have
not been found which have the type REQUIRED
RUNTIME_PACKAGES_FOUND: only those packages which have been
found which have the type RUNTIME
RUNTIME_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND: only those packages which have
not been found which have the type RUNTIME</p>

<p>If a FILENAME is given, the information is printed into
this file. If APPEND is used, it is appended to this file,
otherwise the file is overwritten if it already existed. If
the VAR option is used, the information is
&quot;printed&quot; into the specified vari- able. If
FILENAME is not used, the information is printed to the
terminal. Using the DESCRIPTION option a description or
headline can be set which will be printed above the actual
content. If INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES is given, packages which
have been searched with find_package(... QUIET) will also be
listed. By default they are skipped. If
FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES is given, CMake will
abort if a package which is marked as REQUIRED has not been
found.</p>

<p>Example 1, append everything to a file:</p>

<p>feature_summary(WHAT ALL FILENAME
${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/all.log APPEND)</p>

<p>Example 2, print the enabled features into the variable
enabled- FeaturesText, including QUIET packages:</p>

<p>feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES DESCRIPTION &quot;Enabled
Features:&quot; VAR enabledFeaturesText) message(STATUS
&quot;${enabledFeaturesText}&quot;)</p>

<p>SET_PACKAGE_PROPERTIES(&lt;name&gt; PROPERTIES [ URL
&lt;url&gt; ] [ DESCRIPTION &lt;description&gt; ] [ TYPE
(RUNTIME|OPTIONAL|RECOMMENDED|REQUIRED) ] [ PURPOSE
&lt;purpose&gt; ] )</p>

<p>Use this macro to set up information about the named
package, which can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY().
This can be done either directly in the Find-module or in
the project which uses the module after the find_package()
call. The features for which information can be set are
added automatically by the find_package() command.</p>

<p>URL: this should be the homepage of the package, or
something similar. Ideally this is set already directly in
the Find-mod- ule.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A short description what that package is,
at most one sentence. Ideally this is set already directly
in the Find-module.</p>

<p>TYPE: What type of dependency has the using project on
that package. Default is OPTIONAL. In this case it is a
package which can be used by the project when available at
buildtime, but it also work without. RECOMMENDED is similar
to OPTIONAL, i.e. the project will build if the package is
not present, but the func- tionality of the resulting
binaries will be severly limited. If a REQUIRED package is
not available at buildtime, the project may not even build.
This can be combined with the FATAL_ON_MISS-
ING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES argument for feature_summary(). Last,
a RUNTIME package is a package which is actually not used at
all during the build, but which is required for actually
running the resulting binaries. So if such a package is
missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work
later on. If set_pack- age_properties() is called multiple
times for the same package with different TYPEs, the TYPE is
only changed to higher TYPEs ( RUNTIME &lt; OPTIONAL &lt;
RECOMMENDED &lt; REQUIRED ), lower TYPEs are ignored. The
TYPE property is project-specific, so it cannot be set by
the Find-module, but must be set in the project.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: This describes which features this package
enables in the project, i.e. it tells the user what
functionality he gets in the resulting binaries. If
set_package_properties() is called multiple times for a
package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list of
purposes of the package in the project. As the TYPE
property, also the PURPOSE property is project-spe- cific,
so it cannot be set by the Find-module, but must be set in
the project.</p>

<p>Example for setting the info for a package:</p>

<p>find_package(LibXml2) set_package_properties(LibXml2
PROPERTIES DESCRIPTION &quot;A XML processing library.&quot;
URL &quot;http://xmlsoft.org/&quot;)</p>

<p>set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES TYPE
RECOMMENDED PURPOSE &quot;Enables HTML-import in
MyWordProcessor&quot;) ... set_package_properties(LibXml2
PROPERTIES TYPE OPTIONAL PURPOSE &quot;Enables odt-export in
MyWordProcessor&quot;)</p>

<p>find_package(DBUS) set_package_properties(DBUS
PROPERTIES TYPE RUNTIME PURPOSE &quot;Necessary to disable
the screensaver during a presentation&quot; )</p>

<p>ADD_FEATURE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;enabled&gt;
&lt;description&gt;)</p>

<p>Use this macro to add information about a feature with
the given &lt;name&gt;. &lt;enabled&gt; contains whether
this feature is enabled or not, &lt;description&gt; is a
text describing the feature. The infor- mation can be
displayed using feature_summary() for ENABLED_FEA- TURES and
DISABLED_FEATURES respectively.</p>

<p>Example for setting the info for a feature:</p>

<p>option(WITH_FOO &quot;Help for foo&quot; ON)
add_feature_info(Foo WITH_FOO &quot;The Foo feature provides
very cool stuff.&quot;)</p>

<p>The following macros are provided for compatibility with
previ- ous CMake versions:</p>

<p>SET_PACKAGE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt;
[&lt;url&gt; [&lt;purpose&gt;] ] )</p>

<p>Use this macro to set up information about the named
package, which can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY().
This can be done either directly in the Find-module or in
the project which uses the module after the find_package()
call. The features for which information can be set are
added automatically by the find_package() command.</p>

<p>PRINT_ENABLED_FEATURES()</p>

<p>Does the same as FEATURE_SUMMARY(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
DESCRIP- TION &quot;Enabled features:&quot;)</p>

<p>PRINT_DISABLED_FEATURES()</p>

<p>Does the same as FEATURE_SUMMARY(WHAT DISABLED_FEATURES
DESCRIPTION &quot;Disabled features:&quot;)</p>

<p>SET_FEATURE_INFO(&lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt;
[&lt;url&gt;] )</p>

<p>Does the same as SET_PACKAGE_INFO(&lt;name&gt;
&lt;description&gt; &lt;url&gt; )</p>

<p>FindALSA Find alsa</p>

<p>Find the alsa libraries (asound)</p>

<p>This module defines the following variables: ALSA_FOUND
- True if ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR &amp; ALSA_LIBRARY are found
ALSA_LIBRARIES - Set when ALSA_LIBRARY is found
ALSA_INCLUDE_DIRS - Set when ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR is found</p>

<p>ALSA_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find asoundlib.h, etc.
ALSA_LIBRARY - the asound library ALSA_VERSION_STRING - the
version of alsa found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindASPELL Try to find ASPELL</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>ASPELL_FOUND - system has ASPELL ASPELL_EXECUTABLE - the
ASPELL executable ASPELL_INCLUDE_DIR - the ASPELL include
directory ASPELL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use
ASPELL ASPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for
using ASPELL</p>

<p>FindAVIFile Locate AVIFILE library and include paths</p>

<p>AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/)is a set of
libraries for i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.
Support is limited beyond Linux. Windows provides native AVI
support, and so doesnt need this library. This module
defines</p>

<p>AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, dont try to use AVIFILE</p>

<p>FindArmadillo Find Armadillo</p>

<p>Find the Armadillo C++ library</p>

<p>Using Armadillo:</p>

<p>find_package(Armadillo REQUIRED)
include_directories(${ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(foo foo.cc) target_link_libraries(foo
${ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>This module sets the following variables:</p>

<p>ARMADILLO_FOUND - set to true if the library is found
ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS - list of required include
directories ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES - list of libraries to be
linked ARMADILLO_VERSION_MAJOR - major version number
ARMADILLO_VERSION_MINOR - minor version number
ARMADILLO_VERSION_PATCH - patch version number
ARMADILLO_VERSION_STRING - version number as a string (ex:
&quot;1.0.4&quot;) ARMADILLO_VERSION_NAME - name of the
version (ex: &quot;Antipodean Antileech&quot;)</p>

<p>FindBISON Find bison executable and provides macros to
generate custom build rules</p>

<p>The module defines the following variables:</p>

<p>BISON_EXECUTABLE - path to the bison program
BISON_VERSION - version of bison BISON_FOUND - true if the
program was found</p>

<p>The minimum required version of bison can be specified
using the standard CMake syntax, e.g. find_package(BISON
2.1.3)</p>

<p>If bison is found, the module defines the macros:</p>

<p>BISON_TARGET(&lt;Name&gt; &lt;YaccInput&gt;
&lt;CodeOutput&gt; [VERBOSE &lt;file&gt;] [COMPILE_FLAGS
&lt;string&gt;])</p>

<p>which will create a custom rule to generate a parser.
&lt;YaccIn- put&gt; is the path to a yacc file.
&lt;CodeOutput&gt; is the name of the source file generated
by bison. A header file is also be generated, and contains
the token list. If COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the
next parameter is added in the bison command line. if
VERBOSE option is specified, &lt;file&gt; is created and
contains verbose descriptions of the grammar and parser. The
macro defines a set of variables:</p>

<p>BISON_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran
successfully BISON_${Name}_INPUT - The input source file, an
alias for &lt;YaccInput&gt; BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_SOURCE -
The source file generated by bison
BISON_${Name}_OUTPUT_HEADER - The header file generated by
bison BISON_${Name}_OUTPUTS - The sources files generated by
bison BISON_${Name}_COMPILE_FLAGS - Options used in the
bison command line</p>


<p>====================================================================
Example:</p>

<p>find_package(BISON) BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp) add_executable(Foo
main.cpp ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS})
====================================================================</p>

<p>FindBLAS Find BLAS library</p>

<p>This module finds an installed fortran library that
implements the BLAS linear-algebra interface (see
http://www.netlib.org/blas/). The list of libraries searched
for is taken from the autoconf macro file, acx_blas.m4
(distributed at
http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).</p>

<p>This module sets the following variables:</p>

<p>BLAS_FOUND - set to true if a library implementing the
BLAS interface is found BLAS_LINKER_FLAGS - uncached list of
required linker flags (excluding -l and -L). BLAS_LIBRARIES
- uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to link
against to use BLAS BLAS95_LIBRARIES - uncached list of
libraries (using full path name) to link against to use
BLAS95 interface BLAS95_FOUND - set to true if a library
implementing the BLAS f95 interface is found BLA_STATIC if
set on this determines what kind of linkage we do (static)
BLA_VENDOR if set checks only the specified vendor, if not
set checks all the possibilities BLA_F95 if set on tries to
find the f95 interfaces for BLAS/LAPACK</p>

<p>C/CXX should be enabled to use Intel mkl</p>

<p>FindBZip2 Try to find BZip2</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>BZIP2_FOUND - system has BZip2 BZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR - the
BZip2 include directory BZIP2_LIBRARIES - Link these to use
BZip2 BZIP2_NEED_PREFIX - this is set if the functions are
prefixed with BZ2_ BZIP2_VERSION_STRING - the version of
BZip2 found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindBoost Find Boost include dirs and libraries</p>

<p>Use this module by invoking find_package with the
form:</p>

<p>find_package(Boost [version] [EXACT] # Minimum or EXACT
version e.g. 1.36.0 [REQUIRED] # Fail with error if Boost is
not found [COMPONENTS &lt;libs&gt;...] # Boost libraries by
their canonical name ) # e.g. &quot;date_time&quot; for
&quot;libboost_date_time&quot;</p>

<p>This module finds headers and requested component
libraries OR a CMake package configuration file provided by
a &quot;Boost CMake&quot; build. For the latter case skip to
the &quot;Boost CMake&quot; section below. For the former
case results are reported in variables:</p>

<p>Boost_FOUND - True if headers and requested libraries
were found Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS - Boost include directories
Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS - Link directories for Boost libraries
Boost_LIBRARIES - Boost component libraries to be linked
Boost_&lt;C&gt;_FOUND - True if component &lt;C&gt; was
found (&lt;C&gt; is upper-case) Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY -
Libraries to link for component &lt;C&gt; (may include
target_link_libraries debug/optimized keywords)
Boost_VERSION - BOOST_VERSION value from boost/version.hpp
Boost_LIB_VERSION - Version string appended to library
filenames Boost_MAJOR_VERSION - Boost major version number
(X in X.y.z) Boost_MINOR_VERSION - Boost minor version
number (Y in x.Y.z) Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION - Boost subminor
version number (Z in x.y.Z) Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS
(Windows) - Pass to add_definitions() to have diagnostic
information about Boosts automatic linking displayed during
compilation</p>

<p>This module reads hints about search locations from
variables:</p>

<p>BOOST_ROOT - Preferred installation prefix (or
BOOSTROOT) BOOST_INCLUDEDIR - Preferred include directory
e.g. &lt;prefix&gt;/include BOOST_LIBRARYDIR - Preferred
library directory e.g. &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS - Set to ON to disable searching in
locations not specified by these hint variables. Default is
OFF. Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS - List of Boost versions not
known to this module (Boost install locations may contain
the version)</p>

<p>and saves search results persistently in CMake cache
entries:</p>

<p>Boost_INCLUDE_DIR - Directory containing Boost headers
Boost_LIBRARY_DIR - Directory containing Boost libraries
Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG - Component &lt;C&gt; library
debug variant Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE - Component
&lt;C&gt; library release variant</p>

<p>Users may set these hints or results as cache entries.
Projects should not read these entries directly but instead
use the above result variables. Note that some hint names
start in upper-case &quot;BOOST&quot;. One may specify these
as environment variables if they are not specified as CMake
variables or cache entries.</p>

<p>This module first searches for the Boost header files
using the above hint variables (excluding BOOST_LIBRARYDIR)
and saves the result in Boost_INCLUDE_DIR. Then it searches
for requested component libraries using the above hints
(excluding BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS),
&quot;lib&quot; directo- ries near Boost_INCLUDE_DIR, and
the library name configuration settings below. It saves the
library directory in Boost_LIBRARY_DIR and individual
library locations in Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_DEBUG and
Boost_&lt;C&gt;_LIBRARY_RELEASE. When one changes settings
used by previous searches in the same build tree (excluding
environment variables) this module discards pre- vious
search results affected by the changes and searches
again.</p>

<p>Boost libraries come in many variants encoded in their
file name. Users or projects may tell this module which
variant to find by setting variables:</p>

<p>Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED - Set to OFF to use the
non-multithreaded libraries ( mt tag). Default is ON.
Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS - Set to ON to force the use of the
static libraries. Default is OFF. Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME -
Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use libraries linked
statically to the C++ runtime (s tag). Default is platform
dependent. Boost_USE_DEBUG_PYTHON - Set to ON to use
libraries compiled with a debug Python build ( y tag).
Default is OFF. Boost_USE_STLPORT - Set to ON to use
libraries compiled with STLPort ( p tag). Default is OFF.
Boost_USE_STLPORT_DEPRECATED_NATIVE_IOSTREAMS - Set to ON to
use libraries compiled with STLPort deprecated &quot;native
iostreams&quot; ( n tag). Default is OFF. Boost_COMPILER -
Set to the compiler-specific library suffix (e.g.
&quot;-gcc43&quot;). Default is auto-computed for the C++
compiler in use. Boost_THREADAPI - Suffix for
&quot;thread&quot; component library name, such as
&quot;pthread&quot; or &quot;win32&quot;. Names with and
without this suffix will both be tried.</p>

<p>Other variables one may set to control this module
are:</p>

<p>Boost_DEBUG - Set to ON to enable debug output from
FindBoost. Please enable this before filing any bug report.
Boost_DETAILED_FAILURE_MSG - Set to ON to add detailed
information to the failure message even when the REQUIRED
option is not given to the find_package call. Boost_REALPATH
- Set to ON to resolve symlinks for discovered libraries to
assist with packaging. For example, the &quot;system&quot;
component library may be resolved to
&quot;/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.42.0&quot; instead of
&quot;/usr/lib/libboost_system.so&quot;. This does not
affect linking and should not be enabled unless the user
needs this information.</p>

<p>On Visual Studio and Borland compilers Boost headers
request automatic linking to corresponding libraries. This
requires matching libraries to be linked explicitly or
available in the link library search path. In this case
setting Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF may not achieve dynamic
linking. Boost automatic linking typically requests static
libraries with a few exceptions (such as Boost.Python).
Use</p>


<p>add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS})</p>

<p>to ask Boost to report information about automatic
linking requests.</p>

<p>Example to find Boost headers only:</p>

<p>find_package(Boost 1.36.0) if(Boost_FOUND)
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(foo foo.cc) endif()</p>

<p>Example to find Boost headers and some libraries:</p>

<p>set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON) set(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME

<p>Boost CMake
----------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>If Boost was built using the boost-cmake project it
provides a package configuration file for use with
find_packages Config mode. This module looks for the package
configuration file called BoostConfig.cmake or
boost-config.cmake and stores the result in cache entry
&quot;Boost_DIR&quot;. If found, the package con- figuration
file is loaded and this module returns with no fur- ther
action. See documentation of the Boost CMake package con-
figuration for details on what it provides.</p>

<p>Set Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE to ON to disable the search for
boost-cmake.</p>

<p>FindBullet Try to find the Bullet physics engine</p>

<p>This module defines the following variables</p>

<p>BULLET_FOUND - Was bullet found BULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS -
the Bullet include directories BULLET_LIBRARIES - Link to
this, by default it includes all bullet components
(Dynamics, Collision, LinearMath, &amp; SoftBody)</p>

<p>This module accepts the following variables</p>

<p>BULLET_ROOT - Can be set to bullet install path or
Windows build path</p>

<p>FindCABLE Find CABLE</p>

<p>This module finds if CABLE is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>CABLE the path to the cable executable CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY
the path to the Tcl wrapper library CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR the
path to the include directory</p>

<p>To build Tcl wrappers, you should add shared library and
link it to ${CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY}. You should also add
${CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR} as an include directory.</p>

<p>FindCUDA Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and
build dependen- cies.</p>

<p>This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools. It should
work on linux, windows, and mac and should be reasonably up
to date with CUDA C releases.</p>

<p>This script makes use of the standard find_package
arguments of &lt;VERSION&gt;, REQUIRED and QUIET. CUDA_FOUND
will report if an acceptable version of CUDA was found.</p>

<p>The script will prompt the user to specify
CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if the prefix cannot be determined by
the location of nvcc in the system path and REQUIRED is
specified to find_package(). To use a different installed
version of the toolkit set the envi- ronment variable
CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g.
CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default
/usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after
configuring. If you change the value of
CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various compo- nents that depend on
the path will be relocated.</p>

<p>It might be necessary to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR
manually on certain platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not
installed in the default location. In newer versions of the
toolkit the cuda library is included with the graphics
driver- be sure that the driver version matches what is
needed by the cuda runtime ver- sion.</p>

<p>The following variables affect the behavior of the
macros in the script (in alphebetical order). Note that any
of these flags can be changed multiple times in the same
directory before call- ing CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, CUDA_COMPILE_PTX or
CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.</p>

<p>CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
-- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32
bit device code. Note that making this different from the
host code when generating object or C files from CUDA code
just wont work, because size_t gets defined by nvcc in the
generated source. If you compile to PTX and then load the
file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and
host.</p>

<p>CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON) --
Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached
to the source file in Visual Studio. Turn OFF if you add the
same cuda file to multiple targets.</p>

<p>This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA
file; however, bad things can happen if the CUDA source file
is added to multiple targets. When performing parallel
builds it is possible for the custom build command to be run
more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build errors.
VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it
is added to. When the rule is run from multiple targets race
conditions can occur on the generated file. Eventually
everything will get built, but if the user is unaware of
this behavior, there may be confusion. It would be nice if
this script could detect the reuse of source files across
multiple targets and turn the option off for the user, but
no good solution could be found.</p>

<p>CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF) -- Set to ON to enable
and extra compilation pass with the -cubin option in Device
mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage
is printed during build.</p>

<p>CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode) --
Set to ON for Emulation mode. -D_DEVICEEMU is defined for
CUDA C files when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.</p>

<p>CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR) -- Set to the path you wish to
have the generated files placed. If it is blank output files
will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR. Intermediate
files will always be placed in
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.</p>

<p>CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON) -- Set to OFF for
C compilation of host code.</p>

<p>CUDA_HOST_COMPILER (Default CMAKE_C_COMPILER,
$(VCInstallDir)/bin for VS) -- Set the host compiler to be
used by nvcc. Ignored if -ccbin or --compiler-bindir is
already present in the CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or
CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; variables. For Visual Studio
targets $(VCInstallDir)/bin is a special value that expands
out to the path when the command is run from withing VS.</p>

<p>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; --
Additional NVCC command line arguments. NOTE: multiple
arguments must be semi-colon delimited (e.g.
--compiler-options;-Wall)</p>

<p>CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON) -- Set to ON to
propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG)
automatically to the host compiler through nvccs -Xcompiler
flag. This helps make the generated host code match the rest
of the system better. Sometimes certain flags give nvcc
problems, and this will help you turn the flag propagation
off. This does not affect the flags supplied directly to
nvcc via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags
specified through CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or
CUDA_WRAP_SRCS. Flags used for shared library compilation
are not affected by this flag.</p>

<p>CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION (Default OFF) -- If set this
will enable separable compilation for all CUDA runtime
object files. If used outside of CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY (e.g. calling CUDA_WRAP_SRCS directly),
CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME and
CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS should be
called.</p>

<p>CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF) -- Set to ON to see all
the commands used when building the CUDA file. When using a
Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting
CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will always print the output.</p>

<p>The script creates the following macros (in alphebetical
order):</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target ) -- Adds the
cufft library to the target (can be any target). Handles
whether you are in emulation mode or not.</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target ) -- Adds the
cublas library to the target (can be any target). Handles
whether you are in emulation mode or not.</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ... [WIN32]
[MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] ) --
Creates an executable &quot;cuda_target&quot; which is made
up of the files specified. All of the non CUDA C files are
compiled using the standard build rules specified by CMAKE
and the cuda files are compiled to object files using nvcc
and the host compiler. In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
added automatically to include_directories(). Some standard
CMake target calls can be used on the target after calling
this macro (e.g. set_target_properties and
target_link_libraries), but setting properties that adjust
compilation flags will not affect code compiled by nvcc.
Such flags should be modified before calling
CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.</p>

<p>CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ... [STATIC |
SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] ) -- Same
as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.</p>

<p>CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET() -- Creates a convience target
that deletes all the dependency files generated. You should
make clean after running this target to ensure the
dependency files get regenerated.</p>

<p>CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC |
SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] ) -- Returns a list of
generated files from the input source files to be used with
ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.</p>

<p>CUDA_COMPILE_PTX( generated_files file0 file1 ...
[OPTIONS ...] ) -- Returns a list of PTX files generated
from the input source files.</p>

<p>CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME(
output_file_var cuda_target object_files ) -- Compute the
name of the intermediate link file used for separable
compilation. This file name is typically passed into
CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS. output_file_var is
produced based on cuda_target the list of objects files that
need separable compilation as specified by object_files. If
the object_files list is empty, then output_file_var will be
empty. This function is called automatically for
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY and CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE. Note that this is
a function and not a macro.</p>

<p>CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... ) -- Sets the
directories that should be passed to nvcc (e.g. nvcc -Ipath0
-Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
files.</p>

<p>CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS( output_file_var
cuda_target nvcc_flags object_files)</p>

<p>-- Generates the link object required by separable
compilation from the given object files. This is called
automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY,
but can be called manually when using CUDA_WRAP_SRCS
directly. When called from CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or
CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE the nvcc_flags passed in are the same as
the flags passed in via the OPTIONS argument. The only nvcc
flag added automatically is the bitness flag as specified by
CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE. Note that this is a function
instead of a macro.</p>

<p>CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files
file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
-- This is where all the magic happens. CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all
call this function under the hood.</p>

<p>Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this
macro generates custom commands that generate either PTX or
linkable objects (use &quot;PTX&quot; or &quot;OBJ&quot; for
the format argument to switch). Files that dont end with .cu
or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.</p>

<p>The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command
line options to give to nvcc. You can also specify per
configuration options by specifying the name of the
configuration followed by the options. General options must
preceed configuration specific options. Not all
configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided
will be used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -DFLAG=2 &quot;-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag&quot;
DEBUG -g RELEASE --use_fast_math RELWITHDEBINFO
--use_fast_math;-g MINSIZEREL --use_fast_math</p>

<p>For certain configurations (namely VS generating object
files with CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to
ON), no generated file will be produced for the given cuda
file. This is because when you add the cuda file to Visual
Studio it knows that this file produces an object file and
will link in the resulting object file automatically.</p>

<p>This script will also generate a separate cmake script
that is used at build time to invoke nvcc. This is for
several reasons.</p>

<p>1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values
which confuses Visual Studio into thinking that the command
succeeded. The script now checks the error codes and
produces errors when there was a problem.</p>

<p>2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results
when it encounters problems. This confuses build systems
into thinking the target was generated when in fact an
unusable file exists. The script now deletes the output
files if there was an error.</p>

<p>3. By putting all the options that affect the build into
a file and then make the build rule dependent on the file,
the output files will be regenerated when the options
change.</p>

<p>This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC,
SHARED, or MODULE to determine when to target the object
compilation for a shared library. BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is
ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY. On some systems special flags are added
for building objects intended for shared libraries. A
preprocessor macro, &lt;target_name&gt;_EXPORTS is defined
when a shared library compilation is detected.</p>

<p>Flags passed into add_definitions with -D or /D are
passed along to nvcc.</p>

<p>The script defines the following variables:</p>

<p>CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR -- The major version of cuda as
reported by nvcc. CUDA_VERSION_MINOR -- The minor version.
CUDA_VERSION CUDA_VERSION_STRING --
CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR</p>

<p>CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA Toolkit
(defined if not set). CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR -- Path to the CUDA
SDK. Use this to find files in the SDK. This script will not
directly support finding specific libraries or headers, as
that isnt supported by NVIDIA. If you want to change
libraries when the path changes see the FindCUDA.cmake
script for an example of how to clear these variables. There
are also examples of how to use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to
locate headers or libraries, if you so choose (at your own
risk). CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS -- Include directory for cuda
headers. Added automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY. CUDA_LIBRARIES -- Cuda RT library.
CUDA_CUFFT_LIBRARIES -- Device or emulation library for the
Cuda FFT implementation (alternative to:
CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET macro) CUDA_CUBLAS_LIBRARIES --
Device or emulation library for the Cuda BLAS implementation
(alterative to: CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET macro).
CUDA_cupti_LIBRARY -- CUDA Profiling Tools Interface
library. Only available for CUDA version 4.0+.
CUDA_curand_LIBRARY -- CUDA Random Number Generation
library. Only available for CUDA version 3.2+.
CUDA_cusparse_LIBRARY -- CUDA Sparse Matrix library. Only
available for CUDA version 3.2+. CUDA_npp_LIBRARY -- NVIDIA
Performance Primitives library. Only available for CUDA
version 4.0+. CUDA_nppc_LIBRARY -- NVIDIA Performance
Primitives library (core). Only available for CUDA version

<p>FindCxxTest Find CxxTest</p>

<p>Find the CxxTest suite and declare a helper macro for
creating unit tests and integrating them with CTest. For
more details on CxxTest see http://cxxtest.tigris.org</p>

<p>INPUT Variables</p>

<p>CXXTEST_USE_PYTHON [deprecated since 1.3] Only used in
the case both Python &amp; Perl are detected on the system
to control which CxxTest code generator is used. Valid only
for CxxTest version 3.</p>

<p>NOTE: In older versions of this Find Module, this
variable controlled if the Python test generator was used
instead of the Perl one, regardless of which scripting
language the user had installed.</p>

<p>CXXTEST_TESTGEN_ARGS (since CMake 2.8.3) Specify a list
of options to pass to the CxxTest code generator. If not
defined, --error-printer is passed.</p>

<p>OUTPUT Variables</p>

<p>CXXTEST_FOUND True if the CxxTest framework was found
CXXTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS Where to find the CxxTest include
directory CXXTEST_PERL_TESTGEN_EXECUTABLE The perl-based
test generator CXXTEST_PYTHON_TESTGEN_EXECUTABLE The
python-based test generator CXXTEST_TESTGEN_EXECUTABLE
(since CMake 2.8.3) The test generator that is actually used
(chosen using user preferences and interpreters found in the
system) CXXTEST_TESTGEN_INTERPRETER (since CMake 2.8.3) The
full path to the Perl or Python executable on the system</p>

<p>MACROS for optional use by CMake users:</p>

<p>CXXTEST_ADD_TEST(&lt;test_name&gt;
&lt;gen_source_file&gt; &lt;input_files_to_testgen...&gt;)
Creates a CxxTest runner and adds it to the CTest testing

include_directories(${CXXTEST_INCLUDE_DIR})
enable_testing()</p>

<p>CXXTEST_ADD_TEST(unittest_foo foo_test.cc
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/foo_test.h)
target_link_libraries(unittest_foo foo) # as needed
endif()</p>

<p>This will (if CxxTest is found): 1. Invoke the testgen
executable to autogenerate foo_test.cc in the binary tree
from &quot;foo_test.h&quot; in the current source directory.
2. Create an executable and test called unittest_foo.</p>

<p>#============= Example foo_test.h:</p>

<p>#include &lt;cxxtest/TestSuite.h&gt;</p>

<p>class MyTestSuite : public CxxTest::TestSuite { public:
void testAddition( void ) { TS_ASSERT( 1 + 1 &gt; 1 );
TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( 1 + 1, 2 ); } };</p>

<p>FindCygwin this module looks for Cygwin</p>

<p>FindDCMTK find DCMTK libraries and applications</p>

<p>FindDart Find DART</p>

<p>This module looks for the dart testing software and sets
DART_ROOT to point to where it found it.</p>

<p>FindDevIL</p>

<p>This module locates the developers image library.
http://ope- nil.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>This module sets:</p>

<p>IL_LIBRARIES - the name of the IL library. These include
the full path to the core DevIL library. This one has to be
linked into the application. ILU_LIBRARIES - the name of the
ILU library. Again, the full path. This library is for
filters and effects, not actual loading. It doesnt have to
be linked if the functionality it provides is not used.
ILUT_LIBRARIES - the name of the ILUT library. Full path.
This part of the library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not
strictly needed in applications. IL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to
find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files. IL_FOUND - this is
set to TRUE if all the above variables were set. This will
be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found, even if they
are not needed. In most systems, if one library is found all
the others are as well. Thats the way the DevIL developers
release it.</p>

<p>FindDoxygen This module looks for Doxygen and the path
to Graphvizs dot</p>

<p>Doxygen is a documentation generation tool. Please see
http://www.doxygen.org</p>

<p>This module accepts the following optional
variables:</p>

<p>DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT = If true this module will skip trying
to find Dot (an optional component often used by
Doxygen)</p>

<p>This modules defines the following variables:</p>

<p>DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE = The path to the doxygen command.
DOXYGEN_FOUND = Was Doxygen found or not? DOXYGEN_VERSION =
The version reported by doxygen --version</p>

<p>DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE = The path to the dot program
used by doxygen. DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND = Was Dot found or not?
DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH = The path to dot not including the
executable</p>

<p>FindEXPAT Find expat</p>

<p>Find the native EXPAT headers and libraries.</p>

<p>EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIRS - where to find expat.h, etc.
EXPAT_LIBRARIES - List of libraries when using expat.
EXPAT_FOUND - True if expat found.</p>

<p>FindFLEX Find flex executable and provides a macro to
generate custom build rules</p>

<p>The module defines the following variables:</p>

<p>FLEX_FOUND - true is flex executable is found
FLEX_EXECUTABLE - the path to the flex executable
FLEX_VERSION - the version of flex FLEX_LIBRARIES - The flex
libraries FLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS - The path to the flex
headers</p>

<p>The minimum required version of flex can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(FLEX
2.5.13)</p>

<p>If flex is found on the system, the module provides the
macro:</p>

<p>FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput [COMPILE_FLAGS
&lt;string&gt;])</p>

<p>which creates a custom command to generate the
&lt;FlexOutput&gt; file from the &lt;FlexInput&gt; file. If
COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the next parameter is
added to the flex command line. Name is an alias used to get
details of this custom command. Indeed the macro defines the
following variables:</p>

<p>FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran
successfully FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS - the source file
generated by the custom rule, an alias for FlexOutput
FLEX_${Name}_INPUT - the flex source file, an alias for
${FlexInput}</p>

<p>Flex scanners oftenly use tokens defined by Bison: the
code generated by Flex depends of the header generated by
Bison. This module also defines a macro:</p>

<p>ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)</p>

<p>which adds the required dependency between a scanner and
a parser where &lt;FlexTarget&gt; and &lt;BisonTarget&gt;
are the first parameters of respectively FLEX_TARGET and
BISON_TARGET macros.</p>


<p>====================================================================
Example:</p>

<p>find_package(BISON) find_package(FLEX)</p>

<p>BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
FLEX_TARGET(MyScanner lexer.l
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/lexer.cpp)
ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(MyScanner MyParser)</p>

<p>include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
add_executable(Foo Foo.cc ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS}
${FLEX_MyScanner_OUTPUTS} )
====================================================================</p>

<p>FindFLTK Find the native FLTK includes and library</p>

<p>By default FindFLTK.cmake will search for all of the
FLTK compo- nents and add them to the FLTK_LIBRARIES
variable.</p>

<p>You can limit the components which get placed in
FLTK_LIBRARIES by defining one or more of the following
three options:</p>

<p>FLTK_SKIP_OPENGL, set to true to disable searching for
opengl and the FLTK GL library FLTK_SKIP_FORMS, set to true
to disable searching for fltk_forms FLTK_SKIP_IMAGES, set to
true to disable searching for fltk_images</p>

<p>FLTK_SKIP_FLUID, set to true if the fluid binary need
not be present at build time</p>

<p>The following variables will be defined:</p>

<p>FLTK_FOUND, True if all components not skipped were
found FLTK_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find include files
FLTK_LIBRARIES, list of fltk libraries you should link
against FLTK_FLUID_EXECUTABLE, where to find the Fluid tool
FLTK_WRAP_UI, This enables the FLTK_WRAP_UI command</p>

<p>The following cache variables are assigned but should
not be used. See the FLTK_LIBRARIES variable instead.</p>

<p>FLTK_BASE_LIBRARY = the full path to fltk.lib
FLTK_GL_LIBRARY = the full path to fltk_gl.lib
FLTK_FORMS_LIBRARY = the full path to fltk_forms.lib
FLTK_IMAGES_LIBRARY = the full path to fltk_images.lib</p>

<p>FindFLTK2 Find the native FLTK2 includes and library</p>

<p>The following settings are defined</p>

<p>FLTK2_FLUID_EXECUTABLE, where to find the Fluid tool
FLTK2_WRAP_UI, This enables the FLTK2_WRAP_UI command
FLTK2_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find include files
FLTK2_LIBRARIES, list of fltk2 libraries FLTK2_FOUND, Dont
use FLTK2 if false.</p>

<p>The following settings should not be used in
general.</p>

<p>FLTK2_BASE_LIBRARY = the full path to fltk2.lib
FLTK2_GL_LIBRARY = the full path to fltk2_gl.lib
FLTK2_IMAGES_LIBRARY = the full path to fltk2_images.lib</p>

<p>FindFreetype Locate FreeType library</p>

[INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;dest- dir&gt;] LANGUAGES
&lt;lang1&gt; &lt;lang2&gt; ... )</p>

<p>Process the given pot file to mo files. If
INSTALL_DESTINATION is given then automatically install
rules will be created, the language subdirectory will be
taken into account (by default use share/locale/). If ALL is
specified, the pot file is processed when building the all
traget. It creates a custom target &quot;potfile&quot;.</p>

<p>GETTEXT_PROCESS_PO_FILES( &lt;lang&gt; [ALL]
[INSTALL_DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;] PO_FILES &lt;po1&gt;
&lt;po2&gt; ... )</p>

<p>FindHDF5 Find HDF5, a library for reading and writing
self describing array data.</p>

<p>This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that
should be installed alongside HDF5. Depending upon the HDF5
Configura- tion, the wrapper compiler is called either h5cc
or h5pcc. If this succeeds, the module will then call the
compiler with the -show argument to see what flags are used
when compiling an HDF5 client application.</p>

<p>The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS
argument. If no COMPONENTS are specified, then the find
module will default to finding only the HDF5 C library. If
one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will
attempt to find the language bindings for the specified
components. The only valid compo- nents are C, CXX, Fortran,
HL, and Fortran_HL. If the COMPO- NENTS argument is not
given, the module will attempt to find only the C
bindings.</p>

<p>On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable
HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to
prefer a static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of
its depen- dencies. To use this feature, make sure that the
HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to
find_package.</p>

<p>To provide the module with a hint about where to find
your HDF5 installation, you can set the environment variable
HDF5_ROOT. The Find module will then look in this path when
searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.</p>

<p>In addition to finding the includes and libraries
required to compile an HDF5 client application, this module
also makes an effort to find tools that come with the HDF5
distribution that may be useful for regression testing.</p>

<p>This module will define the following variables:</p>

<p>FindMPI Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI)
implementation</p>

<p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to
write high-performance distributed-memory parallel
applications, and is typically deployed on a cluster. MPI is
a standard interface (defined by the MPI forum) for which
many implementations are available. All of them have
somewhat different include paths, libraries to link against,
etc., and this module tries to smooth out those
differences.</p>

<p>=== Variables ===</p>

<p>This module will set the following variables per
language in your project, where &lt;lang&gt; is one of C,
CXX, or Fortran:</p>

<p>MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND TRUE if FindMPI found MPI flags
for &lt;lang&gt; MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER MPI Compiler
wrapper for &lt;lang&gt; MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILE_FLAGS
Compilation flags for MPI programs
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH Include path(s) for MPI header
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LINK_FLAGS Linking flags for MPI programs
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES All libraries to link MPI
programs against</p>

<p>Additionally, FindMPI sets the following variables for
running MPI programs from the command line:</p>

<p>MPIEXEC Executable for running MPI programs
MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving
it the number of processors to run on MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS Flags
to pass to MPIEXEC directly before the executable to run.
MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after other
flags</p>

<p>=== Usage ===</p>

<p>To use this module, simply call FindMPI from a
CMakeLists.txt file, or run find_package(MPI), then run
CMake. If you are happy with the auto- detected
configuration for your language, then youre done. If not,
you have two options:</p>

<p>1. Set MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER to the MPI wrapper
(mpicc, etc.) of your choice and reconfigure. FindMPI will
attempt to determine all the necessary variables using THAT
compiler s compile and link flags. 2. If this fails, or if
your MPI implementation does not come with a compiler
wrapper, then set both MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARIES and
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_INCLUDE_PATH. You may also set any other
variables listed above, but these two are required. This
will circumvent autodetection entirely.</p>

<p>When configuration is successful,
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_COMPILER will be set to the compiler
wrapper for &lt;lang&gt;, if it was found.
MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_FOUND and other variables above will be set
if any MPI implementation was found for &lt;lang&gt;,
regardless of whether a compiler was found.</p>

<p>When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you
should typi- cally use all of the MPIEXEC flags as
follows:</p>

<p>${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS
${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS</p>

<p>where PROCS is the number of processors on which to
execute the program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS
are the argu- ments to pass to the MPI program.</p>

<p>=== Backward Compatibility ===</p>

<p>For backward compatibility with older versions of
FindMPI, these variables are set, but deprecated:</p>

<p>MPI_FOUND MPI_COMPILER MPI_LIBRARY MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY MPI_LINK_FLAGS
MPI_LIBRARIES</p>

<p>In new projects, please use the MPI_&lt;lang&gt;_XXX
equivalents.</p>

<p>FindMatlab this module looks for Matlab</p>

<p>Defines:</p>

<p>MATLAB_INCLUDE_DIR: include path for mex.h, engine.h
MATLAB_LIBRARIES: required libraries: libmex, etc
MATLAB_MEX_LIBRARY: path to libmex.lib MATLAB_MX_LIBRARY:
path to libmx.lib MATLAB_ENG_LIBRARY: path to libeng.lib</p>

<p>Once done this will define:</p>

<p>MOTIF_FOUND - system has MOTIF MOTIF_INCLUDE_DIR -
include paths to use Motif MOTIF_LIBRARIES - Link these to
use Motif</p>

<p>FindOpenAL</p>

<p>Locate OpenAL This module defines OPENAL_LIBRARY
OPENAL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenAL
OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>

<p>$OPENALDIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR used in
building OpenAL.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the
FindSDL.cmake module.</p>

<p>FindOpenGL Try to find OpenGL</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>OPENGL_FOUND - system has OpenGL OPENGL_XMESA_FOUND -
system has XMESA OPENGL_GLU_FOUND - system has GLU
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR - the GL include directory
OPENGL_LIBRARIES - Link these to use OpenGL and GLU</p>

<p>If you want to use just GL you can use these values</p>

<p>OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY - Path to OpenGL Library
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY - Path to GLU Library</p>

<p>On OSX default to using the framework version of opengl
People will have to change the cache values of
OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY and OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to use OpenGL with
X11 on OSX</p>

<p>FindOpenMP Finds OpenMP support</p>

<p>This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a
compiler. If the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags
required to compile with OpenMP support are returned in
variables for the different languages. The variables may be
empty if the compiler does not need a special flag to
support OpenMP.</p>

<p>The following variables are set:</p>

<p>OpenMP_C_FLAGS - flags to add to the C compiler for
OpenMP support OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS - flags to add to the CXX
compiler for OpenMP support OPENMP_FOUND - true if openmp is
detected</p>

<p>Supported compilers can be found at
http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/</p>

<p>FindOpenSSL Try to find the OpenSSL encryption
library</p>

<p>Once done this will define</p>

<p>OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR - Set this variable to the root
installation of OpenSSL</p>

<p>Read-Only variables:</p>

<p>OPENSSL_FOUND - system has the OpenSSL library
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR - the OpenSSL include directory
OPENSSL_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use OpenSSL
OPENSSL_VERSION - This is set to
$major.$minor.$revision$path (eg. 0.9.8s)</p>

<p>FindOpenSceneGraph Find OpenSceneGraph</p>

<p>This module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core
&quot;osg&quot; library as well as OpenThreads, and whatever
additional COMPONENTS (nodekits) that you specify.</p>

<p>See http://www.openscenegraph.org</p>

<p>NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either
require CMake &gt;= 2.6.3 with
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.3) or download and place
FindOpenThreads.cmake, Findosg_func- tions.cmake,
Findosg.cmake, and Find&lt;etc&gt;.cmake files into your
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.</p>

<p>==================================</p>

<p>This module accepts the following variables (note mixed
case)</p>

<p>OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG - Enable debugging output</p>

<p>OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED - Mark cache variables
as advanced automatically</p>

<p>The following environment variables are also respected
for find- ing the OSG and it s various components.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used for this (see
find_library() CMake documentation).</p>

<p>&lt;MODULE&gt;_DIR (where MODULE is of the form
&quot;OSGVOLUME&quot; and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake
file) OSG_DIR OSGDIR OSG_ROOT</p>

<p>[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variable OSG_DIR can now be
used as well to influence detection, instead of needing to
specify an environment variable.</p>

<p>This module defines the following output variables:</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND - Was the OSG and all of the
specified components found?</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION - The version of the OSG which
was found</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the
headers</p>

<p>OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES - The OSG libraries</p>

<p>================================== Example Usage:</p>

<p>find_package(OpenSceneGraph 2.0.0 REQUIRED osgDB
osgUtil) # libOpenThreads &amp; libosg automatically
searched
include_directories(${OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS})</p>

<p>add_executable(foo foo.cc) target_link_libraries(foo
${OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>FindOpenThreads</p>

<p>OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library. Its
largest user- base seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might
notice I accept OSGDIR as an environment path. I consider
this part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
components. Each component is separate and you must opt in
to each module.</p>

<p>Locate OpenThreads This module defines
OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try
to link to OpenThreads OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to
find the headers</p>

<p>$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would
corre- spond to the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR
used in building osg.</p>

<p>[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variables OPENTHREADS_DIR or
OSG_DIR can now be used as well to influence detection,
instead of need- ing to specify an environment variable.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindPHP4 Find PHP4</p>

<p>This module finds if PHP4 is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PHP4_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where php.h can be found
PHP4_EXECUTABLE = full path to the php4 binary</p>

<p>FindPNG Find the native PNG includes and library</p>

<p>This module searches libpng, the library for working
with PNG images.</p>

<p>It defines the following variables</p>

<p>PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find png.h, etc.
PNG_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use PNG.
PNG_DEFINITIONS - You should
add_definitons(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code
that includes png library files. PNG_FOUND, If false, do not
try to use PNG. PNG_VERSION_STRING - the version of the PNG
library found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>Also defined, but not for general use are</p>

<p>PNG_LIBRARY, where to find the PNG library.</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the variable PNG_INCLUDE_DIR
is also set. It has the same value as PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS.</p>

<p>Since PNG depends on the ZLib compression library, none
of the above will be defined unless ZLib can be found.</p>

<p>FindPackageHandleStandardArgs</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt; ... )</p>

<p>This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake
modules files. It handles the REQUIRED, QUIET and
version-related argu- ments to find_package(). It also sets
the &lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND variable. The package is
considered found if all variables &lt;var1&gt;... listed
contain valid results, e.g. valid filepaths.</p>

<p>There are two modes of this function. The first argument
in both modes is the name of the Find-module where it is
called (in original casing).</p>

<p>The first simple mode looks like this:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(&lt;name&gt;
(DEFAULT_MSG|&quot;Custom failure message&quot;)
&lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt; )</p>

<p>If the variables &lt;var1&gt; to &lt;varN&gt; are all
valid, then &lt;UPPER- CASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND will be set to
TRUE. If DEFAULT_MSG is given as second argument, then the
function will generate itself use- ful success and error
messages. You can also supply a custom error message for the
failure case. This is not recommended.</p>

<p>The second mode is more powerful and also supports
version checking:</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME [FOUND_VAR
&lt;resultVar&gt;] [REQUIRED_VARS
&lt;var1&gt;...&lt;varN&gt;] [VERSION_VAR
&lt;versionvar&gt;] [HANDLE_COMPONENTS] [CONFIG_MODE]
[FAIL_MESSAGE &quot;Custom failure message&quot;] )</p>

<p>In this mode, the name of the result-variable can be set
either to either &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND or
&lt;OriginalCase_Name&gt;_FOUND using the FOUND_VAR option.
Other names for the result-variable are not allowed. So for
a Find-module named FindFooBar.cmake, the two possible names
are FooBar_FOUND and FOOBAR_FOUND. It is recommended to use
the original case version. If the FOUND_VAR option is not
used, the default is &lt;UPPERCASED_NAME&gt;_FOUND.</p>

<p>As in the simple mode, if &lt;var1&gt; through
&lt;varN&gt; are all valid, &lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND will
be set to TRUE. After REQUIRED_VARS the variables which are
required for this package are listed. Fol- lowing
VERSION_VAR the name of the variable can be specified which
holds the version of the package which has been found. If
this is done, this version will be checked against the
(poten- tially) specified required version used in the
find_package() call. The EXACT keyword is also handled. The
default messages include information about the required
version and the version which has been actually found, both
if the version is ok or not. If the package supports
components, use the HANDLE_COMPONENTS option to enable
handling them. In this case, find_package_han-
dle_standard_args() will report which components have been
found and which are missing, and the
&lt;packagename&gt;_FOUND variable will be set to FALSE if
any of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed
after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS) are missing. Use the option
CONFIG_MODE if your FindXXX.cmake module is a wrapper for a
find_package(... NO_MODULE) call. In this case VERSION_VAR
will be set to &lt;NAME&gt;_VERSION and the macro will
automatically check whether the Config module was found. Via
FAIL_MESSAGE a custom failure message can be specified, if
this is not used, the default message will be displayed.</p>

<p>Example for mode 1:</p>

<p>find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG
LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)</p>

<p>LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both
LIBXML2_LIBRARY and LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also
LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE. If it is not found and
REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, independent
whether QUIET was used or not. If it is found, success will
be reported, including the content of &lt;var1&gt;. On
repeated Cmake runs, the same message wont be printed
again.</p>

<p>Example for mode 2:</p>

<p>find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXslt FOUND_VAR
LibXslt_FOUND REQUIRED_VARS LibXslt_LIBRARIES
LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS VERSION_VAR LibXslt_VERSION_STRING)</p>

<p>In this case, LibXslt is considered to be found if the
vari- able(s) listed after REQUIRED_VAR are all valid, i.e.
LibXslt_LIBRARIES and LibXslt_INCLUDE_DIRS in this case. The
result will then be stored in LibXslt_FOUND . Also the
version of LibXslt will be checked by using the version
contained in LibXslt_VERSION_STRING. Since no FAIL_MESSAGE
is given, the default messages will be printed.</p>

<p>Another example for mode 2:</p>

<p>find_package(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS
/opt/automoc4) find_package_handle_standard_args(Automoc4
CONFIG_MODE)</p>

<p>In this case, FindAutmoc4.cmake wraps a call to
find_pack- age(Automoc4 NO_MODULE) and adds an additional
search directory for automoc4. Here the result will be
stored in AUTOMOC4_FOUND. The following
FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS() call produces a proper
success/error message.</p>

<p>FindPackageMessage</p>

<p>FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(&lt;name&gt; &quot;message for
user&quot; &quot;find result details&quot;)</p>

<p>This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake
modules files. It will print a message once for each unique
find result. This is useful for telling the user where a
package was found. The first argument specifies the name
(XXX) of the package. The second argument specifies the
message to display. The third argument lists details about
the find result so that if they change the message will be
displayed again. The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to
the find_package command.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>if(X11_FOUND) FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(X11 &quot;Found X11:
${X11_X11_LIB}&quot;
&quot;[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]&quot;) else() ...
endif()</p>

<p>FindPerl Find perl</p>

<p>this module looks for Perl</p>

<p>PERL_EXECUTABLE - the full path to perl PERL_FOUND - If
false, dont attempt to use perl. PERL_VERSION_STRING -
version of perl found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindPerlLibs Find Perl libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if PERL is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PERLLIBS_FOUND = True if perl.h &amp; libperl were found
PERL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where perl.h is found
PERL_LIBRARY = path to libperl PERL_EXECUTABLE = full path
to the perl binary</p>

<p>The minimum required version of Perl can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(PerlLibs
6.0)</p>

<p>The following variables are also available if needed
(introduced after CMake 2.6.4)</p>

<p>PERL_SITESEARCH = path to the sitesearch install dir
PERL_SITELIB = path to the sitelib install directory
PERL_VENDORARCH = path to the vendor arch install directory
PERL_VENDORLIB = path to the vendor lib install directory
PERL_ARCHLIB = path to the arch lib install directory
PERL_PRIVLIB = path to the priv lib install directory
PERL_EXTRA_C_FLAGS = Compilation flags used to build
perl</p>

<p>FindPhysFS</p>

<p>Locate PhysFS library This module defines
PHYSFS_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
PHYSFS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to PHYSFS
PHYSFS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find physfs.h</p>

<p>$PHYSFSDIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PHYSFSDIR used in
building PHYSFS.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindPike Find Pike</p>

<p>This module finds if PIKE is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where program.h is found
PIKE_EXECUTABLE = full path to the pike binary</p>

<p>FindPkgConfig a pkg-config module for CMake</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for all the given
modules</p>

<p>pkg_search_module(&lt;PREFIX&gt; [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
&lt;MODULE&gt; [&lt;MODULE&gt;]*) checks for given modules
and uses the first working one</p>

<p>When the REQUIRED argument was set, macros will fail
with an error when module(s) could not be found</p>

<p>When the QUIET argument is set, no status messages will
be printed.</p>

<p>It sets the following variables:</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_FOUND ... if pkg-config executable was found
PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE ... pathname of the pkg-config program
PKG_CONFIG_VERSION_STRING ... the version of the pkg-config
program found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>For the following variables two sets of values exist;
first one is the common one and has the given PREFIX. The
second set con- tains flags which are given out when
pkgconfig was called with the --static option.</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_FOUND ... set to 1 if module(s) exist
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARIES ... only the libraries (w/o the
-l) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBRARY_DIRS ... the paths of the
libraries (w/o the -L) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS ... all
required linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LDFLAGS_OTHER ... all
other linker flags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS ... the -I
preprocessor flags (w/o the -I) &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS ...
all required cflags &lt;XPREFIX&gt;_CFLAGS_OTHER ... the
other compiler flags</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; for common case
&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_STATIC for static
linking</p>

<p>There are some special variables whose prefix depends on
the count of given modules. When there is only one module,
&lt;PREFIX&gt; stays unchanged. When there are multiple
modules, the prefix will be changed to
&lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;:</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_VERSION ... version of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_PREFIX ... prefix-directory of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_INCLUDEDIR ... include-dir of the module
&lt;XPREFIX&gt;_LIBDIR ... lib-dir of the module</p>

<p>&lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt; when |MODULES| == 1,
else &lt;XPREFIX&gt; = &lt;PREFIX&gt;_&lt;MODNAME&gt;</p>

<p>A &lt;MODULE&gt; parameter can have the following
formats:</p>

<p>{MODNAME} ... matches any version
{MODNAME}&gt;={VERSION} ... at least version &lt;VERSION&gt;
is required {MODNAME}={VERSION} ... exactly version
&lt;VERSION&gt; is required {MODNAME}&lt;={VERSION} ...
modules must not be newer than &lt;VERSION&gt;</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0)</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0&gt;=2.10) requires at
least version 2.10 of glib2 and defines e.g.
GLIB2_VERSION=2.10.3</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (FOO glib-2.0&gt;=2.10 gtk+-2.0)
requires both glib2 and gtk2, and defines e.g.
FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION=2.10.3 FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION=2.8.20</p>

<p>pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender) defines
e.g.: XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11
XRENDER_STATIC_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11;pthread;Xau;Xdmcp</p>

<p>pkg_search_module (BAR libxml-2.0 libxml2
libxml&gt;=2)</p>

<p>FindPostgreSQL Find the PostgreSQL installation.</p>

<p>In Windows, we make the assumption that, if the
PostgreSQL files are installed, the default directory will
be C:Program FilesPostgreSQL.</p>

<p>This module defines</p>

<p>PostgreSQL_LIBRARIES - the PostgreSQL libraries needed
for linking PostgreSQL_INCLUDE_DIRS - the directories of the
PostgreSQL headers PostgreSQL_VERSION_STRING - the version
of PostgreSQL found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>FindProducer</p>

<p>Though Producer isn t directly part of OpenSceneGraph,
its pri- mary user is OSG so I consider this part of the
Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Youll
notice that I accept OSGDIR as an environment path.</p>

<p>Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
module. You must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as
these mod- ules wont do it for you. This is to allow you
control over your own system piece by piece in case you need
to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior
for a particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesnt work with your system as an
example). If you want to use a more convenient module that
includes everything, use the FindOpen- SceneGraph.cmake
instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.</p>

<p>Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY
PRO- DUCER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Producer
PRO- DUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>

<p>$PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in
building osg.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindProtobuf</p>

<p>Locate and configure the Google Protocol Buffers
library.</p>

<p>The following variables can be set and are optional:</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_SRC_ROOT_FOLDER - When compiling with MSVC, if
this cache variable is set the protobuf-default VS project
build locations (vsprojects/Debug &amp; vsprojects/Release)
will be searched for libraries and binaries.</p>

<p>PROTOBUF_IMPORT_DIRS - List of additional directories to

<p>FindPythonInterp Find python interpreter</p>

<p>This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and
deter- mines where the executables are. This code sets the
following variables:</p>

<p>PYTHONINTERP_FOUND - Was the Python executable found
PYTHON_EXECUTABLE - path to the Python interpreter</p>

<p>PYTHON_VERSION_STRING - Python version found e.g. 2.5.2
PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR - Python major version found e.g. 2
PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR - Python minor version found e.g. 5
PYTHON_VERSION_PATCH - Python patch version found e.g. 2</p>

<p>The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to
specify a list of version numbers that should be taken into
account when searching for Python. You need to set this
variable before call- ing find_package(PythonInterp).</p>

<p>FindPythonLibs Find python libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if Python is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>PYTHONLIBS_FOUND - have the Python libs been found
PYTHON_LIBRARIES - path to the python library
PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH - path to where Python.h is found
(deprecated) PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS - path to where Python.h is
found PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES - path to the debug library
(deprecated) PYTHONLIBS_VERSION_STRING - version of the
Python libs found (since CMake 2.8.8)</p>

<p>The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to
specify a list of version numbers that should be taken into
account when searching for Python. You need to set this
variable before call- ing find_package(PythonLibs).</p>

<p>If youd like to specify the installation of Python to
use, you should modify the following cache variables:</p>

<p>PYTHON_LIBRARY - path to the python library
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR - path to where Python.h is found</p>

<p>FindQt Searches for all installed versions of Qt.</p>

<p>This should only be used if your project can work with
multiple versions of Qt. If not, you should just directly
use FindQt4 or FindQt3. If multiple versions of Qt are found
on the machine, then The user must set the option
DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the ver- sion they want to use. If
only one version of qt is found on the machine, then the
DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching
FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user sets
DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is
included.</p>

<p>QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can not
find Qt4 or Qt3 an error is raised and a message is sent to
the user.</p>

<p>DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created QT4_INSTALLED is
set to TRUE if qt4 is found. QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if
qt3 is found.</p>

<p>FindQt3 Locate Qt include paths and libraries</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>QT_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find qt.h, etc. QT_LIBRARIES -
the libraries to link against to use Qt. QT_DEFINITIONS -
definitions to use when compiling code that uses Qt.
QT_FOUND - If false, dont try to use Qt. QT_VERSION_STRING -
the version of Qt found</p>

<p>If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set
QT_MT_REQUIRED to TRUE</p>

<p>Also defined, but not for general use are:</p>

<p>QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain library. This is
only required by Qt3 on Windows.</p>

<p>FindQt4 Find Qt 4</p>

<p>This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important
issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system
path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything
else. This module defines a number of key variables and
macros. The variable QT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to
a CMake file that can be included to compile Qt 4
applications and libraries. It sets up the compilation
environment for include directories, preprocessor defines
and populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.</p>

<p>Typical usage could be something like:</p>

<p>find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtCore QtGui QtXml)
include(${QT_USE_FILE}) add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>The minimum required version can be specified using the
standard find_package()-syntax (see example above). For
compatibility with older versions of FindQt4.cmake it is
also possible to set the variable QT_MIN_VERSION to the
minimum required version of Qt4 before the find_package(Qt4)
command. If both are used, the version used in the
find_package() command overrides the one from
QT_MIN_VERSION.</p>

<p>When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables
are automatically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up. If one
wishes to manually set them, the available ones to set
include:</p>

<p>QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE QT_DONT_USE_QTGUI QT_USE_QT3SUPPORT
QT_USE_QTASSISTANT QT_USE_QAXCONTAINER QT_USE_QAXSERVER
QT_USE_QTDESIGNER QT_USE_QTMOTIF QT_USE_QTMAIN
QT_USE_QTMULTIMEDIA QT_USE_QTNETWORK QT_USE_QTNSPLUGIN
QT_USE_QTOPENGL QT_USE_QTSQL QT_USE_QTXML QT_USE_QTSVG
QT_USE_QTTEST QT_USE_QTUITOOLS QT_USE_QTDBUS QT_USE_QTSCRIPT
QT_USE_QTASSISTANTCLIENT QT_USE_QTHELP QT_USE_QTWEBKIT
QT_USE_QTXMLPATTERNS QT_USE_PHONON QT_USE_QTSCRIPTTOOLS
QT_USE_QTDECLARATIVE</p>

<p>QT_USE_IMPORTED_TARGETS If this variable is set to TRUE,
FindQt4.cmake will create imported library targets for the
various Qt libraries and set the library variables like
QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY to point at these imported targets instead
of the library file on disk. This provides much better
handling of the release and debug versions of the Qt
libraries and is also always backwards compatible, except
for the case that dependencies of libraries are exported,
these will then also list the names of the imported targets
as dependency and not the file location on disk. This is
much more flexible, but requires that FindQt4.cmake is
executed before such an exported dependency file is
processed.</p>

<p>Note that if using IMPORTED targets, the qtmain.lib
static library is automatically linked on Windows. To
disable that globally, set the QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN variable
before finding Qt4. To disable that for a particular
executable, set the QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN target property to
True on the executable.</p>

<p>QT_INCLUDE_DIRS_NO_SYSTEM If this variable is set to
TRUE, the Qt include directories in the QT_USE_FILE will NOT
have the SYSTEM keyword set.</p>

<p>There are also some files that need processing by some
Qt tools such as moc and uic. Listed below are macros that
may be used to process those files.</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class
with the Q_OBJECT declaration. Per-directory preprocessor
definitions are also added. Options may be given to moc,
such as those found when executing &quot;moc
-help&quot;.</p>

<p>macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
create code from a list of Qt designer ui files. Options may
be given to uic, such as those found when executing
&quot;uic -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS
...) create code from a list of Qt resource files. Options
may be given to rcc, such as those found when executing
&quot;rcc -help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile ) creates a
rule to run moc on infile and create outfile. Use this if
for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isnt appropriate, e.g.
because you need a custom filename for the moc file or
something similar.</p>

<p>macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... ) The
qt4_automoc macro is obsolete. Use the CMAKE_AUTOMOC feature
instead. This macro is still experimental. It can be used to
have moc automatically handled. So if you have the files
foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a a class uses the Q_OBJECT
macro, moc has to run on it. If you dont want to use
QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can
insert #include &quot;foo.moc&quot; in foo.cpp and then give
foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the scan all
listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and
if it finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at
build time on the accompanying header file foo.h. If a
source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be
ignored by this macro.</p>

<p>You should have a look on the AUTOMOC property for
targets to achieve the same results.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface
basename) Create the interface header and implementation
files with the given basename from the given interface xml
file and add it to the list of sources.</p>

<p>You can pass additional parameters to the qdbusxml2cpp
call by setting properties on the input file:</p>

<p>INCLUDE the given file will be included in the generate
interface header</p>

<p>CLASSNAME the generated class is named accordingly</p>

<p>NO_NAMESPACE the generated class is not wrapped in a
namespace</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
Create the interface header and implementation files for all
listed interface xml files. The basename will be
automatically determined from the name of the xml file.</p>

<p>The source file properties described for
QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE also apply here.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader
parentclassname [basename] [classname]) create a dbus
adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources.
The adaptor forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in
parentheader and named parentclassname. The name of the
generated files will be &lt;basename&gt;adaptor.{cpp,h}
where basename defaults to the basename of the xml file. If
&lt;classname&gt; is provided, then it will be used as the
classname of the adaptor itself.</p>

<p>macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header
[interfacename] OPTIONS ...) generate the xml interface file
from the given header. If the optional argument
interfacename is omitted, the name of the interface file is
constructed from the basename of the header with the suffix
.xml appended. Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as
those found when executing &quot;qdbuscpp2xml
--help&quot;</p>

<p>macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ...
sources ... ts_files ... OPTIONS ...) out: qm_files in:
directories sources ts_files options: flags to pass to
lupdate, such as -extensions to specify extensions for a
directory scan. generates commands to create .ts (vie
lupdate) and .qm (via lrelease) - files from directories
and/or sources. The ts files are created and/or updated in
the source tree (unless given with full paths). The qm files
are generated in the build tree. Updating the translations
can be done by adding the qm_files to the source list of
your library/executable, so they are always updated, or by
adding a custom target to control when they get
updated/generated.</p>

<p>macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... ) out:
qm_files in: ts_files generates commands to create .qm from
.ts - files. The generated filenames can be found in
qm_files. The ts_files must exist and are not updated in any
way.</p>

<p>function QT4_USE_MODULES( target [link_type]
modules...)</p>

<p>This function is obsolete. Use target_link_libraries
with IMPORTED targets instead. Make &lt;target&gt; use the
&lt;modules&gt; from Qt. Using a Qt module means to link to
the library, add the relevant include directories for the
module, and add the relevant compiler defines for using the
module. Modules are roughly equivalent to components of Qt4,
so usage would be something like: qt4_use_modules(myexe Core
Gui Declarative) to use QtCore, QtGui and QtDeclarative. The
optional &lt;link_type&gt; argument can be specified as
either LINK_PUBLIC or LINK_PRIVATE to specify the same
argument to the target_link_libraries call.</p>

<p>Below is a detailed list of variables that FindQt4.cmake
sets. QT_FOUND If false, dont try to use Qt. Qt4_FOUND If
false, dont try to use Qt 4. QT4_FOUND If false, dont try to
use Qt 4. This variable is for compatibility only.</p>

Carbon is used. In general, this should not be used, but its
useful when having platform specific code.</p>

<p>QT_DEFINITIONS Definitions to use when compiling code
that uses Qt. You do not need to use this if you include
QT_USE_FILE. The QT_USE_FILE will also define QT_DEBUG and
QT_NO_DEBUG to fit your current build type. Those are not
contained in QT_DEFINITIONS.</p>

<p>QT_INCLUDES List of paths to all include directories of
Qt4 QT_INCLUDE_DIR and QT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR are always in
this variable even if NOTFOUND, all other INCLUDE_DIRS are
only added if they are found. You do not need to use this if
you include QT_USE_FILE.</p>

<p>QT_QT_LIBRARY Qt-Library is now split</p>

<p>FindQuickTime</p>

<p>Locate QuickTime This module defines QUICKTIME_LIBRARY
QUICK- TIME_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to gdal
QUICK- TIME_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers</p>

<p>$QUICKTIME_DIR is an environment variable that would
correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$QUICKTIME_DIR</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing.</p>

<p>FindRTI Try to find M&amp;S HLA RTI libraries</p>

<p>This module finds if any HLA RTI is installed and
locates the standard RTI include files and libraries.</p>

<p>RTI is a simulation infrastructure standardized by IEEE
and SISO. It has a well defined C++ API that assures that
simulation applications are independent on a particular RTI
implementation.</p>


<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Infrastructure_(simulation)</p>

<p>This code sets the following variables:</p>

<p>RTI_INCLUDE_DIR = the directory where RTI includes file
are found RTI_LIBRARIES = The libraries to link against to
use RTI RTI_DEFINITIONS = -DRTI_USES_STD_FSTREAM RTI_FOUND =
Set to FALSE if any HLA RTI was not found</p>

<p>Report problems to &lt;certi-devel@nongnu.org&gt;</p>

<p>FindRuby Find Ruby</p>

<p>This module finds if Ruby is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. Ruby 1.8 and 1.9
are supported.</p>

<p>The minimum required version of Ruby can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(Ruby 1.8)</p>

<p>It also determines what the name of the library is. This
code sets the following variables:</p>

<p>RUBY_EXECUTABLE = full path to the ruby binary
RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS = include dirs to be used when using the
ruby library RUBY_LIBRARY = full path to the ruby library
RUBY_VERSION = the version of ruby which was found, e.g.
&quot;1.8.7&quot; RUBY_FOUND = set to true if ruby ws found
successfully</p>

<p>RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH = same as RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS, only
provided for compatibility reasons, dont use it</p>

<p>FindSDL Locate SDL library</p>

<p>This module defines</p>

<p>SDL_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h SDL_VERSION_STRING,
human-readable string containing the version of SDL</p>

<p>This module responds to the the flag:</p>

<p>SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY If this is defined, then no
SDL_main will be linked in because only applications need
main(). Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an
application and this module will attempt to locate and set
the the proper link flags as part of the returned
SDL_LIBRARY variable.</p>

<p>Dont forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your
project for the OS X framework based version. (Other
versions link to -lSDL- main which this module will try to
find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this module will
automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.</p>

<p>Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in
your configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did
not find your SDL library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so,
SDL.framework, etc). Set SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your
SDL library, and configure again. Similarly, if you see an
empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as
appropriate. These values are used to generate the final
SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset,
SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.
l.e.galup 9-20-02</p>

<p>Modified by Eric Wing. Added code to assist with
automated building by using environmental variables and
providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc). Also corrected the
header search path to follow &quot;proper&quot; SDL
guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by
some platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed
by some platforms. Added needed compile switches for
MinGW.</p>

<p>On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if
found) over others. People will have to manually change the
cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or
set the CMake environ- ment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the
search paths.</p>

<p>Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to
just SDL.h This needed to change because &quot;proper&quot;
SDL convention is #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;, not
&lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;. This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see
FreeBSD).</p>

<p>FindSDL_image Locate SDL_image library</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_IMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_image</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLIMAGE_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES)
SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
SDLIMAGE_FOUND (same value as SDL_IMAGE_FOUND)</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the

X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).</p>

<p>FindSDL_mixer Locate SDL_mixer library</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_MIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_MIXER_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_mixer</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLMIXER_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES)
SDLMIXER_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS)
SDLMIXER_FOUND (same value as SDL_MIXER_FOUND)</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the
FindSDL.cmake module, but with modifications to recognize OS
X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).</p>

<p>FindSDL_net Locate SDL_net library</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>SDL_NET_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_NET_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_NET_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_net</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLNET_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_NET_LIBRARIES)
SDLNET_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS)
SDLNET_FOUND (same value as SDL_NET_FOUND)</p>

<p>FindSDL_sound Locates the SDL_sound library</p>

<p>This module depends on SDL being found and must be
called AFTER FindSDL.cmake is called.</p>

<p>This module defines</p>

<p>SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL_sound
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries
that you need to link against. This is a read-only variable
and is marked INTERNAL. SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an
optional variable for you to add your own flags to
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is available mostly for cases this
module failed to anticipate for and you must add additional
flags. This is marked as ADVANCED. SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING,
human-readable string containing the version of
SDL_sound</p>

<p>This module also defines (but you shouldn t need to use
directly)</p>

<p>SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound
library you would link against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for
you link instructions and not this one.</p>

<p>And might define the following as needed</p>

<p>MIKMOD_LIBRARY MODPLUG_LIBRARY OGG_LIBRARY
VORBIS_LIBRARY SMPEG_LIBRARY FLAC_LIBRARY SPEEX_LIBRARY</p>

<p>Typically, you should not use these variables directly,
and you should use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains
SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other audio libraries (if needed)
to successfully com- pile on your system.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This module is a bit more
complicated than the other FindSDL* family modules. The
reason is that SDL_sound can be compiled in a large variety
of different ways which are independent of platform.
SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party
libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg
Vorbis, SMPEG, ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and poten-
tially others. Under some circumstances which I dont fully
understand, there seems to be a requirement that dependent
libraries of libraries you use must also be explicitly
linked against in order to successfully compile. SDL_sound
does not currently have any system in place to know how it
was compiled. So this CMake module does the hard work in
trying to discover which 3rd party libraries are required
for building (if any). This module uses a brute force
approach to create a test program that uses SDL_sound, and
then tries to build it. If the build fails, it parses the
error output for known symbol names to fig- ure out which
libraries are needed.</p>

<p>Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental
variable that would correspond to the ./configure
--prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.</p>

<p>On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if
found) over others. People will have to manually change the
cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to override this selectionor set
the CMake environ- ment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the
search paths.</p>

<p>FindSDL_ttf Locate SDL_ttf library</p>

<p>This module defines:</p>

<p>SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link
against SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
SDL_TTF_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
SDL_TTF_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing
the version of SDL_ttf</p>

<p>For backward compatiblity the following variables are
also set:</p>

<p>SDLTTF_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES)
SDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)
SDLTTF_FOUND (same value as SDL_TTF_FOUND)</p>

<p>$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond
to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.</p>

<p>Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the
FindSDL.cmake module, but with modifications to recognize OS
X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).</p>

<p>FindSWIG Find SWIG</p>

<p>This module finds an installed SWIG. It sets the
following variables:</p>

<p>SWIG_FOUND - set to true if SWIG is found SWIG_DIR - the
directory where swig is installed SWIG_EXECUTABLE - the path
to the swig executable SWIG_VERSION - the version number of
the swig executable</p>

<p>The minimum required version of SWIG can be specified
using the standard syntax, e.g. find_package(SWIG 1.1)</p>

<p>All information is collected from the SWIG_EXECUTABLE so
the version to be found can be changed from the command line
by means of setting SWIG_EXECUTABLE</p>

<p>FindSelfPackers Find upx</p>

<p>This module looks for some executable packers (i.e.
software that compress executables or shared libs into
on-the-fly self-extracting executables or shared libs.
Examples:</p>

<p>UPX: http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html</p>

<p>FindSquish -- Typical Use</p>

<p>This module can be used to find Squish. Currently Squish
ver- sions 3 and 4 are supported.</p>

<p>SQUISH_FOUND If false, don t try to use Squish
SQUISH_VERSION The full version of Squish found
SQUISH_VERSION_MAJOR The major version of Squish found
SQUISH_VERSION_MINOR The minor version of Squish found
SQUISH_VERSION_PATCH The patch version of Squish found</p>

<p>SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR The Squish installation directory
(containing bin, lib, etc) SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE The
squishserver executable SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE The
squishrunner executable</p>

<p>SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR_FOUND Was the install directory
found? SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE_FOUND Was the server
executable found? SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE_FOUND Was the
client executable found?</p>

<p>It provides the function squish_v4_add_test() for adding
a squish test to cmake using Squish 4.x:</p>

<p>squish_v4_add_test(cmakeTestName AUT targetName SUITE
suiteName TEST squishTestName [SETTINGSGROUP group]
[PRE_COMMAND command] [POST_COMMAND command] )</p>

<p>The arguments have the following meaning:</p>

<p>cmakeTestName: this will be used as the first argument
for add_test() AUT targetName: the name of the cmake target
which will be used as AUT, i.e. the executable which will be
tested. SUITE suiteName: this is either the full path to the
squish suite, or just the last directory of the suite, i.e.
the suite name. In this case the CMakeLists.txt which calls
squish_add_test() must be located in the parent directory of
the suite directory. TEST squishTestName: the name of the
squish test, i.e. the name of the subdirectory of the test
inside the suite directory. SETTINGSGROUP group: if
specified, the given settings group will be used for
executing the test. If not specified, the groupname will be
&quot;CTest_&lt;username&gt;&quot; PRE_COMMAND command: if
specified, the given command will be executed before
starting the squish test. POST_COMMAND command: same as
PRE_COMMAND, but after the squish test has been
executed.</p>

<p>enable_testing() find_package(Squish 4.0) if
(SQUISH_FOUND) squish_v4_add_test(myTestName AUT myApp SUITE
${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/mySuite TEST someSquishTest
SETTINGSGROUP myGroup ) endif ()</p>

<p>For users of Squish version 3.x the macro
squish_v3_add_test() is provided:</p>

<p>squish_v3_add_test(testName applicationUnderTest
testCase envVars testWrapper) Use this macro to add a test
using Squish 3.x.</p>

<p>enable_testing() find_package(Squish) if (SQUISH_FOUND)
squish_v3_add_test(myTestName myApplication testCase envVars
testWrapper) endif ()</p>

<p>macro SQUISH_ADD_TEST(testName applicationUnderTest
testCase envVars testWrapper)</p>

<p>This is deprecated. Use SQUISH_V3_ADD_TEST() if you are
using Squish 3.x instead.</p>

<p>FindSubversion Extract information from a subversion
working copy</p>

<p>The module defines the following variables:</p>

<p>Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line
client Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line
client Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client
was found SUBVERSION_FOUND - same as Subversion_FOUND, set
for compatiblity reasons</p>

<p>The minimum required version of Subversion can be
specified using the standard syntax, e.g.
find_package(Subversion 1.4)</p>

<p>If the command line client executable is found two
macros are defined:</p>

<p>Subversion_WC_INFO(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)
Subversion_WC_LOG(&lt;dir&gt; &lt;var-prefix&gt;)</p>

<p>Subversion_WC_INFO extracts information of a subversion
working copy at a given location. This macro defines the
following vari- ables:</p>

<p>&lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_URL - url of the repository (at
&lt;dir&gt;) &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_ROOT - root url of the
repository &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_REVISION - current revision
&lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_AUTHOR - author of last
commit &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_DATE - date of
last commit &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_LAST_CHANGED_REV -
revision of last commit &lt;var-prefix&gt;_WC_INFO - output
of command svn info &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p>Subversion_WC_LOG retrieves the log message of the base
revision of a subversion working copy at a given location.
This macro defines the variable:</p>

<p>&lt;var-prefix&gt;_LAST_CHANGED_LOG - last log of base
revision</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>find_package(Subversion) if(SUBVERSION_FOUND)
Subversion_WC_INFO(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
message(&quot;Current revision is
${Project_WC_REVISION}&quot;)
Subversion_WC_LOG(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
message(&quot;Last changed log is
${Project_LAST_CHANGED_LOG}&quot;) endif()</p>

<p>FindTCL TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.</p>

<p>This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are. It also
determines what the name of the library is. This code sets
the following variables:</p>

<p>TCL_FOUND = Tcl was found TK_FOUND = Tk was found
TCLTK_FOUND = Tcl and Tk were found TCL_LIBRARY = path to
Tcl library (tcl tcl80) TCL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where
tcl.h can be found TCL_TCLSH = path to tclsh binary (tcl
tcl80) TK_LIBRARY = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
TK_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where tk.h can be found TK_WISH =
full path to the wish executable</p>

<p>In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some
issues for people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk
gurus/developpers, some variables were moved or removed.
Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:</p>

<p>=&gt; they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk
extensions. =&gt; these libs are not packaged by default
with Tcl/Tk distributions. Even when Tcl/Tk is built from
source, several flavors of debug libs are created and there
is no real reason to pick a single one specifically (say,
amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx). Let s leave that
choice to the user by allowing him to assign TCL_LIBRARY to
any Tcl library, debug or not. =&gt; this ended up being
only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of confusion
regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal
path at this point it is safer you ask directly where the
*source* tree is and dig from there.</p>

<p>FindTIFF Find TIFF library</p>

<p>Find the native TIFF includes and library This module
defines</p>

TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.</p>

<p>This module finds Tcl stub libraries. It first finds Tcl
include files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake. How to
Use the Tcl Stubs Library:</p>

<p>http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html</p>

<p>Using Stub Libraries:</p>

<p>http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3</p>

<p>This code sets the following variables:</p>

<p>TCL_STUB_LIBRARY = path to Tcl stub library

is either the root of the build tree, or the lib/vtk
directory. This is the only cache entry.</p>

<p>The following variables are set for backward
compatibility and should not be used in new code:</p>

<p>USE_VTK_FILE - The full path to the UseVTK.cmake file.
This is provided for backward compatibility. Use
VTK_USE_FILE instead.</p>

<p>Findosg</p>

<p>NOTE: It is highly recommended that you use the new
FindOpen- SceneGraph.cmake introduced in CMake 2.6.3 and not
use this Find module directly.</p>

<p>This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find
OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and
you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into
OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these
modules wont do it for you. This is to allow you control
over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a
particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn t work with your system as an
example). If you want to use a more convenient module that
includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake
instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.</p>

<p>Locate osg This module defines</p>

<p>OSG_FOUND - Was the Osg found? OSG_INCLUDE_DIR - Where

OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and
you must opt in to each module. You must also opt into

modules wont do it for you. This is to allow you control
over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a
particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesnt work with your system as an
example). If you want to use a more convenient module that

<p>This CMake file contains two macros to assist with
searching for OSG libraries and nodekits. Please see
FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake for full documentation.</p>

<p>FindwxWidgets Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows)
installation.</p>

<p>This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects
a default configuration to use. wxWidgets is a modular
library. To specify the modules that you will use, you need
to name them as components to the package:</p>

<p>find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS core base ...)</p>

<p>There are two search branches: a windows style and a
unix style. For windows, the following variables are
searched for and set to defaults in case of multiple
choices. Change them if the defaults are not desired (i.e.,
these are the only variables you should change to select a
configuration):</p>

<p>wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR - Base wxWidgets directory (e.g.,
C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3). wxWidgets_LIB_DIR - Path to wxWidgets
libraries (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use (e.g., msw,
mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES - Set to TRUE to exclude
linking of commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff jpeg zlib
regex expat).</p>

<p>For unix style it uses the wx-config utility. You can
select between debug/release, unicode/ansi,
universal/non-universal, and static/shared in the QtDialog
or ccmake interfaces by turn- ing ON/OFF the following
variables:</p>

<p>wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL wxWidgets_USE_STATIC</p>

<p>There is also a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for
all other options that need to be passed to the wx-config
utility. For example, to use the base toolkit found in the
/usr/local path, set the variable (before calling the
FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:</p>

<p>set(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS --toolkit=base
--prefix=/usr)</p>

<p>The following are set after the configuration is done
for both windows and unix style:</p>

<p>wxWidgets_FOUND - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS - Include directories for WIN32 i.e.,
where to find &quot;wx/wx.h&quot; and
&quot;wx/setup.h&quot;; possibly empty for unices.
wxWidgets_LIBRARIES - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS - compile time link dirs, useful for
rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string in WIN32
environment. wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS - Contains defines
required to compile/link against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to
compile/link against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS - Include dirs and compiler flags for
unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially &quot; wx-config
--cxxflags&quot;. wxWidgets_USE_FILE - Convenience include
file.</p>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<p># Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is
important! find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS net gl core
base) if(wxWidgets_FOUND) include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE}) #
and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt;
${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES}) endif()</p>

<p>If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional
part):</p>

<p>find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE}) # and for each of your
dependent executable/library targets:
target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt;
${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>FindwxWindows Find wxWindows (wxWidgets)
installation</p>

<p>This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed
and deter- mines where the include files and libraries are.
It also deter- mines what the name of the library is. Please
note this file is DEPRECATED and replaced by
FindwxWidgets.cmake. This code sets the following
variables:</p>

<p>WXWINDOWS_FOUND = system has WxWindows
WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries on
Unix/Linux with additional linker flags from &quot;wx-config
--libs&quot; CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS = Compiler flags for
wxWindows, essentially &quot; wx-config --cxxflags&quot; on
Linux WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR = where to find
&quot;wx/wx.h&quot; and &quot;wx/setup.h&quot;
WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for
rpath on Unix WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS = extra defines</p>

<p>OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please</p>

<p>set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)</p>

<p>in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this
file.</p>

<p>HAVE_ISYSTEM - true required to replace -I by -isystem
on g++</p>

<p>For convenience include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your
projects CMakeLists.txt using include(${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_LIST_DIR}/Use_wxWindows.cmake).</p>

<p>USAGE</p>

<p>set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1) find_package(wxWindows)</p>

<p>NOTES wxWidgets 2.6.x is supported for monolithic builds
e.g. compiled in wx/build/msw dir as:</p>

<p>nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug SHARED=0 USE_OPENGL=1
MONOLITHIC=1</p>

<p>FortranCInterface Fortran/C Interface Detection</p>

<p>This module automatically detects the API by which C and
Fortran languages interact. Variables indicate if the
mangling is found:</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND = Global subroutines and
functions FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND = Module
subroutines and functions (declared by &quot;MODULE
PROCEDURE&quot;)</p>

<p>A function is provided to generate a C header file
containing macros to mangle symbol names:</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_HEADER(&lt;file&gt; [MACRO_NAMESPACE
&lt;macro-ns&gt;] [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &lt;ns&gt;] [SYMBOLS
[&lt;module&gt;:]&lt;function&gt; ...])</p>

<p>It generates in &lt;file&gt; definitions of the
following macros:</p>

<p>#define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ... #define
FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ... #define
FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ... #define
FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...</p>

<p>These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols,
respec- tively:</p>

<p>- Global symbols without _: call mysub() - Global
symbols with _ : call my_sub() - Module symbols without _ :
use mymod; call mysub() - Module symbols with _ : use mymod;
call my_sub()</p>

<p>If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is
left unde- fined. All macros require raw names in both lower
case and upper case. The MACRO_NAMESPACE option replaces the
default &quot;FortranC- Interface_&quot; prefix with a given
namespace &quot;&lt;macro-ns&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>The SYMBOLS option lists symbols to mangle automatically
with C preprocessor definitions:</p>

<p>&lt;function&gt; ==&gt; #define
&lt;ns&gt;&lt;function&gt; ...
&lt;module&gt;:&lt;function&gt; ==&gt; #define
&lt;ns&gt;&lt;module&gt;_&lt;function&gt; ...</p>

<p>If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no
preproces- sor definition is created, and a warning is
displayed. The SYM- BOL_NAMESPACE option prefixes all
preprocessor definitions gen- erated by the SYMBOLS option
with a given namespace &quot;&lt;ns&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>include(FortranCInterface) FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h
MACRO_NAMESPACE &quot;FC_&quot;)</p>

<p>This creates a &quot;FC.h&quot; header that defines
mangling macros FC_GLOBAL(), FC_GLOBAL_(), FC_MODULE(), and
FC_MODULE_().</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<p>include(FortranCInterface)
FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h MACRO_NAMESPACE
&quot;FC_&quot; SYMBOL_NAMESPACE &quot;FC_&quot; SYMBOLS
mysub mymod:my_sub)</p>

<p>This creates a &quot;FCMangle.h&quot; header that
defines the same FC_*() mangling macros as the previous
example plus preprocessor sym- bols FC_mysub and
FC_mymod_my_sub.</p>

<p>Another function is provided to verify that the Fortran
and C/C++ compilers work together:</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])</p>

<p>It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran
and C (and C++ when the CXX option is given) compiles and
links suc- cessfully. The result is stored in the cache
entry FortranCIn- terface_VERIFIED_C (or
FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX if CXX is given) as a
boolean. If the check fails and QUIET is not given the
function terminates with a FATAL_ERROR message describing
the problem. The purpose of this check is to stop a build
early for incompatible compiler combinations. The test is
built in the Release configuration.</p>

<p>FortranCInterface is aware of possible GLOBAL and MODULE
man- glings for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides
an interface to specify new possible manglings. Set the
variables</p>

<p>FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS</p>

<p>before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings
of the symbols &quot;MySub&quot;, &quot;My_Sub&quot;,
&quot;MyModule:MySub&quot;, and &quot;My_Mod-
ule:My_Sub&quot;. For example, the code:</p>

<p>set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__
MYSUB_) # ^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^^
set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS __mymodule_MOD_mysub

<p>GNUInstallDirs Define GNU standard installation
directories</p>

<p>Provides install directory variables as defined for GNU
soft- ware:</p>


<p>http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html</p>

<p>Inclusion of this module defines the following
variables:</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt; - destination for files of a
given type CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt; - corresponding
absolute path</p>

<p>where &lt;dir&gt; is one of:</p>

<p>BINDIR - user executables (bin) SBINDIR - system admin
executables (sbin) LIBEXECDIR - program executables
(libexec) SYSCONFDIR - read-only single-machine data (etc)
SHAREDSTATEDIR - modifiable architecture-independent data
(com) LOCALSTATEDIR - modifiable single-machine data (var)
LIBDIR - object code libraries (lib or lib64 or
lib/&lt;multiarch-tuple&gt; on Debian) INCLUDEDIR - C header
files (include) OLDINCLUDEDIR - C header files for non-gcc
(/usr/include) DATAROOTDIR - read-only
architecture-independent data root (share) DATADIR -
read-only architecture-independent data (DATAROOTDIR)
INFODIR - info documentation (DATAROOTDIR/info) LOCALEDIR -
locale-dependent data (DATAROOTDIR/locale) MANDIR - man
documentation (DATAROOTDIR/man) DOCDIR - documentation root
(DATAROOTDIR/doc/PROJECT_NAME)</p>

<p>Each CMAKE_INSTALL_&lt;dir&gt; value may be passed to
the DESTINATION options of install() commands for the
corresponding file type. If the includer does not define a
value the above-shown default will be used and the value
will appear in the cache for editing by the user. Each
CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_&lt;dir&gt; value contains an absolute
path constructed from the corresponding destination by
prepending (if necessary) the value of
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>GenerateExportHeader Function for generation of export
macros for libraries</p>

<p>This module provides the function
GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() and the accompanying
ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS() function.</p>

<p>The GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER function can be used to
generate a file suitable for preprocessor inclusion which
contains EXPORT macros to be used in library classes.</p>

<p>GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET</p>

<p>[BASE_NAME &lt;base_name&gt;] [EXPORT_MACRO_NAME
&lt;export_macro_name&gt;] [EXPORT_FILE_NAME
&lt;export_file_name&gt;] [DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME
&lt;deprecated_macro_name&gt;] [NO_EXPORT_MACRO_NAME
&lt;no_export_macro_name&gt;] [STATIC_DEFINE
&lt;static_define&gt;] [NO_DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME
&lt;no_deprecated_macro_name&gt;] [DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED]
[PREFIX_NAME &lt;prefix_name&gt;]</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [&lt;output_variable&gt;]
)</p>

<p>By default GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER() generates macro
names in a file name determined by the name of the library.
The ADD_COM- PILER_EXPORT_FLAGS function adds
-fvisibility=hidden to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS if supported, and is
a no-op on Windows which does not need extra compiler flags
for exporting support. You may optionally pass a single
argument to ADD_COM- PILER_EXPORT_FLAGS that will be
populated with the required CXX_FLAGS required to enable
visibility support for the com- piler/architecture in
use.</p>

<p>This means that in the simplest case, users of these
functions will be equivalent to:</p>

<p>add_compiler_export_flags() add_library(somelib
someclass.cpp) generate_export_header(somelib)
install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
install(FILES someclass.h
${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION
${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR} )</p>

<p>And in the ABI header files:</p>

<p>#include &quot;somelib_export.h&quot; class
SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass { ... };</p>

<p>The CMake fragment will generate a file in the
${CMAKE_CUR- RENT_BINARY_DIR} called somelib_export.h
containing the macros SOMELIB_EXPORT, SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT,
SOMELIB_DEPRECATED, SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT and
SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT. The resulting file should be
installed with other headers in the library.</p>

<p>The BASE_NAME argument can be used to override the file
name and the names used for the macros</p>

<p>add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib BASE_NAME other_name )</p>

<p>Generates a file called other_name_export.h containing
the macros OTHER_NAME_EXPORT, OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT and
OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED etc.</p>

<p>The BASE_NAME may be overridden by specifiying other
options in the function. For example:</p>

<p>add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib EXPORT_MACRO_NAME
OTHER_NAME_EXPORT )</p>

<p>creates the macro OTHER_NAME_EXPORT instead of
SOMELIB_EXPORT, but other macros and the generated file name
is as default.</p>

<p>add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME
KDE_DEPRECATED )</p>

<p>creates the macro KDE_DEPRECATED instead of
SOMELIB_DEPRECATED.</p>

<p>If LIBRARY_TARGET is a static library, macros are
defined with- out values.</p>

<p>If the same sources are used to create both a shared and
a static library, the uppercased symbol
${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE should be used when building the
static library</p>

<p>add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})
generate_export_header(shared_variant BASE_NAME
libshared_and_static) set_target_properties(static_variant
PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS
-DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)</p>

<p>This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing
when building the static library.</p>

<p>If DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED is specified, then a macro
${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED will be defined This macro can be
used to remove deprecated code from preprocessor output.</p>

<p>option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED &quot;Exclude deprecated parts
of the library&quot; FALSE) if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)
set(NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED) endif()
generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})</p>

<p>And then in somelib:</p>

<p>class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass { public: #ifndef
SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED SOMELIB_DEPRECATED void oldMethod();
#endif };</p>

<p>#ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED void
SomeClass::oldMethod() { } #endif</p>

<p>If PREFIX_NAME is specified, the argument will be used
as a pre- fix to all generated macros.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>generate_export_header(somelib PREFIX_NAME VTK_)</p>

<p>Generates the macros VTK_SOMELIB_EXPORT etc.</p>

<p>GetPrerequisites Functions to analyze and list
executable file prerequisites.</p>

<p>This module provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib
or .so files that an executable or shared library file
depends on. (Its prerequisites.)</p>

<p>It uses various tools to obtain the list of required
shared library files:</p>

<p>dumpbin (Windows) objdump (MinGW on Windows) ldd
(Linux/Unix) otool (Mac OSX)</p>

<p>The following functions are provided by this module:</p>

<p>get_prerequisites list_prerequisites
list_prerequisites_by_glob gp_append_unique
is_file_executable gp_item_default_embedded_path (projects
can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
gp_resolve_item (projects can override with
gp_resolve_item_override) gp_resolved_file_type (projects
can override with gp_resolved_file_type_override)
gp_file_type</p>

<p>Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function,
break, return and PARENT_SCOPE.</p>

<p>GET_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt;
&lt;prerequisites_var&gt; &lt;exclude_system&gt;
&lt;recurse&gt; &lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt;)</p>

<p>Get the list of shared library files required by
&lt;target&gt;. The list in the variable named
&lt;prerequisites_var&gt; should be empty on first entry to
this function. On exit, &lt;prerequisites_var&gt; will
contain the list of required shared library files.</p>

<p>&lt;target&gt; is the full path to an executable file.
&lt;prerequi- sites_var&gt; is the name of a CMake variable
to contain the results. &lt;exclude_system&gt; must be 0 or
1 indicating whether to include or exclude
&quot;system&quot; prerequisites. If &lt;recurse&gt; is set
to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to
0 only direct prerequisites are listed. &lt;exepath&gt; is
the path to the top level executable used for
@executable_path replacment on the Mac. &lt;dirs&gt; is a
list of paths where libraries might be found: these paths
are searched first when a target without any path info is
given. Then standard system locations are also searched:
PATH, Framework locations, /usr/lib...</p>

<p>LIST_PREREQUISITES(&lt;target&gt; [&lt;recurse&gt;
[&lt;exclude_system&gt; [&lt;verbose&gt;]]])</p>

<p>Print a message listing the prerequisites of
&lt;target&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;target&gt; is the name of a shared library or
executable target or the full path to a shared library or
executable file. If &lt;recurse&gt; is set to 1 all
prerequisites will be found recur- sively, if set to 0 only
direct prerequisites are listed. &lt;exclude_system&gt; must
be 0 or 1 indicating whether to include or exclude
&quot;system&quot; prerequisites. With &lt;verbose&gt; set
to 0 only the full path names of the prerequisites are
printed, set to 1 extra informatin will be displayed.</p>

<p>LIST_PREREQUISITES_BY_GLOB(&lt;glob_arg&gt;
&lt;glob_exp&gt;)</p>

<p>Print the prerequisites of shared library and executable
files matching a globbing pattern. &lt;glob_arg&gt; is GLOB
or GLOB_RECURSE and &lt;glob_exp&gt; is a globbing
expression used with &quot;file(GLOB&quot; or
&quot;file(GLOB_RECURSE&quot; to retrieve a list of matching
files. If a matching file is executable, its prerequisites
are listed.</p>

<p>Any additional (optional) arguments provided are passed
along as the optional arguments to the list_prerequisites
calls.</p>

<p>GP_APPEND_UNIQUE(&lt;list_var&gt; &lt;value&gt;)</p>

<p>Append &lt;value&gt; to the list variable
&lt;list_var&gt; only if the value is not already in the
list.</p>

<p>IS_FILE_EXECUTABLE(&lt;file&gt; &lt;result_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return 1 in &lt;result_var&gt; if &lt;file&gt; is a
binary executable, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>GP_ITEM_DEFAULT_EMBEDDED_PATH(&lt;item&gt;
&lt;default_embedded_path_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return the path that others should refer to the item by
when the item is embedded inside a bundle.</p>

<p>Override on a per-project basis by providing a
project-specific gp_item_default_embedded_path_override
function.</p>

<p>GP_RESOLVE_ITEM(&lt;context&gt; &lt;item&gt;
&lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;resolved_item_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Resolve an item into an existing full path file.</p>

<p>Override on a per-project basis by providing a
project-specific gp_resolve_item_override function.</p>

<p>GP_RESOLVED_FILE_TYPE(&lt;original_file&gt; &lt;file&gt;
&lt;exepath&gt; &lt;dirs&gt; &lt;type_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return the type of &lt;file&gt; with respect to
&lt;original_file&gt;. String describing type of
prerequisite is returned in variable named
&lt;type_var&gt;.</p>

<p>Use &lt;exepath&gt; and &lt;dirs&gt; if necessary to
resolve non-absolute &lt;file&gt; values -- but only for
non-embedded items.</p>

<p>Possible types are:</p>

<p>system local embedded other</p>

<p>Override on a per-project basis by providing a
project-specific gp_resolved_file_type_override
function.</p>

<p>GP_FILE_TYPE(&lt;original_file&gt; &lt;file&gt;
&lt;type_var&gt;)</p>

<p>Return the type of &lt;file&gt; with respect to
&lt;original_file&gt;. String describing type of
prerequisite is returned in variable named
&lt;type_var&gt;.</p>

<p>Possible types are:</p>

<p>system local embedded other</p>

<p>InstallRequiredSystemLibraries</p>

<p>By including this file, all library files listed in the
variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS will be installed
with install(PROGRAMS ...) into bin for WIN32 and lib for
non-WIN32. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP is set
to TRUE before including this file, then the INSTALL command
is not called. The user can use the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install
command and install them however they want. If it is the
MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be
found and automatically added to the
CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS, and installed. If
CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC com-
piler, then the debug libraries are installed when
available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY is set then
only the debug libraries are installed when both debug and
release are available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set
then the MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the
CRT run time libraries. If
CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION is set then the
libraries are installed to that directory rather than the
default. If CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS is
NOT set, then this file warns about required files that do
not exist. You can set this variable to ON before including
this file to avoid the warning. For example, the Visual
Studio Express editions do not include the redistributable
files, so if you include this file on a machine with only VS
Express installed, youll get the warning.</p>

<p>MacroAddFileDependencies
MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(&lt;_file&gt;
depend_files...)</p>

<p>Using the macro MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES() is
discouraged. There are usually better ways to specify the
correct dependen- cies.</p>

<p>MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(&lt;_file&gt;
depend_files...) is just a convenience wrapper around the
OBJECT_DEPENDS source file prop- erty. You can just use
set_property(SOURCE &lt;file&gt; APPEND PROP- ERTY
OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.</p>

<p>ProcessorCount ProcessorCount(var)</p>

<p>Determine the number of processors/cores and save value
in ${var}</p>

<p>Sets the variable named ${var} to the number of physical
cores available on the machine if the information can be
determined. Otherwise it is set to 0. Currently this
functionality is imple- mented for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD,
HPUX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, QNX, Sun and Windows.</p>

<p>This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer
(&gt;=1) if it succeeds. It returns 0 if theres a problem
determining the processor count.</p>

<p>Example use, in a ctest -S dashboard script:</p>

<p>include(ProcessorCount) ProcessorCount(N) if(NOT N EQUAL
0) set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j${N}) set(ctest_test_args
${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N}) endif()</p>

<p>This function is intended to offer an approximation of
the value of the number of compute cores available on the
current machine, such that you may use that value for
parallel building and par- allel testing. It is meant to
help utilize as much of the machine as seems reasonable. Of
course, knowledge of what else might be running on the
machine simultaneously should be used when deciding whether
to request a machines full capacity all for yourself.</p>

<p>Qt4ConfigDependentSettings</p>

<p>This file is included by FindQt4.cmake, dont include it
directly.</p>

<p>Qt4Macros</p>

<p>This file is included by FindQt4.cmake, don t include it
directly.</p>

<p>SelectLibraryConfigurations</p>

<p>select_library_configurations( basename )</p>

<p>This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and
will choose good values for basename_LIBRARY,
basename_LIBRARIES, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and
basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what has been found
and set. If only base- name_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined,
basename_LIBRARY will be set to the release value, and
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG will be set to
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND. If only
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY
will take the debug value, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will
be set to base- name_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND.</p>

<p>If the generator supports configuration types, then
base- name_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will be set with
debug and optimized flags specifying the library to be used
for the given configuration. If no build type has been set
or the generator in use does not support configuration
types, then base- name_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will
take only the release value, or the debug value if the
release one is not set.</p>

<p>SquishTestScript</p>

<p>This script launches a GUI test using Squish. You should
not call the script directly; instead, you should access it
via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST macro that is defined in
FindSquish.cmake.</p>

<p>This script starts the Squish server, launches the test
on the client, and finally stops the squish server. If any
of these steps fail (including if the tests do not pass)
then a fatal error is raised.</p>

<p>TestBigEndian Define macro to determine endian type</p>

<p>Check if the system is big endian or little endian</p>

<p>TEST_BIG_ENDIAN(VARIABLE) VARIABLE - variable to store
the result to</p>

<p>TestCXXAcceptsFlag Test CXX compiler for a flag</p>

<p>Check if the CXX compiler accepts a flag</p>

<p>Macro CHECK_CXX_ACCEPTS_FLAG(FLAGS VARIABLE) - checks if
the function exists FLAGS - the flags to try VARIABLE -
variable to store the result</p>

<p>TestForANSIForScope Check for ANSI for scope support</p>

<p>Check if the compiler restricts the scope of variables
declared in a for-init-statement to the loop body.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_ANSI_FOR_SCOPE - holds result</p>

<p>TestForANSIStreamHeaders Test for compiler support of
ANSI stream headers iostream, etc.</p>

<p>check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI
iostream header (without the .h)</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STREAM_HEADERS - defined by the
results</p>

<p>TestForSSTREAM Test for compiler support of ANSI sstream
header</p>

<p>check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI sstream
header</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - defined by the results</p>

<p>TestForSTDNamespace Test for std:: namespace support</p>

<p>check if the compiler supports std:: on stl classes</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_STD_NAMESPACE - defined by the results</p>

<p>UseEcos This module defines variables and macros
required to build eCos application.</p>

<p>This file contains the following macros:
ECOS_ADD_INCLUDE_DIREC- TORIES() - add the eCos include dirs
ECOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name source1 ... sourceN ) - create an
eCos executable ECOS_ADJUST_DIRECTORY(VAR source1 ...
sourceN ) - adjusts the path of the source files and puts
the result into VAR</p>

<p>Macros for selecting the toolchain:
ECOS_USE_ARM_ELF_TOOLS() - enable the ARM ELF toolchain for
the directory where it is called ECOS_USE_I386_ELF_TOOLS() -
enable the i386 ELF toolchain for the directory where it is
called ECOS_USE_PPC_EABI_TOOLS() - enable the PowerPC
toolchain for the directory where it is called</p>

<p>It contains the following variables: ECOS_DEFINITIONS
ECOSCON- FIG_EXECUTABLE ECOS_CONFIG_FILE - defaults to
ecos.ecc, if your eCos configuration file has a different
name, adjust this variable for internal use only:</p>

<p>ECOS_ADD_TARGET_LIB</p>

<p>UseJava Use Module for Java</p>

<p>This file provides functions for Java. It is assumed
that Find- Java.cmake has already been loaded. See
FindJava.cmake for information on how to load Java into your
CMake project.</p>

<p>add_jar(target_name</p>

<p>[SOURCES] source1 [source2 ...] [resource1 ...]
[INCLUDE_JARS jar1 [jar2 ...]] [ENTRY_POINT entry] [VERSION
version] [OUTPUT_NAME name] [OUTPUT_DIR dir] )</p>

<p>This command creates a &lt;target_name&gt;.jar. It
compiles the given source files (source) and adds the given
resource files (resource) to the jar file. If only resource
files are given then just a jar file is created. The list of
include jars are added to the classpath when compiling the
java sources and also to the dependencies of the target.
INCLUDE_JARS also accepts other target names created by
add_jar. For backwards compatibil- ity, jar files listed as
sources are ignored (as they have been since the first
version of this module).</p>

<p>The default OUTPUT_DIR can also be changed by setting
the vari- able CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_DIR.</p>

<p>Additional instructions:</p>

<p>To add compile flags to the target you can set these
flags with the following variable:</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAVA_COMPILE_FLAGS -nowarn)</p>

<p>To add a path or a jar file to the class path you can do
this with the CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH variable.</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH
/usr/share/java/shibboleet.jar)</p>

<p>To use a different output name for the target you can
set it with:</p>

<p>add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_NAME
shibboleet.jar)</p>

<p>To use a different output directory than
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR you can set it with:</p>

<p>add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_DIR
${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)</p>

<p>To define an entry point in your jar you can set it with
the ENTRY_POINT named argument:</p>

<p>add_jar(example ENTRY_POINT
com/examples/MyProject/Main)</p>

<p>To add a VERSION to the target output name you can set
it using the VERSION named argument to add_jar. This will
create a jar file with the name shibboleet-1.0.0.jar and
will create a symlink shibboleet.jar pointing to the jar
with the version information.</p>

<p>add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)</p>

<p>If the target is a JNI library, utilize the following
commands to create a JNI symbolic link:</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JNI_TARGET TRUE) add_jar(shibboleet
shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0) install_jar(shibboleet
${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/shibboleet)
install_jni_symlink(shibboleet ${JAVA_LIB_INSTALL_DIR})</p>

<p>If a single target needs to produce more than one jar
from its java source code, to prevent the accumulation of
duplicate class files in subsequent jars, set/reset
CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX prior to calling the add_jar()
function:</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/foo) add_jar(foo
foo.java)</p>

<p>set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/bar) add_jar(bar
bar.java)</p>

<p>Target Properties:</p>

<p>The add_jar() functions sets some target properties. You
can get these properties with the get_property(TARGET
&lt;target_name&gt; PROPERTY &lt;propery_name&gt;)
command.</p>

<p>INSTALL_FILES The files which should be installed. This
is used by install_jar(). JNI_SYMLINK The JNI symlink which
should be installed. This is used by install_jni_symlink().
JAR_FILE The location of the jar file so that you can
include it. CLASS_DIR The directory where the class files
can be found. For example to use them with javah.</p>

<p>find_jar(&lt;VAR&gt;</p>

<p>name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [VERSIONS version1 [version2]] [DOC &quot;cache
documentation string&quot;] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to the named
jar. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to stor
the result of this command. If the full path to a jar is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing
is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the
search will be attempted again next time find_jar is invoked
with the same variable. The name of the full path to a file
that is searched for is specified by the names listed after
NAMES argument. Additional search locations can be specified
after the PATHS argument. If you require special a version
of a jar file you can specify it with the VERSIONS argu-
ment. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache.</p>

<p>install_jar(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)</p>

<p>This command installs the TARGET_NAME files to the given
DESTI- NATION. It should be called in the same scope as
add_jar() or it will fail.</p>

<p>install_jni_symlink(TARGET_NAME DESTINATION)</p>

<p>This command installs the TARGET_NAME JNI symlinks to
the given DESTINATION. It should be called in the same scope
as add_jar() or it will fail.</p>

<p>create_javadoc(&lt;VAR&gt;</p>

<p>PACKAGES pkg1 [pkg2 ...] [SOURCEPATH &lt;sourcepath&gt;]
[CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;] [INSTALLPATH &lt;install
path&gt;] [DOCTITLE &quot;the documentation title&quot;]
[WINDOWTITLE &quot;the title of the document&quot;] [AUTHOR
TRUE|FALSE] [USE TRUE|FALSE] [VERSION TRUE|FALSE] )</p>

<p>Create java documentation based on files or packages.
For more details please read the javadoc manpage.</p>

<p>There are two main signatures for create_javadoc. The
first sig- nature works with package names on a path with
source files:</p>

<p>Example: create_javadoc(my_example_doc PACKAGES
com.exmaple.foo com.example.bar SOURCEPATH
&quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}&quot; CLASSPATH
${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH} WINDOWTITLE &quot;My
example&quot; DOCTITLE &quot;&lt;h1&gt;My
example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot; AUTHOR TRUE USE TRUE VERSION TRUE
)</p>

<p>The second signature for create_javadoc works on a given
list of files.</p>

<p>create_javadoc(&lt;VAR&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...]
[CLASSPATH &lt;classpath&gt;] [INSTALLPATH &lt;install
path&gt;] [DOCTITLE &quot;the documentation title&quot;]
[WINDOWTITLE &quot;the title of the document&quot;] [AUTHOR
TRUE|FALSE] [USE TRUE|FALSE] [VERSION TRUE|FALSE] )</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>create_javadoc(my_example_doc FILES ${example_SRCS}
CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH} WINDOWTITLE &quot;My
example&quot; DOCTITLE &quot;&lt;h1&gt;My
example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot; AUTHOR TRUE USE TRUE VERSION TRUE
)</p>

<p>Both signatures share most of the options. These options
are the same as what you can find in the javadoc manpage.
Please look at the manpage for CLASSPATH, DOCTITLE,
WINDOWTITLE, AUTHOR, USE and VERSION.</p>

<p>The documentation will be by default installed to</p>

<p>${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/javadoc/&lt;VAR&gt;</p>

<p>if you dont set the INSTALLPATH.</p>

<p>UseJavaClassFilelist</p>

<p>This script create a list of compiled Java class files
to be added to a jar file. This avoids including cmake files
which get created in the binary directory.</p>

<p>UseJavaSymlinks</p>

<p>Helper script for UseJava.cmake</p>

<p>UsePkgConfig Obsolete pkg-config module for CMake, use
FindPkgConfig instead.</p>

<p>This module defines the following macro:</p>

<p>PKGCONFIG(package includedir libdir linkflags
cflags)</p>

<p>Calling PKGCONFIG will fill the desired information into
the 4 given arguments, e.g. PKGCONFIG(libart-2.0
LIBART_INCLUDE_DIR LIBART_LINK_DIR LIBART_LINK_FLAGS
LIBART_CFLAGS) if pkg-config was NOT found or the specified
software package doesnt exist, the variable will be empty
when the function returns, otherwise they will contain the
respective information</p>

<p>UseQt4 Use Module for QT4</p>

<p>Sets up C and C++ to use Qt 4. It is assumed that
FindQt.cmake has already been loaded. See FindQt.cmake for
information on how to load Qt 4 into your CMake project.</p>

<p>UseSWIG SWIG module for CMake</p>

<p>Defines the following macros:</p>

<p>SWIG_ADD_MODULE(name language [ files ]) - Define swig
module with given name and specified language
SWIG_LINK_LIBRARIES(name [ libraries ]) - Link libraries to
swig module</p>

<p>All other macros are for internal use only. To get the
actual name of the swig module, use:
${SWIG_MODULE_${name}_REAL_NAME}. Set Source files
properties such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to specify
special behavior of SWIG. Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can
be used to add special flags to all swig calls. Another spe-
cial variable is CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR, it allows one to specify
where to write all the swig generated module (swig -outdir
option) The name-specific variable
SWIG_MODULE_&lt;name&gt;_EXTRA_DEPS may be used to specify
extra dependencies for the generated mod- ules. If the
source file generated by swig need some special flag you can
use set_source_files_properties( ${swig_gener-
ated_file_fullname}</p>

<p>Use_wxWindows
---------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>This convenience include finds if wxWindows is installed
and set the appropriate libs, incdirs, flags etc. author Jan
Woetzel &lt;jw -at- mip.informatik.uni-kiel.de&gt; (07/2003)
USAGE:</p>

<p>just include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your projects
CMakeLists.txt</p>

<p>include( ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}/Use_wxWindows.cmake)</p>

<p>if you are sure you need GL then</p>

<p>set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)</p>

<p>*before* you include this file.</p>

<p>UsewxWidgets Convenience include for using wxWidgets
library.</p>

<p>Determines if wxWidgets was FOUND and sets the
appropriate libs, incdirs, flags, etc. INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
and LINK_DIRECTORIES are called.</p>

<p>USAGE</p>

<p># Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is
important! find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE}) # and for each of your
dependent executable/library targets:
target_link_libraries(&lt;YourTarget&gt;
${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})</p>

<p>DEPRECATED</p>

<p>LINK_LIBRARIES is not called in favor of adding
dependencies per target.</p>
