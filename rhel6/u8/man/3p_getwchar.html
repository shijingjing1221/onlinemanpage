<p>GETWCHAR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETWCHAR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getwchar - get a wide character from a stdin
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t getwchar(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getwchar() function shall be equivalent
to getwc(stdin).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to fgetwc().</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fgetwc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the wint_t value returned by
getwchar() is stored into a variable of type wchar_t and
then compared against the wint_t macro WEOF, the result may
be incorrect. Only the wint_t type is guaranteed to be able
to represent any wide character and WEOF.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
