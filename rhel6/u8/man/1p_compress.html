<p>COMPRESS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual COMPRESS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME compress - compress data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS compress [-fv][-b bits][file ...]</p>

<p>compress [-cfv][-b bits][file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The compress utility shall attempt to reduce
the size of the named files by using adaptive Lempel-Ziv
coding algorithm.</p>

<p>Note: Lempel-Ziv is US Patent 4464650, issued to William
Eastman, Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, Martin Cohn on August
7th, 1984, and assigned to Sperry Corporation.</p>

<p>Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression is covered by US Patent
4558302, issued to Terry A. Welch on December 10th, 1985,
and assigned to Sperry Corpora- tion.</p>

<p>On systems not supporting adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding
algorithm, the input files shall not be changed and an error
value greater than two shall be returned. Except when the
output is to the standard output, each file shall be
replaced by one with the extension .Z. If the invok- ing
process has appropriate privileges, the ownership, modes,
access time, and modification time of the original file are
preserved. If appending the .Z to the filename would make
the name exceed {NAME_MAX} bytes, the command shall fail. If
no files are specified, the standard input shall be
compressed to the standard output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The compress utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-b bits Specify the maximum number of bits to use in a
code. For a con- forming application, the bits argument
shall be:</p>

<p>9 &lt;= bits &lt;= 14</p>

<p>The implementation may allow bits values of greater than
14. The default is 14, 15, or 16.</p>

<p>-c Cause compress to write to the standard output; the
input file is not changed, and no .Z files are created.</p>

<p>-f Force compression of file, even if it does not
actually reduce the size of the file, or if the
corresponding file .Z file already exists. If the -f option
is not given, and the process is not running in the
background, the user is prompted as to whether an existing
file .Z file should be overwritten.</p>

<p>-v Write the percentage reduction of each file to
standard error.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be compressed.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is-.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES If file operands are specified, the input
files contain the data to be compressed.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of com- press:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If no file operands are specified, or if a file
operand is, or if the -c option is specified, the standard
output contains the compressed output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic and prompt mes- sages and the output from -v.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output files shall contain the
compressed output. The format of compressed files is
unspecified and interchange of such files between
implementations (including access via unspecified file
sharing mecha- nisms) is not required by IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>2 One or more files were not compressed because they
would have increased in size (and the -f option was not
specified).</p>

<p>&gt;2 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS The input file shall remain
unmodified.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The amount of compression obtained
depends on the size of the input, the number of bits per
code, and the distribution of common substrings. Typically,
text such as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%.
Compression is generally much better than that achieved by
Huffman cod- ing or adaptive Huffman coding ( compact), and
takes less time to com- pute.</p>

<p>Although compress strictly follows the default actions
upon receipt of a signal or when an error occurs, some
unexpected results may occur. In some implementations it is
likely that a partially compressed file is left in place,
alongside its uncompressed input file. Since the general
operation of compress is to delete the uncompressed file
only after the .Z file has been successfully filled, an
application should always carefully check the exit status of
compress before arbitrarily deleting files that have
like-named neighbors with .Z suffixes.</p>

<p>The limit of 14 on the bits option-argument is to
achieve portability to all systems (within the restrictions
imposed by the lack of an explicit published file format).
Some implementations based on 16-bit architectures cannot
support 15 or 16-bit uncompression.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
