<p>IPSEC_EROUTE(5) Executable programs IPSEC_EROUTE(5)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_eroute - list of existing eroutes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec eroute cat/proc/net/ipsec_eroute</p>

<p>OBSOLETE Note that eroute is only supported on the
classic KLIPS stack. It is not supported on any other stack
and will be completely removed in future versions. On the
mast stack, use ipsec policy, on the netkey stack, use ip
xfrm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /proc/net/ipsec_eroute lists the IPSEC
extended routing tables, which control what (if any)
processing is applied to non-encrypted packets arriving for
IPSEC processing and forwarding. At this point it is a
read-only file.</p>

<p>A table entry consists of:</p>

<p>+ packet count,</p>

<p>+ source address with mask and source port (0 if all
ports or not applicable)</p>

<p>+ a &acute;-&gt;&acute; separator for visual and
automated parsing between src and dst</p>

<p>+ destination address with mask and destination port (0
if all ports or not applicable)</p>

<p>+ a &acute;=&gt;&acute; separator for visual and
automated parsing between selection criteria and SAID to
use</p>

<p>+ SAID (Security Association IDentifier), comprised
of:</p>

<p>+ protocol (proto),</p>

<p>+ address family (af), where &acute;.&acute; stands for
IPv4 and &acute;:&acute; for IPv6</p>

<p>+ Security Parameters Index (SPI),</p>

<p>+ effective destination (edst), where the packet should
be forwarded after processing (normally the other security
gateway) together indicate which Security Association should
be used to process the packet,</p>

<p>+ a &acute;:&acute; separating the SAID from the
transport protocol (0 if all protocols)</p>

<p>+ source identity text string with no whitespace, in
parens,</p>

<p>+ destination identity text string with no whitespace,
in parens</p>

<p>Addresses are written as IPv4 dotted quads or IPv6
coloned hex, protocol is one of &quot;ah&quot;,
&quot;esp&quot;, &quot;comp&quot; or &quot;tun&quot; and
SPIs are prefixed hexadecimal numbers where the prefix
&acute;.&acute; is for IPv4 and the prefix &acute;:&acute;
is for IPv6</p>

<p>SAIDs are written as &quot;protoafSPI@edst&quot;. There
are also 5 &quot;magic&quot; SAIDs which have special
meaning:</p>

<p>+ %drop means that matches are to be dropped</p>

<p>+ %reject means that matches are to be dropped and an
ICMP returned, if possible to inform</p>

<p>+ %trap means that matches are to trigger an ACQUIRE
message to the Key Management daemon(s) and a hold eroute
will be put in place to prevent subsequent packets also
triggering ACQUIRE messages.</p>

<p>+ %hold means that matches are to stored until the
eroute is replaced or until that eroute gets reaped</p>

<p>+ %pass means that matches are to allowed to pass
without IPSEC processing</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1867 172.31.252.0/24:0 -&gt; 0.0.0.0/0:0 =&gt;
tun0x130@192.168.43.1:0</p>

<p>() ()</p>

<p>means that 1,867 packets have been sent to an eroute
that has been set up to protect traffic between the subnet
172.31.252.0 with a subnet mask of 24 bits and the default
address/mask represented by an address of 0.0.0.0 with a
subnet mask of 0 bits using the local machine as a security
gateway on this end of the tunnel and the machine
192.168.43.1 on the other end of the tunnel with a Security
Association IDentifier of tun0x130@192.168.43.1 which means
that it is a tunnel mode connection (4, IPPROTO_IPIP) with a
Security Parameters Index of 130 in hexadecimal with no
identies defined for either end.</p>

<p>746 192.168.2.110/32:0 -&gt; 192.168.2.120/32:25 =&gt;
esp0x130@192.168.2.120:6</p>

<p>() ()</p>

<p>means that 746 packets have been sent to an eroute that
has been set up to protect traffic sent from any port on the
host 192.168.2.110 to the SMTP (TCP, port 25) port on the
host 192.168.2.120 with a Security Association IDentifier of
tun0x130@192.168.2.120 which means that it is a transport
mode connection with a Security Parameters Index of 130 in
hexadecimal with no identies defined for either end.</p>

<p>125 3049:1::/64 -&gt; 0:0/0 =&gt; tun:130@3058:4::5 ()
()</p>

<p>means that 125 packets have been sent to an eroute that
has been set up to protect traffic between the subnet
3049:1:: with a subnet mask of 64 bits and the default
address/mask represented by an address of 0:0 with a subnet
mask of 0 bits using the local machine as a security gateway
on this end of the tunnel and the machine 3058:4::5 on the
other end of the tunnel with a Security Association
IDentifier of tun:130@3058:4::5 which means that it is a
tunnel mode connection with a Security Parameters Index of
130 in hexadecimal with no identies defined for either
end.</p>

<p>42 192.168.6.0/24:0 -&gt; 192.168.7.0/24:0 =&gt;
%passthrough</p>

<p>means that 42 packets have been sent to an eroute that
has been set up to pass the traffic from the subnet
192.168.6.0 with a subnet mask of 24 bits and to subnet
192.168.7.0 with a subnet mask of 24 bits without any IPSEC
processing with no identies defined for either end.</p>

<p>2112 192.168.8.55/32:0 -&gt; 192.168.9.47/24:0 =&gt;
%hold (east) ()</p>

<p>means that 2112 packets have been sent to an eroute that
has been set up to hold the traffic from the host
192.168.8.55 and to host 192.168.9.47 until a key exchange
from a Key Management daemon succeeds and puts in an SA or
fails and puts in a pass or drop eroute depending on the
default configuration with the local client defined as
&quot;east&quot; and no identy defined for the remote
end.</p>

<p>2001 192.168.2.110/32:0 -&gt; 192.168.2.120/32:0
=&gt;</p>

<p>esp0xe6de@192.168.2.120:0 () ()</p>

<p>means that 2001 packets have been sent to an eroute that
has been set up to protect traffic between the host
192.168.2.110 and the host 192.168.2.120 using 192.168.2.110
as a security gateway on this end of the connection and the
machine 192.168.2.120 on the other end of the connection
with a Security Association IDentifier of
esp0xe6de@192.168.2.120 which means that it is a transport
mode connection with a Security Parameters Index of e6de in
hexadecimal using Encapsuation Security Payload protocol
(50, IPPROTO_ESP) with no identies defined for either
end.</p>

<p>1984 3049:1::110/128 -&gt; 3049:1::120/128 =&gt;</p>

<p>ah:f5ed@3049:1::120 () ()</p>

<p>means that 1984 packets have been sent to an eroute that
has been set up to authenticate traffic between the host
3049:1::110 and the host 3049:1::120 using 3049:1::110 as a
security gateway on this end of the connection and the
machine 3049:1::120 on the other end of the connection with
a Security Association IDentifier of ah:f5ed@3049:1::120
which means that it is a transport mode connection with a
Security Parameters Index of f5ed in hexadecimal using
