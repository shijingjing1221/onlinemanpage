<p>NAME libtalloc_tutorial - The Tutorial</p>

<p>Introduction Talloc is a hierarchical, reference counted
memory pool system with destructors. It is built atop the C
standard library and it defines a set of utility functions
that altogether simplifies allocation and deallocation of
data, especially for complex structures that contain many
dynamically allocated elements such as strings and
arrays.</p>

<p>The main goals of this library are: removing the needs
for creating a cleanup function for every complex structure,
providing a logical organization of allocated memory blocks
and reducing the likelihood of creating memory leaks in
long-running applications. All of this is achieved by
allocating memory in a hierarchical structure of talloc
contexts such that deallocating one context recursively
frees all of its descendants as well.</p>

<p>Main features &middot; An open source project</p>

<p>&middot; A hierarchical memory model</p>

<p>&middot; Natural projection of data structures into the
memory space</p>

<p>&middot; Simplifies memory management of large data
structures</p>

<p>&middot; Automatic execution of a destructor before the
memory is freed</p>

<p>&middot; Simulates a dynamic type system</p>

<p>&middot; Implements a transparent memory pool</p>
