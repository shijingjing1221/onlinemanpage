<p>PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_GETPSHAPOSIXPProgrammer
PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_GETPSHARED(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_barrierattr_getpshared,
pthread_barrierattr_setpshared - get and set the
process-shared attribute of the barrier attributes object
(ADVANCED REALTIME THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_barrierattr_getpshared(const
pthread_barrierattr_t * restrict attr, int *restrict
pshared); int
pthread_barrierattr_setpshared(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr,
int pshared);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_barrierattr_getpshared()
function shall obtain the value of the process-shared
attribute from the attributes object referenced by attr. The
pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function shall set the pro-
cess-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object
referenced by attr.</p>

<p>The process-shared attribute is set to
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a barrier to be operated
upon by any thread that has access to the mem- ory where the
barrier is allocated. If the process-shared attribute is
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the barrier shall only be operated
upon by threads created within the same process as the
thread that initialized the barrier; if threads of different
processes attempt to operate on such a barrier, the behavior
is undefined. The default value of the attribute shall be
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE. Both constants PTHREAD_PRO-
CESS_SHARED and PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE are defined in
&lt;pthread.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Additional attributes, their default values, and the
names of the asso- ciated functions to get and set those
attribute values are implementa- tion-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the
pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() function shall return zero
and store the value of the process-shared attribute of attr
into the object referenced by the pshared parameter.
Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>If successful, the pthread_barrierattr_setpshared()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The new value specified for the process-shared
attribute is not one of the legal values
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED or PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pthread_barrierattr_getpshared()
and pthread_barrierattr_setp- shared() functions are part of
the Barriers option and need not be pro- vided on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
