<p>INVOCATION_NAME(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
INVOCATION_NAME(3)</p>

<p>NAME program_invocation_name,
program_invocation_short_name - obtain name used to invoke
calling program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;errno.h&gt;</p>

<p>extern char *program_invocation_name; extern char
*program_invocation_short_name;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION program_invocation_name contains the name
that was used to invoke the calling program. This is the
same as the value of argv[0] in main(), with the difference
that the scope of program_invocation_name is global.</p>

<p>program_invocation_short_name contains the basename
component of name that was used to invoke the calling
program. That is, it is the same value as
program_invocation_name, with all text up to and including
the final slash (/), if any, removed.</p>

<p>These variables are automatically initialized by the
glibc run-time startup code.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These variables are GNU extensions, and
should not be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES The Linux-specific /proc/[number]/cmdline file
provides access to simi- lar information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO proc(5), feature_test_macros(7)</p>
