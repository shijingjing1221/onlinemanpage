<p>NAME ccomps - connected components filter for graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ccomps [ -sxvnzC? ] [ -X[#]v ] [ -ooutfile ] [
files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ccomps decomposes graphs into their
connected components, printing the components to standard
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-s No output graph is printed. The return value can be
used to check if the graph is connected or not.</p>

<p>-x Only the connected components are printed, as
separate graphs.</p>

<p>-v Counts of nodes, edges and connected components are
printed.</p>

<p>-z Sort components by size, with the largest first. This
is only effective if either -x or -X#v is present. Thus,
-zX#0 will cause the largest component to be printed.</p>

<p>-C Use clusters in computing components in addition to
normal edge connectivity. In essence, this gives the
connected components of the derived graph in which nodes
top-level clusters and nodes in the original graph. This
maintains all subgraph structure within a component, even if
a subgraph does not contain any nodes.</p>

<p>-n Do not project subgraph structure. Normally, if
ccomps produces components as graphs distinct from the input
graph, it will define subgraphs which are projections of
subgraphs of the input graph onto the component. (If the
projection is empty, no sub- graph is produced.) If this
flag is set, the component contains only the relevant nodes
and edges.</p>

<p>-X node_name Prints only the component containing the
node node_name, if any.</p>

<p>-X# index Prints only component number index, if any,
starting at 0.</p>

<p>-o outfile If specified, each graph will be written to a
different file with the names derived from outfile. In
particular, if both -o and -x flags are used, then each
connected component is written to a different file. If
outfile does not have a suffix, the first file will have the
name outfile; then next outfile_1, then next outfile_2, and
so on. If outfile has a suffix, i.e., has the form base.sfx,
then the files will be named base.sfx, base_1.sfx,
base_2.sfx, etc.</p>

<p>By default, each input graph is printed, with each
connected component given as a subgraph whose name is a
concatenation of the name of the input graph, the string
&quot;_component_&quot; and the number of the component.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot
format. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES Unless used to extract a single connected
component, ccomps returns 0 if all the input graphs are
connected; and non-zero if any graph has multiple
components, or any error occurred. If just extracting a sin-
gle component, ccomps returns 0 on success and non-zero if
an error occurred.</p>

<p>BUGS It is possible, though unlikely, that the names
used for connected com- ponents and their subgraphs may
conflict with existing subgraph names.</p>
