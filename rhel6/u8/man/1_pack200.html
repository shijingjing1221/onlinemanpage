<p>pack200(1) Java Deployment Tools pack200(1)</p>

<p>NAME pack200 - Packages a JAR file into a compressed
pack200 file for web deployment.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pack200 [options] output-file JAR-file</p>

<p>Options can be in any order. The last option on the
command line or in a properties file supersedes all
previously specified options.</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>output-file Name of the output file.</p>

<p>JAR-file Name of the input file.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pack200 command is a Java application
that transforms a JAR file into a compressed pack200 file
with the Java gzip compressor. The pack200 files are highly
compressed files that can be directly deployed to save
bandwidth and reduce download time.</p>

<p>The pack200 command has several options to fine-tune and
set the compression engine. The typical usage is shown in
the following example, where myarchive.pack.gz is produced
with the default pack200 command settings:</p>

<p>pack200 myarchive.pack.gz myarchive.jar</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r, --repack Produces a JAR file by packing and
unpacking a JAR file. The resulting file can be used as an
input to the jarsigner(1) tool. The following example packs
and unpacks the myarchive.jar file:</p>

<p>pack200 --repack myarchive-packer.jar myarchive.jar
pack200 --repack myarchive.jar</p>

<p>The following example preserves the order of files in
the input file.</p>

<p>-g, --no-gzip Produces a pack200 file. With this option,
a suitable compressor must be used, and the target system
must use a corresponding decompresser.</p>

<p>pack200 --no-gzip myarchive.pack myarchive.jar</p>

<p>-G, --strip-debug Strips debugging attributes from the
output. These include SourceFile, LineNumberTable,
LocalVariableTable and LocalVariableTypeTable. Removing
these attributes reduces the size of both downloads and
installations, but reduces the usefulness of debuggers.</p>

<p>--keep-file-order Preserve the order of files in the
input file. This is the default behavior.</p>

<p>-O, --no-keep-file-order The packer reorders and
transmits all elements. The packer can also remove JAR
directory names to reduce the download size. However,
certain JAR file optimizations, such as indexing, might not
work correctly.</p>

<p>-Svalue , --segment-limit=value The value is the
estimated target size N (in bytes) of each archive segment.
If a single input file requires more than N bytes, then its
own archive segment is provided. As a special case, a value
of -1 produces a single large segment with all input files,
while a value of 0 produces one segment for each class.
Larger archive segments result in less fragmentation and
better compression, but processing them requires more
memory.</p>

<p>The size of each segment is estimated by counting the
size of each input file to be transmitted in the segment
with the size of its name and other transmitted
properties.</p>

<p>The default is -1, which means that the packer creates a
single segment output file. In cases where extremely large
output files are generated, users are strongly encouraged to
use segmenting or break up the input file into smaller
JARs.</p>

<p>A 10 MB JAR packed without this limit typically packs
about 10 percent smaller, but the packer might require a
larger Java heap (about 10 times the segment limit).</p>

<p>-Evalue , --effort=value If the value is set to a single
decimal digit, then the packer uses the indicated amount of
effort in compressing the archive. Level 1 might produce
somewhat larger size and faster compression speed, while
level 9 takes much longer, but can produce better
compression. The special value 0 instructs the pack200
command to copy through the original JAR file directly with
no compression. The JSR 200 standard requires any unpacker
to understand this special case as a pass-through of the
entire archive.</p>

<p>The default is 5, to invest a modest amount of time to
produce reasonable compression.</p>

<p>-Hvalue , --deflate-hint=value Overrides the default,
which preserves the input information, but can cause the
transmitted archive to be larger. The possible values are:
true, false, or keep.</p>

<p>If the value is true or false, then the packer200
command sets the deflation hint accordingly in the output
archive and does not transmit the individual deflation hints
of archive elements.</p>

<p>The keep value preserves deflation hints observed in the
input JAR. This is the default.</p>

<p>-mvalue , --modification-time=value The possible values
are latest and keep.</p>

<p>If the value is latest, then the packer attempts to
determine the latest modification time, among all the
available entries in the original archive, or the latest
modification time of all the available entries in that
segment. This single value is transmitted as part of the
segment and applied to all the entries in each segment. This
can marginally decrease the transmitted size of the archive
at the expense of setting all installed files to a single
date.</p>

<p>If the value is keep, then modification times observed
in the input JAR are preserved. This is the default.</p>

<p>-Pfile , --pass-file=file Indicates that a file should
be passed through bytewise with no compression. By repeating
the option, multiple files can be specified. There is no
pathname transformation, except that the system file
separator is replaced by the JAR file separator forward
slash (/). The resulting file names must match exactly as
strings with their occurrences in the JAR file. If file is a
directory name, then all files under that directory are
passed.</p>

<p>-Uaction , --unknown-attribute=action Overrides the
default behavior, which means that the class file that
contains the unknown attribute is passed through with the
specified action. The possible values for actions are error,
strip, or pass.</p>

<p>If the value is error, then the entire pack200 command
operation fails with a suitable explanation.</p>

<p>If the value is strip, then the attribute is dropped.
Removing the required Java Virtual Machine (JVM) attributes
can cause class loader failures.</p>

<p>If the value is pass, then the entire class is
transmitted as though it is a resource.</p>

<p>-Cattribute-name=layout ,
--class-attribute=attribute-name=action See next option.</p>

<p>-Fattribute-name=layout ,
--field-attribute=attribute-name=action See next option.</p>

<p>-Mattribute-name=layout ,
--method-attribute=attribute-name=action See next
option.</p>

<p>-Dattribute-name=layout ,
--code-attribute=attribute-name=action With the previous
four options, the attribute layout can be specified for a
class entity, such as class-attribute, field- attribute,
method-attribute, and code-attribute. The attribute- name is
the name of the attribute for which the layout or action is
being defined. The possible values for action are some-
layout-string, error, strip, pass.</p>

<p>some-layout-string: The layout language is defined in
the JSR 200 specification, for example: --class-
attribute=SourceFile=RUH.</p>

<p>If the value is error, then the pack200 operation fails
with an explanation.</p>

<p>If the value is strip, then the attribute is removed
from the output. Removing JVM-required attributes can cause
class loader failures. For example,
--class-attribute=CompilationID=pass causes the class file
that contains this attribute to be passed through without
further action by the packer.</p>

<p>If the value is pass, then the entire class is
transmitted as though it is a resource.</p>

<p>-f pack.properties , --config-file=pack.properties A
configuration file, containing Java properties to initialize
the packer, can be specified on the command line.</p>

<p>pack200 -f pack.properties myarchive.pack.gz
myarchive.jar more pack.properties # Generic properties for
the packer. modification.time=latest deflate.hint=false
keep.file.order=false # This option will cause the files
bearing new attributes to # be reported as an error rather
than passed uncompressed. unknown.attribute=error # Change
the segment limit to be unlimited. segment.limit=-1</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Outputs minimal messages. Multiple
specification of this option will create more verbose
messages.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Specifies quiet operation with no
messages.</p>

<p>-lfilename , --log-file=filename Specifies a log file to
output messages.</p>

<p>-?, -h, --help Prints help information about this
command.</p>

<p>-V, --version Prints version information about this
command.</p>

<p>-Joption Passes the specified option to the Java Virtual
Machine. For more information, see the reference page for
the java(1) command. For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup
memory to 48 MB.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are returned: 0
for successful completion and a number greater than 0 when
an error occurs.</p>

<p>NOTES This command should not be confused with pack(1).
The pack and pack200 commands are separate products.</p>

<p>The Java SE API Specification provided with the JDK is
the superseding authority, when there are discrepancies.</p>
