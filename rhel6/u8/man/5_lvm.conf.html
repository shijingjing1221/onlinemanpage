<p>LVM.CONF(5) LVM.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME lvm.conf Configuration file for LVM2</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/lvm/lvm.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvm.conf is loaded during the initialisation
phase of lvm(8). This file can in turn lead to other files
being loaded - settings read in later override earlier
settings. File timestamps are checked between commands and
if any have changed, all the files are reloaded.</p>

<p>The settings defined in lvm.conf can be overridden by
any of these extended configuration methods:</p>

<p>direct config override on command line The --config
ConfigurationString command line option takes the
ConfigurationString as direct string representation of the
con- figuration to override the existing configuration. The
Configu- rationString is of exactly the same format as used
in any LVM configuration file.</p>

<p>profile config A profile is a set of selected
customizable configuration set- tings that are aimed to
achieve a certain characteristics in various environments or
uses. It s used to override existing configuration.
Normally, the name of the profile should reflect that
environment or use.</p>

<p>There are two groups of profiles recognised: command
profiles and metadata profiles.</p>

<p>The command profile is used to override selected
configuration settings at global LVM command level - it is
applied at the very beginning of LVM command execution and
it is used throughout the whole time of LVM command
execution. The command profile is applied by using the
--commandprofile ProfileName command line option that is
recognised by all LVM2 commands.</p>

<p>The metadata profile is used to override selected
configuration settings at Volume Group/Logical Volume level
- it is applied independently for each Volume Group/Logical
Volume that is being processed. As such, each Volume
Group/Logical Volume can store the profile name used in its
metadata so next time the Volume Group/Logical Volume is
processed, the profile is applied auto- matically. If Volume
Group and any of its Logical Volumes have different profiles
defined, the profile defined for the Logical Volume is
preferred. The metadata profile can be attached/detached by
using the lvchange and vgchange commands and their
--metadataprofile ProfileName and --detachprofile options or
the --metadataprofile option during creation when using
vgcreate or lvcreate command. The vgs and lvs reporting
commands provide -o vg_profile and -o lv_profile output
options to show the metadata profile currently attached to a
Volume Group or a Logical Volume.</p>

<p>The set of options allowed for command profiles is
mutually exclusive when compared to the set of options
allowed for meta- data profiles. The settings that belong to
either of these two sets can t be mixed together and LVM
tools will reject such pro- files.</p>

<p>LVM itself provides a few predefined configuration
profiles. Users are allowed to add more profiles with
different values if needed. For this purpose, there s the
command_profile_tem- plate.profile (for command profiles)
and metadata_profile_tem- plate.profile (for metadata
profiles) which contain all settings that are customizable
by profiles of certain type. Users are encouraged to copy
these template profiles and edit them as needed.
Alternatively, the lvmconfig --file &lt;ProfileName.pro-
file&gt; --type profilable-command &lt;section&gt; or
lvmconfig --file &lt;ProfileName.profile&gt; --type
profilable-metadata &lt;section&gt; can be used to generate
a configuration with profilable settings in either of the
type for given section and save it to new Profile-
Name.profile (if the section is not specified, all
profilable settings are reported).</p>

<p>The profiles are stored in /etc/lvm/profile directory by
default. This location can be changed by using the
config/pro- file_dir setting. Each profile configuration is
stored in Pro- fileName.profile file in the profile
directory. When referencing the profile, the .profile suffix
is left out.</p>

<p>tag config See tags configuration setting description
below.</p>

<p>When several configuration methods are used at the same
time and when LVM looks for the value of a particular
setting, it traverses this con- fig cascade from left to
right:</p>

<p>direct config override on command line -&gt; command
profile config -&gt; metadata profile config -&gt; tag
config -&gt; lvmlocal.conf -&gt; lvm.conf</p>

<p>No part of this cascade is compulsory. If thers no
setting value found at the end of the cascade, a default
value is used for that set- ting. Use lvmconfig to check
what settings are in use and what the default values
are.</p>

<p>SYNTAX This section describes the configuration file
syntax.</p>

<p>Whitespace is not significant unless it is within
quotes. This pro- vides a wide choice of acceptable
indentation styles. Comments begin with # and continue to
the end of the line. They are treated as whitespace.</p>

<p>Here is an informal grammar:</p>

<p>file = value* A configuration file consists of a set of
values.</p>

<p>value = section | assignment A value can either be a new
section, or an assignment.</p>

<p>section = identifier { value* } A section groups
associated values together. If the same section is
encountered multiple times, the contents of all instances
are concatenated together in the order of appearance. It is
denoted by a name and delimited by curly brackets. e.g.
backup { ... }</p>

<p>assignment = identifier = ( array | type ) An assignment
associates a type with an identifier. If the iden- tifier
contains forward slashes, those are interpreted as path
delimiters. The statement section/key = value is equivalent
to section { key = value }. If multiple instances of the
same key are encountered, only the last value is used (and a
warning is issued). e.g. level = 7</p>

<p>array = [ ( type ,)* type ] | [ ] Inhomogeneous arrays
are supported. Elements must be separated by commas. An
empty array is acceptable.</p>

<p>type = integer | float | string integer = [0-9]* float =
[0-9]*.[0-9]* string = &quot;.*&quot;</p>

<p>Strings with spaces must be enclosed in double quotes,
single words that start with a letter can be left
unquoted.</p>

<p>SETTINGS The lvmconfig command prints the LVM
configuration settings in various ways. See the man page
lvmconfig(8).</p>

<p>Command to print a list of all possible config settings,
with their default values: lvmconfig --type default</p>

<p>Command to print a list of all possible config settings,
with their default values, and a full description of each as
a comment: lvmconfig --type default --withcomments</p>

<p>Command to print a list of all possible config settings,
with their current values (configured, non-default values
are shown): lvmconfig --type current</p>

<p>Command to print all config settings that have been
configured with a different value than the default
(configured, non-default values are shown): lvmconfig --type
diff</p>

<p>Command to print a single config setting, with its
default value, and a full description, where
&quot;Section&quot; refers to the config section, e.g.
global, and &quot;Setting&quot; refers to the name of the
specific setting, e.g. umask: lvmconfig --type default
--withcomments Section/Setting</p>

/etc/lvm/archive /etc/lvm/backup /etc/lvm/cache/.cache
