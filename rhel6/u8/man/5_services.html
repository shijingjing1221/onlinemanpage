<p>SERVICES(5) Linux Programmer s Manual SERVICES(5)</p>

<p>NAME services - Internet network services list</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION services is a plain ASCII file providing a
mapping between human- friendly textual names for internet
services, and their underlying assigned port numbers and
protocol types. Every networking program should look into
this file to get the port number (and protocol) for its
service. The C library routines getservent(3),
getservbyname(3), getservbyport(3), setservent(3), and
endservent(3) support querying this file from programs.</p>

<p>Port numbers are assigned by the IANA (Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority), and their current policy is to assign
both TCP and UDP pro- tocols when assigning a port number.
Therefore, most entries will have two entries, even for
TCP-only services.</p>

<p>Port numbers below 1024 (so-called &quot;low
numbered&quot; ports) can only be bound to by root (see
bind(2), tcp(7), and udp(7)). This is so clients connecting
to low numbered ports can trust that the service running on
the port is the standard implementation, and not a rogue
service run by a user of the machine. Well-known port
numbers specified by the IANA are normally located in this
root-only space.</p>

<p>The presence of an entry for a service in the services
file does not necessarily mean that the service is currently
running on the machine. See inetd.conf(5) for the
configuration of Internet services offered. Note that not
all networking services are started by inetd(8), and so wont
appear in inetd.conf(5). In particular, news (NNTP) and mail
(SMTP) servers are often initialized from the system boot
scripts.</p>

<p>The location of the services file is defined by
_PATH_SERVICES in &lt;netdb.h&gt;. This is usually set to
/etc/services.</p>

<p>Each line describes one service, and is of the form:</p>

<p>service-name port/protocol [aliases ...]</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>service-name is the friendly name the service is known
by and looked up under. It is case sensitive. Often, the
client program is named after the service-name.</p>

<p>port is the port number (in decimal) to use for this
service.</p>

<p>protocol is the type of protocol to be used. This field
should match an entry in the protocols(5) file. Typical
values include tcp and udp.</p>

<p>aliases is an optional space or tab separated list of
other names for this service (but see the BUGS section
below). Again, the names are case sensitive.</p>

<p>Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the
fields.</p>

<p>Comments are started by the hash sign (#) and continue
until the end of the line. Blank lines are skipped.</p>

<p>The service-name should begin in the first column of the
file, since leading spaces are not stripped. service-names
can be any printable characters excluding space and tab.
However, a conservative choice of characters should be used
to minimize compatibility problems. E.g., a-z, 0-9, and
hyphen (-) would seem a sensible choice.</p>

<p>Lines not matching this format should not be present in
the file. (Currently, they are silently skipped by
getservent(3), getservby- name(3), and getservbyport(3).
However, this behavior should not be relied on.)</p>

<p>This file might be distributed over a network using a
network-wide nam- ing service like Yellow Pages/NIS or
BIND/Hesiod.</p>

<p>A sample services file might look like this:</p>

<p>netstat 15/tcp qotd 17/tcp quote msp 18/tcp # message
send protocol msp 18/udp # message send protocol chargen
19/tcp ttytst source chargen 19/udp ttytst source ftp 21/tcp
# 22 - unassigned telnet 23/tcp</p>
