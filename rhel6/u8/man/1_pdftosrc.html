<p>NAME pdftosrc - extract source file or stream from PDF
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pdftosrc PDF-file [ stream-object-number ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If only PDF-file is given as argument,
pdftosrc extracts the embedded source file from the first
found stream object with /Type /SourceFile within the
PDF-file and writes it to a file with the name /SourceName
as defined in that PDF stream object (see application
example below).</p>

<p>If both PDF-file and stream-object-number are given as
arguments, and stream-object-number is positive, pdftosrc
extracts and uncompresses the PDF stream of the object given
by its stream-object-number from the PDF-file and writes it
to a file named PDF-file.stream-object-number with the
ending .pdf or .PDF stripped from the original PDF-file
name.</p>

<p>A special case is related to XRef object streams that
are part of the PDF standard from PDF-1.5 onward: If
stream-object-number equals -1, then pdftosrc decompresses
the XRef stream from the PDF file and writes it in
human-readable PDF cross-reference table format to a file
named PDF-file.xref (these XRef streams can not be extracted
just by giving their object number).</p>

<p>In any case an existing file with the output file name
will be over- written.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>FILES Just the executable pdftosrc.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT None.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS At success the exit code of pdftosrc is 0,
else 1.</p>

<p>All messages go to stderr. At program invocation,
pdftosrc issues the current version number of the program
xpdf, on which pdftosrc is based:</p>

<p>pdftosrc version 3.01</p>

<p>When pdftosrc was successful with the output file
writing, one of the following messages will be issued:</p>

<p>Source file extracted to source-file-name</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Stream object extracted to
PDF-file.stream-object-number</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Cross-reference table extracted to PDF-file.xref</p>

<p>When the object given by the stream-object-number does
not contain a stream, pdftosrc issues the following error
message:</p>

<p>Not a Stream object</p>

<p>When the PDF-file cant be opened, the error message
is:</p>

<p>Error: Couldnt open file PDF-file.</p>

<p>When pdftosrc encounters an invalid PDF file, the error
message (sev- eral lines) is:</p>

<p>Error: May not be a PDF file (continuing anyway) (more
lines) Invalid PDF file</p>

<p>There are also more error messages from pdftosrc for
various kinds of broken PDF files.</p>

<p>NOTES An embedded source file will be written out
unchanged, i. e. it will not be uncompressed in this
process.</p>

<p>Only the stream of the object will be written, i. e. not
the dictionary of that object.</p>

<p>Knowing which stream-object-number to query requires
information about the PDF file that has to be gained
elsewhere, e. g. by looking into the PDF file with an
editor.</p>

<p>The stream extraction capabilities of pdftosrc (e. g.
regarding under- stood PDF versions and filter types) follow
the capabilities of the underlying xpdf program version.</p>

<p>Currently the generation number of the stream object is
not supported. The default value 0 (zero) is taken.</p>

<p>The wording stream-object-number has nothing to do with
the object streams introduced by the Adobe PDF Reference,
5th edition, version 1.6.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES When using pdftex, a source file can be
embedded into some PDF-file by using pdftex primitives, as
illustrated by the following example:</p>

<p>immediatedfobj stream attr {/Type /SourceFile
/SourceName (myfile.zip)} file{myfile.zip}
dfcatalog{/SourceObject hedflastobjce 0 R}</p>

<p>Then this zip file can be extracted from the PDF-file by
calling pdftosrc PDF-file.</p>

<p>BUGS Not all embedded source files will be extracted,
only the first found one.</p>
