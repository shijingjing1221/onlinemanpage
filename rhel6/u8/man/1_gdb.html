<p>NAME gdb - The GNU Debugger</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gdb [-help] [-nx] [-q] [-batch] [-cd=dir] [-f]
[-b bps] [-tty=dev] [-s symfile] [-e prog] [-se prog] [-c
core] [-x cmds] [-d dir] [prog[core|procID]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to
allow you to see what is going on inside another program
while it executesor what another program was doing at the
moment it crashed.</p>

<p>GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things
in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:</p>

<p>&middot; Start your program, specifying anything that
might affect its behavior.</p>

<p>&middot; Make your program stop on specified
conditions.</p>

<p>&middot; Examine what has happened, when your program
has stopped.</p>

<p>&middot; Change things in your program, so you can
experiment with cor- recting the effects of one bug and go
on to learn about another.</p>

<p>You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, and
Modula-2. Fortran support will be added when a GNU Fortran
compiler is ready.</p>

<p>GDB is invoked with the shell command gdb. Once started,
it reads com- mands from the terminal until you tell it to
exit with the GDB command quit. You can get online help from
gdb itself by using the command help.</p>

<p>You can run gdb with no arguments or options; but the
most usual way to start GDB is with one argument or two,
specifying an executable program as the argument:</p>

<p>gdb program</p>

<p>You can also start with both an executable program and a
core file specified:</p>

<p>gdb program core</p>

<p>You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second
argument, if you want to debug a running process:</p>

<p>gdb program 1234</p>

<p>would attach GDB to process 1234 (unless you also have a
file named 1234; GDB does check for a core file first).</p>

<p>Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB
commands:</p>

<p>break [file:]function Set a breakpoint at function (in
file).</p>

<p>run [arglist] Start your program (with arglist, if
specified).</p>

<p>bt Backtrace: display the program stack.</p>

<p>print expr Display the value of an expression.</p>

<p>c Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at
a break- point).</p>

<p>next Execute next program line (after stopping); step
over any func- tion calls in the line.</p>

<p>edit [file:]function look at the program line where it
is presently stopped.</p>

<p>list [file:]function type the text of the program in the
vicinity of where it is presently stopped.</p>

<p>step Execute next program line (after stopping); step
into any func- tion calls in the line.</p>

<p>help [name] Show information about GDB command name, or
general information about using GDB.</p>

<p>quit Exit from GDB.</p>

<p>For full details on GDB, see Using GDB: A Guide to the
GNU Source-Level Debugger, by Richard M. Stallman and Roland
H. Pesch. The same text is available online as the gdb entry
in the info program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Any arguments other than options specify an
executable file and core file (or process ID); that is, the
first argument encountered with no associated option flag is
equivalent to a -se option, and the second, if any, is
equivalent to a -c option if its the name of a file. Many
options have both long and short forms; both are shown here.
The long forms are also recognized if you truncate them, so
long as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous.
(If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with + rather
than - , though we illustrate the more usual
convention.)</p>

<p>All the options and command line arguments you give are
processed in sequential order. The order makes a difference
when the -x option is used.</p>

<p>-help</p>

<p>-h List all options, with brief explanations.</p>

<p>-symbols=file</p>

<p>-s file Read symbol table from file file.</p>

<p>-write Enable writing into executable and core
files.</p>

<p>-exec=file</p>

<p>-e file Use file file as the executable file to execute
when appropri- ate, and for examining pure data in
conjunction with a core dump.</p>

<p>-se=file Read symbol table from file file and use it as
the executable file.</p>

<p>-core=file</p>

<p>-c file Use file file as a core dump to examine.</p>

<p>-command=file</p>

<p>-x file Execute GDB commands from file file.</p>

<p>-directory=directory</p>

<p>-d directory Add directory to the path to search for
source files.</p>

<p>-nx</p>

<p>-n Do not execute commands from any .gdbinit
initialization files. Normally, the commands in these files
are executed after all the command options and arguments
have been processed.</p>

<p>-quiet</p>

<p>-q Quiet . Do not print the introductory and copyright
mes- sages. These messages are also suppressed in batch
mode.</p>

<p>-batch Run in batch mode. Exit with status 0 after
processing all the command files specified with -x (and
.gdbinit, if not inhib- ited). Exit with nonzero status if
an error occurs in executing the GDB commands in the command
files.</p>

<p>Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter,
for exam- ple to download and run a program on another
computer; in order to make this more useful, the message</p>

<p>Program exited normally.</p>

<p>(which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running
under GDB control terminates) is not issued when running in
batch mode.</p>

<p>-cd=directory Run GDB using directory as its working
directory, instead of the current directory.</p>

<p>-fullname</p>

<p>-f Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a
subprocess. It tells GDB to output the full file name and
line number in a standard, recognizable fashion each time a
stack frame is dis- played (which includes each time the
program stops). This rec- ognizable format looks like two 32
characters, followed by the file name, line number and
character position separated by colons, and a newline. The
Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two 32 characters as
a signal to display the source code for the frame.</p>

<p>-b bps Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second)
of any serial interface used by GDB for remote
debugging.</p>

<p>-tty=device Run using device for your programs standard
input and output.</p>
