<p>GETC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getc - get a byte from a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getc(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getc() function shall be equivalent to
fgetc(), except that if it is implemented as a macro it may
evaluate stream more than once, so the argument should never
be an expression with side effects.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to fgetc().</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fgetc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the integer value returned by
getc() is stored into a variable of type char and then
compared against the integer constant EOF, the com- parison
may never succeed, because sign-extension of a variable of
type char on widening to integer is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>Since it may be implemented as a macro, getc() may treat
incorrectly a stream argument with side effects. In
particular, getc(*f++) does not necessarily work as
expected. Therefore, use of this function should be preceded
by &quot;#undef getc&quot; in such situations; fgetc() could
also be used.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
