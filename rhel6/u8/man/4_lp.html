<p>NAME lp - line printer devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/lp.h&gt;</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION lp[0 2] are character devices for the
parallel line printers; they have major number 6 and minor
number 02. The minor numbers correspond to the printer port
base addresses 0x03bc, 0x0378 and 0x0278. Usually they have
mode 220 and are owned by root and group lp. You can use
printer ports either with polling or with interrupts.
Interrupts are recommended when high traffic is expected,
for example, for laser printers. For usual dot matrix
printers polling will usually be enough. The default is
polling.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The following ioctl(2) calls are
supported:</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPTIME, int arg) Sets the amount of
time that the driver sleeps before rechecking the printer
when the printers buffer appears to be filled to arg. If you
have a fast printer, decrease this number; if you have a
slow printer then increase it. This is in hundredths of a
second, the default 2 being 0.02 seconds. It only influences
the polling driver.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPCHAR, int arg) Sets the maximum
number of busy-wait iterations which the polling driver does
while waiting for the printer to get ready for receiving a
character to arg. If printing is too slow, increase this
number; if the system gets too slow, decrease this number.
The default is 1000. It only influences the polling
driver.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPABORT, int arg) If arg is 0, the
printer driver will retry on errors, otherwise it will
abort. The default is 0.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPABORTOPEN, int arg) If arg is 0,
open(2) will be aborted on error, otherwise error will be
ignored. The default is to ignore it.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPCAREFUL, int arg) If arg is 0, then
the out-of-paper, offline and error signals are required to
be false on all writes, otherwise they are ignored. The
default is to ignore them.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPWAIT, int arg) Sets the number of
busy waiting iterations to wait before strob- ing the
printer to accept a just-written character, and the num- ber
of iterations to wait before turning the strobe off again,
to arg. The specification says this time should be 0.5
microseconds, but experience has shown the delay caused by
the code is already enough. For that reason, the default
value is 0. This is used for both the polling and the
interrupt driver.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPSETIRQ, int arg) This ioctl(2)
requires superuser privileges. It takes an int containing
the new IRQ as argument. As a side effect, the printer will
be reset. When arg is 0, the polling driver will be used,
which is also default.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPGETIRQ, int *arg) Stores the
currently used IRQ in arg.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPGETSTATUS, int *arg) Stores the
value of the status port in arg. The bits have the following
meaning:</p>

<p>LP_PBUSY inverted busy input, active high LP_PACK
unchanged acknowledge input, active low LP_POUTPA unchanged
out-of-paper input, active high LP_PSELECD unchanged
selected input, active high LP_PERRORP unchanged error
input, active low</p>

<p>Refer to your printer manual for the meaning of the
signals. Note that undocumented bits may also be set,
depending on your printer.</p>

<p>int ioctl(int fd, LPRESET) Resets the printer. No
argument is used.</p>
