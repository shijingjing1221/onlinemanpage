<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_GETSTACKADDR(3POSIX Programmer s
ManPTHREAD_ATTR_GETSTACKADDR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_getstackaddr,
pthread_attr_setstackaddr - get and set the stackaddr
attribute</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_getstackaddr(const pthread_attr_t
*restrict attr, void **restrict stackaddr); int
pthread_attr_setstackaddr(pthread_attr_t *attr, void
*stackaddr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_getstackaddr() and
pthread_attr_setstackaddr() func- tions, respectively, shall
get and set the thread creation stackaddr attribute in the
attr object.</p>

<p>The stackaddr attribute specifies the location of
storage to be used for the created threads stack. The size
of the storage shall be at least {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN}.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
pthread_attr_getstackaddr() and pthread_attr_setstackaddr()
shall return a value of 0; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getstackaddr() function stores the
stackaddr attribute value in stackaddr if successful.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The specification of the stackaddr
attribute presents several ambigui- ties that make portable
use of these interfaces impossible. The description of the
single address parameter as a &quot;stack&quot; does not
spec- ify a particular relationship between the address and
the &quot;stack&quot; implied by that address. For example,
the address may be taken as the low memory address of a
buffer intended for use as a stack, or it may be taken as
the address to be used as the initial stack pointer regis-
ter value for the new thread. These two are not the same
except for a machine on which the stack grows &quot;up&quot;
from low memory to high, and on which a &quot;push&quot;
operation first stores the value in memory and then
increments the stack pointer register. Further, on a machine
where the stack grows &quot;down&quot; from high memory to
low, interpretation of the address as the &quot;low
memory&quot; address requires a determination of the
intended size of the stack. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 has
introduced the new interfaces pthread_attr_setstack() and
pthread_attr_getstack() to resolve these ambiguities.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
