<p>NAME mime.types - mime type description file for
cups</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mime.types file defines the recognized
file types.</p>

<p>Additional file types can be added to mime.types or
(preferably) in additional files in the CUPS configuration
directory with the extension &quot;.types&quot;.</p>

<p>Each line in the mime.types file is a comment, blank, or
rule line. Comment lines start with the # character. Rule
lines start with the MIME type name and are optionally
followed by a series of file recogni- tion rules that are
used to automatically identify print and web files:</p>

<p>super/type rule [ ... ruleN] MIME type names are
case-insensitive and are sorted in ascending alphanumeric
order for the purposes of matching. See the &quot;TYPE
MATCHING AND PRIORITY&quot; section for more
information.</p>

<p>The rules may be grouped using parenthesis, joined using
&quot;+&quot; for a log- ical AND and &quot;,&quot; or
whitespace for a logical OR, and negated using
&quot;!&quot;.</p>

<p>RULES Rules take two forms - a filename extension by
itself and functions with test values inside parenthesis.
The following functions are avail- able:</p>

<p>match(&quot;pattern&quot;) Pattern match on filename</p>

<p>ascii(offset,length) True if bytes are valid printable
ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126)</p>

<p>printable(offset,length) True if bytes are printable
8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126, 128-254)</p>

<p>priority(number) Specifies the relative priority of this
MIME type. The default priority is 100. Larger values have
higher priority while smaller values have lower
priority.</p>

<p>string(offset,&quot;string&quot;) True if bytes are
identical to string</p>

<p>istring(offset,&quot;string&quot;) True if a
case-insensitive comparison of the bytes is identical</p>

<p>char(offset,value) True if byte is identical</p>

<p>short(offset,value) True if 16-bit integer is
identical</p>

<p>int(offset,value) True if 32-bit integer is
identical</p>

<p>locale(&quot;string&quot;) True if current locale
matches string</p>

<p>contains(offset,range,&quot;string&quot;) True if the
range contains the string</p>

<p>STRING CONSTANTS String constants can be specified
inside quotes (&quot;&quot;) for strings con- taining
whitespace and angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) for hexadecimal
strings.</p>

<p>TYPE MATCHING AND PRIORITY When CUPS needs to determine
the MIME type of a given file, it checks every MIME type
defined in the .types files. When two types have the same
matching rules, the type chosen will depend on the type name
and priority, with higher- priority types being used over
lower-priority ones. If the types have the same priority,
the type names are sorted alphanumerically in ascending
order and the first type is chosen.</p>

<p>For example, if two types &quot;text/bar&quot; and
&quot;text/foo&quot; are defined as matching the extension
&quot;doc&quot;, normally the type &quot;text/bar&quot; will
be cho- sen since its name is alphanumerically smaller than
&quot;text/foo&quot;. How- ever, if &quot;text/foo&quot;
also defines a higher priority than &quot;text/bar&quot;,
&quot;text/foo&quot; will be chosen instead.</p>
