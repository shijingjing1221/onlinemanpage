<p>CLASS_FIND_DEVICE(9) Device drivers infrastructure
CLASS_FIND_DEVICE(9)</p>

<p>NAME class_find_device - device iterator for locating a
particular device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct device * class_find_device(struct class
* class, struct device * start, void * data, int (*match)
(struct device *, void *));</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS class the class we&acute;re iterating</p>

<p>start Device to begin with</p>

<p>data data for the match function</p>

<p>match function to check device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is similar to the class_for_each_dev
function above, but it returns a reference to a device that
is &acute;found&acute; for later use, as determined by the
match callback.</p>

<p>The callback should return 0 if the device doesn&acute;t
match and non-zero if it does. If the callback returns
non-zero, this function will return to the caller and not
iterate over any more devices.</p>

<p>Note, you will need to drop the reference with
put_device after use.</p>

<p>fn is allowed to do anything including calling back into
class code. There&acute;s no locking restriction.</p>
