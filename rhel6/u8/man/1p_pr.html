<p>PR(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PR(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pr - print files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pr [+page][-column][-adFmrt][-e[char][ gap]][-h
header][-i[char][gap]]</p>

<p>[-l lines][-n[char][width]][-o offset][-s[char]][-w
width][-fp] [file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pr utility is a printing and pagination
filter. If multiple input files are specified, each shall be
read, formatted, and written to standard output. By default,
the input shall be separated into 66-line pages, each
with:</p>

<p>* A 5-line header that includes the page number, date,
time, and the pathname of the file</p>

<p>* A 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines</p>

<p>If standard output is associated with a terminal,
diagnostic messages shall be deferred until the pr utility
has completed processing.</p>

<p>When options specifying multi-column output are
specified, output text columns shall be of equal width;
input lines that do not fit into a text column shall be
truncated. By default, text columns shall be sepa- rated
with at least one &lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The pr utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that: the page option has
a + delimiter; page and column can be multi-digit numbers;
some of the option-arguments are optional; and some of the
option-arguments cannot be specified as separate arguments
from the preceding option letter. In particular, the -s
option does not allow the option letter to be separated from
its argument, and the options -e, -i, and -n require that
both arguments, if present, not be separated from the option
letter.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported. In the
following option descriptions, column, lines, offset, page,
and width are positive deci- mal integers; gap is a
non-negative decimal integer.</p>

<p>+page Begin output at page number page of the formatted
input.</p>

<p>-column Produce multi-column output that is arranged in
column columns (the default shall be 1) and is written down
each column in the order in which the text is received from
the input file. This option should not be used with -m. The
options -e and -i shall be assumed for multiple text-column
output. Whether or not text columns are produced with
identical vertical lengths is unspeci- fied, but a text
column shall never exceed the length of the page (see the -l
option). When used with -t, use the minimum number of lines
to write the output.</p>

<p>-a Modify the effect of the - column option so that the
columns are filled across the page in a round-robin order
(for example, when column is 2, the first input line heads
column 1, the second heads column 2, the third is the second
line in column 1, and so on).</p>

<p>-d Produce output that is double-spaced; append an extra
&lt;newline&gt; following every &lt;newline&gt; found in the
input.</p>

<p>-e[char][gap]</p>

<p>Expand each input &lt;tab&gt; to the next greater column
position specified by the formula n* gap+1, where n is an
integer &gt; 0. If gap is zero or is omitted, it shall
default to 8. All &lt;tab&gt;s in the input shall be
expanded into the appropriate number of &lt;space&gt;s. If
any non-digit character, char, is specified, it shall be
used as the input &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>-f Use a &lt;form-feed&gt; for new pages, instead of the
default behavior that uses a sequence of &lt;newline&gt;s.
Pause before beginning the first page if the standard output
is associated with a terminal.</p>

<p>-F Use a &lt;form-feed&gt; for new pages, instead of the
default behavior that uses a sequence of
&lt;newline&gt;s.</p>

<p>-h header Use the string header to replace the contents
of the file operand in the page header.</p>

<p>-i[char][gap] In output, replace multiple &lt;space&gt;s
with &lt;tab&gt;s wherever two or more adjacent
&lt;space&gt;s reach column positions gap+1, 2* gap+1, 3*
gap+1, and so on. If gap is zero or is omitted, default tab
settings at every eighth column position shall be assumed.
If any non-digit character, char, is specified, it shall be
used as the output &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>-l lines Override the 66-line default and reset the page
length to lines. If lines is not greater than the sum of
both the header and trailer depths (in lines), the pr
utility shall suppress both the header and trailer, as if
the -t option were in effect.</p>

<p>-m Merge files. Standard output shall be formatted so
the pr util- ity writes one line from each file specified by
a file operand, side by side into text columns of equal
fixed widths, in terms of the number of column positions.
Implementations shall sup- port merging of at least nine
file operands.</p>

<p>-n[char][width]</p>

<p>Provide width-digit line numbering (default for width
shall be 5). The number shall occupy the first width column
positions of each text column of default output or each line
of -m output. If char (any non-digit character) is given, it
shall be appended to the line number to separate it from
whatever follows (default for char is a &lt;tab&gt;).</p>

<p>-o offset Each line of output shall be preceded by
offset &lt;space&gt;s. If the -o option is not specified,
the default offset shall be zero. The space taken is in
addition to the output line width (see the -w option
below).</p>

<p>-p Pause before beginning each page if the standard
output is directed to a terminal ( pr shall write an
&lt;alert&gt; to standard error and wait for a
&lt;carriage-return&gt; to be read on /dev/tty).</p>

<p>-r Write no diagnostic reports on failure to open
files.</p>

<p>-s[char] Separate text columns by the single character
char instead of by the appropriate number of &lt;space&gt;s
(default for char shall be &lt;tab&gt;).</p>

<p>-t Write neither the five-line identifying header nor
the five-line trailer usually supplied for each page. Quit
writing after the last line of each file without spacing to
the end of the page.</p>

<p>-w width Set the width of the line to width column
positions for multiple text-column output only. If the -w
option is not specified and the -s option is not specified,
the default width shall be 72. If the -w option is not
specified and the -s option is speci- fied, the default
width shall be 512.</p>

<p>For single column output, input lines shall not be
truncated.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be written. If no file
operands are specified, or if a file operand is-, the
standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is- . See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>The file /dev/tty shall be used to read responses
required by the -p option.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of pr:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and which characters are defined as
printable (character class print). Non-printable characters
are still written to standard output, but are not counted
for the purpose for column-width and line-length
calculations.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format of the date and time for
use in writing header lines.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used to calculate date and
time strings written in header lines. If TZ is unset or
null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS If pr receives an interrupt while
writing to a terminal, it shall flush all accumulated error
messages to the screen before terminating.</p>

<p>STDOUT The pr utility output shall be a paginated
version of the original file (or files). This pagination
shall be accomplished using either &lt;form- feed&gt;s or a
sequence of &lt;newline&gt;s, as controlled by the -F or -f
option. Page headers shall be generated unless the -t option
is speci- fied. The page headers shall be of the form:</p>

<p>n%s %s Page %n&quot;, &lt;output of date&gt;,
&lt;file&gt;, &lt;page number&gt;</p>

<p>In the POSIX locale, the &lt;output of date&gt; field,
representing the date and time of last modification of the
input file (or the current date and time if the input file
is standard input), shall be equivalent to the output of the
following command as it would appear if executed at the
given time:</p>

<p>date &quot;+%b %e %H:%M %Y&quot;</p>

<p>without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, if the page being
written is from stan- dard input. If the page being written
is not from standard input, in the POSIX locale, the same
format shall be used, but the time used shall be the
modification time of the file corresponding to file instead
of the current time. When the LC_TIME locale category is not
set to the POSIX locale, a different format and order of
presentation of this field may be used.</p>

<p>If the standard input is used instead of a file operand,
the &lt;file&gt; field shall be replaced by a null
string.</p>

<p>If the -h option is specified, the &lt;file&gt; field
shall be replaced by the header argument.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used for diagnostic
messages and for alert- ing the terminal when -p is
specified.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Print a numbered list of all files in the
current directory:</p>

<p>ls -a | pr -n -h &quot;Files in $(pwd).&quot;</p>

<p>2. Print file1 and file2 as a double-spaced,
three-column listing headed by &quot;file list:</p>

<p>pr -3d -h &quot;file list&quot; file1 file2</p>

<p>3. Write file1 on file2, expanding tabs to columns 10,
19, 28, ...:</p>

<p>pr -e9 -t &lt;file1 &gt;file2</p>

<p>RATIONALE This utility is one of those that does not
follow the Utility Syntax Guidelines because of its
historical origins. The standard developers could have added
new options that obeyed the guidelines (and marked the old
options obsolescent) or devised an entirely new utility;
there are examples of both actions in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001. Because of its widespread use by historical
applications, the standard developers decided to exempt this
version of pr from many of the guide- lines.</p>

<p>Implementations are required to accept option-arguments
to the -h, -l, -o, and -w options whether presented as part
of the same argument or as a separate argument to pr, as
suggested by the Utility Syntax Guide- lines. The -n and -s
options, however, are specified as in historical practice
because they are frequently specified without their optional
arguments. If a &lt;blank&gt; were allowed before the
option-argument in these cases, a file operand could
mistakenly be interpreted as an option-argument in
historical applications.</p>

<p>The text about the minimum number of lines in
multi-column output was included to ensure that a best
effort is made in balancing the length of the columns. There
are known historical implementations in which, for example,
60-line files are listed by pr -2 as one column of 56 lines
and a second of 4. Although this is not a problem when a
full page with headers and trailers is produced, it would be
relatively use- less when used with -t.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of the pr utility have
differed in the action taken for the -f option. BSD uses it
as described here for the -F option; System V uses it to
change trailing &lt;newline&gt;s on each page to a
&lt;form-feed&gt; and, if standard output is a TTY device,
sends an &lt;alert&gt; to standard error and reads a line
from /dev/tty before the first page. There were strong
arguments from both sides of this issue concerning
historical practice and as a result the -F option was added.
XSI-conformant systems support the System V historical
actions for the -f option.</p>

<p>The &lt;output of date&gt; field in the -l format is
specified only for the POSIX locale. As noted, the format
can be different in other locales. No mechanism for defining
this is present in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, as
the appropriate vehicle is a message catalog; that is, the
format should be specified as a &quot;message&quot;.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
