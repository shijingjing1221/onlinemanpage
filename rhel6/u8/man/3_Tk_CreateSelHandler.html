<p>Tk_CreateSelHandler(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_CreateSelHandler(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CreateSelHandler, Tk_DeleteSelHandler - arrange
to handle requests for a selection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_CreateSelHandler(tkwin, selection, target, proc,
clientData, format)</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteSelHandler(tkwin, selection, target)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Window for which proc
will provide selection informa- tion.</p>

<p>Atom selection (in) The name of the selection for which
proc will provide selection information.</p>

<p>Atom target (in) Form in which proc can pro- vide the
selection (e.g. STRING or FILE_NAME). Corre- sponds to type
arguments in selection commands.</p>

<p>Tk_SelectionProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke whenever
the selection is owned by tkwin and the selection con- tents
are requested in the format given by target.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.</p>

<p>Atom format (in) If the selection requestor is not in
this process, format determines the representation used to
transmit the selec- tion to its requestor.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_CreateSelHandler arranges for a
particular procedure (proc) to be called whenever selection
is owned by tkwin and the selection contents are requested
in the form given by target. Target should be one of the
entries defined in the left column of Table 2 of the X
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM) or any
other form in which an application is willing to present the
selection. The most common form is STRING.</p>

<p>Proc should have arguments and result that match the
type Tk_Selection- Proc: typedef int Tk_SelectionProc(
ClientData clientData, int offset, char *buffer, int
maxBytes); The clientData parameter to proc is a copy of the
clientData argument given to Tk_CreateSelHandler. Typically,
clientData points to a data structure containing
application-specific information that is needed to retrieve
the selection. Offset specifies an offset position into the
selection, buffer specifies a location at which to copy
information about the selection, and maxBytes specifies the
amount of space avail- able at buffer. Proc should place a
NULL-terminated string at buffer containing maxBytes or
fewer characters (not including the terminating NULL), and
it should return a count of the number of non-NULL charac-
ters stored at buffer. If the selection no longer exists
(e.g. it once existed but the user deleted the range of
characters containing it), then proc should return -1.</p>

<p>When transferring large selections, Tk will break them
up into smaller pieces (typically a few thousand bytes each)
for more efficient trans- mission. It will do this by
calling proc one or more times, using suc- cessively higher
values of offset to retrieve successive portions of the
selection. If proc returns a count less than maxBytes it
means that the entire remainder of the selection has been
returned. If procs return value is maxBytes it means there
may be additional infor- mation in the selection, so Tk must
make another call to proc to retrieve the next portion.</p>

<p>Proc always returns selection information in the form of
a character string. However, the ICCCM allows for
information to be transmitted from the selection owner to
the selection requestor in any of several formats, such as a
string, an array of atoms, an array of integers, etc. The
format argument to Tk_CreateSelHandler indicates what format
should be used to transmit the selection to its requestor
(see the mid- dle column of Table 2 of the ICCCM for
examples). If format is not STRING, then Tk will take the
value returned by proc and divided it into fields separated
by white space. If format is ATOM, then Tk will return the
selection as an array of atoms, with each field in procs
result treated as the name of one atom. For any other value
of format, Tk will return the selection as an array of
32-bit values where each field of procs result is treated as
a number and translated to a 32-bit value. In any event, the
format atom is returned to the selec- tion requestor along
with the contents of the selection.</p>

<p>If Tk_CreateSelHandler is called when there already
exists a handler for selection and target on tkwin, then the
existing handler is replaced with a new one.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteSelHandler removes the handler given by tkwin,
selection, and target, if such a handler exists. If there is
no such handler then it has no effect.</p>
