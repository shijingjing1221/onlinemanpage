<p>WCSNCPY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual WCSNCPY(3)</p>

<p>NAME wcsncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide
characters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src,
size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsncpy() function is the wide-character
equivalent of the strncpy(3) function. It copies at most n
wide characters from the wide-character string pointed to by
src, including the terminating L&rsquo; &rsquo; character,
to the array pointed to by dest. Exactly n wide char- acters
are written at dest. If the length wcslen(src) is smaller
than n, the remaining wide characters in the array pointed
to by dest are filled with L&rsquo; &rsquo; characters. If
the length wcslen(src) is greater or equal to n, the string
pointed to by dest will not be L&rsquo; &rsquo;
terminated.</p>

<p>The strings may not overlap.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least n wide char- acters at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE wcsncpy() returns dest.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>
