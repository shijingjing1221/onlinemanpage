<p>TCGETPGRP(3) Linux Programmer s Manual TCGETPGRP(3)</p>

<p>NAME tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp - get and set terminal
foreground process group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t tcgetpgrp(int fd);</p>

<p>int tcsetpgrp(int fd, pid_t pgrp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function tcgetpgrp() returns the process
group ID of the foreground process group on the terminal
associated to fd, which must be the con- trolling terminal
of the calling process.</p>

<p>The function tcsetpgrp() makes the process group with
process group ID pgrp the foreground process group on the
terminal associated to fd, which must be the controlling
terminal of the calling process, and still be associated
with its session. Moreover, pgrp must be a (non- empty)
process group belonging to the same session as the calling
pro- cess.</p>

<p>If tcsetpgrp() is called by a member of a background
process group in its session, and the calling process is not
blocking or ignoring SIGT- TOU, a SIGTTOU signal is sent to
all members of this background process group.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE When fd refers to the controlling terminal
of the calling process, the function tcgetpgrp() will return
the foreground process group ID of that terminal if there is
one, and some value larger than 1 that is not presently a
process group ID otherwise. When fd does not refer to the
controlling terminal of the calling process, -1 is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>When successful, tcsetpgrp() returns 0. Otherwise, it
returns -1, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL pgrp has an unsupported value.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling
terminal, or it has one but it is not described by fd, or,
for tcsetpgrp(), this controlling terminal is no longer
associated with the session of the calling process.</p>

<p>EPERM pgrp has a supported value, but is not the process
group ID of a process in the same session as the calling
process.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES These functions are implemented via the TIOCGPGRP
and TIOCSPGRP ioctls.</p>

<p>History The ioctls appeared in 4.2BSD. The functions are
POSIX inventions.</p>
