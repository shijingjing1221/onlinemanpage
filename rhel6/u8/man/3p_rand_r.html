<p>RAND(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RAND(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME rand, rand_r, srand - pseudo-random number
generator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rand(void);</p>

<p>int rand_r(unsigned *seed); void srand(unsigned
seed);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rand() function shall compute a sequence
of pseudo-random integers in the range [0, {RAND_MAX}] with
a period of at least 2**32.</p>

<p>The rand() function need not be reentrant. A function
that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>The rand_r() function shall compute a sequence of
pseudo-random inte- gers in the range [0, {RAND_MAX}]. (The
value of the {RAND_MAX} macro shall be at least 32767.)</p>

<p>If rand_r() is called with the same initial value for
the object pointed to by seed and that object is not
modified between successive returns and calls to rand_r(),
the same sequence shall be generated.</p>

<p>The srand() function uses the argument as a seed for a
new sequence of pseudo-random numbers to be returned by
subsequent calls to rand(). If srand() is then called with
the same seed value, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers
shall be repeated. If rand() is called before any calls to
srand() are made, the same sequence shall be generated as
when srand() is first called with a seed value of 1.</p>

<p>The implementation shall behave as if no function
defined in this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 calls
rand() or srand().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The rand() function shall return the next
pseudo-random number in the sequence.</p>

<p>The rand_r() function shall return a pseudo-random
integer.</p>

<p>The srand() function shall not return a value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Generating a Pseudo-Random Number Sequence The
following example demonstrates how to generate a sequence of
pseudo-random numbers.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; ...
long count, i; char *keystr; int elementlen, len; char c;
... /* Initial random number generator. */ srand(1);</p>

<p>/* Create keys using only lowercase characters */ len =
0; for (i=0; i&lt;count; i++) { while (len &lt; elementlen)
{ c = (char) (rand() % 128); if (islower(c)) keystr[len++] =
c; }</p>

<p>keystr[len] ; printf(&quot;%s Element%0*ln&quot;,
keystr, elementlen, i); len = 0; }</p>

<p>Generating the Same Sequence on Different Machines The
following code defines a pair of functions that could be
incorpo- rated into applications wishing to ensure that the
same sequence of numbers is generated across different
machines.</p>

<p>static unsigned long next = 1; int myrand(void) /*
RAND_MAX assumed to be 32767. */ { next = next * 1103515245
+ 12345; return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768); }</p>

<p>void mysrand(unsigned seed) { next = seed; }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The drand48() function provides a much
more elaborate random number generator.</p>

<p>The limitations on the amount of state that can be
carried between one function call and another mean the
rand_r() function can never be implemented in a way which
satisfies all of the requirements on a pseudo-random number
generator. Therefore this function should be avoided
whenever non-trivial requirements (including safety) have to
be fulfilled.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The ISO C standard rand() and srand()
functions allow per-process pseudo-random streams shared by
all threads. Those two functions need not change, but there
has to be mutual-exclusion that prevents inter- ference
between two threads concurrently accessing the random number
generator.</p>

<p>With regard to rand(), there are two different behaviors
that may be wanted in a multi-threaded program:</p>

<p>1. A single per-process sequence of pseudo-random
numbers that is shared by all threads that call rand()</p>

<p>2. A different sequence of pseudo-random numbers for
each thread that calls rand()</p>

<p>This is provided by the modified thread-safe function
based on whether the seed value is global to the entire
process or local to each thread.</p>

<p>This does not address the known deficiencies of the
rand() function implementations, which have been approached
by maintaining more state. In effect, this specifies new
thread-safe forms of a deficient func- tion.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
