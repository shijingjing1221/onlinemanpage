<p>NAME pbmclean - flip isolated pixels in portable
bitmap</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmclean [-minneighbors=N] [-black|-white]
[pbmfile]</p>

<p>OPTION USAGE You can use the minimum unique abbreviation
of the options. You can use two hyphens instead of one. You
can separate an option name from its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmclean cleans up a PBM image of random specks. It
reads a PBM image as input and outputs a PBM that is the
same as the input except with isolated pixels inverted. An
isolated pixel is one that has very few neighboring pixels
of the same color. The -minneighbors option gives the number
of same-color neighbors are required.</p>

<p>The default is 1 pixel -- only completely isolated
pixels are flipped.</p>

<p>(A -minneighbors value greater than 8 generates a
completely inverted image (but use pnminvert to do that) --
or a completely white or com- pletely black image with the
-black or -white option).</p>

<p>pbmclean considers the area beyond the edges of the
image to be white. (This matters when you consider pixels
right on the edge of the image).</p>

<p>You can use pbmclean to clean up snow on bitmap
images.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -black</p>

<p>-white Flip pixels of the specified color. By default,
if you specify neither -black nor -white, pbmclean flips
both black and white pixels which do not have sufficient
identical neighbors. If you specify -black, pbmclean leaves
the white pixels alone and just erases isolated black
pixels. Vice versa for -white. You may specify both -black
and -white to get the same as the default behavior.</p>

<p>-minneighbors=N This determines how many pixels must be
in a cluster in order for pbmclean to consider them
legitimate and not clean them out of the image. See
Description .</p>

<p>Before December 2001, pbmclean accepted -N instead of
-minneigh- bors. Before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005),
-minneighbors was -min- neighbor.</p>
