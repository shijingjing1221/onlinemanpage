<p>NAME glutMenuDestroyFunc - Destruction callback for
menus.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - menucallback</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutMenuDestroyFunc(void( *callback )( void ));</p>

<p>PARAMETERS callback Client menu destruction hook.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a menu is destroyed, OpenGLUT will call
this hook, if defined on that menu.</p>

<p>This callback is not bound to any window.</p>

<p>This callback is bound to a specific menu.</p>

<p>CAVEATS For emphasis, we repeat: This callback does not
bind to any window.</p>

<p>TODO What on Earth is rationale for this feature? Menus
should only be destroyed when we ask them to be destroyed,
or when their window is destroyed. In the former case, we
already know that the menu is being destroyed because we
requested it. In the latter case, it is easy for the client
to track that if they care, via window-destruction
callbacks.</p>
