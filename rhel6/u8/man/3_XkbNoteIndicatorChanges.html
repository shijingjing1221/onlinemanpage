<p>XkbNoteIndicatorChanges(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbNoteIndicatorChanges(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbNoteIndicatorChanges - Notes the changes in a
changes structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void XkbNoteIndicatorChanges
(XkbIndicatorChangesPtr old, XkbIndica- torNotifyEvent *new,
unsigned int wanted);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - old XkbIndicatorChanges structure to be
updated</p>

<p>- new event from which changes are to be copied</p>

<p>- wanted which changes are to be noted</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Whenever an indicator changes state, the
server sends XkbIndica- torStateNotify events to all
interested clients. Similarly, whenever an indicator s map
changes, the server sends XkbIndicatorMapNotify events to
all interested clients.</p>

<p>To receive XkbIndicatorStateNotify events, use
XkbSelectEvents with both the bits_to_change and
values_for_bits parameters containing
XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask. To receive
XkbIndicatorMapNotify events, use XkbSelectEvents with
XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask.</p>

<p>To receive events for only specific indicators, use
XkbSelectEventDe- tails. Set the event_type parameter to
XkbIndicatorStateNotify or XkbIndicatorMapNotify, and set
both the bits_to_change and val- ues_for_bits detail
parameters to a mask where each bit specifies one indicator,
turning on those bits that specify the indicators for which
you want to receive events.</p>

<p>The changed parameter is a mask that is the bitwise
inclusive OR of the indicators that have changed. If the
event is of type XkbIndicatorMap- Notify, changed reports
the maps that changed. If the event is of type
XkbIndicatorStateNotify, changed reports the indicators that
have changed state. state is a mask that specifies the
current state of all indicators, whether they have changed
or not, for both XkbIndica- torStateNotify and
IndicatorMapNotify events.</p>

<p>When your client application receives either a
XkbIndicatorStateNotify event or XkbIndicatorMapNotify
event, you can note the changes in a changes structure by
calling XkbNoteIndicatorChanges.</p>

<p>The wanted parameter is the bitwise inclusive OR of
XkbIndicatorMapMask and XkbIndicatorStateMask.
XkbNoteIndicatorChanges copies any changes reported in new
and specified in wanted into the changes record speci- fied
by old.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES Both types of indicator events use the same
structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct _XkbIndicatorNotify { int type; / Xkb
extension base event code */ unsigned long serial; / X
server serial number for event */ Bool send_event; / True
=&gt; synthetically generated */ Display * display; / server
connection where event generated */ Time time; / server time
when event generated */ int xkb_type; / specifies state or
map notify */ int device; / Xkb device ID, will not be
XkbUseCoreKbd */ unsigned int changed; / mask of indicators
with new state or map */ unsigned int state; / current state
of all indicators */ } XkbIndicatorNotifyEvent;</p>

<p>xkb_type is either XkbIndicatorStateNotify or
XkbIndicatorMapNotify, depending on whether the event is a
kbIndicatorStateNotify event or kbIndicatorMapNotify
event.</p>
