<p>REMQUO(3) Linux Programmer s Manual REMQUO(3)</p>

<p>NAME remquo, remquof, remquol - remainder and part of
quotient</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double remquo(double x, double y, int *quo); float
remquof(float x, float y, int *quo); long double
remquol(long double x, long double y, int *quo);</p>

<p>Link with -lm.</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>remquo(), remquof(), remquol(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600
|| _ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions compute the remainder and
part of the quotient upon division of x by y. A few bits of
the quotient are stored via the quo pointer. The remainder
is returned as the function result.</p>

<p>The value of the remainder is the same as that computed
by the remain- der(3) function.</p>

<p>The value stored via the quo pointer has the sign of x /
y and agrees with the quotient in at least the low order 3
bits.</p>

<p>For example, remquo(29.0, 3.0) returns -1.0 and might
store 2. Note that the actual quotient might not fit in an
integer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return the same
value as the analogous functions described in
remainder(3).</p>

<p>If x or y is a NaN, a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If x is an infinity, and y is not a NaN, a domain error
occurs, and a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>If y is zero, and x is not a NaN, a domain error occurs,
and a NaN is returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS See math_error(7) for information on how to
determine whether an error has occurred when calling these
functions.</p>

<p>The following errors can occur:</p>

<p>Domain error: x is an infinity or y is 0, and the other
argument is not a NaN An invalid floating-point exception
(FE_INVALID) is raised.</p>

<p>These functions do not set errno.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions first appeared in glibc in
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>
