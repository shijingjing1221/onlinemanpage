<p>NAME dprofpp - display perl profile data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dprofpp [-a|-z|-l|-v|-U] [-d] [-s|-r|-u] [-q]
[-F] [-I|-E] [-O cnt] [-A] [-R] [-S] [-g subroutine] [-G
&lt;regexp&gt; [-P]] [-f &lt;regexp&gt;] [profile]</p>

<p>dprofpp -T [-F] [-g subroutine] [profile]</p>

<p>dprofpp -t [-F] [-g subroutine] [profile]</p>

<p>dprofpp -G &lt;regexp&gt; [-P] [profile]</p>

<p>dprofpp -p script [-Q] [other opts]</p>

<p>dprofpp -V [profile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The dprofpp command interprets profile data
produced by a profiler, such as the Devel::DProf profiler.
Dprofpp will read the file tmon.out and display the 15
subroutines which are using the most time. By default the
times for each subroutine are given exclusive of the times
of their child subroutines.</p>

<p>To profile a Perl script run the perl interpreter with
the -d switch. So to profile script test.pl with
Devel::DProf use the following:</p>

<p>$ perl5 -d:DProf test.pl</p>

<p>Then run dprofpp to analyze the profile. The output of
dprofpp depends on the flags to the program and the version
of Perl youre using.</p>

<p>$ dprofpp -u Total Elapsed Time = 1.67 Seconds User Time
= 0.61 Seconds Exclusive Times %Time Seconds #Calls sec/call
Name 52.4 0.320 2 0.1600 main::foo 45.9 0.280 200 0.0014
main::bar 0.00 0.000 1 0.0000 DynaLoader::import 0.00 0.000
1 0.0000 main::baz</p>

<p>The dprofpp tool can also run the profiler before
analyzing the profile data. The above two commands can be
executed with one dprofpp command.</p>

<p>$ dprofpp -u -p test.pl</p>

<p>Consult &quot;PROFILE FORMAT&quot; in Devel::DProf for a
description of the raw profile.</p>

<p>OUTPUT Columns are:</p>

<p>%Time Percentage of time spent in this routine.</p>

<p>#Calls Number of calls to this routine.</p>

<p>sec/call Average number of seconds per call to this
routine.</p>

<p>Name Name of routine.</p>

<p>CumulS Time (in seconds) spent in this routine and
routines called from it.</p>

<p>ExclSec Time (in seconds) spent in this routine (not
including those called from it).</p>

<p>Csec/c Average time (in seconds) spent in each call of
this routine (including those called from it).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Sort alphabetically by subroutine names.</p>

<p>-d Reverse whatever sort is used</p>

<p>-A Count timing for autoloaded subroutine as timing for
*::AUTOLOAD. Otherwise the time to autoload it is counted as
time of the subroutine itself (there is no way to separate
autoload time from run time).</p>

<p>This is going to be irrelevant with newer Perls. They
will inform &quot;Devel::DProf&quot; when the
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; switches to actual subroutine, so a
separate statistics for &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; will be
collected no matter whether this option is set.</p>

<p>-R Count anonymous subroutines defined in the same
package separately.</p>

<p>-E (default) Display all subroutine times exclusive of
child subroutine times.</p>

<p>-F Force the generation of fake exit timestamps if
dprofpp reports that the profile is garbled. This is only
useful if dprofpp determines that the profile is garbled due
to missing exit timestamps. Youre on your own if you do
this. Consult the BUGS section.</p>

<p>-I Display all subroutine times inclusive of child
subroutine times.</p>

<p>-l Sort by number of calls to the subroutines. This may
help identify candidates for inlining.</p>

<p>-O cnt Show only cnt subroutines. The default is 15.</p>

<p>-p script Tells dprofpp that it should profile the given
script and then interpret its profile data. See -Q.</p>

<p>-Q Used with -p to tell dprofpp to quit after profiling
the script, without interpreting the data.</p>

<p>-q Do not display column headers.</p>

<p>-r Display elapsed real times rather than user+system
times.</p>

<p>-s Display system times rather than user+system
times.</p>

<p>-T Display subroutine call tree to stdout. Subroutine
statistics are not displayed.</p>

<p>-t Display subroutine call tree to stdout. Subroutine
statistics are not displayed. When a function is called
multiple consecutive times at the same calling level then it
is displayed once with a repeat count.</p>

<p>-S Display merged subroutine call tree to stdout.
Statistics are displayed for each branch of the tree.</p>

<p>When a function is called multiple (not necessarily
consecutive) times in the same branch then all these calls
go into one branch of the next level. A repeat count is
output together with combined inclusive, exclusive and kids
time.</p>

<p>Branches are sorted with regard to inclusive time.</p>

<p>-U Do not sort. Display in the order found in the raw
profile.</p>

<p>-u Display user times rather than user+system times.</p>

<p>-V Print dprofpp s version number and exit. If a raw
profile is found then its XS_VERSION variable will be
displayed, too.</p>

<p>-v Sort by average time spent in subroutines during each
call. This may help identify candidates for inlining.</p>

<p>-z (default) Sort by amount of user+system time used.
The first few lines should show you which subroutines are
using the most time.</p>

<p>-g &quot;subroutine&quot; Ignore subroutines except
&quot;subroutine&quot; and whatever is called from it.</p>

<p>-G &lt;regexp&gt; Aggregate &quot;Group&quot; all calls
matching the pattern together. For example this can be used
to group all calls of a set of packages</p>

<p>-G
&quot;(package1::)|(package2::)|(package3::)&quot;</p>

<p>or to group subroutines by name:</p>

<p>-G &quot;getNum&quot;</p>

<p>-P Used with -G to aggregate &quot;Pull&quot; together
all calls that did not match -G.</p>

<p>-f &lt;regexp&gt; Filter all calls matching the
pattern.</p>

<p>-h Display brief help and exit.</p>

<p>-H Display long help and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable DPROFPP_OPTS can be
set to a string containing options for dprofpp. You might
use this if you prefer -I over -E or if you want -F on all
the time.</p>

<p>This was added fairly lazily, so there are some
undesirable side effects. Options on the commandline should
override options in DPROFPP_OPTS--but dont count on that in
this version.</p>

<p>BUGS Applications which call _exit() or exec() from
within a subroutine will leave an incomplete profile. See
the -F option.</p>

<p>Any bugs in Devel::DProf, or any profiler generating the
profile data, could be visible here. See &quot;BUGS&quot; in
Devel::DProf.</p>

<p>Mail bug reports and feature requests to the
perl5-porters mailing list at
&lt;perl5-porters@perl.org&gt;. Bug reports should include
the output of the -V option.</p>
