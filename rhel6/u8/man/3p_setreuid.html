<p>SETREUID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETREUID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setreuid - set real and effective user IDs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setreuid() function shall set the real
and effective user IDs of the current process to the values
specified by the ruid and euid argu- ments. If ruid or euid
is -1, the corresponding effective or real user ID of the
current process shall be left unchanged.</p>

<p>A process with appropriate privileges can set either ID
to any value. An unprivileged process can only set the
effective user ID if the euid argument is equal to either
the real, effective, or saved user ID of the process.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether a process without appropriate
privileges is permitted to change the real user ID to match
the current real, effec- tive, or saved set-user-ID of the
process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setreuid() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the ruid or euid argument is invalid
or out-of- range.</p>

<p>EPERM The current process does not have appropriate
privileges, and either an attempt was made to change the
effective user ID to a value other than the real user ID or
the saved set-user-ID or an attempt was made to change the
real user ID to a value not per- mitted by the
implementation.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Setting the Effective User ID to the Real User
ID The following example sets the effective user ID of the
calling process to the real user ID, so that files created
later will be owned by the current user.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
... setreuid(getuid(), getuid()); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
