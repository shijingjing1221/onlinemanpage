Tk_MaintainGeometry(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_MaintainGeometry, Tk_UnmaintainGeometry -
maintain geometry of one window relative to another</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_MaintainGeometry(slave, master, x, y, width,
height)</p>

<p>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry(slave, master)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window slave (in) Window whose geometry is
to be con- trolled.</p>

<p>Tk_Window master (in) Window relative to which slaves
geome- try will be controlled.</p>

<p>int x (in) Desired x-coordinate of slave in master,
measured in pixels from the inside of masters left border to
the outside of slaves left border.</p>

<p>int y (in) Desired y-coordinate of slave in master,
measured in pixels from the inside of master s top border to
the outside of slaves top border.</p>

<p>int width (in) Desired width for slave, in pixels.</p>

<p>int height (in) Desired height for slave, in pixels.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_MaintainGeometry and
Tk_UnmaintainGeometry make it easier for geome- try managers
to deal with slaves whose masters are not their parents.
Three problems arise if the master for a slave is not its
parent:</p>

<p>[1] The x- and y-position of the slave must be
translated from the coordinate system of the master to that
of the parent before positioning the slave.</p>

<p>[2] If the master window, or any of its ancestors up to
the slaves parent, is moved, then the slave must be
repositioned within its parent in order to maintain the
correct position relative to the master.</p>

<p>[3] If the master or one of its ancestors is mapped or
unmapped, then the slave must be mapped or unmapped to
correspond.</p>

<p>None of these problems is an issue if the parent and
master are the same. For example, if the master or one of
its ancestors is unmapped, the slave is automatically
removed by the screen by X.</p>

<p>Tk_MaintainGeometry deals with these problems for slaves
whose masters are not their parents, as well as handling the
simpler case of slaves whose masters are their parents.
Tk_MaintainGeometry is typically called by a window manager
once it has decided where a slave should be positioned
relative to its master. Tk_MaintainGeometry translates the
coordinates to the coordinate system of slaves parent and
then moves and resizes the slave appropriately. Furthermore,
it remembers the desired position and creates event handlers
to monitor the master and all of its ancestors up to (but
not including) the slave s parent. If any of these windows
is moved, mapped, or unmapped, the slave will be adjusted so
that it is mapped only when the master is mapped and its
geometry relative to the master remains as specified by x,
y, width, and height.</p>

<p>When a window manager relinquishes control over a
window, or if it decides that it does not want the window to
appear on the screen under any conditions, it calls
Tk_UnmaintainGeometry. Tk_UnmaintainGeometry unmaps the
window and cancels any previous calls to Tk_MaintainGeometry
for the master-slave pair, so that the slaves geometry and
mapped state are no longer maintained automatically.
Tk_UnmaintainGeometry need not be called by a geometry
manager if the slave, the master, or any of the masters
ancestors is destroyed: Tk will call it automati- cally.</p>

<p>If Tk_MaintainGeometry is called repeatedly for the same
master-slave pair, the information from the most recent call
supersedes any older information. If Tk_UnmaintainGeometry
is called for a master-slave pair that is is not currently
managed, the call has no effect.</p>
