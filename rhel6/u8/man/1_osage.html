<p>NAME osage - filter for drawing clustered graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS osage [-(G|N|E)name=value] [-Tlang] [-llibfile]
[-ooutfile] [-O] [-P] [-v] [-V] [files]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION osage draws clustered graphs. As input, it
takes any graph in the dot format. It draws the graph
recursively. At each level, there will be a collection of
nodes and a collection of cluster subgraphs. The inter- nals
of each cluster subgraph are laid out, then the cluster
subgraphs and nodes at the current level are positioned
relative to each other, treating each cluster subgraph as a
node.</p>

<p>At each level, the nodes and cluster subgraphs are
viewed as rectangles to be packed together. At present,
edges are ignored during packing. Packing is done using the
standard packing functions. In particular, the graph
attributes pack and packmode control the layout. Each graph
and cluster can specify its own values for these attributes.
Remember also that a cluster inherits its attribute values
from its parent graph.</p>

<p>After all nodes and clusters, edges are routed based on
the value of the splines attribute.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMATS Osage uses an extensible plugin mechanism
for its output renderers, so to see what output formats your
installation of osage supports you can use osage -Txxx
(where xxx is an unlikely format) and check the warning
message. Also, The plugin mechanism supports multiple imple-
mentations of the output formats. To see what variants are
available, use, for example: osage -Tpng: and to force a
particular variant, use, for example: osage -Tpng:gd</p>

<p>Traditionally, osage supports the following: -Tps
(PostScript), -Tsvg -Tsvgz (Structured Vector Graphics),
-Tfig (XFIG graphics), -Tmif (FrameMaker graphics), -Thpgl
(HP pen plotters), and -Tpcl (Laserjet printers), -Tpng
-Tgif (bitmap graphics), -Tdia (GTK+ based diagrams), -Timap
(imagemap files for httpd servers for each node or edge that
has a non-null &quot;href&quot; attribute.), -Tcmapx
(client-side imagemap for use in html and xhtml). Additional
less common or more special-purpose output formats can be
found at http://www.graphviz.org/cvs/doc/info/out-
put.html.)</p>

<p>Alternative plugins providing support for a given output
format can be found from the error message resulting from
appending a : to the for- mat. e.g. -Tpng: The first plugin
listed is always the default.</p>

<p>GRAPH FILE LANGUAGE Here is a synopsis of the graph file
language, traditionally using the extension .gv or .dot, for
graphs:</p>

<p>[strict] (graph|digraph) name { statement-list } Is the
top level graph. If the graph is strict then multiple edges
are not allowed between the same pairs of nodes. If it is a
directed graph, indicated by digraph, then the edgeop must
be &quot;-&gt;&quot;. If it is an undirected graph then the
edgeop must be &quot;--&quot;. Statements may be:</p>

<p>name=val; node [name=val]; edge [name=val]; Set default
graph, node, or edge attribute name to val. Any subgraph,
node, or edge appearing after this inherits the new default
attributes.</p>

<p>n0 [name0=val0,name1=val1,...]; Creates node n0 (if it
does not already exist) and sets its attributes according to
the optional list.</p>

<p>n0 edgeop n1 edgeop ... edgeop nn
[name0=val0,name1=val1,...]; Creates edges between nodes n0,
n1, ..., nn and sets their attributes according to the
optional list. Creates nodes as necessary.</p>

<p>[subgraph name] { statement-list } Creates a subgraph.
Subgraphs may be used in place of n0, ..., nn in the above
statements to create edges. [subgraph name] is optional; if
missing, the subgraph is assigned an internal name.</p>

<p>Comments may be /*C-like*/ or //C++-like.</p>

<p>Attribute names and values are ordinary (C-style)
strings. The follow- ing sections describe attributes that
control graph layout.</p>

<p>GRAPH ATTRIBUTES size=&quot;x,y&quot; sets bounding box
of drawing in inches.</p>

<p>page=&quot;x,y&quot; sets the PostScript pagination
unit.</p>

<p>ratio=f sets the aspect ratio to f which may be a
floating point num- ber, or one of the keywords fill,
compress, or auto.</p>

<p>pagedir=[TBLR][TBLR] sets the major and minor order of
pagination.</p>

<p>rotate=90 sets landscape mode. (orientation=land is
backward compati- ble but obsolete.)</p>

<p>center=n a non-zero value centers the drawing on the
page.</p>

<p>layers=&quot;id:id:id:id&quot; is a sequence of layer
identifiers for overlay diagrams. The PostScript array
variable layercolorseq sets the assign- ment of colors to
layers. The least index is 1 and each element must be a
3-element array to be interpreted as a color coordinate.</p>

<p>color=colorvalue sets foreground color (bgcolor for
background).</p>

<p>href=&quot;url&quot; the default url for image map
files; in PostScript files, the base URL for all relative
URLs, as recognized by Acrobat Distiller 3.0 and up.</p>

<p>URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;href&quot;.)</p>

<p>stylesheet=&quot;file.css&quot; includes a reference to
a stylesheet in -Tsvg and -Tsvgz outputs. Ignored by other
formats.</p>

<p>splines. If set to true, edges are drawn as splines. If
set to poly- line, edges are drawn as polylines. If set to
ortho, edges are drawn as orthogonal polylines. In all of
these cases, the nodes may not overlap. If splines=false or
splines=line, edges are drawn as line segments. The default
is false.</p>

<p>NODE ATTRIBUTES height=d or width=d sets minimum height
or width. Adding fixed- size=true forces these to be the
actual size (text labels are ignored).</p>

<p>shape=record polygon epsf builtin_polygon
builtin_polygon is one of: plaintext ellipse oval circle egg
triangle box diamond trapezium parallelogram house hexagon
octagon note tab box3d component. (Polygons are defined or
modified by the following node attributes: regular,
peripheries, sides, orientation, distortion and skew.) epsf
uses the nodes shapefile attribute as the path name of an
external EPSF file to be automatically loaded for the node
shape.</p>

<p>label=text where text may include escaped newlines 0 r
for center, left, and right justified lines. The string alue
will be replaced by the node name. The string G value will
be replaced by the graph name. Record labels may contain
recursive box lists delim- ited by { | }. Port identifiers
in labels are set off by angle brack- ets &lt; &gt;. In the
graph file, use colon (such as, node0:port28).</p>

<p>fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.</p>

<p>fontname=name sets the label font family name.</p>

<p>color=colorvalue sets the outline color, and the default
fill color if style=filled and fillcolor is not
specified.</p>

<p>fillcolor=colorvalue sets the fill color when
style=filled. If not specified, the fillcolor when
style=filled defaults to be the same as the outline
color.</p>

<p>fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.</p>

<p>A colorvalue may be &quot;h,s,v&quot; (hue, saturation,
brightness) floating point numbers between 0 and 1, or an
X11 color name such as white black red green blue yellow
magenta cyan or burlywood, or a &quot;#rrggbb&quot; (red,
green, blue, 2 hex characters each) value.</p>

<p>style=filled solid dashed dotted bold invis or any
Postscript code.</p>

<p>layer=id or id:id or &quot;all&quot; sets the nodes
active layers. The empty string means no layers
(invisible).</p>

<p>The following attributes apply only to polygon shape
nodes:</p>

<p>regular=n if n is non-zero then the polygon is made
regular, i.e. sym- metric about the x and y axis, otherwise
the polygon takes on the aspect ratio of the label.
builtin_polygons that are not already regu- lar are made
regular by this attribute. builtin_polygons that are already
regular are not affected (i.e. they cannot be made asymmet-
ric).</p>

<p>peripheries=n sets the number of periphery lines drawn
around the poly- gon. This value supersedes the number of
periphery lines of builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>sides=n sets the number of sides to the polygon. n&lt;3
results in an ellipse. This attribute is ignored by
builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>orientation=f sets the orientation of the first apex of
the polygon counterclockwise from the vertical, in degrees.
f may be a floating point number. The orientation of labels
is not affected by this attribute. This attribute is added
to the initial orientation of builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>distortion=f sets the amount of broadening of the top
and narrowing of the bottom of the polygon (relative to its
orientation). Floating point values between -1 and +1 are
suggested. This attribute is ignored by
builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>skew=f sets the amount of right-displacement of the top
and left-dis- placement of the bottom of the polygon
(relative to its orientation). Floating point values between
-1 and +1 are suggested. This attribute is ignored by
builtin_polygons.</p>

<p>href=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the node in
imagemap, PostScript and SVG files. The substrings nd G are
substituted in the same manner as for the node label
attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted with the
node label string.</p>

<p>URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;href&quot;.)</p>

<p>target=&quot;target&quot; is a target string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when nodes have a
URL. The target string is used to deter- mine which window
of the browser is used for the URL. Setting it to
&quot;_graphviz&quot; will open a new window if it doesnt
already exist, or reuse it if it does. If the target string
is empty, the default, then no target attribute is included
in the output. The substrings nd G are substituted in the
same manner as for the node label attribute. Additionally
the substring s substituted with the node label string.</p>

<p>tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when nodes have a
URL. The tooltip string defaults to be the same as the label
string, but this attribute permits nodes with- out labels to
still have tooltips thus permitting denser graphs. The
substrings nd G are substituted in the same manner as for
the node label attribute. Additionally the substring s
substituted with the node label string.</p>

<p>EDGE ATTRIBUTES label=text where text may include
escaped newlines 0 r for centered, left, or right justified
lines. If the substring T is found in a label it will be
replaced by the tail_node name. If the substring s found in
a label it will be replaced by the head_node name. If the
substring value is found in a label it will be replaced by:
tail_node_name-&gt;head_node_name If the substring G is
found in a label it will be replaced by the graph name. or
by: tail_node_name--head_node_name for undirected
graphs.</p>

<p>fontsize=n sets the label type size to n points.</p>

<p>fontname=name sets the label font family name.</p>

<p>fontcolor=colorvalue sets the label text color.</p>

<p>style=solid dashed dotted bold invis</p>

<p>color=colorvalue sets the line color for edges.</p>

<p>color=colorvaluelist a : separated list of colorvalue
creates paral- lel edges, one edge for each color.</p>

<p>dir=forward back both none controls arrow direction.</p>

<p>tailclip,headclip=false disables endpoint shape
clipping.</p>

<p>href=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the node in
imagemap, PostScript and SVG files. The substrings T, and G
are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label
attribute. Additionally the sub- string s substituted with
the edge label string.</p>

<p>URL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;URL&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;href&quot;.)</p>

<p>target=&quot;target&quot; is a target string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when edges have a
URL. If the target string is empty, the default, then no
target attribute is included in the output. The substrings
T, and G are substituted in the same manner as for the edge
label attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted
with the edge label string.</p>

<p>tooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for
client-side imagemaps effec- tive when edges have a URL. The
tooltip string defaults to be the same as the edge label
string. The substrings T, and G are substituted in the same
manner as for the edge label attribute. Addi- tionally the
substring s substituted with the edge label string.</p>

<p>arrowhead,arrowtail=none, normal, inv, dot, odot,
invdot, invodot, tee, empty, invempty, open, halfopen,
diamond, odiamond, box, obox, crow.</p>

<p>arrowsize (norm_length=10,norm_width=5,
inv_length=6,inv_width=7,dot_radius=2)</p>

<p>headlabel,taillabel=string for port labels.
labelfontcolor,labelfont- name,labelfontsize for head and
tail labels. The substrings T, and G are substituted in the
same manner as for the edge label attribute. Additionally
the substring s substituted with the edge label string.</p>

<p>headhref=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the head port
in imagemap, PostScript and SVG files. The substrings T, and
G are substi- tuted in the same manner as for the edge label
attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted with the
edge label string.</p>

<p>headURL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;headURL&quot; is a
synonym for &quot;headhref&quot;.)</p>

<p>headtarget=&quot;headtarget&quot; is a target string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when edge heads
have a URL. The headtarget string is used to determine which
window of the browser is used for the URL. If the headtarget
string is empty, the default, then headtarget defaults to
the same value as target for the edge. The substrings T, and
G are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label
attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted with the
edge label string.</p>

<p>headtooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for
client-side imagemaps effective when head ports have a URL.
The tooltip string defaults to be the same as the headlabel
string. The substrings T, and are substituted in the same
manner as for the edge label attribute. Additionally the
substring s substituted with the edge label string.</p>

<p>tailhref=&quot;url&quot; sets the url for the tail port

edge label string.</p>

<p>tailURL=&quot;url&quot; (&quot;tailURL&quot; is a
synonym for &quot;tailhref&quot;.)</p>

<p>tailtarget=&quot;tailtarget&quot; is a target string for
client-side imagemaps and SVG, effective when edge tails
have a URL. The tailtarget string is used to determine which
window of the browser is used for the URL. If the tailtarget
string is empty, the default, then tailtarget defaults to
the same value as target for the edge. The substrings T, and
G are substituted in the same manner as for the edge label
attribute. Additionally the substring s substituted with the
edge label string.</p>

<p>tailtooltip=&quot;tooltip&quot; is a tooltip string for

manner as for the edge label attribute. Additionally the
substring s substituted with the edge label string.</p>

<p>labeldistance and port_label_distance set distance; also
labelangle (in degrees CCW)</p>

<p>samehead,sametail aim edges having the same value to the
same port, using the average landing point.</p>

<p>layer=id or id:id or &quot;all&quot; sets the edges
active layers. The empty string means no layers
(invisible).</p>
