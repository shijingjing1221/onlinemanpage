<p>SNMP.CONF(5) Net-SNMP SNMP.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME snmp.conf - configuration files for the Net-SNMP
applications</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Applications built using the Net-SNMP
libraries typically use one or more configuration files to
control various aspects of their operation. These files
(snmp.conf and snmp.local.conf) can be located in one of
several locations, as described in the snmp_config(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>In particular, /etc/snmp/snmp.conf is a common file,
containing the settings shared by all users of the system.
~/.snmp/snmp.conf is a personal file, with the settings
specific to a particular user.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE Several of these directives may contain
sensitive information (such as pass phrases). Configuration
files that include such settings should only be readable by
the user concerned.</p>

<p>As well as application-specific configuration tokens,
there are several directives that relate to standard library
behaviour, relevant to most Net-SNMP applications. Many of
these correspond to standard command- line options, which
are described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.</p>

<p>These directives can be divided into several distinct
groups.</p>

<p>CLIENT BEHAVIOUR defDomain application domain The
transport domain that should be used for a certain applica-
tion type unless something else is specified.</p>

<p>defTarget application domain target The target that
should be used for connections to a certain application if
the connection should be in a specific domain.</p>

<p>defaultPort PORT defines the default UDP port that
client SNMP applications will attempt to connect to. This
can be overridden by explicitly including a port number in
the AGENT specification. See the snmpcmd(1) manual page for
more details.</p>

<p>If not specified, the default value for this token is
161.</p>

<p>defVersion (1|2c|3) defines the default version of SNMP
to use. This can be over- ridden using the -v option.</p>

<p>defCommunity STRING defines the default community to use
for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c requests. This can be overridden
using the -c option.</p>

<p>alias NAME DEFINITION Creates an aliased tied to NAME
for a given transport defini- tion. The alias can the be
referred to using an alias: prefix. Eg, a line of
&quot;alias here udp:127.0.0.1:6161&quot; would allow you to
use a destination host of &quot;alias:here&quot; instead of
&quot;udp:127.0.0.1:6161&quot;. This becomes more useful
with complex transport addresses involving IPv6 addresses,
etc.</p>

<p>dumpPacket yes defines whether to display a hexadecimal
dump of the raw SNMP requests sent and received by the
application. This is equiva- lent to the -d option.</p>

<p>doDebugging (1|0) turns on debugging for all
applications run if set to 1.</p>

<p>debugTokens TOKEN[,TOKEN...] defines the debugging
tokens that should be turned on when doDe- bugging is set.
This is equivalent to the -D option.</p>

<p>16bitIDs yes restricts requestIDs, etc to 16-bit
values.</p>

<p>The SNMP specifications define these ID fields as 32-bit
quanti- ties, and the Net-SNMP library typically initialises
them to random values for security. However certain (broken)
agents cannot handle ID values greater than 2^16 - this
option allows interoperability with such agents.</p>

<p>clientaddr
[&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;
specifies the source address to be used by command-line
applica- tions when sending SNMP requests. See snmpcmd(1)
for more infor- mation about the format of addresses.</p>

<p>This value is also used by snmpd when generating
notifications.</p>

<p>clientaddrUsesPort no specifies, if clientaddr option
contains a port number. Set this option to &quot;yes&quot;,
if clientaddr contains a port number and this port should be
used for sending outgoing SNMP requests.</p>

<p>clientRecvBuf INTEGER specifies the desired size of the
buffer to be used when receiv- ing responses to SNMP
requests. If the OS hard limit is lower than the
clientRecvBuf value, then this will be used instead. Some
platforms may decide to increase the size of the buffer
actually used for internal housekeeping.</p>

<p>This directive will be ignored if the platforms does not
support setsockopt().</p>

<p>clientSendBuf INTEGER is similar to clientRecvBuf, but
applies to the size of the buffer used when sending SNMP
requests.</p>

<p>noRangeCheck yes disables the validation of varbind
values against the MIB defi- nition for the relevant OID.
This is equivalent to the -Ir option.</p>

<p>This directive is primarily relevant to the snmpset
command, but will also apply to any application that calls
snmp_add_var() with a non-NULL value.</p>

<p>noTokenWarnings disables warnings about unknown config
file tokens.</p>

<p>reverseEncodeBER (1|yes|true|0|no|false) controls how
the encoding of SNMP requests is handled.</p>

<p>The default behaviour is to encode packets starting from
the end of the PDU and working backwards. This directive can
be used to disable this behaviour, and build the encoded
request in the (more obvious) forward direction.</p>

<p>It should not normally be necessary to change this
setting, as the encoding is basically the same in either
case - but working backwards typically produces a slightly
more efficient encoding, and hence a smaller network
datagram.</p>

<p>SNMPv3 SETTINGS defSecurityName STRING defines the
default security name to use for SNMPv3 requests. This can
be overridden using the -u option.</p>

<p>defSecurityLevel noAuthNoPriv|authNoPriv|authPriv
defines the default security level to use for SNMPv3
requests. This can be overridden using the -l option.</p>

<p>If not specified, the default value for this token is
noAuthNo- Priv.</p>

<p>Note: authPriv is only available if the software has
been com- piled to use the OpenSSL libraries.</p>

<p>defPassphrase STRING</p>

<p>defAuthPassphrase STRING</p>

<p>defPrivPassphrase STRING define the default
authentication and privacy pass phrases to use for SNMPv3
requests. These can be overridden using the -A and -X
options respectively.</p>

<p>The defPassphrase value will be used for the
authentication and/or privacy pass phrases if either of the
other directives are not specified.</p>

<p>defAuthType MD5|SHA</p>

<p>defPrivType DES|AES define the default authentication
and privacy protocols to use for SNMPv3 requests. These can
be overridden using the -a and -x options respectively.</p>

<p>If not specified, SNMPv3 requests will default to MD5
authenti- cation and DES encryption.</p>

<p>Note: If the software has not been compiled to use the
OpenSSL libraries, then only MD5 authentication is
supported. Neither SHA authentication nor any form of
encryption will be available.</p>

<p>defContext STRING defines the default context to use for
SNMPv3 requests. This can be overridden using the -n
option.</p>

<p>If not specified, the default value for this token is
the default context (i.e. the empty string
&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>defSecurityModel STRING defines the security model to
use for SNMPv3 requests. The default value is
&quot;usm&quot; which is the only widely used security model
for SNMPv3.</p>

<p>defAuthMasterKey 0xHEXSTRING</p>

<p>defPrivMasterKey 0xHEXSTRING</p>

<p>defAuthLocalizedKey 0xHEXSTRING</p>

<p>defPrivLocalizedKey 0xHEXSTRING define the (hexadecimal)
keys to be used for SNMPv3 secure com- munications. SNMPv3
keys are frequently derived from a passphrase, as discussed
in the defPassphrase section above. However for improved
security a truely random key can be gener- ated and used
instead (which would normally has better entropy than a
password unless it is amazingly long). The directives are
equivalent to the short-form command line options -3m, -3M,
-3k, and -3K.</p>

<p>Localized keys are master keys which have been converted
to a unique key which is only suitable for on particular
SNMP engine (agent). The length of the key needs to be
appropriate for the authentication or encryption type being
used (auth keys: MD5=16 bytes, SHA1=20 bytes; priv keys:
DES=16 bytes (8 bytes of which is used as an IV and not a
key), and AES=16 bytes).</p>

<p>sshtosnmpsocketperms PATH Sets the path of the sshtosnmp
socket created by an application (e.g. snmpd) listening for
incoming ssh connections through the sshtosnmp unix
socket.</p>

<p>sshtosnmpsocketperms MODE [OWNER [GROUP]] Sets the mode,
owner and group of the sshtosnmp socket created by an
application (e.g. snmpd) listening for incoming ssh con-
nections through the sshtosnmp unix socket. The socket needs
to be read/write privileged for SSH users that are allowed
to con- nect to the SNMP service (VACM access still needs to
be granted as well, most likely through the TSM security
model).</p>

<p>SERVER BEHAVIOUR persistentDir DIRECTORY defines the
directory where snmpd and snmptrapd store persistent
configuration settings.</p>

<p>If not specified, the persistent directory defaults to
/var/lib/net-snmp</p>

<p>noPersistentLoad yes</p>

<p>noPersistentSave yes disable the loading and saving of
persistent configuration information.</p>

<p>Note: This will break SNMPv3 operations (and other
behaviour that relies on changes persisting across
application restart). Use With Care.</p>

<p>tempFilePattern PATTERN defines a filename template for
creating temporary files, for handling input to and output
from external shell commands. Used by the mkstemp() and
mktemp() functions.</p>

<p>If not specified, the default pattern is
&quot;/var/run/net- snmp/snmp-tmp-XXXXXX&quot;.</p>

<p>serverRecvBuf INTEGER specifies the desired size of the
buffer to be used when receiv- ing incoming SNMP requests.
If the OS hard limit is lower than the serverRecvBuf value,
then this will be used instead. Some platforms may decide to
increase the size of the buffer actually used for internal
housekeeping.</p>

<p>This directive will be ignored if the platforms does not
support setsockopt().</p>

<p>serverSendBuf INTEGER is similar to serverRecvBuf, but
applies to the size of the buffer used when sending SNMP
responses.</p>

<p>MIB HANDLING mibdirs DIRLIST specifies a list of
directories to search for MIB files. This operates in the
same way as the -M option - see snmpcmd(1) for details. Note
that this value can be overridden by the MIBDIRS environment
variable, and the -M option.</p>

<p>mibs MIBLIST specifies a list of MIB modules (not files)
that should be loaded. This operates in the same way as the
-m option - see snmpcmd(1) for details. Note that this list
can be overridden by the MIBS environment variable, and the
-m option.</p>

<p>mibfile FILE specifies a (single) MIB file to load, in
addition to the list read from the mibs token (or equivalent
configuration). Note that this value can be overridden by
the MIBFILES environment variable.</p>

<p>showMibErrors (1|yes|true|0|no|false) whether to display
MIB parsing errors.</p>

<p>commentToEOL (1|yes|true|0|no|false) whether MIB parsing
should be strict about comment termination. Many MIB writers
assume that ASN.1 comments extend to the end of the text
line, rather than being terminated by the next
&quot;--&quot; token. This token can be used to accept such
(strictly incor- rect) MIBs. Note that this directive was
previous (mis-)named strictComment- Term, but with the
reverse behaviour from that implied by the name. This
earlier token is still accepted for backwards com-
patibility.</p>

<p>mibAllowUnderline (1|yes|true|0|no|false) whether to
allow underline characters in MIB object names and
enumeration values. This token can be used to accept such
(strictly incorrect) MIBs.</p>

<p>mibWarningLevel INTEGER the minimum warning level of the
warnings printed by the MIB parser.</p>

<p>OUTPUT CONFIGURATION logTimestamp
(1|yes|true|0|no|false) Whether the commands should log
timestamps with their error/mes- sage logging or not. Note
that output will not look as pretty with timestamps if the
source code that is doing the logging does incremental
logging of messages that are not line buffered before being
passed to the logging routines. This option is only used
when file logging is active.</p>

<p>printNumericEnums (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-Oe.</p>

<p>printNumericOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-On.</p>

<p>dontBreakdownOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-Ob.</p>

<p>escapeQuotes (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-OE.</p>

<p>quickPrinting (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-Oq.</p>

<p>printValueOnly (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-Ov.</p>

<p>dontPrintUnits (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-OU.</p>

<p>numericTimeticks (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-Ot.</p>

<p>printHexText (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-OT.</p>

<p>hexOutputLength integer Specifies where to break up the
output of hexadecimal strings. Set to 0 to disable line
breaks. Defaults to 16.</p>

<p>suffixPrinting (0|1|2) The value 1 is equivalent to -Os
and the value 2 is equivalent to -OS.</p>

<p>oidOutputFormat (1|2|3|4|5|6) Maps -O options as follow:
-Os=1, -OS=2, -Of=3, -On=4, -Ou=5. The value 6 has no
matching -O option. It suppresses output.</p>

<p>extendedIndex (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Equivalent to
-OX.</p>

<p>noDisplayHint (1|yes|true|0|no|false) Disables the use
of DISPLAY-HINT information when parsing indices and values
to set. Equivalent to -Ih.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/snmp/snmp.conf, /etc/snmp/snmp.local.conf -
common configuration settings ~/.snmp/snmp.conf -
user-specific configuration settings</p>
