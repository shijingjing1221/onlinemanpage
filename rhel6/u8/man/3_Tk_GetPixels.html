<p>Tk_GetPixelsFromObj(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_GetPixelsFromObj(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_GetPixelsFromObj, Tk_GetPixels, Tk_GetMMFromObj,
Tk_GetScreenMM - translate between strings and screen
units</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_GetPixelsFromObj(interp, tkwin, objPtr,
intPtr)</p>

<p>int Tk_GetPixels(interp, tkwin, string, intPtr)</p>

<p>int Tk_GetMMFromObj(interp, tkwin, objPtr,
doublePtr)</p>

<p>int Tk_GetScreenMM(interp, tkwin, string, doublePtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use for
error report- ing.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Window whose screen geometry deter-
mines the conversion between absolute units and pixels.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in/out) String value specifies a
distance on the screen; internal rep will be mod- ified to
cache converted distance.</p>

<p>const char *string (in) Same as objPtr except
specification of distance is passed as a string.</p>

<p>int *intPtr (out) Pointer to location in which to store
converted distance in pixels.</p>

<p>double *doublePtr (out) Pointer to location in which to
store converted distance in millimeters.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures take as argument a
specification of distance on the screen (objPtr or string)
and compute the corresponding distance either in integer
pixels or floating-point millimeters. In either case, objPtr
or string specifies a screen distance as a floating-point
number followed by one of the following characters that
indicates units:</p>

<p>&lt;none&gt; The number specifies a distance in
pixels.</p>

<p>c The number specifies a distance in centimeters on the
screen.</p>

<p>i The number specifies a distance in inches on the
screen.</p>

<p>m The number specifies a distance in millimeters on the
screen.</p>

<p>p The number specifies a distance in printers points
(1/72 inch) on the screen.</p>

<p>Tk_GetPixelsFromObj converts the value of objPtr to the
nearest even number of pixels and stores that value at
*intPtr. It returns TCL_OK under normal circumstances. If an
error occurs (e.g. objPtr contains a number followed by a
character that is not one of the ones above) then TCL_ERROR
is returned and an error message is left in interps result
if interp is not NULL. Tk_GetPixelsFromObj caches
information about the return value in objPtr, which speeds
up future calls to Tk_GetPix- elsFromObj with the same
objPtr.</p>

<p>Tk_GetPixels is identical to Tk_GetPixelsFromObj except
that the screen distance is specified with a string instead
of an object. This pre- vents Tk_GetPixels from caching the
return value, so Tk_GetAnchor is less efficient than
Tk_GetPixelsFromObj.</p>

<p>Tk_GetMMFromObj and Tk_GetScreenMM are similar to
Tk_GetPixelsFromObj and Tk_GetPixels (respectively) except
that they convert the screen distance to millimeters and
store a double-precision floating-point result at
*doublePtr.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS centimeters, convert, inches, millimeters,
pixels, points, screen units</p>
