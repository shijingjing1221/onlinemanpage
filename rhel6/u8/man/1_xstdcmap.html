<p>NAME xstdcmap - X standard colormap utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xstdcmap [-all] [-best] [-blue] [-default]
[-delete map] [-display dis- play] [-gray] [-green] [-help]
[-red] [-verbose] [-version]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xstdcmap utility can be used to
selectively define standard col- ormap properties. It is
intended to be run from a users X startup script to create
standard colormap definitions in order to facilitate sharing
of scarce colormap resources among clients. Where at all
pos- sible, colormaps are created with read-only
allocations.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options may be used with
xstdcmap:</p>

<p>-all This option indicates that all six standard
colormap properties should be defined on each screen of the
display. Not all screens will support visuals under which
all six standard col- ormap properties are meaningful.
xstdcmap will determine the best allocations and visuals for
the colormap properties of a screen. Any previously existing
standard colormap properties will be replaced.</p>

<p>-best This option indicates that the RGB_BEST_MAP should
be defined.</p>

<p>-blue This option indicates that the RGB_BLUE_MAP should
be defined.</p>

<p>-default This option indicates that the RGB_DEFAULT_MAP
should be defined.</p>

<p>-delete map This option specifies that a specific
standard colormap prop- erty, or all such properties, should
be removed. map may be one of: default, best, red, green,
blue, gray, or all.</p>

<p>-display display This option specifies the host and
display to use; see X(7).</p>

<p>-gray This option indicates that the RGB_GRAY_MAP should
be defined.</p>

<p>-green This option indicates that the RGB_GREEN_MAP
should be defined.</p>

<p>-help This option indicates that a brief description of
the command line arguments should be printed on the standard
error. This will be done whenever an unhandled argument is
given to xstd- cmap.</p>

<p>-red This option indicates that the RGB_RED_MAP should
be defined.</p>

<p>-verbose This option indicates that xstdcmap should
print logging infor- mation as it parses its input and
defines the standard colormap properties.</p>

<p>-version This option indicates that xstdcmap should
print its version and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY to get default host and display
number.</p>
