<p>SG_SCAN(8) SG3_UTILS SG_SCAN(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_scan - does a scan of sg devices (or given
SCSI/ATAPI/ATA devices) and prints the results</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_scan [-a] [-i] [-n] [-w] [-x] [DEVICE]*</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If no DEVICE names are given, sg_scan does a
scan of the sg devices and outputs a line of information for
each sg device that is currently bound to a SCSI device. If
one or more DEVICEs are given only those devices are
scanned. Each device is opened with the O_NONBLOCK flag so
that the scan will not &quot;hang&quot; on any device that
another process holds an O_EXCL lock on.</p>

<p>Any given DEVICE name is expected to comply with (to
some extent) the Storage Architecture Model (SAM see
www.t10.org). Any device names associated with the Linux
SCSI subsystem (e.g. /dev/sda and /dev/st0m) are suitable.
Devices names associated with ATAPI devices (e.g. most
CD/DVD drives and ATAPI tape drives) are also suitable. If
the device does not fall into the above categories then an
ATA IDENTIFY command is tried.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a do alphabetical scan (i.e. sga, sgb, sgc).
Note that sg device nodes with an alphabetical index have
been deprecated since the linux kernel 2.2 series.</p>

<p>-i do a SCSI INQUIRY, output results in a second
(indented) line. If the device is an ATA disk then output
information from an ATA IDENTIFY command</p>

<p>-n do numeric scan (i.e. sg0, sg1...) [default]</p>

<p>-w use a read/write flag when opening sg device (default
is read-only)</p>

<p>-x extra information output about queuing</p>

<p>NOTES This utility was written at a time when
hotplugging of SCSI devices was not supported in Linux. It
used a simple algorithm to scan sg device nodes in ascending
numeric or alphabetical order, stopping after there were 4
consecutive errors.</p>

<p>In the linux kernel 2.6 series, this utility uses sysfs
to find which sg device nodes are active and only checks
those. Hence there can be large &quot;holes&quot; in the
numbering of sg device nodes (e.g. after an adapter has been
removed) and still all active sg device nodes will be
listed. This utility assumes that sg device nodes are named
using the normal conventions and searches from /dev/sg0 to
/dev/sg4095 inclusive.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_scan is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
