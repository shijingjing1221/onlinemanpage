<p>MKTEMP(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MKTEMP(3)</p>

<p>NAME mktemp - make a unique temporary filename</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *mktemp(char *template);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>mktemp(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
&gt;= 500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mktemp() function generates a unique
temporary filename from tem- plate. The last six characters
of template must be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a
string that makes the filename unique. Since it will be
modified, template must not be a string constant, but should
be declared as a character array.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mktemp() function always returns
template. If a unique name was created, the last six bytes
of template will have been modified in such a way that the
resulting name is unique (i.e., does not exist already) If a
unique name could not be created, template is made an empty
string.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL The last six characters of template were
not XXXXXX.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX.1-2008 removes
the specification of mktemp().</p>

<p>NOTES The prototype is in &lt;unistd.h&gt; for libc4,
libc5, glibc1; glibc2 follows the Single Unix Specification
and has the prototype in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS Never use mktemp(). Some implementations follow
4.3BSD and replace XXXXXX by the current process ID and a
single letter, so that at most 26 different names can be
returned. Since on the one hand the names are easy to guess,
and on the other hand there is a race between test- ing
whether the name exists and opening the file, every use of
mktemp() is a security risk. The race is avoided by
mkstemp(3).</p>
