<p>SUMMARY ab is a tool for benchmarking your Apache
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. It is designed to
give you an impression of how your current Apache
installation performs. This especially shows you how many
requests per second your Apache installation is capable of
serv- ing.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A auth-username:password Supply BASIC
Authentication credentials to the server. The user- name and
password are separated by a single : and sent on the wire
base64 encoded. The string is sent regardless of whether the
server needs it (i.e., has sent an 401 authentication
needed).</p>

<p>-b windowsize Size of TCP send/receive buffer, in
bytes.</p>

<p>-c concurrency Number of multiple requests to perform at
a time. Default is one request at a time.</p>

<p>-C cookie-name=value Add a Cookie: line to the request.
The argument is typically in the form of a name=value pair.
This field is repeatable.</p>

<p>-d Do not display the &quot;percentage served within XX
[ms] table&quot;. (legacy support).</p>

<p>-e csv-file Write a Comma separated value (CSV) file
which contains for each percentage (from 1% to 100%) the
time (in milliseconds) it took to serve that percentage of
the requests. This is usually more useful than the gnuplot
file; as the results are already binned.</p>

<p>-f protocol Specify SSL/TLS protocol (SSL2, SSL3, TLS1,
or ALL).</p>

<p>-g gnuplot-file Write all measured values out as a
gnuplot or TSV (Tab sepa- rate values) file. This file can
easily be imported into pack- ages like Gnuplot, IDL,
Mathematica, Igor or even Excel. The labels are on the first
line of the file.</p>

<p>-h Display usage information.</p>

<p>-H custom-header Append extra headers to the request.
The argument is typically in the form of a valid header
line, containing a colon-separated field-value pair (i.e.,
&quot;Accept-Encoding: zip/zop;8bit&quot;).</p>

<p>-i Do HEAD requests instead of GET.</p>

<p>-k Enable the HTTP KeepAlive feature, i.e., perform
multiple requests within one HTTP session. Default is no
KeepAlive.</p>

<p>-n requests Number of requests to perform for the
benchmarking session. The default is to just perform a
single request which usually leads to non-representative
benchmarking results.</p>

<p>-p POST-file File containing data to POST. Remember to
also set -T.</p>

<p>-P proxy-auth-username:password Supply BASIC
Authentication credentials to a proxy en-route. The username
and password are separated by a single : and sent on the
wire base64 encoded. The string is sent regardless of
whether the proxy needs it (i.e., has sent an 407 proxy
authen- tication needed).</p>

<p>-q When processing more than 150 requests, ab outputs a
progress count on stderr every 10% or 100 requests or so.
The -q flag will suppress these messages.</p>

<p>-r Dont exit on socket receive errors.</p>

<p>-s When compiled in (ab -h will show you) use the SSL
protected https rather than the http protocol. This feature
is experimen- tal and very rudimentary. You probably do not
want to use it.</p>

<p>-S Do not display the median and standard deviation
values, nor display the warning/error messages when the
average and median are more than one or two times the
standard deviation apart. And default to the min/avg/max
values. (legacy support).</p>

<p>-t timelimit Maximum number of seconds to spend for
benchmarking. This implies a -n 50000 internally. Use this
to benchmark the server within a fixed total amount of time.
Per default there is no timelimit.</p>

<p>-T content-type Content-type header to use for POST/PUT
data, eg. application/x- www-form-urlencoded. Default:
text/plain.</p>

<p>-u PUT-file File containing data to PUT. Remember to
also set -T.</p>

<p>-v verbosity Set verbosity level - 4 and above prints
information on headers, 3 and above prints response codes
(404, 200, etc.), 2 and above prints warnings and info.</p>

<p>-V Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-w Print out results in HTML tables. Default table is
two columns wide, with a white background.</p>

<p>-x &lt;table&gt;-attributes String to use as attributes
for &lt;table&gt;. Attributes are inserted &lt;table here
&gt;.</p>

<p>-X proxy[:port] Use a proxy server for the requests.</p>

<p>-y &lt;tr&gt;-attributes String to use as attributes for
&lt;tr&gt;.</p>

<p>-z &lt;td&gt;-attributes String to use as attributes for
&lt;td&gt;.</p>

<p>-Z ciphersuite Specify SSL/TLS cipher suite (See openssl
ciphers).</p>

<p>BUGS There are various statically declared buffers of
fixed length. Combined with the lazy parsing of the command
line arguments, the response head- ers from the server and
other external inputs, this might bite you.</p>

<p>It does not implement HTTP/1.x fully; only accepts some
expected forms of responses. The rather heavy use of
strstr(3) shows up top in profile, which might indicate a
performance problem; i.e., you would measure the ab
performance rather than the servers.</p>
