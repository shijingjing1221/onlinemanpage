<p>NAME hosts - The static table lookup for hostnames</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/hosts</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the format of the
/etc/hosts file. This file is a simple text file that
associates IP addresses with hostnames, one line per IP
address. For each host a single line should be present with
the following information:</p>

<p>IP_address canonical_hostname [aliases...]</p>

<p>Fields of the entry are separated by any number of
blanks and/or tab characters. Text from a &quot;#&quot;
character until the end of the line is a comment, and is
ignored. Host names may contain only alphanumeric
characters, minus signs (&quot;-&quot;), and periods
(&quot;.&quot;). They must begin with an alphabetic
character and end with an alphanumeric character. Optional
aliases provide for name changes, alternate spellings,
shorter hostnames, or generic hostnames (for example,
localhost).</p>

<p>The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) Server
implements the Internet name server for Unix systems. It
augments or replaces the /etc/hosts file or hostname lookup,
and frees a host from relying on /etc/hosts being up to date
and complete.</p>

<p>In modern systems, even though the host table has been
superseded by DNS, it is still widely used for:</p>

<p>bootstrapping Most systems have a small host table
containing the name and address information for important
hosts on the local network. This is useful when DNS is not
running, for example during sys- tem bootup.</p>

<p>NIS Sites that use NIS use the host table as input to
the NIS host database. Even though NIS can be used with DNS,
most NIS sites still use the host table with an entry for
all local hosts as a backup.</p>

<p>isolated nodes Very small sites that are isolated from
the network use the host table instead of DNS. If the local
information rarely changes, and the network is not connected
to the Internet, DNS offers little advantage.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts</p>

<p>NOTES Modifications to this file normally take effect
immediately, except in cases where the file is cached by
applications.</p>

<p>Historical Notes RFC 952 gave the original format for
the host table, though it has since changed.</p>

<p>Before the advent of DNS, the host table was the only
way of resolving hostnames on the fledgling Internet.
Indeed, this file could be cre- ated from the official host
data base maintained at the Network Infor- mation Control
Center (NIC), though local changes were often required to
bring it up to date regarding unofficial aliases and/or
unknown hosts. The NIC no longer maintains the hosts.txt
files, though looking around at the time of writing (circa
2000), there are historical hosts.txt files on the WWW. I
just found three, from 92, 94, and 95.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 127.0.0.1 localhost 192.168.1.10
foo.mydomain.org foo 192.168.1.13 bar.mydomain.org bar
146.82.138.7 master.debian.org master 209.237.226.90
