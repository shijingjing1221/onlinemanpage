<p>The PNM Format(5) The PNM Format(5)</p>

<p>NAME pnm - Netpbm superformat</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The PNM format is just an abstraction of the
PBM, PGM, and PPM formats. I.e. the name PNM refers
collectively to PBM, PGM, and PPM.</p>

<p>The name PNM is an acronym derived from Portable Any
Map. This derivation makes more sense if you consider it in
the context of the other Netpbm format names: PBM, PGM, and
PPM.</p>

<p>The more general term Netpbm format refers to the PNM
formats plus PAM.</p>

<p>PNM is principally used with Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>Note that besides being names of formats, PBM, PGM, PPM,
and PNM are also classes of programs. A PNM program can take
PBM, PGM, or PPM input. That s nothing special -- a PPM
program can too. But a PNM program can often produce
multiple output formats as well, and a PNM program can see
the difference between PBM, PGM, and PPM input and respond
to each differently whereas a PPM program sees everything as
if it were PPM. This is discussed more in the description of
the netpbm programs (1).</p>

<p>pnm also appears in the names of the most general
Netpbmlibraryrou- tines(1),someofwhicharenteven related to
the PNM format.</p>
