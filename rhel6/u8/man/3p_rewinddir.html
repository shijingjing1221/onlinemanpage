<p>REWINDDIR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
REWINDDIR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME rewinddir - reset the position of a directory
stream to the beginning of a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;</p>

<p>void rewinddir(DIR *dirp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rewinddir() function shall reset the
position of the directory stream to which dirp refers to the
beginning of the directory. It shall also cause the
directory stream to refer to the current state of the
corresponding directory, as a call to opendir() would have
done. If dirp does not refer to a directory stream, the
effect is undefined.</p>

<p>After a call to the fork() function, either the parent
or child (but not both) may continue processing the
directory stream using readdir(), rewinddir(), or seekdir().
If both the parent and child processes use these functions,
the result is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The rewinddir() function shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The rewinddir() function should be
used in conjunction with opendir(), readdir(), and
closedir() to examine the contents of the directory. This
method is recommended for portability.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;dirent.h&gt;
