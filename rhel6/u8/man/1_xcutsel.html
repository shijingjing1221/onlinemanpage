<p>XCUTSEL(1) XCUTSEL(1)</p>

<p>NAME xcutsel - interchange between cut buffer and
selection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xcutsel [ -toolkitoption ...] [-selection
selection] [-cutbuffer num- ber]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xcutsel program is used to copy the
current selection into a cut buffer and to make a selection
that contains the current contents of the cut buffer. It
acts as a bridge between applications that dont support
selections and those that do.</p>

<p>By default, xcutsel will use the selection named PRIMARY
and the cut buffer CUT_BUFFER0. Either or both of these can
be overridden by com- mand line arguments or by
resources.</p>

<p>An xcutsel window has the following buttons:</p>

<p>quit When this button is pressed, xcutsel exits. Any
selections held by xcutsel are automatically released.</p>

<p>copy PRIMARY to 0 When this button is pressed, xcutsel
copies the current selec- tion into the cut buffer.</p>

<p>copy 0 to PRIMARY When this button is pressed, xcutsel
converts the current con- tents of the cut buffer into the
selection.</p>

<p>The button labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer
selected by com- mand line options or through the resource
database.</p>

<p>When the copy 0 to PRIMARY button is activated, the
button will remain inverted as long as xcutsel remains the
owner of the selection. This serves to remind you which
client owns the current selection. Note that the value of
the selection remains constant; if the cutbuffer is changed,
you must again activate the copy button to retrieve the new
value when desired.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xcutsel accepts all of the standard X Toolkit
command line options as well as the following:</p>

<p>-selection name This option specifies the name of the
selection to use. The default is PRIMARY. The only supported
abbreviations for this option are -select, -sel and -s , as
the standard toolkit option -selectionTimeout has a similar
name.</p>

<p>-cutbuffer number This option specifies the cut buffer
to use. The default is cut buffer 0.</p>

<p>X DEFAULTS This program accepts all of the standard X
Toolkit resource names and classes as well as:</p>

<p>selection (class Selection) This resource specifies the
name of the selection to use. The default is PRIMARY.</p>

<p>cutBuffer (class CutBuffer) This resource specifies the
number of the cut buffer to use. The default is 0.</p>

<p>WIDGET NAMES The following instance names may be used
when user configuration of the labels in them is
desired:</p>

<p>sel-cut (class Command) This is the copy SELECTION to
BUFFER button.</p>

<p>cut-sel (class Command) This is the copy BUFFER to
SELECTION button.</p>

<p>quit (class Command) This is the quit button.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO X(7), xclipboard(1), xterm(1), text widget
documentation, individual client documentation for how to
make a selection.</p>

<p>BUGS There is no way to change the name of the selection
or the number of the cut buffer while the program is
running.</p>
