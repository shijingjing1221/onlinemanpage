<p>MQ_NOTIFY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MQ_NOTIFY(3)</p>

<p>NAME mq_notify - register for notification when a
message is available</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>mqd_t mq_notify(mqd_t mqdes, const struct sigevent
*notification);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mq_notify() allows the calling process to
register or unregister for delivery of an asynchronous
notification when a new message arrives on the empty message
queue referred to by the descriptor mqdes.</p>

<p>The notification argument is a pointer to a sigevent
structure that is defined something like the following:</p>

<p>union sigval { /* Data passed with notification */ int
sival_int; /* Integer value */ void *sival_ptr; /* Pointer
value */ };</p>

<p>struct sigevent { int sigev_notify; /* Notification
method */ int sigev_signo; /* Notification signal */ union
sigval sigev_value; /* Data passed with notification */ void
(*sigev_notify_function) (union sigval); /* Function for
thread notification */ void *sigev_notify_attributes; /*
Thread function attributes */ };</p>

<p>If notification is a non-NULL pointer, then mq_notify()
registers the calling process to receive message
notification. The sigev_notify field of the sigevent to
which notification points specifies how noti- fication is to
be performed. This field has one of the following val-
ues:</p>

<p>SIGEV_NONE A &quot;null&quot; notification: the calling
process is registered as the target for notification, but
when a message arrives, no notifi- cation is sent.</p>

<p>SIGEV_SIGNAL Notify the process by sending the signal
specified in sigev_signo. If the signal is caught with a
signal handler that was registered using the sigaction(2)
SA_SIGINFO flag, then the following fields are set in the
siginfo_t structure that is passed as the second argument of
the handler: si_code is set to SI_MESGQ; si_signo is set to
the signal number; si_value is set to the value specified in
notification-&gt;sigev_value; si_pid is set to the PID of
the process that sent the message; and si_uid is set to the
real user ID of the sending process. The same information is
available if the signal is accepted using sig-
waitinfo(2).</p>

<p>SIGEV_THREAD Deliver notification by invoking notifica-
tion-&gt;sigev_notify_function as the start function of a
new thread. The function is invoked with
notification-&gt;sigev_value as its sole argument. If
notification-&gt;sigev_notify_attributes is not NULL, then
it should point to a pthread_attr_t structure that defines
attributes for the thread (see pthread_attr_init(3)).</p>

<p>Only one process can be registered to receive
notification from a mes- sage queue.</p>

<p>If notification is NULL, and the calling process is
currently regis- tered to receive notifications for this
message queue, then the regis- tration is removed; another
process can then register to receive a mes- sage
notification for this queue.</p>

<p>Message notification only occurs when a new message
arrives and the queue was previously empty. If the queue was
not empty at the time mq_notify() was called, then a
notification will only occur after the queue is emptied and
a new message arrives.</p>

<p>If another process or thread is waiting to read a
message from an empty queue using mq_receive(3), then any
message notification registration is ignored: the message is
delivered to the process or thread calling mq_receive(3),
and the message notification registration remains in
effect.</p>

<p>Notification occurs once: after a notification is
delivered, the noti- fication registration is removed, and
another process can register for message notification. If
the notified process wishes to receive the next
notification, it can use mq_notify() to request a further
notifi- cation. This should be done before emptying all
unread messages from the queue. (Placing the queue in
non-blocking mode is useful for emp- tying the queue of
messages without blocking once it is empty.)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success mq_notify() returns 0; on error,
-1 is returned, with errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF The descriptor specified in mqdes is
invalid.</p>

<p>EBUSY Another process has already registered to receive
notification for this message queue.</p>

<p>EINVAL notification-&gt;sigev_notify is not one of the
permitted values; or notification-&gt;sigev_notify is
SIGEV_SIGNAL and notifica- tion-&gt;sigev_signo is not a
valid signal number.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2008 says that an implementation may generate an
EINVAL error if notification is NULL, and the caller is not
currently registered to receive notifications for the queue
mqdes.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program registers a notification
request for the message queue named in its command-line
argument. Notification is performed by creating a thread.
The thread executes a function which reads one mes- sage
from the queue and then terminates the process.</p>

<p>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt; #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define handle_error(msg) do { perror(msg);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } while (0)</p>

<p>static void /* Thread start function */ tfunc(union
sigval sv) { struct mq_attr attr; ssize_t nr; void *buf;
mqd_t mqdes = *((mqd_t *) sv.sival_ptr);</p>

<p>/* Determine max. msg size; allocate buffer to receive
msg */</p>

<p>if (mq_getattr(mqdes, &amp;attr) == -1)
handle_error(&quot;mq_getattr&quot;); buf =
malloc(attr.mq_msgsize); if (buf == NULL)
handle_error(&quot;malloc&quot;);</p>

<p>nr = mq_receive(mqdes, buf, attr.mq_msgsize, NULL); if
(nr == -1) handle_error(&quot;mq_receive&quot;);</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Read %ld bytes from MQ0, (long) nr);
free(buf); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); /* Terminate the process */
}</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { mqd_t mqdes; struct
sigevent not;</p>

<p>assert(argc == 2);</p>

<p>mqdes = mq_open(argv[1], O_RDONLY); if (mqdes == (mqd_t)
-1) handle_error(&quot;mq_open&quot;);</p>

<p>not.sigev_notify = SIGEV_THREAD;
not.sigev_notify_function = tfunc;
not.sigev_notify_attributes = NULL;
not.sigev_value.sival_ptr = &amp;mqdes; /* Arg. to thread
func. */ if (mq_notify(mqdes, &amp;not) == -1)
handle_error(&quot;mq_notify&quot;);</p>

<p>pause(); /* Process will be terminated by thread
function */ }</p>
