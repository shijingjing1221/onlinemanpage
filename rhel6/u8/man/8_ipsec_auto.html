<p>DESCRIPTION Auto manipulates automatically-keyed
Libreswan IPsec connections, setting them up and shutting
them down based on the information in the IPsec
configuration file. In the normal usage, connection is the
name of a connection specification in the configuration
file; operation is --add, --delete, --replace, --up, --down,
--route, or --unroute. The --ready, --rereadsecrets,
--rereadgroups, and --status operations do not take a
connection name. Auto generates suitable commands and feeds
them to a shell for execution.</p>

<p>The --add operation adds a connection specification to
the internal database within pluto; it will fail if pluto
already has a specification by that name. The --delete
operation deletes a connection specification from
pluto&acute;s internal database (also tearing down any
connections based on it); The --replace operation is
equivalent to --delete (if there is already a loaded
connection by the given name) followed by --add, and is a
convenience for updating pluto&acute;s internal
specification to match an external one. (Note that a
--rereadsecrets may also be needed.) The --rereadgroups
operation causes any changes to the policy group files to
take effect (this is currently a synonym for --ready, but
that may change). None of the other operations alters the
internal database.</p>

<p>The --up operation asks pluto to establish a connection
based on an entry in its internal database. The --down
operation tells pluto to tear down such a connection.</p>

<p>Normally, pluto establishes a route to the destination
specified for a connection as part of the --up operation.
However, the route (for KLIPS) and packet capture (KLIPS and
NETKEY) can be established with the --route operation. Until
and unless an actual connection is established, this
discards any packets sent there, which may be preferable to
having them sent elsewhere based on a more general route
(e.g., a default route).</p>

<p>Normally, pluto&acute;s route (KLIPS) or packet capture
(NETKEY) to a destination remains in place when a --down
operation is used to take the connection down (or if
connection setup, or later automatic rekeying, fails). This
permits establishing a new connection (perhaps using a
different specification; the route is altered as necessary)
without having a window in which packets might go elsewhere
based on a more general route. Such a route can be removed
using the --unroute operation (and is implicitly removed by
--delete).</p>

<p>The --ready operation tells pluto to listen for
connection-setup requests from other hosts. Doing an --up
operation before doing --ready on both ends is futile and
will not work, although this is now automated as part of
IPsec startup and should not normally be an issue.</p>

<p>The --status operation asks pluto for current connection
status. The output format is ad-hoc and likely to
change.</p>

<p>The --rereadsecrets operation tells pluto to re-read the
/etc/ipsec.secrets secret-keys file, which it normally reads
only at startup time. (This is currently a synonym for
--ready, but that may change.)</p>

<p>The --rereadsecrets operation tells pluto to re-read the
/etc/ipsec.secrets secret-keys file, which it normally reads
only at startup time. (This is currently a synonym for
--ready, but that may change.)</p>

<p>The --rereadcacerts operation reads all certificate
files contained in the /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts directory and
adds them to pluto&acute;s list of Certification Authority
(CA) certificates. Note CA certificates can and should be
stored inside NSS instead of in the /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts
directory which will result in automatic updates. This
option will be obsoleted in the near future.</p>

<p>The --rereadcrls operation reads all certificate
revocation list (CRL) files contained in the
/etc/ipsec.d/crls directory and adds them to pluto&acute;s
list of CRLs. Note CRLs can and should be stored inside NSS
instead of in the /etc/ipsec.d/crls directory which will
result in automatic updates. This option will be obsoleted
in the near future.</p>

<p>The --rereadall operation is equivalent to the execution
of --rereadsecrets, --rereadcacerts and --rereadcrls.</p>

<p>The --listpubkeys operation lists all RSA public keys
either received from peers via the IKE protocol embedded in
authenticated certificate payloads or loaded locally using
the rightcert / leftcert or rightr- sasigkey / leftrsasigkey
parameters in ipsec.conf(5).</p>

<p>The --listcerts operation lists all X.509 certificates
loaded locally using the rightcert and leftcert parameters
in ipsec.conf(5). To see all certificates in the NSS
database, use certutil -d /etc/ipsec.d -L.</p>

<p>The --checkpubkeys operation lists all loaded X.509
certificates which are about to expire or have been
expired.</p>

<p>The --listcacerts operation lists all X.509 CA
certificates contained in the NSS database.</p>

<p>The --listgroups operation lists all groups that are
either used in connection definitions in ipsec.conf(5) or
are embedded in loaded X.509 attributes certificates.</p>

<p>The --listcrls operation lists all Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRLs) either loaded locally from the
/etc/ipsec.d/crls directory or fetched dynamically from an
HTTP or LDAP server.</p>

<p>The --listall operation is equivalent to the execution
of --listpubkeys, --listcerts, --listcacerts, --listgroups,
--listcrls.</p>

<p>The --purgeocsp operation displays --listall and purges
the NSS OCSP cache.</p>

<p>The --showonly option causes auto to show the commands
it would run, on standard output, and not run them.</p>

<p>The --asynchronous option, applicable only to the up
operation, tells pluto to attempt to establish the
connection, but does not delay to report results. This is
especially useful to start multiple connections in parallel
when network links are slow.</p>

<p>The --verbose option instructs auto to pass through all
output from ipsec_whack(8), including log output that is
normally filtered out as uninteresting.</p>

<p>The --config option specifies a non-standard location
for the IPsec configuration file (default
/etc/ipsec.conf).</p>

<p>See ipsec.conf(5) for details of the configuration
file.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ipsec.conf default IPSEC configuration file
/etc/ipsec.d/ X.509 and Opportunistic Encryption files
/var/run/pluto/pluto.ctl Pluto command socket</p>

<p>HISTORY Originally written for the FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.</p>

<p>BUGS Although an --up operation does connection setup on
both ends, --down tears only one end of the connection down
(although the orphaned end will eventually time out).</p>

<p>There is no support for passthrough connections.</p>

<p>A connection description which uses %defaultroute for
one of its nexthop parameters but not the other may be
falsely rejected as erroneous in some circumstances.</p>

<p>The exit status of --showonly does not always reflect
errors discovered during processing of the request. (This is
fine for human inspection, but not so good for use in
scripts.)</p>
