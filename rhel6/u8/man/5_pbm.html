<p>The PBM Format(5) The PBM Format(5)</p>

<p>NAME pbm - Netpbm bi-level image format</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>The PBM format is a lowest common denominator monochrome
file format. It serves as the common language of a large
family of bitmap image con- version filters. Because the
format pays no heed to efficiency, it is simple and general
enough that one can easily develop programs to con- vert to
and from just about any other graphics format, or to
manipulate the image.</p>

<p>The name &quot;PBM&quot; is an acronym derived from
&quot;Portable Bit Map.&quot;</p>

<p>This is not a format that one would normally use to
store a file or to transmit it to someone -- it s too
expensive and not expressive enough for that. Its just an
intermediary format. In it s purest use, it lives only in a
pipe between two other programs.</p>

<p>The format definition is as follows.</p>

<p>A PBM file consists of a sequence of one or more PBM
images. There are no data, delimiters, or padding before,
after, or between images.</p>

<p>Each PBM image consists of the following:</p>

<p>&middot; A magic number for identifying the file type. A
pbm images magic number is the two characters P4.</p>

<p>&middot; Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).</p>

<p>&middot; The width in pixels of the image, formatted as
ASCII characters in decimal.</p>

<p>&middot; Whitespace.</p>

<p>&middot; The height in pixels of the image, again in
ASCII decimal.</p>

<p>&middot; A single whitespace character (usually a
newline).</p>

<p>&middot; A raster of Height rows, in order from top to
bottom. Each row is Width bits, packed 8 to a byte, with
dont care bits to fill out the last byte in the row. Each
bit represents a pixel: 1 is black, 0 is white. The order of
the pixels is left to right. The order of their storage
within each file byte is most signif- icant bit to least
significant bit. The order of the file bytes is from the
beginning of the file toward the end of the file.</p>

<p>A row of an image is horizontal. A column is vertical.
The pixels in the image are square and contiguous.</p>

<p>&middot; Before the whitespace character that delimits
the raster, any characters from a # through the next
carriage return or new- line character, is a comment and is
ignored. Note that this is rather unconventional, because a
comment can actually be in the middle of what you might
consider a token. Note also that this means if you have a
comment right before the raster, the newline at the end of
the comment is not sufficient to delimit the raster.</p>

<p>There is actually another version of the PBM format,
even more simplis- tic, more lavishly wasteful of space than
PBM, called Plain PBM. Plain PBM actually came first, but
even its inventor couldn t stand its reck- lessly
squanderous use of resources after a while and switched to
what we now know as the regular PBM format. But Plain PBM is
so redundant -- so overstated -- that its virtually
impossible to break. You can send it through the most
liberal mail system (which was the original purpose of the
PBM format) and it will arrive still readable. You can flip
a dozen random bits and easily piece back together the
original image. And we hardly need to define the format
here, because you can decode it by inspection.</p>

<p>Netpbm programs generate Raw PBM format instead of Plain
PBM by default, but the common option -plain chooses Plain
PBM.</p>

<p>The difference is:</p>

<p>- There is exactly one image in a file.</p>

<p>- The magic number is P1 instead of P4.</p>

<p>- Each pixel in the raster is represented by a byte
containing ASCII 1 or 0 , representing black and white
respectively. There are no fill bits at the end of a
row.</p>

<p>- White space in the raster section is ignored.</p>

<p>- You can put any junk you want after the raster, if it
starts with a white space character.</p>

<p>- No line should be longer than 70 characters.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a small image in the plain PBM
format. P1 # feep.pbm 24 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0</p>

<p>There is a newline character at the end of each of these
lines.</p>

<p>You can generate the Plain PBM format from the regular
PBM format (first image in the file only) with the
pnmtoplainpnm program.</p>

<p>Programs that read this format should be as lenient as
possible, accepting anything that looks remotely like a
bitmap.</p>

<p>All characters referred to herein are encoded in ASCII.
newline refers the the character known in ASCII as Line Feed
or LF. A white space character is space, CR, LF, TAB, VT, or
FF (I.e. what the ANSI standard C isspace() function calls
white space).</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Before July 2000, there could be at most
one image in a PBM file. As a result, most tools to process
PBM files ignore (and dont read) any data after the first
image.</p>
