<p>curl_multi_assign(3) libcurl Manual
curl_multi_assign(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_multi_assign - set data to association with an
internal socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLMcode curl_multi_assign(CURLM *multi_handle,
curl_socket_t sockfd, void *sockptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function assigns an association in the
multi handle between the given socket and a private pointer
of the application. This is (only) useful for
curl_multi_socket(3) uses.</p>

<p>When set, the sockptr pointer will be passed to all
future socket call- backs for the specific sockfd
socket.</p>

<p>If the given sockfd isnt already in use by libcurl, this
function will return an error.</p>

<p>libcurl only keeps one single pointer associated with a
socket, so calling this function several times for the same
socket will make the last set pointer get used.</p>

<p>The idea here being that this association (socket to
private pointer) is something that just about every
application that uses this API will need and then libcurl
can just as well do it since it already has an internal hash
table lookup for this.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The standard CURLMcode for multi interface
error codes.</p>

<p>TYPICAL USAGE In a typical application you allocate a
struct or at least use some kind of semi-dynamic data for
each socket that we must wait for action on when using the
curl_multi_socket(3) approach.</p>

<p>When our socket-callback gets called by libcurl and we
get to know about yet another socket to wait for, we can use
curl_multi_assign(3) to point out the particular data so
that when we get updates about this same socket again, we
dont have to find the struct associated with this socket by
ourselves.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This function was added in libcurl 7.15.5,
although not deemed stable yet.</p>
