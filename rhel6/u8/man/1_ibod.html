<p>NAME ibod - ISDN MPPP bandwidth on demand daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ibod</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ibod is a ISDN MPPP bandwidth on demand
daemon designed to operate in conjunction with isdn4linux.
It is normally started at boot time, but can be started and
stopped at any time. The program monitors inbound and
outbound traffic on the ISDN interface. When the required
bandwidth exceeds the capacity for one IDSN B-channel
(64kbps) a second (slave) channel is connected according to
the MPPP protocol. When the traffic decreases below one
channel capacity, the slave channel is discon- nected.</p>

<p>A configuration file /etc/ppp/ibod.cf is read initially.
The device /dev/isdninfo is monitored for the current state
and throughput of the ISDN interface. All operation on the
ISDN interface is made through the /dev/isdnctrl
interface.</p>

<p>Ibod is also listening on TCP port 6050 for eventual
connection from control panel</p>

<p>SIGNALS Upon receiving SIGHUP, the configuration file is
re-read. A SIGPIPE closes an eventual socket connection with
xibod.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Variable IBOD_HOME specifies the directory
where to look for the con- figuration file ibod.cf.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All logging is made to syslog with the
identity tag ibod.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ibod.cf(4) and xibod(1)</p>
