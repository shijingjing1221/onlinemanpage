<p>NAME watchgnupg - Read and print logs from a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS watchgnupg [--force] [--verbose] socketname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Most of the main utilities are able to write
their log files to a Unix Domain socket if configured that
way. watchgnupg is a simple listener for such a socket. It
ameliorates the output with a time stamp and makes sure that
long lines are not interspersed with log output from other
utilities.</p>

<p>watchgnupg is commonly invoked as</p>

<p>watchgnupg --force ~/.gnupg/S.log</p>

<p>OPTIONS watchgnupg understands these options:</p>

<p>--force Delete an already existing socket file.</p>

<p>--verbose Enable extra informational output.</p>

<p>--version Print version of the program and exit.</p>

<p>--help Display a brief help page and exit.</p>

installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>
