<p>NAME sx, sb, sz - XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM file send</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sz [-+8abdefkLlNnopqTtuvyY] file ... sb
[-adfkqtuv] file ... sx [-akqtuv] file sz [-oqtv] -c COMMAND
sz [-oqtv] -i COMMAND sz -TT</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sz uses the ZMODEM, YMODEM or XMODEM error
correcting protocol to send one or more files over a dial-in
serial port to a variety of programs running under PC-DOS,
CP/M, Unix, VMS, and other operating systems.</p>

<p>While rz is smart enough to be called from cu(1), very
few versions of cu(1) are smart enough to allow sz to work
properly. Unix flavors of Professional-YAM are available for
such dial-out application.</p>

<p>Sz sends one or more files with ZMODEM protocol.</p>

<p>ZMODEM greatly simplifies file transfers compared to
XMODEM. In addi- tion to a friendly user interface, ZMODEM
provides Personal Computer and other users an efficient,
accurate, and robust file transfer method.</p>

<p>ZMODEM provides complete END-TO-END data integrity
between application programs. ZMODEMs 32 bit CRC catches
errors that sneak into even the most advanced networks.</p>

<p>Advanced file management features include AutoDownload
(Automatic file Download initiated without user
intervention), Display of individual and total file lengths
and transmission time estimates, Crash Recovery, selective
file transfers, and preservation of exact file date and
length.</p>

<p>Output from another program may be piped to sz for
transmission by denoting standard input with &quot;-&quot;:
ls -l | sz - The program output is transmitted with the
filename sPID.sz where PID is the process ID of the sz
program. If the environment variable ONAME is set, that is
used instead. In this case, the Unix command: ls -l |
ONAME=con sz -ay - will send a &quot;file&quot; to the
PC-DOS console display. The -y option instructs the receiver
to open the file for writing unconditionally. The -a option
causes the receiver to convert Unix newlines to PC-DOS
carriage returns and linefeeds.</p>

<p>Sb batch sends one or more files with YMODEM or ZMODEM
protocol. The initial ZMODEM initialization is not sent.
When requested by the receiver, sb supports YMODEM-g with
&quot;cbreak&quot; tty mode, XON/XOFF flow control, and
interrupt character set to CAN (^X). YMODEM-g (Profes-
sional-YAM g option) increases throughput over error free
channels (direct connection, X.PC, etc.) by not
acknowledging each transmitted sector.</p>

<p>On Unix systems, additional information about the file
is transmitted. If the receiving program uses this
information, the transmitted file length controls the exact
number of bytes written to the output dataset, and the
modify time and file mode are set accordingly.</p>

<p>Sx sends a single file with XMODEM or XMODEM-1k protocol
(sometimes incorrectly called &quot;ymodem&quot;). The user
must supply the file name to both sending and receiving
programs.</p>

<p>If sz is invoked with $SHELL set and iff that variable
contains the string rsh , rbash or rksh (restricted shell),
sz operates in restricted mode. Restricted mode restricts
pathnames to the current directory and PUBDIR (usually
/usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or subdirecto- ries thereof.</p>

<p>The fourth form sends a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM
receiver for execu- tion. Sz exits with the COMMAND return
value. If COMMAND includes spaces or characters special to
the shell, it must be quoted.</p>

<p>The fifth form sends a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM
receiver for execu- tion. Sz exits as soon as the receiver
has correctly received the com- mand, before it is
executed.</p>

<p>The sixth form (sz -TT) attempts to output all 256 code
combinations to the terminal. In you are having difficulty
sending files, this command lets you see which character
codes are being eaten by the operating system.</p>

<p>If sz is invoked with stdout and stderr to different
datasets, Verbose is set to 2, causing frame by frame
progress reports to stderr. This may be disabled with the q
option.</p>

<p>The meanings of the available options are:</p>

<p>-+, --append Instruct the receiver to append transmitted
data to an existing file (ZMODEM only). -2, --twostop use
two stop bits (if possible). Do not use this unless you know
what you are doing. -8, --try-8k Try to go up to 8KB
blocksize. This is incompatible with stan- dard zmodem, but
a common extension in the bbs world. (ZMODEM only).
--start-8k Start with 8KB blocksize. Like --try-8k. -a,
--ascii Convert NL characters in the transmitted file to
CR/LF. This is done by the sender for XMODEM and YMODEM, by
the receiver for ZMODEM. -b, --binary (ZMODEM) Binary
override: transfer file without any translation. -B NUMBER,
--bufsize NUMBER Use a readbuffer of NUMBER bytes. Default
ist 16384, which should be enough for most situations. If
you have a slow machine or a bad disk interface or suffer
from other hardware problems you might want to increase the
buffersize. -1 or auto use a buffer large enough to buffer
the whole file. Be careful with this option - things
normally get worse, not better, if the machine starts to
swap.</p>

<p>Using this option turns of memory mapping of the input
file. This increases memory and cpu usage. -c COMMAND,
--command COMMAND Send COMMAND to the receiver for
execution, return with COM- MAND&acute;s exit status. -C N,
--command-tries N Retry to send command N times (default:
11). -d, --dot-to-slash Change all instances of
&quot;.&quot; to &quot;/&quot; in the transmitted pathname.
Thus, C.omenB0000 (which is unacceptable to MSDOS or CP/M)
is transmitted as C/omenB0000. If the resultant filename has
more than 8 characters in the stem, a &quot;.&quot; is
inserted to allow a total of eleven.</p>

<p>This option enables the --full-path option.
--delay-startup N Wait N seconds before doing anything. -e,
--escape Escape all control characters; normally XON, XOFF,
DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X are escaped. Force the sender to
rename the new file if a file with the same name already
exists. -f, --full-path Send Full pathname. Normally
directory prefixes are stripped from the transmitted
filename.</p>

<p>This is also turned on with to --dot-to-slash option.
-h, --help give help. -i COMMAND, --immediate-command
COMMAND Send COMMAND to the receiver for execution, return
immediately upon the receiving programs successful recption
of the command. -k, --1k (XMODEM/YMODEM) Send files using
1024 byte blocks rather than the default 128 byte blocks.
1024 byte packets speed file transfers at high bit rates.
(ZMODEM streams the data for the best possible throughput.)
-L N, --packetlen N Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length N. A
larger N (32 &lt;= N &lt;= 1024) gives slightly higher
throughput, a smaller N speeds error recovery. The default
is 128 below 300 baud, 256 above 300 baud, or 1024 above
2400 baud. -m N, --min-bps N Stop transmission if BPS-Rate
(Bytes Per Second) falls below N for a certain time (see
--min-bps-time option). -M N, --min-bps-time Used together
with --min-bps. Default is 120 (seconds). -l N, --framelen N
Wait for the receiver to acknowledge correct data every N
(32 &lt;= N &lt;= 1024) characters. This may be used to
avoid network over- run when XOFF flow control is lacking.
-n, --newer (ZMODEM) Send each file if destination file does
not exist. Overwrite destination file if source file is
newer than the des- tination file. -N, --newer-or-longer
(ZMODEM) Send each file if destination file does not exist.
Overwrite destination file if source file is newer or longer
than the destination file. -o, --16-bit-crc (ZMODEM) Disable
automatic selection of 32 bit CRC. -O, --disable-timeouts
Disable read timeout handling. This makes lsz hang if the
other side doesn t send anything, but increases performance
(not much) and decreases system load (reduces number of
system calls by about 50 percent).</p>

<p>Use this option with care. -p, --protect (ZMODEM)
Protect existing destination files by skipping transfer if
the destination file exists. -q, --quiet Quiet suppresses
verbosity. -R, --restricted Restricted mode: restricts
pathnames to the current directory and PUBDIR (usually
/usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or subdirectories thereof. -r,
--resume (ZMODEM) Resume interrupted file transfer. If the
source file is longer than the destination file, the
transfer commences at the offset in the source file that
equals the length of the des- tination file. -s HH:MM,
--stop-at HH:MM Stop transmission at HH hours, MM minutes.
Another variant, using +N instead of HH:MM, stops
transmission in N seconds. -S, --timesync enable timesync
protocol support. See timesync.doc for further
information.</p>

<p>This option is incompatible with standard zmodem. Use it
with care. --syslog[=off] turn syslogging on or off. the
default is set at configure time. This option is ignored if
no syslog support is compiled in. -t TIM, --timeout TIM
Change timeout to TIM tenths of seconds. -T, --turbo Do not
escape certain characters (^P, ^P|0x80, telenet escape
sequence [CR + @]). This improves performance by about 1
percent and shouldn t hurt in the normal case (but be
careful - ^P might be useful if connected through a terminal
server). --tcp Try to initiate a TCP/IP connection. lsz will
ask the receiving zmodem to open a TCP/IP connection. All
handshaking (which address / port to use) will be done by
the zmodem programs.</p>

<p>You will normally not want to use this option as lrzsz
is the only zmodem which understands what to do (private
extension). You might want to use this option if the two
programs are con- nected (stdin/out) over a slow or bad (not
8bit clean) network connection.</p>

<p>Use of this option imposes a security risk, somebody
else could connect to the port in between. See SECURITY for
details. --tcp-client ADDRESS:PORT Act as a tcp/ip client:
Connect to the given port.</p>

<p>See --tcp-server for more information.</p>

<p>--tcp-server Act as a server: Open a socket, print out
what to do, wait for connection.</p>

<p>You will normally not want to use this option as lrzsz
is the only zmodem which understands what to do (private
extension). You might want to use this if you have to use
zmodem (for which reason whatever), and cannot use the --tcp
option of lsz (per- haps because your telnet doesnt allow to
spawn a local program with stdin/stdout connected to the
remote side).</p>

<p>If you use this option you have to start lsz with the
--tcp- client ADDRESS:PORT option. lrz will print the
address and port on startup.</p>

<p>Use of this option imposes a security risk, somebody
else could connect to the port in between. See SECURITY for
details.</p>

<p>-u Unlink the file after successful transmission. -U,
--unrestrict Turn off restricted mode (this is not possible
if running under a restricted shell). -w N, --windowsize N
Limit the transmit window size to N bytes (ZMODEM). -v,
--verbose Verbose output to stderr. More vs generate more
output. -X, --xmodem use XMODEM protocol. -y, --overwrite
Instruct a ZMODEM receiving program to overwrite any
existing file with the same name. -Y, --overwrite-or-skip
Instruct a ZMODEM receiving program to overwrite any
existing file with the same name, and to skip any source
files that do have a file with the same pathname on the
destination system. --ymodem use ZMODEM protocol. -Z,
--zmodem use ZMODEM protocol.</p>

<p>SECURITY Restricted mode restricts pathnames to the
current directory and PUBDIR (usually /var/spool/uucppublic)
and/or subdirectories thereof, and dis- ables remote command
execution.</p>

<p>Restricted mode is entered if the R option is given or
if lsz detects that it runs under a restricted shell or if
the environment variable ZMODEM_RESTRICTED is found.</p>

<p>Restricted mode can be turned of with the U option if
not running under a restricted shell.</p>

<p>Use of the --tcp-client or --tcp-server options imposes
a security risk, as somebody else could connect to the port
before you do it, and grab your data. If theres strong
demand for a more secure mode i might introduce some sort of
password challenge.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT ZNULLS may be used to specify the number of
nulls to send before a ZDATA frame.</p>

<p>SHELL lsz recognizes a restricted shell if this variable
includes rsh or rksh</p>

<p>ZMODEM_RESTRICTED lrz enters restricted mode if the
variable is set.</p>

<p>TMPDIR If this environment variable is set its content
is used as the directory to place in the answer file to a
timesync request. TMP Used instead of TMPDIR if TMPDIR is
not set. If neither TMPDIR nor TMP is set /tmp will be
used.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ZMODEM File Transfer (Unix to
DSZ/ZCOMM/Professional-YAM) % sz -a *.c This single command
transfers all .c files in the current Unix direc- tory with
conversion (-a) to end of line conventions appropriate to
the receiving environment. With ZMODEM AutoDownload enabled,
Professional- YAM and ZCOMM will automatically recieve the
files after performing a security check.</p>

<p>% sz -Yan *.c *.h Send only the .c and .h files that
exist on both systems, and are newer on the sending system
than the corresponding version on the receiving system,
converting Unix to DOS text format. $ sz Yan file1.c file2.c
file3.c foo.h baz.h &reg;(for VMS)</p>

<p>ZMODEM Command Download (Unix to Professional-YAM)
cpszall:all sz -c &quot;c:;cd /yam/dist&quot; sz -ya
$(YD)/*.me sz -yqb y*.exe sz -c &quot;cd /yam&quot; sz -i
&quot;!insms&quot; This Makefile fragment uses sz to issue
commands to Professional-YAM to change current disk and
directory. Next, sz transfers the .me files from the $YD
directory, commanding the receiver to overwrite the old
files and to convert from Unix end of line conventions to
PC-DOS con- ventions. The third line transfers some .exe
files. The fourth and fifth lines command Pro-YAM to change
directory and execute a PC-DOS batch file insms . Since the
batch file takes considerable time, the -i form is used to
allow sz to exit immediately.</p>

<p>XMODEM File Transfer (Unix to Crosstalk) % sx -a foo.c
ESC rx foo.c The above three commands transfer a single file
from Unix to a PC and Crosstalk with sz translating Unix
newlines to DOS CR/LF. This combi- nation is much slower and
far less reliable than ZMODEM.</p>

<p>ERROR MESSAGES &quot;Caught signal 99&quot; indicates
the program was not properly compiled, refer to
&quot;bibi(99)&quot; in rbsb.c for details.</p>

<p>Compile time options required for various operating
systems are described in the source file.</p>

<p>VMS VERSION The VMS version does not support wild cards.
Because of VMS DCL, upper case option letters muse be
represented by proceding the letter.</p>

<p>The current VMS version does not support XMODEM,
XMODEM-1k, or YMODEM.</p>

<p>VMS C Standard I/O and RMS may interact to modify the
file contents.</p>

<p>TESTING FEATURE The command &quot;sz -T file&quot;
exercises the Attn sequence error recovery by commanding
errors with unterminated packets. The receiving program
should complain five times about binary data packets being
too long. Each time sz is interrupted, it should send a
ZDATA header followed by another defective packet. If the
receiver does not detect five long data packets, the Attn
sequence is not interrupting the sender, and the Myattn
string in sz.c must be modified.</p>

<p>After 5 packets, sz stops the &quot;transfer&quot; and
prints the total number of characters &quot;sent&quot;
(Tcount). The difference between Tcount and 5120 represents
the number of characters stored in various buffers when the
Attn sequence is generated.</p>

<p>BUGS Calling sz from most versions of cu(1) doesnt work
because cus receive process fights sz for characters from
the modem.</p>

<p>On at least one BSD system, sz would hang or exit when
it got within a few kilobytes of the end of file. Using the
&quot;-w 8192&quot; flag fixed the problem. The real cause
is unknown, perhaps a bug in the kernel TTY output
routines.</p>

<p>Programs that do not properly implement the specified
file transfer protocol may cause sz to &quot;hang&quot; the
port for a minute or two. This problem is corrected by using
ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, or other program with a correct
implementation of the specified protocol.</p>

<p>Many programs claiming to support YMODEM only support
XMODEM with 1k blocks, and they often dont get that quite
right.</p>

<p>XMODEM transfers add up to 127 garbage bytes per file.
XMODEM-1k and YMODEM-1k transfers use 128 byte blocks to
avoid extra padding.</p>

<p>YMODEM programs use the file length transmitted at the
beginning of the transfer to prune the file to the correct
length; this may cause prob- lems with source files that
grow during the course of the transfer. This problem does
not pertain to ZMODEM transfers, which preserve the exact
file length unconditionally.</p>

<p>Most ZMODEM options are merely passed to the receiving
program; some do not implement all these options.</p>

<p>Circular buffering and a ZMODEM sliding window should be
used when input is from pipes instead of acknowledging
frames each 1024 bytes. If no files can be opened, sz sends
a ZMODEM command to echo a suitable complaint; perhaps it
should check for the presence of at least one accessible
file before getting hot and bothered. The test mode leaves a
zero length file on the receiving system.</p>

<p>A few high speed modems have a firmware bug that drops
characters when the direction of high speed transmissson is
reversed. The environment variable ZNULLS may be used to
specify the number of nulls to send before a ZDATA frame.
Values of 101 for a 4.77 mHz PC and 124 for an AT are
typical.</p>
