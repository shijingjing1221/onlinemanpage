<p>KILLALL5(8) Linux System Administrator s Manual
KILLALL5(8)</p>

<p>NAME killall5 -- send a signal to all processes.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS killall5 -signalnumber [-o omitpid] [-o
omitpid..]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION killall5 is the SystemV killall command. It
sends a signal to all pro- cesses except kernel threads and
the processes in its own session, so it wont kill the shell
that is running the script it was called from. Its primary
(only) use is in the rc scripts found in the /etc/init.d
directory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o omitpid Tells killall5 to omit processes with
that process id.</p>

<p>NOTES killall5 can also be invoked as pidof, which is
simply a (symbolic) link to the killall5 program.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The program return zero if it killed
processes. It return 2 if no pro- cess were killed, and 1 if
it was unable to find any processes (/proc/ is missing).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO halt(8), reboot(8), pidof(8)</p>
