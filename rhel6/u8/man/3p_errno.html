<p>ERRNO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ERRNO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME errno - error return value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;errno.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lvalue errno is used by many functions
to return error values.</p>

<p>Many functions provide an error number in errno, which
has type int and is defined in &lt;errno.h&gt;. The value of
errno shall be defined only after a call to a function for
which it is explicitly stated to be set and until it is
changed by the next function call or if the application
assigns it a value. The value of errno should only be
examined when it is indicated to be valid by a functions
return value. Applications shall obtain the definition of
errno by the inclusion of &lt;errno.h&gt;. No function in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 shall set errno to
0.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether errno is a macro or an
identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro
definition is suppressed in order to access an actual
object, or a program defines an identifier with the name
errno, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The symbolic values stored in errno are documented in
the ERRORS sec- tions on all relevant pages.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE None.</p>

<p>ERRORS None.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Previously both POSIX and X/Open
documents were more restrictive than the ISO C standard in
that they required errno to be defined as an external
variable, whereas the ISO C standard required only that
errno be defined as a modifiable lvalue with type int.</p>

<p>An application that needs to examine the value of errno
to determine the error should set it to 0 before a function
call, then inspect it before a subsequent function call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
