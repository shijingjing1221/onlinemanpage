<p>CHGRP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CHGRP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME chgrp - change the file group ownership</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chgrp [-hR] group file ...</p>

<p>chgrp -R [-H | -L | -P ] group file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The chgrp utility shall set the group ID of
the file named by each file operand to the group ID
specified by the group operand.</p>

<p>For each file operand, or, if the -R option is used,
each file encoun- tered while walking the directory trees
specified by the file operands, the chgrp utility shall
perform actions equivalent to the chown() func- tion defined
in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
called with the following arguments:</p>

<p>* The file operand shall be used as the path
argument.</p>

<p>* The user ID of the file shall be used as the owner
argument.</p>

<p>* The specified group ID shall be used as the group
argument.</p>

<p>Unless chgrp is invoked by a process with appropriate
privileges, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a
regular file shall be cleared upon successful completion;
the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of other file types
may be cleared.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The chgrp utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-h If the system supports group IDs for symbolic links,
for each file operand that names a file of type symbolic
link, chgrp shall attempt to set the group ID of the
symbolic link instead of the file referenced by the symbolic
link. If the system does not support group IDs for symbolic
links, for each file operand that names a file of type
symbolic link, chgrp shall do nothing more with the current
file and shall go on to any remaining files.</p>

<p>-H If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
referencing a file of type directory is specified on the
command line, chgrp shall change the group of the directory
referenced by the sym- bolic link and all files in the file
hierarchy below it.</p>

<p>-L If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
referencing a file of type directory is specified on the
command line or encountered during the traversal of a file
hierarchy, chgrp shall change the group of the directory
referenced by the sym- bolic link and all files in the file
hierarchy below it.</p>

<p>-P If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link is
specified on the command line or encountered during the
traversal of a file hierarchy, chgrp shall change the group
ID of the symbolic link if the system supports this
operation. The chgrp utility shall not follow the symbolic
link to any other part of the file hierarchy.</p>

<p>-R Recursively change file group IDs. For each file
operand that names a directory, chgrp shall change the group
of the directory and all files in the file hierarchy below
it. Unless a -H, -L, or -P option is specified, it is
unspecified which of these options will be used as the
default.</p>

<p>Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive
options -H, -L, and -P shall not be considered an error. The
last option specified shall determine the behavior of the
utility.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>group A group name from the group database or a numeric
group ID. Either specifies a group ID to be given to each
file named by one of the file operands. If a numeric group
operand exists in the group database as a group name, the
group ID number associ- ated with that group name is used as
the group ID.</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file whose group ID is to be
modified.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of chgrp:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The utility executed successfully and all requested
changes were made.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Only the owner of a file or the user
with appropriate privileges may change the owner or group of
a file.</p>

<p>Some implementations restrict the use of chgrp to a user
with appropri- ate privileges when the group specified is
not the effective group ID or one of the supplementary group
IDs of the calling process.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The System V and BSD versions use different
exit status codes. Some implementations used the exit status
as a count of the number of errors that occurred; this
practice is unworkable since it can overflow the range of
valid exit status values. The standard developers chose to
mask these by specifying only 0 and &gt;0 as exit
values.</p>

<p>The functionality of chgrp is described substantially
through refer- ences to chown(). In this way, there is no
duplication of effort required for describing the
interactions of permissions, multiple groups, and so on.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, chown()</p>
