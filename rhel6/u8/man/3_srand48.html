<p>DRAND48(3) Linux Programmer s Manual DRAND48(3)</p>

<p>NAME drand48, erand48, lrand48, nrand48, mrand48,
jrand48, srand48, seed48, lcong48 - generate uniformly
distributed pseudo-random numbers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>double drand48(void);</p>

<p>double erand48(unsigned short xsubi[3]);</p>

<p>long int lrand48(void);</p>

<p>long int nrand48(unsigned short xsubi[3]);</p>

<p>long int mrand48(void);</p>

<p>long int jrand48(unsigned short xsubi[3]);</p>

<p>void srand48(long int seedval);</p>

<p>unsigned short *seed48(unsigned short seed16v[3]);</p>

<p>void lcong48(unsigned short param[7]);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>All functions shown above: _SVID_SOURCE ||
_XOPEN_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions generate pseudo-random
numbers using the linear congru- ential algorithm and 48-bit
integer arithmetic.</p>

<p>The drand48() and erand48() functions return
non-negative double-preci- sion floating-point values
uniformly distributed between [0.0, 1.0).</p>

<p>The lrand48() and nrand48() functions return
non-negative long integers uniformly distributed between 0
and 2^31.</p>

<p>The mrand48() and jrand48() functions return signed long
integers uni- formly distributed between -2^31 and 2^31.</p>

<p>The srand48(), seed48() and lcong48() functions are
initialization functions, one of which should be called
before using drand48(), lrand48() or mrand48(). The
functions erand48(), nrand48() and jrand48() do not require
an initialization function to be called first.</p>

<p>All the functions work by generating a sequence of
48-bit integers, Xi, according to the linear congruential
formula:</p>

<p>Xn+1 = (aXn + c) mod m, where n &gt;= 0</p>

<p>The parameter m = 2^48, hence 48-bit integer arithmetic
is performed. Unless lcong48() is called, a and c are given
by:</p>

<p>a = 0x5DEECE66D c = 0xB</p>

<p>The value returned by any of the functions drand48(),
erand48(), lrand48(), nrand48(), mrand48() or jrand48() is
computed by first gen- erating the next 48-bit Xi in the
sequence. Then the appropriate num- ber of bits, according
to the type of data item to be returned, is copied from the
high-order bits of Xi and transformed into the returned
value.</p>

<p>The functions drand48(), lrand48() and mrand48() store
the last 48-bit Xi generated in an internal buffer. The
functions erand48(), nrand48() and jrand48() require the
calling program to provide storage for the successive Xi
values in the array argument xsubi. The functions are
initialized by placing the initial value of Xi into the
array before calling the function for the first time.</p>

<p>The initializer function srand48() sets the high order
32-bits of Xi to the argument seedval. The low order 16-bits
are set to the arbitrary value 0x330E.</p>

<p>The initializer function seed48() sets the value of Xi
to the 48-bit value specified in the array argument seed16v.
The previous value of Xi is copied into an internal buffer
and a pointer to this buffer is returned by seed48().</p>

<p>The initialization function lcong48() allows the user to
specify ini- tial values for Xi, a and c. Array argument
elements param[0-2] spec- ify Xi, param[3-5] specify a, and
param[6] specifies c. After lcong48() has been called, a
subsequent call to either srand48() or seed48() will restore
the standard values of a and c.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES These functions are declared obsolete by SVID 3,
which states that rand(3) should be used instead.</p>
