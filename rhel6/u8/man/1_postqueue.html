<p>POSTQUEUE(1) POSTQUEUE(1)</p>

<p>NAME postqueue - Postfix queue control</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -f postqueue
[-v] [-c config_dir] -i queue_id postqueue [-v] [-c
config_dir] -p postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -s site</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The postqueue(1) command implements the
Postfix user interface for queue management. It implements
operations that are traditionally available via the
sendmail(1) command. See the postsuper(1) command for queue
operations that require super-user privileges such as delet-
ing a message from the queue or changing the status of a
message.</p>

<p>The following options are recognized:</p>

<p>-c config_dir The main.cf configuration file is in the
named directory instead of the default configuration
directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG environment setting
below.</p>

<p>-f Flush the queue: attempt to deliver all queued
mail.</p>

<p>This option implements the traditional &quot;sendmail
-q&quot; command, by contacting the Postfix qmgr(8)
daemon.</p>

<p>Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will
result in poor delivery performance of all other mail.</p>

<p>-i queue_id Schedule immediate delivery of deferred mail
with the specified queue ID.</p>

<p>This option implements the traditional sendmail -qI
command, by contacting the flush(8) server.</p>

<p>This feature is available with Postfix version 2.4 and
later.</p>

<p>-p Produce a traditional sendmail-style queue listing.
This option implements the traditional mailq command, by
contacting the Postfix showq(8) daemon.</p>

<p>Each queue entry shows the queue file ID, message size,
arrival time, sender, and the recipients that still need to
be deliv- ered. If mail could not be delivered upon the last
attempt, the reason for failure is shown. This mode of
operation is imple- mented by executing the postqueue(1)
command. The queue ID string is followed by an optional
status character:</p>

<p>* The message is in the active queue, i.e. the message
is selected for delivery.</p>

<p>! The message is in the hold queue, i.e. no further
deliv- ery attempt will be made until the mail is taken off
hold.</p>

<p>-s site Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is
queued for the named site. A numerical site must be
specified as a valid RFC 2821 address literal enclosed in
[], just like in email addresses. The site must be eligible
for the &quot;fast flush&quot; ser- vice. See flush(8) for
more information about the &quot;fast flush&quot;
service.</p>

<p>This option implements the traditional &quot;sendmail
-qRsite&quot; com- mand, by contacting the Postfix flush(8)
daemon.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
Multiple -v options make the software increasingly verbose.
As of Postfix 2.3, this option is available for the
super-user only.</p>

<p>SECURITY This program is designed to run with set-group
ID privileges, so that it can connect to Postfix daemon
processes.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems are logged to syslogd(8) and to the
standard error stream.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MAIL_CONFIG Directory with the main.cf file.
In order to avoid exploitation of set-group ID privileges, a
non-standard directory is allowed only if:</p>

<p>&middot; The name is listed in the standard main.cf file
with the alternate_config_directories configuration
parameter.</p>

<p>&middot; The command is invoked by the super-user.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS The following main.cf
parameters are especially relevant to this pro- gram. The
text below provides only a parameter summary. See post-
conf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>alternate_config_directories (empty) A list of
non-default Postfix configuration directories that may be
specified with &quot;-c config_directory&quot; on the
command line, or via the MAIL_CONFIG environment
parameter.</p>

<p>config_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The default
location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf con-
figuration files.</p>

<p>command_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
all postfix administrative commands.</p>

<p>fast_flush_domains ($relay_domains) Optional list of
destinations that are eligible for per-destina- tion
logfiles with mail that is queued to those destinations.</p>

<p>import_environment (seepostconf -doutput) The list of
environment parameters that a Postfix process will import
from a non-Postfix parent process.</p>

<p>queue_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
the Postfix top-level queue directory.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so
that &quot;smtpd&quot; becomes, for example, &quot;post-
fix/smtpd&quot;.</p>

<p>trigger_timeout (10s) The time limit for sending a
trigger to a Postfix daemon (for example, the pickup(8) or
qmgr(8) daemon).</p>

<p>Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later:</p>

<p>authorized_flush_users (static:anyone) List of users who
are authorized to flush the queue.</p>

<p>authorized_mailq_users (static:anyone) List of users who
are authorized to view the queue.</p>
