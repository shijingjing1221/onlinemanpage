<p>NAME ldns-gen-zone - read a zonefile and print it while
adding DS records and extra RRs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-gen-zone ZONEFILE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-gen-zone reads a DNS zone file and
prints it.</p>

<p>It is build for speed, not for a nice formatting. The
output has one resource record per line and no
pretty-printing makeup.</p>

<p>DNSSEC data (NSEC, NSEC3, RRSIG or DNSKEY) is not
stripped. You may want to use ldns-read-zone for that.
Existing DS records are also not stripped.</p>

<p>The idea is to use this tool for quickly generating a
representative artificial zonefile from a real zonefile, to
use it for testing pur- poses.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a NUM Adds NUM extra artificial NS RRSets to
the output. The RRSets owner names start with xn-- in an
attempt to ensure uniqueness (nl.-zone does not support IDNs
- and this tool was written with that knowledge in
mind).</p>

<p>An artificial NS RRSet has two NS records;
ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com.</p>

<p>-p NUM Add NUM% of DS RRSets to the NS RRSets (anywhere
between 1-4 DS records per RRSet).</p>

<p>-o ORIGIN Sets an $ORIGIN, which can be handy if the one
in the zonefile is set to @ for example. If there is an
$ORIGIN in the zone- file, this option will silently be
ignored.</p>

<p>-s This is the recommended way of processing large zones
that are already sorted and canonicalized (ie lowercase). It
skips the sorting and canonicalization step that is required
for properly grouping RRSets together (before adding any DS
records to them. Skipping this step will speed things
up.</p>

<p>It is not recommended to use this option if you want to
add DS records to unsorted, non-canonicalized zones.</p>

<p>-h Show usage and exit.</p>

<p>-v Show version and exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ldns-gen-zone -a 100000 -p 10 -s ./zonefile.txt
Read a zonefile, add 100.000 artificial NS RRSets and 10% of
DS records, print it to standard output. Dont sort (will
only work well if the input zonefile is already sorted and
canonicalized).</p>

<p>ldns-gen-zone -p 10 -s -o nl zonefile.txt |
named-compilezone -s rela- tive -i none -o zonefile_10.txt
nl /dev/stdin This creates a nicely formatted zone file with
the help of named-compilezone. It adds 10% DS records to the
.nl zone, reformats it and saves it as zonefile_10.txt.</p>

<p>REPORTING BUGS Report bugs to
&lt;ldns-team@nlnetlabs.nl&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS Only undiscovered ones.</p>

<p>CAVEATS May require a machine with a considerable amount
of memory for large zone files.</p>

<p>Fake DS records hashes are generated as digest type
SHA-256 (RFC4509). Be aware not to change the DIGESTTYPE
#define in the source code in anything else but 2 if you
want to keep things realistic.</p>

<p>Despite a number of efforts, this program is still not
the fastest in the world.</p>
