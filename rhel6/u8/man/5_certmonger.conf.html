<p>NAME certmonger.conf - configuration file for
certmonger</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The certmonger.conf file contains default
settings used by certmonger. Its format is more or less that
of a typical INI-style file. The only sections currently of
note are named defaults and selfsign.</p>

<p>DEFAULTS Within the defaults section, these variables
and values are recognized:</p>

<p>notify_ttls This is the list of times, given in seconds,
before a certifi- cates not-after validity date (often
referred to as its expira- tion time) when certmonger should
warn that the certificate will soon no longer be valid. If
this value is not specified, cert- monger will attempt to
use the value of the ttls setting. The default list of
values is &quot;2419200, 604800, 259200, 172800,
86400&quot;.</p>

<p>enroll_ttls This is the list of times, given in seconds,
before a certifi- cates not-after validity date (often
referred to as its expira- tion time) when certmonger should
attempt to automatically renew the certificate, if it is
configured to do so. If this value is not specified,
certmonger will attempt to use the value of the ttls
setting. The default list of values is &quot;2419200,
604800, 259200, 172800, 86400&quot;.</p>

<p>notification_method This is the method by which
certmonger will notify the system administrator that a
certificate will soon become invalid. The recognized values
are syslog, mail, and command. The default is syslog. When
sending mail, the notification message will be the mail
message subject. When invoking a command, the notification
message will be available in the
&quot;CERTMONGER_NOTIFICATION&quot; envi- ronment
variable.</p>

<p>notification_destination This is the destination to
which certmonger will send notifica- tions. It can be a
syslog priority and/or facility, separated by a period, it
can be an email address, or it can be a command to run. The
default value is daemon.notice.</p>

<p>key_type This is the type of key pair which will be
generated, used in certificate signing requests, and used
when self-signing cer- tificates. RSA and DSA are supported.
EC (also known as ECDSA) is also supported. The default is
RSA.</p>

<p>symmetric_cipher This is the symmetric cipher which will
be used to encrypt pri- vate keys stored in OpenSSL s PEM
format. Recognized values include aes128 and aes256. The
default is aes128. It is not recommended that this value be
changed except in cases where the default is incompatible
with other software.</p>

<p>digest This is the digest algorithm which will be used
when signing certificate signing requests and self-signed
certificates. Rec- ognized values include sha1, sha256,
sha384, and sha512. The default is sha256. It is not
recommended that this value be changed except in cases where
the default is incompatible with other software.</p>

<p>nss_ca_trust These are the trust attributes which are
applied to CA certifi- cates which should be trusted, when
they are saved to NSS databases. The default is CT,C,C.</p>

<p>nss_other_trust These are the trust attributes which are
applied to certificates which are not necessarily to be
trusted, when they are saved to NSS databases. The default
is ,,.</p>

<p>SELFSIGN Within the selfsign section, these variables
and values are recognized:</p>

<p>validity_period This is the validity period given to
self-signed certificates. The value is specified as a
combination of years (y), months (M), weeks (w), days (d),
hours (h), minutes (m), and/or seconds (s). If no unit of
time is specified, seconds are assumed. The default value is
1y.</p>

<p>populate_unique_id This controls whether or not
self-signed certificates will have their subjectUniqueID and
issuerUniqueID fields populated. While RFC5280 prohibits
their use, they may be needed and/or used by older
applications. The default value is no.</p>

<p>LOCAL Within the local section, these variables and
values are recognized:</p>

<p>validity_period This is the validity period given to the
locally-signed CAs certificate when it is generated. The
value is specified as a combination of years (y), months
(M), weeks (w), days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), and/or
seconds (s). If no unit of time is specified, seconds are
assumed. If not set, the value of the validity_period
setting from the selfsign section, if one is set there, will
be used. The default value is 1y.</p>
