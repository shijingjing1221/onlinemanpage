<p>STRFTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRFTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strftime - convert date and time to a string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t strftime(char *restrict s, size_t maxsize, const
char *restrict format, const struct tm *restrict
timeptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strftime() function shall place bytes
into the array pointed to by s as controlled by the string
pointed to by format. The format is a character string,
beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The
format string consists of zero or more conversion specifica-
tions and ordinary characters. A conversion specification
consists of a %character, possibly followed by an E or O
modifier, and a termi- nating conversion specifier character
that determines the conversion specification s behavior. All
ordinary characters (including the termi- nating null byte)
are copied unchanged into the array. If copying takes place
between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. No
more than maxsize bytes are placed into the array. Each
conversion specifier is replaced by appropriate characters
as described in the following list. The appropriate
characters are determined using the LC_TIME cate- gory of
the current locale and by the values of zero or more members
of the broken-down time structure pointed to by timeptr, as
specified in brackets in the description. If any of the
specified values are outside the normal range, the
characters stored are unspecified.</p>

<p>Local timezone information is used as though strftime()
called tzset().</p>

<p>The following conversion specifications are
supported:</p>

<p>%a Replaced by the locales abbreviated weekday name. [
tm_wday]</p>

<p>%A Replaced by the locale s full weekday name. [
tm_wday]</p>

<p>%b Replaced by the locales abbreviated month name. [
tm_mon]</p>

<p>%B Replaced by the locales full month name. [
tm_mon]</p>

<p>%c Replaced by the locales appropriate date and time
representa- tion. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;time.h&gt;.)</p>

<p>%C Replaced by the year divided by 100 and truncated to
an integer, as a decimal number [00,99]. [ tm_year]</p>

<p>%d Replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number
[01,31]. [ tm_mday]</p>

<p>%D Equivalent to %m / %d / %y . [ tm_mon, tm_mday,
tm_year]</p>

<p>%e Replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number
[1,31]; a single digit is preceded by a space. [
tm_mday]</p>

<p>%F Equivalent to %Y - %m - %d (the ISO 8601:2000
standard date for- mat). [ tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday]</p>

<p>%g Replaced by the last 2 digits of the week-based year
(see below) as a decimal number [00,99]. [ tm_year, tm_wday,
tm_yday]</p>

<p>%G Replaced by the week-based year (see below) as a
decimal number (for example, 1977). [ tm_year, tm_wday,
tm_yday]</p>

<p>%h Equivalent to %b . [ tm_mon]</p>

<p>%H Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal
number [00,23]. [ tm_hour]</p>

<p>%I Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal
number [01,12]. [ tm_hour]</p>

<p>%j Replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number
[001,366]. [ tm_yday]</p>

<p>%m Replaced by the month as a decimal number [01,12]. [
tm_mon]</p>

<p>%M Replaced by the minute as a decimal number [00,59]. [
tm_min]</p>

<p>%n Replaced by a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>%p Replaced by the locales equivalent of either a.m. or
p.m. [ tm_hour]</p>

<p>%r Replaced by the time in a.m. and p.m. notation; in
the POSIX locale this shall be equivalent to %I : %M : %S %p
. [ tm_hour, tm_min, tm_sec]</p>

<p>%R Replaced by the time in 24-hour notation ( %H : %M ).
[ tm_hour, tm_min]</p>

<p>%S Replaced by the second as a decimal number [00,60]. [
tm_sec]</p>

<p>%t Replaced by a &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>%T Replaced by the time ( %H : %M : %S ). [ tm_hour,
tm_min, tm_sec]</p>

<p>%u Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [1,7],
with 1 repre- senting Monday. [ tm_wday]</p>

<p>%U Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal
number [00,53]. The first Sunday of January is the first day
of week 1; days in the new year before this are in week 0. [
tm_year, tm_wday, tm_yday]</p>

<p>%V Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as
the first day of the week) as a decimal number [01,53]. If
the week containing 1 January has four or more days in the
new year, then it is con- sidered week 1. Otherwise, it is
the last week of the previous year, and the next week is
week 1. Both January 4th and the first Thursday of January
are always in week 1. [ tm_year, tm_wday, tm_yday]</p>

<p>%w Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [0,6],
with 0 repre- senting Sunday. [ tm_wday]</p>

<p>%W Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal
number [00,53]. The first Monday of January is the first day
of week 1; days in the new year before this are in week 0. [
tm_year, tm_wday, tm_yday]</p>

<p>%x Replaced by the locale s appropriate date
representation. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, &lt;time.h&gt;.)</p>

<p>%X Replaced by the locale s appropriate time
representation. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, &lt;time.h&gt;.)</p>

<p>%y Replaced by the last two digits of the year as a
decimal number [00,99]. [ tm_year]</p>

<p>%Y Replaced by the year as a decimal number (for
example, 1997). [ tm_year]</p>

<p>%z Replaced by the offset from UTC in the ISO 8601:2000
standard format ( +hhmm or -hhmm ), or by no characters if
no timezone is determinable. For example, &quot;-0430&quot;
means 4 hours 30 minutes behind UTC (west of Greenwich). If
tm_isdst is zero, the stan- dard time offset is used. If
tm_isdst is greater than zero, the daylight savings time
offset is used. If tm_isdst is negative, no characters are
returned. [ tm_isdst]</p>

<p>%Z Replaced by the timezone name or abbreviation, or by
no bytes if no timezone information exists. [ tm_isdst]</p>

<p>%% Replaced by % .</p>

<p>If a conversion specification does not correspond to any
of the above, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>If a struct tm broken-down time structure is created by
localtime() or localtime_r(), or modified by mktime(), and
the value of TZ is subse- quently modified, the results of
the %Z and %z strftime() conversion specifiers are
undefined, when strftime() is called with such a broken-
down time structure.</p>

<p>If a struct tm broken-down time structure is created or
modified by gmtime() or gmtime_r(), it is unspecified
whether the result of the %Z and %z conversion specifiers
shall refer to UTC or the current local timezone, when
strftime() is called with such a broken-down time struc-
ture.</p>

<p>Modified Conversion Specifiers Some conversion
specifiers can be modified by the E or O modifier char-
acters to indicate that an alternative format or
specification should be used rather than the one normally
used by the unmodified conversion specifier. If the
alternative format or specification does not exist for the
current locale (see ERA in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 7.3.5, LC_TIME), the behavior
shall be as if the unmodified conversion specification were
used.</p>

<p>%Ec Replaced by the locales alternative appropriate date
and time representation.</p>

<p>%EC Replaced by the name of the base year (period) in
the locales alternative representation.</p>

<p>%Ex Replaced by the locale s alternative date
representation.</p>

<p>%EX Replaced by the locale s alternative time
representation.</p>

<p>%Ey Replaced by the offset from %EC (year only) in the
locales alternative representation.</p>

<p>%EY Replaced by the full alternative year
representation.</p>

<p>%Od Replaced by the day of the month, using the locales
alternative numeric symbols, filled as needed with leading
zeros if there is any alternative symbol for zero;
otherwise, with leading spaces.</p>

<p>%Oe Replaced by the day of the month, using the locales
alternative numeric symbols, filled as needed with leading
spaces.</p>

<p>%OH Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) using the
locales alterna- tive numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OI Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) using the
locales alterna- tive numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Om Replaced by the month using the locale s alternative
numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OM Replaced by the minutes using the locale s
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OS Replaced by the seconds using the locale s
alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Ou Replaced by the weekday as a number in the locales
alternative representation (Monday=1).</p>

<p>%OU Replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as
the first day of the week, rules corresponding to %U ) using
the locales alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OV Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as
the first day of the week, rules corresponding to %V ) using
the locales alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Ow Replaced by the number of the weekday (Sunday=0)
using the locales alternative numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%OW Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as
the first day of the week) using the locales alternative
numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%Oy Replaced by the year (offset from %C ) using the
locales alter- native numeric symbols.</p>

<p>%g, %G, and %V give values according to the ISO
8601:2000 standard week-based year. In this system, weeks
begin on a Monday and week 1 of the year is the week that
includes January 4th, which is also the week that includes
the first Thursday of the year, and is also the first week
that contains at least four days in the year. If the first
Monday of January is the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding
days are part of the last week of the preceding year; thus,
for Saturday 2nd January 1999, %G is replaced by 1998 and %V
is replaced by 53. If December 29th, 30th, or 31st is a
Monday, it and any following days are part of week 1 of the
following year. Thus, for Tuesday 30th December 1997, %G is
replaced by 1998 and %V is replaced by 01.</p>

<p>If a conversion specifier is not one of the above, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the total number of resulting bytes
including the terminating null byte is not more than
maxsize, strftime() shall return the number of bytes placed
into the array pointed to by s, not including the termi-
nating null byte. Otherwise, 0 shall be returned and the
contents of the array are unspecified.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting a Localized Date String The following
example first sets the locale to the users default. The
locale information will be used in the nl_langinfo() and
strftime() functions. The nl_langinfo() function returns the
localized date string which specifies how the date is laid
out. The strftime() function takes this information and,
using the tm structure for values, places the date and time
information into datestring.</p>

<p>#include &lt;time.h&gt; #include &lt;locale.h&gt;
#include &lt;langinfo.h&gt; ... struct tm *tm; char
datestring[256]; ... setlocale (LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;); ...
strftime (datestring, sizeof(datestring), nl_langinfo
(D_T_FMT), tm); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The range of values for %S is [00,60]
rather than [00,59] to allow for the occasional leap
second.</p>

<p>Some of the conversion specifications are duplicates of
others. They are included for compatibility with nl_cxtime()
and nl_ascxtime(), which were published in Issue 2.</p>

<p>Applications should use %Y (4-digit years) in preference
to %y (2-digit years).</p>

<p>In the C locale, the E and O modifiers are ignored and
the replacement strings for the following specifiers
are:</p>

<p>%a The first three characters of %A .</p>

<p>%A One of Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday.</p>

<p>%b The first three characters of %B .</p>

<p>%B One of January, February, ..., December.</p>

<p>%c Equivalent to %a %b %e %T %Y .</p>

<p>%p One of AM or PM.</p>

<p>%r Equivalent to %I : %M : %S %p .</p>

<p>%x Equivalent to %m / %d / %y .</p>

<p>%X Equivalent to %T .</p>

<p>%Z Implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
