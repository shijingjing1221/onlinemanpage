<p>ENUM POSITIVE_AOP_RE(9) The Linux VFS ENUM
POSITIVE_AOP_RE(9)</p>

<p>NAME enum_positive_aop_returns - aop return codes with
specific semantics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS enum positive_aop_returns {
AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE, AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE };</p>

<p>CONSTANTS AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE Informs the caller that
page writeback has completed, that the page is still locked,
and should be considered active. The VM uses this hint to
return the page to the active list -- it won&acute;t be a
candidate for writeback again in the near future. Other
callers must be careful to unlock the page if they get this
return. Returned by writepage;</p>

<p>AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE The AOP method that was handed a
locked page has unlocked it and the page might have been
truncated. The caller should back up to acquiring a new page
and trying again. The aop will be taking reasonable
precautions not to livelock. If the caller held a page
reference, it should drop it before retrying. Returned by
readpage.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION address_space_operation functions return
these large constants to indicate special semantics to the
caller. These are much larger than the bytes in a page to
allow for functions that return the number of bytes operated
on in a given page.</p>
