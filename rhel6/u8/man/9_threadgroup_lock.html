<p>THREADGROUP_LOCK(9) Driver Basics
THREADGROUP_LOCK(9)</p>

<p>NAME threadgroup_lock - lock threadgroup</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void threadgroup_lock(struct task_struct *
tsk);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS tsk member task of the threadgroup to lock</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Lock the threadgroup tsk belongs to. No new
task is allowed to enter and member tasks aren&acute;t
allowed to exit (as indicated by PF_EXITING) or change
-&gt;group_leader/pid. This is useful for cases where the
threadgroup needs to stay stable across blockable
operations.</p>

<p>fork and exit paths explicitly call
threadgroup_change_{begin|end}() for synchronization. While
held, no new task will be added to threadgroup and no
existing live task will have its PF_EXITING set.</p>

<p>de_thread does threadgroup_change_{begin|end}() when a
non-leader sub-thread becomes a new leader.</p>
