<p>cmannotifyd(8) CMAN Notification Daemon
cmannotifyd(8)</p>

<p>NAME cmannotifyd - CMAN Notification Daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cmannotifyd [-f] [-d]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cmannotifyd daemon talks to CMAN and
provides a mechanism to notify external entities about
cluster changes.</p>

<p>CMAN dispatches 3 kind of notifications:</p>

<p>- CMAN_REASON_TRY_SHUTDOWN when cman requests to all
clients if it is allowed to shutdown.</p>

<p>- CMAN_REASON_STATECHANGE when cman detects a node
joining or leaving the cluster.</p>

<p>- CMAN_REASON_CONFIG_UPDATE when a configuration change
event has been detected/requested.</p>

<p>These notifications are then dispatched to the shell
script cman_notify in the environment variable
CMAN_NOTIFICATION.</p>

<p>cman_notify will then execute all the scripts in the
configured notifi- cation directory (default:
/etc/cluster/cman-notify.d) passing a very minimal set of
envvars including, of course, the CMAN_NOTIFICATION= type.
The execution order is set by the filename as shown by
&quot;LC_ALL=C ls -las&quot;.</p>

<p>cmannotifyd logs are stored in the default log file
(/var/log/clus- ter/cmannotifyd.log).</p>

<p>cman_notify logs are stored in the default log file
(/var/log/clus- ter/cman_notify.log). By default the output
from the scripts executed by cman_notify is redirected to
/dev/null. Users can either set CMAN_NOTIFICATION_DEBUG=1 in
their environment or set proper debug con- figuration in
cluster.conf to redirect scripts output to the cman_notify
log file.</p>

<p>NOTES cmannotifyd does not block on cman_notify nor
check the exit status of the script.</p>

<p>Notifications are dispatched in the same order as they
arrive, one by one.</p>

<p>CMAN_REASON_TRY_SHUTDOWN is passed to scripts for
information only, they can not influence cmans decsion about
whether or not to shut down.</p>

<p>CMAN_REASON_STATECHANGE also implies
CMAN_NOTIFICATION_QUORUM exported in the environment.
CMAN_NOTIFICATION_QUORUM will be set to 1 (when the node is
part of a quorate cluster) or 0 (otherwise).</p>

<p>A template for cman_notify scripts can be found in the
doc/ directory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Run in the foreground (do not fork /
daemonize).</p>

<p>-d Enable debug output.</p>
