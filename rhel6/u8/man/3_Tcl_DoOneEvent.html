<p>Tcl_DoOneEvent(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_DoOneEvent(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_DoOneEvent - wait for events and invoke event
handlers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_DoOneEvent(flags)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int flags (in) This parameter is normally
zero. It may be an OR-ed combination of any of the following
flag bits: TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS, TCL_FILE_EVENTS,
TCL_TIMER_EVENTS, TCL_IDLE_EVENTS, TCL_ALL_EVENTS, or
TCL_DONT_WAIT.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This procedure is the entry point to Tcls
event loop; it is responsi- ble for waiting for events and
dispatching event handlers created with procedures such as
Tk_CreateEventHandler, Tcl_CreateFileHandler,
Tcl_CreateTimerHandler, and Tcl_DoWhenIdle. Tcl_DoOneEvent
checks to see if events are already present on the Tcl event
queue; if so, it calls the handler(s) for the first (oldest)
event, removes it from the queue, and returns. If there are
no events ready to be handled, then Tcl_DoOneEvent checks
for new events from all possible sources. If any are found,
it puts all of them on Tcls event queue, calls handlers for
the first event on the queue, and returns. If no events are
found, Tcl_DoOneEvent checks for Tcl_DoWhenIdle callbacks;
if any are found, it invokes all of them and returns.
Finally, if no events or idle callbacks have been found,
then Tcl_DoOneEvent sleeps until an event occurs; then it
adds any new events to the Tcl event queue, calls han- dlers
for the first event, and returns. The normal return value is
1 to signify that some event was processed (see below for
other alterna- tives).</p>

<p>If the flags argument to Tcl_DoOneEvent is non-zero, it
restricts the kinds of events that will be processed by
Tcl_DoOneEvent. Flags may be an OR-ed combination of any of
the following bits:</p>

<p>TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS - Process window system events.</p>

<p>TCL_FILE_EVENTS - Process file events.</p>

<p>TCL_TIMER_EVENTS - Process timer events.</p>

<p>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS - Process idle callbacks.</p>

<p>TCL_ALL_EVENTS - Process all kinds of events: equivalent
to OR-ing together all of the above flags or specifying none
of them.</p>

<p>TCL_DONT_WAIT - Do not sleep: process only events that
are ready at the time of the call.</p>

<p>If any of the flags TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS, TCL_FILE_EVENTS,
TCL_TIMER_EVENTS, or TCL_IDLE_EVENTS is set, then the only
events that will be considered are those for which flags are
set. Setting none of these flags is equivalent to the value
TCL_ALL_EVENTS, which causes all event types to be
processed. If an application has defined additional event
sources with Tcl_CreateEventSource, then additional flag
values may also be valid, depending on those event
sources.</p>

<p>The TCL_DONT_WAIT flag causes Tcl_DoOneEvent not to put
the process to sleep: it will check for events but if none
are found then it returns immediately with a return value of
0 to indicate that no work was done. Tcl_DoOneEvent will
also return 0 without doing anything if the only alternative
is to block forever (this can happen, for example, if flags
is TCL_IDLE_EVENTS and there are no Tcl_DoWhenIdle callbacks
pending, or if no event handlers or timer handlers
exist).</p>

<p>Tcl_DoOneEvent may be invoked recursively. For example,
it is possible to invoke Tcl_DoOneEvent recursively from a
handler called by Tcl_DoOneEvent. This sort of operation is
useful in some modal situa- tions, such as when a
notification dialog has been popped up and an application
wishes to wait for the user to click a button in the dialog
before doing anything else.</p>
