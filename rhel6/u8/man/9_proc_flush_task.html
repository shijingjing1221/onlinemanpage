<p>PROC_FLUSH_TASK(9) The proc filesystem
PROC_FLUSH_TASK(9)</p>

<p>NAME proc_flush_task - Remove dcache entries for task
from the /proc dcache.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void proc_flush_task(struct task_struct *
task);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS task task that should be flushed.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When flushing dentries from proc, one needs
to flush them from global proc (proc_mnt) and from all the
namespaces&acute; procs this task was seen in. This call is
supposed to do all of this job.</p>

<p>Looks in the dcache for /proc/pid /proc/tgid/task/pid if
either directory is present flushes it and all of
it&acute;ts children from the dcache.</p>

<p>It is safe and reasonable to cache /proc entries for a
task until that task exits. After that they just clog up the
dcache with useless entries, possibly causing useful dcache
entries to be flushed instead. This routine is proved to
flush those useless dcache entries at process exit time.</p>

<p>NOTE This routine is just an optimization so it does not
guarantee that no dcache entries will exist at process exit
time it just makes it very unlikely that any will
persist.</p>
