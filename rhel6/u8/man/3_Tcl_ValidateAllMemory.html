<p>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_DumpActiveMemory(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_DumpActiveMemory, Tcl_InitMemory,
Tcl_ValidateAllMemory - Validated memory allocation
interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_DumpActiveMemory(fileName)</p>

<p>void Tcl_InitMemory(interp)</p>

<p>void Tcl_ValidateAllMemory(fileName, line)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter in
which to add com- mands.</p>

<p>const char *fileName (in) For Tcl_DumpActiveMemory, name
of the file to which memory information will be written. For
Tcl_Vali- dateAllMemory, name of the file from which the
call is being made (nor- mally __FILE__).</p>

<p>int line (in) Line number at which the call to
Tcl_ValidateAllMemory is made (nor- mally __LINE__).

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions provide access to Tcl memory
debugging information. They are only functional when Tcl has
been compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG defined at compile-time.
When TCL_MEM_DEBUG is not defined, these functions are all
no-ops.</p>

<p>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory will output a list of all currently
allocated mem- ory to the specified file. The information
output for each allocated block of memory is: starting and
ending addresses (excluding guard zone), size, source file
where ckalloc was called to allocate the block and line
number in that file. It is especially useful to call
Tcl_DumpActiveMemory after the Tcl interpreter has been
deleted.</p>

<p>Tcl_InitMemory adds the Tcl memory command to the
interpreter given by interp. Tcl_InitMemory is called by
Tcl_Main.</p>

<p>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory forces a validation of the guard
zones of all currently allocated blocks of memory. Normally
validation of a block occurs when its freed, unless full
validation is enabled, in which case validation of all
blocks occurs when ckalloc and ckfree are called. This
function forces the validation to occur at any point.</p>
