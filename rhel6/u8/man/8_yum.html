<p>NAME yum - Yellowdog Updater Modified</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS yum [options] [command] [package ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION yum is an interactive, rpm based, package
manager. It can automatically perform system updates,
including dependency analysis and obsolete pro- cessing
based on &quot;repository&quot; metadata. It can also
perform installa- tion of new packages, removal of old
packages and perform queries on the installed and/or
available packages among many other commands/ser- vices (see
below). yum is similar to other high level package managers
like apt-get and smart.</p>

<p>While there are some graphical interfaces directly to
the yum code, more recent graphical interface development is
happening with Pack- ageKit and the gnome-packagekit
application.</p>

<p>command is one of: * install package1 [package2] [...] *
update [package1] [package2] [...] * update-to [package1]
[package2] [...] * check-update * upgrade [package1]
[package2] [...] * upgrade-to [package1] [package2] [...] *
distribution-synchronization [package1] [package2] [...] *
remove | erase package1 [package2] [...] * list [...] * info
[...] * provides | whatprovides feature1 [feature2] [...] *
clean [ packages | metadata | expire-cache | rpmdb | plugins
| all ] * makecache * groupinstall group1 [group2] [...] *
groupupdate group1 [group2] [...] * grouplist [hidden]
[groupwildcard] [...] * groupremove group1 [group2] [...] *
groupinfo group1 [...] * search string1 [string2] [...] *
shell [filename] * resolvedep dep1 [dep2] [...] *
localinstall rpmfile1 [rpmfile2] [...] (maintained for
legacy reasons only - use install) * localupdate rpmfile1
[rpmfile2] [...] (maintained for legacy reasons only - use
update) * reinstall package1 [package2] [...] * downgrade

<p>Unless the --help or -h option is given, one of the
above commands must be present.</p>

<p>Repository configuration is honored in all
operations.</p>

<p>install Is used to install the latest version of a
package or group of packages while ensuring that all
dependencies are satisfied. (See Specifying package names
for more information) If no pack- age matches the given
package name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob and any
matches are then installed. If the name starts with an @
character the rest of the name is used as though passed to
the groupinstall command. If the name starts with a -
character, then a search is done within the transaction and
any matches are removed. If the name is a file, then install
works like localinstall. If the name doesnt match a package,
then package &quot;provides&quot; are searched (e.g.
&quot;_sqlite- cache.so()(64bit)&quot;) as are filelists
(Eg. &quot;/usr/bin/yum&quot;). Also note that for
filelists, wildcards will match multiple packages.</p>

<p>update If run without any packages, update will update
every currently installed package. If one or more packages
or package globs are specified, Yum will only update the
listed packages. While updating packages, yum will ensure
that all dependencies are satisfied. (See Specifying package
names for more information) If the packages or globs
specified match to packages which are not currently
installed then update will not install them. update operates
on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>If the main obsoletes configure option is true (default)
or the --obsoletes flag is present yum will include package
obsoletes in its calculations - this makes it better for
distro-version changes, for example: upgrading from
somelinux 8.0 to somelinux 9.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;update&quot; works on installed packages
first, and only if there are no matches does it look for
available packages. The difference is most noticeable when
you do &quot;update foo-1-2&quot; which will act exactly as
&quot;update foo&quot; if foo-1-2 is installed. You can use
the &quot;update-to&quot; if youd prefer that nothing happen
in the above case.</p>

<p>update-to This command works like &quot;update&quot; but
always specifies the ver- sion of the package we want to
update to.</p>

<p>check-update Implemented so you could know if your
machine had any updates that needed to be applied without
running it interactively. Returns exit value of 100 if there
are packages available for an update. Also returns a list of
the packages to be updated in list format. Returns 0 if no
packages are available for update. Returns 1 if an error
occurred. Running in verbose mode also shows obsoletes.</p>

<p>upgrade Is the same as the update command with the
--obsoletes flag set. See update for more details.</p>

<p>upgrade-to This command works like &quot;upgrade&quot;
but always specifies the ver- sion of the package we want to
update to.</p>

<p>distribution-synchronization or distro-sync Synchronizes
the installed package set with the latest packages
available, this is done by either obsoleting, upgrading or
downgrading as appropriate. This will &quot;normally&quot;
do the same thing as the upgrade command however if you have
the package FOO installed at version 4, and the latest
available is only version 3, then this command will
downgrade FOO to version 3.</p>

<p>This command does not perform operations on groups,
local pack- ages or negative selections.</p>

<p>remove or erase Are used to remove the specified
packages from the system as well as removing any packages
which depend on the package being removed. remove operates
on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the
&quot;install&quot; command.(See Specifying pack- age names
for more information)</p>

<p>Note that &quot;yum&quot; is included in the
protected_packages configura- tion, by default. So you cant
accidentally remove yum itself.</p>

<p>list Is used to list various information about available
packages; more complete details are available in the List
Options section below.</p>

<p>provides or whatprovides Is used to find out which
package provides some feature or file. Just use a specific
name or a file-glob-syntax wildcards to list the packages
available or installed that provide that feature or
file.</p>

<p>search This is used to find packages when you know
something about the package but aren t sure of its name. By
default search will try searching just package names and
summaries, but if that &quot;fails&quot; it will then try
descriptions and url.</p>

<p>Yum search orders the results so that those packages
matching more terms will appear first.</p>

<p>You can force searching everything by specifying
&quot;all&quot; as the first argument.</p>

<p>info Is used to list a description and summary
information about available packages; takes the same
arguments as in the List Options section below.</p>

<p>clean Is used to clean up various things which
accumulate in the yum cache directory over time. More
complete details can be found in the Clean Options section
below.</p>

<p>makecache Is used to download and make usable all the
metadata for the currently enabled yum repos.</p>

<p>groupinstall Is used to install all of the individual
packages in a group, of the specified types (this works as
if youd taken each of those package names and put them on
the command line for a &quot;yum install&quot; command). The
group_package_types configuration option specifies which
types will be installed.</p>

<p>groupupdate Is just an alias for groupinstall, which
will do the right thing because &quot;yum install X&quot;
and &quot;yum update X&quot; do the same thing, when X is
already installed.</p>

<p>grouplist Is used to list the available groups from all
yum repos. Groups are marked as &quot;installed&quot; if all
mandatory packages are installed, or if a group doesn t have
any mandatory packages then it is installed if any of the
optional or default package are installed. The optional
&quot;hidden&quot; argument will also list groups marked as
not being &quot;user visible&quot;. If you pass the -v
option, to enable verbose mode, then the groupids are
displayed.</p>

<p>groupremove Is used to remove all of the packages in a
group, unlike &quot;groupinstall&quot; this will remove
everything regardless of group_package_types. It is worth
pointing out that packages can be in more than one group, so
&quot;groupinstall X Y&quot; followed by &quot;groupremove
Y&quot; does not do give you the same result as
&quot;groupinstall X&quot;.</p>

<p>The groupremove_leaf_only configuration changes the
behaviour of this command to only remove packages which
arent required by something else.</p>

<p>groupinfo Is used to give the description and package
list of a group (and which type those packages are marked
as). Note that you can use the yum-filter-data and
yum-list-data plugins to get/use the data the other way
around (Ie. what groups own packages need updating). If you
pass the -v option, to enable verbose mode, then the package
names are matched against installed/available packages
similar to the list command.</p>

<p>shell Is used to enter the yum shell, when a filename is
specified the contents of that file is executed in yum shell
mode. See yum-shell(8) for more info</p>

<p>resolvedep Is used to list packages providing the
specified dependencies, at most one package is listed per
dependency.</p>

<p>localinstall Is used to install a set of local rpm
files. If required the enabled repositories will be used to
resolve dependencies. Note that the install command will do
a local install, if given a filename. This option is
maintained for legacy reasons only.</p>

<p>localupdate Is used to update the system by specifying
local rpm files. Only the specified rpm files of which an
older version is already installed will be installed, the
remaining specified packages will be ignored. If required
the enabled repositories will be used to resolve
dependencies. Note that the update command will do a local
update, if given a filename. This option is main- tained for
legacy reasons only.</p>

<p>reinstall Will reinstall the identically versioned
package as is currently installed. This does not work for
&quot;installonly&quot; packages, like Kernels. reinstall
operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just like
the &quot;install&quot; command.</p>

<p>downgrade Will try and downgrade a package from the
version currently installed to the previously highest
version (or the specified version). The depsolver will not
necessarily work, but if you specify all the packages it
should work (and thus. all the sim- ple cases will work).
Also this does not work for &quot;installonly&quot;
packages, like Kernels. downgrade operates on groups, files,
provides, filelists and rpm files just like the
&quot;install&quot; com- mand.</p>

<p>deplist Produces a list of all dependencies and what
packages provide those dependencies for the given
packages.</p>

<p>repolist Produces a list of configured repositories. The
default is to list all enabled repositories. If you pass -v,
for verbose mode, more information is listed. If the first
argument is enabled, disabled or all then the command will
list those types of repos.</p>

<p>You can pass repo id or name arguments, or wildcards
which to match against both of those. However if the id or
name matches exactly then the repo will be listed even if
you are listing enabled repos. and it is disabled.</p>

<p>In non-verbose mode the first column will start with a *
if the repo. has metalink data and the latest metadata is
not local. For non-verbose mode the last column will also
display the number of packages in the repo. and (if there
are any user specified excludes) the number of packages
excluded.</p>

<p>One last special feature of repolist, is that if you are
in non- verbose mode then yum will ignore any repo errors
and output the information it can get (Eg. &quot;yum clean
all; yum -C repolist&quot; will output something, although
the package counts/etc. will be zeroed out).</p>

<p>version Produces a &quot;version&quot; of the rpmdb, and
of the enabled reposito- ries if &quot;all&quot; is given as
the first argument. You can also spec- ify version groups in
the version-groups configuration file. If you pass -v, for
verbose mode, more information is listed. The version is
calculated by taking an SHA1 hash of the packages (in sorted
order), and the checksum_type/checksum_data entries from the
yumdb. Note that this rpmdb version is now also used signif-
icantly within yum (esp. in yum history).</p>

<p>The version command will now show &quot;groups&quot; of
packages as a sep- arate version, and so takes
sub-commands:</p>

<p>&quot;version grouplist&quot; - List the defined version
groups.</p>

<p>&quot;version groupinfo&quot; - Get the complete list of
packages within one or more version groups.</p>

<p>&quot;version installed&quot; - This is the default,
only show the version information for installed
packages.</p>

<p>&quot;version available&quot; - Only show the version
information for available packages.</p>

<p>&quot;version all&quot; - Show the version information
for installed and available packages.</p>

<p>&quot;version nogroups | nogroups-*&quot; - Just show
the main version information.</p>

<p>&quot;version group-*&quot; - Just show the grouped
version information, if more arguments are given then only
show the data for those groups.</p>

<p>history The history command allows the user to view what
has happened in past transactions (assuming the
history_record config. option is set). You can use
info/list/packages-list/packages-info/summary to view what
happened, undo/redo/rollback to act on that infor- mation
and new to start a new history file.</p>

<p>The info/list/summary commands take either a transaction
id or a package (with wildcards, as in Specifying package
names), all three can also be passed no arguments. list can
be passed the keyword &quot;all&quot; to list all the
transactions.</p>

<p>The info command can also take ranges of transaction
ids, of the form start..end, which will then display a
merged history as if all the transactions in the range had
happened at once. Eg. &quot;history info 1..4&quot; will
merge the first four transactions and display them as a
single transaction.</p>

<p>The packages-list/packages-info commands takes a package
(with wildcards, as in Specifying package names). And show
data from the point of view of that package.</p>

<p>The undo/redo/rollback commands take either a single
transaction id or the keyword last and an offset from the
last transaction (Eg. if youve done 250 transactions,
&quot;last&quot; refers to transac- tion 250, and
&quot;last-4&quot; refers to transaction 246).</p>

<p>The undo/redo commands act on the specified transaction,
undoing or repeating the work of that transaction. While the
rollback command will undo all transactions up to the point
of the specified transaction. For example, if you have 3
transac- tions, where package A; B and C where installed
respectively. Then &quot;undo 1&quot; will try to remove
package A, &quot;redo 1&quot; will try to install package A
(if it is not still installed), and &quot;rollback 1&quot;
will try to remove packages B and C. Note that after a
&quot;roll- back 1&quot; you will have a fourth transaction,
although the ending rpmdb version (see: yum version) should
be the same in transac- tions 1 and 4.</p>

<p>The addon-info command takes a transaction ID, and the
packages- list command takes a package (with wildcards).</p>

<p>The stats command shows some statistics about the
current his- tory DB.</p>

<p>The sync commands allows you to change the rpmdb/yumdb
data stored for any installed packages, to whatever is in
the current rpmdb/yumdb (this is mostly useful when this
data was not stored when the package went into the history
DB).</p>

<p>In &quot;history list&quot; you can change the behaviour
of the 2nd column via the configuration option
history_list_view.</p>

<p>In &quot;history list&quot; output the Altered column
also gives some extra information if there was something not
good with the transaction (this is also shown at the end of
the package column in the packages-list command).</p>

<p>&gt; - The rpmdb was changed, outside yum, after the
transaction. &lt; - The rpmdb was changed, outside yum,
before the transaction. * - The transaction aborted before
completion. # - The transaction completed, but with a
non-zero status. E - The transaction completed fine, but had
warning/error output during the transaction. P - The
transaction completed fine, but problems already existed in
the rpmdb. s - The transaction completed fine, but
--skip-broken was enabled and had to skip some packages.</p>

<p>load-transaction This command will re-load a saved yum
transaction file, this allows you to run a transaction on
one machine and then use it on another. The two common ways
to get a saved yum transaction file are from &quot;yum -q
history addon-info last saved_tx&quot; or via the automatic
saves in $TMPDIR/yum_save_tx.* when a transaction is solved
but not run.</p>

<p>check Checks the local rpmdb and produces information on
any problems it finds. You can pass the check command the
arguments &quot;depen- dencies&quot;,
&quot;duplicates&quot;, &quot;obsoletes&quot; or
&quot;provides&quot;, to limit the checking that is
performed (the default is &quot;all&quot; which does
all).</p>

<p>help Produces help, either for all commands or if given
a command name then the help for that particular
command.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS Most command line options can be set
using the configuration file as well and the descriptions
indicate the necessary configuration option to set.</p>

<p>-h, --help Help; display a help message and then
quit.</p>

<p>-y, --assumeyes Assume yes; assume that the answer to
any question which would be asked is yes. Configuration
Option: assumeyes</p>

<p>--assumeno Assume no; assume that the answer to any
question which would be asked is no. This option overrides
assumeyes, but is still sub- ject to alwaysprompt.
Configuration Option: assumeno</p>

<p>-c, --config=[config file] Specifies the config file
location - can take HTTP and FTP URLs and local file
paths.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Run without output. Note that you likely
also want to use -y.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Run with a lot of debugging output.</p>

<p>-d, --debuglevel=[number] Sets the debugging level to
[number] - turns up or down the amount of things that are
printed. Practical range: 0 - 10 Configuration Option:
debuglevel</p>

<p>-e, --errorlevel=[number] Sets the error level to
[number] Practical range 0 - 10. 0 means print only critical
errors about which you must be told. 1 means print all
errors, even ones that are not overly important. 1+ means
print more errors (if any) -e 0 is good for cron jobs.
Configuration Option: errorlevel</p>

<p>--rpmverbosity=[name] Sets the debug level to [name] for
rpm scriptlets. info is the default, other options are:
critical, emergency, error, warn and debug. Configuration
Option: rpmverbosity</p>

<p>-R, --randomwait=[time in minutes] Sets the maximum
amount of time yum will wait before performing a command -
it randomizes over the time.</p>

<p>-C, --cacheonly Tells yum to run entirely from system
cache - does not download or update any headers unless it
has to to perform the requested action. If youre using this
as a user yum will not use the tempcache for the user but
will only use the system cache in the system cachedir.</p>

<p>--version Reports the yum version number and installed
package versions for everything in history_record_packages
(can be added to by plugins).</p>

<p>--showduplicates Doesnt limit packages to their latest
versions in the info, list and search commands (will also
affect plugins which use the doPackageLists() API).</p>

<p>--installroot=root Specifies an alternative installroot,
relative to which all packages will be installed.
Configuration Option: installroot</p>

<p>--enablerepo=repoidglob Enables specific repositories by
id or glob that have been dis- abled in the configuration
file using the enabled=0 option. Configuration Option:
enabled</p>

<p>--disablerepo=repoidglob Disables specific repositories
by id or glob. Configuration Option: enabled</p>

<p>--obsoletes This option only has affect for an update,
it enables yum&acute;s obsoletes processing logic. For more
information see the update command above. Configuration
Option: obsoletes</p>

<p>-x, --exclude=package Exclude a specific package by name
or glob from updates on all repositories. Configuration
Option: exclude</p>

<p>--color=[always|auto|never] Display colorized output
automatically, depending on the output terminal, always
(using ANSI codes) or never. Note that some commands (Eg.
list and info) will do a little extra work when color is
enabled. Configuration Option: color</p>

<p>--disableexcludes=[all|main|repoid] Disable the excludes
defined in your config files. Takes one of three options:
all == disable all excludes main == disable excludes defined
in [main] in yum.conf repoid == disable excludes defined for
that repo</p>

<p>--disableplugin=plugin Run with one or more plugins
disabled, the argument is a comma separated list of
wildcards to match against plugin names.</p>

<p>--noplugins Run with all plugins disabled. Configuration
Option: plugins</p>

<p>--nogpgcheck Run with GPG signature checking disabled.
Configuration Option: gpgcheck</p>

<p>--skip-broken Resolve depsolve problems by removing
packages that are causing problems from the transaction.
Configuration Option: skip_broken</p>

<p>--releasever=version Pretend the current release version
is the given string. This is very useful when combined with
--installroot. Note that with the default upstream cachedir,
of /var/cache/yum, using this option will corrupt your cache
(and you can use $releasever in your cachedir configuration
to stop this).</p>

<p>-t, --tolerant This option makes yum go slower, checking
for things that shouldn t be possible making it more
tolerant of external errors.</p>

<p>--downloadonly Dont update, just download.</p>

<p>--downloaddir=directory Specifies an alternate directory
to store packages.</p>

<p>--setopt=option=value Set any config option in yum
config or repo files. For options in the global config just
use: --setopt=option=value for repo options use:
--setopt=repoid.option=value</p>

<p>LIST OPTIONS The following are the ways which you can
invoke yum in list mode. Note that all list commands include
information on the version of the pack- age.</p>

<p>OUTPUT</p>

<p>The format of the output of yum list is:</p>

<p>name.arch [epoch:]version-release repo or
@installed-from-repo</p>

<p>yum list [all | glob_exp1] [glob_exp2] [...] List all
available and installed packages.</p>

<p>yum list available [glob_exp1] [...] List all packages
in the yum repositories available to be installed.</p>

<p>yum list updates [glob_exp1] [...] List all packages
with updates available in the yum reposito- ries.</p>

<p>yum list installed [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
specified by args. If an argument does not match the name of
an available package, it is assumed to be a shell-style glob
and any matches are printed.</p>

<p>yum list extras [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
installed on the system that are not available in any yum
repository listed in the config file.</p>

<p>yum list obsoletes [glob_exp1] [...] List the packages
installed on the system that are obsoleted by packages in
any yum repository listed in the config file.</p>

<p>yum list recent List packages recently added into the
repositories. This is often not helpful, but what you may
really want to use is &quot;yum list-updateinfo new&quot;
from the security yum plugin.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING PACKAGE NAMES A package can be referred to
for install, update, remove, list, info etc with any of the
following as well as globs of any of the following:</p>

<p>name name.arch name-ver name-ver-rel name-ver-rel.arch
name-epoch:ver-rel.arch epoch:name-ver-rel.arch</p>

<p>For example: yum remove kernel-2.4.1-10.i686 this will
remove this specific kernel-ver-rel.arch.</p>

<p>Or: yum list availablefoo* will list all available
packages that match foo*. (The single quotes will keep your
shell from expanding the globs.)</p>

<p>CLEAN OPTIONS The following are the ways which you can
invoke yum in clean mode. Note that &quot;all files&quot; in
the commands below means &quot;all files in currently
enabled repositories&quot;. If you want to also clean any
(temporarily) disabled repositories you need to use
--enablerepo*option.</p>

<p>yum clean expire-cache Eliminate the local data saying
when the metadata and mir- rorlists were downloaded for each
repo. This means yum will revalidate the cache for each
repo. next time it is used. How- ever if the cache is still
valid, nothing significant was deleted.</p>

<p>yum clean packages Eliminate any cached packages from
the system. Note that pack- ages are not automatically
deleted after they are downloaded.</p>

<p>yum clean headers Eliminate all of the header files,
which old versions of yum used for dependency
resolution.</p>

<p>yum clean metadata Eliminate all of the files which yum
uses to determine the remote availability of packages. Using
this option will force yum to download all the metadata the
next time it is run.</p>

<p>yum clean dbcache Eliminate the sqlite cache used for
faster access to metadata. Using this option will force yum
to download the sqlite metadata the next time it is run, or
recreate the sqlite metadata if using an older repo.</p>

<p>yum clean rpmdb Eliminate any cached data from the local
rpmdb.</p>

<p>yum clean plugins Tell any enabled plugins to eliminate
their cached data.</p>

<p>yum clean all Does all of the above.</p>

<p>PLUGINS Yum can be extended through the use of plugins.
A plugin is a Python &quot;.py&quot; file which is installed
in one of the directories specified by the pluginpath option
in yum.conf. For a plugin to work, the following conditions
must be met:</p>

<p>1. The plugin module file must be installed in the
plugin path as just described.</p>

<p>2. The global plugins option in /etc/yum.conf must be
set to 1.</p>

<p>3. A configuration file for the plugin must exist in
/etc/yum/plugin- conf.d/&lt;plugin_name&gt;.conf and the
enabled setting in this file must set to 1. The minimal
content for such a configuration file is:</p>

<p>[main] enabled = 1</p>

<p>See the yum.conf(5) man page for more information on
plugin related configuration options.</p>
