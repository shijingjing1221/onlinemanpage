<p>NAME struct_hrtimer - the basic hrtimer structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct hrtimer { struct rb_node node; ktime_t
_expires; ktime_t _softexpires; enum hrtimer_restart (*
function) (struct hrtimer *); struct hrtimer_clock_base *
base; unsigned long state; #ifdef CONFIG_TIMER_STATS int
start_pid; void * start_site; char start_comm[16]; #endif
};</p>

<p>MEMBERS node red black tree node for time ordered
insertion</p>

<p>_expires the absolute expiry time in the hrtimers
internal representation. The time is related to the clock on
which the timer is based. Is setup by adding slack to the
_softexpires value. For non range timers identical to
_softexpires.</p>

<p>_softexpires the absolute earliest expiry time of the
hrtimer. The time which was given as expiry time when the
timer was armed.</p>

<p>function timer expiry callback function</p>

<p>base pointer to the timer base (per cpu and per
clock)</p>

<p>state state information (See bit values above)</p>

<p>start_pid timer statistics field to store the pid of the
task which started the timer</p>

<p>start_site timer statistics field to store the site
where the timer was started</p>

<p>start_comm[16] timer statistics field to store the name
of the process which started the timer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The hrtimer structure must be initialized by
hrtimer_init</p>
