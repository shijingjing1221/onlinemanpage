<p>XtAddEventHandler(3) XT FUNCTIONS
XtAddEventHandler(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtAddEventHandler, XtAddRawEventHandler,
XtRemoveEventHandler, XtRemoveRawEventHandler,
XtInsertEventHandler, XtInsertRawEventHandler - add and
remove event handlers</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtAddEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask
event_mask, Boolean nonmask- able, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data);</p>

<p>void XtAddRawEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask
event_mask, Boolean non- maskable, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data);</p>

<p>void XtRemoveEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask
event_mask, Boolean non- maskable, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data);</p>

<p>void XtRemoveRawEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask
event_mask, Boolean nonmaskable, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data);</p>

<p>void XtInsertEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask
event_mask, Boolean non- maskable, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data, XtListPo- sition position);</p>

<p>void XtInsertRawEventHandler(Widget w, EventMask
event_mask, Boolean nonmaskable, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data, XtList- Position position);</p>

<p>typedef enum { XtListHead, XtListTail }
XtListPosition;</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS client_data Specifies additional data to be
passed to the clients event handler.</p>

<p>event_mask Specifies the event mask for which to call or
unregister this procedure.</p>

<p>nonmaskable Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether this proce- dure should be called or removed on the
nonmaskable events (GraphicsExpose, NoExpose,
SelectionClear, SelectionRequest, SelectionNotify,
ClientMessage, and MappingNotify).</p>

<p>proc Specifies the procedure that is to be added or
removed.</p>

<p>w Specifies the widget for which this event handler is
being registered.</p>

<p>position Specifies when the event handler is to be
called relative to other previously registered handlers.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtAddEventHandler function registers a
procedure with the dispatch mechanism that is to be called
when an event that matches the mask occurs on the specified
widget. If the procedure is already registered with the same
client_data, the specified mask is ORed into the existing
mask. If the widget is realized, XtAddEventHandler calls
XSelectInput, if necessary.</p>

<p>The XtAddRawEventHandler function is similar to
XtAddEventHandler except that it does not affect the widgets
mask and never causes an XSelectInput for its events. Note
that the widget might already have those mask bits set
because of other nonraw event handlers registered on it.</p>

<p>The XtRemoveRawEventHandler function stops the specified
procedure from receiving the specified events. Because the
procedure is a raw event handler, this does not affect the
widgets mask and never causes a call on XSelectInput.</p>

<p>XtInsertEventHandler is identical to XtAddEventHandler
with the addi- tional position argument. if position is
XtListHead, the event handler is registered to that it will
be called before any event handlers that were previously
registered for the same widget. If position is XtList- Tail,
the event handler is registered to be called after any
previously registered event handlers. If the procedure is
already registered with the same client_data value, the
specified mask augments the existing mask and the procedure
is repositioned in the list.</p>

<p>XtInsertRawEventHandler is similar to
XtInsertEventHandler except that it does not modify the
widgets event mask and never causes an XSelect- Input for
the specified events. If the procedure is already registered
with the same client_data value, the specified mask augments
the exist- ing mask and the procedure is repositioned in the
list.</p>
