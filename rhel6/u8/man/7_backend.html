<p>NAME backend - cups backend transmission interfaces</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS backend backend job user title num-copies
options [ filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Backends are a special type of filter(7)
which is used to send print data to and discover different
devices on the system.</p>

<p>Like filters, backends must be capable of reading from a
filename on the command-line or from the standard input,
copying the standard input to a temporary file as required
by the physical interface.</p>

<p>The command name (argv[0]) is set to the device URI of
the destination printer. Starting with CUPS 1.1.22, any
authentication information in argv[0] is removed, so backend
developers are urged to use the DEVICE_URI environment
variable whenever authentication information is required.
The CUPS API includes a cupsBackendDeviceURI function for
retrieving the correct device URI.</p>

<p>Back-channel data from the device should be relayed to
the job filters by writing to file descriptor 3. The CUPS
API includes the cups- BackChannelWrite function for this
purpose.</p>

<p>DEVICE DISCOVERY When run with no arguments, the backend
should list the devices and schemes it supports or is
advertising to stdout. The output consists of zero or more
lines consisting of any of the following forms:</p>

<p>device-class scheme &quot;Unknown&quot;
&quot;device-info&quot; device-class device-uri
&quot;device-make-and-model&quot; &quot;device-info&quot;
device-class device-uri &quot;device-make-and-model&quot;
&quot;device-info&quot; &quot;device-id&quot; device-class
device-uri &quot;device-make-and-model&quot;
&quot;device-info&quot; &quot;device-id&quot;
&quot;device-location&quot;</p>

<p>The device-class field is one of the following
values:</p>

<p>direct The device-uri refers to a specific direct-access
device with no options, such as a parallel, USB, or SCSI
device.</p>

<p>file The device-uri refers to a file on disk.</p>

<p>network The device-uri refers to a networked device and
conforms to the general form for network URIs.</p>

<p>serial The device-uri refers to a serial device with
configurable baud rate and other options. If the device-uri
contains a baud value, it represents the maximum baud rate
supported by the device.</p>

<p>The scheme field provides the URI scheme that is
supported by the back- end. Backends should use this form
only when the backend supports any URI using that scheme.
The device-uri field specifies the full URI to use when
communicating with the device.</p>

<p>The device-make-and-model field specifies the make and
model of the device, e.g. &quot;Acme Foojet 2000&quot;. If
the make and model is not known, you must report
&quot;Unknown&quot;.</p>

<p>The device-info field specifies additional information
about the device. Typically this includes the make and model
along with the port number or network address, e.g.
&quot;Acme Foojet 2000 USB #1&quot;.</p>

<p>The optional device-id field specifies the IEEE-1284
device ID string for the device, which is used to select a
matching driver.</p>

<p>The optional device-location field specifies the
physical location of the device, which is often used to
pre-populate the printer-location attribute when adding a
printer.</p>

<p>PERMISSIONS Backends without world execute permissions
are run as the root user. Otherwise, the backend is run
using the unprivileged user account, typ- ically
&quot;lp&quot;.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES The following exit codes are defined for
backends; C API constants defined in the
&lt;cups/backend.h&gt; header file are defined in
parenthesis:</p>

<p>0 (CUPS_BACKEND_OK) The print file was successfully
transmitted to the device or remote server.</p>

<p>1 (CUPS_BACKEND_FAILED) The print file was not
successfully transmitted to the device or remote server. The
scheduler will respond to this by canceling the job,
retrying the job, or stopping the queue depending on the
state of the error-policy attribute.</p>

<p>2 (CUPS_BACKEND_AUTH_REQUIRED) The print file was not
successfully transmitted because valid authentication
information is required. The scheduler will respond to this
by holding the job and adding the authentication-required
job-reasons keyword.</p>

<p>3 (CUPS_BACKEND_HOLD) The print file was not
successfully transmitted because it cannot be printed at
this time. The scheduler will respond to this by holding the
job.</p>

<p>4 (CUPS_BACKEND_STOP) The print file was not
successfully transmitted because it cannot be printed at
this time. The scheduler will respond to this by stopping
the queue.</p>

<p>5 (CUPS_BACKEND_CANCEL) The print file was not
successfully transmitted because one or more attributes are
not supported. The scheduler will respond to this by
canceling the job.</p>

<p>All other exit code values are reserved.</p>
