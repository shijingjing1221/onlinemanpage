<p>NAME scl - Setup and run software from Software
Collection environment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scl &lt;action&gt; [&lt;collection1&gt;
&lt;collection2&gt; ...] &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>scl &lt;action&gt; &lt;collection1&gt;
[&lt;collection2&gt; ...] -- &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>scl {-l|--list}</p>

<p>scl register &lt;path&gt;</p>

<p>scl deregister &lt;collection&gt; [--force]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents scl, a program
which is an utility for run- ning software packaged as a
Software Collection.</p>

<p>scl utility allows to execute an application which is
not located in the filesystem root hierarchy but is present
in an alternative loca- tion. This application can still use
and benefit from software installed in the root filesystem.
In order to let an application be visible to the system one
has to use scl utility as an interface.</p>

<p>&lt;action&gt; is a script name to execute in a bash
environment before the application itself takes in executed.
Currently only enable scriptlet is mandatory which is needed
to update search paths, etc.</p>

<p>One can enable more Software Collections if needed and
therefore one can use multiple collections which are enabled
by the left-right order as present on scl command-line.</p>

<p>&lt;command&gt; marks specified Software Collections as
enabled. Executes the script, which is expected to set
proper environment. Executes the &lt;com- mand&gt;. Control
is returned back to the caller with the original envi-
ronment as soon as the command finishes. If &lt;command&gt;
is - (dash) then it is read from the standard input.</p>

<p>Note: if you use &lt;command&gt; consisting of multiple
arguments, you either need to use quotes or the -- command
separator. Everything that follows the separator will be
considered a command or its argument.</p>

<p>Note: some commands modify user environment in some way.
Those commands may potentially break SCLs, as their
activation also usually depends on env. modification as
well. Typical examples of such commands are su and sudo.
Every collection modifies the environment differently, thus
more details may be found in the documentation of the
particular col- lection.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l, --list Lists all installed Software
Collections on the system. If a collection name is specified
then list of installed packages belonging to the collection
is listed.</p>

<p>register &lt;path&gt; If &lt;path&gt; leads to valid SCL
file structure, scl will regis- ter that as a SCL.
&lt;path&gt; directory needs to contain enable scriptlet and
root directory, to be considered valid SCL. &lt;path&gt;
needs to be an absolute path to the collection loca-
tion.</p>

<p>deregister &lt;collection&gt; [--force]
&lt;collection&gt; will no longer be considered SCL. If the
&lt;col- lection&gt; was installed locally, then the use of
--force is needed.i</p>

<p>EXAMPLES scl enable example less --version runs command
less --version in the environment with collection example
enabled</p>

<p>scl enable foo bar bash runs bash instance with foo and
bar Software Collections enabled</p>

<p>cat my_command | scl enable baz - run set of commands
listed in my_command file in the environment with baz
Software Collection enabled</p>

<p>scl -l list all installed collections</p>

<p>scl -l example list all packages within example
collection scl register /foo/bar registers new collection
with a name bar</p>

<p>scl deregister bar --force forces the deregistration of
collection bar</p>
