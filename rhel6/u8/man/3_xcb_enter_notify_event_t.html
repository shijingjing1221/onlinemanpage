<p>NAME xcb_enter_notify_event_t - the pointer is in a
different window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Event datastructure typedef struct
xcb_enter_notify_event_t { uint8_t response_type; uint8_t
detail; uint16_t sequence; xcb_timestamp_t time;
xcb_window_t root; xcb_window_t event; xcb_window_t child;
int16_t root_x; int16_t root_y; int16_t event_x; int16_t
event_y; uint16_t state; uint8_t mode; uint8_t
same_screen_focus; } xcb_enter_notify_event_t;</p>

<p>EVENT FIELDS response_type The type of this event, in
this case XCB_ENTER_NOTIFY. This field is also present in

<p>child If the event window has subwindows and the final
pointer po- sition is in one of them, then child is set to
that subwin- dow, XCB_WINDOW_NONE otherwise.</p>

<p>root_x The pointer X coordinate relative to root s
origin at the time of the event.</p>

<p>root_y The pointer Y coordinate relative to roots origin
at the time of the event.</p>

<p>event_x If event is on the same screen as root, this is
the pointer X coordinate relative to the event windows
origin.</p>

<p>event_y If event is on the same screen as root, this is
the pointer Y coordinate relative to the event windows
origin.</p>
