<p>ipmilan(8) IPMI LAN to System Interface Converter
ipmilan(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipmilan - IPMI LAN to System Interface
Converter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipmilan [-c configfile] [-i ipmidevice] [-d]
[-n]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ipmilan daemon allows an IPMI system
interface using the OpenIPMI device driver to be accessed
using the IPMI 1.5 LAN protocol.</p>

<p>ipmilan supports the full authentication capabilities of
the IPMI LAN protocol.</p>

<p>ipmilan supports multiple IP addresses for
fault-tolerance. Note that messages coming in on an address
are always sent back out on the same address they came
in.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c config-file Set the configuration file to one
other than the default of /etc/ipmi_lan.conf</p>

<p>-n Stops the daemon from forking and detaching from the
con- trolling terminal. This is useful for running from
init.</p>

<p>-d Turns on debugging to standard output. You generally
have to use -n with this.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Configuration is accomplished through the
file /etc/ipmi_lan.conf. A file with another name or path
may be specified using the -c option.</p>

<p>The following fields are used in many commands:</p>

<p>boolean May be &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;,
&quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;.</p>

<p>priv An IPMI privilege level. This may be
&quot;callback&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;opera-
tor&quot;, or &quot;admin&quot;.</p>

<p>auth An IPMI authorization type. This may be
&quot;none&quot; for no authentica- tion,
&quot;straight&quot; for straight, in-the-clear password
authentication, &quot;md2&quot; for use MD2 message digest
authentication, or &quot;md5&quot; for using MD5 message
digest authentication.</p>

<p>addr IP-address [UDP-port] IP-address specifies the IP
address to use for an IP port. Up to 4 addresses may be
specified. If no address is specified, it defaults to one
port at 0.0.0.0 (for every address on the machine) at port
623.</p>

<p>UDP-port specifies an optional port to listen on. It
defaults to 623 (the standard port).</p>

<p>PEF_alerting boolean Turn PEF alerting on or off (not
currently supported).</p>

<p>per_msg_auth boolean Turn per-message authentication on
or off.</p>

<p>priv_limit priv The maximum privilege allowed on this
interface.</p>

<p>allowed_auths_callback [auth [auth [...]]] auth
specifies allowed authorization levels for the callback
privilege level. Only the levels specified on this line are
allowed for the authorization level. If this line is not
present, callback authorization cannot be used.</p>

<p>allowed_auths_user [auth [auth [...]]] auth specifies
allowed authorization levels for the user privi- lege level.
Only the levels specified on this line are allowed for the
authorization level. If this line is not present, user
authorization cannot be used.</p>

<p>allowed_auths_operator [auth [auth [...]]] auth
specifies allowed authorization levels for the operator
privilege level. Only the levels specified on this line are
allowed for the authorization level. If this line is not
present, operator authorization cannot be used.</p>

<p>allowed_auths_admin [auth [auth [...]]] auth specifies
allowed authorization levels for the admin privi- lege
level. Only the levels specified on this line are allowed
for the authorization level. If this line is not present,
user authorization cannot be used.</p>

<p>user usernum enabled username password max-priv
max-session [auth [auth [...]]] usernum specifies the user
number for the user. Note that user number 0 is invalid, and
user number 1 is the special &quot;anony- mous&quot; user,
whose username is ignored. This value may be up to 63, the
maximum possible IPMI user. If you want anonymous access,
you must have a user number 1.</p>

<p>enabled is a boolean that specified whether the user is
enabled or not.</p>

<p>username specifies the name of the user, specified as a
name.</p>

<p>password specifies the password of the user, specified
as a name.</p>

<p>max-priv specifies the maximum privilege level allowed
for the user.</p>

<p>max.sessions specifies the maximum number of session the
user may open.</p>

<p>auth specifies the allowed authorization types for the
user. Only the specified ones are allowed, so if none are
specified, the user will be disabled.</p>

<p>guid name Allows the 16-byte GUID for the IPMI LAN
connection to be speci- fied. If this is not specified, then
the GUID command is not supported.</p>

<p>Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.</p>

<p>SECURITY ipmilan implements normal IPMI security. The
default is no access for anyone, so the default is pretty
safe, but be careful what you add, because this is access to
control your box. straight and none autho- rizations are not
recommended, you should probably stick with md2 or md5.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGHUP ipmilan should handle SIGHUP and reread
it s configuration files. However, it doesn t right now. It
might in the future, for now you will have to kill it and
restart it. Clients should handle reconnecting in this case.
If they dont, they are broken.</p>

<p>ERROR OUTPUT At startup, all error output goes to
stderr. After that, all error output goes to syslog.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ipmi_lan.conf</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ipmi_ui(1)</p>

<p>KNOWN PROBLEMS Currently, ipmilan does not implement
writing the config file. IPMI commands to change
configuration options are accepted, but the perma- nent
writing of the changes does not currently work.</p>
