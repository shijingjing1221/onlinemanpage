<p>NAME lpadmin - configure cups printers and classes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lpadmin [ -E ] [-U username ] [ -h
server[:port] ] -d destination lpadmin [ -E ] [-U username ]
[ -h server[:port] ] -p printer option(s) lpadmin [ -E ] [-U
username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -x destination</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lpadmin configures printer and class queues
provided by CUPS. It can also be used to set the server
default printer or class.</p>

<p>When specified before the -d, -p, or -x options, the -E
option forces encryption when connecting to the server.</p>

<p>The first form of the command (-d) sets the default
printer or class to destination. Subsequent print jobs
submitted via the lp(1) or lpr(1) commands will use this
destination unless the user specifies otherwise with the
lpoptions(1) command.</p>

<p>The second form of the command (-p) configures the named
printer. The additional options are described below.</p>

<p>The third form of the command (-x) deletes the printer
or class desti- nation. Any jobs that are pending for the
destination will be removed and any job that is currently
printed will be aborted.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS The following options are
recognized when configuring a printer queue:</p>

<p>-c class Adds the named printer to class. If class does
not exist it is created automatically.</p>

<p>-i interface Sets a System V style interface script for
the printer. This option cannot be specified with the -P
option (PPD file) and is intended for providing support for
legacy printer drivers.</p>

<p>-m model Sets a standard System V interface script or
PPD file from the model directory.</p>

<p>-o job-k-limit=value Sets the kilobyte limit for
per-user quotas. The value is an inte- ger number of
kilobytes; one kilobyte is 1024 bytes.</p>

<p>-o job-page-limit=value Sets the page limit for per-user
quotas. The value is the integer number of pages that can be
printed; double-sided pages are counted as two pages.</p>

<p>-o job-quota-period=value Sets the accounting period for
per-user quotas. The value is an integer number of seconds;
86,400 seconds are in one day.</p>

<p>-o job-sheets-default=banner</p>

<p>-o job-sheets-default=banner,banner Sets the default
banner page(s) to use for print jobs.</p>

<p>-o name=value Sets a PPD option for the printer. PPD
options can be listed using the -l option with the
lpoptions(1) command.</p>

<p>-o name-default=value Sets a default server-side option
for the printer. Any print-time option can be defaulted,
e.g. &quot;-o cpi-default=17&quot; to set the default
&quot;cpi&quot; option value to 17.</p>

<p>-o port-monitor=name Sets the binary communications
program to use when printing, &quot;none&quot;,
&quot;bcp&quot;, or &quot;tbcp&quot;. The default program is
&quot;none&quot;. The spec- ified port monitor must be
listed in the printers PPD file.</p>

<p>-o printer-error-policy=name Sets the error policy to be
used when the printer backend is unable to send the job to
the printer. The name must be one of &quot;abort-job&quot;,
&quot;retry-job&quot; or &quot;stop-printer&quot;. The
default error pol- icy is &quot;stop-printer&quot;.</p>

<p>-o printer-is-shared=true/false Sets the printer to
shared/published or unshared/unpublished. Shared/published
printers are publically announced by the server on the LAN
based on the browsing configuration in cupsd.conf, while
unshared/unpublished printers are not announced. The default
value is &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p>-o printer-op-policy=name Sets the IPP operation policy
associated with the printer. The name must be defined in the
cupsd.conf in a Policy section. The default operation policy
is &quot;default&quot;.</p>

<p>-r class Removes the named printer from class. If the
resulting class becomes empty it is removed.</p>

<p>-u allow:user,user,@group</p>

<p>-u deny:user,user,@group</p>

<p>-u allow:all</p>

<p>-u deny:none Sets user-level access control on a
printer. Names starting with &quot;@&quot; are interpreted
as UNIX groups. The latter two forms turn user-level access
control off.</p>

<p>-v &quot;device-uri&quot; Sets the device-uri attribute
of the printer queue. If device-uri is a filename it is
automatically converted to the form file:///file/name. Use
the lpinfo(8) command to get a list of sup- ported device
URIs and schemes.</p>

<p>-D &quot;info&quot; Provides a textual description of
the printer.</p>

<p>-E Enables the printer and accepts jobs; this is the
same as running the cupsaccept(8) and cupsenable(8) programs
on the printer.</p>

<p>-L &quot;location&quot; Provides a textual location of
the printer.</p>

<p>-P ppd-file Specifies a PostScript Printer Description
file to use with the printer. If specified, this option
overrides the -i option (inter- face script).</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS
allows printer names to con- tain any printable character
except SPACE, TAB, &quot;/&quot;, or &quot;#&quot;. Also,
printer and class names are not case-sensitive. Finally, the
CUPS ver- sion of lpadmin may ask the user for an access
password depending on the printing system configuration.
This differs from the System V ver- sion which requires the
root user to execute this command.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The CUPS version of lpadmin does not support
all of the System V or Solaris printing system configuration
options.</p>
