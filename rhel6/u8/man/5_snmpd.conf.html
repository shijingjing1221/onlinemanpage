<p>SNMPD.CONF(5) Net-SNMP SNMPD.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME snmpd.conf - configuration file for the Net-SNMP
SNMP agent</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Net-SNMP agent uses one or more
configuration files to control its operation and the
management information provided. These files (snmpd.conf and
snmpd.local.conf) can be located in one of several
locations, as described in the snmp_config(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>The (perl) application snmpconf can be used to generate
configuration files for the most common agent requirements.
See the snmpconf(1) man- ual page for more information, or
try running the command:</p>

<p>snmpconf -g basic_setup</p>

<p>There are a large number of directives that can be
specified, but these mostly fall into four distinct
categories:</p>

<p>&middot; those controlling who can access the agent</p>

<p>&middot; those configuring the information that is
supplied by the agent</p>

<p>&middot; those controlling active monitoring of the
local system</p>

<p>&middot; those concerned with extending the
functionality of the agent.</p>

<p>Some directives dont fall naturally into any of these
four categories, but this covers the majority of the
contents of a typical snmpd.conf file. A full list of
recognised directives can be obtained by running the
command:</p>

<p>snmpd -H</p>

<p>AGENT BEHAVIOUR Although most configuration directives
are concerned with the MIB information supplied by the
agent, there are a handful of directives that control the
behaviour of snmpd considered simply as a daemon pro- viding
a network service.</p>

<p>agentaddress
[&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;[,...]
defines a list of listening addresses, on which to receive
incoming SNMP requests. See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES
in the snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the
format of listening addresses.</p>

<p>The default behaviour is to listen on UDP port 161 on
all IPv4 interfaces.</p>

<p>agentgroup {GROUP|#GID} changes to the specified group
after opening the listening port(s). This may refer to a
group by name (GROUP), or a numeric group ID starting with #
(#GID).</p>

<p>agentuser {USER|#UID} changes to the specified user
after opening the listening port(s). This may refer to a
user by name (USER), or a numeric user ID starting with #
(#UID).</p>

<p>leave_pidfile yes instructs the agent to not remove its
pid file on shutdown. Equivalent to specifying
&quot;-U&quot; on the command line.</p>

<p>maxGetbulkRepeats NUM Sets the maximum number of
responses allowed for a single vari- able in a getbulk
request. Set to 0 to enable the default and set it to -1 to
enable unlimited. Because memory is allocated ahead of time,
sitting this to unlimited is not considered safe if your
user population can not be trusted. A repeat number greater
than this will be truncated to this value.</p>

<p>This is set by default to -1.</p>

<p>maxGetbulkResponses NUM Sets the maximum number of
responses allowed for a getbulk request. This is set by
default to 100. Set to 0 to enable the default and set it to
-1 to enable unlimited. Because memory is allocated ahead of
time, sitting this to unlimited is not con- sidered safe if
your user population can not be trusted.</p>

<p>In general, the total number of responses will not be
allowed to exceed the maxGetbulkResponses number and the
total number returned will be an integer multiple of the
number of variables requested times the calculated number of
repeats allow to fit below this number.</p>

<p>Also not that processing of maxGetbulkRepeats is handled
first.</p>

<p>SNMPv3 Configuration SNMPv3 requires an SNMP agent to
define a unique &quot;engine ID&quot; in order to respond to
SNMPv3 requests. This ID will normally be determined
automatically, using two reasonably non-predictable values -
a (pseudo-)random number and the current time in seconds.
This is the recommended approach. However the capacity
exists to define the engineID in other ways:</p>

<p>engineID STRING specifies that the engineID should be
built from the given text STRING.</p>

<p>engineIDType 1|2|3 specifies that the engineID should be
built from the IPv4 address (1), IPv6 address (2) or MAC
address (3). Note that changing the IP address (or switching
the network interface card) may cause problems.</p>

<p>engineIDNic INTERFACE defines which interface to use
when determining the MAC address. If engineIDType 3 is not
specified, then this directive has no effect.</p>

<p>The default is to use eth0.</p>

<p>SNMPv3 AUTHENTICATION SNMPv3 was originally defined
using the User-Based Security Model (USM), which contains a
private list of users and keys specific to the SNMPv3
protocol. The operational community, however, declared it a
pain to manipulate yet another database and would prefer to
use exist- ing infrastructure. To that end the IETF created
the ISMS working group to battle that problem, and the ISMS
working group decided to tunnel SNMP over SSH and DTLS to
make use existing user and authentica- tion
infrastructures.</p>

<p>SNMPv3 USM Users To use the USM based SNMPv3-specific
users, youll need to create them. It is recommended you use
the net-snmp-config command to do this, but you can also do
it by directly specifying createUser directives your- self
instead:</p>

<p>createUser [-e ENGINEID] username (MD5|SHA)
authpassphrase [DES|AES] [privpassphrase]</p>

<p>MD5 and SHA are the authentication types to use. DES and
AES are the privacy protocols to use. If the privacy
passphrase is not specified, it is assumed to be the same as
the authentica- tion passphrase. Note that the users created
will be useless unless they are also added to the VACM
access control tables described above.</p>

<p>SHA authentication and DES/AES privacy require OpenSSL
to be installed and the agent to be built with OpenSSL
support. MD5 authentication may be used without OpenSSL.</p>

<p>Warning: the minimum pass phrase length is 8
characters.</p>

<p>SNMPv3 users can be created at runtime using the
snmpusm(1) com- mand.</p>

<p>Instead of figuring out how to use this directive and
where to put it (see below), just run &quot;net-snmp-config
--create- snmpv3-user&quot; instead, which will add one of
these lines to the right place.</p>

<p>This directive should be placed into the /var/lib/net-
snmp/snmpd.conf file instead of the other normal locations.
The reason is that the information is read from the file and
then the line is removed (eliminating the storage of the
master pass- word for that user) and replaced with the key
that is derived from it. This key is a localized key, so
that if it is stolen it can not be used to access other
agents. If the password is stolen, however, it can be.</p>

<p>If you need to localize the user to a particular
EngineID (this is useful mostly in the similar
snmptrapd.conf file), you can use the -e argument to specify
an EngineID as a hex value (EG, &quot;0x01020304&quot;).</p>

<p>If you want to generate either your master or localized
keys directly, replace the given password with a hexstring
(preceeded by a &quot;0x&quot;) and precede the hex string
by a -m or -l token (respectively). EGs:</p>

<p>[these keys are *not* secure but are easy to visually
parse for counting purposes. Please generate random keys
instead of using these examples]</p>

<p>createUser myuser SHA -l
0x0001020304050607080900010203040506070809 AES -l
0x00010203040506070809000102030405 createUser myuser SHA -m
0x0001020304050607080900010203040506070809 AES -m
0x0001020304050607080900010203040506070809</p>

<p>Due to the way localization happens, localized privacy
keys are expected to be the length needed by the algorithm
(128 bits for all supported algorithms). Master encryption
keys, though, need to be the length required by the
authentication algorithm not the length required by the
encrypting algorithm (MD5: 16 bytes, SHA: 20 bytes).</p>

<p>SSH Support To use SSH, you ll need to configure sshd to
invoke sshtosnmp as well as configure the access control
settings to allow access through the tsm security model
using the user name provided to snmpd by the ssh
transport.</p>

<p>DTLS Support For DTLS, snmpd will need to be configured
with it s own X.509 certifi- cate as well as the
certificates of the client users to be allowed to connect to
the agent. The access control will need to be set up as well
to allow access through the tsm security model. The
CommonName of the Subject from the X.509 certificate will be
passed to snmpd as the SNMPv3 username to use. See the
http://www.net- snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Using_DTLS web page
for more detailed instruc- tions for setting up DTLS.</p>

<p>defX509ServerPub FILE</p>

<p>defX509ServerPriv FILE These two directives specify the
public and private key files for the certificate that snmpd
should present to incoming con- nections.</p>

<p>defX509ClientCerts FILE This directive specifies a file
containing all of the public keys (or CAs of public keys)
for clients to connect the server with.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL snmpd supports the View-Based Access
Control Model (VACM) as defined in RFC 2575, to control who
can retrieve or update information. To this end, it
recognizes various directives relating to access
control.</p>

<p>Traditional Access Control Most simple access control
requirements can be specified using the directives
rouser/rwuser (for SNMPv3) or rocommunity/rwcommunity (for
SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c).</p>

<p>rouser [-s SECMODEL] USER [noauth|auth|priv [OID | -V
VIEW [CONTEXT]]]</p>

<p>rwuser [-s SECMODEL] USER [noauth|auth|priv [OID | -V
VIEW [CONTEXT]]] specify an SNMPv3 user that will be allowed
read-only (GET and GETNEXT) or read-write (GET, GETNEXT and
SET) access respec- tively. By default, this will provide
access to the full OID tree for authenticated (including
encrypted) SNMPv3 requests, using the default context. An
alternative minimum security level can be specified using
noauth (to allow unauthenticated requests), or priv (to
enforce use of encryption). The OID field restricts access
for that user to the subtree rooted at the given OID, or the
named view. An optional context can also be specified, or
&quot;context*&quot; to denote a context prefix. If no
context field is specified (or the token &quot;*&quot; is
used), the directive will match all possible contexts.</p>

<p>If SECMODEL is specified then it will be the security
model required for that user (note that identical user names
may come in over different security models and will be
appropriately sep- arated via the access control settings).
The default security model is &quot;usm&quot; and the other
common security models are likely &quot;tsm&quot; when using
SSH or DTLS support and &quot;ksm&quot; if the Kerberos
support has been compiled in.</p>

<p>rocommunity COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW
[CONTEXT]]]</p>

<p>rwcommunity COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW [CONTEXT]]]
specify an SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community that will be allowed
read-only (GET and GETNEXT) or read-write (GET, GETNEXT and
SET) access respectively. By default, this will provide
access to the full OID tree for such requests, regardless of
where they were sent from. The SOURCE token can be used to
restrict access to requests from the specified system(s) -
see com2sec for the full details. The OID field restricts
access for that community to the subtree rooted at the given
OID, or named view. Contexts are typically less relevant to
community-based SNMP versions, but the same behaviour
applies here.</p>

<p>rocommunity6 COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW
[CONTEXT]]]</p>

<p>rwcommunity6 COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW
[CONTEXT]]] are directives relating to requests received
using IPv6 (if the agent supports such transport domains).
The interpretation of the SOURCE, OID, VIEW and CONTEXT
tokens are exactly the same as for the IPv4 versions.</p>

<p>In each case, only one directive should be specified for
a given SNMPv3 user, or community string. It is not
appropriate to specify both rouser and rwuser directives
referring to the same SNMPv3 user (or equivalent community
settings). The rwuser directive provides all the access of
rouser (as well as allowing SET support). The same holds
true for the community-based directives.</p>

<p>More complex access requirements (such as access to two
or more dis- tinct OID subtrees, or different views for GET
and SET requests) should use one of the other access control
mechanisms. Note that if several distinct communities or
SNMPv3 users need to be granted the same level of access, it
would also be more efficient to use the main VACM config-
uration directives.</p>

<p>VACM Configuration The full flexibility of the VACM is
available using four configuration directives - com2sec,
group, view and access. These provide direct configuration
of the underlying VACM tables.</p>

<p>com2sec [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOURCE COMMUNITY</p>

<p>com2sec6 [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOURCE COMMUNITY map an
SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string to a security name -
either from a particular range of source addresses, or
globally (&quot;default&quot;). A restricted source can
either be a specific host- name (or address), or a subnet -
represented as IP/MASK (e.g. 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0), or
IP/BITS (e.g. 10.10.10.0/24), or the IPv6 equivalents.</p>

<p>The same community string can be specified in several
separate directives (presumably with different source
tokens), and the first source/community combination that
matches the incoming request will be selected. Various
source/community combinations can also map to the same
security name.</p>

<p>If a CONTEXT is specified (using -Cn), the community
string will be mapped to a security name in the named SNMPv3
context. Other- wise the default context (&quot;&quot;) will
be used.</p>

<p>com2secunix [-Cn CONTEXT] SECNAME SOCKPATH COMMUNITY is
the Unix domain sockets version of com2sec.</p>

<p>group GROUP {v1|v2c|usm|tsm|ksm} SECNAME maps a security
name (in the specified security model) into a named group.
Several group directives can specify the same group name,
allowing a single access setting to apply to several users
and/or community strings.</p>

<p>Note that groups must be set up for the two
community-based mod- els separately - a single com2sec (or
equivalent) directive will typically be accompanied by two
group directives.</p>

<p>view VNAME TYPE OID [MASK] defines a named
&quot;view&quot; - a subset of the overall OID tree. This is
most commonly a single subtree, but several view directives
can be given with the same view name (VNAME), to build up a
more complex collection of OIDs. TYPE is either included or
excluded, which can again define a more complex view (e.g by
excluding certain sensitive objects from an otherwise
accessible subtree).</p>

<p>MASK is a list of hex octets (optionally separated by .
or : ) with the set bits indicating which subidentifiers in
the view OID to match against. If not specified, this
defaults to matching the OID exactly (all bits set), thus
defining a simple OID subtree. So: view iso1 included .iso
0xf0 view iso2 included .iso view iso3 included
.iso.org.dod.mgmt 0xf0</p>

<p>would all define the same view, covering the whole of
the iso(1) subtree (with the third example ignoring the
subidenti- fiers not covered by the mask).</p>

<p>More usefully, the mask can be used to define a view
covering a particular row (or rows) in a table, by matching
against the appropriate table index value, but skipping the
column subiden- tifier:</p>

<p>view ifRow4 included .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.0.4 0xff:a0</p>

<p>Note that a mask longer than 8 bits must use : to
separate the individual octets.</p>

<p>access GROUP CONTEXT {any|v1|v2c|usm|tsm|ksm} LEVEL
PREFX READ WRITE NOTIFY maps from a group of
users/communities (with a particular secu- rity model and
minimum security level, and in a specific con- text) to one
of three views, depending on the request being pro-
cessed.</p>

<p>LEVEL is one of noauth, auth, or priv. PREFX specifies
how CON- TEXT should be matched against the context of the
incoming request, either exact or prefix. READ, WRITE and
NOTIFY speci- fies the view to be used for GET*, SET and
TRAP/INFORM requests (althought the NOTIFY view is not
currently used). For v1 or v2c access, LEVEL will need to be
noauth.</p>

<p>Typed-View Configuration The final group of directives
extend the VACM approach into a more flexible mechanism,
which can be applied to other access control requirements.
Rather than the fixed three views of the standard VACM
mechanism, this can be used to configure various different
view types. As far as the main SNMP agent is concerned, the
two main view types are read and write, corresponding to the
READ and WRITE views of the main access directive. See the
snmptrapd.conf(5) man page for discussion of other view
types.</p>

<p>authcommunity TYPES COMMUNITY [SOURCE [OID | -V VIEW
[CONTEXT]]] is an alternative to the rocommunity/rwcommunity
directives. TYPES will usually be read or read,write
respectively. The view specification can either be an OID
subtree (as before), or a named view (defined using the view
directive) for greater flexi- bility. If this is omitted,
then access will be allowed to the full OID tree. If CONTEXT
is specified, access is configured within this SNMPv3
context. Otherwise the default context (&quot;&quot;) is
used.</p>

<p>authuser TYPES [-s MODEL] USER [LEVEL [OID | -V VIEW
[CONTEXT]]] is an alternative to the rouser/rwuser
directives. The fields TYPES, OID, VIEW and CONTEXT have the
same meaning as for auth- community.</p>

<p>authgroup TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP [LEVEL [OID | -V VIEW
[CONTEXT]]] is a companion to the authuser directive,
specifying access for a particular group (defined using the
group directive as usual). Both authuser and authgroup
default to authenticated requests - LEVEL can also be
specified as noauth or priv to allow unauthen- ticated
requests, or require encryption respectively. Both authuser
and authgroup directives also default to configuring access
for SNMPv3/USM requests - use the -s flag to specify an
alternative security model (using the same values as for
access above).</p>

<p>authaccess TYPES [-s MODEL] GROUP VIEW [LEVEL [CONTEXT]]
also configures the access for a particular group,
specifying the name and type of view to apply. The MODEL and
LEVEL fields are interpreted in the same way as for
authgroup. If CONTEXT is specified, access is configured
within this SNMPv3 context (or contexts with this prefix if
the CONTEXT field ends with *). Otherwise the default
context (&quot;&quot;) is used.</p>

<p>setaccess GROUP CONTEXT MODEL LEVEL PREFIX VIEW TYPES is
a direct equivalent to the original access directive, typi-
cally listing the view types as read or read,write as
appropri- ate. (or see snmptrapd.conf(5) for other
possibilities). All other fields have the same
interpretation as with access.</p>

<p>SYSTEM INFORMATION Most of the information reported by
the Net-SNMP agent is retrieved from the underlying system,
or dynamically configured via SNMP SET requests (and
retained from one run of the agent to the next). How- ever,
certain MIB objects can be configured or controlled via the
snmpd.conf(5) file.</p>

<p>System Group Most of the scalar objects in the system
group can be configured in this way:</p>

<p>sysLocation STRING</p>

<p>sysContact STRING</p>

<p>sysName STRING set the system location, system contact
or system name (sysLoca- tion.0, sysContact.0 and sysName.0)
for the agent respectively. Ordinarily these objects are
writeable via suitably authorized SNMP SET requests.
However, specifying one of these directives makes the
corresponding object read-only, and attempts to SET it will
result in a notWritable error response.</p>

<p>sysServices NUMBER sets the value of the sysServices.0
object. For a host system, a good value is 72 (application +
end-to-end layers). If this directive is not specified, then
no value will be reported for the sysServices.0 object.</p>

<p>sysDescr STRING</p>

<p>sysObjectID OID sets the system description or object ID
for the agent. Although these MIB objects are not
SNMP-writable, these direc- tives can be used by a network
administrator to configure suit- able values for them.</p>

<p>Interfaces Group interface NAME TYPE SPEED can be used
to provide appropriate type and speed settings for
interfaces where the agent fails to determine this
information correctly. TYPE is a type value as given in the
IANAifType-MIB, and can be specified numerically or by name
(assuming this MIB is loaded).</p>

<p>interface_fadeout TIMEOUT specifies, for how long the
agent keeps entries in ifTable after appropriate interfaces
have been removed from system (typically various ppp, tap or
tun interfaces). Timeout value is in sec- onds. Default
value is 300 (=5 minutes).</p>

<p>interface_replace_old yes can be used to remove already
existing entries in ifTable when an interface with the same
name appears on the system. E.g. when ppp0 interface is
removed, it is still listed in the table for
interface_fadeout seconds. This option ensures, that the old
ppp0 interface is removed even before the interface_fadeout
timeour when new ppp0 (with different ifIndex) shows up.</p>

<p>Host Resources Group This requires that the agent was
built with support for the host module (which is now
included as part of the default build configuration on the
major supported platforms).</p>

<p>ignoreDisk STRING controls which disk devices are
scanned as part of populating the hrDiskStorageTable (and
hrDeviceTable). The HostRes imple- mentation code includes a
list of disk device patterns appropri- ate for the current
operating system, some of which may cause the agent to block
when trying to open the corresponding disk devices. This
might lead to a timeout when walking these tables, possibly
resulting in inconsistent behaviour. This directive can be
used to specify particular devices (either individually or
wildcarded) that should not be checked.</p>

<p>Note: Please consult the source (host/hr_disk.c) and
check for the Add_HR_Disk_entry calls relevant for a
particular O/S to determine the list of devices that will be
scanned.</p>

<p>The pattern can include one or more wildcard
expressions. See snmpd.examples(5) for illustration of the
wildcard syntax.</p>

<p>skipNFSInHostResources true controls whether NFS and
NFS-like file systems should be omitted from the
hrStorageTable (true or 1) or not (false or 0, which is the
default). If the Net-SNMP agent gets hung on NFS-mounted
filesystems, you can try setting this to 1.</p>

<p>storageUseNFS [1|2] controls how NFS and NFS-like file
systems should be reported in the hrStorageTable. as Network
Disks (1) or Fixed Disks (2) Historically, the Net-SNMP
agent has reported such file systems as Fixed Disks, and
this is still the default behaviour. Set- ting this
directive to 1 reports such file systems as &acute;Network
Disks, as required by the Host Resources MIB.</p>

<p>realStorageUnits controlls how the agent reports
hrStorageAllocationUnits, hrStorageSize and hrStorageUsed in
hrStorageTable. With this option set to 0 , the agent
re-calculates these values for big storage drives with small
allocation units so hrStorageAlloca- tionUnits x
hrStorageSize gives real size of the storage.</p>

<p>Example: Linux xfs 16TB filesystem with 4096 bytes large
blocks will be reported as hrStorageAllocationUnits = 8192
and hrStorageSize = 2147483647, so 8192 x 2147483647 gives
real size of the filesystem (=16 TB).</p>

<p>Setting this directive to 1 (=default) turns off this
calcula- tion and the agent reports real
hrStorageAllocationUnits, but it might report wrong
hrStorageSize for big drives because the value won t fit
into Integer32. In this case, hrStorageAlloca- tionUnits x
hrStorageSize wont give real size of the storage.</p>

<p>Process Monitoring The hrSWRun group of the Host
Resources MIB provides information about individual
processes running on the local system. The prTable of the
UCD-SNMP-MIB complements this by reporting on selected
services (which may involve multiple processes). This
requires that the agent was built with support for the
ucd-snmp/proc module (which is included as part of the
default build configuration).</p>

<p>proc NAME [MAX [MIN]] monitors the number of processes
called NAME (as reported by &quot;/bin/ps -e&quot;) running
on the local system.</p>

<p>If the number of NAMEd processes is less than MIN or
greater than MAX, then the corresponding prErrorFlag
instance will be set to 1, and a suitable description
message reported via the prErrMessage instance.</p>

<p>Note: This situation will not automatically trigger a
trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB
section later.</p>

<p>If neither MAX nor MIN are specified (or are both 0),
they will default to infinity and 1 respectively (&quot;at
least one&quot;). If only MAX is specified, MIN will default
to 0 (&quot;no more than MAX&quot;).</p>

<p>procfix NAME PROG ARGS registers a command that can be
run to fix errors with the given process NAME. This will be
invoked when the corresponding prE- rrFix instance is set to
1.</p>

<p>Note: This command will not be invoked
automatically.</p>

<p>The procfix directive must be specified after the
matching proc directive, and cannot be used on its own.</p>

<p>If no proc directives are defined, then walking the
prTable will fail (noSuchObject).</p>

<p>Disk Usage Monitoring This requires that the agent was
built with support for the ucd- snmp/disk module (which is
included as part of the default build con- figuration).</p>

<p>disk PATH [ MINSPACE | MINPERCENT% ] monitors the disk
mounted at PATH for available disk space. Disks mounted
after the agent has started will not be monitored, unless
includeAllDisks option is specified.</p>

<p>The minimum threshold can either be specified in kB
(MINSPACE) or as a percentage of the total disk (MINPERCENT%
with a % character), defaulting to 100kB if neither are
specified. If the free disk space falls below this
threshold, then the corre- sponding dskErrorFlag instance
will be set to 1, and a suitable description message
reported via the dskErrorMsg instance.</p>

<p>Note: This situation will not automatically trigger a
trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB
section later.</p>

<p>includeAllDisks MINPERCENT% configures monitoring of all
disks found on the system, using the specified (percentage)
threshold. The dskTable is dynami- cally updated, unmounted
disks disappear from the table and newly mounted disks are
added to the table. The threshold for individual disks can
be adjusted using suitable disk directives (which can come
either before or after the includeAllDisks directive).</p>

<p>Note: Whether disk directives appears before or after
includeAllDisks may affect the indexing of the dskTable.</p>

<p>Only one includeAllDisks directive should be specified -
any subsequent copies will be ignored.</p>

<p>The list of mounted disks will be determined from HOST-
RESOURCES-MIB::hrFSTable.</p>

<p>If neither any disk directives or includeAllDisks are
defined, then walking the dskTable will fail
(noSuchObject).</p>

<p>Disk I/O Monitoring This requires that the agent was
built with support for the ucd-snmp/diskio module (which is
not included as part of the default build
configuration).</p>

<p>By default, all block devices known to the operating
system are included in the diskIOTable. On platforms other
than Linux, this module has no configuration directives.</p>

<p>On Linux systems, it is possible to report only
explicitly whitelisted devices. It may take significant
amount of time to process diskIOTable data on systems with
tens of thousands of block devices and whitelist- ing only
the important ones avoids large CPU consumption.</p>

<p>diskio &lt;device&gt; Enables whitelisting of devices
and adds the device to the whitelist. Only explicitly
whitelisted devices will be reported. This option may be
used multiple times.</p>

<p>System Load Monitoring This requires that the agent was
built with support for either the ucd- snmp/loadave module
or the ucd-snmp/memory module respectively (both of which
are included as part of the default build
configuration).</p>

<p>load MAX1 [MAX5 [MAX15]] monitors the load average of
the local system, specifying thresholds for the 1-minute,
5-minute and 15-minute averages. If any of these loads
exceed the associated maximum value, then the corresponding
laErrorFlag instance will be set to 1, and a suitable
description message reported via the laErrMessage
instance.</p>

<p>Note: This situation will not automatically trigger a
trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB
section later.</p>

<p>If the MAX15 threshold is omitted, it will default to
the MAX5 value. If both MAX5 and MAX15 are omitted, they
will default to the MAX1 value. If this directive is not
specified, all three thresholds will default to a value of
DEFMAXLOADAVE.</p>

<p>If a threshold value of 0 is given, the agent will not
report errors via the relevant laErrorFlag or laErrMessage
instances, regardless of the current load.</p>

<p>Unlike the proc and disk directives, walking the walking
the laTable will succeed (assuming the ucd-snmp/loadave
module was configured into the agent), even if the load
directive is not present.</p>

<p>swap MIN monitors the amount of swap space available on
the local system. If this falls below the specified
threshold (MIN kB), then the memErrorSwap object will be set
to 1, and a suitable description message reported via
memSwapErrorMsg.</p>

<p>Note: This situation will not automatically trigger a
trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB
section later. If this directive is not specified, the
default threshold is 16 MB.</p>

<p>Log File Monitoring This requires that the agent was
built with support for either the ucd- snmp/file or
ucd-snmp/logmatch modules respectively (both of which are
included as part of the default build configuration).</p>

<p>file FILE [MAXSIZE] monitors the size of the specified
file (in kB). If MAXSIZE is specified, and the size of the
file exceeds this threshold, then the corresponding
fileErrorFlag instance will be set to 1, and a suitable
description message reported via the fileErrorMsg
instance.</p>

<p>Note: This situation will not automatically trigger a
trap to report the problem - see the DisMan Event MIB
section later.</p>

<p>Note: A maximum of 20 files can be monitored.</p>

<p>Note: If no file directives are defined, then walking
the fileTable will fail (noSuchObject).</p>

<p>logmatch NAME FILE CYCLETIME REGEX monitors the
specified file for occurances of the specified pat- tern
REGEX. The file position is stored internally so the entire
file is only read initially, every subsequent pass will only
read the new lines added to the file since the last
read.</p>

<p>NAME name of the logmatch instance (will appear as
logMatch- Name under
logMatch/logMatchTable/logMatchEntry/logMatch- Name in the
ucd-snmp MIB tree)</p>

<p>FILE absolute path to the logfile to be monitored. Note
that this path can contain date/time directives (like in the
UNIX date command). See the manual page for strftime for the
various directives accepted.</p>

<p>CYCLETIME time interval for each logfile read and
internal variable update in seconds. Note: an SNMPGET*
operation will also trigger an immediate logfile read and
variable update.</p>

<p>REGEX the regular expression to be used. Note: DO NOT
enclose the regular expression in quotes even if there are
spaces in the expression as the quotes will also become part
of the pattern to be matched!</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>logmatch apache-GETs
/usr/local/apache/logs/access.log-%Y-%m-%d 60
GET.*HTTP.*</p>

<p>This logmatch instance is named apache-GETs, uses
GET.*HTTP.* as its regular expression and it will moni- tor
the file named (assuming today is May 6th 2009):
/usr/local/apache/logs/access.log-2009-05-06 , tomorrow it
will look for access.log-2009-05-07. The logfile is read
every 60 seconds.</p>

<p>Note: A maximum of 250 logmatch directives can be
specified.</p>

<p>Note: If no logmatch directives are defined, then
walking the logMatchTable will fail (noSuchObject).</p>

<p>ACTIVE MONITORING The usual behaviour of an SNMP agent
is to wait for incoming SNMP requests and respond to them -
if no requests are received, an agent will typically not
initiate any actions. This section describes various
directives that can configure snmpd to take a more active
role.</p>

<p>Notification Handling trapcommunity STRING defines the
default community string to be used when sending traps. Note
that this directive must be used prior to any com-
munity-based trap destination directives that need to use
it.</p>

<p>trapsink HOST [COMMUNITY [PORT]]</p>

<p>trap2sink HOST [COMMUNITY [PORT]]</p>

<p>informsink HOST [COMMUNITY [PORT]] define the address of
a notification receiver that should be sent SNMPv1 TRAPs,
SNMPv2c TRAP2s, or SNMPv2 INFORM notifica- tions
respectively. See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the
snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the format
of listening addresses. If COMMUNITY is not specified, the
most recent trapcommunity string will be used.</p>

<p>If the transport address does not include an explicit
port spec- ification, then PORT will be used. If this is not
specified, the well known SNMP trap port (162) will be
used.</p>

<p>Note: This mechanism is being deprecated, and the
listening port should be specified via the transport
specification HOST instead.</p>

<p>If several sink directives are specified, multiple
copies of each notification (in the appropriate formats)
will be gener- ated.</p>

<p>Note: It is not normally appropriate to list two (or all
three) sink directives with the same destination.</p>

<p>trapsess [SNMPCMD_ARGS] HOST provides a more generic
mechanism for defining notification des- tinations.
SNMPCMD_ARGS should be the command-line options required for
an equivalent snmptrap (or snmpinform) command to send the
desired notification. The option -Ci can be used (with -v2c
or -v3) to generate an INFORM notification rather than an
unacknowledged TRAP.</p>

<p>This is the appropriate directive for defining SNMPv3
trap receivers. See
http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial/tutorial-5/com-
mands/snmptrap-v3.html for more information about SNMPv3
notifi- cation behaviour.</p>

<p>authtrapenable {1|2} determines whether to generate
authentication failure traps (enabled(1)) or not
(disabled(2) - the default). Ordinarily the corresponding
MIB object (snmpEnableAuthenTraps.0) is read- write, but
specifying this directive makes this object read- only, and
attempts to set the value via SET requests will result in a
notWritable error response.</p>

<p>v1trapaddress HOST defines the agent address, which is
inserted into SNMPv1 TRAPs. Arbitrary local IPv4 address is
chosen if this option is ommited. This option is useful
mainly when the agent is visible from outside world by
specific address only (e.g. because of network address
translation or firewall).</p>

<p>DisMan Event MIB The previous directives can be used to
configure where traps should be sent, but are not concerned
with when to send such traps (or what traps should be
generated). This is the domain of the Event MIB - developed
by the Distributed Management (DisMan) working group of the
IETF.</p>

<p>This requires that the agent was built with support for
the dis- man/event module (which is now included as part of
the default build configuration for the most recent
distribution).</p>

<p>Note: The behaviour of the latest implementation differs
in some minor respects from the previous code - nothing too
significant, but existing scripts may possibly need some
minor adjustments.</p>

<p>iquerySecName NAME</p>

<p>agentSecName NAME specifies the default SNMPv3 username,
to be used when making internal queries to retrieve any
necessary information (either for evaluating the monitored
expression, or building a notifica- tion payload). These
internal queries always use SNMPv3, even if normal querying
of the agent is done using SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c.</p>

<p>Note that this user must also be explicitly created
(createUser) and given appropriate access rights (e.g.
rouser). This direc- tive is purely concerned with defining
which user should be used - not with actually setting this
user up.</p>

<p>monitor [OPTIONS] NAME EXPRESSION defines a MIB object
to monitor. If the EXPRESSION condition holds (see below),
then this will trigger the corresponding event, and either
send a notification or apply a SET assignment (or both).
Note that the event will only be triggered once, when the
expression first matches. This monitor entry will not fire
again until the monitored condition first becomes false, and
then matches again. NAME is an administrative name for this
expression, and is used for indexing the mteTriggerTable
(and related tables). Note also that such monitors use an
internal SNMPv3 request to retrieve the values being
monitored (even if normal agent queries typically use SNMPv1
or SNMPv2c). See the iquerySecName token described
above.</p>

<p>EXPRESSION There are three types of monitor expression
supported by the Event MIB - existence, boolean and
threshold tests.</p>

<p>OID | ! OID | != OID defines an existence(0) monitor
test. A bare OID speci- fies a present(0) test, which will
fire when (an instance of) the monitored OID is created. An
expression of the form ! OID specifies an absent(1) test,
which will fire when the monitored OID is delected. An
expression of the form != OID specifies a changed(2) test,
which will fire whenever the monitored value(s) change. Note
that there must be whitespace before the OID token.</p>

<p>OID OP VALUE defines a boolean(1) monitor test. OP
should be one of the defined comparison operators (!=, ==,
&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=) and VALUE should be an integer
value to compare against. Note that there must be whitespace
around the OP token. A comparison such as OID !=0 will not
be handled cor- rectly.</p>

<p>OID MIN MAX [DMIN DMAX] defines a threshold(2) monitor
test. MIN and MAX are integer values, specifying lower and
upper thresholds. If the value of the monitored OID falls
below the lower threshold (MIN) or rises above the upper
threshold (MAX), then the monitor entry will trigger the
corresponding event.</p>

<p>Note that the rising threshold event will only be re-
armed when the monitored value falls below the lower
threshold (MIN). Similarly, the falling threshold event will
be re-armed by the upper threshold (MAX).</p>

<p>The optional parameters DMIN and DMAX configure a pair
of similar threshold tests, but working with the delta dif-
ferences between successive sample values.</p>

<p>OPTIONS There are various options to control the
behaviour of the moni- tored expression. These include:</p>

<p>-D indicates that the expression should be evaluated
using delta differences between sample values (rather than
the values themselves).</p>

<p>-d OID</p>

<p>-di OID specifies a discontinuity marker for validating
delta differences. A -di object instance will be used
exactly as given. A -d object will have the instance
subidenti- fiers from the corresponding (wildcarded)
expression object appended. If the -I flag is specified,
then there is no difference between these two options.</p>

<p>This option also implies -D.</p>

<p>-e EVENT specifies the event to be invoked when this
monitor entry is triggered. If this option is not given, the
monitor entry will generate one of the standard
notifications defined in the DISMAN-EVENT-MIB.</p>

<p>-I indicates that the monitored expression should be
applied to the specified OID as a single instance. By
default, the OID will be treated as a wildcarded object, and
the monitor expanded to cover all matching instances.</p>

<p>-i OID</p>

<p>-o OID define additional varbinds to be added to the
notifica- tion payload when this monitor trigger fires. For
a wildcarded expression, the suffix of the matched instance
will be added to any OIDs specified using -o, while OIDs
specified using -i will be treated as exact instances. If
the -I flag is specified, then there is no difference
between these two options.</p>

<p>See strictDisman for details of the ordering of
notifica- tion payloads.</p>

<p>-r FREQUENCY monitors the given expression every
FREQUENCY seconds. By default, the expression will be
evaluated every 600s (10 minutes).</p>

<p>-S indicates that the monitor expression should not be
eval- uated when the agent first starts up. The first
evalua- tion will be done once the first repeat interval has
expired.</p>

<p>-s indicates that the monitor expression should be
evaluated when the agent first starts up. This is the
default behaviour.</p>

<p>Note: Notifications triggered by this initial evalua-
tion will be sent before the coldStart trap.</p>

<p>-u SECNAME specifies a security name to use for scanning
the local host, instead of the default iquerySecName. Once
again, this user must be explicitly created and given
suitable access rights.</p>

<p>notificationEvent ENAME NOTIFICATION [-m] [-i OID | -o
OID ]* defines a notification event named ENAME. This can be
triggered from a given monitor entry by specifying the
option -e ENAME (see above). NOTIFICATION should be the OID
of the NOTIFICA- TION-TYPE definition for the notification
to be generated.</p>

<p>If the -m option is given, the notification payload will
include the standard varbinds as specified in the OBJECTS
clause of the notification MIB definition. This option must
come after the NOTIFICATION OID (and the relevant MIB file
must be available and loaded by the agent). Otherwise, these
varbinds must be listed explicitly (either here or in the
corresponding monitor directive).</p>

<p>The -i OID and -o OID options specify additional
varbinds to be appended to the notification payload, after
the standard list. If the monitor entry that triggered this
event involved a wild- carded expression, the suffix of the
matched instance will be added to any OIDs specified using
-o, while OIDs specified using -i will be treated as exact
instances. If the -I flag was spec- ified to the monitor
directive, then there is no difference between these two
options.</p>

<p>setEvent ENAME [-I] OID = VALUE defines a set event
named ENAME, assigning the (integer) VALUE to the specified
OID. This can be triggered from a given moni- tor entry by
specifying the option -e ENAME (see above).</p>

<p>If the monitor entry that triggered this event involved
a wild- carded expression, the suffix of the matched
instance will nor- mally be added to the OID. If the -I flag
was specified to either of the monitor or setEvent
directives, the specified OID will be regarded as an exact
single instance.</p>

<p>strictDisman yes The definition of SNMP notifications
states that the varbinds defined in the OBJECT clause should
come first (in the order specified), followed by any
&quot;extra&quot; varbinds that the notifica- tion generator
feels might be useful. The most natural approach would be to
associate these mandatory varbinds with the notifi-
cationEvent entry, and append any varbinds associated with
the monitor entry that triggered the notification to the end
of this list. This is the default behaviour of the Net-SNMP
Event MIB implementation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the DisMan Event MIB specifications
actually state that the trigger-related varbinds should come
first, fol- lowed by the event-related ones. This directive
can be used to restore this strictly-correct (but
inappropriate) behaviour.</p>

<p>Note: Strict DisMan ordering may result in generating
invalid notifications payload lists if the notificationEvent
-n flag is used together with monitor -o (or -i) varbind
options.</p>

<p>If no monitor entries specify payload varbinds, then the
setting of this directive is irrelevant.</p>

<p>linkUpDownNotifications yes will configure the Event MIB
tables to monitor the ifTable for network interfaces being
taken up or down, and triggering a linkUp or linkDown
notification as appropriate.</p>

<p>This is exactly equivalent to the configuration:</p>

<p>notificationEvent linkUpTrap linkUp ifIndex
ifAdminStatus ifOperStatus notificationEvent linkDownTrap
linkDown ifIndex ifAdminStatus ifOperStatus</p>

<p>monitor -r 60 -e linkUpTrap &quot;Generate linkUp&quot;
ifOperStatus != 2 monitor -r 60 -e linkDownTrap
&quot;Generate linkDown&quot; ifOperStatus == 2</p>

<p>defaultMonitors yes will configure the Event MIB tables
to monitor the various UCD- SNMP-MIB tables for problems (as
indicated by the appropriate xxErrFlag column objects).</p>

<p>This is exactly equivalent to the configuration:</p>

<p>monitor -o prNames -o prErrMessage &quot;process
table&quot; prErrorFlag != 0 monitor -o memErrorName -o
memSwapErrorMsg &quot;memory&quot; memSwapError != 0 monitor
-o extNames -o extOutput &quot;extTable&quot; extResult != 0
monitor -o dskPath -o dskErrorMsg &quot;dskTable&quot;
dskErrorFlag != 0 monitor -o laNames -o laErrMessage
&quot;laTable&quot; laErrorFlag != 0 monitor -o fileName -o
fileErrorMsg &quot;fileTable&quot; fileErrorFlag != 0</p>

<p>In both these latter cases, the snmpd.conf must also
contain a iquery- SecName directive, together with a
corresponding createUser entry and suitable access control
configuration.</p>

<p>DisMan Schedule MIB The DisMan working group also
produced a mechanism for scheduling par- ticular actions (a
specified SET assignment) at given times. This requires that
the agent was built with support for the disman/schedule
module (which is included as part of the default build
configuration for the most recent distribution).</p>

<p>There are three ways of specifying the scheduled
action:</p>

<p>repeat FREQUENCY OID = VALUE configures a SET assignment
of the (integer) VALUE to the MIB instance OID, to be run
every FREQUENCY seconds.</p>

<p>cron MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH WEEKDAY OID = VALUE
configures a SET assignment of the (integer) VALUE to the
MIB instance OID, to be run at the times specified by the
fields MINUTE to WEEKDAY. These follow the same pattern as
the equiva- lent crontab(5) fields.</p>

<p>Note: These fields should be specified as a
(comma-separated) list of numeric values. Named values for
the MONTH and WEEKDAY fields are not supported, and neither
are value ranges. A wildcard match can be specified as
*.</p>

<p>The DAY field can also accept negative values, to
indicate days counting backwards from the end of the
month.</p>

<p>at MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH WEEKDAY OID = VALUE configures
a one-shot SET assignment, to be run at the first matching
time as specified by the fields MINUTE to WEEKDAY. The
interpretation of these fields is exactly the same as for
the cron directive.</p>

<p>EXTENDING AGENT FUNCTIONALITY One of the first
distinguishing features of the original UCD suite was the
ability to extend the functionality of the agent - not just
by recompiling with code for new MIB modules, but also by
configuring the running agent to report additional
information. There are a number of techniques to support
this, including:</p>

<p>&middot; running external commands (exec, extend,
pass)</p>

<p>&middot; loading new code dynamically (embedded perl,
dlmod)</p>

<p>&middot; communicating with other agents (proxy, SMUX,
AgentX)</p>

<p>Arbitrary Extension Commands The earliest extension
mechanism was the ability to run arbitrary com- mands or
shell scripts. Such commands do not need to be aware of SNMP
operations, or conform to any particular behaviour - the MIB
structures are designed to accommodate any form of command
output. Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was
built with support for the ucd- snmp/extensible and/or
agent/extend modules (which are both included as part of the
default build configuration).</p>

<p>exec [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS</p>

<p>sh [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS invoke the named PROG with
arguments of ARGS. By default the exit status and first line
of output from the command will be reported via the
extTable, discarding any additional output.</p>

<p>Note: Entries in this table appear in the order they are
read from the configuration file. This means that adding new
exec (or sh) directives and restarting the agent, may affect
the indexing of other entries.</p>

<p>The PROG argument for exec directives must be a full
path to a real binary, as it is executed via the exec()
system call. To invoke a shell script, use the sh directive
instead.</p>

<p>If MIBOID is specified, then the results will be rooted
at this point in the OID tree, returning the exit statement
as MIBOID.100.0 and the entire command output in a
pseudo-table based at MIBNUM.101 - with one row for each
line of output.</p>

<p>Note: The layout of this &quot;relocatable&quot; form of
exec (or sh) output does not strictly form a valid MIB
structure. This mechanism is being deprecated - please see
the extend directive (described below) instead.</p>

<p>The agent does not cache the exit status or output of
the exe- cuted program.</p>

<p>execfix NAME PROG ARGS registers a command that can be
invoked on demand - typically to respond to or fix errors
with the corresponding exec or sh entry. When the extErrFix
instance for a given NAMEd entry is set to the integer value
of 1, this command will be called.</p>

<p>Note: This directive can only be used in combination
with a corresponding exec or sh directive, which must be
defined first. Attempting to define an unaccompanied execfix
directive will fail.</p>

<p>exec and sh extensions can only be configured via the
snmpd.conf file. They cannot be set up via SNMP SET
requests.</p>

<p>extend [MIBOID] NAME PROG ARGS works in a similar manner
to the exec directive, but with a num- ber of improvements.
The MIB tables (nsExtendConfigTable etc) are indexed by the
NAME token, so are unaffected by the order in which entries
are read from the configuration files. There are two result
tables - one (nsExtendOutput1Table) containing the exit
status, the first line and full output (as a single string)
for each extend entry, and the other (nsExtendOutput2Table)
con- taining the complete output as a series of separate
lines.</p>

<p>If MIBOID is specified, then the configuration and
result tables will be rooted at this point in the OID tree,
but are otherwise structured in exactly the same way. This
means that several sep- arate extend directives can specify
the same MIBOID root, with- out conflicting.</p>

<p>The exit status and output is cached for each entry
individu- ally, and can be cleared (and the caching
behaviour configured) using the nsCacheTable.</p>

<p>extendfix NAME PROG ARGS registers a command that can be
invoked on demand, by setting the appropriate
nsExtendRunType instance to the value run-com- mand(3).
Unlike the equivalent execfix, this directive does not need
to be paired with a corresponding extend entry, and can
appear on its own.</p>

<p>Both extend and extendfix directives can be configured
dynamically, using SNMP SET requests to the
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB.</p>

<p>MIB-Specific Extension Commands The first group of
extension directives invoke arbitrary commands, and rely on
the MIB structure (and management applications) having the
flexibility to accommodate and interpret the output. This is
a conve- nient way to make information available quickly and
simply, but is of no use when implementing specific MIB
objects, where the extension must conform to the structure
of the MIB (rather than vice versa). The remaining extension
mechanisms are all concerned with such MIB-specific
situations - starting with &quot;pass-through&quot; scripts.
Use of this mecha- nism requires that the agent was built
with support for the ucd- snmp/pass and
ucd-snmp/pass_persist modules (which are both included as
part of the default build configuration).</p>

<p>pass [-p priority] MIBOID PROG will pass control of the
subtree rooted at MIBOID to the speci- fied PROG command.
GET and GETNEXT requests for OIDs within this tree will
trigger this command, called as:</p>

<p>PROG -g OID</p>

<p>PROG -n OID</p>

<p>respectively, where OID is the requested OID. The PROG
command should return the response varbind as three separate
lines printed to stdout - the first line should be the OID
of the returned value, the second should be its TYPE (one of
the text strings integer, gauge, counter, timeticks,
ipaddress, objectid, or string ), and the third should be
the value itself.</p>

<p>If the command cannot return an appropriate varbind -
e.g the specified OID did not correspond to a valid instance
for a GET request, or there were no following instances for
a GETNEXT - then it should exit without producing any
output. This will result in an SNMP noSuchName error, or a
noSuchInstance excep- tion.</p>

<p>Note: The SMIv2 type counter64 and SNMPv2 noSuchObject
exception are not supported.</p>

<p>A SET request will result in the command being called
as:</p>

<p>PROG -s OID TYPE VALUE</p>

<p>where TYPE is one of the tokens listed above, indicating
the type of the value passed as the third parameter.</p>

<p>If the assignment is successful, the PROG command should
exit without producing any output. Errors should be
indicated by writing one of the strings not-writable, or
wrong-type to std- out, and the agent will generate the
appropriate error response.</p>

<p>Note: The other SNMPv2 errors are not supported.</p>

<p>In either case, the command should exit once it has
finished processing. Each request (and each varbind within a
single request) will trigger a separate invocation of the
command.</p>

<p>The default registration priority is 127. This can be
changed by supplying the optional -p flag, with lower
priority registra- tions being used in preference to higher
priority values.</p>

<p>pass_persist [-p priority] MIBOID PROG will also pass
control of the subtree rooted at MIBOID to the specified
PROG command. However this command will continue to run
after the initial request has been answered, so subsequent
requests can be processed without the startup overheads.</p>

<p>Upon initialization, PROG will be passed the string
&quot;PING0 on stdin, and should respond by printing
&quot;PONG0 to stdout.</p>

<p>For GET and GETNEXT requests, PROG will be passed two
lines on stdin, the command (get or getnext) and the
requested OID. It should respond by printing three lines to
stdout - the OID for the result varbind, the TYPE and the
VALUE itself - exactly as for the pass directive above. If
the command cannot return an appropriate varbind, it should
print print &quot;NONE0 to stdout (but continue
running).</p>

<p>For SET requests, PROG will be passed three lines on
stdin, the command (set) and the requested OID, followed by
the type and value (both on the same line). If the
assignment is successful, the command should print
&quot;DONE0 to stdout. Errors should be indicated by writing
one of the strings not-writable, wrong- type, wrong-length,
wrong-value or inconsistent-value to stdout, and the agent
will generate the appropriate error response. In either
case, the command should continue running.</p>

<p>The registration priority can be changed using the
optional -p flag, just as for the pass directive.</p>

<p>pass and pass_persist extensions can only be configured
via the snmpd.conf file. They cannot be set up via SNMP SET
requests.</p>

<p>Embedded Perl Support Programs using the previous
extension mechanisms can be written in any convenient
programming language - including perl, which is a common
choice for pass-through extensions in particular. However
the Net-SNMP agent also includes support for embedded perl
technology (similar to mod_perl for the Apache web server).
This allows the agent to inter- pret perl scripts directly,
thus avoiding the overhead of spawning pro- cesses and
initializing the perl system when a request is received.</p>

<p>Use of this mechanism requires that the agent was built
with support for the embedded perl mechanism, which is not
part of the default build environment. It must be explicitly
included by specifying the --enable-embedded-perl option to
the configure script when the pack- age is first built.</p>

<p>If enabled, the following directives will be
recognised:</p>

<p>disablePerl true will turn off embedded perl support
entirely (e.g. if there are problems with the perl
installation).</p>

<p>perlInitFile FILE loads the specified initialisation
file (if present) immediately before the first perl
directive is parsed. If not explicitly specified, the agent
will look for the default initialisation file
/usr/share/snmp/snmp_perl.pl.</p>

<p>The default initialisation file creates an instance of a
Net- SNMP::agent object - a variable $agent which can be
used to reg- ister perl-based MIB handler routines.</p>

<p>perl EXPRESSION evaluates the given expression. This
would typically register a handler routine to be called when
a section of the OID tree was requested: perl use
Data::Dumper; perl sub myroutine { print &quot;got called:
&quot;,Dumper(@_),&quot;0; } perl
$agent-&gt;register(mylink, .1.3.6.1.8765, myroutine);</p>

<p>This expression could also source an external file: perl
do /path/to/file.pl;</p>

<p>or perform any other perl-based processing that might be
required.</p>

<p>Dynamically Loadable Modules Most of the MIBs supported
by the Net-SNMP agent are implemented as C code modules,
which were compiled and linked into the agent libraries when
the suite was first built. Such implementation modules can
also be compiled independently and loaded into the running
agent once it has started. Use of this mechanism requires
that the agent was built with support for the ucd-snmp/dlmod
module (which is included as part of the default build
configuration).</p>

<p>dlmod NAME PATH will load the shared object module from
the file PATH (an abso- lute filename), and call the
initialisation routine init_NAME.</p>

<p>Note: If the specified PATH is not a fully qualified
filename, it will be interpreted relative to
/usr/lib(64)/snmp/dlmod, and .so will be appended to the
filename.</p>

<p>This functionality can also be configured using SNMP SET
requests to the UCD-DLMOD-MIB.</p>

<p>Proxy Support Another mechanism for extending the
functionality of the agent is to pass selected requests (or
selected varbinds) to another SNMP agent, which can be
running on the same host (presumably listening on a dif-
ferent port), or on a remote system. This can be viewed
either as the main agent delegating requests to the remote
one, or acting as a proxy for it. Use of this mechanism
requires that the agent was built with support for the
ucd-snmp/proxy module (which is included as part of the
default build configuration).</p>

<p>proxy [-Cn CONTEXTNAME] [SNMPCMD_ARGS] HOST OID
[REMOTEOID] will pass any incoming requests under OID to the
agent listening on the port specified by the transport
address HOST. See the section LISTENING ADDRESSES in the
snmpd(8) manual page for more information about the format
of listening addresses.</p>

<p>Note: To proxy the entire MIB tree, use the OID .1.3
(not the top-level .1)</p>

<p>The SNMPCMD_ARGS should provide sufficient version and
administrative information to generate a valid SNMP request
(see snmpcmd(1)).</p>

<p>Note: The proxied request will not use the
administrative settings from the original request.</p>

<p>If a CONTEXTNAME is specified, this will register the
proxy delegation within the named context in the local
agent. Defining multiple proxy directives for the same OID
but different contexts can be used to query several remote
agents through a single proxy, by specifying the appro-
priate SNMPv3 context in the incoming request (or using
suitable con- figured community strings - see the com2sec
directive).</p>

<p>Specifying the REMOID parameter will map the local MIB
tree rooted at OID to an equivalent subtree rooted at REMOID
on the remote agent.</p>

<p>SMUX Sub-Agents The Net-SNMP agent supports the SMUX
protocol (RFC 1227) to communicate with SMUX-based subagents
(such as gated, zebra or quagga). Use of this mechanism
requires that the agent was built with support for the smux
module, which is not part of the default build environment,
and must be explicitly included by specifying the
--with-mib-modules=smux option to the configure script when
the package is first built.</p>

<p>Note: This extension protocol has been officially
deprecated in favour of AgentX (see below).</p>

<p>smuxpeer OID PASS will register a subtree for SMUX-based
processing, to be authen- ticated using the password PASS.
If a subagent (or &quot;peer&quot;) con- nects to the agent
and registers this subtree then requests for OIDs within it
will be passed to that SMUX subagent for process- ing.</p>

<p>A suitable entry for an OSPF routing daemon (such as
gated, zebra or quagga) might be something like smuxpeer
.1.3.6.1.2.1.14 ospf_pass</p>

<p>smuxsocket &lt;IPv4-address&gt; defines the IPv4 address
for SMUX peers to communicate with the Net-SNMP agent. The
default is to listen on all IPv4 interfaces
(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;), unless the package has been
configured with &quot;--enable-local-smux&quot; at build
time, which causes it to only listen on 127.0.0.1 by
default. SMUX uses the well-known TCP port 199.</p>

<p>Note the Net-SNMP agent will only operate as a SMUX
master agent. It does not support acting in a SMUX subagent
role.</p>

<p>AgentX Sub-Agents The Net-SNMP agent supports the AgentX
protocol (RFC 2741) in both mas- ter and subagent roles. Use
of this mechanism requires that the agent was built with
support for the agentx module (which is included as part of
the default build configuration), and also that this support
is explicitly enabled (e.g. via the snmpd.conf file).</p>

<p>There are two directives specifically relevant to
running as an AgentX master agent:</p>

<p>master agentx will enable the AgentX functionality and
cause the agent to start listening for incoming AgentX
registrations. This can also be activated by specifying the
-x command-line option (to specify an alternative listening
socket).</p>

<p>agentXPerms SOCKPERMS [DIRPERMS [USER|UID [GROUP|GID]]]
Defines the permissions and ownership of the AgentX Unix
Domain socket, and the parent directories of this socket.
SOCKPERMS and DIRPERMS must be octal digits (see chmod(1) ).
By default this socket will only be accessible to subagents
which have the same userid as the agent.</p>

<p>There is one directive specifically relevant to running
as an AgentX sub-agent:</p>

<p>agentXPingInterval NUM will make the subagent try and
reconnect every NUM seconds to the master if it ever becomes
(or starts) disconnected.</p>

<p>The remaining directives are relevant to both AgentX
master and sub- agents:</p>

<p>agentXSocket
[&lt;transport-specifier&gt;:]&lt;transport-address&gt;[,...]
defines the address the master agent listens at, or the
subagent should connect to. The default is the Unix Domain
socket &quot;/var/agentx/master&quot;. Another common
alternative is tcp:local- host:705. See the section
LISTENING ADDRESSES in the snmpd(8) manual page for more
information about the format of addresses.</p>

<p>Note: Specifying an AgentX socket does not automatically
enable AgentX functionality (unlike the -x command-line
option).</p>

<p>agentXTimeout NUM defines the timeout period (NUM
seconds) for an AgentX request. Default is 1 second.</p>

<p>agentXRetries NUM defines the number of retries for an
AgentX request. Default is 5 retries.</p>

<p>net-snmp ships with both C and Perl APIs to develop your
own AgentX subagent.</p>

<p>OTHER CONFIGURATION override [-rw] OID TYPE VALUE This
directive allows you to override a particular OID with a
different value (and possibly a different type of value).
The -rw flag will allow snmp SETs to modify it s value as
well. (note that if you re overriding original
functionality, that functionality will be entirely lost.
Thus SETS will do nothing more than modify the internal
overridden value and will not per- form any of the original
functionality intended to be provided by the MIB object. Its
an emulation only.) An example:</p>

<p>override sysDescr.0 octet_str &quot;my own
sysDescr&quot;</p>

<p>That line will set the sysDescr.0 value to &quot;my own
sysDescr&quot; as well as make it modifiable with SNMP SETs
as well (which is actually illegal according to the MIB
specifications).</p>

<p>Note that care must be taken when using this. For
example, if you try to override a property of the 3rd
interface in the ifTable with a new value and later the
numbering within the ifTable changes it s index ordering
youll end up with problems and your modified value wont
appear in the right place in the table.</p>

<p>Valid TYPEs are: integer, uinteger, octet_str,
object_id, counter, null (for gauges, use
&quot;uinteger&quot;; for bit strings, use
&quot;octet_str&quot;). Note that setting an object to
&quot;null&quot; effectively deletes it as being accessible.
No VALUE needs to be given if the object type is null.</p>

<p>More types should be available in the future.</p>

<p>If you re trying to figure out aspects of the various
mib modules (pos- sibly some that youve added yourself), the
following may help you spit out some useful debugging
information. First off, please read the snmpd manual page on
the -D flag. Then the following configuration snmpd.conf
token, combined with the -D flag, can produce useful
output:</p>

<p>injectHandler HANDLER modulename This will insert new
handlers into the section of the mib tree referenced by
&quot;modulename&quot;. The types of handlers available for
insertion are:</p>

<p>stash_cache Caches information returned from the lower
level. This greatly help the performance of the agent, at
the cost of caching the data such that its no longer
&quot;live&quot; for 30 seconds (in this future, this will
be configurable). Note that this means snmpd will use more
memory as well while the information is cached. Currently
this only works for handlers registered using the
table_iterator support, which is only a few mib tables. To
use it, you need to make sure to install it before the
table_iterator point in the chain, so to do this:</p>

<p>injectHandler stash_cache NAME ta- ble_iterator</p>

<p>If you want a table to play with, try walking the nsMod-
uleTable with and without this injected.</p>

<p>debug Prints out lots of debugging information when the
-Dhelper:debug flag is passed to the snmpd application.</p>

<p>read_only Forces turning off write support for the given
module.</p>

<p>serialize If a module is failing to handle multiple
requests prop- erly (using the new 5.0 module API), this
will force the module to only receive one request at a
time.</p>

<p>bulk_to_next If a module registers to handle getbulk
support, but for some reason is failing to implement it
properly, this module will convert all getbulk requests to
getnext requests before the final module receives it.</p>

<p>dontLogTCPWrappersConnects If the snmpd was compiled
with TCP Wrapper support, it logs every connection made to
the agent. This setting disables the log messages for
accepted connections. Denied connections will still be
logged.</p>

<p>Figuring out module names To figure out which modules
you can inject things into, run snm- pwalk on the
nsModuleTable which will give a list of all named modules
registered within the agent.</p>

<p>Internal Data tables table NAME</p>

<p>add_row NAME INDEX(ES) VALUE(S)</p>

<p>NOTES o The Net-SNMP agent can be instructed to re-read
the various con- figuration files, either via an snmpset
assignment of integer(1) to
UCD-SNMP-MIB::versionUpdateConfig.0
(.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.100.11.0), or by sending a kill -HUP
signal to the agent process.</p>

<p>o All directives listed with a value of &quot;yes&quot;
actually accept a range of boolean values. These will accept
any of 1, yes or true to enable the corresponding behaviour,
or any of 0, no or false to disable it. The default in each
case is for the fea- ture to be turned off, so these
directives are typically only used to enable the appropriate
behaviour.</p>
