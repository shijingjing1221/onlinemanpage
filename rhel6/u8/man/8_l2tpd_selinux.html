<p>NAME l2tpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the l2tpd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the l2tpd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The l2tpd processes execute with the l2tpd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep l2tpd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The l2tpd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the file_type, unlabeled_t, proc_type, filesystem_type,
l2tpd_exec_t, mtrr_device_t, sysctl_type file types.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the l2tpd_t domain are
the following:</p>

<p>all files on the system, /usr/sbin/xl2tpd,
/usr/sbin/prol2tpd, /usr/sbin/openl2tpd, /dev/cpu/mtrr</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their l2tpd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for l2tpd:</p>

<p>l2tpd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a l2tpd_t can be used to make
the process type l2tpd_t permissive. SELinux does not deny
access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux
denials) messages are still gener- ated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. l2tpd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run l2tpd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons to write corefiles to
/, you must turn on the allow_daemons_dump_core boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_dump_core 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons to use tcp wrappers,
you must turn on the allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons the ability to
read/write terminals, you must turn on the
allow_daemons_use_tty boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tty 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their heap memory executable. Doing this is a really bad
idea. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could
indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in
bugzilla, you must turn on the allow_execheap boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execheap 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to map a
memory region as both executable and writable, this is
dangerous and the executable should be reported in
bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execmem boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmem 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all unconfined executables to use
libraries requiring text relocation that are not labeled
textrel_shlib_t), you must turn on the allow_execmod
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execmod 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow unconfined executables to make
their stack exe- cutable. This should never, ever be
necessary. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but
could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported
in bugzilla), you must turn on the allow_execstack boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable cluster mode for daemons, you must
turn on the daemons_enable_cluster_mode boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P daemons_enable_cluster_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable support for upstart as the init
program, you must turn on the init_upstart boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P init_upstart 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow certain domains to map low memory
in the kernel, you must turn on the mmap_low_allowed
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1</p>

<p>If you want to boolean to determine whether the system
permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing
boolean values. Set this to true and you have to reboot to
set it back, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1</p>

<p>If you want to support X userspace object manager, you
must turn on the xserver_object_manager boolean. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for l2tpd:</p>

<p>l2tp_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 1701 udp 1701</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type l2tpd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>EQUIVALENCE DIRECTORIES</p>

<p>l2tpd policy stores data with multiple different file
context types under the /var/run/xl2tpd directory. If you
would like to store the data in a different directory you
can use the semanage command to cre- ate an equivalence
mapping. If you wanted to store this data under the /srv
dirctory you would execute the following command:</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -e /var/run/xl2tpd /srv/xl2tpd
restorecon -R -v /srv/xl2tpd</p>

<p>l2tpd policy stores data with multiple different file
context types under the /var/run/prol2tpd directory. If you
would like to store the data in a different directory you
can use the semanage command to cre- ate an equivalence
mapping. If you wanted to store this data under the /srv
dirctory you would execute the following command:</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -e /var/run/prol2tpd /srv/prol2tpd
restorecon -R -v /srv/prol2tpd</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the l2tpd, if
you wanted to store files with these types in a diffent
paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify
alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels
on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t l2tpd_var_run_t
/srv/myl2tpd_content(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/myl2tpd_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for l2tpd:</p>

<p>l2tpd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the l2tpd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/xl2tpd, /usr/sbin/prol2tpd,
/usr/sbin/openl2tpd</p>

<p>l2tpd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the l2tpd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/rc.d/init.d/xl2tpd,
/etc/rc.d/init.d/prol2tpd, /etc/rc.d/init.d/openl2tpd</p>

<p>l2tpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store l2tpd tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>l2tpd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the l2tpd files under the /run or /var/run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/xl2tpd(/.*)?, /var/run/prol2tpd(/.*)?,
/var/run/xl2tpd.pid, /var/run/prol2tpd.ctl,
/var/run/prol2tpd.pid, /var/run/openl2tpd.pid</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
