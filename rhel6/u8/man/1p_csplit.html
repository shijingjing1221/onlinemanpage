<p>CSPLIT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CSPLIT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME csplit - split files based on context</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS csplit [-ks][-f prefix][-n number] file arg1
...argn</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The csplit utility shall read the file named
by the file operand, write all or part of that file into
other files as directed by the arg operands, and write the
sizes of the files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The csplit utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-f prefix Name the created files prefix 00, prefix 01,
..., prefixn. The default is xx00 ... xx n. If the prefix
argument would create a filename exceeding {NAME_MAX} bytes,
an error shall result, csplit shall exit with a diagnostic
message, and no files shall be created.</p>

<p>-k Leave previously created files intact. By default,
csplit shall remove created files if an error occurs.</p>

<p>-n number Use number decimal digits to form filenames
for the file pieces. The default shall be 2.</p>

<p>-s Suppress the output of file size messages.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file The pathname of a text file to be split. If file
is, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>The operands arg1 ... argn can be a combination of the
following:</p>

<p>/rexp/[offset]</p>

<p>A file shall be created using the content of the lines
from the current line up to, but not including, the line
that results from the evaluation of the regular expression
with offset, if any, applied. The regular expression rexp
shall follow the rules for basic regular expressions
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Regular Expressions. The
application shall use the sequence /&quot; to specify a
slash character within the rexp. The optional offset shall
be a positive or negative integer value representing a
number of lines. A positive integer value can be preceded
by+ . If the selection of lines from an offset expression of
this type would create a file with zero lines, or one with
greater than the number of lines left in the input file, the
results are unspecified. After the section is created, the
current line shall be set to the line that results from the
evaluation of the regular expression with any offset
applied. If the current line is the first line in the file
and a regular expression operation has not yet been
performed, the pattern match of rexp shall be applied from
the current line to the end of the file. Otherwise, the
pattern match of rexp shall be applied from the line follow-
ing the current line to the end of the file.</p>

<p>%rexp%[offset]</p>

<p>Equivalent to /rexp/[offset], except that no file shall
be cre- ated for the selected section of the input file. The
application shall use the sequence %&quot; to specify a
percent-sign character within the rexp.</p>

<p>line_no Create a file from the current line up to (but
not including) the line number line_no. Lines in the file
shall be numbered starting at one. The current line becomes
line_no.</p>

<p>{num} Repeat operand. This operand can follow any of the
operands described previously. If it follows a rexp type
operand, that operand shall be applied num more times. If it
follows a line_no operand, the file shall be split every
line_no lines, num times, from that point.</p>

<p>An error shall be reported if an operand does not
reference a line between the current position and the end of
the file.</p>

<p>STDIN See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file shall be a text file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of csplit:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and the behavior of character classes
within regular expres- sions.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS If the -k option is specified,
created files shall be retained. Other- wise, the default
action occurs.</p>

<p>STDOUT Unless the -s option is used, the standard output
shall consist of one line per file created, with a format as
follows:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;file size in bytes&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The output files shall contain portions of
the original input file; otherwise, unchanged.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS By default, created files shall
be removed if an error occurs. When the -k option is
specified, created files shall not be removed if an error
occurs.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. This example creates four files, cobol00 ...
cobol03:</p>

<p>csplit -f cobol file /procedure division//par5./
/par16./</p>

<p>After editing the split files, they can be recombined as
follows:</p>

<p>cat cobol0[0-3] &gt; file</p>

<p>Note that this example overwrites the original file.</p>

<p>2. This example would split the file after the first 99
lines, and every 100 lines thereafter, up to 9999 lines;
this is because lines in the file are numbered from 1 rather
than zero, for historical reasons:</p>

<p>csplit -k file 100 {99}</p>

<p>3. Assuming that prog.c follows the C-language coding
convention of ending routines with a}at the beginning of the
line, this exam- ple creates a file containing each separate
C routine (up to 21) in prog.c:</p>

<p>csplit -k prog.c%main(%/^}/+1{20}</p>

<p>RATIONALE The -n option was added to extend the range of
filenames that could be handled.</p>

<p>Consideration was given to adding a -a flag to use the
alphabetic file- name generation used by the historical
split utility, but the function- ality added by the -n
option was deemed to make alphabetic naming unnecessary.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
