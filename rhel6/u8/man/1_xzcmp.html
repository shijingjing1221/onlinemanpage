<p>XZDIFF(1) XZ Utils XZDIFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME xzcmp, xzdiff, lzcmp, lzdiff - compare compressed
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xzcmp [cmp_options] file1 [file2] xzdiff
[diff_options] file1 [file2] lzcmp [cmp_options] file1
[file2] lzdiff [diff_options] file1 [file2]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xzcmp and xdiff invoke cmp(1) or diff(1) on
files compressed with xz(1), lzma(1), gzip(1), or bzip2(1).
All options specified are passed directly to cmp or diff. If
only one file is specified, then the files compared are
file1 (which must have a suffix of a supported compression
format) and file1 from which the compression format suffix
has been stripped. If two files are specified, then they are
uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp(1) or diff(1). The
exit status from cmp or diff is preserved.</p>

<p>The names lzcmp and lzdiff are provided for backward
compatibility with LZMA Utils.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cmp(1), diff(1), xz(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1),
zdiff(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Messages from the cmp(1) or diff(1) programs refer
to temporary file- names instead of those specified.</p>
