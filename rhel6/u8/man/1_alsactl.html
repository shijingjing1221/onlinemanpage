<p>NAME alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard
driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS alsactl [options] [store|restore|init] &lt;card
# or id or device&gt;</p>

<p>alsactl monitor &lt;card # or id&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION alsactl is used to control advanced settings
for the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple
soundcards. If your card has features that you cant seem to
control from a mixer application, you have come to the right
place.</p>

<p>COMMANDS store saves the current driver state for the
selected soundcard to the configuration file.</p>

<p>restore loads driver state for the selected soundcard
from the configu- ration file. If restoring fails
(eventually partly), the init action is called.</p>

<p>nrestore is like restore, but it notifies also the
daemon to do new rescan for available soundcards.</p>

<p>init tries to initialize all devices to a default state.
If device is not known, error code 99 is returned.</p>

<p>daemon manages to save periodically the sound state.</p>

<p>rdaemon like daemon but restore the sound state at
first.</p>

<p>kill notifies the daemon to do the specified operation
(quit, rescan, save_and_quit).</p>

<p>monitor is for monitoring the events received from the
given control device.</p>

<p>If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will
be saved, loaded or monitored.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Help: show available flags and
commands.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print alsactl version number.</p>

<p>-f, --file Select the configuration file to use. The
default is /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.</p>

<p>-l, --lock Use the file locking to serialize the
concurrent access to the state file (this option is default
for the global state file).</p>

<p>-L, --no-lock Do not use the file locking to serialize
the concurrent access to the state file (including the
global state file).</p>

<p>-O, --lock-state-file Select the state lock file
path.</p>

<p>-F, --force Used with restore command. Try to restore
the matching control elements as much as possible. This
option is set as default now.</p>

<p>-g, --ignore Used with store and restore commands. Do
not show No soundcards found and do not set an error exit
code when soundcards are not installed.</p>

<p>-P, --pedantic Used with restore command. Don t restore
mismatching control elements. This option was the old
default behavior.</p>

<p>-I, --no-init-fallback Dont initialize cards if restore
fails. Since version 1.0.18, alsactl tries to initialize the
card with the restore operation as default. But this can
cause incompatibility with the older version. The caller may
expect that the state won t be touched if no state file
exists. This option takes the restore behavior back to the
older version by suppressing the initialization.</p>

<p>-r, --runstate Save restore and init state to this file.
The file will contain only errors. Errors are appended with
the soundcard id to the end of file.</p>

<p>-R, --remove Remove runstate file at first.</p>

<p>-E, --env #=# Set environment variable (useful for init
action or you may override ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read
different or optimized config- uration - may be useful for
&quot;boot&quot; scripts).</p>

<p>-i, --initfile The configuration file for init. By
default, PRE- FIX/share/alsa/init/00main is used.</p>

<p>-p, --period The store period in seconds for the daemon
command.</p>

<p>-e, --pid-file The pathname to store the process-id file
in the HDB UUCP format (ASCII).</p>

<p>-b, --background Run the task in background.</p>

<p>-s, --syslog Use syslog for messages.</p>

<p>-n, --nice Set the process priority (see man nice)</p>

<p>-c, --sched-idle Set the process scheduling policy to
idle (SCHED_IDLE).</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/alsa/asound.state (or whatever file you
specify with the -f flag) is used to store current settings
for your soundcards. The set- tings include all the usual
soundcard mixer settings. More impor- tantly, alsactl is
capable of controlling other card-specific features that
mixer apps usually dont know about.</p>

<p>The configuration file is generated automatically by
running alsactl store. Editing the configuration file by
hand may be necessary for some soundcard features (e.g.
enabling/disabling automatic mic gain, digital output,
joystick/game ports, some future MIDI routing options,
etc).</p>
