<p>XGraphicsExposeEvent(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XGraphicsExposeEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGraphicsExposeEvent, XNoExposeEvent -
GraphicsExpose and NoExpose event structures</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structures for GraphicsExpose and
NoExpose events contain:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* GraphicsExpose */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Drawable drawable; int x, y; int width, height; int
count; /* if nonzero, at least this many more */ int
major_code; /* core is CopyArea or CopyPlane */ int
minor_code; /* not defined in the core */ }
XGraphicsExposeEvent;</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* NoExpose */ unsigned long
serial; /* # of last request processed by server */ Bool
send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */
Drawable drawable; int major_code; /* core is CopyArea or
CopyPlane */ int minor_code; /* not defined in the core */ }
XNoExposeEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive these events, their structure members
are set as fol- lows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>Both structures have these common members: drawable,
major_code, and minor_code. The drawable member is set to
the drawable of the destina- tion region on which the
graphics request was to be performed. The major_code member
is set to the graphics request initiated by the client and
can be either X_CopyArea or X_CopyPlane. If it is X_Copy-
Area, a call to XCopyArea initiated the request. If it is
X_CopyPlane, a call to XCopyPlane initiated the request.
These constants are defined in &lt;X11/Xproto.h&gt;. The
minor_code member, like the major_code member, indicates
which graphics request was initiated by the client. However,
the minor_code member is not defined by the core X protocol
and will be zero in these cases, although it may be used by
an exten- sion.</p>

<p>The XGraphicsExposeEvent structure has these additional
members: x, y, width, height, and count. The x and y members
are set to the coordi- nates relative to the drawables
origin and indicate the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
The width and height members are set to the size (extent) of
the rectangle. The count member is set to the number of
GraphicsExpose events to follow. If count is zero, no more
Graphic- sExpose events follow for this window. However, if
count is nonzero, at least that number of GraphicsExpose
events (and possibly more) are to follow for this
window.</p>
