<p>NCAT(1) Ncat Reference Guide NCAT(1)</p>

<p>NAME ncat - Concatenate and redirect sockets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ncat [OPTIONS...] [hostname] [port]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility
which reads and writes data across networks from the command
line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project and is the
culmination of the currently splintered family of Netcat
incarnations. It is designed to be a reliable back-end tool
to instantly provide network connectivity to other
applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4
and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless
number of potential uses.</p>

<p>Among Ncat&acute;s vast number of features there is the
ability to chain Ncats together; redirection of TCP, UDP,
and SCTP ports to other sites; SSL support; and proxy
connections via SOCKS4 or HTTP proxies (with optional proxy
authentication as well). Some general principles apply to
most applications and thus give you the capability of
instantly adding networking support to software that would
normally never support it.</p>

<p>See the ncat(1) manpage for full options, descriptions
and usage examples</p>

<p>CONNECT MODE AND LISTEN MODE Ncat operates in one of two
primary modes: connect mode and listen mode. Other modes,
such as the HTTP proxy server, act as special cases of these
two. In connect mode, Ncat works as a client. In listen mode
it is a server.</p>

<p>In connect mode, the hostname and port arguments tell
what to connect to. hostname is required, and may be a
hostname or IP address. If port is supplied, it must be a
decimal port number. If omitted, it defaults to 31337..</p>

<p>In listen mode, hostname and port control the address
the server will bind to. Both arguments are optional in
listen mode. If hostname is omitted, it defaults to
listening on all available addresses. If port is omitted, it
defaults to 31337.</p>

<p>PROTOCOL OPTIONS -4 (IPv4 only) . Force the use of IPv4
only (default).</p>

<p>-6 (IPv6 only) . Force the use of IPv6 only.</p>

<p>-u, --udp (Use UDP) . Use UDP for the connection (the
default is TCP).</p>

<p>--sctp (Use SCTP) . Use SCTP for the connection (the
default is TCP). SCTP support is implemented in
TCP-compatible mode.</p>

<p>CONNECT MODE OPTIONS -g hop1[,hop2,...] (Loose source
routing) . Sets hops for IPv4 loose source routing. You can
use -g once with a comma-separated list of hops, use -g
multiple times with single hops to build the list, or
combine the two. Hops can be given as IP addresses or
hostnames.</p>

<p>-G ptr (Set source routing pointer) . Sets the IPv4
source route pointer for use with -g. The argument must be a
multiple of 4 and no more than 28. Not all operating systems
support setting this pointer to anything other than
four.</p>

<p>-p port, --source-port port (Specify source port) . Set
the port number for Ncat to bind to.</p>

<p>-s host, --source host (Specify source address) . Set
the address for Ncat to bind to.</p>

<p>LISTEN MODE OPTIONS See the section called ACCESS
CONTROL OPTIONS for information on limiting the hosts that
may connect to the listening Ncat process.</p>

<p>-l, --listen (Listen for connections) . Listen for
connections rather than connecting to a remote machine</p>

<p>-m numconns, --max-conns numconns (Specify maximum
number of connections) . The maximum number of simultaneous
connections accepted by an Ncat instance. 100 is the
default.</p>

<p>-k, --keep-open (Accept multiple connections) . Normally
a listening server accepts only one connection and then
quits when the connection is closed. This option makes it
accept multiple simultaneous connections and wait for more
connections after they have all been closed. It must be
combined with --listen. In this mode there is no way for
Ncat to know when its network input is finished, so it will
keep running until interrupted. This also means that it will
never close its output stream, so any program reading from
Ncat and looking for end-of-file will also hang.</p>

<p>--broker (Connection brokering) . Allow multiple parties
to connect to a centralised Ncat server and communicate with
each other. Ncat can broker communication between systems
that are behind a NAT or otherwise unable to directly
connect. This option is used in conjunction with --listen,
which causes the --listen port to have broker mode
enabled.</p>

<p>--chat (Ad-hoc chat server) . The --chat option enables
chat mode, intended for the exchange of text between several
users. In chat mode, connection brokering is turned on. Ncat
prefixes each message received with an ID before relaying it
to the other connections. The ID is unique for each
connected client. This helps distinguish who sent what.
Additionally, non-printing characters such as control
characters are escaped to keep them from doing damage to a
terminal.</p>

<p>SSL OPTIONS --ssl (Use SSL) . In connect mode, this
option transparently negotiates an SSL session with an SSL
server to securely encrypt the connection. This is
particularly handy for talking to SSL enabled HTTP servers,
etc.</p>

<p>In server mode, this option listens for incoming SSL
connections, rather than plain untunneled traffic.</p>

<p>--ssl-verify (Verify server certificates) . In client
mode, --ssl-verify is like --ssl except that it also
requires verification of the server certificate. Ncat comes
with a default set of trusted certificates in the file
ca-bundle.crt. --ssl-trustfile to give a custom list. Use -v
one or more times to get details about verification
failures.</p>

<p>This option has no effect in server mode.</p>

<p>--ssl-cert certfile.pem (Specify SSL certificate) . This
option gives the location of a PEM-encoded certificate files
used to authenticate the server (in listen mode) or the
client (in connect mode). Use it in combination with
--ssl-key.</p>

<p>--ssl-key keyfile.pem (Specify SSL private key) . This
option gives the location of the PEM-encoded private key
file that goes with the certificate named with
--ssl-cert.</p>

<p>--ssl-trustfile cert.pem (List trusted certificates) .
This option sets a list of certificates that are trusted for
purposes of certificate verification. It has no effect
unless combined with --ssl-verify. The argument to this
option is the name of a PEM. file containing trusted
certificates. Typically, the file will contain certificates
of certification authorities, though it may also contain
server certificates directly. When this option is used, Ncat
does not use its default certificates.</p>

<p>PROXY OPTIONS --proxy host[:port] (Specify proxy
address) . Requests proxying through host:port, using the
protocol specified by --proxy-type.</p>

<p>If no port is specified, the proxy protocol&acute;s
well-known port is used (1080 for SOCKS and 3128 for HTTP).
However, when specifying an IPv6 HTTP proxy server using the
IP address rather than the hostname, the port number MUST be
specified as well. If the proxy requires authentication, use
--proxy-auth.</p>

<p>--proxy-type proto (Specify proxy protocol) . In connect
mode, this option requests the protocol proto to connect
through the proxy host specified by --proxy. In listen mode,
this option has Ncat act as a proxy server using the
specified protocol.</p>

<p>The currently available protocols in connect mode are
http (CONNECT) and socks4 (SOCKSv4). The only server
currently supported is http. If this option is not used, the
default protocol is http.</p>

<p>--proxy-auth user[:pass] (Specify proxy credentials) .
In connect mode, gives the credentials that will be used to
connect to the proxy server. In listen mode, gives the
credentials that will be required of connecting clients. For
use with --proxy-type http, the form should be user:pass.
For --proxy-type socks4, it should be a username only.</p>

<p>COMMAND EXECUTION OPTIONS -e command, --exec command
(Execute command) . Execute the specified command after a
connection has been established. The command must be
specified as a full pathname. All input from the remote
client will be sent to the application and responses sent
back to the remote client over the socket, thus making your
command-line application interactive over a socket. Combined
with --keep-open, Ncat will handle multiple simultaneous
connections to your specified port/application like inetd.
Ncat will only accept a maximum, definable, number of
simultaneous connections controlled by the -m option. By
default this is set to 100.</p>

<p>-c command, --sh-exec command (Execute command via sh) .
Same as -e, except it tries to execute the command via
/bin/sh. This means you don&acute;t have to specify the full
path for the command, and shell facilities like environment
variables are available.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL OPTIONS --allow host[,host,...] (Allow
connections) . The list of hosts specified will be the only
hosts allowed to connect to the Ncat process. All other
connection attempts will be disconnected. In case of a
conflict between --allow and --deny, --allow takes
precedence. Host specifications follow the same syntax used
by Nmap.</p>

<p>--allowfile file (Allow connections from file) . This
has the same functionality as --allow, except that the
allowed hosts are provided in a new-line delimited allow
file, rather than directly on the command line.</p>

<p>--deny host[,host,...] (Deny connections) . Issue Ncat
with a list of hosts that will not be allowed to connect to
the listening Ncat process. Specified hosts will have their
session silently terminated if they try to connect. be
disconnected. In case of a conflict between --allow and
--deny, --allow takes precedence. Host specifications follow
the same syntax used by Nmap.</p>

<p>--denyfile file (Deny connections from file) . This is
the same functionality as --deny, except that excluded hosts
are provided in a new-line delimited deny file, rather than
directly on the command line.</p>

<p>TIMING OPTIONS These options accept a time parameter.
This is specified in seconds by default, though you can
append ms, s, m, or h to the value to specify milliseconds,
seconds, minutes, or hours.</p>

<p>-d time, --delay time (Specify line delay) . Set the
delay interval for lines sent. This effectively limits the
number of lines that Ncat will send in the specified period.
This may be useful for low-bandwidth sites, or have other
uses such as coping with annoying iptables --limit
options.</p>

<p>-i time, --idle-timeout time (Specify idle timeout) .
Set a fixed timeout for idle connections. If the idle
timeout is reached, the connection is terminated.</p>

<p>-w time, --wait time (Specify connect timeout) . Set a
fixed timeout for connection attempts.</p>

<p>OUTPUT OPTIONS -o file, --output file (Save session
data) . Dump session data to a file</p>

<p>-x file, --hex-dump file (Save session data in hex) .
Dump session data in hex to a file. This can be used to
replay sessions.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose (Be verbose) . Issue Ncat with -v and it
will be verbose and display all kinds of useful connection
based information. Use more than once (-vv, -vvv) for
greater verbosity. -vvv is the maximum level.</p>

<p>MISC OPTIONS -C, --crlf (Use CRLF as EOL) . This option
tells Ncat to convert LF. line endings to CRLF. when taking
input from standard input.. This is useful for talking to
some stringent servers directly from a terminal in one of
the many common plain-text protocols that use CRLF for
end-of-line.</p>

<p>-h, --help (Help screen) . Displays a short help screen
with common options and parameters, and then exits.</p>

<p>--recv-only (Only receive data) . If this option is
passed, Ncat will only receive data and will not try to send
anything.</p>

<p>--send-only (Only send data) . If this option is passed,
then Ncat will only send data and will ignore anything
received. This option also causes Ncat to close the network
connection and terminate after EOF is received on standard
input.</p>

<p>-t, --telnet (Answer Telnet negotiations) . Handle
DO/DONT WILL/WONT Telnet negotiations. This makes it
possible to script Telnet sessions with Ncat.</p>

<p>--version (Display version) . Displays the Ncat version
number and exits.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The exit code reflects whether a connection
was made and completed successfully. 0 means there was no
error. 1 means there was a network error of some kind, for
example Connection refused or Connection reset. 2 is
reserved for all other errors, like an invalid option or a
nonexistent file.</p>

<p>BUGS Like its authors, Ncat isn&acute;t perfect. But you
can help make it better by sending bug reports or even
writing patches. If Ncat doesn&acute;t behave the way you
expect, first upgrade to the latest version available from
http://nmap.org. If the problem persists, do some research
to determine whether it has already been discovered and
addressed. Try Googling the error message or browsing the
nmap-dev archives at http://seclists.org/. Read this full
manual page as well. If nothing comes of this, mail a bug
report to nmap-dev@insecure.org. Please include everything
you have learned about the problem, as well as what version
of Ncat you are running and what operating system version it
is running on. Problem reports and Ncat usage questions sent
to nmap-dev@insecure.org are far more likely to be answered
than those sent to Fyodor directly.</p>

<p>Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug
reports. Basic instructions for creating patch files with
your changes are available at http://nmap.org/data/HACKING.
Patches may be sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to Fyodor
directly.</p>
