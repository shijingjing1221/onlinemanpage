<p>NAME dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol
allows the client to receive options from the DHCP server
describing the network configuration and various services
that are available on the network. When configuring dhcpd(8)
or dhclient(8) , options must often be declared. The syntax
for declaring options, and the names and formats of the
options that can be declared, are documented here.</p>

<p>REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS DHCP option statements
always start with the option keyword, followed by an option
name, followed by option data. The option names and data
formats are described below. It is not necessary to
exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those options
which are needed by clients must be specified.</p>

<p>Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined
below:</p>

<p>The ip-address data type can be entered either as an
explicit IP address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain
name (e.g., haa- gen.isc.org). When entering a domain name,
be sure that that domain name resolves to a single IP
address.</p>

<p>The ip6-address data specifies an IPv6 address, like ::1
or 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1.</p>

<p>The int32 data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.
The uint32 data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.
The int16 and uint16 data types specify signed and unsigned
16-bit integers. The int8 and uint8 data types specify
signed and unsigned 8-bit integers. Unsigned 8-bit integers
are also sometimes referred to as octets.</p>

<p>The text data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which
must be enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify
a root-path option, the syntax would be</p>

<p>option root-path
&quot;10.0.1.4:/var/tmp/rootfs&quot;;</p>

<p>The domain-name data type specifies a domain name, which
must not be enclosed in double quotes. This data type is not
used for any exist- ing DHCP options. The domain name is
stored just as if it were a text option.</p>

<p>The domain-list data type specifies a list of domain
names, enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas
(&quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;foo.exam-
ple.com&quot;).</p>

<p>The flag data type specifies a boolean value. Booleans
can be either true or false (or on or off, if that makes
more sense to you).</p>

<p>The string data type specifies either an NVT ASCII
string enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets
specified in hexadecimal, sepa- rated by colons. For
example:</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier &quot;CLIENT-FOO&quot;; or
option dhcp-client-identifier
43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;</p>

<p>The destination-descriptor describe the IP subnet number
and subnet mask of a particular destination using a compact
encoding. This encoding consists of one octet describing the
width of the subnet mask, followed by all the significant
octets of the subnet number. The fol- lowing table contains
some examples of how various subnet number/mask combinations
can be encoded:</p>

<p>Subnet number Subnet mask Destination descriptor 0 0 0
10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 8.10 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 24.10.0.0
10.17.0.0 255.255.0.0 16.10.17 10.27.129.0 255.255.255.0
24.10.27.129 10.229.0.128 255.255.255.128 25.10.229.0.128
10.198.122.47 255.255.255.255 32.10.198.122.47</p>

<p>SETTING OPTION VALUES USING EXPRESSIONS Sometimes its
helpful to be able to set the value of a DHCP option based
on some value that the client has sent. To do this, you can
use expression evaluation. The dhcp-eval(5) manual page
describes how to write expressions. To assign the result of
an evaluation to an option, define the option as
follows:</p>

<p>option my-option = expression ;</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>option hostname = binary-to-ascii (16, 8, &quot;-&quot;,
substring (hardware, 1, 6));</p>

<p>STANDARD DHCPV4 OPTIONS The documentation for the
various options mentioned below is taken from the latest
IETF draft document on DHCP options. Options not listed
below may not yet be implemented, but it is possible to use
such options by defining them in the configuration file.
Please see the DEFINING NEW OPTIONS heading later in this
document for more informa- tion.</p>

<p>Some of the options documented here are automatically
generated by the DHCP server or by clients, and cannot be
configured by the user. The value of such an option can be
used in the configuration file of the receiving DHCP
protocol agent (server or client), for example in condi-
tional expressions. However, the value of the option cannot
be used in the configuration file of the sending agent,
because the value is determined only after the configuration
file has been processed. In the following documentation,
such options will be shown as &quot;not user con-
figurable&quot;</p>

<p>The standard options are:</p>

<p>option all-subnets-local flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client may
assume that all subnets of the IP network to which the
client is connected use the same MTU as the subnet of that
network to which the client is directly connected. A value
of true indicates that all subnets share the same MTU. A
value of false means that the client should assume that some
subnets of the directly connected network may have smaller
MTUs.</p>

<p>option arp-cache-timeout uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP
cache entries.</p>

<p>option bcms-controller-address ip-address [,
ip-address... ];</p>

<p>This option configures a list of IPv4 addresses for use
as Broadcast and Multicast Controller Servers
(&quot;BCMS&quot;).</p>

<p>option bcms-controller-names domain-list;</p>

<p>This option contains the domain names of local Broadcast
and Multi- cast Controller Servers (&quot;BCMS&quot;)
controllers which the client may use.</p>

<p>option bootfile-name text;</p>

<p>This option is used to identify a bootstrap file. If
supported by the client, it should have the same effect as
the filename declara- tion. BOOTP clients are unlikely to
support this option. Some DHCP clients will support it, and
others actually require it.</p>

<p>option boot-size uint16;</p>

<p>This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of
the default boot image for the client.</p>

<p>option broadcast-address ip-address;</p>

<p>This option specifies the broadcast address in use on
the clients subnet. Legal values for broadcast addresses are
specified in sec- tion 3.2.1.3 of STD 3 (RFC1122).</p>

<p>option cookie-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The cookie server option specifies a list of RFC 865
cookie servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option default-ip-ttl uint8;</p>

<p>This option specifies the default time-to-live that the
client should use on outgoing datagrams.</p>

<p>option default-tcp-ttl uint8;</p>

<p>This option specifies the default TTL that the client
should use when sending TCP segments. The minimum value is
1.</p>

<p>option default-url string;</p>

<p>The format and meaning of this option is not described
in any stan- dards document, but is claimed to be in use by
Apple Computer. It is not known what clients may reasonably
do if supplied with this option. Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier string;</p>

<p>This option can be used to specify a DHCP client
identifier in a host declaration, so that dhcpd can find the
host record by matching against the client identifier.</p>

<p>Please be aware that some DHCP clients, when configured
with client identifiers that are ASCII text, will prepend a
zero to the ASCII text. So you may need to write:</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier &quot; foo&quot;;</p>

<p>rather than:</p>

<p>option dhcp-client-identifier &quot;foo&quot;;</p>

<p>option dhcp-lease-time uint32;</p>

<p>This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or
DHCPRE- QUEST) to allow the client to request a lease time
for the IP address. In a server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP
server uses this option to specify the lease time it is
willing to offer.</p>

<p>This option is not directly user configurable in the
server; refer to the max-lease-time and default-lease-time
server options in dhcpd.conf(5).</p>

<p>option dhcp-max-message-size uint16;</p>

<p>This option, when sent by the client, specifies the
maximum size of any response that the server sends to the
client. When specified on the server, if the client did not
send a dhcp-max-message-size option, the size specified on
the server is used. This works for BOOTP as well as DHCP
responses.</p>

<p>option dhcp-message text;</p>

<p>This option is used by a DHCP server to provide an error
message to a DHCP client in a DHCPNAK message in the event
of a failure. A client may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE
message to indicate why the client declined the offered
parameters.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-message-type uint8;</p>

<p>This option, sent by both client and server, specifies
the type of DHCP message contained in the DHCP packet.
Possible values (taken directly from RFC2132) are:</p>

<p>1 DHCPDISCOVER 2 DHCPOFFER 3 DHCPREQUEST 4 DHCPDECLINE 5
DHCPACK 6 DHCPNAK 7 DHCPRELEASE 8 DHCPINFORM</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-option-overload uint8;</p>

<p>This option is used to indicate that the DHCP sname or
file fields are being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP
options. A DHCP server inserts this option if the returned
parameters will exceed the usual space allotted for
options.</p>

<p>If this option is present, the client interprets the
specified addi- tional fields after it concludes
interpretation of the standard option fields.</p>

<p>Legal values for this option are:</p>

<p>1 the file field is used to hold options 2 the sname
field is used to hold options 3 both fields are used to hold
options</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-parameter-request-list uint16 [, uint16...
];</p>

<p>This option, when sent by the client, specifies which
options the client wishes the server to return. Normally, in
the ISC DHCP client, this is done using the request
statement. If this option is not specified by the client,
the DHCP server will normally return every option that is
valid in scope and that fits into the reply. When this
option is specified on the server, the server returns the
specified options. This can be used to force a client to
take options that it hasnt requested, and it can also be
used to tailor the response of the DHCP server for clients
that may need a more limited set of options than those the
server would normally return.</p>

<p>option dhcp-rebinding-time uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the number of seconds from the
time a client gets an address until the client transitions
to the REBINDING state.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-renewal-time uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the number of seconds from the
time a client gets an address until the client transitions
to the RENEWING state.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-requested-address ip-address;</p>

<p>This option is used by the client in a DHCPDISCOVER to
request that a particular IP address be assigned.</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable.</p>

<p>option dhcp-server-identifier ip-address;</p>

<p>This option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST
messages, and may optionally be included in the DHCPACK and
DHCPNAK messages. DHCP servers include this option in the
DHCPOFFER in order to allow the client to distinguish
between lease offers. DHCP clients use the contents of the
server identifier field as the destination address for any
DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server. DHCP clients also
indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted by
includ- ing this option in a DHCPREQUEST message.</p>

<p>The value of this option is the IP address of the
server.</p>

<p>This option is not directly user configurable. See the
server-iden- tifier server option in dhcpd.conf(5).</p>

<p>option domain-name text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the domain name that client should
use when resolving hostnames via the Domain Name System.</p>

<p>option domain-name-servers ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>The domain-name-servers option specifies a list of
Domain Name Sys- tem (STD 13, RFC 1035) name servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option domain-search domain-list;</p>

<p>The domain-search option specifies a search list of
Domain Names to be used by the client to locate
not-fully-qualified domain names. The difference between
this option and historic use of the domain- name option for
the same ends is that this option is encoded in RFC1035
compressed labels on the wire. For example:</p>

<p>option domain-search &quot;example.com&quot;,
&quot;sales.example.com&quot;,
&quot;eng.example.com&quot;;</p>

<p>option extensions-path text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the name of a file containing
additional options to be interpreted according to the DHCP
option format as specified in RFC2132.</p>

<p>option finger-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The Finger server option specifies a list of Finger
servers avail- able to the client. Servers should be listed
in order of prefer- ence.</p>

<p>option font-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of X Window System Font
servers avail- able to the client. Servers should be listed
in order of preference.</p>

<p>option host-name string;</p>

<p>This option specifies the name of the client. The name
may or may not be qualified with the local domain name (it
is preferable to use the domain-name option to specify the
domain name). See RFC 1035 for character set restrictions.
This option is only honored by dhclient-script(8) if the
hostname for the client machine is not set.</p>

<p>option ieee802-3-encapsulation flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
use Ethernet Version 2 (RFC 894) or IEEE 802.3 (RFC 1042)
encapsulation if the interface is an Ethernet. A value of
false indicates that the client should use RFC 894
encapsulation. A value of true means that the client should
use RFC 1042 encapsulation.</p>

<p>option ien116-name-servers ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>The ien116-name-servers option specifies a list of IEN
116 name servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of preference.</p>

<p>option impress-servers ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>The impress-server option specifies a list of Imagen
Impress servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option interface-mtu uint16;</p>

<p>This option specifies the MTU to use on this interface.
The mini- mum legal value for the MTU is 68.</p>

<p>option ip-forwarding flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether the client should
configure its IP layer for packet forwarding. A value of
false means disable IP for- warding, and a value of true
means enable IP forwarding.</p>

<p>option irc-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The IRC server option specifies a list of IRC servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option log-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The log-server option specifies a list of MIT-LCS UDP
log servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option lpr-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The LPR server option specifies a list of RFC 1179 line
printer servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of preference.</p>

<p>option mask-supplier flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
respond to subnet mask requests using ICMP. A value of false
indicates that the client should not respond. A value of
true means that the client should respond.</p>

<p>option max-dgram-reassembly uint16;</p>

<p>This option specifies the maximum size datagram that the
client should be prepared to reassemble. The minimum legal
value is 576.</p>

<p>option merit-dump text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the path-name of a file to which
the clients core image should be dumped in the event the
client crashes. The path is formatted as a character string
consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character
set.</p>

<p>option mobile-ip-home-agent ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating
mobile IP home agents available to the client. Agents should
be listed in order of preference, although normally there
will be only one such agent.</p>

<p>option nds-context string;</p>

Netware Directory Service for an NDS client.</p>

<p>option nds-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The nds-servers option specifies a list of IP addresses
of NDS servers.</p>

<p>option nds-tree-name string;</p>

<p>The nds-tree-name option specifies NDS tree name that
the NDS client should use.</p>

<p>option netbios-dd-server ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>The NetBIOS datagram distribution server (NBDD) option
specifies a list of RFC 1001/1002 NBDD servers listed in
order of preference.</p>

<p>option netbios-name-servers ip-address [,
ip-address...];</p>

<p>The NetBIOS name server (NBNS) option specifies a list
of RFC 1001/1002 NBNS name servers listed in order of
preference. NetBIOS Name Service is currently more commonly
referred to as WINS. WINS servers can be specified using the
netbios-name-servers option.</p>

<p>option netbios-node-type uint8;</p>

<p>The NetBIOS node type option allows NetBIOS over TCP/IP
clients which are configurable to be configured as described
in RFC 1001/1002. The value is specified as a single octet
which identi- fies the client type.</p>

<p>Possible node types are:</p>

<p>1 B-node: Broadcast - no WINS</p>

<p>2 P-node: Peer - WINS only</p>

<p>4 M-node: Mixed - broadcast, then WINS</p>

<p>8 H-node: Hybrid - WINS, then broadcast</p>

<p>option netbios-scope string;</p>

<p>The NetBIOS scope option specifies the NetBIOS over
TCP/IP scope parameter for the client as specified in RFC
1001/1002. See RFC1001, RFC1002, and RFC1035 for
character-set restrictions.</p>

<p>option netinfo-server-address ip-address [,
ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The netinfo-server-address option has not been described
in any RFC, but has been allocated (and is claimed to be in
use) by Apple Com- puters. Its hard to say if the above is
the correct format, or what clients might be expected to do
if values were configured. Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>option netinfo-server-tag text;</p>

<p>The netinfo-server-tag option has not been described in
any RFC, but has been allocated (and is claimed to be in
use) by Apple Computers. Its hard to say if the above is the
correct format, or what clients might be expected to do if
values were configured. Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>option nis-domain text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the name of the clients NIS (Sun
Network Information Services) domain. The domain is
formatted as a charac- ter string consisting of characters
from the NVT ASCII character set.</p>

<p>option nis-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option non-local-source-routing flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether the client should
configure its IP layer to allow forwarding of datagrams with
non-local source routes (see Section 3.3.5 of [4] for a
discussion of this topic). A value of false means disallow
forwarding of such datagrams, and a value of true means
allow forwarding.</p>

<p>option ntp-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The name of the NetWare/IP domain that a NetWare/IP
client should use.</p>

<p>option nwip-suboptions string;</p>

<p>A sequence of suboptions for NetWare/IP clients - see
RFC2242 for details. Normally this option is set by
specifying specific Net- Ware/IP suboptions - see the
NETWARE/IP SUBOPTIONS section for more information.</p>

<p>option path-mtu-aging-timeout uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the timeout (in seconds) to use
when aging Path MTU values discovered by the mechanism
defined in RFC 1191.</p>

<p>option path-mtu-plateau-table uint16 [, uint16... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies a table of MTU sizes to use when
performing Path MTU Discovery as defined in RFC 1191. The
table is formatted as a list of 16-bit unsigned integers,
ordered from smallest to largest. The minimum MTU value
cannot be smaller than 68.</p>

<p>option perform-mask-discovery flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
perform sub- net mask discovery using ICMP. A value of false
indicates that the client should not perform mask discovery.
A value of true means that the client should perform mask
discovery.</p>

<p>option policy-filter ip-address ip-address [, ip-address
ip-address...];</p>

<p>This option specifies policy filters for non-local
source routing. The filters consist of a list of IP
addresses and masks which spec- ify destination/mask pairs
with which to filter incoming source routes.</p>

<p>Any source routed datagram whose next-hop address does
not match one of the filters should be discarded by the
client.</p>

<p>See STD 3 (RFC1122) for further information.</p>

<p>option pop-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The POP3 server option specifies a list of POP3 servers

<p>This option specifies a list of RFC 887 Resource
Location servers available to the client. Servers should be
listed in order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option root-path text;</p>

<p>This option specifies the path-name that contains the

string consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character
set.</p>

<p>option router-discovery flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
solicit routers using the Router Discovery mechanism defined
in RFC 1256. A value of false indicates that the client
should not perform router discovery. A value of true means
that the client should perform router discovery.</p>

<p>option router-solicitation-address ip-address;</p>

<p>This option specifies the address to which the client
should trans- mit router solicitation requests.</p>

<p>option routers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The routers option specifies a list of IP addresses for
routers on the clients subnet. Routers should be listed in
order of prefer- ence.</p>

<p>option slp-directory-agent boolean ip-address [,
ip-address... ];</p>

<p>This option specifies two things: the IP addresses of
one or more Service Location Protocol Directory Agents, and
whether the use of these addresses is mandatory. If the
initial boolean value is true, the SLP agent should just use
the IP addresses given. If the value is false, the SLP agent
may additionally do active or passive multicast discovery of
SLP agents (see RFC2165 for details).</p>

<p>Please note that in this option and the
slp-service-scope option, the term &quot;SLP Agent&quot; is
being used to refer to a Service Location Protocol agent
running on a machine that is being configured using the DHCP
protocol.</p>

<p>Also, please be aware that some companies may refer to
SLP as NDS. If you have an NDS directory agent whose address
you need to config- ure, the slp-directory-agent option
should work.</p>

<p>option slp-service-scope boolean text;</p>

<p>The Service Location Protocol Service Scope Option
specifies two things: a list of service scopes for SLP, and
whether the use of this list is mandatory. If the initial
boolean value is true, the SLP agent should only use the
list of scopes provided in this option; otherwise, it may
use its own static configuration in pref- erence to the list
provided in this option.</p>

<p>The text string should be a comma-separated list of
scopes that the SLP agent should use. It may be omitted, in
which case the SLP Agent will use the aggregated list of
scopes of all directory agents known to the SLP agent.</p>

<p>option smtp-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The SMTP server option specifies a list of SMTP servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option static-routes ip-address ip-address [, ip-address
ip-address...];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of static routes that the
client should install in its routing cache. If multiple
routes to the same desti- nation are specified, they are
listed in descending order of prior- ity.</p>

<p>The routes consist of a list of IP address pairs. The
first address is the destination address, and the second
address is the router for the destination.</p>

<p>The default route (0.0.0.0) is an illegal destination
for a static route. To specify the default route, use the
routers option. Also, please note that this option is not
intended for classless IP routing - it does not include a
subnet mask. Since classless IP routing is now the most
widely deployed routing standard, this option is virtually
useless, and is not implemented by any of the popular DHCP
clients, for example the Microsoft DHCP client.</p>

<p>NOTE to Fedora dhclient users: dhclient-script
interprets trailing 0 octets of the target as indi- cating
the subnet class of the route, so for the following static-
routes value: option static-routes 172.0.0.0 172.16.2.254,
192.168.0.0 192.168.2.254; dhclient-script will create
routes: 172/8 via 172.16.2.254 dev $interface 192.168/16 via
192.168.2.254 dev $interface</p>

<p>option classless-static-routes destination-descriptor
ip-address [, destination-descriptor ip-address...];</p>

<p>This option (see RFC3442) specifies a list of classless
static routes that the client should install in its routing
cache.</p>

<p>This option can contain one or more static routes, each
of which consists of a destination descriptor and the IP
address of the router that should be used to reach that
destination.</p>

<p>Many clients may not implement the Classless Static
Routes option. DHCP server administrators should therefore
configure their DHCP servers to send both a Router option
and a Classless Static Routes option, and should specify the
default router(s) both in the Router option and in the
Classless Static Routes option.</p>

<p>If the DHCP server returns both a Classless Static
Routes option and a Router option, the DHCP client ignores
the Router option.</p>

<p>option streettalk-directory-assistance-server ip-address
[, ip-address...];</p>

<p>The StreetTalk Directory Assistance (STDA) server option
specifies a list of STDA servers available to the client.
Servers should be listed in order of preference.</p>

<p>option streettalk-server ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>The StreetTalk server option specifies a list of
StreetTalk servers available to the client. Servers should
be listed in order of preference.</p>

<p>option subnet-mask ip-address;</p>

<p>The subnet mask option specifies the clients subnet mask
as per RFC 950. If no subnet mask option is provided
anywhere in scope, as a last resort dhcpd will use the
subnet mask from the subnet declara- tion for the network on
which an address is being assigned. How- ever, any
subnet-mask option declaration that is in scope for the
address being assigned will override the subnet mask
specified in the subnet declaration.</p>

<p>option subnet-selection string;</p>

<p>Sent by the client if an address is required in a subnet
other than the one that would normally be selected (based on
the relaying address of the connected subnet the request is
obtained from). See RFC3011. Note that the option number
used by this server is 118; this has not always been the
defined number, and some clients may use a different value.
Use of this option should be regarded as slightly
experimental!</p>

<p>This option is not user configurable in the server.</p>

<p>option swap-server ip-address;</p>

<p>This specifies the IP address of the clients swap
server.</p>

<p>option tcp-keepalive-garbage flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
send TCP keepalive messages with an octet of garbage for
compatibility with older implementations. A value of false
indicates that a garbage octet should not be sent. A value
of true indicates that a garbage octet should be sent.</p>

<p>option tcp-keepalive-interval uint32;</p>

<p>This option specifies the interval (in seconds) that the
client TCP should wait before sending a keepalive message on
a TCP connection. The time is specified as a 32-bit unsigned
integer. A value of zero indicates that the client should
not generate keepalive messages on connections unless
specifically requested by an application.</p>

<p>option tftp-server-name text;</p>

<p>This option is used to identify a TFTP server and, if
supported by the client, should have the same effect as the
server-name declara- tion. BOOTP clients are unlikely to
support this option. Some DHCP clients will support it, and
others actually require it.</p>

<p>option time-offset int32;</p>

<p>The time-offset option specifies the offset of the
clients subnet in seconds from Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC).</p>

<p>option time-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The time-server option specifies a list of RFC 868 time
servers available to the client. Servers should be listed in
order of pref- erence.</p>

<p>option trailer-encapsulation flag;</p>

<p>This option specifies whether or not the client should
negotiate the use of trailers (RFC 893 [14]) when using the
ARP protocol. A value of false indicates that the client
should not attempt to use trail- ers. A value of true means
that the client should attempt to use trailers.</p>

<p>option uap-servers text;</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of URLs, each pointing to a
user authentication service that is capable of processing
authentication requests encapsulated in the User
Authentication Protocol (UAP). UAP servers can accept either
HTTP 1.1 or SSLv3 connections. If the list includes a URL
that does not contain a port component, the nor- mal default
port is assumed (i.e., port 80 for http and port 443 for
https). If the list includes a URL that does not contain a
path component, the path /uap is assumed. If more than one
URL is spec- ified in this list, the URLs are separated by
spaces.</p>

<p>option user-class string;</p>

<p>This option is used by some DHCP clients as a way for
users to spec- ify identifying information to the client.
This can be used in a similar way to the
vendor-class-identifier option, but the value of the option
is specified by the user, not the vendor. Most recent DHCP
clients have a way in the user interface to specify the
value for this identifier, usually as a text string.</p>

<p>option vendor-class-identifier string;</p>

<p>This option is used by some DHCP clients to identify the
vendor type and possibly the configuration of a DHCP client.
The information is a string of bytes whose contents are
specific to the vendor and are not specified in a standard.
To see what vendor class identifier clients are sending, you
can write the following in your DHCP server configuration
file:</p>

<p>set vendor-string = option vendor-class-identifier;</p>

<p>This will result in all entries in the DHCP server lease
database file for clients that sent vendor-class-identifier
options having a set statement that looks something like
this:</p>

<p>set vendor-string = &quot;SUNW.Ultra-5_10&quot;;</p>

<p>The vendor-class-identifier option is normally used by
the DHCP server to determine the options that are returned
in the vendor- encapsulated-options option. Please see the
VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later in this manual
page for further information.</p>

<p>option vendor-encapsulated-options string;</p>

<p>The vendor-encapsulated-options option can contain
either a single vendor-specific value or one or more
vendor-specific suboptions. This option is not normally
specified in the DHCP server configura- tion file - instead,
a vendor class is defined for each vendor, ven- dor class
suboptions are defined, values for those suboptions are
defined, and the DHCP server makes up a response on that
basis.</p>

<p>Some default behaviours for well-known DHCP client
vendors (cur- rently, the Microsoft Windows 2000 DHCP
client) are configured auto- matically, but otherwise this
must be configured manually - see the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED
OPTIONS section later in this manual page for details.</p>

<p>option vivso string;</p>

<p>The vivso option can contain multiple separate options,
one for each 32-bit Enterprise ID. Each Enterprise-ID
discriminated option then contains additional options whose
format is defined by the vendor who holds that ID. This
option is usually not configured manually, but rather is
configured via intervening option definitions. Please also
see the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later in this
man- ual page for details.</p>

<p>option www-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];</p>

<p>The WWW server option specifies a list of WWW servers
available to the client. Servers should be listed in order
of preference.</p>

<p>option x-display-manager ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>This option specifies a list of systems that are running
the X Win- dow System Display Manager and are available to
the client. Addresses should be listed in order of
preference.</p>

<p>RELAY AGENT INFORMATION OPTION An IETF draft,
draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-11.txt, defines a series of
encapsulated options that a relay agent can add to a DHCP
packet when relaying it to the DHCP server. The server can
then make address allocation decisions (or whatever other
decisions it wants) based on these options. The server also
returns these options in any replies it sends through the
relay agent, so that the relay agent can use the information
in these options for delivery or accounting purposes.</p>

<p>The current draft defines two options. To reference
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space
name, &quot;agent&quot;, followed by a period, followed by
the option name. It is not normally useful to define values
for these options in the server, although it is permissi-
ble. These options are not supported in the client.</p>

<p>option agent.circuit-id string;</p>

<p>The circuit-id suboption encodes an agent-local
identifier of the circuit from which a DHCP client-to-server
packet was received. It is intended for use by agents in
relaying DHCP responses back to the proper circuit. The
format of this option is currently defined to be
vendor-dependent, and will probably remain that way,
although the current draft allows for for the possibility of
standardizing the format in the future.</p>

<p>option agent.remote-id string;</p>

<p>The remote-id suboption encodes information about the
remote host end of a circuit. Examples of what it might
contain include caller ID information, username information,
remote ATM address, cable modem ID, and similar things. In
principal, the meaning is not well-specified, and it should
generally be assumed to be an opaque object that is
administratively guaranteed to be unique to a partic- ular
remote end of a circuit.</p>

<p>option agent.DOCSIS-device-class uint32;</p>

<p>The DOCSIS-device-class suboption is intended to convey
information about the host endpoint, hardware, and software,
that either the host operating system or the DHCP server may
not otherwise be aware of (but the relay is able to
distinguish). This is implemented as a 32-bit field (4
octets), each bit representing a flag describing the host in
one of these ways. So far, only bit zero (being the least
significant bit) is defined in RFC3256. If this bit is set
to one, the host is considered a CPE Controlled Cable Modem
(CCCM). All other bits are reserved.</p>

<p>option agent.link-selection ip-address;</p>

<p>The link-selection suboption is provided by relay agents
to inform servers what subnet the client is actually
attached to. This is useful in those cases where the giaddr
(where responses must be sent to the relay agent) is not on
the same subnet as the client. When this option is present
in a packet from a relay agent, the DHCP server will use its
contents to find a subnet declared in configura- tion, and
from here take one step further backwards to any shared-
network the subnet may be defined within...the client may be
given any address within that shared network, as normally
appropriate.</p>

<p>THE CLIENT FQDN SUBOPTIONS The Client FQDN option,
currently defined in the Internet Draft draft-
ietf-dhc-fqdn-option-00.txt is not a standard yet, but is in
suffi- ciently wide use already that we have implemented it.
Due to the com- plexity of the option format, we have
implemented it as a suboption space rather than a single
option. In general this option should not be configured by
the user - instead it should be used as part of an automatic
DNS update system.</p>

<p>option fqdn.no-client-update flag;</p>

<p>When the client sends this, if it is true, it means the
client will not attempt to update its A record. When sent by
the server to the client, it means that the client should
not update its own A record.</p>

<p>option fqdn.server-update flag;</p>

<p>When the client sends this to the server, it is
requesting that the server update its A record. When sent by
the server, it means that the server has updated (or is
about to update) the clients A record.</p>

<p>option fqdn.encoded flag;</p>

<p>If true, this indicates that the domain name included in
the option is encoded in DNS wire format, rather than as
plain ASCII text. The client normally sets this to false if
it doesnt support DNS wire format in the FQDN option. The
server should always send back the same value that the
client sent. When this value is set on the configuration
side, it controls the format in which the fqdn.fqdn
suboption is encoded.</p>

<p>option fqdn.rcode1 flag;</p>

<p>option fqdn.rcode2 flag;</p>

<p>These options specify the result of the updates of the A
and PTR records, respectively, and are only sent by the DHCP
server to the DHCP client. The values of these fields are
those defined in the DNS protocol specification.</p>

<p>option fqdn.fqdn text;</p>

<p>Specifies the domain name that the client wishes to use.
This can be a fully-qualified domain name, or a single
label. If there is no trailing generally update that name in
some locally-defined domain.</p>

<p>option fqdn.hostname --never set--;</p>

<p>This option should never be set, but it can be read back
using the option and config-option operators in an
expression, in which case it returns the first label in the
fqdn.fqdn suboption - for example, if the value of fqdn.fqdn
is &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;, then fqdn.hostname will be
&quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p>option fqdn.domainname --never set--;</p>

<p>This option should never be set, but it can be read back
using the option and config-option operators in an
expression, in which case it returns all labels after the
first label in the fqdn.fqdn subop- tion - for example, if
the value of fqdn.fqdn is &quot;foo.example.com.&quot;, then
fqdn.hostname will be &quot;example.com.&quot;. If this
suboption value is not set, it means that an unqualified
name was sent in the fqdn option, or that no fqdn option was
sent at all.</p>

<p>If you wish to use any of these suboptions, we strongly
recommend that you refer to the Client FQDN option draft (or
standard, when it becomes a standard) - the documentation
here is sketchy and incomplete in com- parison, and is just
intended for reference by people who already understand the
Client FQDN option specification.</p>

<p>THE NETWARE/IP SUBOPTIONS RFC2242 defines a set of
encapsulated options for Novell NetWare/IP clients. To use
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space
name, &quot;nwip&quot;, followed by a period, followed by
the option name. The following options can be specified:</p>

<p>option nwip.nsq-broadcast flag;</p>

<p>If true, the client should use the NetWare Nearest
Server Query to locate a NetWare/IP server. The behaviour of
the Novell client if this suboption is false, or is not
present, is not specified.</p>

<p>option nwip.preferred-dss ip-address [, ip-address...
];</p>

<p>This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP
addresses, each of which should be the IP address of a
NetWare Domain SAP/RIP server (DSS).</p>

<p>option nwip.nearest-nwip-server ip-address [,
ip-address...];</p>

<p>This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP
addresses, each of which should be the IP address of a
Nearest NetWare IP server.</p>

<p>option nwip.autoretries uint8;</p>

<p>Specifies the number of times that a NetWare/IP client
should attempt to communicate with a given DSS server at
startup.</p>

<p>option nwip.autoretry-secs uint8;</p>

<p>Specifies the number of seconds that a Netware/IP client
should wait between retries when attempting to establish
communications with a DSS server at startup.</p>

<p>option nwip.nwip-1-1 uint8;</p>

<p>If true, the NetWare/IP client should support NetWare/IP
version 1.1 compatibility. This is only needed if the client
will be contact- ing Netware/IP version 1.1 servers.</p>

<p>option nwip.primary-dss ip-address;</p>

<p>Specifies the IP address of the Primary Domain SAP/RIP
Service server (DSS) for this NetWare/IP domain. The
NetWare/IP adminis- tration utility uses this value as
Primary DSS server when configur- ing a secondary DSS
server.</p>

<p>STANDARD DHCPV6 OPTIONS DHCPv6 options differ from
DHCPv4 options partially due to using 16-bit code and length
tags, but semantically zero-length options are legal in
DHCPv6, and multiple options are treated differently.
Whereas in DHCPv4 multiple options would be concatenated to
form one option, in DHCPv6 they are expected to be
individual instantiations. Understand- ably, many options
are not &quot;allowed&quot; to have multiple instances in a
packet - normally these are options which are digested by
the DHCP pro- tocol software, and not by users or
applications.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.client-id string;</p>

<p>This option specifies the client s DUID identifier.
DUIDs are simi- lar but different from DHCPv4 client
identifiers - there are docu- mented duid types:</p>

<p>duid-llt</p>

<p>duid-en</p>

<p>duid-ll</p>

<p>This value should not be configured, but rather is
provided by clients and treated as an opaque identifier key
blob by servers.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.server-id string;</p>

<p>This option specifies the servers DUID identifier. One
may use this option to configure an opaque binary blob for
your servers identifier.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.ia-na string;</p>

<p>The Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses
(ia-na) carries assigned addresses that are not temporary
addresses for use by the DHCPv6 client. This option is
produced by the DHCPv6 server soft- ware, and should not be
configured.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.ia-ta string;</p>

<p>The Identity Association for Temporary Addresses (ia-ta)
carries temporary addresses, which may change upon every
renewal. There is no support for this in the current DHCPv6
software.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.ia-addr string;</p>

<p>The Identity Association Address option is encapsulated
inside ia-na or ia-ta options in order to represent
addresses associated with those IA s. These options are
manufactured by the software, so should not be
configured.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.oro uint16 [ , uint16, ... ];</p>

<p>The Option Request Option (&quot;ORO&quot;) is the
DHCPv6 equivalent of the parameter-request-list. Clients
supply this option to ask servers to reply with options
relevant to their needs and use. This option must not be
directly configured, the request syntax in dhclient.conf (5)
should be used instead.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.preference uint8;</p>

<p>The preference option informs a DHCPv6 client which
server is applied during the initial stages of configuration
- once a client is bound to an IA, it will remain bound to
that IA until it is no longer valid or has expired. This
value may be configured on the server, and is digested by
the client software.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.elapsed-time uint16;</p>

<p>The elapsed-time option is constructed by the DHCPv6
client soft- ware, and is potentially consumed by
intermediaries. This option should not be configured.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.relay-msg string;</p>

<p>The relay-msg option is constructed by intervening
DHCPv6 relay agent software. This option is entirely used by
protocol software, and is not meant for user
configuration.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.unicast ip6-address;</p>

<p>The unicast option is provided by DHCPv6 servers which
are willing (or prefer) to receive Renew packets from their
clients by exchang- ing UDP unicasts with them. Normally,
DHCPv6 clients will multicast their Renew messages. This may
be configured on the server, and should be configured as an
address the server is ready to reply to.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.status-code status-code [ string ] ;</p>

<p>The status-code option is provided by DHCPv6 servers to
inform clients of error conditions during protocol
communication. This option is manufactured and digested by
protocol software, and should not be configured.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.rapid-commit ;</p>

<p>The rapid-commit option is a zero-length option that
clients use to indicate their desire to enter into
rapid-commit with the server. This option is not supported
by the client at this time, and is digested by the server
when present, so should not be configured.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.vendor-opts string;</p>

<p>The vendor-opts option is actually an encapsulated
sub-option space, in which each Vendor-specific Information
Option (VSIO) is identi- fied by a 32-bit Enterprise-ID
number. The encapsulated option spaces within these options
are defined by the vendors.</p>

<p>To make use of this option, the best way is to examine
the section titled VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS below, in
particular the bits about the &quot;vsio&quot; option
space.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.interface-id string;</p>

<p>The interface-id option is manufactured by relay agents,
and may be used to guide configuration differentiating
clients by the interface they are remotely attached to. It
does not make sense to configure a value for this option,
but it may make sense to inspect its con- tents.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.reconf-msg dhcpv6-message;</p>

<p>The reconf-msg option is manufactured by servers, and
sent to clients in Reconfigure messages to inform them of
what message the client should Reconfigure using. There is
no support for DHCPv6 Reconfigure extensions, and this
option is documented information- ally only.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.reconf-accept ;</p>

<p>The reconf-accept option is included by DHCPv6 clients
that support the Reconfigure extentions, advertising that
they will respond if the server were to ask them to
Reconfigure. There is no support for DHCPv6 Reconfigure
extensions, and this option is documented infor- mationally
only.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.sip-servers-names domain-list;</p>

<p>The sip-servers-names option allows SIP clients to
locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all
outbound SIP requests, a so- called&quot;outbound proxy
server.&quot; If you wish to use manually entered IPv6
addresses instead, please see the sip-servers-addresses
option below.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.sip-servers-addresses ip6-address [,
ip6-address ... ] ;</p>

<p>The sip-servers-addresses option allows SIP clients to
locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all
outbound SIP requests, a so-called &quot;outbound proxy
servers.&quot; If you wish to use domain names rather than
IPv6 addresses, please see the sip-servers-names option
above.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.name-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ...
] ;</p>

<p>The name-servers option instructs clients about locally
available recursive DNS servers. It is easiest to describe
this as the &quot;name- server&quot; line in
/etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.domain-search domain-list;</p>

<p>The domain-search option specifies the clients domain
search path to be applied to recursive DNS queries. It is
easiest to describe this as the &quot;search&quot; line in
/etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.ia-pd string;</p>

<p>The ia-pd option is manufactured by clients and servers
to create a Prefix Delegation binding - to delegate an IPv6
prefix to the client. There is not yet any support for
prefix delegation in this software, and this option is
provided informationally only.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.ia-prefix string;</p>

<p>The ia-prefix option is placed inside ia-pd options in
order to identify the prefix(es) allocated to the client.
There is not yet any suport for prefix delegation in this
software, and this option is provided informationally
only.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.nis-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ...
] ;</p>

<p>The nis-servers option identifies, in order, NIS servers
available to the client.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.nisp-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ...
] ;</p>

<p>The nisp-servers option identifies, in order, NIS+
servers available to the client.</p>

<p>option nis-domain-name domain-list;</p>

<p>The nis-domain-name option specifies the NIS domain name
the client is expected to use, and is related to the
nis-servers option.</p>

<p>option nisp-domain-name domain-list;</p>

<p>The nisp-domain-name option specifies the NIS+ domain
name the client is expected to use, and is related to the
nisp-servers option.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.sntp-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ...
] ;</p>

<p>The sntp-servers option specifies a list of local SNTP
servers available for the client to synchronize their
clocks.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.info-refresh-time uint32;</p>

<p>The info-refresh-time option gives DHCPv6 clients using
Information- request messages a hint as to how long they
should between refresh- ing the information they were given.
Note that this option will only be delivered to the client,
and be likely to affect the client s behaviour, if the
client requested the option.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.bcms-server-d domain-list;</p>

<p>The bcms-server-d option contains the domain names of
local BCMS (Broadcast and Multicast Control Services)
controllers which the client may use.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.bcms-server-a ip6-address [, ip6-address
... ] ;</p>

<p>The bcms-server-a option contains the IPv6 addresses of
local BCMS (Broadcast and Multicast Control Services)
controllers which the client may use.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.remote-id string;</p>

<p>The remote-id option is constructed by relay agents, to
inform the server of details pertaining to what the relay
knows about the client (such as what port it is attached to,
and so forth). The contents of this option have some
vendor-specific structure (similar to VSIO), but we have
chosen to treat this option as an opaque field.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.subscriber-id;</p>

<p>The subscriber-id option is an opaque field provided by
the relay agent, which provides additional information about
the subscriber in question. The exact contents of this
option depend upon the vendor and/or the operator s
configuration of the remote device, and as such is an opaque
field.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.fqdn string;</p>

<p>The fqdn option is normally constructed by the client or
server, and negotiates the client s Fully Qualified Domain
Name, as well as which party is responsible for Dynamic DNS
Updates. See the section on the Client FQDN SubOptions for
full details (the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 FQDN options use the
same &quot;fqdn.&quot; encapsulated space, so are in all
ways identical).</p>

<p>option dhcp6.lq-query string;</p>

<p>The lq-query option is used internally by for lease
query.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.client-data string;</p>

<p>The client-data option is used internally by for lease
query.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.clt-time uint32;</p>

<p>The clt-time option is used internally by for lease
query.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.lq-relay-data ip6-address string;</p>

<p>The lq-relay-data option is used internally by for lease
query.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.lq-client-link ip6-address [, ip6-address
... ] ;</p>

<p>The lq-client-link option is used internally by for
lease query.</p>

<p>option dhcp6.bootfile-url string ;</p>

<p>The server sends this option to inform the client about
a URL to a boot file. Used primarily for UEFI network
booting, it contains an RFC3986 compliant URI which the
client may use to boot an operating system. This option is
defined in RFC5970</p>

<p>option dhcp6.arch-type arch-id [, arch-id...] ;</p>

<p>A client will send this option to a server so that the
server may make decisions on what options and addresses to
offer the requesting client. The option consists of a list
of 16 bit unsigned values that represent the architecture of
the requesting client. These values corespond to the values
available to the dhcpv4 option archi- tecture-type, as
defined in RFC4578, section 2.1. This option is defined in
RFC5970</p>

<p>option dhcp6.net-id uint8 uint8 uint8 ;</p>

<p>A client will send this option to a server to inform it
about the clients level of UNDI support. The option consists
of 3 octets (a type, major and minor value). Specific
meanings of these values are doumented in section 2.2 of
RFC4578. This option is defined in RFC5970</p>

<p>DEFINING NEW OPTIONS The Internet Systems Consortium
DHCP client and server provide the capability to define new
options. Each DHCP option has a name, a code, and a
structure. The name is used by you to refer to the option.
The code is a number, used by the DHCP server and client to
refer to an option. The structure describes what the
contents of an option looks like.</p>

<p>To define a new option, you need to choose a name for it
that is not in use for some other option - for example, you
cant use &quot;host-name&quot; because the DHCP protocol
already defines a host-name option, which is documented
earlier in this manual page. If an option name doesnt appear
in this manual page, you can use it, but its probably a good
idea to put some kind of unique string at the beginning so
you can be sure that future options don t take your name.
For example, you might define an option,
&quot;local-host-name&quot;, feeling some confidence that no
official DHCP option name will ever start with
&quot;local&quot;.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen a name, you must choose a code. All
codes between 224 and 254 are reserved as site-local DHCP
options, so you can pick any one of these for your site (not
for your product/application). In RFC3942, site-local space
was moved from starting at 128 to starting at 224. In
practice, some vendors have interpreted the protocol rather
loosely and have used option code values greater than 128
themselves. There s no real way to avoid this problem, and
it was thought to be unlikely to cause too much trouble in
practice. If you come across a vendor-documented option code
in either the new or old site-local spaces, please contact
your vendor and inform them about rfc3942.</p>

<p>The structure of an option is simply the format in which
the option data appears. The ISC DHCP server currently
supports a few simple types, like integers, booleans,
strings and IP addresses, and it also supports the ability
to define arrays of single types or arrays of fixed
sequences of types.</p>

<p>New options are declared as follows:</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = definition ;</p>

<p>The values of new-name and new-code should be the name
you have chosen for the new option and the code you have
chosen. The definition should be the definition of the
structure of the option.</p>

<p>The following simple option type definitions are
supported:</p>

<p>BOOLEAN</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = boolean ;</p>

<p>An option of type boolean is a flag with a value of
either on or off (or true or false). So an example use of
the boolean type would be:</p>

<p>option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean; option use-zephyr
on;</p>

<p>INTEGER</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = sign integer width ;</p>

<p>The sign token should either be blank, unsigned or
signed. The width can be either 8, 16 or 32, and refers to
the number of bits in the integer. So for example, the
following two lines show a definition of the
sql-connection-max option and its use:</p>

<p>option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer
16; option sql-connection-max 1536;</p>

<p>IP-ADDRESS</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = ip-address ;</p>

<p>An option whose structure is an IP address can be
expressed either as a domain name or as a dotted quad. So
the following is an example use of the ip-address type:</p>

<p>option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address; option
sql-server-address sql.example.com;</p>

<p>IP6-ADDRESS</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = ip6-address ;</p>

<p>An option whose structure is an IPv6 address must be
expressed as a valid IPv6 address. The following is an
example use of the ip6-address type:</p>

<p>option dhcp6.some-server code 1234 = array of
ip6-address; option dhcp6.some-server
3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1, 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::2;</p>

<p>TEXT</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = text ;</p>

<p>An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text
string. For example:</p>

<p>option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
option sql-default-connection-name &quot;PRODZA&quot;;</p>

<p>DATA STRING</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = string ;</p>

<p>An option whose type is a data string is essentially
just a collection of bytes, and can be specified either as
quoted text, like the text type, or as a list of hexadecimal
contents separated by colons whose values must be between 0
and FF. For example:</p>

<p>option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
option sql-identification-token
17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;</p>

<p>DOMAIN-LIST</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = domain-list [compressed]
;</p>

<p>An option whose type is domain-list is an RFC1035
formatted (on the wire, &quot;DNS Format&quot;) list of
domain names, separated by root labels. The optional
compressed keyword indicates if the option should be com-
pressed relative to the start of the option contents (not
the packet contents).</p>

<p>When in doubt, omit the compressed keyword. When the
software recieves an option that is compressed and the
compressed keyword is omitted, it will still decompress the
option (relative to the option contents field). The keyword
only controls whether or not transmitted packets are
compressed.</p>

<p>Note that when domain-list formatted options are output
as environment variables to dhclient-script(8), the standard
DNS -escape mechanism is used: they are decimal. This is
appropriate for direct use in eg /etc/resolv.conf.</p>

<p>ENCAPSULATION</p>

<p>option new-name code new-code = encapsulate identifier
;</p>

<p>An option whose type is encapsulate will encapsulate the
contents of the option space specified in identifier.
Examples of encapsulated options in the DHCP protocol as it
currently exists include the vendor- encapsulated-options
option, the netware-suboptions option and the
relay-agent-information option.</p>

<p>option space local; option local.demo code 1 = text;
option local-encapsulation code 197 = encapsulate local;
option local.demo &quot;demo&quot;;</p>

<p>ARRAYS</p>

<p>Options can contain arrays of any of the above types
except for the text and data string types, which aren t
currently supported in arrays. An example of an array
definition is as follows:</p>

<p>option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;</p>

<p>RECORDS</p>

<p>Options can also contain data structures consisting of a
sequence of data types, which is sometimes called a record
type. For example:</p>

<p>option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32,
text }; option contrived-001 on 1772
&quot;contrivance&quot;;</p>

<p>It s also possible to have options that are arrays of
records, for example:</p>

<p>option new-static-routes code 201 = array of {
ip-address, ip-address, ip-address, integer 8 }; option
static-routes 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 net-0-rtr.example.com
1, 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 net-1-rtr.example.com 1, 10.2.0.0
255.255.224.0 net-2-0-rtr.example.com 3;</p>

<p>VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS The DHCP protocol defines
the vendor-encapsulated-options option, which allows vendors
to define their own options that will be sent encapsu- lated
in a standard DHCP option. It also defines the Vendor
Identified Vendor Sub Options option (&quot;VIVSO&quot;),
and the DHCPv6 protocol defines the Vendor-specific
Information Option (&quot;VSIO&quot;). The format of all of
these options is usually internally a string of options,
similarly to other normal DHCP options. The VIVSO and VSIO
options differ in that that they contain options that
correspond to vendor Enterprise-ID num- bers (assigned by
IANA), which then contain options according to each Vendor s
specifications. You will need to refer to your vendors docu-
mentation in order to form options to their
specification.</p>

<p>The value of these options can be set in one of two
ways. The first way is to simply specify the data directly,
using a text string or a colon-separated list of hexadecimal
values. For help in forming these strings, please refer to
RFC2132 for the DHCPv4 Vendor Specific Infor- mation Option,
RFC3925 for the DHCPv4 Vendor Identified Vendor Sub Options,
or RFC3315 for the DHCPv6 Vendor-specific Information
Option. For example:</p>

<p>option vendor-encapsulated-options 2:4: AC:11:41:1:
3:12: 73:75:6e:64:68:63:70:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:31:37:2d:31:
4:12: 2f:65:78:70:6f:72:74:2f:72:6f:6f:74:2f:69:38:36:70:63;
option vivso 00:00:09:bf:0E: 01:0c:
48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21; option
dhcp6.vendor-opts 00:00:09:bf: 00:01:00:0c:
48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;</p>

<p>The second way of setting the value of these options is
to have the DHCP server generate a vendor-specific option
buffer. To do this, you must do four things: define an
option space, define some options in that option space,
provide values for them, and specify that that option space
should be used to generate the relevant option.</p>

<p>To define a new option space in which vendor options can
be stored, use the option space statement:</p>

<p>option space name [ [ code width number ] [ length width
number ] [ hash size number ] ] ;</p>

<p>Where the numbers following code width, length width,
and hash size respectively identify the number of bytes used
to describe option codes, option lengths, and the size in
buckets of the hash tables to hold options in this space
(most DHCPv4 option spaces use 1 byte codes and lengths,
which is the default, whereas most DHCPv6 option spaces use
2 byte codes and lengths).</p>

<p>The code and length widths are used in DHCP protocol -
you must config- ure these numbers to match the applicable
option space you are config- uring. They each default to 1.
Valid values for code widths are 1, 2 or 4. Valid values for
length widths are 0, 1 or 2. Most DHCPv4 option spaces use 1
byte codes and lengths, which is the default, whereas most
DHCPv6 option spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths. A
zero-byte length produces options similar to the DHCPv6
Vendor-specific Information Option - but not their
contents!</p>

<p>The hash size defaults depend upon the code width
selected, and may be 254 or 1009. Valid values range between
1 and 65535. Note that the higher you configure this value,
the more memory will be used. It is considered good practice
to configure a value that is slightly larger than the
estimated number of options you plan to configure within the
space. Previous versions of ISC DHCP (up to and including
DHCP 3.0.*), this value was fixed at 9973.</p>

<p>The name can then be used in option definitions, as
described earlier in this document. For example:</p>

<p>option space SUNW code width 1 length width 1 hash size
3; option SUNW.server-address code 2 = ip-address; option
SUNW.server-name code 3 = text; option SUNW.root-path code 4
= text;</p>

<p>option space ISC code width 1 length width 1 hash size
3; option ISC.sample code 1 = text; option vendor.ISC code
2495 = encapsulate vivso-sample; option vendor-class.ISC
code 2495 = text;</p>

<p>option ISC.sample &quot;configuration text here&quot;;
option vendor-class.ISC &quot;vendor class here&quot;;</p>

<p>option space docsis code width 2 length width 2 hash
size 17; option docsis.tftp-servers code 32 = array of
ip6-address; option docsis.cablelabs-configuration-file code
33 = text; option docsis.cablelabs-syslog-servers code 34 =
array of ip6-address; option docsis.device-id code 36 =
string; option docsis.time-servers code 37 = array of
ip6-address; option docsis.time-offset code 38 = signed
integer 32; option vsio.docsis code 4491 = encapsulate
docsis;</p>

<p>Once you have defined an option space and the format of
some options, you can set up scopes that define values for
those options, and you can say when to use them. For
example, suppose you want to handle two different classes of
clients. Using the option space definition shown in the
previous example, you can send different option values to
dif- ferent clients based on the vendor-class-identifier
option that the clients send, as follows:</p>

<p>class &quot;vendor-classes&quot; { match option
vendor-class-identifier; }</p>

<p>subclass &quot;vendor-classes&quot;
&quot;SUNW.Ultra-5_10&quot; { vendor-option-space SUNW;
option SUNW.root-path &quot;/export/root/sparc&quot;; }</p>

<p>subclass &quot;vendor-classes&quot;
&quot;SUNW.i86pc&quot; { vendor-option-space SUNW; option
SUNW.root-path &quot;/export/root/i86pc&quot;; }</p>

<p>option SUNW.server-address 172.17.65.1; option
SUNW.server-name &quot;sundhcp-server17-1&quot;;</p>

<p>option vivso-sample.sample &quot;Hello world!&quot;;</p>

<p>option docsis.tftp-servers ::1;</p>

<p>As you can see in the preceding example, regular scoping
rules apply, so you can define values that are global in the
global scope, and only define values that are specific to a
particular class in the local scope. The vendor-option-space
declaration tells the DHCP server to use options in the SUNW
option space to construct the DHCPv4 vendor-
encapsulated-options option. This is a limitation of that
option - the DHCPv4 VIVSO and the DHCPv6 VSIO options can
have multiple vendor defi- nitions all at once (even
transmitted to the same client), so it is not necessary to
configure this.</p>
