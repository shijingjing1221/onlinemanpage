<p>NAME glutMainLoopEvent - Dispatches all pending
events.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - mainloop</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutMainLoopEvent(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The general outline of this function is to
first drain the queue of win- dowsystem events, in most
cases dispatching each as it is found. After the queue is
empty, we check for timer-based events, coalesced window
events (e.g., redisplays), and windows that need to be
closed.</p>

<p>The cross-reference section for this functions
documentation should ide- ally contain every callback, but
the list would be tediously long and prone to omissions.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Does not necessarily dispatch events that are
received after this function starts processing.</p>

<p>At first glance, this function may not seem to afford
any new capability that you couldn t get with an idle
callback or glutLeaveMainLoop(). How- ever there are other
GLUT-like libraries that may have their own window event
processing loops. Having glutMainLoopEvent() allows you to
ask OpenGLUT to do its work in a batch, then return to
whatever processing the other library (or libraries)
require.</p>
