<p>STRCASECMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
STRCASECMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strcasecmp, strncasecmp - case-insensitive string
comparisons</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;strings.h&gt;</p>

<p>int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2); int
strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strcasecmp() function shall compare,
while ignoring differences in case, the string pointed to by
s1 to the string pointed to by s2. The strncasecmp()
function shall compare, while ignoring differences in case,
not more than n bytes from the string pointed to by s1 to
the string pointed to by s2.</p>

<p>In the POSIX locale, strcasecmp() and strncasecmp()
shall behave as if the strings had been converted to
lowercase and then a byte comparison performed. The results
are unspecified in other locales.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon completion, strcasecmp() shall return
an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the
string pointed to by s1 is, ignoring case, greater than,
equal to, or less than the string pointed to by s2,
respectively.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, strncasecmp() shall return
an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the
possibly null-terminated array pointed to by s1 is, ignoring
case, greater than, equal to, or less than the possibly
null-terminated array pointed to by s2, respec- tively.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
