<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_getnext_event,
posix_trace_timedgetnext_event, posix_trace_trygetnext_event
- retrieve a trace event (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_getnext_event(trace_id_t trid, struct
posix_trace_event_info *restrict event, void *restrict data,
size_t num_bytes, size_t *restrict data_len, int *restrict
unavailable);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_timedgetnext_event(trace_id_t trid,
struct posix_trace_event_info *restrict event, void
*restrict data, size_t num_bytes, size_t *restrict data_len,
int *restrict unavailable, const struct timespec *restrict
abs_timeout);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_trygetnext_event(trace_id_t trid, struct
posix_trace_event_info *restrict event, void *restrict data,
size_t num_bytes, size_t *restrict data_len, int *restrict
unavailable);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_getnext_event() function
shall report a recorded trace event either from an active
trace stream without log or a pre-recorded trace stream
identified by the trid argument. The posix_trace_tryget-
next_event() function shall report a recorded trace event
from an active trace stream without log identified by the
trid argument.</p>

<p>The trace event information associated with the recorded
trace event shall be copied by the function into the
structure pointed to by the argument event and the data
associated with the trace event shall be copied into the
buffer pointed to by the data argument.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_getnext_event() function shall block if
the trid argu- ment identifies an active trace stream and
there is currently no trace event ready to be retrieved.
When returning, if a recorded trace event was reported, the
variable pointed to by the unavailable argument shall be set
to zero. Otherwise, the variable pointed to by the
unavailable argument shall be set to a value different from
zero.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_timedgetnext_event() function shall
attempt to get another trace event from an active trace
stream without log, as in the posix_trace_getnext_event()
function. However, if no trace event is available from the
trace stream, the implied wait shall be terminated when the
timeout specified by the argument abs_timeout expires, and
the function shall return the error [ETIMEDOUT].</p>

<p>The timeout shall expire when the absolute time
specified by abs_time- out passes, as measured by the clock
upon which timeouts are based (that is, when the value of
that clock equals or exceeds abs_timeout), or if the
absolute time specified by abs_timeout has already passed at
the time of the call.</p>

<p>If the Timers option is supported, the timeout shall be
based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock; if the Timers option is
not supported, the time- out shall be based on the system
clock as returned by the time() func- tion. The resolution
of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock on which
it is based. The timespec data type is defined in the
&lt;time.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a
timeout if a trace event is immediately available from the
trace stream. The validity of the abs_timeout argument need
not be checked if a trace event is imme- diately available
from the trace stream.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function for a pre-recorded trace
stream is unspecified.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_trygetnext_event() function shall not
block. This function shall return an error if the trid
argument identifies a pre- recorded trace stream. If a
recorded trace event was reported, the variable pointed to
by the unavailable argument shall be set to zero. Otherwise,
if no trace event was reported, the variable pointed to by
the unavailable argument shall be set to a value different
from zero.</p>

<p>The argument num_bytes shall be the size of the buffer
pointed to by the data argument. The argument data_len
reports to the application the length in bytes of the data
record just transferred. If num_bytes is greater than or
equal to the size of the data associated with the trace
event pointed to by the event argument, all the recorded
data shall be transferred. In this case, the
truncation-status member of the trace event structure shall
be either POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED, if the trace event data
was recorded without truncation while tracing, or
POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD, if the trace event data was
truncated when it was recorded. If the num_bytes argument is
less than the length of recorded trace event data, the data
transferred shall be truncated to a length of num_bytes, the
value stored in the variable pointed to by data_len shall be
equal to num_bytes, and the truncation-status mem- ber of
the event structure argument shall be set to
POSIX_TRACE_TRUN- CATED_READ (see the posix_trace_event_info
structure defined in &lt;trace.h&gt;).</p>

<p>The report of a trace event shall be sequential starting
from the old- est recorded trace event. Trace events shall
be reported in the order in which they were generated, up to
an implementation-defined time res- olution that causes the
ordering of trace events occurring very close to each other
to be unknown. Once reported, a trace event cannot be
reported again from an active trace stream. Once a trace
event is reported from an active trace stream without log,
the trace stream shall make the resources associated with
that trace event available to record future generated trace
events.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>If successful, these functions store:</p>

<p>* The recorded trace event in the object pointed to by
event</p>

<p>* The trace event information associated with the
recorded trace event in the object pointed to by data</p>

<p>* The length of this trace event information in the
object pointed to by data_len</p>

<p>* The value of zero in the object pointed to by
unavailable</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The trace stream identifier argument trid is
invalid.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_getnext_event() and
posix_trace_timedgetnext_event() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINTR The operation was interrupted by a signal, and so
the call had no effect.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_trygetnext_event() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The trace stream identifier argument trid does
not correspond to an active trace stream.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_timedgetnext_event() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL There is no trace event immediately available
from the trace stream, and the timeout argument is
invalid.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT No trace event was available from the trace
stream before the specified timeout timeout expired.</p>
