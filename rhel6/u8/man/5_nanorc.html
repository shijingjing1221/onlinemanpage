<p>NAME nanorc - GNU nanos rcfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page briefly documents GNU nanos
rcfile.</p>

<p>nano is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to
replace Pico, the default editor included in the non-free
Pine package. Rather than just copying Picos look and feel,
nano also implements some missing (or disabled by default)
features in Pico, such as &quot;search and replace&quot; and
&quot;go to line and column number&quot;.</p>

<p>The nanorc file contains the default settings for nano.
It should not be in DOS or Mac format. During startup, nano
will first read its sys- tem-wide settings from
SYSCONFDIR/nanorc, and then user-specific set- tings from
~/.nanorc.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The configuration file accepts a series of set
and unset commands, which can be used to configure nano on
startup without using the com- mand line options.
Additionally, the syntax, color, and icolor key- words are
used to define syntax highlighting rules for different text
patterns. nano will read one command per line.</p>

<p>Options in nanorc files take precedence over nano s
defaults, and com- mand line options override nanorc
settings. Also, options are unset by default, except for
those that take arguments.</p>

<p>Quotes inside string parameters dont have to be escaped
with back- slashes. The last double quote in the string will
be treated as its end. For example, for the brackets option,
&quot;&quot;)&gt;]}&quot; will match &quot;, , ), &gt;, ],
and }.</p>

<p>The supported commands and arguments are:</p>

<p>set/unset autoindent Use auto-indentation.</p>

<p>set/unset backup Create backup files in filename~.</p>

<p>set backupdir directory Set the directory where nano
puts unique backup files if file back- ups are enabled.</p>

<p>set/unset backwards Do backwards searches by
default.</p>

<p>set/unset boldtext Use bold text instead of reverse
video text.</p>

<p>set brackets string Set the characters treated as
closing brackets when justifying para- graphs. They cannot
contain blank characters. Only closing punctu- ation,
optionally followed by closing brackets, can end sentences.
The default value is &quot;&quot;)&gt;]}&quot;.</p>

<p>set/unset casesensitive Do case sensitive searches by
default.</p>

<p>set/unset const Constantly display the cursor position
in the status bar.</p>

<p>set/unset cut Use cut to end of line by default.</p>

<p>set fill n Wrap lines at column number n. If n is 0 or
less, the maximum line length will be the screen width less
n columns. The default value is -8.</p>

<p>set/unset historylog Enable ~/.nano_history for saving
and reading search/replace strings.</p>

<p>set matchbrackets string Set the opening and closing
brackets that can be found by bracket searches. They cannot
contain blank characters. The former set must come before
the latter set, and both must be in the same order. The
default value is &quot;(&lt;[{)&gt;]}&quot;.</p>

<p>set/unset morespace Use the blank line below the
titlebar as extra editing space.</p>

<p>set/unset mouse Enable mouse support, if available for
your system. When enabled, mouse clicks can be used to place
the cursor, set the mark (with a double click), and execute
shortcuts. The mouse will work in the X Window System, and
on the console when gpm is running.</p>

<p>set/unset multibuffer Allow inserting files into their
own buffers.</p>

<p>set/unset noconvert Dont convert files from DOS/Mac
format.</p>

<p>set/unset nofollow Dont follow symlinks when writing
files.</p>

<p>set/unset nohelp Dont display the help lists at the
bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>set/unset nonewlines Dont add newlines to the ends of
files.</p>

<p>set/unset nowrap Dont wrap text at all.</p>

<p>set operatingdir directory nano will only read and write
files inside directory and its subdi- rectories. Also, the
current directory is changed to here, so files are inserted
from this diractory. By default, the operating direc- tory
feature is turned off.</p>

<p>set/unset preserve Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q
and ^S).</p>

<p>set punct string Set the characters treated as closing
punctuation when justifying paragraphs. They cannot contain
blank characters. Only closing punctuation, optionally
followed by closing brackets, can end sen- tences. The
default value is &quot;!.?&quot;.</p>

<p>set/unset quickblank Do quick statusbar blanking.
Statusbar messages will disappear after 1 keystroke instead
of 25.</p>

<p>set quotestr string The email-quote string, used to
justify email-quoted paragraphs. This is an extended regular
expression if your system supports them, otherwise a literal
string. The default value is &quot;^([ t]*[#:&gt;|}])+&quot;
if you have extended regular expression sup- port, or
&quot;&gt; &quot; otherwise. Note that stands for a literal
Tab character.</p>

<p>set/unset rebinddelete Interpret the Delete key
differently so that both Backspace and Delete work properly.
You should only need to use this option if Backspace acts
like Delete on your system.</p>

<p>set/unset rebindkeypad Interpret the numeric keypad keys
so that they all work properly. You should only need to use
this option if they don t, as mouse sup- port wont work
properly with this option enabled.</p>

<p>set/unset regexp Do extended regular expression searches
by default.</p>

<p>set/unset smarthome Make the Home key smarter. When Home
is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of
non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to
that beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the cursor
is already at that position, it will jump to the true begin-
ning of the line.</p>

<p>set/unset smooth Use smooth scrolling by default.</p>

<p>set speller spellprog Use spelling checker spellprog
instead of the built-in one, which calls spell.</p>

<p>set/unset suspend Allow nano to be suspended.</p>

<p>set tabsize n Use a tab size of n columns. The value of
n must be greater than 0. The default value is 8.</p>

<p>set/unset tabstospaces Convert typed tabs to spaces.</p>

<p>set/unset tempfile Save automatically on exit, dont
prompt.</p>

<p>set/unset view Disallow file modification.</p>

<p>set whitespace string Set the two characters used to
display the first characters of tabs and spaces. They must
be single-column characters.</p>

<p>set/unset wordbounds Detect word boundaries more
accurately by treating punctuation char- acters as parts of
words.</p>

<p>syntax str [&quot;fileregex&quot; ... ] Defines a syntax
named str which can be activated via the -Y/--syn- tax
command line option, or will be automatically activated if
the current filename matches the extended regular expression
fileregex. All following color and icolor statements will
apply to syntax until a new syntax is defined.</p>

<p>The none syntax is reserved; specifying it on the
command line is the same as not having a syntax at all. The
default syntax is spe- cial: it takes no fileregex, and
applies to files that dont match any other syntaxs
fileregex.</p>

<p>color fgcolor,bgcolor regex ... For the currently
defined syntax, display all expressions matching the
extended regular expression regex with foreground color
fgcolor and background color bgcolor, at least one of which
must be speci- fied. Legal colors for foreground and
background color are: white, black, red, blue, green,
yellow, magenta, and cyan. You may use the prefix
&quot;bright&quot; to force a stronger color highlight for
the fore- ground. If your terminal supports transparency,
not specifying a bgcolor tells nano to attempt to use a
transparent background.</p>

<p>icolor fgcolor,bgcolor regex ... Same as above, except
that the expression matching is case insensi- tive.</p>

<p>color fgcolor,bgcolor start=&quot;sr&quot;
end=&quot;er&quot; Display expressions which start with the
extended regular expression sr and end with the extended
regular expression er with foreground color fgcolor and
background color bgcolor, at least one of which must be
specified. This allows syntax highlighting to span multiple
lines. Note that all subsequent instances of sr after an
initial sr is found will be highlighted until the first
instance of er.</p>

<p>icolor fgcolor,bgcolor start=&quot;sr&quot;
end=&quot;er&quot; Same as above, except that the expression
matching is case insensi- tive.</p>

<p>include syntaxfile Read in self-contained color syntaxes
from syntaxfile. Note that syntaxfile can only contain
syntax, color, and icolor commands.</p>
