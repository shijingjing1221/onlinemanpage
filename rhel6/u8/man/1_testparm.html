<p>NAME testparm - check an smb.conf configuration file for
internal correctness</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS testparm [-s] [-h] [-v] [-t &lt;encoding&gt;]
{config filename} [hostname hostIP]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>testparm is a very simple test program to check an
smbd(8) configuration file for internal correctness. If this
program reports no problems, you can use the configuration
file with confidence that smbd will successfully load the
configuration file.</p>

<p>Note that this is NOT a guarantee that the services
specified in the configuration file will be available or
will operate as expected.</p>

<p>If the optional host name and host IP address are
specified on the command line, this test program will run
through the service entries reporting whether the specified
host has access to each service.</p>

<p>If testparm finds an error in the smb.conf file it
returns an exit code of 1 to the calling program, else it
returns an exit code of 0. This allows shell scripts to test
the output from testparm.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s Without this option, testparm will prompt for
a carriage return after printing the service names and
before dumping the service definitions.</p>

<p>-?|--help Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>-V|--version Prints the program version number.</p>

<p>-v If this option is specified, testparm will also
output all options that were not used in smb.conf(5) and are
thus set to their defaults.</p>

<p>-t encoding Output data in specified encoding.</p>

<p>--parameter-name parametername Dumps the named
parameter. If no section-name is set the view is limited by
default to the global section. It is also possible to dump a
parametrical option. Therefore the option has to be
separated by a colon from the parametername.</p>

<p>--section-name sectionname Dumps the named section.</p>

<p>configfilename This is the name of the configuration
file to check. If this parameter is not present then the
default smb.conf(5) file will be checked.</p>

<p>hostname If this parameter and the following are
specified, then testparm will examine the hosts allow and
hosts deny parameters in the smb.conf(5) file to determine
if the hostname with this IP address would be allowed access
to the smbd server. If this parameter is supplied, the
hostIP parameter must also be supplied.</p>

<p>hostIP This is the IP address of the host specified in
the previous parameter. This address must be supplied if the
hostname parameter is supplied.</p>

<p>FILES smb.conf(5) This is usually the name of the
configuration file used by smbd(8).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The program will issue a message saying
whether the configuration file loaded OK or not. This
message may be preceded by errors and warnings if the file
did not load. If the file was loaded OK, the program then
dumps all known service details to stdout.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
