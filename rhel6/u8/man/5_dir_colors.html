<p>DIR_COLORS(5) Linux User Manual DIR_COLORS(5)</p>

<p>NAME dir_colors - configuration file for
dircolors(1)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The program ls(1) uses the environment
variable LS_COLORS to determine the colors in which the
filenames are to be displayed. This environ- ment variable
is usually set by a command like</p>

<p>eval &lsquo;dircolors some_path/dir_colors&lsquo;</p>

<p>found in a system default shell initialization file,
like /etc/profile or /etc/csh.cshrc. (See also
dircolors(1).) Usually, the file used here is
/etc/DIR_COLORS and can be overridden by a .dir_colors file
in ones home directory.</p>

<p>This configuration file consists of several statements,
one per line. Anything right of a hash mark (#) is treated
as a comment, if the hash mark is at the beginning of a line
or is preceded by at least one whitespace. Blank lines are
ignored.</p>

<p>The global section of the file consists of any statement
before the first TERM statement. Any statement in the global
section of the file is considered valid for all terminal
types. Following the global sec- tion is one or more
terminal-specific sections, preceded by one or more TERM
statements which specify the terminal types (as given by the
TERM environment variable) the following declarations apply
to. It is always possible to override a global declaration
by a subsequent termi- nal-specific one.</p>

<p>The following statements are recognized; case is
insignificant:</p>

<p>TERM terminal-type Starts a terminal-specific section
and specifies which terminal it applies to. Multiple TERM
statements can be used to create a section which applies for
several terminal types.</p>

<p>COLOR yes|all|no|none|tty (Slackware only; ignored by
GNU dircolors(1).) Specifies that colorization should always
be enabled (yes or all), never enabled (no or none), or
enabled only if the output is a termi- nal (tty). The
default is no.</p>

<p>EIGHTBIT yes|no (Slackware only; ignored by GNU
dircolors(1).) Specifies that eight-bit ISO 8859 characters
should be enabled by default. For compatibility reasons,
this can also be specified as 1 for yes or 0 for no. The
default is no.</p>

<p>OPTIONS options (Slackware only; ignored by GNU
dircolors(1).) Adds command- line options to the default ls
command line. The options can be any valid ls command-line
options, and should include the lead- ing minus sign. Note
that dircolors does not verify the valid- ity of these
options.</p>

<p>NORMAL color-sequence Specifies the color used for
normal (non-filename) text.</p>

<p>FILE color-sequence Specifies the color used for a
regular file.</p>

<p>DIR color-sequence Specifies the color used for
directories.</p>

<p>LINK color-sequence Specifies the color used for a
symbolic link.</p>

<p>ORPHAN color-sequence Specifies the color used for an
orphaned symbolic link (one which points to a nonexistent
file). If this is unspecified, ls will use the LINK color
instead.</p>

<p>MISSING color-sequence Specifies the color used for a
missing file (a nonexistent file which nevertheless has a
symbolic link pointing to it). If this is unspecified, ls
will use the FILE color instead.</p>

<p>FIFO color-sequence Specifies the color used for a FIFO
(named pipe).</p>

<p>SOCK color-sequence Specifies the color used for a
socket.</p>

<p>DOOR color-sequence (Supported since fileutils 4.1)
Specifies the color used for a door (Solaris 2.5 and
later).</p>

<p>BLK color-sequence Specifies the color used for a block
device special file.</p>

<p>CHR color-sequence Specifies the color used for a
character device special file.</p>

<p>EXEC color-sequence Specifies the color used for a file
with the executable attribute set.</p>

<p>LEFTCODE color-sequence Specifies the left code for
non-ISO 6429 terminals (see below).</p>

<p>RIGHTCODE color-sequence Specifies the right code for
non-ISO 6429 terminals (see below).</p>

<p>ENDCODE color-sequence Specifies the end code for
non-ISO 6429 terminals (see below).</p>

<p>*extension color-sequence Specifies the color used for
any file that ends in extension.</p>

<p>.extension color-sequence Same as *.extension. Specifies
the color used for any file that ends in .extension. Note
that the period is included in the extension, which makes it
impossible to specify an extension not starting with a
period, such as ~ for emacs backup files. This form should
be considered obsolete.</p>

<p>ISO 6429 (ANSI) Color Sequences Most color-capable ASCII
terminals today use ISO 6429 (ANSI) color sequences, and
many common terminals without color capability, includ- ing
xterm and the widely used and cloned DEC VT100, will
recognize ISO 6429 color codes and harmlessly eliminate them
from the output or emu- late them. ls uses ISO 6429 codes by
default, assuming colorization is enabled.</p>

<p>ISO 6429 color sequences are composed of sequences of
numbers separated by semicolons. The most common codes
are:</p>

<p>0 to restore default color 1 for brighter colors 4 for
underlined text 5 for flashing text 30 for black foreground
31 for red foreground 32 for green foreground 33 for yellow
(or brown) foreground 34 for blue foreground 35 for purple
foreground 36 for cyan foreground 37 for white (or gray)
foreground 40 for black background 41 for red background 42
for green background 43 for yellow (or brown) background 44
for blue background 45 for purple background 46 for cyan
background 47 for white (or gray) background</p>

<p>Not all commands will work on all systems or display
devices.</p>

<p>ls uses the following defaults:</p>

<p>NORMAL 0 Normal (non-filename) text FILE 0 Regular file
DIR 32 Directory LINK 36 Symbolic link ORPHAN undefined
Orphaned symbolic link MISSING undefined Missing file FIFO
31 Named pipe (FIFO) SOCK 33 Socket BLK 44;37 Block device
CHR 44;37 Character device EXEC 35 Executable file</p>

<p>A few terminal programs do not recognize the default
properly. If all text gets colorized after you do a
directory listing, change the NORMAL and FILE codes to the
numerical codes for your normal foreground and background
colors.</p>

<p>Other Terminal Types (Advanced Configuration) If you
have a color-capable (or otherwise highlighting) terminal
(or printer!) which uses a different set of codes, you can
still generate a suitable setup. To do so, you will have to
use the LEFTCODE, RIGHT- CODE, and ENDCODE definitions.</p>

<p>When writing out a filename, ls generates the following
output sequence: LEFTCODE typecode RIGHTCODE filename
ENDCODE, where the type- code is the color sequence that
depends on the type or name of file. If the ENDCODE is
undefined, the sequence LEFTCODE NORMAL RIGHTCODE will be
used instead. The purpose of the left- and rightcodes is
merely to reduce the amount of typing necessary (and to hide
ugly escape codes away from the user). If they are not
appropriate for your terminal, you can eliminate them by
specifying the respective keyword on a line by itself.</p>

<p>NOTE: If the ENDCODE is defined in the global section of
the setup file, it cannot be undefined in a
terminal-specific section of the file. This means any NORMAL
definition will have no effect. A differ- ent ENDCODE can,
however, be specified, which would have the same effect.</p>

<p>Escape Sequences To specify control- or blank characters
in the color sequences or file- name extensions, either
C-style &minus;escaped notation or stty-style ^-notation can
be used. The C-style notation includes the following
characters:</p>

<p>a Bell (ASCII 7) b B a c k s p a c e ( A S C I I 8 ) e
Escape (ASCII 27) f Form feed (ASCII 12) n Newline (ASCII
10)r Carriage Return (ASCII 13) t Tab (ASCII 9) Vertical Tab
(ASCII 11) nnn Any character (octal notation) nnn Any
character (hexadecimal notation) _ Space \ Backslash ( ^
Caret (^) Please note that escapes are necessary to enter a
space, backslash, caret, or any control character anywhere
in the string, as well as a hash mark as the first
character.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/DIR_COLORS System-wide configuration
file.</p>

<p>~/.dir_colors Per-user configuration file.</p>

<p>This page describes the dir_colors file format as used
in the fileu- tils-4.1 package; other versions may differ
slightly.</p>

<p>NOTES The default LEFTCODE and RIGHTCODE definitions,
which are used by ISO 6429 terminals are:</p>

<p>LEFTCODE \[ RIGHTCODE m</p>

<p>The default ENDCODE is undefined.</p>
