<p>PAM_SET_ITEM(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_SET_ITEM(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_set_item - set and update PAM informations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_set_item(pam_handle_t *pamh, int item_type,
const void *item);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_set_item function allows
applications and PAM service modules to access and to update
PAM informations of item_type. For this a copy of the object
pointed to by the item argument is created. The following
item_types are supported:</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE The service name (which identifies that PAM
stack that the PAM functions will use to authenticate the
program).</p>

<p>PAM_USER The username of the entity under whose identity
service will be given. That is, following authentication,
PAM_USER identifies the local entity that gets to use the
service. Note, this value can be mapped from something (eg.,
&quot;anonymous&quot;) to something else (eg.
&quot;guest119&quot;) by any module in the PAM stack. As
such an application should consult the value of PAM_USER
after each call to a PAM function.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_PROMPT The string used when prompting for a
user&acute;s name. The default value for this string is a
localized version of &quot;login: &quot;.</p>

<p>PAM_TTY The terminal name: prefixed by /dev/ if it is a
device file; for graphical, X-based, applications the value
for this item should be the $DISPLAY variable.</p>

<p>PAM_RUSER The requesting user name: local name for a
locally requesting user or a remote user name for a remote
requesting user.</p>

<p>Generally an application or module will attempt to
supply the value that is most strongly authenticated (a
local account before a remote one. The level of trust in
this value is embodied in the actual authentication stack
associated with the application, so it is ultimately at the
discretion of the system administrator.</p>

<p>PAM_RUSER@PAM_RHOST should always identify the
requesting user. In some cases, PAM_RUSER may be NULL. In
such situations, it is unclear who the requesting entity
is.</p>

<p>PAM_RHOST The requesting hostname (the hostname of the
machine from which the PAM_RUSER entity is requesting
service). That is PAM_RUSER@PAM_RHOST does identify the
requesting user. In some applications, PAM_RHOST may be
NULL. In such situations, it is unclear where the
authentication request is originating from.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK The authentication token (often a password).
This token should be ignored by all module functions besides
pam_sm_authenticate(3) and pam_sm_chauthtok(3). In the
former function it is used to pass the most recent
authentication token from one stacked module to another. In
the latter function the token is used for another purpose.
It contains the currently active authentication token.</p>

<p>PAM_OLDAUTHTOK The old authentication token. This token
should be ignored by all module functions except
pam_sm_chauthtok(3).</p>

<p>PAM_CONV The pam_conv structure. See pam_conv(3).</p>

<p>The following additional items are specific to Linux-PAM
and should not be used in portable applications:</p>

<p>PAM_FAIL_DELAY A function pointer to redirect centrally
managed failure delays. See pam_fail_delay(3).</p>

<p>PAM_XDISPLAY The name of the X display. For graphical,
X-based applications the value for this item should be the
$DISPLAY variable. This value may be used independently of
PAM_TTY for passing the name of the display.</p>

<p>PAM_XAUTHDATA A pointer to a structure containing the X
authentication data required to make a connection to the
display specified by PAM_XDISPLAY, if such information is
necessary. See pam_xauth_data(3).</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_TYPE The default action is for the module to
use the following prompts when requesting passwords:
&quot;New UNIX password: &quot; and &quot;Retype UNIX
password: &quot;. The example word UNIX can be replaced with
this item, by default it is empty. This item is used by
pam_get_authtok(3).</p>

<p>For all item_types, other than PAM_CONV and
PAM_FAIL_DELAY, item is a pointer to a &lt;NUL&gt;
terminated character string. In the case of PAM_CONV, item
points to an initialized pam_conv structure. In the case of
PAM_FAIL_DELAY, item is a function pointer: void
(*delay_fn)(int retval, unsigned usec_delay, void
*appdata_ptr)</p>

<p>Both, PAM_AUTHTOK and PAM_OLDAUTHTOK, will be reseted
before returning to the application. Which means an
application is not able to access the authentication
tokens.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_BAD_ITEM The application attempted to
set an undefined or inaccessible item.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Data was successful updated.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR The pam_handle_t passed as first argument
was invalid.</p>
