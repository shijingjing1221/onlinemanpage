<p>sane-dc240(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-dc240(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-dc240 - SANE backend for Kodak DC240 Digital
Camera</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-dc240 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the Kodak DC240 camera. THIS IS EXTREMELY ALPHA CODE! USE AT
YOUR OWN RISK!!</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES The current version of the backend only
allows one camera to be con- nected. The device name is
always &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the dc240.conf specify the
serial port and baud rate to use. The baud rate specifies
the maximum rate to use while downloading pictures. (The
camera is always initialized using 9600 baud, then switches
to the higher rate). On a 450MHz Pentium, I usually have no
problems downloading at 115200 baud, though the camera
sometimes has to resend packets due to lost characters.
Results are better when the &quot;interrupt-unmask
flag&quot; is set in the IDE driver (hdparm -u1). Sup-
ported baud rates are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and
115200.</p>

<p>The dumpinquiry line causes some information about the
camera to be printed.</p>

<p>cmdrespause specifies how many usec (1,000,000ths of a)
between writing the command and reading the result should be
used. 125000 seems to be the lowest I could go reliably.</p>

<p>breakpause is the time in 1,000,000ths of a usec between
sending the &quot;back to default&quot; break sending
commands.</p>

<p>Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>port=/dev/ttyS0 # this is a comment baud=115200
dumpinquiry cmdrespause=125000 breakpause=1000000</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/dc240.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-dc240.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-dc240.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the
configuration file is searched in two default directories:
first, the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and
then in /etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment
variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly
specified directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR
to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_DC240 If the library was compiled with
debugging support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. A value of 128
requests maximally copious debug output; smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>AUTHOR Peter S. Fales</p>

<p>This backend borrows heavily from the dc210 backend by
Brian J. Murrell which is based somewhat on the dc25 backend
by Peter Fales.</p>

<p>The manpage was largely copied from the dc210
manpage.</p>

<p>BUGS The major limitation that I know of is that the
backend assumes the directory in the camera is 100dc240.
Once the camera has taken more than 9999 pictures, the
directory will increment to 101dc240. Not only should we
check for the additional directory, but pictures may
actually be found in multiple directories.</p>

<p>More general comments, suggestions, and inquiries about
frontends or SANE should go to the SANE Developers mailing
list (see http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html for
details). You must be subscribed to the list, otherwise your
mail wont be sent to the subscribers.</p>
