<p>DESCRIPTION The fcoeadm utility is the Fibre Channel
over Ethernet (FCoE) management tool for the Open-FCoE
project. fcoeadm may be used to create, destroy, and reset
an FCoE instance on a given network interface. For these
operations fcoeadm sends a command to a running fcoemon
process, via a socket interface. fcoemon will then perform
the requested operation.</p>

<p>fcoeadm also provides operations to query information
about FCoE instances, including interface information,
target information, LUN information, and port statistics.
For much of this information, fcoeadm relies on the
libhbalinux implementation of the HBA API. Only one
operation may be given on a command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -m, --mode fabric|vn2vn Used together with the
create option to control the FCoE mode of operation. The
mode defaults to fabric but this option allows the selection
of vn2vn mode.</p>

<p>OPERATIONS -c, --create ethX Creates an FCoE instance
based on the specified network interface. Note that if there
is not an fcoemon configuration file for the interface
(/etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX, see fcoemon), then the created FCoE
instance will not require DCB.</p>

<p>-d, --destroy ethX Destroys the FCoE instance on the
specified network interface. This will not destroy FCoE
instances created by fipvlan.</p>

<p>-r, --reset ethX Resets the FCoE instance on the
specified network interface. This will not reset FCoE
instances created by fipvlan.</p>

<p>-S, --Scan ethX Rescan for new targets and LUNs on the
provided instance. This command will not rescan any NPIV
instances created on the same port. This will not rescan any
FCoE instance created by fipvlan.</p>

<p>-i, --interface [ethX] Show information about the FCoE
instance on the specified network interface, or all FCoE
instances if no network interface is specified.</p>

<p>-f, --fcf [ethX] Show information about the discovered
Fibre Channel Forwarders (FCFs) on the specified network
interface, or all discovered FCFs if no network interface is
specified.</p>

<p>-t, --target [ethX] Show information about the
discovered targets associated with the FCoE instance on the
specified network interface. If no network interface is
specified, information about discovered targets from all
FCoE instances will be shown.</p>

<p>-l, --lun [ethX] Show detailed information about the
discovered SCSI LUNs associated with the FCoE instance on
the specified network interface. If no network interface is
specified, information about SCSI LUNs from all FCoE
instances will be shown.</p>

<p>-s, --stats ethX [interval] Show the statistics
(including FC4 statistics) of the FCoE connection on the
specified network interface. The information will be
displayed repeatedly until the user cancels the command. The
statistics will be printed every specified interval (in
seconds). interval should be specified as a whole number
greater than 0. If interval is not specified, a default
interval of one second is used.</p>

<p>-b, --lesb ethX [interval] Show the Link Error
Statistics Block (LESB) of the FCoE connection on the
specified network interface. The information will be
displayed repeatedly until the user cancels the command. The
LESB statistics will be printed every specified interval (in
seconds). interval should be specified in whole integers
greater than 0. If the interval is not specified, a default
interval of one second is used.</p>

<p>-h, --help Displays the usage message of the fcoeadm
command.</p>

<p>-v, --version Displays the version of the fcoeadm
command.</p>

<p>INTERFACE NAMES The actual name for ethX depends on the
AUTO_VLAN setting in the fcoemon interface configuration
(/etc/fcoe/cfg-ethX, see fcoemon).</p>

<p>If AUTO_VLAN is set to yes, the interface name ethX
references the network device itself. If AUTO_VLAN is set to
no, the interface name ethX references the VLAN device.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creates an FCoE instance on eth2.101</p>

<p>fcoeadm -c eth2.101</p>

<p>Creates an FCoE VN2VN instance on eth2.101</p>

<p>fcoeadm -m vn2vn -c eth2.101</p>

<p>Destroys the FCoE instance on eth2.101</p>

<p>fcoeadm -d eth2.101</p>

<p>Resets the FCoE instance on eth2.101</p>

<p>fcoeadm -r eth2.101</p>

<p>Show the information of all the adapters and their ports
having FCoE instances created</p>

<p>fcoeadm -i</p>

<p>Show the information of all FCoE instances on interface
eth3.</p>

<p>fcoeadm -i eth3</p>

<p>Show the information of all the discovered targets from
all the ports having FCoE instances created (they may be on
different adapter cards). A brief listing of discovered LUNs
are listed after the target they are associated with, if
any</p>

<p>fcoeadm -t</p>

<p>Show the information of all the discovered targets from
a given port (eth3) having FCoE instance created. A brief
listing of discovered LUNs are listed after each target they
are associated with, if any</p>

<p>fcoeadm -t eth3</p>

<p>Show the detailed information of all the LUNs discovered
on all FCoE connections</p>

<p>fcoeadm -l</p>

<p>Show the detailed information of all the LUNs associated
with a specific interface</p>

<p>fcoeadm -l eth3.101</p>

<p>Show the statistics information of a specific port eth3
having FCoE instances created. The statistics are displayed
one line per time interval. The default interval is one
second if an interval is not specified</p>

<p>fcoeadm -s eth3</p>

<p>fcoeadm -s eth3 3</p>
