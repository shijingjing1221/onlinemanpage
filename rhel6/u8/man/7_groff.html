<p>NAME groff - a short reference for the GNU roff
language</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The name groff stands for GNU roff and is
the free implementation of the roff type-setting system. See
roff(7) for a survey and the back- ground of the groff
system.</p>

<p>This document gives only short descriptions of the
predefined roff lan- guage elements as used in groff. Both
the classical features and the groff extensions are
provided.</p>

<p>Historically, the roff language was called troff. groff
is compatible with the classical system and provides proper
extensions. So in GNU, the terms roff, troff, and groff
language could be used as synonyms. However troff slightly
tends to refer more to the classical aspects, whereas groff
emphasizes the GNU extensions, and roff is the general term
for the language.</p>

<p>This file is only a short version of the complete
documentation that is found in the groff info(1) file, which
contains more detailed, actual, and concise information.</p>

<p>The general syntax for writing groff documents is
relatively easy, but writing extensions to the roff language
can be a bit harder.</p>

<p>The roff language is line-oriented. There are only two
kinds of lines, control lines and text lines. The control
lines start with a control character, by default a period .
or a single quote; all other lines are text lines.</p>

<p>Control lines represent commands, optionally with
arguments. They have the following syntax. The leading
control character can be followed by a command name;
arguments, if any, are separated by blanks from the command
name and among themselves, for example,</p>

<p>.command_name arg1 arg2</p>

<p>For indentation, any number of space or tab characters
can be inserted between the leading control character and
the command name, but the control character must be on the
first position of the line.</p>

<p>Text lines represent the parts that will be printed.
They can be modi- fied by escape sequences, which are
recognized by a leading backslash . These are in-line or
even in-word formatting elements or func- tions. Some of
these take arguments separated by single quotes , others are
regulated by a length encoding introduced by an open paren-
thesis ( or enclosed in brackets [ and ].</p>

<p>The roff language provides flexible instruments for
writing language extension, such as macros. When
interpreting macro definitions, the roff system enters a
special operating mode, called the copy mode.</p>

<p>The copy mode behavior can be quite tricky, but there
are some rules that ensure a safe usage.</p>

<p>1. Printable backslashes must be denoted ase. To be more
pre- cise,e represents the current escape character. To get
a backslash glyph, use(rs or[rs].</p>

<p>2. Double all backslashes.</p>

<p>3. Begin all text lines with the special non-spacing
characte&amp;.</p>

<p>This does not produce the most efficient code, but it
should work as a first measure. For better strategies, see
the groff info file and groff_tmac(5).</p>

<p>Reading roff source files is easier, just reduce all
double backslashes to a single one in all macro
definitions.</p>

<p>GROFF ELEMENTS The roff language elements add formatting
information to a text file. The fundamental elements are
predefined commands and variables that make roff a
full-blown programming language.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of roff commands, possibly with
arguments. Requests are written on a line of their own
starting with a dot . or a , whereas Escape sequences are
in-line functions and in-word for- matting elements starting
with a backslash.</p>

<p>The user can define her own formatting commands using
the de request. These commands are called macros, but they
are used exactly like requests. Macro packages are
pre-defined sets of macros written in the groff language. A
users possibilities to create escape sequences her- self is
very limited, only special characters can be mapped.</p>

<p>The groff language provides several kinds of variables
with different interfaces. There are pre-defined variables,
but the user can define her own variables as well.</p>

<p>String variables store character sequences. They are set
with the ds request and retrieved by the * escape sequences.
Strings can have variables.</p>

<p>Register variables can store numerical values, numbers
with a scale unit, and occasionally string-like objects.
They are set with the nr request and retrieved by then
escape sequences.</p>

<p>Environments allow the user to temporarily store global
formatting parameters like line length, font size, etc. for
later reuse. This is done by the ev request.</p>

<p>Fonts are identified either by a name or by an internal
number. The current font is chosen by the ft request or by
thef escape sequences. Each device has special fonts, but
the following fonts are available for all devices. R is the
standard font Roman. B is its bold counter- part. The italic
font is called I and is available everywhere, but on text
devices it is displayed as an underlined Roman font. For the
graphical output devices, there exist constant-width
pendants of these fonts, CR, CI, and CB. On text devices,
all characters have a constant width anyway.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are some advanced roff elements. A
diversion stores information into a macro for later usage. A
trap is a positional con- dition like a certain number of
lines from page top or in a diversion or in the input. Some
action can be prescribed to be run automatically when the
condition is met.</p>

<p>More detailed information and examples can be found in
the groff info file.</p>

<p>CONTROL CHARACTERS There is a small set of characters
that have a special controlling task in certain
conditions.</p>

<p>. A dot is only special at the beginning of a line or
after the condition in the requests if, ie, el, and while.
There it is the control character that introduces a request
(or macro). The special behavior can be delayed by using the
. escape. By using the cc request, the control character can
be set to a dif- ferent character, making the dot . a
non-special character.</p>

<p>In all other positions, it just means a dot character.
In text paragraphs, it is advantageous to start each
sentence at a line of its own.</p>

<p>The single quote has two controlling tasks. At the
beginning of a line and in the conditional requests it is
the non-breaking control character. That means that it
introduces a request like the dot, but with the additional
property that this request doesn t cause a linebreak. By
using the c2 request, the non- break control character can
be set to a different character.</p>

<p>As a second task, it is the most commonly used argument
separa- tor in some functional escape sequences (but any
pair of charac- ters not part of the argument will work). In
all other posi- tions, it denotes the single quote or
apostrophe character. Groff provides a printable
representation with the (cq escape sequence.</p>

<p>&quot; The double quote is used to enclose arguments in
requests, macros, and strings. In the ds and as requests, a
leading dou- ble quote in the argument will be stripped off,
making every- thing else afterwards the string to be defined
(enabling leading whitespace). The escaped double quote
Otherwise, it is not special. Groff provides a printable
repre- sentation with the(dq escape sequence.</p>

<p>The backslash usually introduces an escape sequence
(this can be changed with the ec request). A printed version
of the escape character is thee escape; a backslash glyph
can be obtained by (rs.</p>

<p>( The open parenthesis is only special in escape
sequences when introducing an escape name or argument
consisting of exactly two characters. In groff, this
behavior can be replaced by the [] construct.</p>

<p>[ The opening bracket is only special in groff escape
sequences; there it is used to introduce a long escape name
or long escape argument. Otherwise, it is non-special, e.g.
in macro calls.</p>

<p>] The closing bracket is only special in groff escape
sequences; there it terminates a long escape name or long
escape argument. Otherwise, it is non-special.</p>

<p>space Space characters are only functional characters.
They separate the arguments in requests, macros, and
strings, and the words in text lines. They are subject to
groffs horizontal spacing cal- culations. To get a defined
space width, escape sequences like (this is the escape
character followed by a space)|^, or should be used.</p>

<p>newline In text paragraphs, newlines mostly behave like
space charac- ters. Continuation lines can be specified by
an escaped new- line, i.e., by specifying a backslash as the
last character of a line.</p>

<p>tab If a tab character occurs during text the
interpreter makes a horizontal jump to the next pre-defined
tab position. There is a sophisticated interface for
handling tab positions.</p>

<p>NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS A numerical value is a signed or
unsigned integer or float with or without an appended
scaling indicator. A scaling indicator is a one- character
abbreviation for a unit of measurement. A number followed by
a scaling indicator signifies a size value. By default,
numerical val- ues do not have a scaling indicator, i.e.,
they are normal numbers.</p>

<p>The roff language defines the following scaling
indicators.</p>

<p>c Centimeter i Inch P Pica = 1/6 inch p Point = 1/72
inch m Em = the font size in points (width of letter m) M
100th of an Em n En = Em/2 u Basic unit for actual output
device v Vertical line space in basic units scaled point =
1/sizescale of a point (defined in font DESC file) f Scale
by 65536.</p>

<p>Numerical expressions are combinations of the numerical
values defined above with the following arithmetical
operators already defined in classical troff.</p>

<p>+ Addition - Subtraction * Multiplication / Division %
Modulo = Equals == Equals &lt; Less than &gt; Greater than
&lt;= Less or equal &gt;= Greater or equal &amp; Logical and
: Logical or ! Logical not ( Grouping of expressions ) Close
current grouping</p>

<p>Moreover, groff added the following operators for
numerical expres- sions:</p>

<p>e1&gt;?e2 The maximum of e1 and e2. e1&lt;?e2 The
minimum of e1 and e2. (c;e) Evaluate e using c as the
default scaling indicator.</p>

<p>For details see the groff info file.</p>

<p>CONDITIONS Conditions occur in tests raised by the if,
ie, and the while requests. The following table
characterizes the different types of conditions.</p>

<p>N A numerical expression N yields true if its value is
greater than 0. !N True if the value of I is 0. ss2 True if
string s1 is identical to string s2. ! s1s2 True if string
s1 is not identical to string s2. cch True if there is a
character ch available. dname True if there is a string,
macro, diversion, or request called name. e Current page
number is even. o Current page number is odd. mname True if
there is a color called name. n Formatter is nroff. rreg
True if there is a register named reg. t Formatter is
troff.</p>

<p>REQUESTS This section provides a short reference for the
predefined requests. In groff, request and macro names can
be arbitrarily long. No bracket- ing or marking of long
names is needed.</p>

<p>Most requests take one or more arguments. The arguments
are separated by space characters (no tabs!); there is no
inherent limit for their length or number. An argument can
be enclosed by a pair of double quotes. This is very handy
if an argument contains space characters, e.g., &quot;arg
with space&quot; denotes a single argument.</p>

<p>Some requests have optional arguments with a different
behaviour. Not all of these details are outlined here. Refer
to the groff info file and groff_diff(7) for all
details.</p>

<p>In the following request specifications, most argument
names were cho- sen to be descriptive. Only the following
denotations need clarifica- tion.</p>

<p>c denotes a single character. font a font either
specified as a font name or a font num- ber. anything all
characters up to the end of the line or within{ an}. n is a
numerical expression that evaluates to an integer value. N
is an arbitrary numerical expression, signed or unsigned.
&plusmn;N has three meanings depending on its sign,
described below.</p>

<p>If an expression defined as &plusmn;N starts with a +
sign the resulting value of the expression will be added to
an already existing value inherent to the related request,
e.g. adding to a number register. If the expression starts
with a - the value of the expression will be subtracted from
the request value.</p>

<p>Without a sign, N replaces the existing value directly.
To assign a negative number either prepend 0 or enclose the
negative number in parentheses.</p>

<p>Besides these standard groff requests, there might be
further macro calls. They can originate from a macro package
(see roff(7) for an overview) or from a preprocessor.</p>

<p>Preprocessor macros are easy to be recognized. They
enclose their code into a pair of characteristic macros.</p>

<p>ESCAPE SEQUENCES Escape sequences are in-line language
elements usually introduced by a backslash and followed by
an escape name and sometimes by a required argument. Input
processing is continued directly after the escaped character
or the argument resp. without an intervening separa- tion
character. So there must be a way to determine the end of
the escape name and the end of the argument.</p>

<p>This is done by enclosing names (escape name and
arguments consisting of a variable name) by a pair of
brackets [name] and constant arguments (number expressions
and characters) by apostrophes (ASCII 0x27) like
constan.</p>

<p>There are abbreviations for short names. Two character
escape names can be specified by an opening parenthesis
like(xy without a closing counterpart. And all one-character
names different from the special characters [ and ( can even
be specified without a marker in the form Constant arguments
of length 1 can omit the marker apostrophes, too, but there
is no two-character analogue.</p>

<p>While 1-character escape sequences are mainly used for
in-line func- tions and system related tasks, the 2-letter
names following the( construct are used for special
characters predefined by the roff sys- tem. Escapes
sequences with names of more than two characters[name]
denote user defined named characters (see the char
request).</p>

<p>Single Character Escapes ignored. This is interpreted in
copy mode. This is like the terminating newline is ignored
as well. *s The string stored in the string variable with
1-character name s. *(st The string stored in the string
variable with 2-character name st. *[stringvar arg1 arg2
...] The string stored in the string variable with arbitrary
length name stringvar, taking arg1, arg2, ... as arguments.
$0 The name by which the current macro was invoked. The als
request can make a macro have more than one name. $x Macro
or string argument with 1-place number x, where x is a digit
between 1 and 9. $(xy Macro or string argument with 2-digit
number xy. $[nexp] Macro or string argument with number
nexp, where nexp is a numerical expression evaluating to an
integer 1. $* In a macro or string, the concatenation of all
the arguments separated by spaces. $@ In a macro or string,
the concatenation of all the arguments with each surrounded
by double quotes, and separated by spaces. \ reduces to a
single backslash; useful to delay its interpreta- tion as

usee, or even better[rs], to be independent from the current
escape character. The acute accent &acute;; same as (aa.

<p>The escape sequencese,., are interpreted in copy
mode.</p>

<p>Escape sequences starting with ( or [ do not represent
single charac- ter escape sequences, but introduce escape
names with two or more char- acters.</p>

<p>If a backslash is followed by a character that does not
constitute a defined escape sequence the backslash is
silently ignored and the char- acter maps to itself.</p>

<p>Special Characters Common special characters are
predefined by escape sequences of the form (xy with
characters x and y. Some of these exist in the usual font
while most of them are only available in the special font.
Below youll find a selection of the most important glyphs; a
complete list can be found in groff_char(7).</p>

<p>Strings Strings are defined by the ds request and can be
retrieved by the * escape sequence.</p>

<p>Strings share their name space with macros. So strings
and macros without arguments are roughly equivalent; it is
possible to call a string like a macro and vice-versa, but
this often leads to unpre- dictable results. The following
strings are predefined in groff.</p>

<p>.T] The name of the current output device as specified
by the -T command line option.</p>

<p>REGISTERS Registers are variables that store a value. In
groff, most registers store numerical values (see section
NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS above), but some can also hold a
string value.</p>

<p>Each register is given a name. Arbitrary registers can
be defined and set with the request nr register.</p>

<p>The value stored in a register can be retrieved by the
escape sequences introduced byn.</p>

<p>Most useful are predefined registers. In the following
the notation name is used to refer to a register called
register name to make clear that we speak about registers.
Please keep in mind that then[] deco- ration is not part of
the register name.</p>

<p>Read-only Registers The following registers have
predefined values that should not be modi- fied by the user
(usually, registers starting with a dot a read-only).
Mostly, they provide information on the current settings or
store results from request calls.</p>

<p>.$] Number of arguments in the current macro or string.
.a] Post-line extra line-space most recently utilized using
. .A] Set to 1 in troff if option -A is used; always 1 in
nroff. .c] Current input line number. .C] 1 if compatibility
mode is in effect, 0 otherwise. .cdp] The depth of the last
character added to the current environ- ment. It is positive
if the character extends below the baseline. .ce] The number
of lines remaining to be centered, as set by the ce request.
.cht] The height of the last character added to the current
envi- ronment. It is positive if the character extends above
the baseline. .color] 1 if colors are enabled, 0 otherwise.
.csk] The skew of the last character added to the current
environ- ment. The skew of a character is how far to the
right of the center of a character the center of an accent
over that char- acter should be placed. .d] Current vertical
place in current diversion; equal to regis- ter register nl.
.ev] The name or number of the current environment
(string-val- ued). .f] Current font number. .fam] The
current font family (string-valued). .fn] The current
(internal) real font name (string-valued). .fp] The number
of the next free font position. .g] Always 1 in GNU troff.
Macros should use it to test if run- ning under groff. .h]
Text base-line high-water mark on current page or diversion.
.H] Available horizontal resolution in basic units. .hla]
The current hyphenation language as set by the .hla request.
.hlc] The number of immediately preceding consecutive
hyphenated lines. .hlm] The maximum allowed number of
consecutive hyphenated lines, as set by the hlm request.
.hy] The current hyphenation flags (as set by the hy
request). .hym] The current hyphenation margin (as set by
the hym request). .hys] The current hyphenation space (as
set by the hys request). .i] Current ident. .in] The indent
that applies to the current output line. .int] Positive if
last output line contains .kern] 1 if pairwise kerning is
enabled, 0 otherwise. .l] Current line length. .lg] The
current ligature mode (as set by the lg request). .linetabs]
The current line-tabs mode (as set by the linetabs request).
.ll] The line length that applies to the current output
line. .lt] The title length (as set by the lt request). .n]
Length of text portion on previous output line. .ne] The
amount of space that was needed in the last ne request that
caused a trap to be sprung. Useful in conjunction with
register .trunc. .ns] 1 if in no-space mode, 0 otherwise.
.o] Current page offset. .p] Current page length. .pn] The
number of the next page: either the value set by a pn
request, or the number of the current page plus 1. .ps] The
current pointsize in scaled points. .psr] The last-requested
pointsize in scaled points. .pvs] The current post-vertical
line spacing. .rj] The number of lines to be right-justified
as set by the rj request. .s] Current point size as a
decimal fraction. .sr] The last requested pointsize in
points as a decimal fraction (string-valued). .t] Distance
to the next trap. .T] Set to 1 if option -T is used. .tabs]
A string representation of the current tab settings suitable
for use as an argument to the ta request. .trunc] The amount
of vertical space truncated by the most recently sprung
vertical position trap, or, if the trap was sprung by a ne
request, minus the amount of vertical motion produced by
.ne. In other words, at the point a trap is sprung, it rep-
resents the difference of what the vertical position would
have been but for the trap, and what the vertical position
actually is. Useful in conjunction with the register .ne
register. .ss] The value of the parameters set by the first
argument of the ss request. .sss] The value of the
parameters set by the second argument of the ss request. .u]
Equal to 1 bin fill mode and 0 in nofill mode. .v] Current
vertical line spacing. .V] Available vertical resolution in
basic units. .vpt] 1 if vertical position traps are enabled,
0 otherwise. .w] Width of previous character. .warn] The sum
of the number codes of the currently enabled warn- ings. .x]
The major version number. .y] The minor version number. .Y]
The revision number of groff. .z] Name of current
diversion.</p>
