<p>DEPMOD.CONF(5) DEPMOD.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME depmod.conf, depmod.d - Configuration
file/directory for depmod</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The order in which modules are processed by
the depmod command can be altered on a global or per-module
basis. This is typically useful in cases where built-in
kernel modules are complemented by custom built versions of
the same and the user wishes to affect the priority of pro-
cessing in order to override the module version supplied by
the kernel.</p>

<p>The format of depmod.conf and files under depmod.d is
simple: one com- mand per line, with blank lines and lines
starting with # ignored (useful for adding comments). A at
the end of a line causes it to continue on the next line,
which makes the file a bit neater.</p>

<p>COMMANDS search subdirectory... This allows you to
specify the order in which /lib/modules (or other configured
module location) subdirectories will be pro- cessed by
depmod. Directories are listed in order, with the highest
priority given to the first listed directory and the lowest
priority given to the last directory listed. The special
keyword built-in refers to the standard module directories
installed by the kernel.</p>

<p>By default, depmod will give a higher priority to a
directory with the name updates using this built-in search
string: &quot;updates built-in&quot; but more complex
arrangements are possible and are used in several popular
distributions.</p>

<p>override modulename kernelversion modulesubdirectory
This command allows you to override which version of a
specific module will be used when more than one module
sharing the same name is processed by the depmod command. It
is possible to spec- ify one kernel or all kernels using the
* wildcard. modulesub- directory is the name of the
subdirectory under /lib/modules (or other module location)
where the target module is installed.</p>

<p>For example, it is possible to override the priority of
an updated test module called kmp by specifying the
following com- mand: &quot;override kmp * extra&quot;. This
will ensure that any match- ing module name installed under
the extra subdirectory within /lib/modules (or other module
location) will take priority over any likenamed module
already provided by the kernel.</p>
