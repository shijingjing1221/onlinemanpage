<p>NAME smbtree - A text based smb network browser</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smbtree [-b] [-D] [-S]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>smbtree is a smb browser program in text mode. It is
similar to the &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot; found on
Windows computers. It prints a tree with all the known
domains, the servers in those domains and the shares on the
servers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b|--broadcast Query network nodes by sending
requests as broadcasts instead of querying the local master
browser.</p>

<p>-D|--domains Only print a list of all the domains known
on broadcast or by the master browser</p>

<p>-S|--servers Only print a list of all the domains and
servers responding on broadcast or known by the master
browser.</p>

<p>-d|--debuglevel=level level is an integer from 0 to 10.
The default value if this parameter is not specified is
0.</p>

<p>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to
the log files about the activities of the server. At level
0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.
Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it
generates a small amount of information about operations
carried out.</p>

<p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p>Note that specifying this parameter here will override
the log level parameter in the smb.conf file.</p>

<p>-V|--version Prints the program version number.</p>

<p>-s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt; The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>-l|--log-basename=logdirectory Base directory name for
log/debug files. The extension &quot;.progname&quot; will be
appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
file is never removed by the client.</p>

<p>-N|--no-pass If specified, this parameter suppresses the
normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is
useful when accessing a service that does not require a
password.</p>

<p>Unless a password is specified on the command line or
this parameter is specified, the client will request a
password.</p>

<p>If a password is specified on the command line and this
option is also defined the password on the command line will
be silently ingnored and no password will be used.</p>

<p>-k|--kerberos Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only
useful in an Active Directory environment.</p>

<p>-C|--use-ccache Try to use the credentials cached by
winbind.</p>

<p>-A|--authentication-file=filename This option allows you
to specify a file from which to read the username and
password used in the connection. The format of the file
is</p>

<p>username = &lt;value&gt; password = &lt;value&gt; domain
= &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict
access from unwanted users.</p>

<p>-U|--user=username[%password] Sets the SMB username or
username and password.</p>

<p>If %password is not specified, the user will be
prompted. The client will first check the USER environment
variable, then the LOGNAME variable and if either exists,
the string is uppercased. If these environmental variables
are not found, the username GUEST is used.</p>

<p>A third option is to use a credentials file which
contains the plaintext of the username and password. This
option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does
not wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via
environment variables. If this method is used, make certain
that the permissions on the file restrict access from
unwanted users. See the -A for more details.</p>

<p>Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also,
on many systems the command line of a running process may be
seen via the ps command. To be safe always allow rpcclient
to prompt for a password and type it in directly.</p>

<p>-?|--help Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The smbtree man page was written by Jelmer Vernooij.</p>
