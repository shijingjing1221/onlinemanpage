<p>NAME perldelta - what is new for perl v5.10.1</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.10.0 release and the 5.10.1 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as
5.8.8, first read the perl5100delta, which describes
differences between 5.8.8 and 5.10.0</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes Switch statement changes The
handling of complex expressions by the
&quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; switch statement has been
enhanced. There are two new cases where &quot;when&quot; now
interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an
expression to be used in a smart match:</p>

<p>flip-flop operators The &quot;..&quot; and
&quot;...&quot; flip-flop operators are now evaluated in
boolean context, following their usual semantics; see
&quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p>Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, &quot;when (1..10)&quot;
will not work to test whether a given value is an integer
between 1 and 10; you should use &quot;when ([1..10])&quot;
instead (note the array reference).</p>

<p>However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop
operators in boolean context ensures it can now be useful in
a &quot;when()&quot;, notably for implementing bistable
conditions, like in:</p>

<p>when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) { # do something }</p>

<p>defined-or operator A compound expression involving the
defined-or operator, as in &quot;when (expr1 //
expr2)&quot;, will be treated as boolean if the first
expression is boolean. (This just extends the existing rule
that applies to the regular or operator, as in &quot;when
(expr1 || expr2)&quot;.)</p>

<p>The next section details more changes brought to the
semantics to the smart match operator, that naturally also
modify the behaviour of the switch statements where smart
matching is implicitly used.</p>

<p>Smart match changes Changes to type-based dispatch</p>

<p>The smart match operator &quot;~~&quot; is no longer
commutative. The behaviour of a smart match now depends
primarily on the type of its right hand argument. Moreover,
its semantics have been adjusted for greater consistency or
usefulness in several cases. While the general backwards
compatibility is maintained, several changes must be
noted:</p>

<p>&middot; Code references with an empty prototype are no
longer treated specially. They are passed an argument like
the other code references (even if they choose to ignore
it).</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;%hash ~~ sub {}&quot; and &quot;@array ~~
sub {}&quot; now test that the subroutine returns a true
value for each key of the hash (or element of the array),
instead of passing the whole hash or array as a reference to
the subroutine.</p>

<p>&middot; Due to the commutativity breakage, code
references are no longer treated specially when appearing on
the left of the &quot;~~&quot; operator, but like any vulgar
scalar.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;undef ~~ %hash&quot; is always false
(since &quot;undef&quot; can t be a key in a hash). No
implicit conversion to &quot;&quot; is done (as was the case
in perl 5.10.0).</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;$scalar ~~ @array&quot; now always
distributes the smart match across the elements of the
array. Its true if one element in @array verifies
&quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;. This is a generalization of
the old behaviour that tested whether the array contained
the scalar.</p>

<p>The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is
given in &quot;Smart matching in detail&quot; in
perlsyn.</p>

<p>Smart match and overloading</p>

<p>According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost
argument type, when an object overloading &quot;~~&quot;
appears on the right side of the operator, the overload
routine will always be called (with a 3rd argument set to a
true value, see overload.) However, when the object will
appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only
when the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way
distributivity of smart match across arrays is not broken,
as well as the other behaviours with complex types
(coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus, writers of overloading
routines for smart match mostly need to worry only with
comparing against a scalar, and possibly with
stringification overloading; the other common cases will be
automatically handled consistently.</p>

<p>&quot;~~&quot; will now refuse to work on objects that
do not overload it (in order to avoid relying on the object
s underlying structure). (However, if the object overloads
the stringification or the numification operators, and if
overload fallback is active, it will be used instead, as
usual.)</p>

<p>Other incompatible changes &middot; The semantics of
&quot;use feature :5.10*&quot; have changed slightly. See
&quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more information.</p>

<p>&middot; It is now a run-time error to use the smart
match operator &quot;~~&quot; with an object that has no
overload defined for it. (This way &quot;~~&quot; will not
break encapsulation by matching against the objects internal
representation as a reference.)</p>

<p>&middot; The version control system used for the
development of the perl interpreter has been switched from
Perforce to git. This is mainly an internal issue that only
affects people actively working on the perl core; but it may
have minor external visibility, for example in some of
details of the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;. See
perlrepository for more information.</p>

<p>&middot; The internal structure of the &quot;ext/&quot;
directory in the perl source has been reorganised. In
general, a module &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; whose source was
stored under ext/Foo/Bar/ is now located under ext/Foo-Bar/.
Also, some modules have been moved from lib/ to ext/. This
is purely a source tarball change, and should make no
difference to the compilation or installation of perl,
unless you have a very customised build process that
explicitly relies on this structure, or which hard-codes the
&quot;nonxs_ext&quot; Configure parameter. Specifically,
this change does not by default alter the location of any
files in the final installation.</p>

<p>&middot; As part of the &quot;Test::Harness&quot; 2.x to
3.x upgrade, the experimental
&quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot; module has been removed.
See &quot;Updated Modules&quot; for more details.</p>

<p>&middot; As part of the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;
upgrade, the &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes&quot; and
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish&quot; modules have been
removed from this distribution.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Module::CoreList&quot; no longer contains
the %:patchlevel hash.</p>

<p>&middot; This one is actually a change introduced in
5.10.0, but it was missed from that release s perldelta, so
it is mentioned here instead.</p>

<p>A bugfix related to the handling of the &quot;/m&quot;
modifier and &quot;qr&quot; resulted in a change of
behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:</p>

<p># matches in 5.8.x, doesn&rsquo;t match in 5.10.0 $re =
qr/^bar/; &quot;foo0ar&quot; =~ /$re/m;</p>

<p>Core Enhancements Unicode Character Database 5.1.0 The
copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl
5.10.1 has been updated to 5.1.0 from 5.0.0. See
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#NotableChanges&gt;
for the notable changes.</p>

<p>A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution
Orders As of Perl 5.10.1 there is a new interface for
plugging and using method resolution orders other than the
default (linear depth first search). The C3 method
resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re- implemented as
a plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See
perlmroapi for more information.</p>

<p>The &quot;overloading&quot; pragma This pragma allows
you to lexically disable or enable overloading for some or
all operations. (Yuval Kogman)</p>

<p>Parallel tests The core distribution can now run its
regression tests in parallel on Unix-like platforms. Instead
of running &quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot;
in your environment to the number of tests to run in
parallel, and run &quot;make test_harness&quot;. On a
Bourne-like shell, this can be done as</p>

<p>TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness # Run 3 tests in
parallel</p>

<p>An environment variable is used, rather than parallel
make itself, because TAP::Harness needs to be able to
schedule individual non- conflicting test scripts itself,
and there is no standard interface to &quot;make&quot;
utilities to interact with their job schedulers.</p>

<p>Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run
in parallel (most notably &quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;). If
necessary run just the failing scripts again sequentially
and see if the failures go away.</p>

<p>DTrace support Some support for DTrace has been added.
See &quot;DTrace support&quot; in INSTALL.</p>

<p>Support for &quot;configure_requires&quot; in CPAN
module metadata Both &quot;CPAN&quot; and
&quot;CPANPLUS&quot; now support the
&quot;configure_requires&quot; keyword in the
&quot;META.yml&quot; metadata file included in most recent
CPAN distributions. This allows distribution authors to
specify configuration prerequisites that must be installed
before running Makefile.PL or Build.PL.</p>

<p>See the documentation for
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; or &quot;Module::Build&quot;
for more on how to specify &quot;configure_requires&quot;
when creating a distribution for CPAN.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata New Modules and Pragmata
&quot;autodie&quot; This is a new lexically-scoped
alternative for the &quot;Fatal&quot; module. The bundled
version is 2.06_01. Note that in this release, using a
string eval when &quot;autodie&quot; is in effect can cause
the autodie behaviour to leak into the surrounding scope.
See &quot;BUGS&quot; in autodie for more details.</p>

<p>&quot;Compress::Raw::Bzip2&quot; This has been added to
the core (version 2.020).</p>

<p>&quot;parent&quot; This pragma establishes an ISA
relationship with base classes at compile time. It provides
the key feature of &quot;base&quot; without the feature
creep.</p>

<p>&quot;Parse::CPAN::Meta&quot; This has been added to the
core (version 1.39).</p>

<p>Pragmata Changes &quot;attributes&quot; Upgraded from
version 0.08 to 0.09.</p>

<p>&quot;attrs&quot; Upgraded from version 1.02 to
1.03.</p>

<p>&quot;base&quot; Upgraded from version 2.13 to 2.14. See
parent for a replacement.</p>

<p>&quot;bigint&quot; Upgraded from version 0.22 to
0.23.</p>

<p>&quot;bignum&quot; Upgraded from version 0.22 to
0.23.</p>

<p>&quot;bigrat&quot; Upgraded from version 0.22 to
0.23.</p>

<p>&quot;charnames&quot; Upgraded from version 1.06 to
1.07.</p>

<p>The Unicode NameAliases.txt database file has been
added. This has the effect of adding some extra
&quot;haracter names that formerly wouldnt have been
recognised; for example, &quot;ATIN CAPITAL LETTER
GHA}&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;constant&quot; Upgraded from version 1.13 to
1.17.</p>

<p>&quot;feature&quot; The meaning of the &quot;:5.10&quot;
and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; feature bundles has changed
slightly. The last component, if any (i.e. &quot;X&quot;) is
simply ignored. This is predicated on the assumption that
new features will not, in general, be added to maintenance
releases. So &quot;:5.10&quot; and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; have
identical effect. This is a change to the behaviour
documented for 5.10.0.</p>

<p>&quot;fields&quot; Upgraded from version 2.13 to 2.14

changes).</p>

<p>Utility Changes h2ph Now looks in
&quot;include-fixed&quot; too, which is a recent addition to
gccs search path.</p>

<p>h2xs No longer incorrectly treats enum values like
macros (Daniel Burr).</p>

<p>Now handles C++ style constants (&quot;//&quot;)
properly in enums. (A patch from Rainer Weikusat was used;
Daniel Burr also proposed a similar fix).</p>

<p>perl5db.pl &quot;LVALUE&quot; subroutines now work under
the debugger.</p>

<p>The debugger now correctly handles proxy constant
subroutines, and subroutine stubs.</p>

<p>perlthanks Perl 5.10.1 adds a new utility perlthanks,
which is a variant of perlbug, but for sending
non-bug-reports to the authors and maintainers of Perl.
Getting nothing but bug reports can become a bit
demoralising: well see if this changes things.</p>

<p>New Documentation perlhaiku This contains instructions
on how to build perl for the Haiku platform.</p>

<p>perlmroapi This describes the new interface for
pluggable Method Resolution Orders.</p>

<p>perlperf This document, by Richard Foley, provides an
introduction to the use of performance and optimization
techniques which can be used with particular reference to
perl programs.</p>

<p>perlrepository This describes how to access the perl
source using the git version control system.</p>

<p>perlthanks This describes the new perlthanks
utility.</p>

<p>Changes to Existing Documentation The various large
&quot;Changes*&quot; files (which listed every change made
to perl over the last 18 years) have been removed, and
replaced by a small file, also called &quot;Changes&quot;,
which just explains how that same information may be
extracted from the git version control system.</p>

<p>The file Porting/patching.pod has been deleted, as it
mainly described interacting with the old Perforce-based
repository, which is now obsolete. Information still
relevant has been moved to perlrepository.</p>

<p>perlapi, perlintern, perlmodlib and perltoc are now all
generated at build time, rather than being shipped as part
of the release.</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements &middot; A new internal cache
means that &quot;isa()&quot; will often be faster.</p>

<p>&middot; Under &quot;use locale&quot;, the
locale-relevant information is now cached on read-only
values, such as the list returned by &quot;keys %hash&quot;.
This makes operations such as &quot;sort keys %hash&quot; in
the scope of &quot;use locale&quot; much faster.</p>

<p>&middot; Empty &quot;DESTROY&quot; methods are no longer
called.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements ext/
reorganisation The layout of directories in ext has been
revised. Specifically, all extensions are now flat, and at
the top level, with &quot;/&quot; in pathnames replaced by
&quot;-&quot;, so that ext/Data/Dumper/ is now
ext/Data-Dumper/, etc. The names of the extensions as
specified to Configure, and as reported by %Config::Config
under the keys &quot;dynamic_ext&quot;,
&quot;known_extensions&quot;, &quot;nonxs_ext&quot; and
&quot;static_ext&quot; have not changed, and still use
&quot;/&quot;. Hence this change will not have any affect
once perl is installed. However,
&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot;, &quot;Safe&quot; and
&quot;mro&quot; have now become extensions in their own
right, so if you run Configure with options to specify an
exact list of extensions to build, you will need to change
it to account for this.</p>

<p>For 5.10.2, it is planned that many dual-life modules
will have been moved from lib to ext; again this will have
no effect on an installed perl, but will matter if you
invoke Configure with a pre-canned list of extensions to
build.</p>

<p>Configuration improvements If &quot;vendorlib&quot; and
&quot;vendorarch&quot; are the same, then they are only
added to @INC once.</p>

<p>$Config{usedevel} and the C-level
&quot;PERL_USE_DEVEL&quot; are now defined if perl is built
with &quot;-Dusedevel&quot;.</p>

<p>Configure will enable use of
&quot;-fstack-protector&quot;, to provide protection against
stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.</p>

<p>Configure will now determine the correct prototypes for
re-entrant functions, and for &quot;gconvert&quot;, if you
are using a C++ compiler rather than a C compiler.</p>

<p>On Unix, if you build from a tree containing a git
repository, the configuration process will note the commit
hash you have checked out, for display in the output of
&quot;perl -v&quot; and &quot;perl -V&quot;. Unpushed local
commits are automatically added to the list of local patches
displayed by &quot;perl -V&quot;.</p>

<p>Compilation improvements As part of the flattening of
ext, all extensions on all platforms are built by
make_ext.pl. This replaces the Unix-specific
ext/util/make_ext, VMS-specific make_ext.com and
Win32-specific win32/buildext.pl.</p>

<p>Platform Specific Changes AIX Removed libbsd for AIX 5L
and 6.1. Only flock() was used from libbsd.</p>

<p>Removed libgdbm for AIX 5L and 6.1. The libgdbm is
delivered as an optional package with the AIX Toolbox.
Unfortunately the 64 bit version is broken.</p>

<p>Hints changes mean that AIX 4.2 should work again.</p>

<p>Cygwin On Cygwin we now strip the last number from the
DLL. This has been the behaviour in the cygwin.com build for
years. The hints files have been updated.</p>

<p>FreeBSD The hints files now identify the correct
threading libraries on FreeBSD 7 and later.</p>

<p>Irix We now work around a bizarre preprocessor bug in
the Irix 6.5 compiler: &quot;cc -E -&quot; unfortunately
goes into K&amp;R mode, but &quot;cc -E file.c&quot;
doesnt.</p>

<p>Haiku Patches from the Haiku maintainers have been
merged in. Perl should now build on Haiku.</p>

<p>MirOS BSD Perl should now build on MirOS BSD.</p>

<p>NetBSD Hints now supports versions 5.*.</p>

<p>Stratus VOS Various changes from Stratus have been
merged in.</p>

<p>Symbian There is now support for Symbian S60 3.2 SDK and
S60 5.0 SDK.</p>

<p>Win32 Improved message window handling means that
&quot;alarm&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; messages will no
longer be dropped under race conditions.</p>

<p>VMS Reads from the in-memory temporary files of
&quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; used to fail if $/ was set to a
numeric reference (to indicate record- style reads). This is
now fixed.</p>

<p>VMS now supports &quot;getgrgid&quot;.</p>

<p>Many improvements and cleanups have been made to the VMS
file name handling and conversion code.</p>

<p>Enabling the &quot;PERL_VMS_POSIX_EXIT&quot; logical
name now encodes a POSIX exit status in a VMS condition
value for better interaction with GNV s bash shell and other
utilities that depend on POSIX exit values. See
&quot;$?&quot; in perlvms for details.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes &middot; 5.10.0 inadvertently
disabled an optimisation, which caused a measurable
performance drop in list assignment, such as is often used
to assign function parameters from @_. The optimisation has
been re-instated, and the performance regression fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Fixed memory leak on &quot;while (1) { map 1, 1
}&quot; [RT #53038].</p>

<p>&middot; Some potential coredumps in PerlIO fixed [RT
#57322,54828].</p>

<p>&middot; The debugger now works with lvalue
subroutines.</p>

<p>&middot; The debuggers &quot;m&quot; command was broken
on modules that defined constants [RT #61222].</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;crypt()&quot; and string complement could
return tainted values for untainted arguments [RT
#59998].</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;-i.suffix&quot; command-line switch
now recreates the file using restricted permissions, before
changing its mode to match the original file. This
eliminates a potential race condition [RT #60904].</p>

<p>&middot; On some UNIX systems, the value in $? would not
have the top bit set (&quot;$? &amp; 128&quot;) even if the
child core dumped.</p>

<p>&middot; Under some circumstances, $^R could incorrectly
become undefined [RT #57042].</p>

<p>&middot; (XS) In various hash functions, passing a
pre-computed hash to when the key is UTF-8 might result in
an incorrect lookup.</p>

<p>&middot; (XS) Including XSUB.h before perl.h gave a
compile-time error [RT #57176].</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;$object-&gt;isa(&rsquo;Foo&rsquo;)&quot;
would report false if the package &quot;Foo&quot; didnt
exist, even if the objects @ISA contained
&quot;Foo&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Various bugs in the new-to 5.10.0 mro code,
triggered by manipulating @ISA, have been found and
fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Bitwise operations on references could crash
the interpreter, e.g. &quot;$x=; $x |= &quot;foo&quot;&quot;
[RT #54956].</p>

<p>&middot; Patterns including alternation might be
sensitive to the internal UTF-8 representation, e.g.</p>

<p>my $byte = chr(192); my $utf8 = chr(192);
utf8::upgrade($utf8); $utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i; # failed in
5.10.0</p>

<p>&middot; Within UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e.
where &quot;use utf8&quot; is in effect), double-quoted
literal strings could be corrupted where a &quot;&quot;,
&quot; NNN&quot; or &quot;&quot; is followed by a literal
character with ordinal value greater than 255 [RT
#59908].</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;B::Deparse&quot; failed to correctly
deparse various constructs: &quot;readpipe STRING&quot; [RT
#62428], &quot;CORE::require(STRING)&quot; [RT #62488],
&quot;sub foo(_)&quot; [RT #62484].</p>

<p>&middot; Using &quot;setpgrp()&quot; with no arguments
could corrupt the perl stack.</p>

<p>&middot; The block form of &quot;eval&quot; is now
specifically trappable by &quot;Safe&quot; and
&quot;ops&quot;. Previously it was erroneously treated like
string &quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; In 5.10.0, the two characters &quot;[~&quot;
were sometimes parsed as the smart match operator
(&quot;~~&quot;) [RT #63854].</p>

<p>&middot; In 5.10.0, the &quot;*&quot; quantifier in
patterns was sometimes treated as &quot;{0,32767}&quot; [RT
#60034, #60464]. For example, this match would fail:</p>

<p>(&quot;ab&quot; x 32768) =~ /^(ab)*$/</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;shmget&quot; was limited to a 32 bit
segment size on a 64 bit OS [RT #63924].</p>

<p>&middot; Using &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot; to
exit a &quot;given&quot; block no longer produces a spurious
warning like the following:</p>

<p>Exiting given via last at foo.pl line 123</p>

<p>&middot; On Windows, &rsquo;.o&rsquo; and
&rsquo;..o&rsquo; were treated differently than
&rsquo;./foo&rsquo; and &rsquo;../foo&rsquo; by
&quot;do&quot; and &quot;require&quot; [RT #63492].</p>

<p>&middot; Assigning a format to a glob could corrupt the
format; e.g.:</p>

<p>*bar=*foo{FORMAT}; # foo format now bad</p>

<p>&middot; Attempting to coerce a typeglob to a string or
number could cause an assertion failure. The correct error
message is now generated, &quot;Can&rsquo;t coerce GLOB to
$type&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Under &quot;use filetest
&rsquo;access&rsquo;&quot;, &quot;-x&quot; was using the
wrong access mode. This has been fixed [RT #49003].</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;length&quot; on a tied scalar that
returned a Unicode value would not be correct the first
time. This has been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Using an array &quot;tie&quot; inside in array
&quot;tie&quot; could SEGV. This has been fixed. [RT
#51636]</p>

<p>&middot; A race condition inside
&quot;PerlIOStdio_close()&quot; has been identified and
fixed. This used to cause various threading issues,
including SEGVs.</p>

<p>&middot; In &quot;unpack&quot;, the use of
&quot;()&quot; groups in scalar context was internally
placing a list on the interpreters stack, which manifested
in various ways, including SEGVs. This is now fixed [RT
#50256].</p>

<p>&middot; Magic was called twice in &quot;substr&quot;,
&quot;$x&quot;, &quot;tie $x, $m&quot; and &quot;chop&quot;.
These have all been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; A 5.10.0 optimisation to clear the temporary
stack within the implicit loop of &quot;s///ge&quot; has
been reverted, as it turned out to be the cause of obscure
bugs in seemingly unrelated parts of the interpreter [commit
ef0d4e17921ee3de].</p>

<p>&middot; The line numbers for warnings inside
&quot;elsif&quot; are now correct.</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;..&quot; operator now works correctly
with ranges whose ends are at or close to the values of the
smallest and largest integers.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;binmode STDIN, &rsquo;:raw&rsquo;&quot;
could lead to segmentation faults on some platforms. This
has been fixed [RT #54828].</p>

<p>&middot; An off-by-one error meant that &quot;index
$str, ...&quot; was effectively being executed as
&quot;index &quot;$str &quot;, ...&quot;. This has been
fixed [RT #53746].</p>

<p>&middot; Various leaks associated with named captures in
regexes have been fixed [RT #57024].</p>

<p>&middot; A weak reference to a hash would leak. This was
affecting &quot;DBI&quot; [RT #56908].</p>

<p>&middot; Using (?|) in a regex could cause a segfault
[RT #59734].</p>

<p>&middot; Use of a UTF-8 &quot;tr//&quot; within a
closure could cause a segfault [RT #61520].</p>

<p>&middot; Calling &quot;sv_chop()&quot; or otherwise
upgrading an SV could result in an unaligned 64-bit access
on the SPARC architecture [RT #60574].</p>

<p>&middot; In the 5.10.0 release,
&quot;inc_version_list&quot; would incorrectly list
&quot;5.10.*&quot; after &quot;5.8.*&quot;; this affected
the @INC search order [RT #67628].</p>

<p>&middot; In 5.10.0, &quot;pack &quot;a*&quot;,
$tainted_value&quot; returned a non-tainted value [RT
#52552].</p>

<p>&middot; In 5.10.0, &quot;printf&quot; and
&quot;sprintf&quot; could produce the fatal error
&quot;panic: utf8_mg_pos_cache_update&quot; when printing
UTF-8 strings [RT #62666].</p>

<p>&middot; In the 5.10.0 release, a dynamically created
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; method might be missed (method cache
issue) [RT #60220,60232].</p>

<p>&middot; In the 5.10.0 release, a combination of
&quot;use feature&quot; and &quot;//ee&quot; could cause a
memory leak [RT #63110].</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;-C&quot; on the shebang (&quot;#!&quot;)
line is once more permitted if it is also specified on the
command line. &quot;-C&quot; on the shebang line used to be
a silent no-op if it was not also on the command line, so
perl 5.10.0 disallowed it, which broke some scripts. Now
perl checks whether it is also on the command line and only
dies if it is not [RT #67880].</p>

<p>&middot; In 5.10.0, certain types of re-entrant regular
expression could crash, or cause the following assertion
failure [RT #60508]:</p>

<p>Assertion rx-&gt;sublen &gt;= (s - rx-&gt;subbeg) + i
failed</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics &quot;panic: sv_chop %s&quot;
This new fatal error occurs when the C routine
&quot;Perl_sv_chop()&quot; was passed a position that is not
within the scalar s string buffer. This could be caused by
buggy XS code, and at this point recovery is not
possible.</p>

<p>&quot;Can&rsquo;t locate package %s for the parents of
%s&quot; This warning has been removed. In general, it only
got produced in conjunction with other warnings, and
removing it allowed an ISA lookup optimisation to be
added.</p>

<p>&quot;v-string in use/require is non-portable&quot; This
warning has been removed.</p>

<p>&quot;Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;&quot;
It is now possible to change the depth threshold for this
warning from the default of 100, by recompiling the perl
binary, setting the C pre-processor macro
&quot;PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN&quot; to the desired value.</p>

<p>Changed Internals &middot; The J.R.R. Tolkien quotes at
the head of C source file have been checked and proper
citations added, thanks to a patch from Tom
Christiansen.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;vcroak()&quot; now accepts a null first
argument. In addition, a full audit was made of the
&quot;not NULL&quot; compiler annotations, and those for
several other internal functions were corrected.</p>

<p>&middot; New macros &quot;dSAVEDERRNO&quot;,
&quot;dSAVE_ERRNO&quot;, &quot;SAVE_ERRNO&quot;,
&quot;RESTORE_ERRNO&quot; have been added to formalise the
temporary saving of the &quot;errno&quot; variable.</p>

<p>&middot; The function &quot;Perl_sv_insert_flags&quot;
has been added to augment &quot;Perl_sv_insert&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; The function &quot;Perl_newSV_type(type)&quot;
has been added, equivalent to &quot;Perl_newSV()&quot;
followed by &quot;Perl_sv_upgrade(type)&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; The function &quot;Perl_newSVpvn_flags()&quot;
has been added, equivalent to &quot;Perl_newSVpvn()&quot;
and then performing the action relevant to the flag.</p>

<p>Two flag bits are currently supported.</p>

<p>&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot; This will call
&quot;SvUTF8_on()&quot; for you. (Note that this does not
convert an sequence of ISO 8859-1 characters to UTF-8). A
wrapper, &quot;newSVpvn_utf8()&quot; is available for
this.</p>

<p>&quot;SVs_TEMP&quot; Call &quot;sv_2mortal()&quot; on
the new SV.</p>

<p>There is also a wrapper that takes constant strings,
&quot;newSVpvs_flags()&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; The function &quot;Perl_croak_xs_usage&quot;
has been added as a wrapper to &quot;Perl_croak&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; The functions &quot;PerlIO_find_layer&quot; and
&quot;PerlIO_list_alloc&quot; are now exported.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;PL_na&quot; has been exterminated from
the core code, replaced by local STRLEN temporaries, or
&quot;*_nolen()&quot; calls. Either approach is faster than
&quot;PL_na&quot;, which is a pointer deference into the
interpreter structure under ithreads, and a global variable
otherwise.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Perl_mg_free()&quot; used to leave freed
memory accessible via SvMAGIC() on the scalar. It now
updates the linked list to remove each piece of magic as it
is freed.</p>

<p>&middot; Under ithreads, the regex in
&quot;PL_reg_curpm&quot; is now reference counted. This
eliminates a lot of hackish workarounds to cope with it not
being reference counted.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Perl_mg_magical()&quot; would sometimes
incorrectly turn on &quot;SvRMAGICAL()&quot;. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; The public IV and NV flags are now not set if
the string value has trailing &quot;garbage&quot;. This
behaviour is consistent with not setting the public IV or NV
flags if the value is out of range for the type.</p>

<p>&middot; SV allocation tracing has been added to the
diagnostics enabled by &quot;-Dm&quot;. The tracing can
alternatively output via the &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot;
mechanism, if that was enabled when the perl binary was
compiled.</p>

<p>&middot; Uses of &quot;Nullav&quot;, &quot;Nullcv&quot;,
&quot;Nullhv&quot;, &quot;Nullop&quot;, &quot;Nullsv&quot;
etc have been replaced by &quot;NULL&quot; in the core code,
and non-dual-life modules, as &quot;NULL&quot; is clearer to
those unfamiliar with the core code.</p>

<p>&middot; A macro MUTABLE_PTR(p) has been added, which on
(non-pedantic) gcc will not cast away &quot;const&quot;,
returning a &quot;void *&quot;. Macros
&quot;MUTABLE_SV(av)&quot;, &quot;MUTABLE_SV(cv)&quot; etc
build on this, casting to &quot;AV *&quot; etc without
casting away &quot;const&quot;. This allows proper
compile-time auditing of &quot;const&quot; correctness in
the core, and helped picked up some errors (now fixed).</p>

<p>&middot; Macros &quot;mPUSHs()&quot; and
&quot;mXPUSHs()&quot; have been added, for pushing SVs on
the stack and mortalizing them.</p>

<p>&middot; Use of the private structure
&quot;mro_meta&quot; has changed slightly. Nothing outside
the core should be accessing this directly anyway.</p>

<p>&middot; A new tool, &quot;Porting/expand-macro.pl&quot;
has been added, that allows you to view how a C preprocessor
macro would be expanded when compiled. This is handy when
trying to decode the macro hell that is the perl guts.</p>

<p>New Tests Many modules updated from CPAN incorporate new
tests.</p>

<p>Several tests that have the potential to hang forever if
they fail now incorporate a &quot;watchdog&quot;
functionality that will kill them after a timeout, which
helps ensure that &quot;make test&quot; and &quot;make
test_harness&quot; run to completion automatically. (Jerry
Hedden).</p>

<p>Some core-specific tests have been added:</p>

<p>t/comp/retainedlines.t Check that the debugger can
retain source lines from &quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p>t/io/perlio_fail.t Check that bad layers fail.</p>

<p>t/io/perlio_leaks.t Check that PerlIO layers are not
leaking.</p>

<p>t/io/perlio_open.t Check that certain special forms of
open work.</p>

<p>t/io/perlio.t General PerlIO tests.</p>

<p>t/io/pvbm.t Check that there is no unexpected
interaction between the internal types &quot;PVBM&quot; and
&quot;PVGV&quot;.</p>

<p>t/mro/package_aliases.t Check that mro works properly in
the presence of aliased packages.</p>

<p>t/op/dbm.t Tests for &quot;dbmopen&quot; and
&quot;dbmclose&quot;.</p>

<p>t/op/index_thr.t Tests for the interaction of
&quot;index&quot; and threads.</p>

<p>t/op/pat_thr.t Tests for the interaction of esoteric
patterns and threads.</p>

<p>t/op/qr_gc.t Test that &quot;qr&quot; doesnt leak.</p>

<p>t/op/reg_email_thr.t Tests for the interaction of regex
recursion and threads.</p>

<p>t/op/regexp_qr_embed_thr.t Tests for the interaction of
patterns with embedded &quot;qr//&quot; and threads.</p>

<p>t/op/regexp_unicode_prop.t Tests for Unicode properties
in regular expressions.</p>

<p>t/op/regexp_unicode_prop_thr.t Tests for the interaction
of Unicode properties and threads.</p>

<p>t/op/reg_nc_tie.t Test the tied methods of
&quot;Tie::Hash::NamedCapture&quot;.</p>

<p>t/op/reg_posixcc.t Check that POSIX character classes
behave consistently.</p>

<p>t/op/re.t Check that exportable &quot;re&quot; functions
in universal.c work.</p>

<p>t/op/setpgrpstack.t Check that &quot;setpgrp&quot;
works.</p>

<p>t/op/substr_thr.t Tests for the interaction of
&quot;substr&quot; and threads.</p>

<p>t/op/upgrade.t Check that upgrading and assigning
scalars works.</p>

<p>t/uni/lex_utf8.t Check that Unicode in the lexer
works.</p>

<p>t/uni/tie.t Check that Unicode and &quot;tie&quot;
work.</p>

<p>Known Problems This is a list of some significant
unfixed bugs, which are regressions from either 5.10.0 or
5.8.x.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;List::Util::first&quot; misbehaves in the
presence of a lexical $_ (typically introduced by &quot;my
$_&quot; or implicitly by &quot;given&quot;). The variable
which gets set for each iteration is the package variable
$_, not the lexical $_ [RT #67694].</p>

<p>A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide
functions which take a block as their first argument,
like</p>

<p>foo { ... $_ ...} list</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;charnames&quot; pragma may generate a
run-time error when a regex is interpolated [RT #56444]:</p>

<p>use charnames &rsquo;:full&rsquo;; my $r1 = qr/HAI
CHARACTER SARA I}/; &quot;foo&quot; =~ $r1; # okay
&quot;foo&quot; =~ /$r1+/; # runtime error</p>

<p>A workaround is to generate the character outside of the
regex:</p>

<p>my $a = &quot;HAI CHARACTER SARA I}&quot;; my $r1 =
qr/$a/;</p>

<p>&middot; Some regexes may run much more slowly when run

<p>Deprecations The following items are now deprecated.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;Switch&quot; is buggy and should be
avoided. From perl 5.11.0 onwards, it is intended that any
use of the core version of this module will emit a warning,
and that the module will eventually be removed from the core
(probably in perl 5.14.0). See &quot;Switch statements&quot;
in perlsyn for its replacement.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;suidperl&quot; will be removed in 5.12.0.
This provides a mechanism to emulate setuid permission bits
on systems that dont support it properly.</p>

<p>Acknowledgements Some of the work in this release was
funded by a TPF grant.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark officially retired from maintenance
pumpking duty at the end of 2008; however in reality he has
put much effort in since then to help get 5.10.1 into a fit
state to be released, including writing a considerable chunk
of this perldelta.</p>

<p>Steffen Mueller and David Golden in particular helped
getting CPAN modules polished and synchronised with their
in-core equivalents.</p>

<p>Craig Berry was tireless in getting maint to run under
VMS, no matter how many times we broke it for him.</p>

<p>The other core committers contributed most of the
changes, and applied most of the patches sent in by the
hundreds of contributors listed in AUTHORS.</p>

<p>(Sorry to all the people I havent mentioned by
name).</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to Larry Wall, without whom none of this
would be necessary.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information
at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications,
which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived
mailing list, then please send it to
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of
issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this
address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
