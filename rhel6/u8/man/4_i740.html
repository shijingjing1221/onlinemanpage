<p>NAME i740 - Intel i740 video driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;i740&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION i740 is an Xorg driver for Intel i740 video
cards.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE The i740 driver supports Intel 740
based cards. A list of cards reported to work is provided in
the README file with the driver source.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver auto-detects all device information necessary
to initialize the card.</p>

<p>However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you
can specify:</p>

<p>VideoRam - in kilobytes</p>

<p>DacSpeed - in MHz</p>

<p>MemBase - physical address of the linear framebuffer</p>

<p>IOBase - physical address of the memory mapped IO
registers</p>

<p>The following driver options are supported on all
chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable 2D acceleration. Default: acceleration is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Request
a software cursor (hardware is default). Default: off</p>

<p>Option &quot;SDRAM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force the
use of SDRAM timings. Default: off</p>

<p>Option &quot;SGRAM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force the
use of SGRAM timings. Default: off</p>

<p>Option &quot;SlowRam&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force the
use of slower ram timings. Default: off</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force the
use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default). Default: off</p>

<p>Option &quot;UsePIO&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force the
use of programmed IO (Memory mapped is the default).
Default: off</p>

<p>Note: the i740 X server should automatically detect
whether your card has SGRAM or SDRAM. Use the
&quot;sgram&quot; and &quot;sdram&quot; options if it is
incorrectly detected.</p>
