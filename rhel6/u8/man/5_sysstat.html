<p>NAME sysstat - sysstat configuration file.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file is read by sa1(8) and sa2(8) shell
scripts from the sysstats set of tools. It consists of a
sequence of shell variable assignments used to configure
sysstat logging. The variables and their meanings are:</p>

<p>COMPRESSAFTER Number of days after which daily data
files are to be com- pressed. The compression program is
given in the ZIP variable.</p>

<p>HISTORY The number of days during which a daily data
file or a report should be kept. Data files or reports older
than this number of days will be removed by the sa2(8) shell
script. Data files and reports are normally saved in the
/var/log/sa directory, under the name saDD (for data files)
or sarDD (for reports), where the DD parameter indicates the
current day.</p>

<p>The number of files actually kept in the /var/log/sa
directory may be slightly higher than the HISTORY value due
to the way the sa2 script figures out which files are to be
removed (see below &quot;How the sa2(8) script applies
HISTORY value&quot;). Using a value of 28 keeps a whole
months worth of data.</p>

<p>How the sa2(8) script applies HISTORY value</p>

<p>The sa2 script uses the &quot;find&quot; command with
the &quot;-mtime&quot; option to figure out which files are
to be removed. The &quot;find&quot; command interprets this
value as &quot;N 24 hour periods&quot;, ignoring any frac-
tional part. This means that the last modified time of a
given sa[r]DD data or report file, using a HISTORY of 1, has
to have been modified at least two days ago before it will
be removed. And for a HISTORY of 28 that would mean 29 days
ago.</p>

<p>To figure out how a HISTORY of 28 is applied in
practice, we need to consider that the sa2 script that
issues the &quot;find&quot; com- mand to remove the old
files typically runs just before mid- night on a given
system, and since the first record from sadc can also be
written to the previous days data file (thereby moving its
modification time up a bit), the sa2 script will leave 30
files untouched. So for a setting of 28, and counting the
data file of the current day, there will always be 31 files
(or 30 files, depending on the number of days in a month) in
the /var/log/sa directory during the majority of a given
day. E.g.:</p>

<p>April 30th: 31 files (Apr 30th-1st, Mar 31th) May 1st:
30 files (May 1st, Apr 30th-2nd)</p>

<p>Yet we can note the following exceptions (as inspected
at Noon of the given day):</p>

<p>February 28th: 31 files (Feb 28th-1st, Jan 31st, 30th
&amp; 29th) March 1st: 30 files (Mar 1st, Feb 28th-2nd, Jan
31st &amp; 30th) March 2nd: 29 files (Mar 1st &amp; 2nd, Feb
28th-3rd, Jan. 31st) March 3rd: 28 files (Mar 1st-3rd, Feb
28th-4th) March 4th - March 28th: 28 files March 29th: 29
files March 30th: 30 files March 31st: 31 files</p>

<p>(Determining the number of files in March on a leap year
is left as an exercise for the reader).</p>

<p>SADC_OPTIONS Options that should be passed to sadc(8).
With these options (see sadc(8) manual page), you can select
some additional data which are going to be saved in daily
data files. These options are used only when a new data file
is created. They will be ignored with an already existing
one.</p>

<p>ZIP Program used to compress data and report files.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sysconfig/sysstat</p>
