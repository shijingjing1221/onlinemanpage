<p>NAME ppmlabel - add text to a PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmlabel</p>

<p>[-angle angle]</p>

<p>[-background { transparent | color } ]</p>

<p>[-color color]</p>

<p>[-file filename]</p>

<p>[-size</p>

<p>textsize]</p>

<p>[-text text_string]</p>

<p>[-x column]</p>

<p>[-y row]</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>EXAMPLE ppmlabel -x 50 -y 50 -text hello -angle -30
-text there testimg.ppm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmlabel uses the text drawing facilities of libnetpbms
ppmd compo- nent to add text to a PBM image. You control the
location, size, base- line angle, color of the text, and
background color (if any) with com- mand line arguments. You
can specify the text on the command line or supply it in
files.</p>

<p>You can add any number of separate labels in a single
invocation of ppmlabel, limited only by any restrictions
your environment has on the number and size of program
arguments (e.g. a shells command size limit).</p>

<p>If you dont specify ppmfile, ppmlabel reads its input
PPM image from Standard Input.</p>

<p>The output image goes to Standard Output.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated way to add a label to an image is
to use pbmtext or pbmtextps to create an image of the text,
then pamcomp to overlay it onto the base image.</p>

<p>Another more general program is ppmdraw. It is slightly
harder to use for simple labelling.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The arguments on the ppmlabel command line are
not options in the strict sense; they are commands which
control the placement and appear- ance of the text being
added to the input image. They are executed left to right,
and any number of arguments may appear.</p>

<p>You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p>-angle angle This option sets the angle of the baseline
of subsequent text. angle is an integral number of degrees,
measured counterclock- wise from the row axis of the
image.</p>

<p>-background { transparent | color } If the argument is
transparent, ppmlabel draws the text over the existing
pixels in the image. If you specify a color (see the -color
option below for information on how to specify colors),
ppmlabel generates background rectangles enclosing
subsequent text, and those rectangles are filled with that
color.</p>

<p>-color color This option sets the color for subsequent
text.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>-colour is an acceptable alternate spelling.</p>

<p>-file filename This option causes ppmlabel to read lines
of text from the file named filename and draw it on
successive lines.</p>

<p>-size textsize This option sets the height of the
tallest characters above the baseline to textsize
pixels.</p>

<p>-text text_string This option causes ppmlabel to draw
the specified text string. It advances the location for
subsequent text down 1.75 times the current textsize. That
lets you draw multiple lines of text in a reasonable manner
without specifying the position of each line.</p>

<p>Note that if you invoke ppmlabel via a shell command and
your text string contains spaces, youll have to quote it so
the shell treats the whole string as a single token. E.g. $
ppmlabel -text &quot;this is my text&quot; baseimage.ppm
&gt;annotatedimage.ppm</p>

<p>-x column This option sets the pixel column at which
subsequent text will be left justified. Depending on the
shape of the first charac- ter, the actual text may begin a
few pixels to the right of this point.</p>

<p>-y row This option sets the pixel row which will form
the baseline of subsequent text. Characters with descenders,
such as &quot;y,&quot; will extend below this line.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Text strings are restricted to 7 bit ASCII.
The text font used by ppm- label doesnt include definitions
for 8 bit ISO 8859/1 characters.</p>

<p>When drawing multiple lines of text with a
non-transparent background, it should probably fill the
space between the lines with the background color. This is
tricky to get right when the text is rotated to a non-
orthogonal angle.</p>
