<p>SETPGID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETPGID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setpgid - set process group ID for job control</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setpgid() function shall either join an
existing process group or create a new process group within
the session of the calling process. The process group ID of
a session leader shall not change. Upon suc- cessful
completion, the process group ID of the process with a
process ID that matches pid shall be set to pgid. As a
special case, if pid is 0, the process ID of the calling
process shall be used. Also, if pgid is 0, the process ID of
the indicated process shall be used.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, setpgid() shall
return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno shall be
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setpgid() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES The value of the pid argument matches the process
ID of a child process of the calling process and the child
process has suc- cessfully executed one of the exec
functions.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the pgid argument is less than 0, or
is not a value supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>EPERM The process indicated by the pid argument is a
session leader.</p>

<p>EPERM The value of the pid argument matches the process
ID of a child process of the calling process and the child
process is not in the same session as the calling
process.</p>

<p>EPERM The value of the pgid argument is valid but does
not match the process ID of the process indicated by the pid
argument and there is no process with a process group ID
that matches the value of the pgid argument in the same
session as the calling process.</p>

<p>ESRCH The value of the pid argument does not match the
process ID of the calling process or of a child process of
the calling pro- cess.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The setpgid() function shall group processes
together for the purpose of signaling, placement in
foreground or background, and other job con- trol
actions.</p>

<p>The setpgid() function is similar to the setpgrp()
function of 4.2 BSD, except that 4.2 BSD allowed the
specified new process group to assume any value. This
presents certain security problems and is more flexible than
necessary to support job control.</p>

<p>To provide tighter security, setpgid() only allows the
calling process to join a process group already in use
inside its session or create a new process group whose
process group ID was equal to its process ID.</p>

<p>When a job control shell spawns a new job, the processes
in the job must be placed into a new process group via
setpgid(). There are two timing constraints involved in this
action:</p>

<p>1. The new process must be placed in the new process
group before the appropriate program is launched via one of
the exec functions.</p>

<p>2. The new process must be placed in the new process
group before the shell can correctly send signals to the new
process group.</p>

<p>To address these constraints, the following actions are
performed. The new processes call setpgid() to alter their
own process groups after fork() but before exec. This
satisfies the first constraint. Under 4.3 BSD, the second
constraint is satisfied by the synchronization property of
vfork(); that is, the shell is suspended until the child has
com- pleted the exec, thus ensuring that the child has
completed the setpgid(). A new version of fork() with this
same synchronization prop- erty was considered, but it was
decided instead to merely allow the parent shell process to
adjust the process group of its child processes via
setpgid(). Both timing constraints are now satisfied by
having both the parent shell and the child attempt to adjust
the process group of the child process; it does not matter
which succeeds first.</p>

<p>Since it would be confusing to an application to have
its process group change after it began executing (that is,
after exec), and because the child process would already
have adjusted its process group before this, the [EACCES]
error was added to disallow this.</p>

<p>One non-obvious use of setpgid() is to allow a job
control shell to return itself to its original process group
(the one in effect when the job control shell was executed).
A job control shell does this before returning control back
to its parent when it is terminating or suspend- ing itself
as a way of restoring its job control &quot;state&quot; back
to what its parent would expect. (Note that the original
process group of the job control shell typically matches the
process group of its parent, but this is not necessarily
always the case.)</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
