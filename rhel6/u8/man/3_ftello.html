<p>NAME fseeko, ftello - seek to or report file
position</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fseeko(FILE *stream, off_t offset, int whence);</p>

<p>off_t ftello(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fseeko() and ftello() functions are
identical to fseek(3) and ftell(3) (see fseek(3)),
respectively, except that the offset argument of fseeko()
and the return value of ftello() is of type off_t instead of
long.</p>

<p>On many architectures both off_t and long are 32-bit
types, but compi- lation with</p>

<p>#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64</p>

<p>will turn off_t into a 64-bit type.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On successful completion, fseeko() returns
0, while ftello() returns the current offset. Otherwise, -1
is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS See the ERRORS in fseek(3).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES These functions are found on System V-like
systems. They are not present in libc4, libc5, glibc 2.0 but
are available since glibc 2.1.</p>
