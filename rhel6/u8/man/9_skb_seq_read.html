<p>NAME skb_seq_read - Sequentially read skb data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unsigned int skb_seq_read(unsigned int
consumed, const u8 ** data, struct skb_seq_state * st);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS consumed number of bytes consumed by the
caller so far</p>

<p>data destination pointer for data to be returned</p>

<p>st state variable</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Reads a block of skb data at consumed
relative to the lower offset specified to
skb_prepare_seq_read. Assigns the head of the data block to
data and returns the length of the block or 0 if the end of
the skb data or the upper offset has been reached.</p>

<p>The caller is not required to consume all of the data
returned, i.e. consumed is typically set to the number of
bytes already consumed and the next call to skb_seq_read
will return the remaining part of the block.</p>

<p>NOTE 1 The size of each block of data returned can be
arbitary, this limitation is the cost for zerocopy
seqeuental reads of potentially non linear data.</p>

<p>NOTE 2 Fragment lists within fragments are not
implemented at the moment, state-&gt;root_skb could be
replaced with a stack for this purpose.</p>
