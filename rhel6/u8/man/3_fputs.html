<p>PUTS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual PUTS(3)</p>

<p>NAME fputc, fputs, putc, putchar, puts - output of
characters and strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>int fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>int putc(int c, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>int putchar(int c);</p>

<p>int puts(const char *s);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fputc() writes the character c, cast to an
unsigned char, to stream.</p>

<p>fputs() writes the string s to stream, without its
trailing 0&rsquo;.</p>

<p>putc() is equivalent to fputc() except that it may be
implemented as a macro which evaluates stream more than
once.</p>

<p>putchar(c); is equivalent to putc(c,stdout).</p>

<p>puts() writes the string s and a trailing newline to
stdout.</p>

<p>Calls to the functions described here can be mixed with
each other and with calls to other output functions from the
stdio library for the same output stream.</p>

<p>For non-locking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE fputc(), putc() and putchar() return the
character written as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF
on error.</p>

<p>puts() and fputs() return a non-negative number on
success, or EOF on error.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99.</p>

<p>BUGS It is not advisable to mix calls to output
functions from the stdio library with low-level calls to
write(2) for the file descriptor asso- ciated with the same
output stream; the results will be undefined and very
probably not what you want.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO write(2), ferror(3), fopen(3), fputwc(3),
fputws(3), fseek(3), fwrite(3), gets(3), putwchar(3),
scanf(3), unlocked_stdio(3)</p>
