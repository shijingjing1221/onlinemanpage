<p>NAME augenrules - a script that merges component audit
rule files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS augenrules [--check] [--load]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION augenrules is a script that merges all
component audit rules files, found in the audit rules
directory, /etc/audit/rules.d, placing the merged file in
/etc/audit/audit.rules. Component audit rule files, must end
in .rules in order to be processed. All other files in
/etc/audit/rules.d are ignored.</p>

<p>The files are concatenated in order, based on their
natural sort (see -v option of ls(1)) and stripped of empty
and comment (#) lines.</p>

<p>The last processed -D directive without an option, if
present, is always emitted as the first line in the
resultant file. Those with an option are replicated in
place. The last processed -b directive, if present, is
always emitted as the second line in the resultant file. The
last processed -f directive, if present, is always emitted
as the third line in the resultant file. The last processed
-e directive, if present, is always emitted as the last line
in the resultant file.</p>

<p>The generated file is only copied to
/etc/audit/audit.rules, if it dif- fers.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --check test if rules have changed and need
updating without overwriting audit.rules.</p>

<p>--load load old or newly built rules into the
kernel.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/audit/rules.d/ /etc/audit/audit.rules</p>

<p>SEE ALSO audit.rules(8), auditctl(8), auditd(8).</p>
