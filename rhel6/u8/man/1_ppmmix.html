<p>NAME ppmmix - blend together two PPM images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmmix fadefactor ppmfile1 ppmfile2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmmix reads two PPM images as input and mixes them
together using the specified fade factor. The fade factor
may be in the range from 0.0 (only ppmfile1s image data) to
1.0 (only ppmfile2 s image data). Any- thing in between
specifies a smooth blend between the two images.</p>

<p>The two images must have the same dimensions.</p>

<p>pamcomp is a more general alternative. It allows you to
mix images of different size and to have the fade factor
vary throughout the image (through the use of an alpha
mask).</p>
