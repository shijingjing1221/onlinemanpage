<p>TDBDUMP(8) System Administration tools TDBDUMP(8)</p>

<p>NAME tdbdump - tool for printing the contents of a TDB
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tdbdump [-k keyname] [-e] [-h] {filename}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(1) suite.</p>

<p>tdbdump is a very simple utility that
&acute;dumps&acute; the contents of a TDB (Trivial DataBase)
file to standard output in a human-readable format.</p>

<p>This tool can be used when debugging problems with TDB
files. It is intended for those who are somewhat familiar
with Samba internals.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Get help information.</p>

<p>-k keyname The -k option restricts dumping to a single
key, if found.</p>

<p>-e The -e tries to dump out from a corrupt database.
Naturally, such a dump is unreliable, at best.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The tdbdump man page was written by Jelmer Vernooij.</p>
