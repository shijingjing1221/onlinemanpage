<p>NAME ldns-notify - notify DNS servers that updates are
available</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ldns-notify [options] -z zone servers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ldns-notify sends a NOTIFY message to DNS
servers. This tells them that an updated zone is available
at the master servers. It can perform TSIG signatures and it
can add a SOA serial number of the updated zone. If a server
already has that serial number it will disregard the
message.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -z zone The zone that is updated.</p>

<p>-h Show usage and exit</p>

<p>-v Show the version and exit</p>

<p>-s serial Append a SOA record indicating the serial
number of the updated zone.</p>

<p>-p port Use port as destination port (default the DNS
port 53) for the UDP packets.</p>

<p>-y key:data Use the given TSIG key and base64-data to
sign the NOTIFY. Uses the hmac-md5 algorithm.</p>

<p>-d Print verbose debug information. The query that is
sent and the query that is received.</p>

<p>-r num Specify the maximum number of retries before
notify gives up trying to send the UDP packet.</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The program exits with a 0 exit code if all
servers replied an acknowl- edgement to the notify message,
and a failure exit code otherwise.</p>
