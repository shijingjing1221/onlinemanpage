<p>NAME usermount - A graphical tool to mount, unmount and
format filesystems.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS usermount [ options ]</p>

<p>userformat [ device ] [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION usermount is a graphical tool to allow users
to easily manage removable media, such as floppy disks or
zip disks. When the tool starts up, it scans /etc/fstab for
all filesystems that have been configured to allow users to
mount and unmount them. The filesystem can be mounted or
unmounted by pressing the toggle button labeled Mount.</p>

<p>Also, if the user has the appropriate permissions for
the device, the Format button will be active. This allows
the user to format disks using fdformat and create a new
filesystem of the type listed (using mkfs with the
appropriate option). Naturally, the user will be prompted
for confirmation before actually destroying data on the
device.</p>

<p>Note that if a device is already mounted, the format
button is inactive for all entries that share the same
device.</p>

<p>When run as root, usermount displays all of the entries
in /etc/fstab rather than just the ones with the user
option.</p>

<p>Invoking userformat device allows formatting device, as
if by selecting device in the userformat window, and by
clicking the Format button.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This program has no command line options of its
own, but it does take the standard X program options like
-display and such. See the X(1) man page for some of the
common options.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/fstab The system file describing the
mountable filesystems.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO mount(8), fdformat(8), mkfs(8), fstab(5)
X(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Mount entries with a filesystem type of iso9660 are
outright considered CD-ROMs and the format button is always
disabled.</p>

<p>Mount entries for swap files or partitions are also
ignored. A nice feature might be to allow root to turn swap
on and off for swap parti- tions.</p>
