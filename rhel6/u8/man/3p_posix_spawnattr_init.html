<p>POSIX_SPAWNATTR_DESTROY(3P)POSIX Programmer s
ManuaPOSIX_SPAWNATTR_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_spawnattr_destroy, posix_spawnattr_init -
destroy and initialize spawn attributes object (ADVANCED
REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;spawn.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_spawnattr_destroy(posix_spawnattr_t *attr);
int posix_spawnattr_init(posix_spawnattr_t *attr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_spawnattr_destroy() function shall
destroy a spawn attributes object. A destroyed attr
attributes object can be reinitialized using
posix_spawnattr_init(); the results of otherwise referencing
the object after it has been destroyed are undefined. An
implementation may cause posix_spawnattr_destroy() to set
the object referenced by attr to an invalid value.</p>

<p>The posix_spawnattr_init() function shall initialize a
spawn attributes object attr with the default value for all
of the individual attributes used by the implementation.
Results are undefined if posix_spaw- nattr_init() is called
specifying an already initialized attr attributes
object.</p>

<p>A spawn attributes object is of type posix_spawnattr_t
(defined in &lt;spawn.h&gt;) and is used to specify the
inheritance of process attributes across a spawn operation.
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not define compari- son or
assignment operators for the type posix_spawnattr_t.</p>

<p>Each implementation shall document the individual
attributes it uses and their default values unless these
values are defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Attributes not
defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, their default values, and
the names of the associated functions to get and set those
attribute values are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The resulting spawn attributes object (possibly modified
by setting individual attribute values), is used to modify
the behavior of posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp(). After a
spawn attributes object has been used to spawn a process by
a call to a posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp(), any function
affecting the attributes object (including destruction)
shall not affect any process that has been spawned in this
way.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
posix_spawnattr_destroy() and posix_spaw- nattr_init() shall
return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_spawnattr_init() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
spawn attributes object.</p>

<p>The posix_spawnattr_destroy() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE These functions are part of the Spawn
option and need not be provided on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The original spawn interface proposed in IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 defined the attributes that specify the
inheritance of process attributes across a spawn operation
as a structure. In order to be able to sepa- rate optional
individual attributes under their appropriate options (that
is, the spawn-schedparam and spawn-schedpolicy attributes
depend- ing upon the Process Scheduling option), and also
for extensibility and consistency with the newer POSIX
interfaces, the attributes interface has been changed to an
opaque data type. This interface now consists of the type
posix_spawnattr_t, representing a spawn attributes object,
together with associated functions to initialize or destroy
the attributes object, and to set or get each individual
attribute. Although the new object-oriented interface is
more verbose than the original structure, it is simple to
use, more extensible, and easy to implement.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
