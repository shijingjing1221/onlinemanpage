<p>PRINTF(3) Linux Programmer s Manual PRINTF(3)</p>

<p>NAME printf, fprintf, sprintf, snprintf, vprintf,
vfprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf - formatted output
conversion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int printf(const char *format, ...); int fprintf(FILE
*stream, const char *format, ...); int sprintf(char *str,
const char *format, ...); int snprintf(char *str, size_t
size, const char *format, ...);</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</p>

<p>int vprintf(const char *format, va_list ap); int
vfprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, va_list ap); int
vsprintf(char *str, const char *format, va_list ap); int
vsnprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format,
va_list ap);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>snprintf(), vsnprintf(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
&gt;= 500 || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or cc -std=c99</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The functions in the printf() family produce
output according to a for- mat as described below. The
functions printf() and vprintf() write output to stdout, the
standard output stream; fprintf() and vfprintf() write
output to the given output stream; sprintf(), snprintf(),
vsprintf() and vsnprintf() write to the character string
str.</p>

<p>The functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() write at most
size bytes (including the trailing null byte (&rsquo;
&rsquo;)) to str.</p>

<p>The functions vprintf(), vfprintf(), vsprintf(),
vsnprintf() are equiv- alent to the functions printf(),
fprintf(), sprintf(), snprintf(), respectively, except that
they are called with a va_list instead of a variable number
of arguments. These functions do not call the va_end macro.
Because they invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap is
unde- fined after the call. See stdarg(3).</p>

<p>These eight functions write the output under the control
of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments
(or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument
facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.</p>

<p>C99 and POSIX.1-2001 specify that the results are
undefined if a call to sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf(), or
vsnprintf() would cause to copying to take place between
objects that overlap (e.g., if the target string array and
one of the supplied input arguments refer to the same
buffer). See NOTES.</p>

<p>Return value Upon successful return, these functions
return the number of characters printed (not including the
trailing &rsquo; &rsquo; used to end output to strings).</p>

<p>The functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() do not write
more than size bytes (including the trailing &rsquo;
&rsquo;). If the output was truncated due to this limit then
the return value is the number of characters (not including
the trailing &rsquo; &rsquo;) which would have been written
to the final string if enough space had been available.
Thus, a return value of size or more means that the output
was truncated. (See also below under NOTES.)</p>

<p>If an output error is encountered, a negative value is
returned.</p>

<p>Format of the format string The format string is a
character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift
state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more
directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied
unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or
more subsequent arguments. Each con- version specification
is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
specifier. In between there may be (in this order) zero or
more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional
precision and an optional length modifier.</p>

<p>The arguments must correspond properly (after type
promotion) with the conversion specifier. By default, the
arguments are used in the order given, where each
&rsquo;*&rsquo; and each conversion specifier asks for the
next argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many
arguments are given). One can also specify explicitly which
argument is taken, at each place where an argument is
required, by writing &quot;%m$&quot; instead of
&rsquo;%&rsquo; and &quot;*m$&quot; instead of
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, where the decimal integer m denotes the
position in the argument list of the desired argument,
indexed starting from 1. Thus,</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%*d&quot;, width, num);</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%2$*1$d&quot;, width, num);</p>

<p>are equivalent. The second style allows repeated
references to the same argument. The C99 standard does not
include the style using &rsquo;$&rsquo;, which comes from
the Single Unix Specification. If the style using
&rsquo;$&rsquo; is used, it must be used throughout for all
conversions taking an argu- ment and all width and precision
arguments, but it may be mixed with &quot;%%&quot; formats
which do not consume an argument. There may be no gaps in
the numbers of arguments specified using &rsquo;$&rsquo;;
for example, if arguments 1 and 3 are specified, argument 2
must also be specified somewhere in the format string.</p>

<p>For some numeric conversions a radix character
(&quot;decimal point&quot;) or thousands grouping character
is used. The actual character used depends on the LC_NUMERIC
part of the locale. The POSIX locale uses &rsquo;.&rsquo; as
radix character, and does not have a grouping character.
Thus,</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%&rsquo;.2f&quot;, 1234567.89);</p>

<p>results in &quot;1234567.89&quot; in the POSIX locale,
in &quot;1234567,89&quot; in the nl_NL locale, and in
&quot;1.234.567,89&quot; in the da_DK locale.</p>

<p>The flag characters The character % is followed by zero
or more of the following flags:</p>

<p># The value should be converted to an &quot;alternate
form&quot;. For o conversions, the first character of the
output string is made zero (by prefixing a 0 if it was not
zero already). For x and X conversions, a non-zero result
has the string &quot;0x&quot; (or &quot;0X&quot; for X
conversions) prepended to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G
conversions, the result will always contain a decimal point,
even if no digits follow it (normally, a decimal point
appears in the results of those conversions only if a digit
follows). For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not
removed from the result as they would otherwise be. For
other conversions, the result is undefined.</p>

<p>0 The value should be zero padded. For d, i, o, u, x, X,
a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, the converted value
is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks. If the
0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is ignored. If a
precision is given with a numeric conversion (d, i, o, u, x,
and X), the 0 flag is ignored. For other conversions, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>- The converted value is to be left adjusted on the
field bound- ary. (The default is right justification.)
Except for n con- versions, the converted value is padded on
the right with blanks, rather than on the left with blanks
or zeros. A - over- rides a 0 if both are given.</p>

<p>&rsquo; &rsquo; (a space) A blank should be left before
a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed
conversion.</p>

<p>+ A sign (+ or -) should always be placed before a
number produced by a signed conversion. By default a sign is
used only for neg- ative numbers. A + overrides a space if
both are used.</p>

<p>The five flag characters above are defined in the C
standard. The SUSv2 specifies one further flag
character.</p>

<p>&rsquo; For decimal conversion (i, d, u, f, F, g, G) the
output is to be grouped with thousands grouping characters
if the locale infor- mation indicates any. Note that many
versions of gcc(1) cannot parse this option and will issue a
warning. SUSv2 does not include %&rsquo;F.</p>

<p>glibc 2.2 adds one further flag character.</p>

<p>I For decimal integer conversion (i, d, u) the output
uses the locale s alternative output digits, if any. For
example, since glibc 2.2.3 this will give Arabic-Indic
digits in the Persian (&quot;fa_IR&quot;) locale.</p>

<p>The field width An optional decimal digit string (with
non-zero first digit) specifying a minimum field width. If
the converted value has fewer characters than the field
width, it will be padded with spaces on the left (or right,
if the left-adjustment flag has been given). Instead of a
deci- mal digit string one may write &quot;*&quot; or
&quot;*m$&quot; (for some decimal integer m) to specify that
the field width is given in the next argument, or in the
m-th argument, respectively, which must be of type int. A
negative field width is taken as a &rsquo;-&rsquo; flag
followed by a positive field width. In no case does a
nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a
field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field
width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion
result.</p>

<p>The precision An optional precision, in the form of a
period (&rsquo;.&rsquo;) followed by an optional decimal
digit string. Instead of a decimal digit string one may
write &quot;*&quot; or &quot;*m$&quot; (for some decimal
integer m) to specify that the precision is given in the
next argument, or in the m-th argument, respectively, which
must be of type int. If the precision is given as just
&rsquo;.&rsquo;, or the precision is negative, the precision
is taken to be zero. This gives the minimum number of digits
to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, the number
of digits to appear after the radix character for a, A, e,
E, f, and F conversions, the maximum number of significant
digits for g and G conversions, or the maximum number of
characters to be printed from a string for s and S
conversions.</p>

<p>The length modifier Here, &quot;integer conversion&quot;
stands for d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion.</p>

<p>hh A following integer conversion corresponds to a
signed char or unsigned char argument, or a following n
conversion corresponds to a pointer to a signed char
argument.</p>

<p>h A following integer conversion corresponds to a short
int or unsigned short int argument, or a following n
conversion corre- sponds to a pointer to a short int
argument.</p>

<p>l (ell) A following integer conversion corresponds to a
long int or unsigned long int argument, or a following n
conversion cor- responds to a pointer to a long int
argument, or a following c conversion corresponds to a
wint_t argument, or a following s conversion corresponds to
a pointer to wchar_t argument.</p>

<p>ll (ell-ell). A following integer conversion corresponds
to a long long int or unsigned long long int argument, or a
following n conversion corresponds to a pointer to a long
long int argument.</p>

<p>L A following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion
corresponds to a long double argument. (C99 allows %LF, but
SUSv2 does not.)</p>

<p>q (&quot;quad&quot;. 4.4BSD and Linux libc5 only. Dont
use.) This is a synonym for ll.</p>

<p>j A following integer conversion corresponds to an
intmax_t or uintmax_t argument.</p>

<p>z A following integer conversion corresponds to a size_t
or ssize_t argument. (Linux libc5 has Z with this meaning.
Dont use it.)</p>

<p>t A following integer conversion corresponds to a
ptrdiff_t argu- ment.</p>

<p>The SUSv2 only knows about the length modifiers h (in
hd, hi, ho, hx, hX, hn) and l (in ld, li, lo, lx, lX, ln,
lc, ls) and L (in Le, LE, Lf, Lg, LG).</p>

<p>The conversion specifier A character that specifies the
type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers
and their meanings are:</p>

<p>d, i The int argument is converted to signed decimal
notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of
digits that must appear; if the converted value requires
fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The
default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit
precision 0, the output is empty.</p>

<p>o, u, x, X The unsigned int argument is converted to
unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned
hexadecimal (x and X) nota- tion. The letters abcdef are
used for x conversions; the let- ters ABCDEF are used for X
conversions. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number
of digits that must appear; if the con- verted value
requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an
explicit precision 0, the output is empty.</p>

<p>e, E The double argument is rounded and converted in the
style [-]d.ddde&plusmn;dd where there is one digit before
the decimal-point character and the number of digits after
it is equal to the pre- cision; if the precision is missing,
it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero, no decimal-point
character appears. An E conversion uses the letter E (rather
than e) to introduce the exponent. The exponent always
contains at least two digits; if the value is zero, the
exponent is 00.</p>

<p>f, F The double argument is rounded and converted to
decimal notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number
of digits after the decimal-point character is equal to the
precision specification. If the precision is missing, it is
taken as 6; if the precision is explicitly zero, no
decimal-point character appears. If a decimal point appears,
at least one digit appears before it.</p>

<p>(The SUSv2 does not know about F and says that character
string representations for infinity and NaN may be made
available. The C99 standard specifies &quot;[-]inf&quot; or
&quot;[-]infinity&quot; for infinity, and a string starting
with &quot;nan&quot; for NaN, in the case of f con- version,
and &quot;[-]INF&quot; or &quot;[-]INFINITY&quot; or
&quot;NAN*&quot; in the case of F conversion.)</p>

<p>g, G The double argument is converted in style f or e
(or F or E for G conversions). The precision specifies the
number of signifi- cant digits. If the precision is missing,
6 digits are given; if the precision is zero, it is treated
as 1. Style e is used if the exponent from its conversion is
less than -4 or greater than or equal to the precision.
Trailing zeros are removed from the fractional part of the
result; a decimal point appears only if it is followed by at
least one digit.</p>

<p>a, A (C99; not in SUSv2) For a conversion, the double
argument is converted to hexadecimal notation (using the
letters abcdef) in the style [-]0xh.hhhhp&plusmn;d; for A
conversion the prefix 0X, the letters ABCDEF, and the
exponent separator P is used. There is one hexadecimal digit
before the decimal point, and the number of digits after it
is equal to the precision. The default pre- cision suffices
for an exact representation of the value if an exact
representation in base 2 exists and otherwise is suffi-
ciently large to distinguish values of type double. The
digit before the decimal point is unspecified for
non-normalized num- bers, and non-zero but otherwise
unspecified for normalized num- bers.</p>

<p>c If no l modifier is present, the int argument is
converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character
is written. If an l modifier is present, the wint_t (wide
character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by
a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state
starting in the initial state, and the resulting multibyte
string is written.</p>

<p>s If no l modifier is present: The const char * argument
is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type
(pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written
up to (but not including) a terminating null byte (&rsquo;
&rsquo;); if a precision is specified, no more than the
number specified are written. If a precision is given, no
null byte need be present; if the preci- sion is not
specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the
array must contain a terminating null byte.</p>

<p>If an l modifier is present: The const wchar_t *
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of wide
characters. Wide characters from the array are converted to
multibyte characters (each by a call to the wcrtomb(3)
function, with a conversion state starting in the initial
state before the first wide char- acter), up to and
including a terminating null wide character. The resulting
multibyte characters are written up to (but not including)
the terminating null byte. If a precision is speci- fied, no
more bytes than the number specified are written, but no
partial multibyte characters are written. Note that the pre-
cision determines the number of bytes written, not the
number of wide characters or screen positions. The array
must contain a terminating null wide character, unless a
precision is given and it is so small that the number of
bytes written exceeds it before the end of the array is
reached.</p>

<p>C (Not in C99, but in SUSv2.) Synonym for lc. Dont
use.</p>

<p>S (Not in C99, but in SUSv2.) Synonym for ls. Don t
use.</p>

<p>p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal
(as if by %#x or %#lx).</p>

<p>n The number of characters written so far is stored into
the inte- ger indicated by the int * (or variant) pointer
argument. No argument is converted.</p>

<p>m (Glibc extension.) Print output of strerror(errno). No
argu- ment is required.</p>

<p>% A &rsquo;%&rsquo; is written. No argument is
converted. The complete con- version specification is
&rsquo;%%&rsquo;.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The fprintf(), printf(), sprintf(),
vprintf(), vfprintf(), and vsprintf() functions conform to
C89 and C99. The snprintf() and vsnprintf() functions
conform to C99.</p>

<p>Concerning the return value of snprintf(), SUSv2 and C99
contradict each other: when snprintf() is called with size=0
then SUSv2 stipulates an unspecified return value less than
1, while C99 allows str to be NULL in this case, and gives
the return value (as always) as the number of characters
that would have been written in case the output string has
been large enough.</p>

<p>Linux libc4 knows about the five C standard flags. It
knows about the length modifiers h, l, L, and the
conversions c, d, e, E, f, F, g, G, i, n, o, p, s, u, x, and
X, where F is a synonym for f. Additionally, it accepts D,
O, and U as synonyms for ld, lo, and lu. (This is bad, and
caused serious bugs later, when support for %D disappeared.)
No locale-dependent radix character, no thousands separator,
no NaN or infinity, no &quot;%m$&quot; and
&quot;*m$&quot;.</p>

<p>Linux libc5 knows about the five C standard flags and
the &rsquo; flag, locale, &quot;%m$&quot; and
&quot;*m$&quot;. It knows about the length modifiers h, l,
L, Z, and q, but accepts L and q both for long double and
for long long int (this is a bug). It no longer recognizes
F, D, O, and U, but adds the conversion character m, which
outputs strerror(errno).</p>

<p>glibc 2.0 adds conversion characters C and S.</p>

<p>glibc 2.1 adds length modifiers hh, j, t, and z and
conversion charac- ters a and A.</p>

<p>glibc 2.2 adds the conversion character F with C99
semantics, and the flag character I.</p>

<p>NOTES Some programs imprudently rely on code such as the
following</p>

<p>sprintf(buf, &quot;%s some further text&quot;, buf);</p>

<p>to append text to buf. However, the standards explicitly
note that the results are undefined if source and
destination buffers overlap when calling sprintf(),
snprintf(), vsprintf(), and vsnprintf(). Depending on the
version of gcc(1) used, and the compiler options employed,
calls such as the above will not produce the expected
results.</p>

<p>The glibc implementation of the functions snprintf() and
vsnprintf() conforms to the C99 standard, that is, behaves
as described above, since glibc version 2.1. Until glibc
2.0.6 they would return -1 when the output was
truncated.</p>

<p>BUGS Because sprintf() and vsprintf() assume an
arbitrarily long string, callers must be careful not to
overflow the actual space; this is often impossible to
assure. Note that the length of the strings produced is
locale-dependent and difficult to predict. Use snprintf()
and vsnprintf() instead (or asprintf(3) and
vasprintf(3)).</p>

<p>Linux libc4.[45] does not have a snprintf(), but
provides a libbsd that contains an snprintf() equivalent to
sprintf(), that is, one that ignores the size argument.
Thus, the use of snprintf() with early libc4 leads to
serious security problems.</p>

<p>Code such as printf(foo); often indicates a bug, since
foo may contain a % character. If foo comes from untrusted
user input, it may contain %n, causing the printf() call to
write to memory and creating a secu- rity hole.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE To print pi to five decimal places:</p>

<p>#include &lt;math.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
fprintf(stdout, &quot;pi = %.5f0, 4 * atan(1.0));</p>

<p>To print a date and time in the form &quot;Sunday, July
3, 10:02&quot;, where weekday and month are pointers to
strings:</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; fprintf(stdout, &quot;%s, %s
%d, %.2d:%.2d0, weekday, month, day, hour, min);</p>

<p>Many countries use the day-month-year order. Hence, an
international- ized version must be able to print the
arguments in an order specified by the format:</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; fprintf(stdout, format,
weekday, month, day, hour, min);</p>

<p>where format depends on locale, and may permute the
arguments. With the value:</p>

<p>&quot;%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2d0</p>

<p>one might obtain &quot;Sonntag, 3. Juli,
10:02&quot;.</p>

<p>To allocate a sufficiently large string and print into
it (code correct for both glibc 2.0 and glibc 2.1):</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</p>

<p>char * make_message(const char *fmt, ...) { /* Guess we
need no more than 100 bytes. */ int n, size = 100; char *p,
*np; va_list ap;</p>

<p>if ((p = malloc(size)) == NULL) return NULL;</p>

<p>while (1) { /* Try to print in the allocated space. */
va_start(ap, fmt); n = vsnprintf(p, size, fmt, ap);
va_end(ap); /* If that worked, return the string. */ if (n
&gt; -1 &amp;&amp; n &lt; size) return p; /* Else try again
with more space. */ if (n &gt; -1) /* glibc 2.1 */ size =
n+1; /* precisely what is needed */ else /* glibc 2.0 */
size *= 2; /* twice the old size */ if ((np = realloc (p,
size)) == NULL) { free(p); return NULL; } else { p = np; } }
}</p>
