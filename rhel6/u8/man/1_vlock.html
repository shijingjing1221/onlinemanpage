<p>VLOCK(1) VLOCK(1)</p>

<p>NAME vlock - Virtual Console lock program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vlock</p>

<p>vlock [ -a,--all ] [ -c,--current ] [ -h,--help ] [
-v,--version ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vlock is a program to lock one or more
sessions on the Linux console. This is especially useful for
Linux machines which have multiple users with access to the
console. One user may lock his or her session(s) while still
allowing other users to use the system on other virtual
consoles. If desired, the entire console may be locked and
virtual console switching disabled.</p>

<p>By default, only the current VC (virtual console) is
locked. With the -a,-all option all VCs are locked. The
locked VCs cannot be unlocked without the invokers password
or the root password. The root password will always be able
to unlock any or all sessions. And, for the para- noid,
vlock makes it a trying experience for those attempting to
guess the password, so unauthorized access to session(s) is
highly unlikely.</p>

<p>Please note that it is entirely possible to completely
lock yourself out of the console with the -a,--all option if
you cannot remember your password! Unless you are able to
kill vlock by logging in remotely via a serial terminal or
network, a hard reset is the only method of unlocking the
display.</p>

<p>vlock works for console sessions primarily. However,
there is support for trying to lock non-console sessions as
well, but that support has not been well tested.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a,--all</p>

<p>Lock all console sessions and disable VC switching.</p>

<p>-c,--current</p>

<p>Lock the current session (this is the default).</p>

<p>-h,--help</p>

<p>Print a brief help message.</p>

<p>-v,--version</p>

<p>Print the version number of vlock.</p>
