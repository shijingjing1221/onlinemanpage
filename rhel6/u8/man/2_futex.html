<p>NAME futex - Fast Userspace Locking system call</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/futex.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int futex(int *uaddr, int op, int val, const struct
timespec *timeout, int *uaddr2, int val3);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The futex() system call provides a method
for a program to wait for a value at a given address to
change, and a method to wake up anyone waiting on a
particular address (while the addresses for the same mem-
ory in separate processes may not be equal, the kernel maps
them inter- nally so the same memory mapped in different
locations will correspond for futex() calls). It is
typically used to implement the contended case of a lock in
shared memory, as described in futex(7).</p>

<p>When a futex(7) operation did not finish uncontended in
userspace, a call needs to be made to the kernel to
arbitrate. Arbitration can either mean putting the calling
process to sleep or, conversely, waking a waiting
process.</p>

<p>Callers of this function are expected to adhere to the
semantics as set out in futex(7). As these semantics involve
writing non-portable assembly instructions, this in turn
probably means that most users will in fact be library
authors and not general application developers.</p>

<p>The uaddr argument needs to point to an aligned integer
which stores the counter. The operation to execute is passed
via the op argument, along with a value val.</p>

<p>Five operations are currently defined:</p>

<p>FUTEX_WAIT This operation atomically verifies that the
futex address uaddr still contains the value val, and sleeps
awaiting FUTEX_WAKE on this futex address. If the timeout
argument is non-NULL, its contents describe the maximum
duration of the wait, which is infinite otherwise. The
arguments uaddr2 and val3 are ignored.</p>

<p>For futex(7), this call is executed if decrementing the
count gave a negative value (indicating contention), and
will sleep until another process releases the futex and
executes the FUTEX_WAKE operation.</p>

<p>FUTEX_WAKE This operation wakes at most val processes
waiting on this futex address (i.e., inside FUTEX_WAIT). The
arguments timeout, uaddr2 and val3 are ignored.</p>

<p>For futex(7), this is executed if incrementing the count
showed that there were waiters, once the futex value has
been set to 1 (indicating that it is available).</p>

<p>FUTEX_FD (present up to and including Linux 2.6.25) To
support asynchronous wakeups, this operation associates a
file descriptor with a futex. If another process executes a
FUTEX_WAKE, the process will receive the signal number that
was passed in val. The calling process must close the
returned file descriptor after use. The arguments timeout,
uaddr2 and val3 are ignored.</p>

<p>To prevent race conditions, the caller should test if
the futex has been upped after FUTEX_FD returns.</p>

<p>Because it was inherently racy, FUTEX_FD has been
removed from Linux 2.6.26 onwards.</p>

<p>FUTEX_REQUEUE (since Linux 2.5.70) This operation was
introduced in order to avoid a &quot;thundering herd&quot;
effect when FUTEX_WAKE is used and all processes woken up
need to acquire another futex. This call wakes up val pro-
cesses, and requeues all other waiters on the futex at
address uaddr2. The arguments timeout and val3 are
ignored.</p>

<p>FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE (since Linux 2.6.7) There was a race
in the intended use of FUTEX_REQUEUE, so FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE
was introduced. This is similar to FUTEX_REQUEUE, but first
checks whether the location uaddr still contains the value
val3. If not, the operation fails with the error EAGAIN. The
argument timeout is ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Depending on which operation was executed,
the returned value for a successful call can have differing
meanings.</p>

<p>FUTEX_WAIT Returns 0 if the process was woken by a
FUTEX_WAKE call. In case of timeout, the operation fails
with the error ETIMEDOUT. If the futex was not equal to the
expected value, the operation fails with the error
EWOULDBLOCK. Signals (see signal(7)) or other spurious
wakeups cause FUTEX_WAIT to fail with the error EINTR.</p>

<p>FUTEX_WAKE Returns the number of processes woken up.</p>

<p>FUTEX_FD Returns the new file descriptor associated with
the futex.</p>

<p>FUTEX_REQUEUE Returns the number of processes woken
up.</p>

<p>FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE Returns the number of processes woken
up.</p>

<p>In the event of an error, all operations return -1, and
set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES No read access to futex memory.</p>

<p>EAGAIN FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE found an unexpected futex
value. (This proba- bly indicates a race; use the safe
FUTEX_WAKE now.)</p>

<p>EFAULT Error in getting timeout information from
userspace.</p>

<p>EINVAL An operation was not defined or error in page
alignment.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOSYS Invalid operation specified in op.</p>

<p>VERSIONS Initial futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7
but with different semantics from what was described above.
A 4-argument system call with the semantics given here was
introduced in Linux 2.5.40. In Linux 2.5.70 one argument was
added. In Linux 2.6.7 a sixth argument was added messy,
especially on the s390 architecture.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES To reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an
easy-to-use abstrac- tion for end-users. (There is no
wrapper function for this system call in glibc.)
Implementors are expected to be assembly literate and to
have read the sources of the futex userspace library
referenced below.</p>
