<p>NAME lvresize resize a logical volume</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvresize [--alloc AllocationPolicy]
[--noudevsync] [--commandprofile ProfileName] [-i|--stripes
Stripes [-I|--stripesize StripeSize]] {[-l|--extents
[+|-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}] |
[-L|--size [+|-]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]}
[--poolmetadata- size [+]MetadataVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgG]
[-f|--force] [-n|--nofsck] [-r|--resizefs]
LogicalVolume{Name|Path} [PhysicalVol-
umePath[:PE[-PE]]...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvresize allows you to resize a logical
volume. Be careful when reduc- ing a logical volume s size,
because data in the reduced part is lost!!! You should
therefore ensure that any filesystem on the volume is shrunk
first so that the extents that are to be removed are not in
use. Resizing snapshot logical volumes (see lvcreate(8) for
informa- tion about creating snapshots) is supported as
well. But to change the number of copies in a mirrored
logical volume use lvconvert(8).</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force resize without prompting even when it
may cause data loss.</p>

<p>-n, --nofsck Do not perform fsck before resizing
filesystem when filesystem requires it. You may need to use
--force to proceed with this option.</p>

<p>-r, --resizefs Resize underlying filesystem together
with the logical volume using fsadm(8).</p>

<p>-l, --extents
[+|-]LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|LV|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}] Change
or set the logical volume size in units of logical extents.
With the + or - sign the value is added to or sub- tracted
from the actual size of the logical volume and without it,
the value is taken as an absolute one. The total number of
physical extents affected will be greater than this if, for
example, the volume is mirrored. The number can also be
expressed as a percentage of the total space in the Volume
Group with the suffix %VG, relative to the existing size of
the Logi- cal Volume with the suffix %LV, as a percentage of
the remaining free space of the PhysicalVolumes on the
command line with the suffix %PVS, as a percentage of the
remaining free space in the Volume Group with the suffix
%FREE, or (for a snapshot) as a percentage of the total
space in the Origin Logical Volume with the suffix %ORIGIN.
The resulting value is rounded downward for the subtraction
otherwise it is rounded upward. N.B. In a future release,
when expressed as a percentage with PVS, VG or FREE, the
number will be treated as an approximate total number of
physical extents to be allocated or freed (including extents
used by any mirrors, for example). The code may currently
allo- cate or remove more space than you might otherwise
expect.</p>

<p>-L, --size [+|-]LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]
Change or set the logical volume size in units of megabytes.
A size suffix of M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, T for
ter- abytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional.
With the + or - sign the value is added or subtracted from
the actual size of the logical volume and rounded to the
full extent size and without it, the value is taken as an
absolute one.</p>

<p>-i, --stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes to use
when extending a Logical Vol- ume. Defaults to whatever the
last segment of the Logical Vol- ume uses. Not applicable to
LVs using the original metadata LVM format, which must use a
single value throughout.</p>

<p>--poolmetadatasize [+]MetadataVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgG]
Change or set the thin pool metadata logical volume size.
With the + sign the value is added to the actual size of the
metadata volume and rounded to the full extent size and
without it, the value is taken as an absolute one. Maximal
size is 16GiB. Default unit is megabytes.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. Defaults to
whatever the last segment of the Logical Volume uses. Not
applicable to LVs using the original metadata LVM format,
which must use a single value throughout. StripeSize must be
2^n (n = 2 to 9) for metadata in LVM1 format. For metadata
in LVM2 format, the stripe size may be a larger power of 2
but must not exceed the physical extent size.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Extend a logical volume vg1/lv1 by 16MB using
physical extents /dev/sda:0-1 and /dev/sdb:0-1 for
allocation of extents:</p>

<p>lvresize -L+16M vg1/lv1 /dev/sda:0-1 /dev/sdb:0-1</p>
