<p>NAME radiusd - Authentication, Authorization and
Accounting server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS radiusd [-C] [-d config_directory] [-f] [-h]
[-i ip-address] [-l log_file] [-m] [-n name] [-p port] [-s]
[-t] [-v] [-x] [-X]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly
configurable RADIUS server. It supports many database
back-ends such as flat-text files, SQL, LDAP, Perl, Python,
etc. It also supports many authentication protocols such as
PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP(v2), HTTP Digest, and EAP (EAP-MD5,
EAP-TLS, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM, etc.).</p>

<p>It also has fullsupport for Ciscos VLAN Query Protocol
(VMPS) and DHCP.</p>

<p>Please read the DEBUGGING section below. It contains
instructions for quickly configuring the server for your
local system.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following command-line options are accepted
by the server:</p>

<p>-C Check the configuration and exit immediately. If
there is a problem reading the configuration, then the
server will exit with a non-zero status code. If the
configuration appears to be acceptable, then the server will
exit with a zero status code.</p>

<p>Note that there are limitations to this check. Due to
the com- plexities involved in almost starting a RADIUS
server, these checks are necessarily incomplete. The server
can return a zero status code when run with -C, but may
still exit with an error when run normally.</p>

<p>See the output of radiusd -XC for an informative list of
which modules are checked for correct configuration, and
which modules are skipped, and therefore not checked.</p>

<p>-d config directory Defaults to /etc/raddb. Radiusd
looks here for its configuration files such as the
dictionary and the users files.</p>

<p>-f Do not fork, stay running as a foreground
process.</p>

<p>-h Print usage help information.</p>

<p>-i ip-address Defines which IP address that the server
uses for sending and receiving packets.</p>

<p>If this command-line option is given, then the
&quot;bind_address&quot; and all &quot;listen{}&quot;
entries in radiusd.conf are ignored.</p>

<p>This option MUST be used in conjunction with
&quot;-p&quot;.</p>

<p>-l log_file Defaults to ${logdir}/radius.log. Radiusd
writes its logging information to this file. If log_file is
the string &quot;stdout&quot; logging will be written to
stdout.</p>

<p>-m On SIGINT or SIGQUIT exit cleanly instead of
immediately. This is most useful for when running the server
with &quot;valgrind&quot;.</p>

<p>-n name Read raddb/name.conf instead of
raddb/radiusd.conf.</p>

<p>-p port Defines which port is used for receiving
authentication packets. Accounting packets are received on
&quot;port + 1&quot;.</p>

<p>When this command-line option is given, all
&quot;listen&quot; sections in radiusd.conf are ignored.</p>

<p>This option MUST be used in conjunction with
&quot;-i&quot;.</p>

<p>-s Run in &quot;single server&quot; mode. The server
normally runs with mul- tiple threads and/or processes,
which can lower its response time to requests. Some systems
have issues with threading, how- ever, so running in
&quot;single server&quot; mode may help to address those
issues. In single server mode, the server will also not
&quot;daemonize&quot; (auto-background) itself.</p>

<p>-t Do not spawn threads.</p>

<p>-v Print server version information and exit.</p>

<p>-X Debugging mode. Equivalent to &quot;-sfxx -l
stdout&quot;. When trying to understand how the server
works, ALWAYS run it with &quot;radiusd -X&quot;. For
production servers, use &quot;raddebug&quot;</p>

<p>-x Finer-grained debug mode. In this mode the server
will print details of every request on its stdout output.
You can specify this option multiple times (-x -x or -xx) to
get more detailed output.</p>

<p>DEBUGGING The default configuration is set to work in
the widest possible circum- stances. It requires minimal
changes for your system.</p>

<p>However, your needs may be complex, and may require
significant changes to the server configuration. Making
random changes is a guaranteed method of failure. Instead,
we STRONGLY RECOMMEND proceeding via the following
steps:</p>

<p>1) Always run the server in debugging mode ( radiusd -X
) after making a configuration change. We cannot emphasize
this enough. If you are not running the server in debugging
mode, you will not be able to see what is doing, and you
will not be able to correct any problems.</p>

<p>If you ask questions on the mailing list, the first
response will be to tell you &quot;run the server in
debugging mode&quot;. Please, follow these instructions.</p>

<p>2) Change as little as possible in the default
configuration files. The server contains a decade of
experience with protocols, databases, and different systems.
Its default configuration is designed to work almost
everywhere, and to do almost everything you need.</p>

<p>3) When you make a small change, testing it before
changing anything else. If the change works, save a copy of
the configuration, and make another change. If the change
doesnt work, debug it, and try to understand why it doesnt
work.</p>

<p>If you begin by making large changes to the server
configuration, it will never work, and you will never be
able to debug the problem.</p>

<p>4) If you need to add a connection to a database FOO
(e.g. LDAP or SQL), then:</p>

<p>a) Edit raddb/modules/foo This file contains the default
configuration for the module. It contains comments
describing what can be configured, and what those
configuration entries mean. b) Edit
raddb/sites-available/default This file contains the default
policy for the server. e.g. &quot;enable CHAP, MS-CHAP, and
EAP authentication&quot;. Look in this file for all
references to your module &quot;foo&quot;. Read the
comments, and remove the leading hash # from the lines
referencing the module. This enables the module. c) Edit
raddb/sites-available/inner-tunnel This file contains the
default policy for the &quot;tunneled&quot; portion of
certain EAP methods. Perform the same kind of edits as
above, for the &quot;default&quot; file.. If you are not
using EAP (802.1X), then this step can be skipped. d) Start
the server in debugging mode ( radiusd -X ), and start
testing.</p>

<p>5) Ask questions on the mailing list
(freeradius-users@lists.freera- dius.org). When asking
questions, include the output from debugging mode ( radiusd
-X ). This information will allow people to help you. If you
do not include it, the first response to your message will
be &quot;post the output of debug mode&quot;.</p>

<p>Ask questions earlier, rather than later. If you cannot
solve a prob- lem in a day, ask a question on the mailing
list. Most questions have been seen before, and can be
answered quickly.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND RADIUS is a protocol spoken between an access
server, typically a device connected to several modems or
ISDN lines, and a radius server. When a user connects to the
access server, (s)he is asked for a login- name and a
password. This information is then sent to the radius
server. The server replies with &quot;access denied&quot;,
or &quot;access OK&quot;. In the latter case login
information is sent along, such as the IP address in the
case of a PPP connection.</p>

<p>The access server also sends login and logout records to
the radius server so accounting can be done. These records
are kept for each ter- minal server seperately in a file
called detail, and in the wtmp com- patible logfile
/var/log/radwtmp.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION Radiusd uses a number of configuration
files. Each file has its own manpage describing the format
of the file. These files are:</p>

<p>radiusd.conf The main configuration file, which sets the
administrator-con- trolled items.</p>

<p>dictionary This file is usually static. It defines all
the possible RADIUS attributes used in the other
configuration files. You dont have to modify it. It includes
other dictionary files in the same directory.</p>

<p>hints Defines certain hints to the radius server based
on the userss loginname or other attributes sent by the
access server. It also provides for mapping user names (such
as Pusername -&gt; username). This provides the
functionality that the Livingston 2.0 server has as
&quot;Prefix&quot; and &quot;Suffix&quot; support in the
users file, but is more general. Ofcourse the Livingston way
of doing things is also supported, and you can even use both
at the same time (within certain limits).</p>

<p>huntgroups Defines the huntgroups that you have, and
makes it possible to restrict access to certain huntgroups
to certain (groups of) users.</p>

<p>users Here the users are defined. On a typical setup,
this file mainly contains DEFAULT entries to process the
different types of logins, based on hints from the hints
file. Authentication is then based on the contents of the
UNIX /etc/passwd file. However it is also possible to define
all users, and their passwords, in this file.</p>
