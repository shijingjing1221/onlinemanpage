<p>TEX(1) TEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME tex, virtex, initex - text formatting and
typesetting</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tex [options] [&amp; format ] [ file | commands
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run the TeX typesetter on file, usually
creating file.dvi. If the file argument has no extension,
&quot;.tex&quot; will be appended to it. Instead of a
filename, a set of TeX commands can be given, the first of
which must start with a backslash. With a &amp;format
argument TeX uses a different set of precompiled commands,
contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to use the
-fmt format option instead.</p>

<p>TeX formats the interspersed text and commands contained
in the named files and outputs a typesetter independent file
(called DVI, which is short for DeVice Independent). TeXs
capabilities and language are described in The TeX for
nroffbook. TeX is normally used with a large body of
precompiled macros, and there are several specific
formatting systems, such as LaTeX, which require the support
of several macro files.</p>

<p>This version of TeX looks at its command line to see
what name it was called under. If they exist, then both
initex and virtex are symbolic links to the tex executable.
When called as initex (or when the -ini option is given) it
can be used to precompile macros into a .fmt file. When
called as virtex it will use the plain format. When called
under any other name, TeX will use that name as the name of
the format to use. For example, when called as tex the tex
format is used, which is identical to the plain format. The
commands defined by the plain for- mat are documented in The
TeX for nroffbook. Other formats that are often available
include latex and amstex.</p>

<p>The non-option command line arguments to the TeX program
are passed to it as the first input line. (But it is often
easier to type extended arguments as the first input line,
since UNIX shells tend to gobble up or misinterpret TeXs
favorite symbols, like backslashes, unless you quote them.)
As described in The TeX for nroffbook, that first line
should begin with a filename, a controlsequence, or a
&amp;formatname.</p>

<p>The normal usage is to say tex paper to start processing
paper.tex. The name paper will be the jobname, and is used
in forming output filenames. If TeX doesnt get a filename in
the first line, the jobname is texput. When looking for a
file, TeX looks for the name with and without the default
extension (.tex) appended, unless the name already contains
that extension. If paper is the jobname, a log of error
messages, with rather more detail than normally appears on
the screen, will appear in paper.log, and the out- put file
will be in paper.dvi.</p>

<p>This version of TeX can look in the first line of the
file paper.tex to see if it begins with the magic sequence
%&amp;. If the first line begins with %&amp;format
-translate-file tcxname then TeX will use the named for- mat
and transation table tcxname to process the source file.
Either the format name or the -translate-file specification
may be omitted, but not both. This overrides the format
selection based on the name by which the program is invoked.
The -parse-first-line option or the parse_first_line
configuration variable controls whether this behaviour is
enabled.</p>

<p>The e response to TeXs error prompt causes the system
default editor to start up at the current line of the
current file. The environment variable TEXEDIT can be used
to change the editor used. It may contain a string with
&quot;%s&quot; indicating where the filename goes and
&quot;%d&quot; indicat- ing where the decimal line number
(if any) goes. For example, a TEXEDIT string for emacs can
be set with the sh command TEXEDIT=&quot;emacs +%d %s&quot;;
export TEXEDIT</p>

<p>A convenient file in the library is null.tex, containing
nothing. When TeX can t find a file it thinks you want to
input, it keeps asking you for another filename; responding
null gets you out of the loop if you don t want to input
anything. You can also type your EOF character (usually
control-D).</p>

<p>OPTIONS This version of TeX understands the following
command line options.</p>

<p>-enc Enable the encTeX extensions. This option is only
effective in combination with -ini. For documentation of the
encTeX exten- sions see
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html.</p>

<p>-file-line-error Print error messages in the form
file:line:error which is simi- lar to the way many compilers
format them.</p>

<p>-no-file-line-error Disable printing error messages in
the file:line:error style.</p>

<p>-file-line-error-style This is the old name of the
-file-line-error option.</p>

<p>-fmt format Use format as the name of the format to be
used, instead of the name by which TeX was called or a
%&amp; line.</p>

<p>-halt-on-error Exit with an error code when an error is
encountered during pro- cessing.</p>

<p>-help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-ini Start in INI mode, which is used to dump formats.
The INI mode can be used for typesetting, but no format is
preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes
may be required.</p>

<p>-interaction mode Sets the interaction mode. The mode
can be either batchmode, nonstopmode, scrollmode, and
errorstopmode. The meaning of these modes is the same as
that of the corresponding -ipc Send DVI output to a socket
as well as the usual output file. Whether this option is
available is the choice of the installer.</p>

<p>-ipc-start As -ipc, and starts the server at the other
end as well. Whether this option is available is the choice
of the installer.</p>

<p>-jobname name Use name for the job name, instead of
deriving it from the name of the input file.</p>

<p>-kpathsea-debug bitmask Sets path searching debugging
flags according to the bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for
details.</p>

<p>-mktex fmt Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex
or tfm.</p>

<p>-mltex Enable MLTeX extensions. Only effective in
combination with -ini.</p>

<p>-no-mktex fmt Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either
tex or tfm.</p>

<p>-output-comment string Use string for the DVI file
comment instead of the date.</p>

<p>-output-directory directory Write output files in
directory instead of the current direc- tory. Look up input
files in directory first, then along the normal search path.
See also description of the TEXMFOUTPUT environment
variable.</p>

<p>-parse-first-line If the first line of the main input
file begins with %&amp; parse it to look for a dump name or
a -translate-file option.</p>

<p>-no-parse-first-line Disable parsing of the first line
of the main input file.</p>

<p>-progname name Pretend to be program name. This affects
both the format used and the search paths.</p>

<p>-recorder Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a
trace of the files opened for input and output in a file
with extension .fls.</p>

<p>-shell-escape Enable the 48rite18{command} construct.
The command can be any shell command. This construct is
normally disallowed for secu- rity reasons.</p>

<p>-no-shell-escape Disable the 48rite18{command}
construct, even if it is enabled in the texmf.cnf file.</p>

<p>-src-specials Insert source specials into the DVI
file.</p>

<p>-src-specials where Insert source specials in certain
places of the DVI file. where is a comma-separated value
list: cr, display, hbox, math, par, parent, or vbox.</p>

<p>-translate-file tcxname Use the tcxname translation
table to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping
of output characters.</p>

<p>-default-translate-file tcxname Like -translate-file
except that a %&amp; line can overrule this setting.</p>

<p>-version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT See the Kpathsearch library documentation
(the Path specifications node) for precise details of how
the environment variables are used. The kpsewhich utility
can be used to query the values of the variables.</p>

<p>One caveat: In most TeX formats, you cannot use ~ in a
filename you give directly to TeX, because ~ is an active
character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the
filename. Other programs, such as Metafont, do not have this
problem.</p>

<p>TEXMFOUTPUT Normally, TeX puts its output files in the
current directory. If any output file cannot be opened
there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in the
environment variable TEXMFOUT- PUT. There is no default
value for that variable. For example, if you say tex paper
and the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT
has the value /tmp, TeX attempts to create /tmp/paper.log
(and /tmp/paper.dvi, if any output is produced.)</p>

<p>TEXINPUTS Search path for input and openin files. This
should probably start with . , so that user files are found
before system files. An empty path component will be
replaced with the paths defined in the texmf.cnf file. For
example, set TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/usr/tex:&quot; to
prepend the current direcory and /home/user/tex to the
standard search path.</p>

<p>TEXFORMATS Search path for format files.</p>

<p>TEXPOOL search path for tex internal strings.</p>

<p>TEXEDIT Command template for switching to editor. The
default, usually vi, is set when TeX is compiled.</p>

<p>TFMFONTS Search path for font metric (.tfm) files.</p>

<p>FILES The location of the files mentioned below varies
from system to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find
their locations.</p>

<p>texmf.cnf Configuration file. This contains definitions
of search paths as well as other configuration parameters
like parse_first_line.</p>

<p>tex.pool Text file containing TeXs internal strings.</p>

<p>texfonts.map Filename mapping definitions.</p>

<p>*.tfm Metric files for TeXs fonts.</p>

<p>*.fmt Predigested TeX format (.fmt) files.</p>

<p>$TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/plain.tex The basic macro
package described in the TeX for nroffbook.</p>

<p>NOTES This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.
The complete documen- tation for this version of TeX can be
found in the info manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.</p>

<p>BUGS This version of TeX implements a number of optional
extensions. In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a
greater or lesser extent with the definition of TeX. When
such extensions are enabled, the ban- ner printed when TeX
starts is changed to print TeXk instead of TeX.</p>

<p>This version of TeX fails to trap arithmetic overflow
when dimensions are added or subtracted. Cases where this
occurs are rare, but when it does the generated DVI file
will be invalid.</p>

<p>TRIVIA TeX, pronounced properly, rhymes with blecchhh.
The proper spelling in typewriter-like fonts is TeX and not
TEX or tex.</p>

<p>AUTHORS TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who
implemented it using his Web system for Pascal programs. It
was ported to Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at
Cornell by Pavel Curtis. The version now offered with the
Unix TeX distribution is that generated by the Web to C
system (web2c), originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim
Morgan.</p>

<p>The encTeX extensions were written by Petr Olsak.</p>
