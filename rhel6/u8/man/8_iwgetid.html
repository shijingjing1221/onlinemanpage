<p>NAME iwgetid - Report ESSID, NWID or AP/Cell Address of
wireless network</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iwgetid [interface] [--raw] [--scheme] [--ap]
[--freq] [--mode] [--protocol] [--channel]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION iwgetid is used to find out the NWID, ESSID
or AP/Cell Address of the wireless network that is currently
used. The information reported is the same as the one shown
by iwconfig, but iwgetid is easier to inte- grate in various
scripts. By default, iwgetid will print the ESSID of the
device, and if the device doesnt have any ESSID it will
print its NWID. The default formatting output is
pretty-print.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --raw This option disables pretty-printing of
the information. This option is orthogonal to the other
options (except --scheme), so with the appropriate
combination of options you can print the raw ESSID, AP
Address or Mode. This format is ideal when storing the
result of iwgetid as a variable in Shell or Perl scripts or
to pass the result as an argument on the command line of
iwconfig.</p>

<p>--scheme This option is similar to the previous one, it
disables pretty- printing of the information and removes all
characters that are not alphanumerics (like space,
punctuation and control charac- ters). The resulting output
is a valid Pcmcia scheme identifier (that may be used as an
argument of the command cardctl scheme). This format is also
ideal when using the result of iwgetid as a selector in
Shell or Perl scripts, or as a file name.</p>

<p>--ap Display the MAC address of the Wireless Access
Point or the Cell.</p>

<p>--freq Display the current frequency or channel used by
the interface.</p>

<p>--channel Display the current channel used by the
interface. The channel is determined using the current
frequency and the frequency list provided by the
interface.</p>

<p>--mode Display the current mode of the interface.</p>

<p>--protocol Display the protocol name of the interface.
This allows to iden- tify all the cards that are compatible
with each other and accept the same type of configuration.
This can also be used to check Wireless Extension support on
the interface, as this is the only attribute that all
drivers sup- porting Wireless Extension are mandated to
support.</p>
