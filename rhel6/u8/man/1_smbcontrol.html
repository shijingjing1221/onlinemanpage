<p>SMBCONTROL(1) User Commands SMBCONTROL(1)</p>

<p>NAME smbcontrol - send messages to smbd, nmbd or
winbindd processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smbcontrol [-i] [-s]</p>

<p>smbcontrol [destination] [message-type] [parameter]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>smbcontrol is a very small program, which sends messages
to a smbd(8), a nmbd(8), or a winbindd(8) daemon running on
the system.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -?|--help Print a summary of command line
options.</p>

<p>-s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt; The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>-i Run interactively. Individual commands of the form
destination message-type parameters can be entered on STDIN.
An empty command line or a &quot;q&quot; will quit the
program.</p>

<p>destination One of nmbd, smbd or a process ID.</p>

<p>The all destination causes the message to
&quot;broadcast&quot; to all running daemons including nmbd
and winbind. This is a change for Samba 3.3, prior to this
the parameter smbd used to do this.</p>

<p>The smbd destination causes the message to be sent to
the smbd daemon specified in the smbd.pid file.</p>

<p>The nmbd destination causes the message to be sent to
the nmbd daemon specified in the nmbd.pid file.</p>

<p>The winbindd destination causes the message to be sent
to the winbind daemon specified in the winbindd.pid
file.</p>

<p>If a single process ID is given, the message is sent to
only that process.</p>

<p>message-type Type of message to send. See the section
MESSAGE-TYPES for details.</p>

<p>parameters any parameters required for the
message-type</p>

<p>MESSAGE-TYPES Available message types are:</p>

<p>close-share Order smbd to close the client connections
to the named share. Note that this doesn&rsquo;t affect
client connections to any other shares. This message-type
takes an argument of the share name for which client
connections will be closed, or the &quot;*&quot; character
which will close all currently open shares. This may be
useful if you made changes to the access controls on the
share. This message can only be sent to smbd.</p>

<p>debug Set debug level to the value specified by the
parameter. This can be sent to any of the destinations. If
this message is sent to either the smbd or winbindd daemons,
the parent process will rebroadcast the message to all child
processes changing the debug level in each one.</p>

<p>force-election This message causes the nmbd daemon to
force a new browse master election.</p>

<p>ping Send specified number of &quot;ping&quot; messages
and wait for the same number of reply &quot;pong&quot;
messages. This can be sent to any of the destinations.</p>

<p>profile Change profile settings of a daemon, based on
the parameter. The parameter can be &quot;on&quot; to turn
on profile stats collection, &quot;off&quot; to turn off
profile stats collection, &quot;count&quot; to enable only
collection of count stats (time stats are disabled), and
&quot;flush&quot; to zero the current profile stats. This
can be sent to any smbd or nmbd destinations.</p>

<p>debuglevel Request debuglevel of a certain daemon and
write it to stdout. This can be sent to any of the
destinations.</p>

<p>profilelevel Request profilelevel of a certain daemon
and write it to stdout. This can be sent to any smbd or nmbd
destinations.</p>

<p>printnotify Order smbd to send a printer notify message
to any Windows NT clients connected to a printer. This
message-type takes the following arguments:</p>

<p>queuepause printername Send a queue pause change notify
message to the printer specified.</p>

<p>queueresume printername Send a queue resume change
notify message for the printer specified.</p>

<p>jobpause printername unixjobid Send a job pause change
notify message for the printer and unix jobid specified.</p>

<p>jobresume printername unixjobid Send a job resume change
notify message for the printer and unix jobid specified.</p>

<p>jobdelete printername unixjobid Send a job delete change
notify message for the printer and unix jobid specified.</p>

<p>Note that this message only sends notification that an
event has occurred. It doesn&rsquo;t actually cause the
event to happen.</p>

<p>This message can only be sent to smbd.</p>

<p>samsync Order smbd to synchronise sam database from PDC
(being BDC). Can only be sent to smbd.</p>

<p>Note Not working at the moment</p>

<p>samrepl Send sam replication message, with specified
serial. Can only be sent to smbd. Should not be used
manually.</p>

<p>dmalloc-mark Set a mark for dmalloc. Can be sent to both
smbd and nmbd. Only available if samba is built with dmalloc
support.</p>

<p>dmalloc-log-changed Dump the pointers that have changed
since the mark set by dmalloc-mark. Can be sent to both smbd
and nmbd. Only available if samba is built with dmalloc
support.</p>

<p>shutdown Shut down specified daemon. Can be sent to both
smbd and nmbd.</p>

<p>pool-usage Print a human-readable description of all
talloc(pool) memory usage by the specified daemon/process.
Available for both smbd and nmbd.</p>

<p>drvupgrade Force clients of printers using specified
driver to update their local version of the driver. Can only
be sent to smbd.</p>

<p>reload-config Force daemon to reload smb.conf
configuration file. Can be sent to smbd, nmbd, or
winbindd.</p>

<p>idmap Notify about changes of id mapping. Can be sent to
smbd or (not implemented yet) winbindd.</p>

<p>flush [uid|gid] Flush caches for sid &lt;-&gt; gid
and/or sid &lt;-&gt; uid mapping.</p>

<p>delete &lt;ID&gt; Remove a mapping from cache. The
mapping is given by &lt;ID&gt; which may either be a sid:
S-x-..., a gid: &quot;GID number&quot; or a uid: &quot;UID
number&quot;.</p>

<p>kill &lt;ID&gt; Remove a mapping from cache. Terminate
smbd if the id is currently in use.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO nmbd(8) and smbd(8).</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
