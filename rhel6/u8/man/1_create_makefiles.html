<p>NAME create_makefiles - Recreates all Makefiles beneath
a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS create_makefiles [dir]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION create_makefiles recreates all Makefiles in
dir and its (recursed) sub- directories from the
corresponding Makefile.am templates.</p>

<p>This script must be run from the toplevel directory (the
one containing configure). This script saves time compared
to re-running configure completely.</p>

<p>If the source directory is different from the build
directory (see the environment variables below), it will be
assumed that each Makefile.am and Makefile.in belongs
beneath the source directory and that each Makefile belongs
beneath the build directory.</p>

<p>This utility is part of the KDE Software Development
Kit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT One of the following variables (but not
both) should be set if the source directory is different
from the build directory. If the build directory is simply a
subdirectory of the source directory, the simpler variable
OBJ_SUBDIR should be used.</p>

<p>OBJ_SUBJDIR Indicates that the build directory is in the
given subdirectory of the source directory. For instance, if
the source directory is kdesdk and the build directory is
kdesdk/obj-i386-linux, then OBJ_SUBDIR should be set to
obj-i386-linux.</p>

<p>OBJ_REPLACEMENT A sed expression that is used to
transform the source directory into the build directory. For
instance, if the source directory is kdesdk/obj-i386-linux,
then OBJ_REPLACEMENT should be set to
s#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#.</p>
