<p>NAME numa - overview of Non-Uniform Memory
Architecture</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) refers to
multiprocessor systems whose memory is divided into multiple
memory nodes. The access time of a memory node depends on
the relative locations of the accessing CPU and the accessed
node. (This contrasts with a symmetric multiprocessor
system, where the access time for all of the memory is the
same for all CPUs.) Normally, each CPU on a NUMA system has
a local memory node whose contents can be accessed faster
than the memory in the node local to another CPU or the
memory on a bus shared by all CPUs.</p>

<p>NUMA system calls The Linux kernel implements the
following NUMA-related system calls: get_mempolicy(2),
mbind(2), migrate_pages(2), move_pages(2), and
set_mempolicy(2). However, applications should normally use
the inter- face provided bu libnuma; see &quot;Library
Support&quot; below.</p>

<p>/proc/[number]/numa_maps (since Linux 2.6.14) This file
displays information about a processs NUMA memory policy and
allocation.</p>

<p>Each line contains information about a memory range used
by the pro- cess, displaying among other informationthe
effective memory policy for that memory range and on which
nodes the pages have been allocated.</p>

<p>numa_maps is a read-only file. When
/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/numa_maps is read, the kernel will scan
the virtual address space of the process and report how
memory is used. One line is displayed for each unique memory
range of the process.</p>

<p>The first field of each line shows the starting address
of the memory range. This field allows a correlation with
the contents of the /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps file, which
contains the end address of the range and other information,
such as the access permissions and sharing.</p>

<p>The second field shows the memory policy currently in
effect for the memory range. Note that the effective policy
is not necessarily the policy installed by the process for
that memory range. Specifically, if the process installed a
&quot;default&quot; policy for that range, the effec- tive
policy for that range will be the process policy, which may
or may not be &quot;default&quot;.</p>

<p>The rest of the line contains information about the
pages allocated in the memory range, as follows:</p>

<p>N&lt;node&gt;=&lt;nr_pages&gt; The number of pages
allocated on &lt;node&gt;. &lt;nr_pages&gt; includes only
pages currently mapped by the process. Page migration and
memory reclaim may have temporarily unmapped pages
associated with this memory range. These pages may only show
up again after the process has attempted to reference them.
If the mem- ory range represents a shared memory area or
file mapping, other processes may currently have additional
pages mapped in a corre- sponding memory range.</p>

<p>file=&lt;filename&gt; The file backing the memory range.
If the file is mapped as private, write accesses may have
generated COW (Copy-On-Write) pages in this memory range.
These pages are displayed as anony- mous pages.</p>

<p>heap Memory range is used for the heap.</p>

<p>stack Memory range is used for the stack.</p>

<p>huge Huge memory range. The page counts shown are huge
pages and not regular sized pages.</p>

<p>anon=&lt;pages&gt; The number of anonymous page in the
range.</p>

<p>dirty=&lt;pages&gt; Number of dirty pages</p>

<p>mapped=&lt;pages&gt; Total number of mapped pages, if
different from dirty and anon pages.</p>

<p>mapmax=&lt;count&gt; Maximum mapcount (number of
processes mapping a single page) encountered during the
scan. This may be used as an indicator of the degree of
sharing occurring in a given memory range.</p>

<p>swapcache=&lt;count&gt; Number of pages that have an
associated entry on a swap device.</p>

<p>active=&lt;pages&gt; The number of pages on the active
list. This field is only shown if different from the number
of pages in this range. This means that some inactive pages
exist in the memory range that may be removed from memory by
the swapper soon.</p>

<p>writeback=&lt;pages&gt; Number of pages that are
currently being written out to disk.</p>

<p>NOTES The Linux NUMA system calls and /proc interface
are only available if the kernel was configured and built
with the CONFIG_NUMA option.</p>

<p>Library Support Link with -lnuma to get the system call
definitions. libnuma and the required &lt;numaif.h&gt;
header are available in the numactl package.</p>

<p>However, applications should not use these system calls
directly. Instead, the higher level interface provided by
the numa(3) functions in the numactl package is recommended.
The numactl package is avail- able at
ftp://oss.sgi.com/www/projects/libnuma/download/. The
package is also included in some Linux distributions. Some
distributions include the development library and header in
the separate numactl- devel package.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO No standards govern NUMA interfaces.</p>
