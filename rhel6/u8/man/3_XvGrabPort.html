<p>XvGrabPort(3) libXv Functions XvGrabPort(3)</p>

<p>NAME XvGrabPort - lock port for exclusive use by
client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xvlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XvGrabPort(Display *dpy, XvPortID port, Time
time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dpy Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>port Defines the port to be grabbed.</p>

<p>time Specifies the request timestamp.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XvGrabPort(3) grabs a port. Once a client
grabs a port, only that client can make video requests to
that port.</p>

<p>If the time is before the current port time, the
XvGrabPort request is ignored and XvInvalidTime is returned.
If the port is already grabbed by another client,
XvAlreadyGrabbed is returned. Otherwise it returns a status
of Success. The port time is updated when the following
requests are processed: XvGrabPort(3), XvUngrabPort(3),
XvPutVideo(3), XvPutStill(3), XvGetVideo(3),
XvGetStill(3).</p>

<p>If the port is actively processing video for another
client, the video is preempted, and an XvVideoNotify event
with detail XvPreempted is generated for its drawable.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES [Success] Returned if XvGrabPort(3)
completed successfully.</p>

<p>[XvInvalidTime] Returned if requested time is older than
the current port time.</p>

<p>[XvAlreadyGrabbed] Returned if the port is already
grabbed by another client.</p>

<p>[XvBadExtension] Returned if the Xv extension is
unavailable.</p>

<p>[XvBadAlloc] Returned if XvGrabPort(3) failed to
allocate memory to process the request.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS [XvBadPort] Generated if the requested port
does not exist.</p>
