<p>curl_getenv(3) libcurl Manual curl_getenv(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_getenv - return value for environment name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *curl_getenv(const char *name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION curl_getenv() is a portable wrapper for the
getenv() function, meant to emulate its behaviour and
provide an identical interface for all oper- ating systems
libcurl builds on (including win32).</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This function will be removed from the
public libcurl API in a near future. It will instead be made
&quot;available&quot; by source code access only, and then
as curlx_getenv().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, curl_getenv() returns a
pointer to the value of the specified environment. The
memory it refers to is malloc()ed so the application must
free() this when the data is no longer needed. When
curl_getenv(3) fails to find the specified name, it returns
a null pointer.</p>

<p>NOTE Under unix operating systems, there isnt any point
in returning an allocated memory, although other systems won
t work properly if this isnt done. The unix implementation
thus has to suffer slightly from the drawbacks of other
systems.</p>
