<p>rhsm-icon(8) RHSM Desktop Icon rhsm-icon(8)</p>

<p>NAME rhsm-icon - Periodically checks installed products
against active sub- scriptions to check their status.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rhsm-icon [--check-period]
[--force-icon=warning|expired|partial]
[--check-immediately]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Red Hat provides content updates and support
by issuing subscriptions for its products. These
subscriptions are applied to systems (machines) and apply to
the installed software products.</p>

<p>On graphical X systems (systems with a GUI interface), a
product status daemon runs every 4 hours to check the
currently installed software against the applied
subscriptions. If software is installed without a valid and
applied subscription (such as a subscription expires or no
subscription is available for the product), then the daemon
triggers an icon and warning message to display in the
notification area of the menu.</p>

<p>rhsm-icon only runs on graphical (X-based) systems.
Servers which do not have a GUI interface do not run or
require the rhsm-icon daemon.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --check-period Sets the interval to use
between checks for the product sub- scription status. The
value is in seconds and the default is one day.</p>

<p>-f, --force-icon=TYPE Manually displays the given type
of icon in the start menu. The TYPE can be warning, expired,
or partial and uses a different icon for each type of
message.</p>

<p>--i, --check-immediately Runs the status check process
immediately when the command is invoked. Otherwise, there is
a four (4) minute delay before run- ning the initial
check.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Shows debug messages for the daemon.</p>

<p>USAGE There are two reasons to invoke rhsm-icon
manually:</p>

<p>* To run the daemon on a new schedule (immediately or
with a different frequency)</p>

<p>* To view the status icons or messages regardless of the
state of the machine</p>

<p>Since X runs the daemon automatically and on schedule,
it is not neces- sary to launch the subscription status
daemon manually. The rhsm-icon command can change this
schedule. For example: rhsm-icon --check-period 120</p>

<p>Administrators can also run rhsm-icon to view any
immediate changes to the subscription status of the system.
Using the --check-immediately option runs the check at the
time the command is run; otherwise, run- ning rhsm-icon has
a four-minute delay before running the status check.</p>

<p>rhsm-icon --check-immediately</p>

<p>If you just want to know what the different subscription
status mes- sages look like, then use the --force-icon
option. (Also use the --check-immediately option, or the
scan will take the standard four minutes to run and display
the icon.)</p>

<p>rhsm-icon --force-icon=warning --check-immediately
rhsm-icon --force-icon=expired --check-immediately rhsm-icon
--force-icon=partial --check-immediately</p>
