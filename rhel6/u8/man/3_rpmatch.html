<p>NAME rpmatch - determine if the answer to a question is
affirmative or nega- tive</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rpmatch(const char *response);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>rpmatch(): _SVID_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmatch() handles a user response to yes or
no questions, with support for internationalization.</p>

<p>response should be a null-terminated string containing a
user-supplied response, perhaps obtained with fgets(3) or
getline(3).</p>

<p>The users language preference is taken into account per
the environ- ment variables LANG, LC_MESSAGES, and LC_ALL,
if the program has called setlocale(3) to effect their
changes.</p>

<p>Regardless of the locale, responses matching ^[Yy] are
always accepted as affirmative, and those matching ^[Nn] are
always accepted as nega- tive.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE After examining response, rpmatch() returns
0 for a recognized negative response (&quot;no&quot;), 1 for
a recognized positive response (&quot;yes&quot;), and -1
when the value of response is unrecognized.</p>

<p>ERRORS A return value of -1 may indicate either an
invalid input, or some other error. It is incorrect to only
test if the return value is non- zero.</p>

<p>rpmatch() can fail for any of the reasons that
regcomp(3) or regexec(3) can fail; the cause of the error is
not available from errno or any- where else, but indicates a
failure of the regex engine (but this case is
indistinguishable from that of an unrecognized value of
response).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO rpmatch() is not required by any standard,
but is available on a few other systems.</p>

<p>BUGS The rpmatch() implementation looks at only the
first character of response. As a consequence,
&quot;nyes&quot; returns 0, and &quot;ynever; not in a
million years&quot; returns 1. It would be preferable to
accept input strings much more strictly, for example (using
the extended regular expression notation described in
regex(7)): ^([yY]|yes|YES)$ and ^([nN]|no|NO)$.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program displays the results when
rpmatch() is applied to the string given in the programs
command-line argument.</p>

<p>#define _SVID_SOURCE #include &lt;locale.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc != 2 ||
strcmp(argv[1], &quot;--help&quot;) == 0) { fprintf(stderr,
&quot;%s response0, argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>setlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;&quot;); printf(&quot;rpmatch()
returns: %d0, rpmatch(argv[1])); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
