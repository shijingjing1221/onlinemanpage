<p>MYSQLDUMP(1) MySQL Database System MYSQLDUMP(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysqldump - a database backup program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqldump [options] [db_name [tbl_name
...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mysqldump client is a backup program
originally written by Igor Romanenko. It can be used to dump
a database or a collection of databases for backup or
transfer to another SQL server (not necessarily a MySQL
server). The dump typically contains SQL statements to
create the table, populate it, or both. However, mysqldump
can also be used to generate files in CSV, other delimited
text, or XML format.</p>

<p>mysqldump requires at least the SELECT privilege for
dumped tables, SHOW VIEW for dumped views, TRIGGER for
dumped triggers, and LOCK TABLES if the --single-transaction
option is not used. Certain options might require other
privileges as noted in the option descriptions.</p>

<p>To reload a dump file, you must have the same privileges
needed to create each of the dumped objects by issuing
CREATE statements manually.</p>

<p>mysqldump output can include ALTER DATABASE statements
that change the database collation. These may be used when
dumping stored programs to preserve their character
encodings. To reload a dump file containing such statements,
the ALTER privilege for the affected database is
required.</p>

<p>If you are performing a backup on the server and your
tables all are MyISAM tables, you can also use mysqlhotcopy
for this purpose. Syntax</p>

<p>There are in general three ways to use mysqldump in
order to dump a set of one or more tables, a set of one or
more complete databases, or an entire MySQL serveras shown
here:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump [options] db_name [tbl_name ...]
shell&gt; mysqldump [options] --databases db_name ...
shell&gt; mysqldump [options] --all-databases</p>

<p>To dump entire databases, do not name any tables
following db_name, or use the --databases or --all-databases
option.</p>

<p>mysqldump does not dump the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database
by default. As of MySQL 5.1.38, mysqldump dumps
INFORMATION_SCHEMA if you name it explicitly on the command
line, although you must also use the --skip-lock-tables
option. Before 5.1.38, mysqldump silently ignores
INFORMATION_SCHEMA even if you name it explicitly on the
command line.</p>

<p>Before MySQL 5.1.64, mysqldump does not dump the
general_log or slow_query_log tables for dumps of the mysql
database. As of 5.1.64, the dump includes statements to
recreate those tables so that they are not missing after
reloading the dump file. Log table contents are not
dumped.</p>

<p>In MySQL Cluster NDB 7.1.7 and later, the ndbinfo
information database is ignored and not dumped by
mysqldump.</p>

<p>To see a list of the options your version of mysqldump
supports, execute mysqldump --help.</p>

<p>Some mysqldump options are shorthand for groups of other
options:</p>

<p>&middot; Use of --opt is the same as specifying
--add-drop-table, --add-locks, --create-options,
--disable-keys, --extended-insert, --lock-tables, --quick,
and --set-charset. All of the options that --opt stands for
also are on by default because --opt is on by default.</p>

<p>&middot; Use of --compact is the same as specifying
--skip-add-drop-table, --skip-add-locks, --skip-comments,
--skip-disable-keys, and --skip-set-charset options.</p>

<p>To reverse the effect of a group option, uses its
--skip-xxx form (--skip-opt or --skip-compact). It is also
possible to select only part of the effect of a group option
by following it with options that enable or disable specific
features. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>&middot; To select the effect of --opt except for some
features, use the --skip option for each feature. To disable
extended inserts and memory buffering, use --opt
--skip-extended-insert --skip-quick. (Actually,
--skip-extended-insert --skip-quick is sufficient because
--opt is on by default.)</p>

<p>&middot; To reverse --opt for all features except index
disabling and table locking, use --skip-opt --disable-keys
--lock-tables.</p>

<p>When you selectively enable or disable the effect of a
group option, order is important because options are
processed first to last. For example, --disable-keys
--lock-tables --skip-opt would not have the intended effect;
it is the same as --skip-opt by itself.</p>

<p>mysqldump can retrieve and dump table contents row by
row, or it can retrieve the entire content from a table and
buffer it in memory before dumping it. Buffering in memory
can be a problem if you are dumping large tables. To dump
tables row by row, use the --quick option (or --opt, which
enables --quick). The --opt option (and hence --quick) is
enabled by default, so to enable memory buffering, use
--skip-quick.</p>

<p>If you are using a recent version of mysqldump to
generate a dump to be reloaded into a very old MySQL server,
you should not use the --opt or --extended-insert option.
Use --skip-opt instead.</p>

<p>Note mysqldump from MySQL 5.1.21 cannot be used to
create dumps from MySQL server 5.1.20 and older. This issue
is fixed in MySQL 5.1.22. (Bug #30123)</p>

<p>mysqldump supports the following options, which can be
specified on the command line or in the [mysqldump] and
[client] groups of an option file. mysqldump also supports
the options for processing option files described at Section
4.2.3.4, Command-Line Options that Affect Option- File
Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --add-drop-database</p>

<p>Add a DROP DATABASE statement before each CREATE
DATABASE statement. This option is typically used in
conjunction with the --all-databases or --databases option
because no CREATE DATABASE statements are written unless one
of those options is specified.</p>

<p>&middot; --add-drop-table</p>

<p>Add a DROP TABLE statement before each CREATE TABLE
statement.</p>

<p>&middot; --add-drop-trigger</p>

<p>Add a DROP TRIGGER statement before each CREATE TRIGGER
statement.</p>

<p>Note This option is supported only by mysqldump as
supplied with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.38, MySQL Cluster NDB
7.0.19, MySQL Cluster NDB 7.1.8, and later MySQL Cluster
releases. It is not available when using MySQL 5.1.</p>

<p>&middot; --add-locks</p>

<p>Surround each table dump with LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK
TABLES statements. This results in faster inserts when the
dump file is reloaded. See Section 8.3.2.1, Speed of INSERT
Statements.</p>

<p>&middot; --all-databases, -A</p>

<p>Dump all tables in all databases. This is the same as
using the --databases option and naming all the databases on
the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --all-tablespaces, -Y</p>

<p>Adds to a table dump all SQL statements needed to create
any tablespaces used by an NDBCLUSTER table. This
information is not otherwise included in the output from
mysqldump. This option is currently relevant only to MySQL
Cluster tables.</p>

<p>This option was added in MySQL 5.1.6.</p>

<p>&middot; --allow-keywords</p>

<p>Permit creation of column names that are keywords. This
works by prefixing each column name with the table name.</p>

<p>&middot; --bind-address=ip_address</p>

<p>On a computer having multiple network interfaces, this
option can be used to select which interface is employed
when connecting to the MySQL server.</p>

<p>This option is supported only in the version of
mysqldump that is supplied with MySQL Cluster, beginning
with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.4. It is not available in
standard MySQL 5.1 releases.</p>

<p>&middot; --character-sets-dir=path</p>

<p>The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --comments, -i</p>

<p>Write additional information in the dump file such as
program version, server version, and host. This option is
enabled by default. To suppress this additional information,
use --skip-comments.</p>

<p>&middot; --compact</p>

<p>Produce more compact output. This option enables the
--skip-add-drop-table, --skip-add-locks, --skip-comments,
--skip-disable-keys, and --skip-set-charset options.</p>

<p>Note Prior to MySQL 5.1.21, this option did not create
valid SQL if the database dump contained views. The
recreation of views requires the creation and removal of
temporary tables and this option suppressed the removal of
those temporary tables. As a workaround, use --compact with
the --add-drop-table option and then manually adjust the
dump file.</p>

<p>&middot; --compatible=name</p>

<p>Produce output that is more compatible with other
database systems or with older MySQL servers. The value of
name can be ansi, mysql323, mysql40, postgresql, oracle,
mssql, db2, maxdb, no_key_options, no_table_options, or
no_field_options. To use several values, separate them by
commas. These values have the same meaning as the
corresponding options for setting the server SQL mode. See
Section 5.1.7, Server SQL Modes.</p>

<p>This option does not guarantee compatibility with other
servers. It only enables those SQL mode values that are
currently available for making dump output more compatible.
For example, --compatible=oracle does not map data types to
Oracle types or use Oracle comment syntax.</p>

<p>This option requires a server version of 4.1.0 or
higher. With older servers, it does nothing.</p>

<p>&middot; --complete-insert, -c</p>

<p>Use complete INSERT statements that include column
names.</p>

<p>&middot; --compress, -C</p>

<p>Compress all information sent between the client and the
server if both support compression.</p>

<p>&middot; --create-options</p>

<p>Include all MySQL-specific table options in the CREATE
TABLE statements.</p>

<p>&middot; --databases, -B</p>

<p>Dump several databases. Normally, mysqldump treats the
first name argument on the command line as a database name
and following names as table names. With this option, it
treats all name arguments as database names. CREATE DATABASE
and USE statements are included in the output before each
new database.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]</p>

<p>Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
&rsquo;d:t:o,file_name&rsquo;. The default value is
&rsquo;d:t:o,/tmp/mysqldump.trace&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-check</p>

<p>Print some debugging information when the program exits.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-info</p>

<p>Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
statistics when the program exits. This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.14.</p>

<p>&middot; --default-character-set=charset_name</p>

<p>Use charset_name as the default character set. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration. If no character
set is specified, mysqldump uses utf8, and earlier versions
use latin1.</p>

<p>Prior to MySQL 5.1.38, this option has no effect for
output data files produced by using the --tab option. See
the description for that option.</p>

<p>&middot; --delayed-insert</p>

<p>Write INSERT DELAYED statements rather than INSERT
statements.</p>

<p>&middot; --delete-master-logs</p>

<p>On a master replication server, delete the binary logs
by sending a PURGE BINARY LOGS statement to the server after
performing the dump operation. This option automatically
enables --master-data.</p>

<p>&middot; --disable-keys, -K</p>

<p>For each table, surround the INSERT statements with
/*!40000 ALTER TABLE tbl_name DISABLE KEYS */; and /*!40000
ALTER TABLE tbl_name ENABLE KEYS */; statements. This makes
loading the dump file faster because the indexes are created
after all rows are inserted. This option is effective only
for nonunique indexes of MyISAM tables. It has no effect for
other tables.</p>

<p>&middot; --dump-date</p>

<p>If the --comments option is given, mysqldump produces a
comment at the end of the dump of the following form:</p>

<p>-- Dump completed on DATE</p>

<p>However, the date causes dump files taken at different
times to appear to be different, even if the data are
otherwise identical. --dump-date and --skip-dump-date
control whether the date is added to the comment. The
default is --dump-date (include the date in the comment).
--skip-dump-date suppresses date printing. This option was
added in MySQL 5.1.23.</p>

<p>&middot; --events, -E</p>

<p>Include Event Scheduler events for the dumped databases
in the output. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.8.</p>

<p>&middot; --extended-insert, -e</p>

<p>Use multiple-row INSERT syntax that include several
VALUES lists. This results in a smaller dump file and speeds
up inserts when the file is reloaded.</p>

<p>&middot; --fields-terminated-by=...,
--fields-enclosed-by=...,
--fields-optionally-enclosed-by=...,
--fields-escaped-by=...</p>

<p>These options are used with the --tab option and have
the same meaning as the corresponding FIELDS clauses for
LOAD DATA INFILE. See Section 13.2.6, LOAD DATA INFILE
Syntax.</p>

<p>&middot; --first-slave</p>

<p>Deprecated. Use --lock-all-tables instead. --first-slave
is removed in MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>&middot; --flush-logs, -F</p>

<p>Flush the MySQL server log files before starting the
dump. This option requires the RELOAD privilege. If you use
this option in combination with the --all-databases option,
the logs are flushed for each database dumped. The exception
is when using --lock-all-tables or --master-data: In this
case, the logs are flushed only once, corresponding to the
moment that all tables are locked. If you want your dump and
the log flush to happen at exactly the same moment, you
should use --flush-logs together with either
--lock-all-tables or --master-data.</p>

<p>&middot; --flush-privileges</p>

<p>Add a FLUSH PRIVILEGES statement to the dump output
after dumping the mysql database. This option should be used
any time the dump contains the mysql database and any other
database that depends on the data in the mysql database for
proper restoration. This option was added in MySQL
5.1.12.</p>

<p>&middot; --force, -f</p>

<p>Continue even if an SQL error occurs during a table
dump.</p>

<p>One use for this option is to cause mysqldump to
continue executing even when it encounters a view that has
become invalid because the definition refers to a table that
has been dropped. Without --force, mysqldump exits with an
error message. With --force, mysqldump prints the error
message, but it also writes an SQL comment containing the
view definition to the dump output and continues
executing.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name, -h host_name</p>

<p>Dump data from the MySQL server on the given host. The
default host is localhost.</p>

<p>&middot; --hex-blob</p>

<p>Dump binary columns using hexadecimal notation (for
example, &rsquo;abc&rsquo; becomes 0x616263). The affected
data types are BINARY, VARBINARY, the BLOB types, and
BIT.</p>

<p>&middot; --ignore-table=db_name.tbl_name</p>

<p>Do not dump the given table, which must be specified
using both the database and table names. To ignore multiple
tables, use this option multiple times. This option also can
be used to ignore views.</p>

<p>&middot; --insert-ignore</p>

<p>Write INSERT IGNORE statements rather than INSERT
statements.</p>

<p>&middot; --lines-terminated-by=...</p>

<p>This option is used with the --tab option and has the
same meaning as the corresponding LINES clause for LOAD DATA
INFILE. See Section 13.2.6, LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax.</p>

<p>&middot; --lock-all-tables, -x</p>

<p>Lock all tables across all databases. This is achieved
by acquiring a global read lock for the duration of the
whole dump. This option automatically turns off
--single-transaction and --lock-tables.</p>

<p>&middot; --lock-tables, -l</p>

<p>For each dumped database, lock all tables to be dumped
before dumping them. The tables are locked with READ LOCAL
to permit concurrent inserts in the case of MyISAM tables.
For transactional tables such as InnoDB,
--single-transaction is a much better option than
--lock-tables because it does not need to lock the tables at
all.</p>

<p>Because --lock-tables locks tables for each database
separately, this option does not guarantee that the tables
in the dump file are logically consistent between databases.
Tables in different databases may be dumped in completely
different states.</p>

<p>&middot; --log-error=file_name</p>

<p>Log warnings and errors by appending them to the named
file. The default is to do no logging. This option was added
in MySQL 5.1.18.</p>

<p>&middot; --master-data[=value]</p>

<p>Use this option to dump a master replication server to
produce a dump file that can be used to set up another
server as a slave of the master. It causes the dump output
to include a CHANGE MASTER TO statement that indicates the
binary log coordinates (file name and position) of the
dumped server. These are the master server coordinates from
which the slave should start replicating after you load the
dump file into the slave.</p>

<p>If the option value is 2, the CHANGE MASTER TO statement
is written as an SQL comment, and thus is informative only;
it has no effect when the dump file is reloaded. If the
option value is 1, the statement is not written as a comment
and takes effect when the dump file is reloaded. If no
option value is specified, the default value is 1.</p>

<p>This option requires the RELOAD privilege and the binary
log must be enabled.</p>

<p>The --master-data option automatically turns off
--lock-tables. It also turns on --lock-all-tables, unless
--single-transaction also is specified, in which case, a
global read lock is acquired only for a short time at the
beginning of the dump (see the description for
--single-transaction). In all cases, any action on logs
happens at the exact moment of the dump.</p>

<p>It is also possible to set up a slave by dumping an
existing slave of the master. To do this, use the following
procedure on the existing slave:</p>

<p>1. Stop the slave&rsquo;s SQL thread and get its current
status:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD; mysql&gt; SHOW SLAVE
STATUS;</p>

<p>2. From the output of the SHOW SLAVE STATUS statement,
the binary log coordinates of the master server from which
the new slave should start replicating are the values of the
Relay_Master_Log_File and Exec_Master_Log_Pos fields. Denote
those values as file_name and file_pos.</p>

<p>3. Dump the slave server:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --master-data=2 --all-databases &gt;
dumpfile</p>

<p>Using --master-data=2 works only if binary logging has
been enabled on the slave. Otherwise, mysqldump fails with
the error Binlogging on server not active. In this case you
must handle any locking issues in another manner, using one
or more of --add-locks, --lock-tables, --lock-all-tables, or
--single-transaction, as required by your application and
environment.</p>

<p>4. Restart the slave:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; START SLAVE;</p>

<p>5. On the new slave, load the dump file:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql &lt; dumpfile</p>

<p>6. On the new slave, set the replication coordinates to
those of the master server obtained earlier:</p>

<p>mysql&gt; CHANGE MASTER TO -&gt; MASTER_LOG_FILE =
&rsquo;file_name&rsquo;, MASTER_LOG_POS = file_pos;</p>

<p>The CHANGE MASTER TO statement might also need other
parameters, such as MASTER_HOST to point the slave to the
correct master server host. Add any such parameters as
necessary.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-autocommit</p>

<p>Enclose the INSERT statements for each dumped table
within SET autocommit = 0 and COMMIT statements.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-create-db, -n</p>

<p>This option suppresses the CREATE DATABASE statements
that are otherwise included in the output if the --databases
or --all-databases option is given.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-create-info, -t</p>

<p>Do not write CREATE TABLE statements that re-create each
dumped table.</p>

<p>Note This option does not not exclude statements
creating log file groups or tablespaces from mysqldump
output; in MySQL 5.1.14 and later, you can use the
--no-tablespaces option for this purpose.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-data, -d</p>

<p>Do not write any table row information (that is, do not
dump table contents). This is useful if you want to dump
only the CREATE TABLE statement for the table (for example,
to create an empty copy of the table by loading the dump
file).</p>

<p>&middot; --no-set-names, -N</p>

<p>This has the same effect as --skip-set-charset.</p>

<p>&middot; --no-tablespaces, -y</p>

<p>This option suppresses all CREATE LOGFILE GROUP and
CREATE TABLESPACE statements in the output of mysqldump.</p>

<p>This option was added in MySQL 5.1.14.</p>

<p>&middot; --opt</p>

<p>This option is shorthand. It is the same as specifying
--add-drop-table --add-locks --create-options --disable-keys
--extended-insert --lock-tables --quick --set-charset. It
should give you a fast dump operation and produce a dump
file that can be reloaded into a MySQL server quickly.</p>

<p>The --opt option is enabled by default. Use --skip-opt
to disable it. See the discussion at the beginning of this
section for information about selectively enabling or
disabling a subset of the options affected by --opt.</p>

<p>&middot; --order-by-primary</p>

<p>Dump each table&rsquo;s rows sorted by its primary key,
or by its first unique index, if such an index exists. This
is useful when dumping a MyISAM table to be loaded into an
InnoDB table, but will make the dump operation take
considerably longer.</p>

<p>&middot; --password[=password], -p[password]</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. If
you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space
between the option and the password. If you omit the
password value following the --password or -p option on the
command line, mysqldump prompts for one.</p>

<p>Specifying a password on the command line should be
considered insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, End-User
Guidelines for Password Security. You can use an option file
to avoid giving the password on the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --pipe, -W</p>

<p>On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe.
This option applies only if the server supports named-pipe
connections.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num, -P port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.</p>

<p>&middot; --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</p>

<p>The connection protocol to use for connecting to the
server. It is useful when the other connection parameters
normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the
one you want. For details on the permissible values, see
Section 4.2.2, Connecting to the MySQL Server.</p>

<p>&middot; --quick, -q</p>

<p>This option is useful for dumping large tables. It
forces mysqldump to retrieve rows for a table from the
server a row at a time rather than retrieving the entire row
set and buffering it in memory before writing it out.</p>

<p>&middot; --quote-names, -Q</p>

<p>Quote identifiers (such as database, table, and column
names) within characters. If the ANSI_QUOTES SQL mode is
enabled, identifiers are quoted within &quot; characters.
This option is enabled by default. It can be disabled with
--skip-quote-names, but this option should be given after
any option such as --compatible that may enable
--quote-names.</p>

<p>&middot; --replace</p>

<p>Write REPLACE statements rather than INSERT statements.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.3.</p>

<p>&middot; --result-file=file_name, -r file_name</p>

<p>Direct output to a given file. This option should be
used on characters from being converted to carriage
return/newline sequences. The result file is 0 Windows to
prevent newline 0 created and its previous contents
overwritten, even if an error occurs while generating the
dump.</p>

<p>&middot; --routines, -R</p>

<p>Include stored routines (procedures and functions) for
the dumped databases in the output. Use of this option
requires the SELECT privilege for the mysql.proc table. The
output generated by using --routines contains CREATE
PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION statements to re-create the
routines. However, these statements do not include
attributes such as the routine creation and modification
timestamps. This means that when the routines are reloaded,
they will be created with the timestamps equal to the reload
time.</p>

<p>If you require routines to be re-created with their
original timestamp attributes, do not use --routines.
Instead, dump and reload the contents of the mysql.proc
table directly, using a MySQL account that has appropriate
privileges for the mysql database.</p>

<p>This option was added in MySQL 5.1.2. Before that,
stored routines are not dumped. Routine DEFINER values are
not dumped until MySQL 5.1.8. This means that before 5.1.8,
when routines are reloaded, they will be created with the
definer set to the reloading user. If you require routines
to be re-created with their original definer, dump and load
the contents of the mysql.proc table directly as described
earlier.</p>

<p>Prior to MySQL 5.1.62, this option had no effect when
used together with the --xml option. (Bug #11760384, Bug
#52792)</p>

<p>&middot; --set-charset</p>

<p>Add SET NAMES default_character_set to the output. This
option is enabled by default. To suppress the SET NAMES
statement, use --skip-set-charset.</p>

<p>&middot; --single-transaction</p>

<p>This option sets the transaction isolation mode to
REPEATABLE READ and sends a START TRANSACTION SQL statement
to the server before dumping data. It is useful only with
transactional tables such as InnoDB, because then it dumps
the consistent state of the database at the time when START
TRANSACTION was issued without blocking any
applications.</p>

<p>When using this option, you should keep in mind that
only InnoDB tables are dumped in a consistent state. For
example, any MyISAM or MEMORY tables dumped while using this
option may still change state.</p>

<p>While a --single-transaction dump is in process, to
ensure a valid dump file (correct table contents and binary
log coordinates), no other connection should use the
following statements: ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE,
RENAME TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE. A consistent read is not
isolated from those statements, so use of them on a table to
be dumped can cause the SELECT that is performed by
mysqldump to retrieve the table contents to obtain incorrect
contents or fail.</p>

<p>The --single-transaction option and the --lock-tables
option are mutually exclusive because LOCK TABLES causes any
pending transactions to be committed implicitly.</p>

<p>This option is not supported for MySQL Cluster tables;
the results cannot be guaranteed to be consistent due to the
fact that the NDBCLUSTER storage engine supports only the
READ_COMMITTED transaction isolation level. You should
always use NDB backup and restore instead.</p>

<p>To dump large tables, you should combine the
--single-transaction option with --quick.</p>

<p>&middot; --skip-comments</p>

<p>See the description for the --comments option.</p>

<p>&middot; --skip-opt</p>

<p>See the description for the --opt option.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path, -S path</p>

<p>For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to
use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.</p>

<p>&middot; --ssl*</p>

<p>Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect
to the server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys
and certificates. See Section 6.3.6.4, SSL Command Options
.</p>

<p>&middot; --tab=path, -T path</p>

<p>Produce tab-separated text-format data files. For each
dumped table, mysqldump creates a tbl_name.sql file that
contains the CREATE TABLE statement that creates the table,
and the server writes a tbl_name.txt file that contains its
data. The option value is the directory in which to write
the files.</p>

<p>Note This option should be used only when mysqldump is
run on the same machine as the mysqld server. You must have
the FILE privilege, and the server must have permission to
write files in the directory that you specify. By default,
the .txt data files are formatted using tab characters
between column values and a newline at the end of each line.
The format can be specified explicitly using the
--fields-xxx and --lines-terminated-by options.</p>

<p>As of MySQL 5.1.38, column values are converted to the
character set specified by the --default-character-set
option. Prior to 5.1.38 or if no such option is present,
values are dumped using the binary character set. In effect,
there is no character set conversion. If a table contains
columns in several character sets, the output data file will
as well and you may not be able to reload the file
correctly.</p>

<p>&middot; --tables</p>

<p>Override the --databases or -B option. mysqldump regards
all name arguments following the option as table names.</p>

<p>&middot; --triggers</p>

<p>Include triggers for each dumped table in the output.
This option is enabled by default; disable it with
--skip-triggers.</p>

<p>&middot; --tz-utc</p>

<p>This option enables TIMESTAMP columns to be dumped and
reloaded between servers in different time zones. mysqldump
sets its connection time zone to UTC and adds SET
TIME_ZONE=&rsquo;+00:00&rsquo; to the dump file. Without
this option, TIMESTAMP columns are dumped and reloaded in
the time zones local to the source and destination servers,
which can cause the values to change if the servers are in
different time zones. --tz-utc also protects against changes
due to daylight saving time. --tz-utc is enabled by default.
To disable it, use --skip-tz-utc. This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.2.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the
server.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
program does.</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --where=&rsquo;where_condition&rsquo;, -w
&rsquo;where_condition&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dump only rows selected by the given WHERE condition.
Quotes around the condition are mandatory if it contains
spaces or other characters that are special to your command
interpreter.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>--where=&quot;user=&rsquo;jimf&rsquo;&quot;
-w&quot;userid&gt;1&quot; -w&quot;userid&lt;1&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; --xml, -X</p>

<p>Write dump output as well-formed XML.</p>

<p>NULL, &rsquo;NULL&rsquo;, and Empty Values: For a column
named column_name, the NULL value, an empty string, and the
string value &rsquo;NULL&rsquo; are distinguished from one
another in the output generated by this option as
follows.</p>


<p>+----------------------+---------------------------------+
|Value: | XML Representation: |
+----------------------+---------------------------------+
|NULL (unknown value) | &lt;field
name=&quot;column_name&quot; | | | xsi:nil=&quot;true&quot;
/&gt; |
+----------------------+---------------------------------+
|&rsquo;&rsquo; (empty string) | &lt;field | | |
name=&quot;column_name&quot;&gt;&lt;/field&gt; |
+----------------------+---------------------------------+
|&rsquo;NULL&rsquo; (string value) | &lt;field | | |
name=&quot;column_name&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/field&gt; |
+----------------------+---------------------------------+
Beginning with MySQL 5.1.12, the output from the mysql
client when run using the --xml option also follows the
preceding rules. (See the section called MYSQL OPTIONS.)</p>

<p>Beginning with MySQL 5.1.18, XML output from mysqldump
includes the XML namespace, as shown here:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --xml -u root world City &lt;?xml

&lt;/row&gt; &lt;/table_data&gt; &lt;/database&gt;
&lt;/mysqldump&gt;</p>

<p>Prior to MySQL 5.1.62, this option prevented the
--routines option from working correctlythat is, no stored
routines, triggers, or events could be dumped in XML format.
(Bug #11760384, Bug #52792)</p>

<p>You can also set the following variables by using
--var_name=value syntax:</p>

<p>&middot; max_allowed_packet</p>

<p>The maximum size of the buffer for client/server
communication. The default is 24MB, the maximum is 1GB.</p>

<p>&middot; net_buffer_length</p>

<p>The initial size of the buffer for client/server
communication. When creating multiple-row INSERT statements
(as with the --extended-insert or --opt option), mysqldump
creates rows up to net_buffer_length length. If you increase
this variable, you should also ensure that the
net_buffer_length variable in the MySQL server is at least
this large.</p>

<p>A common use of mysqldump is for making a backup of an
entire database:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump db_name &gt; backup-file.sql</p>

<p>You can load the dump file back into the server like
this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql db_name &lt; backup-file.sql</p>

<p>Or like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysql -e &quot;source
/path-to-backup/backup-file.sql&quot; db_name</p>

<p>mysqldump is also very useful for populating databases
by copying data from one MySQL server to another:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --opt db_name | mysql
--host=remote_host -C db_name</p>

<p>It is possible to dump several databases with one
command:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --databases db_name1 [db_name2 ...]
&gt; my_databases.sql</p>

<p>To dump all databases, use the --all-databases
option:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --all-databases &gt;
all_databases.sql</p>

<p>For InnoDB tables, mysqldump provides a way of making an
online backup:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --all-databases --single-transaction
&gt; all_databases.sql</p>

<p>This backup acquires a global read lock on all tables
(using FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK) at the beginning of the
dump. As soon as this lock has been acquired, the binary log
coordinates are read and the lock is released. If long
updating statements are running when the FLUSH statement is
issued, the MySQL server may get stalled until those
statements finish. After that, the dump becomes lock free
and does not disturb reads and writes on the tables. If the
update statements that the MySQL server receives are short
(in terms of execution time), the initial lock period should
not be noticeable, even with many updates.</p>

<p>For point-in-time recovery (also known as roll-forward,
when you need to restore an old backup and replay the
changes that happened since that backup), it is often useful
to rotate the binary log (see Section 5.2.4, The Binary Log)
or at least know the binary log coordinates to which the
dump corresponds:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --all-databases --master-data=2 &gt;
all_databases.sql</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqldump --all-databases --flush-logs
--master-data=2 &gt; all_databases.sql</p>

<p>The --master-data and --single-transaction options can
be used simultaneously, which provides a convenient way to
make an online backup suitable for use prior to
point-in-time recovery if tables are stored using the InnoDB
storage engine.</p>

<p>For more information on making backups, see Section 7.2,
Database Backup Methods , and Section 7.3, Example Backup
and Recovery Strategy.</p>

<p>If you encounter problems backing up views, please read
the section that covers restrictions on views which
describes a workaround for backing up views when this fails
due to insufficient privileges. See Section E.4,
Restrictions on Views.</p>
