<p>PCRE_TABLE(5) PCRE_TABLE(5)</p>

<p>NAME pcre_table - format of Postfix PCRE tables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postmap -q &quot;string&quot;
pcre:/etc/postfix/filename</p>

<p>postmap -q - pcre:/etc/postfix/filename
&lt;inputfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix mail system uses optional tables
for address rewriting, mail routing, or access control.
These tables are usually in dbm or db format.</p>

<p>Alternatively, lookup tables can be specified in Perl
Compatible Regu- lar Expression form. In this case, each
input is compared against a list of patterns. When a match
is found, the corresponding result is returned and the
search is terminated.</p>

<p>To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix
system supports use the &quot;postconf -m&quot; command.</p>

<p>To test lookup tables, use the &quot;postmap -q&quot;
command as described in the SYNOPSIS above.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY With Postfix version 2.2 and earlier
specify &quot;postmap -fq&quot; to query a table that
contains case sensitive patterns. Patterns are case insensi-
tive by default.</p>

<p>TABLE FORMAT The general form of a PCRE table is:</p>

<p>/pattern/flags result When pattern matches the input
string, use the corresponding result value.</p>

<p>!/pattern/flags result When pattern does not match the
input string, use the corre- sponding result value.</p>

<p>if /pattern/flags</p>

<p>endif Match the input string against the patterns
between if and endif, if and only if that same input string
also matches pat- tern. The if..endif can nest.</p>

<p>Note: do not prepend whitespace to patterns inside
if..endif.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</p>

<p>if !/pattern/flags</p>

<p>endif Match the input string against the patterns
between if and endif, if and only if that same input string
does not match pat- tern. The if..endif can nest.</p>

<p>Note: do not prepend whitespace to patterns inside
if..endif.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.</p>

<p>blank lines and comments Empty lines and whitespace-only
lines are ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace
character is a #.</p>

<p>multi-line text A logical line starts with
non-whitespace text. A line that starts with whitespace
continues a logical line.</p>

<p>Each pattern is a perl-like regular expression. The
expression delim- iter can be any character, except
whitespace or characters that have special meaning
(traditionally the forward slash is used). The regular
expression can contain whitespace.</p>

<p>By default, matching is case-insensitive, and newlines
are not treated as special characters. The behavior is
controlled by flags, which are toggled by appending one or
more of the following characters after the pattern:</p>

<p>i (default: on) Toggles the case sensitivity flag. By
default, matching is case insensitive.</p>

<p>m (default: off) Toggles the PCRE_MULTILINE flag. When
this flag is on, the ^ and $ metacharacters match
immediately after and immediately before a newline
character, respectively, in addition to matching at the
start and end of the subject string.</p>

<p>s (default: on) Toggles the PCRE_DOTALL flag. When this
flag is on, the . metacharacter matches the newline
character. With Postfix ver- sions prior to 2.0, The flag is
off by default, which is incon- venient for multi-line
message header matching.</p>

<p>x (default: off) Toggles the pcre extended flag. When
this flag is on, whitespace characters in the pattern (other
than in a character class) are ignored. To include a
whitespace character as part of the pat- tern, escape it
with backslash.</p>

<p>Note: do not use #comment after patterns.</p>

<p>A (default: off) Toggles the PCRE_ANCHORED flag. When
this flag is on, the pat- tern is forced to be
&quot;anchored&quot;, that is, it is constrained to match
only at the start of the string which is being searched (the
&quot;subject string&quot;). This effect can also be
achieved by appropriate constructs in the pattern
itself.</p>

<p>E (default: off) Toggles the PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY flag.
When this flag is on, a $ metacharacter in the pattern
matches only at the end of the sub- ject string. Without
this flag, a dollar also matches immedi- ately before the
final character if it is a newline character (but not before
any other newline characters). This flag is ignored if
PCRE_MULTILINE flag is set.</p>

<p>U (default: off) Toggles the ungreedy matching flag.
When this flag is on, the pattern matching engine inverts
the &quot;greediness&quot; of the quanti- fiers so that they
are not greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by
&quot;?&quot;. This flag can also set by a (?U) modifier
within the pattern.</p>

<p>X (default: off) Toggles the PCRE_EXTRA flag. When this
flag is on, any back- slash in a pattern that is followed by
a letter that has no spe- cial meaning causes an error, thus
reserving these combinations for future expansion.</p>

<p>SEARCH ORDER Patterns are applied in the order as
specified in the table, until a pattern is found that
matches the input string.</p>

<p>Each pattern is applied to the entire input string.
Depending on the application, that string is an entire
client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
mail address. Thus, no parent domain or par- ent network
search is done, and user@domain mail addresses are not bro-
ken up into their user and domain constituent parts, nor is
user+foo broken up into user and foo.</p>

<p>TEXT SUBSTITUTION Substitution of substrings from the
matched expression into the result string is possible using
the conventional perl syntax ($1, $2, etc.); specify $$ to
produce a $ character as output. The macros in the result
string may need to be written as ${n} or $(n) if they arent
followed by whitespace.</p>

<p>Note: since negated patterns (those preceded by !)
return a result when the expression does not match,
substitutions are not available for negated patterns.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE SMTPD ACCESS MAP # Protect your outgoing
majordomo exploders /^(?!owner-)(.*)-outgoing@(.*)/ 550 Use
${1}@${2} instead</p>

<p># Bounce friend@whatever, except when whatever is our
domain (you would # be better just bouncing all friend@ mail
- this is just an example). /^(friend@(?!my.domain$).*)$/
550 Stick this in your pipe $1</p>

<p># A multi-line entry. The text is sent as one line. #
/^noddy@my.domain$/ 550 This user is a funny one. You really
don t want to send mail to them as it only makes their head
spin.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE HEADER FILTER MAP /^Subject: make money fast/
REJECT /^To: friend@public.com/ REJECT</p>

<p>EXAMPLE BODY FILTER MAP # First skip over base 64
encoded text to save CPU cycles. # Requires PCRE version 3.
~^[[:alnum:]+/]{60,}$~ OK</p>

<p># Put your own body patterns here.</p>
