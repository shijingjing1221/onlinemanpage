<p>ledmon(8) Intel(R) Enclosure LED Monitor Service
ledmon(8)</p>

<p>NAME ledmon - Intel(R) LED monitor service for storage
enclosures.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ledmon [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ledmon application is a daemon process
used to monitor a state of software RAID devices (md only)
or a state of block devices. The state is visualizing on
LEDs associated to each slot in an enclosure or a drive bay.
There are two types of system: 2-LEDs system (Activity LED,
Status LED) and 3-LEDs system (Activity LED, Locate LED,
Fail LED). This application has the highest priority when
accessing the LEDs.</p>

<p>The ledmon application uses SGPIO and SES-2 protocol to
control LEDs. The program implements IBPI patterns of
SFF-8489 specification for SGPIO. Please note some
enclosures do not stick close to SFF-8489 specification. It
might happen that enclosure processor will accept IBPI
pattern but it will blink LEDs not according to SFF-8489
specification or it has limited number of patterns
supported.</p>

<p>LED management (AHCI) and SAF-TE protocols are not
supported.</p>

<p>Theres no method provided to specify which RAID volume
should be monitored and which not. The ledmon application
monitors all RAID devices and visualizes their state.</p>

<p>The ledmon application has been verified to work with
Intel(R) storage controllers (i.e. Intel(R) AHCI controller
and Intel(R) SAS controller). The application might work
with storage controllers of other vendors (especially
SAS/SCSI controllers). However storage controllers of other
vendors have not been tested.</p>

<p>The ledmon application is part of Intel(R) Enclosure LED
Utilities. Only single instance of the application is
allowed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c or --config=path Sets a path to local
configuration file. If this option is specified the global
configuration file and user configuration file has no
effect.</p>

<p>-l or --log=path Sets a path to local log file. If this
option is specified the global log file /var/log/ledmon.log
is not used.</p>

<p>-t or --interval=seconds Sets time interval between
scans of sysfs. The value is given in seconds. The minimum
is 5 seconds the maximum is not specified.</p>

<p>--quiet or --error or --warning or --info or --debug or
--all Verbose level - quiet means no logging at all and all
means to log everything. The levels are given in order. If
user specifies more then one verbose option the last option
comes into effect.</p>

<p>-h or --help Prints this text out and exits.</p>

<p>-v or --version Displays version of ledmon and
information about the license and exits.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/ledmon.log Global log file, used by
ledmon application. To force logging to user defined file
use -l option switch.</p>

<p>~/.ledctl User configuration file, shared between ledmon
and all ledctl application instances.</p>

<p>/etc/ledcfg.conf Global configuration file, shared
between ledmon and all ledctl application instances.</p>

<p>BUGS The ledmon application does not recognize PFA state
(Predicted Failure Analysis), hence the PFA pattern from
SFF-8489 specification is not visualized.</p>
