<p>NAME ld - The GNU linker</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ld [options] objfile ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ld combines a number of object and archive
files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references.
Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run
ld.</p>

<p>ld accepts Linker Command Language files written in a
superset of AT&amp;T s Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking
process.</p>

<p>This man page does not describe the command language;
see the ld entry in &quot;info&quot; for full details on the
command language and on other aspects of the GNU linker.</p>

<p>This version of ld uses the general purpose BFD
libraries to operate on object files. This allows ld to
read, combine, and write object files in many different
formats---for example, COFF or &quot;a.out&quot;. Different
formats may be linked together to produce any available kind
of object file.</p>

<p>Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more
helpful than other linkers in providing diagnostic
information. Many linkers abandon execution immediately upon
encountering an error; whenever possible, ld continues
executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in
some cases, to get an output file in spite of the
error).</p>

<p>The GNU linker ld is meant to cover a broad range of
situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other
linkers. As a result, you have many choices to control its
behavior.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The linker supports a plethora of command-line
options, but in actual practice few of them are used in any
particular context. For instance, a frequent use of ld is to
link standard Unix object files on a standard, supported
Unix system. On such a system, to link a file
&quot;hello.o&quot;:</p>

<p>ld -o &lt;output&gt; /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc</p>

<p>This tells ld to produce a file called output as the
result of linking the file &quot;/lib/crt0.o&quot; with
&quot;hello.o&quot; and the library &quot;libc.a&quot;,
which will come from the standard search directories. (See
the discussion of the -l option below.)</p>

<p>Some of the command-line options to ld may be specified
at any point in the command line. However, options which
refer to files, such as -l or -T, cause the file to be read
at the point at which the option appears in the command
line, relative to the object files and other file options.
Repeating non-file options with a different argument will
either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences
(those further to the left on the command line) of that
option. Options which may be meaningfully specified more
than once are noted in the descriptions below.</p>

<p>Non-option arguments are object files or archives which
are to be linked together. They may follow, precede, or be
mixed in with command-line options, except that an object
file argument may not be placed between an option and its
argument.</p>

<p>Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object
file, but you can specify other forms of binary input files
using -l, -R, and the script command language. If no binary
input files at all are specified, the linker does not
produce any output, and issues the message No input
files.</p>

<p>If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object
file, it will assume that it is a linker script. A script
specified in this way augments the main linker script used
for the link (either the default linker script or the one
specified by using -T). This feature permits the linker to
link against a file which appears to be an object or an
archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or
uses &quot;INPUT&quot; or &quot;GROUP&quot; to load other
objects. Specifying a script in this way merely augments the
main linker script, with the extra commands placed after the
main script; use the -T option to replace the default linker
script entirely, but note the effect of the
&quot;INSERT&quot; command.</p>

<p>For options whose names are a single letter, option
arguments must either follow the option letter without
intervening whitespace, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.</p>

<p>For options whose names are multiple letters, either one
dash or two can precede the option name; for example,
-trace-symbol and --trace-symbol are equivalent.
Note---there is one exception to this rule. Multiple letter
options that start with a lower case o can only be preceded
by two dashes. This is to reduce confusion with the -o
option. So for example -omagic sets the output file name to
magic whereas --omagic sets the NMAGIC flag on the
output.</p>

<p>Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be
separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be
given as separate arguments immediately following the option
that requires them. For example, --trace-symbol foo and
--trace-symbol=foo are equivalent. Unique abbreviations of
the names of multiple-letter options are accepted.</p>

<p>Note---if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a
compiler driver (e.g. gcc) then all the linker command line
options should be prefixed by -Wl, (or whatever is
appropriate for the particular compiler driver) like
this:</p>

<p>gcc -Wl,--start-group foo.o bar.o -Wl,--end-group</p>

<p>This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver
program may silently drop the linker options, resulting in a
bad link. Confusion may also arise when passing options that
require values through a driver, as the use of a space
between option and argument acts as a separator, and causes
the driver to pass only the option to the linker and the
argument to the compiler. In this case, it is simplest to
use the joined forms of both single- and multiple-letter
options, such as:</p>

<p>gcc foo.o bar.o -Wl,-eENTRY -Wl,-Map=a.map</p>

<p>Here is a table of the generic command line switches
accepted by the GNU linker:</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>

<p>-a keyword This option is supported for HP/UX
compatibility. The keyword argument must be one of the
strings archive, shared, or default. -aarchive is
functionally equivalent to -Bstatic, and the other two
keywords are functionally equivalent to -Bdynamic. This
option may be used any number of times.</p>

<p>--audit AUDITLIB Adds AUDITLIB to the
&quot;DT_AUDIT&quot; entry of the dynamic section. AUDITLIB
is not checked for existence, nor will it use the DT_SONAME
specified in the library. If specified multiple times
&quot;DT_AUDIT&quot; will contain a colon separated list of
audit interfaces to use. If the linker finds an object with
an audit entry while searching for shared libraries, it will
add a corresponding &quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot; entry in the
output file. This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms
supporting the rtld-audit interface.</p>

<p>-A architecture --architecture=architecture In the
current release of ld, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures. In that ld configuration,
the architecture argument identifies the particular
architecture in the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and
modifying the archive- library search path.</p>

<p>Future releases of ld may support similar functionality
for other architecture families.</p>

<p>-b input-format --format=input-format ld may be
configured to support more than one kind of object file. If
your ld is configured this way, you can use the -b option to
specify the binary format for input object files that follow
this option on the command line. Even when ld is configured
to support alternative object formats, you dont usually need
to specify this, as ld should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
input-format is a text string, the name of a particular
format supported by the BFD libraries. (You can list the
available binary formats with objdump -i.)</p>

<p>You may want to use this option if you are linking files
with an unusual binary format. You can also use -b to switch
formats explicitly (when linking object files of different
formats), by including -b input-format before each group of
object files in a particular format.</p>

<p>The default format is taken from the environment
variable &quot;GNUTARGET&quot;.</p>

<p>You can also define the input format from a script,
using the command &quot;TARGET&quot;;</p>

<p>-c MRI-commandfile --mri-script=MRI-commandfile For
compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, ld accepts
script files written in an alternate, restricted command
language, described in the MRI Compatible Script Files
section of GNU ld documentation. Introduce MRI script files
with the option -c; use the -T option to run linker scripts
written in the general-purpose ld scripting language. If
MRI-cmdfile does not exist, ld looks for it in the
directories specified by any -L options.</p>

<p>-d -dc -dp These three options are equivalent; multiple
forms are supported for compatibility with other linkers.
They assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable
output file is specified (with -r). The script command
&quot;FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION&quot; has the same effect.</p>

<p>--depaudit AUDITLIB -P AUDITLIB Adds AUDITLIB to the
&quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot; entry of the dynamic section.
AUDITLIB is not checked for existence, nor will it use the
DT_SONAME specified in the library. If specified multiple
times &quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot; will contain a colon separated
list of audit interfaces to use. This option is only
meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the rtld-audit
interface. The -P option is provided for Solaris
compatibility.</p>

<p>-e entry --entry=entry Use entry as the explicit symbol
for beginning execution of your program, rather than the
default entry point. If there is no symbol named entry, the
linker will try to parse entry as a number, and use that as
the entry address (the number will be interpreted in base
10; you may use a leading 0x for base 16, or a leading 0 for
base 8).</p>

<p>--exclude-libs lib,lib,... Specifies a list of archive
libraries from which symbols should not be automatically
exported. The library names may be delimited by commas or
colons. Specifying &quot;--exclude-libs ALL&quot; excludes
symbols in all archive libraries from automatic export. This
option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port of
the linker and for ELF targeted ports. For i386 PE, symbols
explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported,
regardless of this option. For ELF targeted ports, symbols
affected by this option will be treated as hidden.</p>

<p>--exclude-modules-for-implib module,module,... Specifies
a list of object files or archive members, from which
symbols should not be automatically exported, but which
should be copied wholesale into the import library being
generated during the link. The module names may be delimited
by commas or colons, and must match exactly the filenames
used by ld to open the files; for archive members, this is
simply the member name, but for object files the name listed
must include and match precisely any path used to specify
the input file on the linker s command-line. This option is
available only for the i386 PE targeted port of the linker.
Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported,
regardless of this option.</p>

<p>-E --export-dynamic --no-export-dynamic When creating a
dynamically linked executable, using the -E option or the
--export-dynamic option causes the linker to add all symbols
to the dynamic symbol table. The dynamic symbol table is the
set of symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run
time.</p>

<p>If you do not use either of these options (or use the
--no-export-dynamic option to restore the default behavior),
the dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those
symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.</p>

<p>If you use &quot;dlopen&quot; to load a dynamic object
which needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the
program, rather than some other dynamic object, then you
will probably need to use this option when linking the
program itself.</p>

<p>You can also use the dynamic list to control what
symbols should be added to the dynamic symbol table if the
output format supports it. See the description of
--dynamic-list.</p>

<p>Note that this option is specific to ELF targeted ports.
PE targets support a similar function to export all symbols
from a DLL or EXE; see the description of
--export-all-symbols below.</p>

<p>-EB Link big-endian objects. This affects the default
output format.</p>

<p>-EL Link little-endian objects. This affects the default
output format.</p>

<p>-f name --auxiliary=name When creating an ELF shared
object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field to the specified
name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of
the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on
the symbol table of the shared object name.</p>

<p>If you later link a program against this filter object,
then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see
the DT_AUXILIARY field. If the dynamic linker resolves any
symbols from the filter object, it will first check whether
there is a definition in the shared object name. If there is
one, it will be used instead of the definition in the filter
object. The shared object name need not exist. Thus the
shared object name may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging
or for machine specific performance.</p>

<p>This option may be specified more than once. The
DT_AUXILIARY entries will be created in the order in which
they appear on the command line.</p>

<p>-F name --filter=name When creating an ELF shared
object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to the specified
name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of
the shared object which is being created should be used as a
filter on the symbol table of the shared object name.</p>

<p>If you later link a program against this filter object,
then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see
the DT_FILTER field. The dynamic linker will resolve symbols
according to the symbol table of the filter object as usual,
but it will actually link to the definitions found in the
shared object name. Thus the filter object can be used to
select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
name.</p>

<p>Some older linkers used the -F option throughout a
compilation toolchain for specifying object-file format for
both input and output object files. The GNU linker uses
other mechanisms for this purpose: the -b, --format,
--oformat options, the &quot;TARGET&quot; command in linker
scripts, and the &quot;GNUTARGET&quot; environment variable.
The GNU linker will ignore the -F option when not creating
an ELF shared object.</p>

<p>-fini=name When creating an ELF executable or shared
object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is
unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the address of the function.
By default, the linker uses &quot;_fini&quot; as the
function to call.</p>

<p>-g Ignored. Provided for compatibility with other
tools.</p>

<p>-G value --gpsize=value Set the maximum size of objects
to be optimized using the GP register to size. This is only
meaningful for object file formats such as MIPS ECOFF which
supports putting large and small objects into different
sections. This is ignored for other object file formats.</p>

<p>-h name -soname=name When creating an ELF shared object,
set the internal DT_SONAME field to the specified name. When
an executable is linked with a shared object which has a
DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by
the DT_SONAME field rather than the using the file name
given to the linker.</p>

<p>-i Perform an incremental link (same as option -r).</p>

<p>-init=name When creating an ELF executable or shared
object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is
loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address of the function.
By default, the linker uses &quot;_init&quot; as the
function to call.</p>

<p>-l namespec --library=namespec Add the archive or object
file specified by namespec to the list of files to link.
This option may be used any number of times. If namespec is
of the form :filename, ld will search the library path for a
file called filename, otherwise it will search the library
path for a file called libnamespec.a.</p>

<p>On systems which support shared libraries, ld may also
search for files other than libnamespec.a. Specifically, on
ELF and SunOS systems, ld will search a directory for a
library called libnamespec.so before searching for one
called libnamespec.a. (By convention, a &quot;.so&quot;
extension indicates a shared library.) Note that this
behavior does not apply to :filename, which always specifies
a file called filename.</p>

<p>The linker will search an archive only once, at the
location where it is specified on the command line. If the
archive defines a symbol which was undefined in some object
which appeared before the archive on the command line, the
linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive. However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing
later on the command line will not cause the linker to
search the archive again.</p>

<p>See the -( option for a way to force the linker to
search archives multiple times.</p>

<p>You may list the same archive multiple times on the
command line.</p>

<p>This type of archive searching is standard for Unix
linkers. However, if you are using ld on AIX, note that it
is different from the behaviour of the AIX linker.</p>

<p>-L searchdir --library-path=searchdir Add path searchdir
to the list of paths that ld will search for archive
libraries and ld control scripts. You may use this option
any number of times. The directories are searched in the
order in which they are specified on the command line.
Directories specified on the command line are searched
before the default directories. All -L options apply to all
-l options, regardless of the order in which the options
appear. -L options do not affect how ld searches for a
linker script unless -T option is specified.</p>

<p>If searchdir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the
&quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix, a path
specified when the linker is configured.</p>

<p>The default set of paths searched (without being
specified with -L) depends on which emulation mode ld is
using, and in some cases also on how it was configured.</p>

<p>The paths can also be specified in a link script with
the &quot;SEARCH_DIR&quot; command. Directories specified
this way are searched at the point in which the linker
script appears in the command line.</p>

<p>-m emulation Emulate the emulation linker. You can list
the available emulations with the --verbose or -V
options.</p>

<p>If the -m option is not used, the emulation is taken
from the &quot;LDEMULATION&quot; environment variable, if
that is defined.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.</p>

<p>-M --print-map Print a link map to the standard output.
A link map provides information about the link, including
the following:</p>

<p>&middot; Where object files are mapped into memory.</p>

<p>&middot; How common symbols are allocated.</p>

<p>&middot; All archive members included in the link, with
a mention of the symbol which caused the archive member to
be brought in.</p>

<p>&middot; The values assigned to symbols.</p>

<p>Note - symbols whose values are computed by an
expression which involves a reference to a previous value of
the same symbol may not have correct result displayed in the
link map. This is because the linker discards intermediate
results and only retains the final value of an expression.
Under such circumstances the linker will display the final
value enclosed by square brackets. Thus for example a linker
script containing:</p>

<p>foo = 1 foo = foo * 4 foo = foo + 8</p>

<p>will produce the following output in the link map if the
-M option is used:</p>

<p>0x00000001 foo = 0x1 [0x0000000c] foo = (foo * 0x4)
[0x0000000c] foo = (foo + 0x8)</p>

<p>See Expressions for more information about expressions
in linker scripts.</p>

<p>-n --nmagic Turn off page alignment of sections, and
mark the output as &quot;NMAGIC&quot; if possible.</p>

<p>-N --omagic Set the text and data sections to be
readable and writable. Also, do not page-align the data
segment, and disable linking against shared libraries. If
the output format supports Unix style magic numbers, mark
the output as &quot;OMAGIC&quot;. Note: Although a writable
text section is allowed for PE-COFF targets, it does not
conform to the format specification published by
Microsoft.</p>

<p>--no-omagic This option negates most of the effects of
the -N option. It sets the text section to be read-only, and
forces the data segment to be page-aligned. Note - this
option does not enable linking against shared libraries. Use
-Bdynamic for this.</p>

<p>-o output --output=output Use output as the name for the
program produced by ld; if this option is not specified, the
name a.out is used by default. The script command
&quot;OUTPUT&quot; can also specify the output file
name.</p>

<p>-O level If level is a numeric values greater than zero
ld optimizes the output. This might take significantly
longer and therefore probably should only be enabled for the
final binary. At the moment this option only affects ELF
shared library generation. Future releases of the linker may
make more use of this option. Also currently there is no
difference in the linkers behaviour for different non-zero
values of this option. Again this may change with future
releases.</p>

<p>-q --emit-relocs Leave relocation sections and contents
in fully linked executables. Post link analysis and
optimization tools may need this information in order to
perform correct modifications of executables. This results
in larger executables.</p>

<p>This option is currently only supported on ELF
platforms.</p>

<p>--force-dynamic Force the output file to have dynamic
sections. This option is specific to VxWorks targets.</p>

<p>-r --relocatable Generate relocatable output---i.e.,
generate an output file that can in turn serve as input to
ld. This is often called partial linking. As a side effect,
in environments that support standard Unix magic numbers,
this option also sets the output files magic number to
&quot;OMAGIC&quot;. If this option is not specified, an
absolute file is produced. When linking C++ programs, this
option will not resolve references to constructors; to do
that, use -Ur.</p>

<p>When an input file does not have the same format as the
output file, partial linking is only supported if that input
file does not contain any relocations. Different output
formats can have further restrictions; for example some
&quot;a.out&quot;-based formats do not support partial
linking with input files in other formats at all.</p>

<p>This option does the same thing as -i.</p>

<p>-R filename --just-symbols=filename Read symbol names
and their addresses from filename, but do not relocate it or
include it in the output. This allows your output file to
refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined
in other programs. You may use this option more than
once.</p>

<p>For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the -R
option is followed by a directory name, rather than a file
name, it is treated as the -rpath option.</p>

<p>-s --strip-all Omit all symbol information from the
output file.</p>

<p>-S --strip-debug Omit debugger symbol information (but
not all symbols) from the output file.</p>

<p>-t --trace Print the names of the input files as ld
processes them.</p>

<p>-T scriptfile --script=scriptfile Use scriptfile as the
linker script. This script replaces lds default linker
script (rather than adding to it), so commandfile must
specify everything necessary to describe the output file. If
scriptfile does not exist in the current directory,
&quot;ld&quot; looks for it in the directories specified by
any preceding -L options. Multiple -T options
accumulate.</p>

<p>-dT scriptfile --default-script=scriptfile Use
scriptfile as the default linker script.</p>

<p>This option is similar to the --script option except
that processing of the script is delayed until after the
rest of the command line has been processed. This allows
options placed after the --default-script option on the
command line to affect the behaviour of the linker script,
which can be important when the linker command line cannot
be directly controlled by the user. (eg because the command
line is being constructed by another tool, such as gcc).</p>

<p>-u symbol --undefined=symbol Force symbol to be entered
in the output file as an undefined symbol. Doing this may,
for example, trigger linking of additional modules from
standard libraries. -u may be repeated with different option
arguments to enter additional undefined symbols. This option
is equivalent to the &quot;EXTERN&quot; linker script
command.</p>

<p>-Ur For anything other than C++ programs, this option is
equivalent to -r: it generates relocatable output---i.e., an
output file that can in turn serve as input to ld. When
linking C++ programs, -Ur does resolve references to
constructors, unlike -r. It does not work to use -Ur on
files that were themselves linked with -Ur; once the
constructor table has been built, it cannot be added to. Use
-Ur only for the last partial link, and -r for the
others.</p>

<p>--unique[=SECTION] Creates a separate output section for
every input section matching SECTION, or if the optional
wildcard SECTION argument is missing, for every orphan input
section. An orphan section is one not specifically mentioned
in a linker script. You may use this option multiple times
on the command line; It prevents the normal merging of input
sections with the same name, overriding output section
assignments in a linker script.</p>

<p>-v --version -V Display the version number for ld. The
-V option also lists the supported emulations.</p>

<p>-x --discard-all Delete all local symbols.</p>

<p>-X --discard-locals Delete all temporary local symbols.
(These symbols start with system-specific local label
prefixes, typically .L for ELF systems or L for traditional
a.out systems.)</p>

<p>-y symbol --trace-symbol=symbol Print the name of each
linked file in which symbol appears. This option may be
given any number of times. On many systems it is necessary
to prepend an underscore.</p>

<p>This option is useful when you have an undefined symbol
in your link but dont know where the reference is coming
from.</p>

<p>-Y path Add path to the default library search path.
This option exists for Solaris compatibility.</p>

<p>-z keyword The recognized keywords are:</p>

<p>combreloc Combines multiple reloc sections and sorts
them to make dynamic symbol lookup caching possible.</p>

<p>defs Disallows undefined symbols in object files.
Undefined symbols in shared libraries are still allowed.</p>

<p>execstack Marks the object as requiring executable
stack.</p>

<p>initfirst This option is only meaningful when building a
shared object. It marks the object so that its runtime
initialization will occur before the runtime initialization
of any other objects brought into the process at the same
time. Similarly the runtime finalization of the object will
occur after the runtime finalization of any other
objects.</p>

<p>interpose Marks the object that its symbol table
interposes before all symbols but the primary
executable.</p>

<p>lazy When generating an executable or shared library,
mark it to tell the dynamic linker to defer function call
resolution to the point when the function is called (lazy
binding), rather than at load time. Lazy binding is the
default.</p>

<p>loadfltr Marks the object that its filters be processed
immediately at runtime.</p>

<p>muldefs Allows multiple definitions.</p>

<p>nocombreloc Disables multiple reloc sections
combining.</p>

<p>nocopyreloc Disables production of copy relocs.</p>

<p>nodefaultlib Marks the object that the search for
dependencies of this object will ignore any default library
search paths.</p>

<p>nodelete Marks the object shouldnt be unloaded at
runtime.</p>

<p>nodlopen Marks the object not available to
&quot;dlopen&quot;.</p>

<p>nodump Marks the object can not be dumped by
&quot;dldump&quot;.</p>

<p>noexecstack Marks the object as not requiring executable
stack.</p>

<p>norelro Dont create an ELF &quot;PT_GNU_RELRO&quot;
segment header in the object.</p>

<p>now When generating an executable or shared library,
mark it to tell the dynamic linker to resolve all symbols
when the program is started, or when the shared library is
linked to using dlopen, instead of deferring function call
resolution to the point when the function is first
called.</p>

<p>origin Marks the object may contain $ORIGIN.</p>

<p>relro Create an ELF &quot;PT_GNU_RELRO&quot; segment
header in the object.</p>

<p>max-page-size=value Set the emulation maximum page size
to value.</p>

<p>common-page-size=value Set the emulation common page
size to value.</p>

<p>Other keywords are ignored for Solaris
compatibility.</p>

<p>-( archives -) --start-group archives --end-group The
archives should be a list of archive files. They may be
either explicit file names, or -l options.</p>

<p>The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no
new undefined references are created. Normally, an archive
is searched only once in the order that it is specified on
the command line. If a symbol in that archive is needed to
resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in an
archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference. By grouping the
archives, they all be searched repeatedly until all possible
references are resolved.</p>

<p>Using this option has a significant performance cost. It
is best to use it only when there are unavoidable circular
references between two or more archives.</p>

<p>--accept-unknown-input-arch
--no-accept-unknown-input-arch Tells the linker to accept
input files whose architecture cannot be recognised. The
assumption is that the user knows what they are doing and
deliberately wants to link in these unknown input files.
This was the default behaviour of the linker, before release
2.14. The default behaviour from release 2.14 onwards is to
reject such input files, and so the
--accept-unknown-input-arch option has been added to restore
the old behaviour.</p>

<p>--as-needed --no-as-needed This option affects ELF
DT_NEEDED tags for dynamic libraries mentioned on the
command line after the --as-needed option. Normally the
linker will add a DT_NEEDED tag for each dynamic library
mentioned on the command line, regardless of whether the
library is actually needed or not. --as-needed causes a
DT_NEEDED tag to only be emitted for a library that
satisfies an undefined symbol reference from a regular
object file or, if the library is not found in the DT_NEEDED
lists of other libraries linked up to that point, an
undefined symbol reference from another dynamic library.
--no-as-needed restores the default behaviour.</p>

<p>--add-needed --no-add-needed These two options have been
deprecated because of the similarity of their names to the
--as-needed and --no-as-needed options. They have been
replaced by --copy-dt-needed-entries and
--no-copy-dt-needed-entries.</p>

<p>-assert keyword This option is ignored for SunOS
compatibility.</p>

<p>-Bdynamic -dy -call_shared Link against dynamic
libraries. This is only meaningful on platforms for which
shared libraries are supported. This option is normally the
default on such platforms. The different variants of this
option are for compatibility with various systems. You may
use this option multiple times on the command line: it
affects library searching for -l options which follow
it.</p>

<p>-Bgroup Set the &quot;DF_1_GROUP&quot; flag in the
&quot;DT_FLAGS_1&quot; entry in the dynamic section. This
causes the runtime linker to handle lookups in this object
and its dependencies to be performed only inside the group.
--unresolved-symbols=report-all is implied. This option is
only meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared
libraries.</p>

<p>-Bstatic -dn -non_shared -static Do not link against
shared libraries. This is only meaningful on platforms for
which shared libraries are supported. The different variants
of this option are for compatibility with various systems.
You may use this option multiple times on the command line:
it affects library searching for -l options which follow it.
This option also implies --unresolved-symbols=report-all.
This option can be used with -shared. Doing so means that a
shared library is being created but that all of the librarys
external references must be resolved by pulling in entries
from static libraries.</p>

<p>-Bsymbolic When creating a shared library, bind
references to global symbols to the definition within the
shared library, if any. Normally, it is possible for a
program linked against a shared library to override the
definition within the shared library. This option is only
meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared
libraries.</p>

<p>-Bsymbolic-functions When creating a shared library,
bind references to global function symbols to the definition
within the shared library, if any. This option is only
meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared
libraries.</p>

<p>--dynamic-list=dynamic-list-file Specify the name of a
dynamic list file to the linker. This is typically used when
creating shared libraries to specify a list of global
symbols whose references shouldnt be bound to the definition
within the shared library, or creating dynamically linked
executables to specify a list of symbols which should be
added to the symbol table in the executable. This option is
only meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared
libraries.</p>

<p>The format of the dynamic list is the same as the
version node without scope and node name. See VERSION for
more information.</p>

<p>--dynamic-list-data Include all global data symbols to
the dynamic list.</p>

<p>--dynamic-list-cpp-new Provide the builtin dynamic list
for C++ operator new and delete. It is mainly useful for
building shared libstdc++.</p>

<p>--dynamic-list-cpp-typeinfo Provide the builtin dynamic
list for C++ runtime type identification.</p>

<p>--check-sections --no-check-sections Asks the linker not
to check section addresses after they have been assigned to
see if there are any overlaps. Normally the linker will
perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will
produce suitable error messages. The linker does know about,
and does make allowances for sections in overlays. The
default behaviour can be restored by using the command line
switch --check-sections. Section overlap is not usually
checked for relocatable links. You can force checking in
that case by using the --check-sections option.</p>

<p>--copy-dt-needed-entries --no-copy-dt-needed-entries
This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries
referred to by DT_NEEDED tags inside ELF dynamic libraries
mentioned on the command line. Normally the linker will add
a DT_NEEDED tag to the output binary for each library
mentioned in a DT_NEEDED tag in an input dynamic library.
With --no-copy-dt-needed-entries specified on the command
line however any dynamic libraries that follow it will have
their DT_NEEDED entries ignored. The default behaviour can
be restored with --copy-dt-needed-entries.</p>

<p>This option also has an effect on the resolution of
symbols in dynamic libraries. With the default setting
dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line will be
recursively searched, following their DT_NEEDED tags to
other libraries, in order to resolve symbols required by the
output binary. With --no-copy-dt-needed-entries specified
however the searching of dynamic libraries that follow it
will stop with the dynamic library itself. No DT_NEEDED
links will be traversed to resolve symbols.</p>

<p>--cref Output a cross reference table. If a linker map
file is being generated, the cross reference table is
printed to the map file. Otherwise, it is printed on the
standard output.</p>

<p>The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that
it may be easily processed by a script if necessary. The
symbols are printed out, sorted by name. For each symbol, a
list of file names is given. If the symbol is defined, the
first file listed is the location of the definition. The
remaining files contain references to the symbol.</p>

<p>--no-define-common This option inhibits the assignment
of addresses to common symbols. The script command
&quot;INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION&quot; has the same
effect.</p>

<p>The --no-define-common option allows decoupling the
decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the
choice of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable
output type forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using --no-define-common allows Common symbols that are
referenced from a shared library to be assigned addresses
only in the main program. This eliminates the unused
duplicate space in the shared library, and also prevents any
possible confusion over resolving to the wrong duplicate
when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.</p>

<p>--defsym=symbol=expression Create a global symbol in the
output file, containing the absolute address given by
expression. You may use this option as many times as
necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line. A
limited form of arithmetic is supported for the expression
in this context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the
name of an existing symbol, or use &quot;+&quot; and
&quot;-&quot; to add or subtract hexadecimal constants or
symbols. If you need more elaborate expressions, consider
using the linker command language from a script. Note: there
should be no white space between symbol, the equals sign
(&quot;=&quot;), and expression.</p>

<p>--demangle[=style] --no-demangle These options control
whether to demangle symbol names in error messages and other
output. When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to
present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips
leading underscores if they are used by the object file
format, and converts C++ mangled symbol names into user
readable names. Different compilers have different mangling
styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.
The linker will demangle by default unless the environment
variable COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE is set. These options may be
used to override the default.</p>

<p>-Ifile --dynamic-linker=file Set the name of the dynamic
linker. This is only meaningful when generating dynamically
linked ELF executables. The default dynamic linker is
normally correct; dont use this unless you know what you are
doing.</p>

<p>--fatal-warnings --no-fatal-warnings Treat all warnings
as errors. The default behaviour can be restored with the
option --no-fatal-warnings.</p>

<p>--force-exe-suffix Make sure that an output file has a
.exe suffix.</p>

<p>If a successfully built fully linked output file does
not have a &quot;.exe&quot; or &quot;.dll&quot; suffix, this
option forces the linker to copy the output file to one of
the same name with a &quot;.exe&quot; suffix. This option is
useful when using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft
Windows host, since some versions of Windows wont run an
image unless it ends in a &quot;.exe&quot; suffix.</p>

<p>--gc-sections --no-gc-sections Enable garbage collection
of unused input sections. It is ignored on targets that do
not support this option. The default behaviour (of not
performing this garbage collection) can be restored by
specifying --no-gc-sections on the command line.</p>

<p>--gc-sections decides which input sections are used by
examining symbols and relocations. The section containing
the entry symbol and all sections containing symbols
undefined on the command-line will be kept, as will sections
containing symbols referenced by dynamic objects. Note that
when building shared libraries, the linker must assume that
any visible symbol is referenced. Once this initial set of
sections has been determined, the linker recursively marks
as used any section referenced by their relocations. See
--entry and --undefined.</p>

<p>This option can be set when doing a partial link
(enabled with option -r). In this case the root of symbols
kept must be explicitely specified either by an --entry or
--undefined option or by a &quot;ENTRY&quot; command in the
linker script.</p>

<p>--print-gc-sections --no-print-gc-sections List all
sections removed by garbage collection. The listing is
printed on stderr. This option is only effective if garbage
collection has been enabled via the --gc-sections) option.
The default behaviour (of not listing the sections that are
removed) can be restored by specifying
--no-print-gc-sections on the command line.</p>

<p>--help Print a summary of the command-line options on
the standard output and exit.</p>

<p>--target-help Print a summary of all target specific
options on the standard output and exit.</p>

<p>-Map=mapfile Print a link map to the file mapfile. See
the description of the -M option, above.</p>

<p>--no-keep-memory ld normally optimizes for speed over
memory usage by caching the symbol tables of input files in
memory. This option tells ld to instead optimize for memory
usage, by rereading the symbol tables as necessary. This may
be required if ld runs out of memory space while linking a
large executable.</p>

<p>--no-undefined -z defs Report unresolved symbol
references from regular object files. This is done even if
the linker is creating a non-symbolic shared library. The
switch --[no-]allow-shlib-undefined controls the behaviour
for reporting unresolved references found in shared
libraries being linked in.</p>

<p>--allow-multiple-definition -z muldefs Normally when a
symbol is defined multiple times, the linker will report a
fatal error. These options allow multiple definitions and
the first definition will be used.</p>

<p>--allow-shlib-undefined --no-allow-shlib-undefined
Allows or disallows undefined symbols in shared libraries.
This switch is similar to --no-undefined except that it
determines the behaviour when the undefined symbols are in a
shared library rather than a regular object file. It does
not affect how undefined symbols in regular object files are
handled.</p>

<p>The default behaviour is to report errors for any
undefined symbols referenced in shared libraries if the
linker is being used to create an executable, but to allow
them if the linker is being used to create a shared
library.</p>

<p>The reasons for allowing undefined symbol references in
shared libraries specified at link time are that:</p>

<p>&middot; A shared library specified at link time may not
be the same as the one that is available at load time, so
the symbol might actually be resolvable at load time.</p>

<p>&middot; There are some operating systems, eg BeOS and
HPPA, where undefined symbols in shared libraries are
normal.</p>

<p>The BeOS kernel for example patches shared libraries at
load time to select whichever function is most appropriate
for the current architecture. This is used, for example, to
dynamically select an appropriate memset function.</p>

<p>--no-undefined-version Normally when a symbol has an
undefined version, the linker will ignore it. This option
disallows symbols with undefined version and a fatal error
will be issued instead.</p>

<p>--default-symver Create and use a default symbol version
(the soname) for unversioned exported symbols.</p>

<p>--default-imported-symver Create and use a default
symbol version (the soname) for unversioned imported
symbols.</p>

<p>--no-warn-mismatch Normally ld will give an error if you
try to link together input files that are mismatched for
some reason, perhaps because they have been compiled for
different processors or for different endiannesses. This
option tells ld that it should silently permit such possible
errors. This option should only be used with care, in cases
when you have taken some special action that ensures that
the linker errors are inappropriate.</p>

<p>--no-warn-search-mismatch Normally ld will give a
warning if it finds an incompatible library during a library
search. This option silences the warning.</p>

<p>--no-whole-archive Turn off the effect of the
--whole-archive option for subsequent archive files.</p>

<p>--noinhibit-exec Retain the executable output file
whenever it is still usable. Normally, the linker will not
produce an output file if it encounters errors during the
link process; it exits without writing an output file when
it issues any error whatsoever.</p>

<p>-nostdlib Only search library directories explicitly
specified on the command line. Library directories specified
in linker scripts (including linker scripts specified on the
command line) are ignored.</p>

<p>--oformat=output-format ld may be configured to support
more than one kind of object file. If your ld is configured
this way, you can use the --oformat option to specify the
binary format for the output object file. Even when ld is
configured to support alternative object formats, you dont
usually need to specify this, as ld should be configured to
produce as a default output format the most usual format on
each machine. output-format is a text string, the name of a
particular format supported by the BFD libraries. (You can
list the available binary formats with objdump -i.) The
script command &quot;OUTPUT_FORMAT&quot; can also specify
the output format, but this option overrides it.</p>

<p>-pie --pic-executable Create a position independent
executable. This is currently only supported on ELF
platforms. Position independent executables are similar to
shared libraries in that they are relocated by the dynamic
linker to the virtual address the OS chooses for them (which
can vary between invocations). Like normal dynamically
linked executables they can be executed and symbols defined
in the executable cannot be overridden by shared
libraries.</p>

<p>-qmagic This option is ignored for Linux
compatibility.</p>

<p>-Qy This option is ignored for SVR4 compatibility.</p>

<p>--relax An option with machine dependent effects. This
option is only supported on a few targets.</p>

<p>On some platforms, the --relax option performs global
optimizations that become possible when the linker resolves
addressing in the program, such as relaxing address modes
and synthesizing new instructions in the output object
file.</p>

<p>On some platforms these link time global optimizations
may make symbolic debugging of the resulting executable
impossible. This is known to be the case for the Matsushita
MN10200 and MN10300 family of processors.</p>

<p>On platforms where this is not supported, --relax is
accepted, but ignored.</p>

<p>--retain-symbols-file=filename Retain only the symbols
listed in the file filename, discarding all others. filename
is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line. This
option is especially useful in environments (such as
VxWorks) where a large global symbol table is accumulated
gradually, to conserve run-time memory.</p>

<p>--retain-symbols-file does not discard undefined
symbols, or symbols needed for relocations.</p>

<p>You may only specify --retain-symbols-file once in the
command line. It overrides -s and -S.</p>

<p>-rpath=dir Add a directory to the runtime library search
path. This is used when linking an ELF executable with
shared objects. All -rpath arguments are concatenated and
passed to the runtime linker, which uses them to locate
shared objects at runtime. The -rpath option is also used
when locating shared objects which are needed by shared
objects explicitly included in the link; see the description
of the -rpath-link option. If -rpath is not used when
linking an ELF executable, the contents of the environment
variable &quot;LD_RUN_PATH&quot; will be used if it is
defined.</p>

<p>The -rpath option may also be used on SunOS. By default,
on SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of
all the -L options it is given. If a -rpath option is used,
the runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the
-rpath options, ignoring the -L options. This can be useful
when using gcc, which adds many -L options which may be on
NFS mounted file systems.</p>

<p>For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the -R
option is followed by a directory name, rather than a file
name, it is treated as the -rpath option.</p>

<p>-rpath-link=dir When using ELF or SunOS, one shared
library may require another. This happens when an &quot;ld
-shared&quot; link includes a shared library as one of the
input files.</p>

<p>When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing
a non- shared, non-relocatable link, it will automatically
try to locate the required shared library and include it in
the link, if it is not included explicitly. In such a case,
the -rpath-link option specifies the first set of
directories to search. The -rpath-link option may specify a
sequence of directory names either by specifying a list of
names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple
times.</p>

<p>This option should be used with caution as it overrides
the search path that may have been hard compiled into a
shared library. In such a case it is possible to use
unintentionally a different search path than the runtime
linker would do.</p>

<p>The linker uses the following search paths to locate
required shared libraries:</p>

<p>1. Any directories specified by -rpath-link options.</p>

<p>2. Any directories specified by -rpath options. The
difference between -rpath and -rpath-link is that
directories specified by -rpath options are included in the
executable and used at runtime, whereas the -rpath-link
option is only effective at link time. Searching -rpath in
this way is only supported by native linkers and cross
linkers which have been configured with the --with-sysroot
option.</p>

<p>3. On an ELF system, for native linkers, if the -rpath
and -rpath-link options were not used, search the contents
of the environment variable &quot;LD_RUN_PATH&quot;.</p>

<p>4. On SunOS, if the -rpath option was not used, search
any directories specified using -L options.</p>

<p>5. For a native linker, the search the contents of the
environment variable &quot;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;.</p>

<p>6. For a native ELF linker, the directories in
&quot;DT_RUNPATH&quot; or &quot;DT_RPATH&quot; of a shared
library are searched for shared libraries needed by it. The
&quot;DT_RPATH&quot; entries are ignored if
&quot;DT_RUNPATH&quot; entries exist.</p>

<p>7. The default directories, normally /lib and
/usr/lib.</p>

<p>8. For a native linker on an ELF system, if the file
/etc/ld.so.conf exists, the list of directories found in
that file.</p>

<p>If the required shared library is not found, the linker
will issue a warning and continue with the link.</p>

<p>-shared -Bshareable Create a shared library. This is
currently only supported on ELF, XCOFF and SunOS platforms.
On SunOS, the linker will automatically create a shared
library if the -e option is not used and there are undefined
symbols in the link.</p>

<p>--sort-common --sort-common=ascending
--sort-common=descending This option tells ld to sort the
common symbols by alignment in ascending or descending order
when it places them in the appropriate output sections. The
symbol alignments considered are sixteen-byte or larger,
eight-byte, four-byte, two-byte, and one- byte. This is to
prevent gaps between symbols due to alignment constraints.
If no sorting order is specified, then descending order is
assumed.</p>

<p>--sort-section=name This option will apply
&quot;SORT_BY_NAME&quot; to all wildcard section patterns in
the linker script.</p>

<p>--sort-section=alignment This option will apply
&quot;SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT&quot; to all wildcard section
patterns in the linker script.</p>

<p>--split-by-file[=size] Similar to --split-by-reloc but
creates a new output section for each input file when size
is reached. size defaults to a size of 1 if not given.</p>

<p>--split-by-reloc[=count] Tries to creates extra sections
in the output file so that no single output section in the
file contains more than count relocations. This is useful
when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the COFF object file format;
since COFF cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a
single section. Note that this will fail to work with object
file formats which do not support arbitrary sections. The
linker will not split up individual input sections for
redistribution, so if a single input section contains more
than count relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations. count defaults to a value of 32768.</p>

<p>--stats Compute and display statistics about the
operation of the linker, such as execution time and memory
usage.</p>

<p>--sysroot=directory Use directory as the location of the
sysroot, overriding the configure-time default. This option
is only supported by linkers that were configured using
--with-sysroot.</p>

<p>--traditional-format For some targets, the output of ld
is different in some ways from the output of some existing
linker. This switch requests ld to use the traditional
format instead.</p>

<p>For example, on SunOS, ld combines duplicate entries in
the symbol string table. This can reduce the size of an
output file with full debugging information by over 30
percent. Unfortunately, the SunOS &quot;dbx&quot; program
can not read the resulting program (&quot;gdb&quot; has no
trouble). The --traditional-format switch tells ld to not
combine duplicate entries.</p>

<p>--section-start=sectionname=org Locate a section in the
output file at the absolute address given by org. You may
use this option as many times as necessary to locate
multiple sections in the command line. org must be a single
hexadecimal integer; for compatibility with other linkers,
you may omit the leading 0x usually associated with
hexadecimal values. Note: there should be no white space
between sectionname, the equals sign (&quot;=&quot;), and
org.</p>

<p>-Tbss=org -Tdata=org -Ttext=org Same as --section-start,
with &quot;.bss&quot;, &quot;.data&quot; or
&quot;.text&quot; as the sectionname.</p>

<p>-Ttext-segment=org When creating an ELF executable or
shared object, it will set the address of the first byte of
the text segment.</p>

<p>--unresolved-symbols=method Determine how to handle
unresolved symbols. There are four possible values for
method:</p>

<p>ignore-all Do not report any unresolved symbols.</p>

<p>report-all Report all unresolved symbols. This is the
default.</p>

<p>ignore-in-object-files Report unresolved symbols that
are contained in shared libraries, but ignore them if they
come from regular object files.</p>

<p>ignore-in-shared-libs Report unresolved symbols that
come from regular object files, but ignore them if they come
from shared libraries. This can be useful when creating a
dynamic binary and it is known that all the shared libraries
that it should be referencing are included on the linkers
command line.</p>

<p>The behaviour for shared libraries on their own can also
be controlled by the --[no-]allow-shlib-undefined
option.</p>

<p>Normally the linker will generate an error message for
each reported unresolved symbol but the option
--warn-unresolved-symbols can change this to a warning.</p>

<p>--dll-verbose --verbose Display the version number for
ld and list the linker emulations supported. Display which
input files can and cannot be opened. Display the linker
script being used by the linker.</p>

<p>--version-script=version-scriptfile Specify the name of
a version script to the linker. This is typically used when
creating shared libraries to specify additional information
about the version hierarchy for the library being created.
This option is only fully supported on ELF platforms which
support shared libraries; see VERSION. It is partially
supported on PE platforms, which can use version scripts to
filter symbol visibility in auto-export mode: any symbols
marked local in the version script will not be exported.</p>

<p>--warn-common Warn when a common symbol is combined with
another common symbol or with a symbol definition. Unix
linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practise, but linkers on
some other operating systems do not. This option allows you
to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practise, so you
may get some warnings about symbols in the libraries as well
as in your programs.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated
here by C examples:</p>

<p>int i = 1; A definition, which goes in the initialized
data section of the output file.</p>

<p>extern int i; An undefined reference, which does not
allocate space. There must be either a definition or a
common symbol for the variable somewhere.</p>

<p>int i; A common symbol. If there are only (one or more)
common symbols for a variable, it goes in the uninitialized
data area of the output file. The linker merges multiple
common symbols for the same variable into a single symbol.
If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest size.
The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if
there is a definition of the same variable.</p>

<p>The --warn-common option can produce five kinds of
warnings. Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the
first describes the symbol just encountered, and the second
describes the previous symbol encountered with the same
name. One or both of the two symbols will be a common
symbol.</p>

<p>1. Turning a common symbol into a reference, because
there is already a definition for the symbol.</p>

<p>&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common of
&lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; overridden by definition
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: defined here</p>

<p>2. Turning a common symbol into a reference, because a
later definition for the symbol is encountered. This is the
same as the previous case, except that the symbols are
encountered in a different order.</p>

<p>&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: definition of
&lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; overriding common
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common is here</p>

<p>3. Merging a common symbol with a previous same-sized
common symbol.</p>

<p>&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: multiple common
of &lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo;
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: previous common is
here</p>

<p>4. Merging a common symbol with a previous larger common
symbol.</p>

<p>&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common of
&lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; overridden by larger common
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: larger common is
here</p>

<p>5. Merging a common symbol with a previous smaller
common symbol. This is the same as the previous case, except
that the symbols are encountered in a different order.</p>

<p>&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common of
&lsquo;&lt;symbol&gt;&rsquo; overriding smaller common
&lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: smaller common is
here</p>

<p>--warn-constructors Warn if any global constructors are
used. This is only useful for a few object file formats. For
formats like COFF or ELF, the linker can not detect the use
of global constructors.</p>

<p>--warn-multiple-gp Warn if multiple global pointer
values are required in the output file. This is only
meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in
a special section. A special register (the global pointer)
points into the middle of this section, so that constants
can be loaded efficiently via a base-register relative
addressing mode. Since the offset in base-register relative
mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16 bits), this
limits the maximum size of the constant pool. Thus, in large
programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global
pointer values in order to be able to address all possible
constants. This option causes a warning to be issued
whenever this case occurs.</p>

<p>--warn-once Only warn once for each undefined symbol,
rather than once per module which refers to it.</p>

<p>--warn-section-align Warn if the address of an output
section is changed because of alignment. Typically, the
alignment will be set by an input section. The address will
only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that is, if
the &quot;SECTIONS&quot; command does not specify a start
address for the section.</p>

<p>--warn-shared-textrel Warn if the linker adds a
DT_TEXTREL to a shared object.</p>

<p>--warn-alternate-em Warn if an object has alternate ELF
machine code.</p>

<p>--warn-unresolved-symbols If the linker is going to
report an unresolved symbol (see the option
--unresolved-symbols) it will normally generate an error.
This option makes it generate a warning instead.</p>

<p>--error-unresolved-symbols This restores the linker s
default behaviour of generating errors when it is reporting
unresolved symbols.</p>

<p>--whole-archive For each archive mentioned on the
command line after the --whole-archive option, include every
object file in the archive in the link, rather than
searching the archive for the required object files. This is
normally used to turn an archive file into a shared library,
forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library. This option may be used more than once.</p>

<p>Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc
doesnt know about this option, so you have to use
-Wl,-whole-archive. Second, don t forget to use
-Wl,-no-whole-archive after your list of archives, because
gcc will add its own list of archives to your link and you
may not want this flag to affect those as well.</p>

<p>--wrap=symbol Use a wrapper function for symbol. Any
undefined reference to symbol will be resolved to
&quot;__wrap_symbol&quot;. Any undefined reference to
&quot;__real_symbol&quot; will be resolved to symbol.</p>

<p>This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system
function. The wrapper function should be called
&quot;__wrap_symbol&quot;. If it wishes to call the system
function, it should call &quot;__real_symbol&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is a trivial example:</p>

<p>void * __wrap_malloc (size_t c) { printf (&quot;malloc
called with %zu0, c); return __real_malloc (c); }</p>

<p>If you link other code with this file using --wrap
malloc, then all calls to &quot;malloc&quot; will call the
function &quot;__wrap_malloc&quot; instead. The call to
&quot;__real_malloc&quot; in &quot;__wrap_malloc&quot; will
call the real &quot;malloc&quot; function.</p>

<p>You may wish to provide a &quot;__real_malloc&quot;
function as well, so that links without the --wrap option
will succeed. If you do this, you should not put the
definition of &quot;__real_malloc&quot; in the same file as
&quot;__wrap_malloc&quot;; if you do, the assembler may
resolve the call before the linker has a chance to wrap it
to &quot;malloc&quot;.</p>

<p>--eh-frame-hdr Request creation of
&quot;.eh_frame_hdr&quot; section and ELF
&quot;PT_GNU_EH_FRAME&quot; segment header.</p>

<p>--enable-new-dtags --disable-new-dtags This linker can
create the new dynamic tags in ELF. But the older ELF
systems may not understand them. If you specify
--enable-new-dtags, the dynamic tags will be created as
needed. If you specify --disable-new-dtags, no new dynamic
tags will be created. By default, the new dynamic tags are
not created. Note that those options are only available for
ELF systems.</p>

<p>--hash-size=number Set the default size of the linkers
hash tables to a prime number close to number. Increasing
this value can reduce the length of time it takes the linker
to perform its tasks, at the expense of increasing the
linkers memory requirements. Similarly reducing this value
can reduce the memory requirements at the expense of
speed.</p>

<p>--hash-style=style Set the type of linkers hash
table(s). style can be either &quot;sysv&quot; for classic
ELF &quot;.hash&quot; section, &quot;gnu&quot; for new style
GNU &quot;.gnu.hash&quot; section or &quot;both&quot; for
both the classic ELF &quot;.hash&quot; and new style GNU
&quot;.gnu.hash&quot; hash tables. The default is
&quot;sysv&quot;.</p>

<p>--reduce-memory-overheads This option reduces memory
requirements at ld runtime, at the expense of linking speed.
This was introduced to select the old O(n^2) algorithm for
link map file generation, rather than the new O(n) algorithm
which uses about 40% more memory for symbol storage.</p>

<p>Another effect of the switch is to set the default hash
table size to 1021, which again saves memory at the cost of
lengthening the linkers run time. This is not done however
if the --hash-size switch has been used.</p>

<p>The --reduce-memory-overheads switch may be also be used
to enable other tradeoffs in future versions of the
linker.</p>

<p>--build-id --build-id=style Request creation of
&quot;.note.gnu.build-id&quot; ELF note section. The
contents of the note are unique bits identifying this linked
file. style can be &quot;uuid&quot; to use 128 random bits,
&quot;sha1&quot; to use a 160-bit SHA1 hash on the normative
parts of the output contents, &quot;md5&quot; to use a
128-bit MD5 hash on the normative parts of the output
contents, or &quot;0xhexstring&quot; to use a chosen bit
string specified as an even number of hexadecimal digits
(&quot;-&quot; and &quot;:&quot; characters between digit
pairs are ignored). If style is omitted, &quot;sha1&quot; is
used.</p>

<p>The &quot;md5&quot; and &quot;sha1&quot; styles produces
an identifier that is always the same in an identical output
file, but will be unique among all nonidentical output
files. It is not intended to be compared as a checksum for
the files contents. A linked file may be changed later by
other tools, but the build ID bit string identifying the
original linked file does not change.</p>

<p>Passing &quot;none&quot; for style disables the setting
from any &quot;--build-id&quot; options earlier on the
command line.</p>

<p>The i386 PE linker supports the -shared option, which
causes the output to be a dynamically linked library (DLL)
instead of a normal executable. You should name the output
&quot;*.dll&quot; when you use this option. In addition, the
linker fully supports the standard &quot;*.def&quot; files,
which may be specified on the linker command line like an
object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a
normal object file).</p>

<p>In addition to the options common to all targets, the
i386 PE linker support additional command line options that
are specific to the i386 PE target. Options that take values
may be separated from their values by either a space or an
equals sign.</p>

<p>--add-stdcall-alias If given, symbols with a stdcall
suffix (@nn) will be exported as- is and also with the
suffix stripped. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--base-file file Use file as the name of a file in which
to save the base addresses of all the relocations needed for
generating DLLs with dlltool. [This is an i386 PE specific
option]</p>

<p>--dll Create a DLL instead of a regular executable. You
may also use -shared or specify a &quot;LIBRARY&quot; in a
given &quot;.def&quot; file. [This option is specific to the
i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--enable-long-section-names --disable-long-section-names
The PE variants of the Coff object format add an extension
that permits the use of section names longer than eight
characters, the normal limit for Coff. By default, these
names are only allowed in object files, as fully-linked
executable images do not carry the Coff string table
required to support the longer names. As a GNU extension, it
is possible to allow their use in executable images as well,
or to (probably pointlessly!) disallow it in object files,
by using these two options. Executable images generated with
these long section names are slightly non-standard, carrying
as they do a string table, and may generate confusing output
when examined with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such as file
viewers and dumpers. However, GDB relies on the use of PE
long section names to find Dwarf-2 debug information
sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if
neither option is specified on the command- line, ld will
enable long section names, overriding the default and
technically correct behaviour, when it finds the presence of
debug information while linking an executable image and not
stripping symbols. [This option is valid for all PE targeted
ports of the linker]</p>

<p>--enable-stdcall-fixup --disable-stdcall-fixup If the
link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt
to do &quot;fuzzy linking&quot; by looking for another
defined symbol that differs only in the format of the symbol
name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will resolve that symbol by
linking to the match. For example, the undefined symbol
&quot;_foo&quot; might be linked to the function
&quot;_foo@12&quot;, or the undefined symbol
&quot;_bar@16&quot; might be linked to the function
&quot;_bar&quot;. When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but
sometimes import libraries generated from third-party dlls
may need this feature to be usable. If you specify
--enable-stdcall-fixup, this feature is fully enabled and
warnings are not printed. If you specify
--disable-stdcall-fixup, this feature is disabled and such
mismatches are considered to be errors. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--export-all-symbols If given, all global symbols in the
objects used to build a DLL will be exported by the DLL.
Note that this is the default if there otherwise wouldnt be
any exported symbols. When symbols are explicitly exported
via DEF files or implicitly exported via function
attributes, the default is to not export anything else
unless this option is given. Note that the symbols
&quot;DllMain@12&quot;, &quot;DllEntryPoint@0&quot;,
&quot;DllMainCRTStartup@12&quot;, and &quot;impure_ptr&quot;
will not be automatically exported. Also, symbols imported
from other DLLs will not be re-exported, nor will symbols
specifying the DLLs internal layout such as those beginning
with &quot;_head_&quot; or ending with &quot;_iname&quot;.
In addition, no symbols from &quot;libgcc&quot;,
&quot;libstd++&quot;, &quot;libmingw32&quot;, or
&quot;crtX.o&quot; will be exported. Symbols whose names
begin with &quot;__rtti_&quot; or &quot;__builtin_&quot;
will not be exported, to help with C++ DLLs. Finally, there
is an extensive list of cygwin- private symbols that are not
exported (obviously, this applies on when building DLLs for
cygwin targets). These cygwin-excludes are:
&quot;_cygwin_dll_entry@12&quot;,
&quot;_cygwin_crt0_common@8&quot;,
&quot;_cygwin_noncygwin_dll_entry@12&quot;,
&quot;_fmode&quot;, &quot;_impure_ptr&quot;,
&quot;cygwin_attach_dll&quot;, &quot;cygwin_premain0&quot;,
&quot;cygwin_premain1&quot;, &quot;cygwin_premain2&quot;,
&quot;cygwin_premain3&quot;, and &quot;environ&quot;. [This
option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
linker]</p>

<p>--exclude-symbols symbol,symbol,... Specifies a list of
symbols which should not be automatically exported. The
symbol names may be delimited by commas or colons. [This
option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
linker]</p>

<p>--file-alignment Specify the file alignment. Sections in
the file will always begin at file offsets which are
multiples of this number. This defaults to 512. [This option
is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--heap reserve --heap reserve,commit Specify the number
of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be
used as heap for this program. The default is 1Mb reserved,
4K committed. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--image-base value Use value as the base address of your
program or dll. This is the lowest memory location that will
be used when your program or dll is loaded. To reduce the
need to relocate and improve performance of your dlls, each
should have a unique base address and not overlap any other
dlls. The default is 0x400000 for executables, and
0x10000000 for dlls. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--kill-at If given, the stdcall suffixes (@nn) will be
stripped from symbols before they are exported. [This option
is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--large-address-aware If given, the appropriate bit in
the &quot;Characteristics&quot; field of the COFF header is
set to indicate that this executable supports virtual
addresses greater than 2 gigabytes. This should be used in
conjunction with the /3GB or /USERVA=value megabytes switch
in the &quot;[operating systems]&quot; section of the
BOOT.INI. Otherwise, this bit has no effect. [This option is
specific to PE targeted ports of the linker]</p>

<p>--major-image-version value Sets the major number of the
&quot;image version&quot;. Defaults to 1. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--major-os-version value Sets the major number of the
&quot;os version&quot;. Defaults to 4. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--major-subsystem-version value Sets the major number of
the &quot;subsystem version&quot;. Defaults to 4. [This
option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
linker]</p>

<p>--minor-image-version value Sets the minor number of the
&quot;image version&quot;. Defaults to 0. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--minor-os-version value Sets the minor number of the
&quot;os version&quot;. Defaults to 0. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--minor-subsystem-version value Sets the minor number of
the &quot;subsystem version&quot;. Defaults to 0. [This
option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
linker]</p>

<p>--output-def file The linker will create the file file
which will contain a DEF file corresponding to the DLL the
linker is generating. This DEF file (which should be called
&quot;*.def&quot;) may be used to create an import library
with &quot;dlltool&quot; or may be used as a reference to
automatically or implicitly exported symbols. [This option
is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--out-implib file The linker will create the file file
which will contain an import lib corresponding to the DLL
the linker is generating. This import lib (which should be
called &quot;*.dll.a&quot; or &quot;*.a&quot; may be used to
link clients against the generated DLL; this behaviour makes
it possible to skip a separate &quot;dlltool&quot; import
library creation step. [This option is specific to the i386
PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--enable-auto-image-base Automatically choose the image
base for DLLs, unless one is specified using the
&quot;--image-base&quot; argument. By using a hash generated
from the dllname to create unique image bases for each DLL,
in-memory collisions and relocations which can delay program
execution are avoided. [This option is specific to the i386
PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--disable-auto-image-base Do not automatically generate
a unique image base. If there is no user-specified image
base (&quot;--image-base&quot;) then use the platform
default. [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted
port of the linker]</p>

<p>--dll-search-prefix string When linking dynamically to a
dll without an import library, search for
&quot;&lt;string&gt;&lt;basename&gt;.dll&quot; in preference
to &quot;lib&lt;basename&gt;.dll&quot;. This behaviour
allows easy distinction between DLLs built for the various
&quot;subplatforms&quot;: native, cygwin, uwin, pw, etc. For
instance, cygwin DLLs typically use
&quot;--dll-search-prefix=cyg&quot;. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--enable-auto-import Do sophisticated linking of
&quot;_symbol&quot; to &quot;__imp__symbol&quot; for DATA
imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols
when building the import libraries with those DATA exports.
Note: Use of the auto-import extension will cause the text
section of the image file to be made writable. This does not
conform to the PE- COFF format specification published by
Microsoft.</p>

<p>Note - use of the auto-import extension will also cause
read only data which would normally be placed into the
.rdata section to be placed into the .data section instead.
This is in order to work around a problem with consts that
is described here:
http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html</p>

<p>Using auto-import generally will just work -- but
sometimes you may see this message:</p>

<p>&quot;variable &lt;var&gt; cant be auto-imported. Please
read the documentation for ld s
&quot;--enable-auto-import&quot; for details.&quot;</p>

<p>This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses
an address ultimately given by the sum of two constants
(Win32 import tables only allow one). Instances where this
may occur include accesses to member fields of struct
variables imported from a DLL, as well as using a constant
index into an array variable imported from a DLL. Any
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may
trigger this error condition. However, regardless of the
exact data type of the offending exported variable, ld will
always detect it, issue the warning, and exit.</p>

<p>There are several ways to address this difficulty,
regardless of the data type of the exported variable:</p>

<p>One way is to use --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch.
This leaves the task of adjusting references in your client
code for runtime environment, so this method works only when
runtime environment supports this feature.</p>

<p>A second solution is to force one of the constants to be
a variable -- that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile
time. For arrays, there are two possibilities: a) make the
indexee (the arrays address) a variable, or b) make the
constant index a variable. Thus:</p>

<p>extern type extern_array[]; extern_array[1] --&gt; {
volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>extern type extern_array[]; extern_array[1] --&gt; {
volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }</p>

<p>For structs (and most other multiword data types) the
only option is to make the struct itself (or the long long,
or the ...) variable:</p>

<p>extern struct s extern_struct; extern_struct.field
--&gt; { volatile struct s *t=&amp;extern_struct;
t-&gt;field }</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>extern long long extern_ll; extern_ll --&gt; { volatile
long long * local_ll=&amp;extern_ll; *local_ll }</p>

<p>A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to
abandon auto-import for the offending symbol and mark it
with &quot;__declspec(dllimport)&quot;. However, in practise
that requires using compile-time #defines to indicate
whether you are building a DLL, building client code that
will link to the DLL, or merely building/linking to a static
library. In making the choice between the various methods of
resolving the direct address with constant offset problem,
you should consider typical real-world usage:</p>

<p>Original:</p>

<p>--foo.h extern int arr[]; --foo.c #include
&quot;foo.h&quot; void main(int argc, char **argv){
printf(&quot;%d0,arr[1]); }</p>

<p>Solution 1:</p>

<p>--foo.h extern int arr[]; --foo.c #include
&quot;foo.h&quot; void main(int argc, char **argv){ /* This
workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not
&quot;optimize&quot; */ volatile int *parr = arr;
printf(&quot;%d0,parr[1]); }</p>

<p>Solution 2:</p>

<p>--foo.h /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no
__declspec(dllexport)) */ #if (defined(_WIN32) ||
defined(__CYGWIN__)) &amp;&amp; !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) ||
defined(FOO_STATIC)) #define FOO_IMPORT
__declspec(dllimport) #else #define FOO_IMPORT #endif extern
FOO_IMPORT int arr[]; --foo.c #include &quot;foo.h&quot;
void main(int argc, char **argv){ printf(&quot;%d0,arr[1]);
}</p>

<p>A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your
library to use a functional interface rather than a data
interface for the offending variables (e.g. set_foo() and
get_foo() accessor functions). [This option is specific to
the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--disable-auto-import Do not attempt to do sophisticated
linking of &quot;_symbol&quot; to &quot;__imp__symbol&quot;
for DATA imports from DLLs. [This option is specific to the
i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc If your code contains
expressions described in --enable-auto-import section, that
is, DATA imports from DLL with non-zero offset, this switch
will create a vector of runtime pseudo relocations which can
be used by runtime environment to adjust references to such
data in your client code. [This option is specific to the
i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--disable-runtime-pseudo-reloc Do not create pseudo
relocations for non-zero offset DATA imports from DLLs. This
is the default. [This option is specific to the i386 PE
targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--enable-extra-pe-debug Show additional debug info
related to auto-import symbol thunking. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--section-alignment Sets the section alignment. Sections
in memory will always begin at addresses which are a
multiple of this number. Defaults to 0x1000. [This option is
specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--stack reserve --stack reserve,commit Specify the
number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally commit)
to be used as stack for this program. The default is 2Mb
reserved, 4K committed. [This option is specific to the i386
PE targeted port of the linker]</p>

<p>--subsystem which --subsystem which:major --subsystem
which:major.minor Specifies the subsystem under which your
program will execute. The legal values for which are
&quot;native&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;,
&quot;console&quot;, &quot;posix&quot;, and
&quot;xbox&quot;. You may optionally set the subsystem
version also. Numeric values are also accepted for which.
[This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the
linker]</p>

<p>The following options set flags in the
&quot;DllCharacteristics&quot; field of the PE file header:
[These options are specific to PE targeted ports of the
linker]</p>

<p>--dynamicbase The image base address may be relocated
using address space layout randomization (ASLR). This
feature was introduced with MS Windows Vista for i386 PE
targets.</p>

<p>--forceinteg Code integrity checks are enforced.</p>

<p>--nxcompat The image is compatible with the Data
Execution Prevention. This feature was introduced with MS
Windows XP SP2 for i386 PE targets.</p>

<p>--no-isolation Although the image understands isolation,
do not isolate the image.</p>

<p>--no-seh The image does not use SEH. No SE handler may
be called from this image.</p>

<p>--no-bind Do not bind this image.</p>

<p>--wdmdriver The driver uses the MS Windows Driver
Model.</p>

<p>--tsaware The image is Terminal Server aware.</p>

<p>The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers support specific options
to control the memory bank switching mapping and trampoline
code generation.</p>

<p>--no-trampoline This option disables the generation of
trampoline. By default a trampoline is generated for each
far function which is called using a &quot;jsr&quot;
instruction (this happens when a pointer to a far function
is taken).</p>

<p>--bank-window name This option indicates to the linker
the name of the memory region in the MEMORY specification
that describes the memory bank window. The definition of
such region is then used by the linker to compute paging and
addresses within the memory window.</p>

<p>The following options are supported to control handling
of GOT generation when linking for 68K targets.</p>

<p>--got=type This option tells the linker which GOT
generation scheme to use. type should be one of single,
negative, multigot or target. For more information refer to
the Info entry for ld.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT You can change the behaviour of ld with the
environment variables &quot;GNUTARGET&quot;,
&quot;LDEMULATION&quot; and
&quot;COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;GNUTARGET&quot; determines the input-file object
format if you dont use -b (or its synonym --format). Its
value should be one of the BFD names for an input format. If
there is no &quot;GNUTARGET&quot; in the environment, ld
uses the natural format of the target. If
&quot;GNUTARGET&quot; is set to &quot;default&quot; then BFD
attempts to discover the input format by examining binary
input files; this method often succeeds, but there are
potential ambiguities, since there is no method of ensuring
that the magic number used to specify object-file formats is
unique. However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each
system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of
convention.</p>

<p>&quot;LDEMULATION&quot; determines the default emulation
if you dont use the -m option. The emulation can affect
various aspects of linker behaviour, particularly the
default linker script. You can list the available emulations
with the --verbose or -V options. If the -m option is not
used, and the &quot;LDEMULATION&quot; environment variable
is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.</p>

<p>Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.
However, if &quot;COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE&quot; is set in the
environment, then it will default to not demangling symbols.
This environment variable is used in a similar fashion by
the &quot;gcc&quot; linker wrapper program. The default may
be overridden by the --demangle and --no-demangle
options.</p>
