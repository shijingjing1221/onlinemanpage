<p>BLK_QUEUE_START_TAG(9) Block Devices
BLK_QUEUE_START_TAG(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_queue_start_tag - find a free tag and assign
it</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int blk_queue_start_tag(struct request_queue *
q, struct request * rq);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q the request queue for the device</p>

<p>rq the block request that needs tagging</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This can either be used as a stand-alone
helper, or possibly be assigned as the queue prep_rq_fn (in
which case struct request automagically gets a tag
assigned). Note that this function assumes that any type of
request can be queued! if this is not true for your device,
you must check the request type before calling this
function. The request will also be removed from the request
queue, so it&acute;s the drivers responsibility to readd it
if it should need to be restarted for some reason.</p>

<p>NOTES queue lock must be held.</p>
