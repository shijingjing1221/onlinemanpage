<p>NAME xcb-examples - manpage examples</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Many of the XCB manpages contain example
code. These examples intend to explain how to use one
particular part of XCB. They almost never repre- sent a
standalone (or even useful) program - X11 programs are rela-
tively involved and thus beyond the scope of a manpage
example.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Every example assumes you have an
xcb_connection and possibly other variables at hand. For
illustrating how xcb_get_property works, you need the window
of which you want to get the property, for example. To make
it clear that these variables are your responsibility, these
exam- ples consist of a single function which takes the
necessary variables as parameters.</p>

<p>FLUSHING Flushing means calling xcb_flush to clear the
XCB-internal write buffer and send all pending requests to
the X11 server. You don t explicitly need to flush before
using a reply function (like xcb_query_pointer_reply), but
you do need to flush before entering the event loop of your
program.</p>

<p>There are only two cases when XCB flushes by itself. The
first case is when its write buffer becomes full, the second
case is when you are asking for the reply of a request which
wasnt flushed out yet (like xcb_query_pointer_reply). This
last point also includes xcb_request_check(). Please note
that waiting for an event does NOT flush.</p>

<p>Examples generally include the xcb_flush call where
appropriate (for example after setting a property).
Therefore, including these functions and calling them in
your application should just work. However, you might get
better results when flushing outside of the function,
depend- ing on the architecture of your program.</p>

<p>COMPILATION If an example does not compile (without
warnings) when using -std=c99, that is considered a
documentation bug. Similarly, not handling errors or leaking
memory is also considered a documentation bug. Please inform
us about it on xcb@lists.freedesktop.org.</p>

<p>CODING STYLE Every example uses 4 spaces for
indentation.</p>

<p>Comments are in asterisks, like /* this */.</p>

<p>No line is longer than 80 characters (including
indentation).</p>
