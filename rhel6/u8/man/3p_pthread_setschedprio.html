<p>PTHREAD_SETSCHEDPRIO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SETSCHEDPRIO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_setschedprio - dynamic thread scheduling
parameters access (REALTIME THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_setschedprio(pthread_t thread, int
prio);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_setschedprio() function shall
set the scheduling priority for the thread whose thread ID
is given by thread to the value given by prio. See
Scheduling Policies for a description on how this function
call affects the ordering of the thread in the thread list
for its new priority.</p>

<p>If the pthread_setschedprio() function fails, the
scheduling priority of the target thread shall not be
changed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_setschedprio()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_setschedprio() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of prio is invalid for the scheduling
policy of the specified thread.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP An attempt was made to set the priority to an
unsupported value.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller does not have the appropriate
permission to set the scheduling policy of the specified
thread.</p>

<p>EPERM The implementation does not allow the application
to modify the priority to the value specified.</p>

<p>ESRCH The value specified by thread does not refer to an
existing thread.</p>

<p>The pthread_setschedprio() function shall not return an
error code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pthread_setschedprio() function provides a
way for an application to temporarily raise its priority and
then lower it again, without having the undesired side
effect of yielding to other threads of the same priority.
This is necessary if the application is to implement its own
strategies for bounding priority inversion, such as priority
inher- itance or priority ceilings. This capability is
especially important if the implementation does not support
the Thread Priority Protection or Thread Priority
Inheritance options, but even if those options are supported
it is needed if the application is to bound priority inheri-
tance for other resources, such as semaphores.</p>

<p>The standard developers considered that while it might
be preferable conceptually to solve this problem by
modifying the specification of pthread_setschedparam(), it
was too late to make such a change, as there may be
implementations that would need to be changed. Therefore,
this new function was introduced.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
