<p>NAME glutWarpPointer - Moves the mouse pointer to given
window coordinates.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutWarpPointer(int x, int y);</p>

<p>PARAMETERS x Window X coord for mouse.</p>

<p>y Window Y coord for mouse.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION glutWarpPointer() moves the mouse pointer to
window-relative coordinates given by x and y.</p>

<p>CAVEATS x and y are relative to current window.</p>

<p>Not applicable for GLUT_OFFSCREEN windows.</p>

<p>Warping means moving, just as if the user had manually
moved the mouse. This can generate mouse-motion callbacks.
If your callback then moves the pointer again, you may end
up in an endless loop. There is some discus- sion about
changing this, but at present this is just a caveat for you,
the user, to be aware of.</p>
