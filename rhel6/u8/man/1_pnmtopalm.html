<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtopalm reads a PNM image as input, from Standard
Input or pnmfile and produces a Palm Bitmap as output.</p>

<p>Palm Bitmap files are either grayscale files 1, 2, or 4
bits wide, or color files 8 bits wide, so pnmtopalm
automatically scales colors to have an appropriate maxval,
unless you specify a depth or max depth. Input files must
have an appropriate number and set of colors for the
selected output constraints.</p>

<p>This often means that you should run the PNM image
through pnmquant or pnmremap before you pass it to
pnmtopalm. Netpbm comes with several colormap files you can
use with pnmremap for this purpose. They are palmgray2.map
(4 shades of gray for a depth of 2), palmgray4.map (16
shades of gray for a depth of 4), and palmcolor8.map (232
colors in default Palm colormap). In a standard Netpbm
installation, these are in the Netpbm data directory, and
you can find the Netpbm data direc- tory with a
netpbm-config --datadir shell command.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>pnmremap myimage.ppm -mapfile=$(netpbm-config
--datadir)/palmgray2.map | pnmtopalm -depth=2
&gt;myimage.palm</p>

<p>Palm Bitmap Version pnmtopalm generates a Version 0, 1,
2, or 3 Palm Bitmap. It generates the oldest (lowest)
version it can for the given image and the options you
specify.</p>

<p>&middot; If you specify a density (-density option)
higher than low, the version is at least 3.</p>

<p>&middot; If you specify transparency (-transparent
option) or any com- pression, the version is at least 2.</p>

<p>&middot; If you specify a custom colormap (-colormap
option), the verison is at least 1.</p>

<p>&middot; If the image has more than one bit per pixel,
the version is at least 1. The image has more than one bit
per pixel if you spec- ify it with -depth or if you let it
default and the image has more than two colors (or shades of
gray).</p>

<p>All releases of Palm OS can read a Version 0 bitmap.
Palm OS 3.0 and later can read a Version 1 bitmap. Palm OS
3.5 and later can read a Version 2 bitmap. To read a Version
3 bitmap, you need Palm OS Garnet or a handheld running the
High Density Display Feature Set.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -verbose Display the format of the output
file.</p>

<p>-depth=N Produce a file of depth N, where N must be
either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. Because the default Palm 8-bit
colormap is not grayscale, if the input is a grayscale or
monochrome image, the output will never be more than 4 bits
deep, regardless of the specified depth. Note that 8-bit
color works only in PalmOS 3.5 (and higher), and 16-bit
direct color works only in PalmOS 4.0 (and higher). However,
the 16-bit direct color format is also com- patible with the
various PalmOS 3.x versions used in the Hand- spring Visor,
so these images may also work in that device.</p>

<p>-maxdepth=N Produce a file of minimal depth, but in any
case less than N bits wide. If you specify 16-bit, the
output will always be 16-bit direct color.</p>

<p>-offset Set the nextDepthOffset field in the palm file
header to indi- cate the end of the file (and pad the end of
the file to 4 bytes, since nextDepthOffset can point only to
4 byte bound- aries).</p>

<p>A palm image file can contain multiple renditions of the
same image, with different color depths, so a viewer can
choose one appropriate for the display. The nextDepthOffset
field tells where in the stream the next rendition
begins.</p>

<p>pnmtopalm creates a file that contains only one image,
but you can separately concatenate multiple one-image files
to create a multi-image file. If you do that, youll need to
use -offset so that the resulting concatenation is a correct
stream.</p>

<p>By default (if you dont specify -offset), pnmtopalm
generates a nextDepthOffset field that says there is no
following image (and does not add any padding after the
image).</p>

<p>Version 3 Palm Bitmaps actually have a nextBitmapOffset
field instead of the nextDepthOffset. The foregoing applies
to whichever is relevant.</p>

<p>The -offset option was new in Netpbm 10.26 (January
2005). Before that, pnmtopalm always set the nextDepthOffset
field to none.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), you cannot use -offset
if you create a compressed raster (because pnmtopalm isn t
smart enough to be able to know the size of the image at the
time it writes the header). You also cannot use it with 16
bit color depth or with the -colormap option, for much the
same reason.</p>

<p>-withdummy This option tells pnmtopalm to put in the
stream, after after the image, a dummy image header to
introduce subsequent high density images.</p>

<p>This dummy image header is a special sequence specified
in Palm Bitmap specifications. It looks to an older Palm
Bitmap inter- preter like an invalid image header, so such
an intepreter will stop reading the stream there. But a new
Palm Bitmap inter- preter recognizes it for what it is (just
something to choke an old interpreter) and skips over it.
Presumably, you will add to the stream after this high
density images which would confuse an older interpreter.</p>

<p>If you specify -withdummy, you must also specify
-offset, since it doesnt make any sense otherwise.</p>

<p>-withdummy was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>-colormap Build a custom colormap and include it in the
output file. This is not recommended by Palm, for efficiency
reasons. Otherwise, pnmtopalm uses the default Palm colormap
for color output.</p>

<p>-transparent=color Marks one particular color as fully
transparent. The format to specify the color is either (when
for example orange) 1.0,0.5,0.0 , where the values are
floats between zero and one, or with the syntax #RGB,
#RRGGBB or #RRRRGGGGBBBB where R, G and B are hexadecimal
numbers. Transparency works only on Palm OS 3.5 and
higher.</p>

<p>-scanline-compression Specifies that the output Palm
bitmap will use the Palm scanline compression scheme.
Scanline compression works only in Palm OS 2.0 and
higher.</p>

<p>-rle-compression Specifies that the output Palm bitmap
will use the Palm RLE com- pression scheme. RLE compression
works only with Palm OS 3.5 and higher.</p>

<p>-packbits-compression Specifies that the output Palm
bitmap will use the Palm packbits compression scheme.
Packbits compression works only with Palm OS 4.0 and
higher.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).</p>

<p>-density=N This specifies the Palm Bitmap density. The
density is a number that is proportional to the resolution
the image should have when displayed. The proportionality
factor is up to whatever is doing the displaying, but its
helpful to think of these numbers as being pixels per inch.
The allowable values are:</p>

<p>&middot; 72</p>

<p>&middot; 108</p>

<p>&middot; 144</p>

<p>&middot; 216</p>

<p>&middot; 288</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005).
Earlier Netpbm could not generate Version 3 Palm Bitmaps, so
there was no such thing as density.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO palmtopnm(1), pnmquant(1), pnmremap(1),
pnm(1)</p>

<p>NOTES Palm Bitmaps may contains multiple renditions of
the same bitmap, in different depths. To construct an
N-multiple-rendition Palm Bitmap with pnmtopalm, first
construct renditions 1 through N-1 using the -offset option,
then construct the Nth image without the -offset option.
Then concatenate the individual renditions together in a
sin- gle file using cat.</p>

<p>If you will include both high density and low density
renditions, put the high density images last and when you
create the last of the low density images, use the
-withdummy option.</p>
