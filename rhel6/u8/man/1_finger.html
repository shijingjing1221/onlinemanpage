<p>FINGER(1) BSD General Commands Manual FINGER(1)</p>

<p>NAME finger - user information lookup program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS finger [-lmsp] [user ...] [user@host ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The finger displays information about the
system users.</p>

<p>Options are:</p>

<p>-s Finger displays the user s login name, real name,
terminal name and write status (as a * after the terminal
name if write permis- sion is denied), idle time, login
time, office location and office phone number.</p>

<p>Login time is displayed as month, day, hours and
minutes, unless more than six months ago, in which case the
year is displayed rather than the hours and minutes.</p>

<p>Unknown devices as well as nonexistent idle and login
times are displayed as single asterisks.</p>

<p>-l Produces a multi-line format displaying all of the
information described for the -s option as well as the users
home directory, home phone number, login shell, mail status,
and the contents of the files .plan, .project, .pgpkey and
.forward from the users home directory.</p>

<p>Phone numbers specified as eleven digits are printed as
+N-NNN- NNN-NNNN . Numbers specified as ten or seven digits
are printed as the appropriate subset of that string.
Numbers specified as five digits are printed as xN-NNNN.
Numbers specified as four digits are printed as xNNNN.</p>

<p>If write permission is denied to the device, the phrase
(messages off) is appended to the line containing the device
name. One entry per user is displayed with the -l option; if
a user is logged on multiple times, terminal information is
repeated once per login.</p>

<p>Mail status is shown as No Mail. if there is no mail at
all, Mail last read DDD MMM ## HH:MM YYYY (TZ) if the person
has looked at their mailbox since new mail arriving, or New
mail received ... , Unread since ... if they have new
mail.</p>

<p>-p Prevents the -l option of finger from displaying the
contents of the .plan, .project and .pgpkey files.</p>

<p>-m Prevent matching of user names. User is usually a
login name; how- ever, matching will also be done on the
users real names, unless the -m option is supplied. All name
matching performed by finger is case insensitive.</p>

<p>If no options are specified, finger defaults to the -l
style output if operands are provided, otherwise to the -s
style. Note that some fields may be missing, in either
format, if information is not available for them.</p>

<p>If no arguments are specified, finger will print an
entry for each user currently logged into the system.</p>

<p>Finger may be used to look up users on a remote machine.
The format is to specify a user as user@host, or @host,
where the default output format for the former is the -l
style, and the default output format for the latter is the
-s style. The -l option is the only option that may be
passed to a remote machine.</p>

<p>If standard output is a socket, finger will emit a
carriage return (^M) before every linefeed (^J). This is for
processing remote finger requests when invoked by
fingerd(8).</p>

<p>FILES ~/.nofinger If finger finds this file in a user s
home directory, it will, for finger requests originating
outside the local host, firmly deny the existence of that
user. For this to work, the finger program, as started by
fingerd(8), must be able to see the .nofinger file. This
generally means that the home directory containing the file
must have the other-users-execute bit set (o+x). See
chmod(1). If you use this feature for privacy, please test
it with finger @localhost before relying on it, just in
case.</p>

<p>~/.plan</p>

<p>~/.project</p>

<p>~/.pgpkey These files are printed as part of a
long-format request. The .project file is limited to one
line; the .plan file may be arbitrarily long.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO chfn(1), passwd(1), w(1), who(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY The finger command appeared in 3.0BSD.</p>
