<p>LDAP_SEARCH(3) LDAP_SEARCH(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_search, ldap_search_s, ldap_search_st,
ldap_search_ext, ldap_search_ext_s - Perform an LDAP search
operation</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_search_ext( LDAP *ld, char *base, int scope,
char *filter, char *attrs[], int attrsonly, LDAPControl
**serverctrls, LDAPControl **clientctrls, struct timeval
*timeout, int sizelimit, int *msgidp );</p>

<p>int ldap_search_ext_s( LDAP *ld, char *base, int scope,
char *filter, char *attrs[], int attrsonly, LDAPControl
**serverctrls, LDAPControl **clientctrls, struct timeval
*timeout, int sizelimit, LDAPMessage **res );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These routines are used to perform LDAP
search operations. The ldap_search_ext_s() routine does the
search synchronously (i.e., not returning until the
operation completes), providing a pointer to the resulting
LDAP messages at the location pointed to by the res parame-
ter.</p>

<p>The ldap_search_ext() routine is the asynchronous
version, initiating the search and returning the message id
of the operation it initiated in the integer pointed to by
the msgidp parameter.</p>

<p>The base parameter is the DN of the entry at which to
start the search.</p>

<p>The scope parameter is the scope of the search and
should be one of LDAP_SCOPE_BASE, to search the object
itself, LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL, to search the object s
immediate children, LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, to search the object
and all its descendants, or LDAP_SCOPE_CHILDREN, to search
all of the descendants. Note that the latter requires the
server sup- port the LDAP Subordinates Search Scope
extension.</p>

<p>The filter is a string representation of the filter to
apply in the search. The string should conform to the format
specified in RFC 4515 as extended by RFC 4526. For instance,
&quot;(cn=Jane Doe)&quot;. Note that use of the extension
requires the server to support the LDAP Absolute True/False
Filter extension. NULL may be specified to indicate the
library should send the filter (objectClass=*).</p>

<p>The attrs parameter is a null-terminated array of
attribute descrip- tions to return from matching entries. If
NULL is specified, the return of all user attributes is
requested. The description &quot;*&quot;
(LDAP_ALL_USER_ATTRIBUTES) may be used to request all user
attributes to be returned. The description
&quot;+&quot;(LDAP_ALL_OPERATIONAL_ATTRIBUTES) may be used
to request all operational attributes to be returned. Note
that this requires the server to support the LDAP All
Operational Attribute extension. To request no attributes,
the description &quot;1.1&quot; (LDAP_NO_ATTRS) should be
listed by itself.</p>

<p>The attrsonly parameter should be set to a non-zero
value if only attribute descriptions are wanted. It should
be set to zero (0) if both attributes descriptions and
attribute values are wanted.</p>

<p>The serverctrls and clientctrls parameters may be used
to specify server and client controls, respectively.</p>

<p>The ldap_search_ext_s() routine is the synchronous
version of ldap_search_ext().</p>

<p>It also returns a code indicating success or, in the
case of failure, indicating the nature of the failure of the
operation. See ldap_error(3) for details.</p>

<p>NOTES Note that both read and list functionality are
subsumed by these rou- tines, by using a filter like
&quot;(objectclass=*)&quot; and a scope of LDAP_SCOPE_BASE
(to emulate read) or LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL (to emulate
list).</p>

<p>These routines may dynamically allocate memory. The
caller is responsi- ble for freeing such memory using
supplied deallocation routines. Return values are contained
in &lt;ldap.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Note that res parameter of ldap_search_ext_s() and
ldap_search_s() should be freed with ldap_msgfree()
regardless of return value of these functions.</p>

<p>DEPRECATED INTERFACES The ldap_search() routine is
deprecated in favor of the ldap_search_ext() routine. The
ldap_search_s() and ldap_search_st() routines are deprecated
in favor of the ldap_search_ext_s() routine.</p>

<p>Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library.
The macro LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value
(e.g., -DLDAP_DEPRE- CATED=1) when compiling program
designed to use deprecated interfaces. It is recommended
that developers writing new programs, or updating old
programs, avoid use of deprecated interfaces. Over time, it
is expected that documentation (and, eventually, support)
for deprecated interfaces to be eliminated.</p>
