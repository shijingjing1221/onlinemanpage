<p>UNLINK(2) Linux Programmer s Manual UNLINK(2)</p>

<p>NAME unlink - delete a name and possibly the file it
refers to</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int unlink(const char *pathname);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION unlink() deletes a name from the file
system. If that name was the last link to a file and no
processes have the file open the file is deleted and the
space it was using is made available for reuse.</p>

<p>If the name was the last link to a file but any
processes still have the file open the file will remain in
existence until the last file descriptor referring to it is
closed.</p>

<p>If the name referred to a symbolic link the link is
removed.</p>

<p>If the name referred to a socket, fifo or device the
name for it is removed but processes which have the object
open may continue to use it.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Write access to the directory containing
pathname is not allowed for the processs effective UID, or
one of the directories in pathname did not allow search
permission. (See also path_reso- lution(7).)</p>

<p>EBUSY (not on Linux) The file pathname cannot be
unlinked because it is being used by the system or another
process and the implementation considers this an error.</p>

<p>EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>EISDIR pathname refers to a directory. (This is the
non-POSIX value returned by Linux since 2.1.132.)</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
translating path- name.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG pathname was too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component in pathname does not exist or is a
dangling symbolic link, or pathname is empty.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in pathname is
not, in fact, a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The system does not allow unlinking of
directories, or unlinking of directories requires privileges
that the calling process doesn t have. (This is the POSIX
prescribed error return; as noted above, Linux returns
EISDIR for this case.)</p>

<p>EPERM (Linux only) The file system does not allow
unlinking of files.</p>

<p>EPERM or EACCES The directory containing pathname has
the sticky bit (S_ISVTX) set and the processs effective UID
is neither the UID of the file to be deleted nor that of the
directory containing it, and the process is not privileged
(Linux: does not have the CAP_FOWNER capability).</p>

<p>EROFS pathname refers to a file on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can
cause the unexpected disappearance of files which are still
being used.</p>
