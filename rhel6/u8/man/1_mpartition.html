<p>Name mpartition - partition an MSDOS hard disk</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mpartition command is used to create
MS-DOS filesystems as parti- tions. This is intended to be
used on non-Linux systems, i.e. systems where fdisk and easy
access to Scsi devices are not available. This command only
works on drives whose partition variable is set.</p>

<p>mpartition -p drive mpartition -r drive mpartition -I
[-B bootSector] drive mpartition -a drive mpartition -d
drive mpartition -c [-s sectors] [-h heads] [-t cylinders]
[-v [-T type] [-b begin] [-l length] [-f]</p>

<p>Mpartition supports the following operations:</p>

<p>p Prints a command line to recreate the partition for
the drive. Nothing is printed if the partition for the drive
is not defined, or an inconsistency has been detected. If
verbose (-v) is also set, prints the current partition
table.</p>

<p>r Removes the partition described by drive.</p>

<p>I Initializes the partition table, and removes all
partitions.</p>

<p>c Creates the partition described by drive.</p>

<p>a &quot;Activates&quot; the partition, i.e. makes it
bootable. Only one partition can be bootable at a time.</p>

<p>d &quot;Desactivates&quot; the partition, i.e. makes it
unbootable.</p>

<p>If no operation is given, the current settings are
printed.</p>

<p>For partition creations, the following options are
available:</p>

<p>s sectors The number of sectors per track of the
partition (which is also the number of sectors per track for
the whole drive).</p>

<p>h heads The number of heads of the partition (which is
also the number of heads for the whole drive). By default,
the geometry infor- mation (number of sectors and heads) is
figured out from neigh- bouring partition table entries, or
guessed from the size.</p>

<p>t cylinders The number of cylinders of the partition
(not the number of cylinders of the whole drive.</p>

<p>b begin The starting offset of the partition, expressed
in sectors. If begin is not given, mpartition lets the
partition begin at the start of the disk (partition number
1), or immediately after the end of the previous
partition.</p>

<p>l length The size (length) of the partition, expressed
in sectors. If end is not given, mpartition figures out the
size from the num- ber of sectors, heads and cylinders. If
these are not given either, it gives the partition the
biggest possible size, con- sidering disk size and start of
the next partition.</p>

<p>The following option is available for all operation
which modify the partition table:</p>

<p>f Usually, before writing back any changes to the
partition, mpar- tition performs certain consistenct checks,
such as checking for overlaps and proper alignment of the
partitions. If any of these checks fails, the partition
table is not changes. The -f allows you to override these
safeguards.</p>

<p>The following options are available for all
operations:</p>

<p>v Together with -p prints the partition table as it is
now (no change operation), or as it is after it is
modified.</p>

<p>vv If the verbosity flag is given twice, mpartition will
print out a hexdump of the partition table when reading it
from and writ- ing it to the device.</p>

<p>The following option is available for partition table
initialization:</p>

<p>B bootSector Reads the template master boot record from
file bootSector.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
