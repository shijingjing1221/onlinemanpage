<p>PERLOS2(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLOS2(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlos2 - Perl under OS/2, DOS, Win0.3*, Win0.95
and WinNT.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS One can read this document in the following
formats:</p>

<p>man perlos2 view perl perlos2 explorer perlos2.html info
perlos2</p>

<p>to list some (not all may be available simultaneously),
or it may be read as is: either as README.os2, or
pod/perlos2.pod.</p>

<p>To read the .INF version of documentation (very
recommended) outside of OS/2, one needs an IBMs reader (may
be available on IBM ftp sites (?) (URL anyone?)) or shipped
with PC DOS 7.0 and IBMs Visual Age C++ 3.5.</p>

<p>A copy of a Win* viewer is contained in the &quot;Just
add OS/2 Warp&quot; package</p>


<p>ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/os2/tools/jaow/jaow.zip</p>

<p>in ?:JUST_ADDview.exe. This gives one an access to EMXs
.INF docs as well (text form is available in /emx/doc in EMX
s distribution). There is also a different viewer named
xview.</p>

<p>Note that if you have lynx.exe or netscape.exe
installed, you can follow WWW links from this document in
.INF format. If you have EMX docs installed correctly, you
can follow library links (you need to have &quot;view
emxbook&quot; working by setting &quot;EMXBOOK&quot;
environment variable as it is described in EMX docs).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Target The target is to make OS/2 one of the
best supported platform for using/building/developing Perl
and Perl applications, as well as make Perl the best
language to use under OS/2. The secondary target is to try
to make this work under DOS and Win* as well (but not too
hard).</p>

<p>The current state is quite close to this target. Known
limitations:</p>

<p>&middot; Some *nix programs use fork() a lot; with the
mostly useful flavors of perl for OS/2 (there are several
built simultaneously) this is supported; but some flavors do
not support this (e.g., when Perl is called from inside
REXX). Using fork() after useing dynamically loading
extensions would not work with very old versions of EMX.</p>

<p>&middot; You need a separate perl executable perl__.exe
(see perl__.exe) if you want to use PM code in your
application (as Perl/Tk or OpenGL Perl modules do) without
having a text-mode window present.</p>

<p>While using the standard perl.exe from a text-mode
window is possible too, I have seen cases when this causes
degradation of the system stability. Using perl__.exe avoids
such a degradation.</p>

<p>&middot; There is no simple way to access WPS objects.
The only way I know is via &quot;OS2::REXX&quot; and
&quot;SOM&quot; extensions (see OS2::REXX, Som). However, we
do not have access to convenience methods of Object- REXX.
(Is it possible at all? I know of no Object-REXX API.) The
&quot;SOM&quot; extension (currently in alpha-text) may
eventually remove this shortcoming; however, due to the fact
that DII is not supported by the &quot;SOM&quot; module,
using &quot;SOM&quot; is not as convenient as one would like
it.</p>

<p>Please keep this list up-to-date by informing me about
other items.</p>

<p>Other OSes Since OS/2 port of perl uses a remarkable EMX
environment, it can run (and build extensions, and -
possibly - be built itself) under any environment which can
run EMX. The current list is DOS, DOS-inside-OS/2, Win0.3*,
Win0.95 and WinNT. Out of many perl flavors, only one works,
see &quot;perl_.exe&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that not all features of Perl are available under
these environments. This depends on the features the
extender - most probably RSX - decided to implement.</p>

<p>Cf. Prerequisites.</p>

<p>Prerequisites EMX EMX runtime is required (may be
substituted by RSX). Note that it is possible to make
perl_.exe to run under DOS without any external support by
binding emx.exe/rsx.exe to it, see emxbind. Note that under
DOS for best results one should use RSX runtime, which has
much more functions working (like &quot;fork&quot;,
&quot;popen&quot; and so on). In fact RSX is required if
there is no VCPI present. Note the RSX requires DPMI. Many
implementations of DPMI are known to be very buggy,
beware!</p>

<p>Only the latest runtime is supported, currently
&quot;0.9d fix 03&quot;. Perl may run under earlier versions
of EMX, but this is not tested.</p>

<p>One can get different parts of EMX from, say</p>

<p>http://www.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/
http://powerusersbbs.com/pub/os2/dev/ [EMX+GCC Development]
http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d/</p>

<p>The runtime component should have the name
emxrt.zip.</p>

<p>NOTE. When using emx.exe/rsx.exe, it is enough to have
them on your path. One does not need to specify them
explicitly (though this</p>

<p>emx perl_.exe -de 0</p>

<p>will work as well.)</p>

<p>RSX To run Perl on DPMI platforms one needs RSX runtime.
This is needed under DOS-inside-OS/2, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and
WinNT (see &quot;Other OSes&quot;). RSX would not work with
VCPI only, as EMX would, it requires DMPI.</p>

<p>Having RSX and the latest sh.exe one gets a fully
functional *nix-ish environment under DOS, say,
&quot;fork&quot;, &quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; and
pipe-&quot;open&quot; work. In fact, MakeMaker works (for
static build), so one can have Perl development environment
under DOS.</p>

<p>One can get RSX from, say</p>

<p>ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/emx09c/contrib
ftp://ftp.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/systems/msdos/misc
ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/devtools/emx+gcc/contrib</p>

<p>Contact the author on
&quot;rainer@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de&quot;.</p>

<p>The latest sh.exe with DOS hooks is available in</p>

<p>http://www.ilyaz.org/software/os2/</p>

<p>as sh_dos.zip or under similar names starting with
&quot;sh&quot;, &quot;pdksh&quot; etc.</p>

<p>HPFS Perl does not care about file systems, but the perl
library contains many files with long names, so to install
it intact one needs a file system which supports long file
names.</p>

<p>Note that if you do not plan to build the perl itself,
it may be possible to fool EMX to truncate file names. This
is not supported, read EMX docs to see how to do it.</p>

<p>pdksh To start external programs with complicated
command lines (like with pipes in between, and/or quoting of
arguments), Perl uses an external shell. With EMX port such
shell should be named sh.exe, and located either in the
wired-in-during-compile locations (usually F:/bin), or in
configurable location (see &quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;).</p>

<p>For best results use EMX pdksh. The standard binary
(5.2.14 or later) runs under DOS (with RSX) as well, see</p>

<p>http://www.ilyaz.org/software/os2/</p>

<p>Starting Perl programs under OS/2 (and DOS and...) Start
your Perl program foo.pl with arguments &quot;arg1 arg2
arg3&quot; the same way as on any other platform, by</p>

<p>perl foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3</p>

<p>If you want to specify perl options &quot;-my_opts&quot;
to the perl itself (as opposed to your program), use</p>

<p>perl -my_opts foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3</p>

<p>Alternately, if you use OS/2-ish shell, like CMD or
4os2, put the following at the start of your perl
script:</p>

<p>extproc perl -S -my_opts</p>

<p>rename your program to foo.cmd, and start it by
typing</p>

<p>foo arg1 arg2 arg3</p>

<p>Note that because of stupid OS/2 limitations the full
path of the perl script is not available when you use
&quot;extproc&quot;, thus you are forced to use
&quot;-S&quot; perl switch, and your script should be on the
&quot;PATH&quot;. As a plus side, if you know a full path to
your script, you may still start it with</p>

<p>perl ../../blah/foo.cmd arg1 arg2 arg3</p>

<p>(note that the argument &quot;-my_opts&quot; is taken
care of by the &quot;extproc&quot; line in your script, see
&quot;&quot;extproc&quot; on the first line&quot;).</p>

<p>To understand what the above magic does, read perl docs
about &quot;-S&quot; switch - see perlrun, and cmdref about
&quot;extproc&quot;:</p>

<p>view perl perlrun man perlrun view cmdref extproc help
extproc</p>

<p>or whatever method you prefer.</p>

<p>There are also endless possibilities to use executable
extensions of 4os2, associations of WPS and so on...
However, if you use *nixish shell (like sh.exe supplied in
the binary distribution), you need to follow the syntax
specified in &quot;Switches&quot; in perlrun.</p>

<p>Note that -S switch supports scripts with additional
extensions .cmd, .btm, .bat, .pl as well.</p>

<p>Starting OS/2 (and DOS) programs under Perl This is what
system() (see &quot;system&quot; in perlfunc),
&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; (see &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in
perlop), and open pipe (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc)
are for. (Avoid exec() (see &quot;exec&quot; in perlfunc)
unless you know what you do).</p>

<p>Note however that to use some of these operators you
need to have a sh- syntax shell installed (see
&quot;Pdksh&quot;, &quot;Frequently asked questions&quot;),
and perl should be able to find it (see
&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;).</p>

<p>The cases when the shell is used are:</p>

<p>1. One-argument system() (see &quot;system&quot; in
perlfunc), exec() (see &quot;exec&quot; in perlfunc) with
redirection or shell meta-characters;</p>

<p>2. Pipe-open (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc) with the
command which contains redirection or shell
meta-characters;</p>

<p>3. Backticks &quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; (see &quot;I/O
Operators&quot; in perlop) with the command which contains
redirection or shell meta-characters;</p>

<p>4. If the executable called by
system()/exec()/pipe-open()/&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; is a
script with the &quot;magic&quot; &quot;#!&quot; line or
&quot;extproc&quot; line which specifies shell;</p>

<p>5. If the executable called by
system()/exec()/pipe-open()/&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; is a
script without &quot;magic&quot; line, and $ENV{EXECSHELL}
is set to shell;</p>

<p>6. If the executable called by
system()/exec()/pipe-open()/&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; is
not found (is not this remark obsolete?);</p>

<p>7. For globbing (see &quot;glob&quot; in perlfunc,
&quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop) (obsolete? Perl uses
builtin globbing nowadays...).</p>

<p>For the sake of speed for a common case, in the above
algorithms backslashes in the command name are not
considered as shell metacharacters.</p>

<p>Perl starts scripts which begin with cookies
&quot;extproc&quot; or &quot;#!&quot; directly, without an
intervention of shell. Perl uses the same algorithm to find
the executable as pdksh: if the path on &quot;#!&quot; line
does not work, and contains &quot;/&quot;, then the
directory part of the executable is ignored, and the
executable is searched in . and on &quot;PATH&quot;. To find
arguments for these scripts Perl uses a different algorithm
than pdksh: up to 3 arguments are recognized, and trailing
whitespace is stripped.</p>

<p>If a script does not contain such a cooky, then to avoid
calling sh.exe, Perl uses the same algorithm as pdksh: if
$ENV{EXECSHELL} is set, the script is given as the first
argument to this command, if not set, then
&quot;$ENV{COMSPEC} /c&quot; is used (or a hardwired guess
if $ENV{COMSPEC} is not set).</p>

<p>When starting scripts directly, Perl uses exactly the
same algorithm as for the search of script given by -S
command-line option: it will look in the current directory,
then on components of $ENV{PATH} using the following order
of appended extensions: no extension, .cmd, .btm, .bat,
.pl.</p>

<p>Note that Perl will start to look for scripts only if
OS/2 cannot start the specified application, thus
&quot;system &rsquo;blah&rsquo;&quot; will not look for a
script if there is an executable file blah.exe anywhere on
&quot;PATH&quot;. In other words, &quot;PATH&quot; is
essentially searched twice: once by the OS for an
executable, then by Perl for scripts.</p>

<p>Note also that executable files on OS/2 can have an
arbitrary extension, but .exe will be automatically appended
if no dot is present in the name. The workaround is as
simple as that: since blah. and blah denote the same file
(at list on FAT and HPFS file systems), to start an
executable residing in file n:/bin/blah (no extension) give
an argument &quot;n:/bin/blah.&quot; (dot appended) to
system().</p>

<p>Perl will start PM programs from VIO (=text-mode) Perl
process in a separate PM session; the opposite is not true:
when you start a non-PM program from a PM Perl process, Perl
would not run it in a separate session. If a separate
session is desired, either ensure that shell will be used,
as in &quot;system &rsquo;cmd /c myprog&rsquo;&quot;, or
start it using optional arguments to system() documented in
&quot;OS2::Process&quot; module. This is considered to be a
feature.</p>

<p>Frequently asked questions &quot;It does not work&quot;
Perl binary distributions come with a testperl.cmd script
which tries to detect common problems with misconfigured
installations. There is a pretty large chance it will
discover which step of the installation you managed to goof.
&quot;;-)&quot;</p>

<p>I cannot run external programs &middot; Did you run your
programs with &quot;-w&quot; switch? See &quot;2 (and DOS)
programs under Perl&quot; in Starting OS.</p>

<p>&middot; Do you try to run internal shell commands, like
&quot;&lsquo;copy a b&lsquo;&quot; (internal for cmd.exe),
or &quot;&lsquo;glob a*b&lsquo;&quot; (internal for ksh)?
You need to specify your shell explicitly, like
&quot;&lsquo;cmd /c copy a b&lsquo;&quot;, since Perl cannot
deduce which commands are internal to your shell.</p>

<p>I cannot embed perl into my program, or use perl.dll
from my program. Is your program EMX-compiled with
&quot;-Zmt -Zcrtdll&quot;? Well, nowadays Perl DLL should be
usable from a differently compiled program too... If you can
run Perl code from REXX scripts (see OS2::REXX), then there
are some other aspect of interaction which are overlooked by
the current hackish code to support differently-compiled
principal programs.</p>

<p>If everything else fails, you need to build a
stand-alone DLL for perl. Contact me, I did it once. Sockets
would not work, as a lot of other stuff.</p>

<p>Did you use ExtUtils::Embed? Some time ago I had reports
it does not work. Nowadays it is checked in the Perl test
suite, so grep ./t subdirectory of the build tree (as well
as *.t files in the ./lib subdirectory) to find how it
should be done &quot;correctly&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot; and pipe-&quot;open&quot; do
not work under DOS. This may a variant of just &quot;I
cannot run external programs&quot;, or a deeper problem.
Basically: you need RSX (see &quot;Prerequisites&quot;) for
these commands to work, and you may need a port of sh.exe
which understands command arguments. One of such ports is
listed in &quot;Prerequisites&quot; under RSX. Do not forget
to set variable &quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot; as well.</p>

<p>DPMI is required for RSX.</p>

<p>Cannot start &quot;find.exe &quot;pattern&quot;
file&quot; The whole idea of the &quot;standard C API to
start applications&quot; is that the forms &quot;foo&quot;
and &quot;foo&quot; of program arguments are completely
interchangable. find breaks this paradigm;</p>

<p>find &quot;pattern&quot; file find pattern file</p>

<p>are not equivalent; find cannot be started directly
using the above API. One needs a way to surround the
doublequotes in some other quoting construction, necessarily
having an extra non-Unixish shell in between.</p>

<p>Use one of</p>

<p>system &rsquo;cmd&rsquo;, &rsquo;/c&rsquo;, &rsquo;find
&quot;pattern&quot; file&rsquo;; &lsquo;cmd /c &rsquo;find
&quot;pattern&quot; file&rsquo;&lsquo;</p>

<p>This would start find.exe via cmd.exe via
&quot;sh.exe&quot; via &quot;perl.exe&quot;, but this is a
price to pay if you want to use non-conforming program.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Automatic binary installation The most
convenient way of installing a binary distribution of perl
is via perl installer install.exe. Just follow the
instructions, and 99% of the installation blues would go
away.</p>

<p>Note however, that you need to have unzip.exe on your
path, and EMX environment running. The latter means that if
you just installed EMX, and made all the needed changes to
Config.sys, you may need to reboot in between. Check EMX
runtime by running</p>

<p>emxrev</p>

<p>Binary installer also creates a folder on your desktop
with some useful objects. If you need to change some aspects
of the work of the binary installer, feel free to edit the
file Perl.pkg. This may be useful e.g., if you need to run
the installer many times and do not want to make many
interactive changes in the GUI.</p>

<p>Things not taken care of by automatic binary
installation:</p>

<p>&quot;PERL_BADLANG&quot; may be needed if you change
your codepage after perl installation, and the new value is
not supported by EMX. See &quot;PERL_BADLANG&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; see
&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;.</p>

<p>Config.pm This file resides somewhere deep in the
location you installed your perl library, find it out by</p>

<p>perl -MConfig -le &quot;print
$INC{&rsquo;Config.pm&rsquo;}&quot;</p>

<p>While most important values in this file are updated by
the binary installer, some of them may need to be hand-
edited. I know no such data, please keep me informed if you
find one. Moreover, manual changes to the installed version
may need to be accompanied by an edit of this file.</p>

<p>NOTE. Because of a typo the binary installer of 5.00305
would install a variable &quot;PERL_SHPATH&quot; into
Config.sys. Please remove this variable and put
&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot; instead.</p>

<p>Manual binary installation As of version 5.00305, OS/2
perl binary distribution comes split into 11 components.
Unfortunately, to enable configurable binary installation,
the file paths in the zip files are not absolute, but
relative to some directory.</p>

<p>Note that the extraction with the stored paths is still
necessary (default with unzip, specify &quot;-d&quot; to
pkunzip). However, you need to know where to extract the
files. You need also to manually change entries in
Config.sys to reflect where did you put the files. Note that
if you have some primitive unzipper (like
&quot;pkunzip&quot;), you may get a lot of warnings/errors
during unzipping. Upgrade to &quot;(w)unzip&quot;.</p>

<p>Below is the sample of what to do to reproduce the
configuration on my machine. In VIEW.EXE you can press
&quot;Ctrl-Insert&quot; now, and cut-and- paste from the
resulting file - created in the directory you started
VIEW.EXE from.</p>

<p>For each component, we mention environment variables
related to each installation directory. Either choose
directories to match your values of the variables, or
create/append-to variables to take into account the
directories.</p>

<p>Perl VIO and PM executables (dynamically linked) unzip
perl_exc.zip *.exe *.ico -d f:/emx.add/bin unzip
perl_exc.zip *.dll -d f:/emx.add/dll</p>

<p>(have the directories with &quot;*.exe&quot; on PATH,
and &quot;*.dll&quot; on LIBPATH);</p>

<p>Perl_ VIO executable (statically linked) unzip
perl_aou.zip -d f:/emx.add/bin</p>

<p>(have the directory on PATH);</p>

<p>Executables for Perl utilities unzip perl_utl.zip -d
f:/emx.add/bin</p>

<p>(have the directory on PATH);</p>

<p>Main Perl library unzip perl_mlb.zip -d
f:/perllib/lib</p>

<p>If this directory is exactly the same as the prefix
which was compiled into perl.exe, you do not need to change
anything. However, for perl to find the library if you use a
different path, you need to &quot;set PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot;
in Config.sys, see &quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot;.</p>

<p>Additional Perl modules unzip perl_ste.zip -d
f:/perllib/lib/site_perl/5.10.1/</p>

<p>Same remark as above applies. Additionally, if this
directory is not one of directories on @INC (and @INC is
influenced by &quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot;), you need to put
this directory and subdirectory ./os2 in &quot;PERLLIB&quot;
or &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; variable. Do not use
&quot;PERL5LIB&quot; unless you have it set already. See
&quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot; in perl.</p>

<p>[Check whether this extraction directory is still
applicable with the new directory structure layout!]</p>

<p>Tools to compile Perl modules unzip perl_blb.zip -d
f:/perllib/lib</p>

<p>Same remark as for perl_ste.zip.</p>

<p>Manpages for Perl and utilities unzip perl_man.zip -d
f:/perllib/man</p>

<p>This directory should better be on &quot;MANPATH&quot;.
You need to have a working man to access these files.</p>

<p>Manpages for Perl modules unzip perl_mam.zip -d
f:/perllib/man</p>

<p>This directory should better be on &quot;MANPATH&quot;.
You need to have a working man to access these files.</p>

<p>Source for Perl documentation unzip perl_pod.zip -d
f:/perllib/lib</p>

<p>This is used by the &quot;perldoc&quot; program (see
perldoc), and may be used to generate HTML documentation
usable by WWW browsers, and documentation in zillions of
other formats: &quot;info&quot;, &quot;LaTeX&quot;,
&quot;Acrobat&quot;, &quot;FrameMaker&quot; and so on. [Use
programs such as pod2latex etc.]</p>

<p>Perl manual in .INF format unzip perl_inf.zip -d
d:/os2/book</p>

<p>This directory should better be on
&quot;BOOKSHELF&quot;.</p>

<p>Pdksh unzip perl_sh.zip -d f:/bin</p>

<p>This is used by perl to run external commands which
explicitly require shell, like the commands using
redirection and shell metacharacters. It is also used
instead of explicit /bin/sh.</p>

<p>Set &quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot; (see
&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;) if you move sh.exe from the above
location.</p>

<p>Note. It may be possible to use some other sh-compatible
shell (untested).</p>

<p>After you installed the components you needed and
updated the Config.sys correspondingly, you need to
hand-edit Config.pm. This file resides somewhere deep in the
location you installed your perl library, find it out by</p>

<p>perl -MConfig -le &quot;print
$INC{&rsquo;Config.pm&rsquo;}&quot;</p>

<p>You need to correct all the entries which look like file
paths (they currently start with &quot;f:/&quot;).</p>

<p>Warning The automatic and manual perl installation leave
precompiled paths inside perl executables. While these paths
are overwriteable (see &quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot;,
&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;), some people may prefer binary
editing of paths inside the executables/DLLs.</p>

<p>Accessing documentation Depending on how you
built/installed perl you may have (otherwise identical) Perl
documentation in the following formats:</p>

<p>OS/2 .INF file Most probably the most convenient form.
Under OS/2 view it as</p>

<p>view perl view perl perlfunc view perl less view perl
ExtUtils::MakeMaker</p>

<p>(currently the last two may hit a wrong location, but
this may improve soon). Under Win* see
&quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to build the docs yourself, and have OS/2
toolkit, run</p>

<p>pod2ipf &gt; perl.ipf</p>

<p>in /perllib/lib/pod directory, then</p>

<p>ipfc /inf perl.ipf</p>

<p>(Expect a lot of errors during the both steps.) Now move
it on your BOOKSHELF path.</p>

<p>Plain text If you have perl documentation in the source
form, perl utilities installed, and GNU groff installed, you
may use</p>

<p>perldoc perlfunc perldoc less perldoc
ExtUtils::MakeMaker</p>

<p>to access the perl documentation in the text form (note
that you may get better results using perl manpages).</p>

<p>Alternately, try running pod2text on .pod files.</p>

<p>Manpages If you have man installed on your system, and
you installed perl manpages, use something like this:</p>

<p>man perlfunc man 3 less man ExtUtils.MakeMaker</p>

<p>to access documentation for different components of
Perl. Start with</p>

<p>man perl</p>

<p>Note that dot (.) is used as a package separator for
documentation for packages, and as usual, sometimes you need
to give the section - 3 above - to avoid shadowing by the
less(1) manpage.</p>

<p>Make sure that the directory above the directory with
manpages is on our &quot;MANPATH&quot;, like this</p>

<p>set MANPATH=c:/man;f:/perllib/man</p>

<p>for Perl manpages in &quot;f:/perllib/man/man1/&quot;
etc.</p>

<p>HTML If you have some WWW browser available, installed
the Perl documentation in the source form, and Perl
utilities, you can build HTML docs. Cd to directory with
.pod files, and do like this</p>

<p>cd f:/perllib/lib/pod pod2html</p>

<p>After this you can direct your browser the file
perl.html in this directory, and go ahead with reading docs,
like this:</p>

<p>explore file:///f:/perllib/lib/pod/perl.html</p>

<p>Alternatively you may be able to get these docs prebuilt
from CPAN.</p>

<p>GNU &quot;info&quot; files Users of Emacs would
appreciate it very much, especially with &quot;CPerl&quot;
mode loaded. You need to get latest &quot;pod2texi&quot;
from &quot;CPAN&quot;, or, alternately, the prebuilt info
pages.</p>

<p>PDF files for &quot;Acrobat&quot; are available on CPAN
(may be for slightly older version of perl).</p>

<p>&quot;LaTeX&quot; docs can be constructed using

<p>BUILD Here we discuss how to build Perl under OS/2.
There is an alternative (but maybe older) view on
&lt;http://www.shadow.net/~troc/os2perl.html&gt;.</p>

<p>The short story Assume that you are a seasoned porter,
so are sure that all the necessary tools are already present
on your system, and you know how to get the Perl source
distribution. Untar it, change to the extract directory,
and</p>

<p>gnupatch -p0 &lt; os2iff.configure sh Configure -des -D
prefix=f:/perllib make make test make install make aout_test
make aout_install</p>

<p>This puts the executables in f:/perllib/bin. Manually
move them to the &quot;PATH&quot;, manually move the built
perl*.dll to &quot;LIBPATH&quot; (here for Perl DLL * is a
not-very-meaningful hex checksum), and run</p>

<p>make installcmd INSTALLCMDDIR=d:/ir/on/path</p>

<p>Assuming that the &quot;man&quot;-files were put on an
appropriate location, this completes the installation of
minimal Perl system. (The binary distribution contains also
a lot of additional modules, and the documentation in INF
format.)</p>

<p>What follows is a detailed guide through these
steps.</p>

<p>Prerequisites You need to have the latest EMX
development environment, the full GNU tool suite (gawk
renamed to awk, and GNU find.exe earlier on path than the
OS/2 find.exe, same with sort.exe, to check use</p>

<p>find --version sort --version</p>

<p>). You need the latest version of pdksh installed as
sh.exe.</p>

<p>Check that you have BSD libraries and headers installed,
and - optionally - Berkeley DB headers and libraries, and
crypt.</p>

<p>Possible locations to get the files:</p>

<p>ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/unix/
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/unix/
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/dev32/
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/emx09c/</p>

<p>It is reported that the following archives contain
enough utils to build perl: gnufutil.zip, gnusutil.zip,
gnututil.zip, gnused.zip, gnupatch.zip, gnuawk.zip,
gnumake.zip, gnugrep.zip, bsddev.zip and ksh527rt.zip (or a
later version). Note that all these utilities are known to
be available from LEO:</p>

<p>ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu</p>

<p>Note also that the db.lib and db.a from the EMX
distribution are not suitable for multi-threaded compile
(even single-threaded flavor of Perl uses multi-threaded C
RTL, for compatibility with XFree86-OS/2). Get a corrected
one from</p>

<p>http://www.ilyaz.org/software/os2/db_mt.zip</p>

<p>If you have exactly the same version of Perl installed
already, make sure that no copies or perl are currently
running. Later steps of the build may fail since an older
version of perl.dll loaded into memory may be found. Running
&quot;make test&quot; becomes meaningless, since the test
are checking a previous build of perl (this situation is
detected and reported by lib/os2_base.t test). Do not forget
to unset &quot;PERL_EMXLOAD_SEC&quot; in environment.</p>

<p>Also make sure that you have /tmp directory on the
current drive, and . directory in your &quot;LIBPATH&quot;.
One may try to correct the latter condition by</p>

<p>set BEGINLIBPATH ..</p>

<p>if you use something like CMD.EXE or latest versions of
4os2.exe. (Setting BEGINLIBPATH to just &quot;.&quot; is
ignored by the OS/2 kernel.)</p>

<p>Make sure your gcc is good for &quot;-Zomf&quot;
linking: run &quot;omflibs&quot; script in /emx/lib
directory.</p>

<p>Check that you have link386 installed. It comes standard
with OS/2, but may be not installed due to customization. If
typing</p>

<p>link386</p>

<p>shows you do not have it, do Selective install, and
choose &quot;Link object modules&quot; in Optional system
utilities/More. If you get into link386 prompts, press
&quot;Ctrl-C&quot; to exit.</p>

<p>Getting perl source You need to fetch the latest perl
source (including developers releases). With some
probability it is located in</p>

<p>http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0
http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/unsupported</p>

<p>If not, you may need to dig in the indices to find it in
the directory of the current maintainer.</p>

<p>Quick cycle of developers release may break the OS/2
build time to time, looking into</p>

<p>http://www.cpan.org/ports/os2/</p>

<p>may indicate the latest release which was publicly
released by the maintainer. Note that the release may
include some additional patches to apply to the current
source of perl.</p>

<p>Extract it like this</p>

<p>tar vzxf perl5.00409.tar.gz</p>

<p>You may see a message about errors while extracting
Configure. This is because there is a conflict with a
similarly-named file configure.</p>

<p>Change to the directory of extraction.</p>

<p>Application of the patches You need to apply the patches
in ./os2/diff.* like this:</p>

<p>gnupatch -p0 &lt; os2iff.configure</p>

<p>You may also need to apply the patches supplied with the
binary distribution of perl. It also makes sense to look on
the perl5-porters mailing list for the latest OS/2-related
patches (see
&lt;http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/&gt;).
Such patches usually contain strings &quot;/os2/&quot; and
&quot;patch&quot;, so it makes sense looking for these
strings.</p>

<p>Hand-editing You may look into the file ./hints/os2.sh
and correct anything wrong you find there. I do not expect
it is needed anywhere.</p>

<p>Making sh Configure -des -D prefix=f:/perllib</p>

<p>&quot;prefix&quot; means: where to install the resulting
perl library. Giving correct prefix you may avoid the need
to specify &quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot;, see
&quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot;.</p>

<p>Ignore the message about missing &quot;ln&quot;, and
about &quot;-c&quot; option to tr. The latter is most
probably already fixed, if you see it and can trace where
the latter spurious warning comes from, please inform
me.</p>

<p>Now</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>At some moment the built may die, reporting a version
mismatch or unable to run perl. This means that you do not
have . in your LIBPATH, so perl.exe cannot find the needed
perl67B2.dll (treat these hex digits as line noise). After
this is fixed the build should finish without a lot of
fuss.</p>

<p>Testing Now run</p>

<p>make test</p>

<p>All tests should succeed (with some of them skipped). If
you have the same version of Perl installed, it is crucial
that you have &quot;.&quot; early in your LIBPATH (or in
BEGINLIBPATH), otherwise your tests will most probably test
the wrong version of Perl.</p>

<p>Some tests may generate extra messages similar to</p>

<p>A lot of &quot;bad free&quot; in database tests related
to Berkeley DB. This should be fixed already. If it
persists, you may disable this warnings, see
&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;.</p>

<p>Process terminated by SIGTERM/SIGINT This is a standard
message issued by OS/2 applications. *nix applications die
in silence. It is considered to be a feature. One can easily
disable this by appropriate sighandlers.</p>

<p>However the test engine bleeds these message to screen
in unexpected moments. Two messages of this kind should be
present during testing.</p>

<p>To get finer test reports, call</p>

<p>perl t/harness</p>

<p>The report with io/pipe.t failing may look like
this:</p>

<p>Failed Test Status Wstat Total Fail Failed List of
failed
------------------------------------------------------------
io/pipe.t 12 1 8.33% 9 7 tests skipped, plus 56 subtests
skipped. Failed 1/195 test scripts, 99.49% okay. 1/6542
subtests failed, 99.98% okay.</p>

<p>The reasons for most important skipped tests are:</p>

<p>op/fs.t 18 Checks &quot;atime&quot; and
&quot;mtime&quot; of &quot;stat()&quot; - unfortunately,
HPFS provides only 2sec time granularity (for compatibility
with FAT?).</p>

<p>25 Checks &quot;truncate()&quot; on a filehandle just
opened for write - I do not know why this should or should
not work.</p>

<p>op/stat.t Checks &quot;stat()&quot;. Tests:</p>

<p>4 Checks &quot;atime&quot; and &quot;mtime&quot; of
&quot;stat()&quot; - unfortunately, HPFS provides only 2sec
time granularity (for compatibility with FAT?).</p>

<p>Installing the built perl If you havent yet moved
&quot;perl*.dll&quot; onto LIBPATH, do it now.</p>

<p>Run</p>

<p>make install</p>

<p>It would put the generated files into needed locations.
Manually put perl.exe, perl__.exe and perl___.exe to a
location on your PATH, perl.dll to a location on your
LIBPATH.</p>

<p>Run</p>

<p>make installcmd INSTALLCMDDIR=d:/ir/on/path</p>

<p>to convert perl utilities to .cmd files and put them on
PATH. You need to put .EXE-utilities on path manually. They
are installed in &quot;$prefix/bin&quot;, here $prefix is
what you gave to Configure, see Making.</p>

<p>If you use &quot;man&quot;, either move the installed
*/man/ directories to your &quot;MANPATH&quot;, or modify
&quot;MANPATH&quot; to match the location. (One could have
avoided this by providing a correct &quot;manpath&quot;
option to ./Configure, or editing ./config.sh between
configuring and making steps.)</p>

<p>&quot;a.out&quot;-style build Proceed as above, but make
perl_.exe (see &quot;perl_.exe&quot;) by</p>

<p>make perl_</p>

<p>test and install by</p>

<p>make aout_test make aout_install</p>

<p>Manually put perl_.exe to a location on your PATH.</p>

<p>Note. The build process for &quot;perl_&quot; does not
know about all the dependencies, so you should make sure
that anything is up-to-date, say, by doing</p>

<p>make perl_dll</p>

<p>first.</p>

<p>Building a binary distribution [This section provides a
short overview only...]</p>

<p>Building should proceed differently depending on whether
the version of perl you install is already present and used
on your system, or is a new version not yet used. The
description below assumes that the version is new, so
installing its DLLs and .pm files will not disrupt the
operation of your system even if some intermediate steps are
not yet fully working.</p>

<p>The other cases require a little bit more convoluted
procedures. Below I suppose that the current version of Perl
is 5.8.2, so the executables are named accordingly.</p>

<p>1. Fully build and test the Perl distribution. Make sure
that no tests are failing with &quot;test&quot; and
&quot;aout_test&quot; targets; fix the bugs in Perl and the
Perl test suite detected by these tests. Make sure that
&quot;all_test&quot; make target runs as clean as possible.
Check that &quot;os2/perlrexx.cmd&quot; runs fine.</p>

<p>2. Fully install Perl, including &quot;installcmd&quot;
target. Copy the generated DLLs to &quot;LIBPATH&quot;; copy
the numbered Perl executables (as in perl5.8.2.exe) to
&quot;PATH&quot;; copy &quot;perl_.exe&quot; to
&quot;PATH&quot; as &quot;perl_5.8.2.exe&quot;. Think
whether you need backward-compatibility DLLs. In most cases
you do not need to install them yet; but sometime this may
simplify the following steps.</p>

<p>3. Make sure that &quot;CPAN.pm&quot; can download files
from CPAN. If not, you may need to manually install
&quot;Net::FTP&quot;.</p>

<p>4. Install the bundle
&quot;Bundle::OS2_default&quot;</p>

<p>perl5.8.2 -MCPAN -e &quot;install
Bundle::OS2_default&quot; &lt; nul |&amp; tee 00cpan_i_1</p>

<p>This may take a couple of hours on 1GHz processor (when
run the first time). And this should not be necessarily a
smooth procedure. Some modules may not specify required
dependencies, so one may need to repeat this procedure
several times until the results stabilize.</p>

<p>perl5.8.2 -MCPAN -e &quot;install
Bundle::OS2_default&quot; &lt; nul |&amp; tee 00cpan_i_2
perl5.8.2 -MCPAN -e &quot;install Bundle::OS2_default&quot;
&lt; nul |&amp; tee 00cpan_i_3</p>

<p>Even after they stabilize, some tests may fail.</p>

<p>Fix as many discovered bugs as possible. Document all
the bugs which are not fixed, and all the failures with
unknown reasons. Inspect the produced logs 00cpan_i_1 to
find suspiciously skipped tests, and other fishy events.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that installation of some modules may fail
too: for example, the DLLs to update may be already loaded
by CPAN.pm. Inspect the &quot;install&quot; logs (in the
example above 00cpan_i_1 etc) for errors, and install things
manually, as in</p>

<p>cd $CPANHOME/.cpan/build/Digest-MD5-2.31 make
install</p>

<p>Some distributions may fail some tests, but you may want
to install them anyway (as above, or via &quot;force
install&quot; command of &quot;CPAN.pm&quot;
shell-mode).</p>

<p>Since this procedure may take quite a long time to
complete, it makes sense to &quot;freeze&quot; your CPAN
configuration by disabling periodic updates of the local
copy of CPAN index: set &quot;index_expire&quot; to some big
value (I use 365), then save the settings</p>

<p>CPAN&gt; o conf index_expire 365 CPAN&gt; o conf
commit</p>

<p>Reset back to the default value 1 when you are
finished.</p>

<p>5. When satisfied with the results, rerun the
&quot;installcmd&quot; target. Now you can copy
&quot;perl5.8.2.exe&quot; to &quot;perl.exe&quot;, and
install the other OMF-build executables:
&quot;perl__.exe&quot; etc. They are ready to be used.</p>

<p>6. Change to the &quot;./pod&quot; directory of the
build tree, download the Perl logo CamelGrayBig.BMP, and
run</p>

<p>( perl2ipf &gt; perl.ipf ) |&amp; tee 00ipf ipfc /INF
perl.ipf |&amp; tee 00inf</p>

<p>This produces the Perl docs online book
&quot;perl.INF&quot;. Install in on &quot;BOOKSHELF&quot;
path.</p>

<p>7. Now is the time to build statically linked executable
perl_.exe which includes newly-installed via
&quot;Bundle::OS2_default&quot; modules. Doing testing via
&quot;CPAN.pm&quot; is going to be painfully slow, since it
statically links a new executable per XS extension.</p>

<p>Here is a possible workaround: create a toplevel
Makefile.PL in $CPANHOME/.cpan/build/ with contents being
(compare with &quot;Making executables with a custom
collection of statically loaded extensions&quot;)</p>

<p>use ExtUtils::MakeMaker; WriteMakefile NAME =&gt;
&rsquo;dummy&rsquo;;</p>

<p>execute this as</p>

<p>perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL &lt;nul |&amp; tee 00aout_c1
make -k all test &lt;nul |&amp; 00aout_t1</p>

<p>Again, this procedure should not be absolutely smooth.
Some &quot;Makefile.PL&quot;s in subdirectories may be
buggy, and would not run as &quot;child&quot; scripts. The
interdependency of modules can strike you; however, since
non-XS modules are already installed, the prerequisites of
most modules have a very good chance to be present.</p>

<p>If you discover some glitches, move directories of
problematic modules to a different location; if these
modules are non-XS modules, you may just ignore them - they
are already installed; the remaining, XS, modules you need
to install manually one by one.</p>

<p>After each such removal you need to rerun the
&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;/&quot;make&quot; process; usually
this procedure converges soon. (But be sure to convert all
the necessary external C libraries from .lib format to .a
format: run one of</p>

<p>emxaout foo.lib emximp -o foo.a foo.lib</p>

<p>whichever is appropriate.) Also, make sure that the DLLs
for external libraries are usable with with executables
compiled without &quot;-Zmtd&quot; options.</p>

<p>When you are sure that only a few subdirectories lead to
failures, you may want to add &quot;-j4&quot; option to
&quot;make&quot; to speed up skipping subdirectories with
already finished build.</p>

<p>When you are satisfied with the results of tests,
install the build C libraries for extensions:</p>

<p>make install |&amp; tee 00aout_i</p>

<p>Now you can rename the file ./perl.exe generated during
the last phase to perl_5.8.2.exe; place it on
&quot;PATH&quot;; if there is an inter- dependency between
some XS modules, you may need to repeat the
&quot;test&quot;/&quot;install&quot; loop with this new
executable and some excluded modules - until the procedure
converges.</p>

<p>Now you have all the necessary .a libraries for these
Perl modules in the places where Perl builder can find it.
Use the perl builder: change to an empty directory, create a
&quot;dummy&quot; Makefile.PL again, and run</p>

<p>perl_5.8.2.exe Makefile.PL |&amp; tee 00c make perl
|&amp; tee 00p</p>

<p>This should create an executable ./perl.exe with all the
statically loaded extensions built in. Compare the generated
perlmain.c files to make sure that during the iterations the
number of loaded extensions only increases. Rename
./perl.exe to perl_5.8.2.exe on &quot;PATH&quot;.</p>

<p>When it converges, you got a functional variant of
perl_5.8.2.exe; copy it to &quot;perl_.exe&quot;. You are
done with generation of the local Perl installation.</p>

<p>8. Make sure that the installed modules are actually
installed in the location of the new Perl, and are not
inherited from entries of @INC given for inheritance from
the older versions of Perl: set
&quot;PERLLIB_582_PREFIX&quot; to redirect the new version
of Perl to a new location, and copy the installed files to
this new location. Redo the tests to make sure that the
versions of modules inherited from older versions of Perl
are not needed.</p>

<p>Actually, the log output of pod2ipf during the step 6
gives a very detailed info about which modules are loaded
from which place; so you may use it as an additional
verification tool.</p>

<p>Check that some temporary files did not make into the
perl install tree. Run something like this</p>

<p>pfind . -f
&quot;!(/.(pm|pl|ix|al|h|a|lib|txt|pod|imp|bs|dll|ld|bs|inc|xbm|yml|cgi|uu|e2x|skip|packlist|eg|cfg|html|pub|enc|all|ini|po|pot)$/i
or /^264</p>

<p>in the install tree (both top one and sitelib one).</p>

<p>Compress all the DLLs with lxlite. The tiny .exe can be
compressed with &quot;/c:max&quot; (the bug only appears
when there is a fixup in the last 6 bytes of a page (?);
since the tiny executables are much smaller than a page, the
bug will not hit). Do not compress &quot;perl_.exe&quot; -
it would not work under DOS.</p>

<p>9. Now you can generate the binary distribution. This is
done by running the test of the CPAN distribution
&quot;OS2::SoftInstaller&quot;. Tune up the file test.pl to
suit the layout of current version of Perl first. Do not
forget to pack the necessary external DLLs accordingly.
Include the description of the bugs and test suite failures
you could not fix. Include the small-stack versions of Perl
executables from Perl build directory.</p>

<p>Include perl5.def so that people can relink the perl DLL
preserving the binary compatibility, or can create
compatibility DLLs. Include the diff files (&quot;diff -pu
old new&quot;) of fixes you did so that people can rebuild
your version. Include perl5.map so that one can use remote
debugging.</p>

<p>10. Share what you did with the other people. Relax.
Enjoy fruits of your work.</p>

<p>11. Brace yourself for thanks, bug reports, hate mail
and spam coming as result of the previous step. No good deed
should remain unpunished!</p>

<p>Building custom .EXE files The Perl executables can be
easily rebuilt at any moment. Moreover, one can use the
embedding interface (see perlembed) to make very customized
executables.</p>

<p>Making executables with a custom collection of
statically loaded extensions It is a little bit easier to do
so while decreasing the list of statically loaded
extensions. We discuss this case only here.</p>

<p>1. Change to an empty directory, and create a
placeholder &lt;Makefile.PL&gt;:</p>

<p>use ExtUtils::MakeMaker; WriteMakefile NAME =&gt;
&rsquo;dummy&rsquo;;</p>

<p>2. Run it with the flavor of Perl (perl.exe or
perl_.exe) you want to rebuild.</p>

<p>perl_ Makefile.PL</p>

<p>3. Ask it to create new Perl executable:</p>

<p>make perl</p>

<p>(you may need to manually add
&quot;PERLTYPE=-DPERL_CORE&quot; to this commandline on some
versions of Perl; the symptom is that the command-line
globbing does not work from OS/2 shells with the
newly-compiled executable; check with</p>

<p>.erl.exe -wle &quot;print for @ARGV&quot; *</p>

<p>).</p>

<p>4. The previous step created perlmain.c which contains a
list of newXS() calls near the end. Removing unnecessary
calls, and rerunning</p>

<p>make perl</p>

<p>will produce a customized executable.</p>

<p>Making executables with a custom search-paths The
default perl executable is flexible enough to support most
usages. However, one may want something yet more flexible;
for example, one may want to find Perl DLL relatively to the
location of the EXE file; or one may want to ignore the
environment when setting the Perl-library search patch,
etc.</p>

<p>If you fill comfortable with embedding interface (see
perlembed), such things are easy to do repeating the steps
outlined in &quot;Making executables with a custom
collection of statically loaded extensions&quot;, and doing
more comprehensive edits to main() of perlmain.c. The people
with little desire to understand Perl can just rename
main(), and do necessary modification in a custom main()
which calls the renamed function in appropriate time.</p>

<p>However, there is a third way: perl DLL exports the
main() function and several callbacks to customize the
search path. Below is a complete example of a &quot;Perl
loader&quot; which</p>

<p>1. Looks for Perl DLL in the directory
&quot;$exedir/../dll&quot;;</p>

<p>2. Prepends the above directory to
&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;;</p>

<p>3. Fails if the Perl DLL found via
&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot; is different from what was loaded
on step 1; e.g., another process could have loaded it from
&quot;LIBPATH&quot; or from a different value of
&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;. In these cases one needs to modify
the setting of the system so that this other process either
does not run, or loads the DLL from &quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot;
with &quot;LIBPATHSTRICT=T&quot; (available with kernels
after September 2000).</p>

<p>4. Loads Perl library from
&quot;$exedir/../dll/lib/&quot;.</p>

<p>5. Uses Bourne shell from
&quot;$exedir/../dll/sh/ksh.exe&quot;.</p>

<p>For best results compile the C file below with the same
options as the Perl DLL. However, a lot of functionality
will work even if the executable is not an EMX applications,
e.g., if compiled with</p>

<p>gcc -Wall -DDOSISH -DOS2=1 -O2 -s -Zomf -Zsys
perl-starter.c -DPERL_DLL_BASENAME=</p>

<p>Here is the sample C file:</p>

<p>#define INCL_DOS #define INCL_NOPM /* These are needed

#define INCL_DOSPROCESS #include &lt;os2.h&gt;</p>

<p>op/sprintf test failure This can result from a bug in

<p>Specific (mis)features of OS/2 port
&quot;setpriority&quot;, &quot;getpriority&quot; Note that
these functions are compatible with *nix, not with the older
ports of 94 - 95. The priorities are absolute, go from 32 to
-95, lower is quicker. 0 is the default priority.</p>

<p>WARNING. Calling &quot;getpriority&quot; on a
non-existing process could lock the system before Warp3
fixpak22. Starting with Warp3, Perl will use a workaround:
it aborts getpriority() if the process is not present. This
is not possible on older versions &quot;2.*&quot;, and has a
race condition anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;system()&quot; Multi-argument form of
&quot;system()&quot; allows an additional numeric argument.
The meaning of this argument is described in
OS2::Process.</p>

<p>When finding a program to run, Perl first asks the OS to
look for executables on &quot;PATH&quot; (OS/2 adds
extension .exe if no extension is present). If not found, it
looks for a script with possible extensions added in this
order: no extension, .cmd, .btm, .bat, .pl. If found, Perl
checks the start of the file for magic strings
&quot;#!&quot; and &quot;extproc &quot;. If found, Perl uses
the rest of the first line as the beginning of the command
line to run this script. The only mangling done to the first
line is extraction of arguments (currently up to 3), and
ignoring of the path-part of the &quot;interpreter&quot;
name if it can t be found using the full path.</p>

<p>E.g., &quot;system &rsquo;foo&rsquo;, &rsquo;bar&rsquo;,
&rsquo;baz&rsquo;&quot; may lead Perl to finding
C:/emx/bin/foo.cmd with the first line being</p>

<p>extproc /bin/bash -x -c</p>

<p>If /bin/bash.exe is not found, then Perl looks for an
executable bash.exe on &quot;PATH&quot;. If found in
C:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe, then the above system() is
translated to</p>

<p>system qw(C:/emx.add/bin/bash.exe -x -c
C:/emx/bin/foo.cmd bar baz)</p>

<p>One additional translation is performed: instead of
/bin/sh Perl uses the hardwired-or-customized shell (see
&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;).</p>

<p>The above search for &quot;interpreter&quot; is
recursive: if bash executable is not found, but bash.btm is
found, Perl will investigate its first line etc. The only
hardwired limit on the recursion depth is implicit: there is
a limit 4 on the number of additional arguments inserted
before the actual arguments given to system(). In
particular, if no additional arguments are specified on the
&quot;magic&quot; first lines, then the limit on the depth
is 4.</p>

<p>If Perl finds that the found executable is of PM type
when the current session is not, it will start the new
process in a separate session of necessary type. Call via
&quot;OS2::Process&quot; to disable this magic.</p>

<p>WARNING. Due to the described logic, you need to
explicitly specify .com extension if needed. Moreover, if
the executable perl5.6.1 is requested, Perl will not look
for perl5.6.1.exe. [This may change in the future.]</p>

<p>&quot;extproc&quot; on the first line If the first chars
of a Perl script are &quot;extproc &quot;, this line is
treated as &quot;#!&quot;-line, thus all the switches on
this line are processed (twice if script was started via
cmd.exe). See &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; in perlrun.</p>

<p>Additional modules: OS2::Process, OS2::DLL, OS2::REXX,
OS2::PrfDB, OS2::ExtAttr. These modules provide access to
additional numeric argument for &quot;system&quot; and to
the information about the running process, to DLLs having
functions with REXX signature and to the REXX runtime, to
OS/2 databases in the .INI format, and to Extended
Attributes.</p>

<p>Two additional extensions by Andreas Kaiser,
&quot;OS2::UPM&quot;, and &quot;OS2::FTP&quot;, are included
into &quot;ILYAZ&quot; directory, mirrored on CPAN. Other
OS/2-related extensions are available too.</p>

<p>&quot;Cwd::sys_is_absolute(name)&quot; means has drive
letter and is_rooted.</p>

<p>&quot;Cwd::sys_is_rooted(name)&quot; means has leading

&quot;dir&quot;. &quot;Dir&quot; defaults to the current
dir.</p>

<p>&quot;Cwd::extLibpath([type])&quot; Get current value of
extended library search path. If &quot;type&quot; is present
and positive, works with &quot;END_LIBPATH&quot;, if

otherwise bit 1 is set if on the previous call do_harderror
was enabled, bit 2 is set if on previous call do_exception
was enabled.</p>

<p>This function enables/disables error popups associated

exceptions.</p>

<p>I know of no way to find out the state of popups before
the first call to this function.</p>

<p>&quot;OS2::Errors2Drive(drive)&quot; Returns
&quot;undef&quot; if it was not called yet, otherwise return
false if errors were not requested to be written to a hard
drive, or the drive letter if this was requested.</p>

<p>This function may redirect error popups associated with
hardware errors (Disk not ready etc.) and software
exceptions to the file POPUPLOG.OS2 at the root directory of
the specified drive. Overrides OS2::Error() specified by
individual programs. Given argument undef will disable
redirection.</p>

<p>Has global effect, persists after the application
exits.</p>

<p>&quot;OS2::MorphPM(serve)&quot;,
&quot;OS2::UnMorphPM(serve)&quot; Transforms the current
application into a PM application and back. The argument
true means that a real message loop is going to be served.
OS2::MorphPM() returns the PM message queue handle as an
integer.</p>

<p>See &quot;Centralized management of resources&quot; for
additional details.</p>

<p>&quot;OS2::Serve_Messages(force)&quot; Fake on-demand
retrieval of outstanding PM messages. If &quot;force&quot;
is false, will not dispatch messages if a real message loop
is known to be present. Returns number of messages
retrieved.</p>

<p>Dies with &quot;QUITing...&quot; if WM_QUIT message is
obtained.</p>

<p>&quot;OS2::Process_Messages(force [, cnt])&quot;
Retrieval of PM messages until window creation/destruction.
If &quot;force&quot; is false, will not dispatch messages if
a real message loop is known to be present.</p>

<p>Returns change in number of windows. If &quot;cnt&quot;
is given, it is incremented by the number of messages
retrieved.</p>

<p>Dies with &quot;QUITing...&quot; if WM_QUIT message is
obtained.</p>

<p>&quot;OS2::_control87(new,mask)&quot; the same as
_control87(3) of EMX. Takes integers as arguments, returns
the previous coprocessor control word as an integer. Only
bits in &quot;new&quot; which are present in
&quot;mask&quot; are changed in the control word.</p>

<p>OS2::get_control87() gets the coprocessor control word
as an integer.</p>


<p>&quot;OS2::set_control87_em(new=MCW_EM,mask=MCW_EM)&quot;
The variant of OS2::_control87() with default values good
for handling exception mask: if no &quot;mask&quot;, uses
exception mask part of &quot;new&quot; only. If no
&quot;new&quot;, disables all the floating point
exceptions.</p>

<p>See &quot;Misfeatures&quot; for details.</p>

<p>&quot;OS2::DLLname([how [, xsub]])&quot; Gives the
information about the Perl DLL or the DLL containing the C
function bound to by &amp;xsub. The meaning of
&quot;how&quot; is: default (2): full name; 0: handle; 1:
module name.</p>

<p>(Note that some of these may be moved to different
libraries - eventually).</p>

<p>Prebuilt variables: $OS2::emx_rev numeric value is the
same as _emx_rev of EMX, a string value the same as
_emx_vprt (similar to &quot;0.9c&quot;).</p>

<p>$OS2::emx_env same as _emx_env of EMX, a number similar
to 0x8001.</p>

<p>$OS2::os_ver a number &quot;OS_MAJOR + 0.001 *
OS_MINOR&quot;.</p>

<p>$OS2::is_aout true if the Perl library was compiled in
AOUT format.</p>

<p>$OS2::can_fork true if the current executable is an AOUT
EMX executable, so Perl can fork. Do not use this, use the
portable check for $Config::Config{dfork}.</p>

<p>$OS2::nsyserror This variable (default is 1) controls
whether to enforce the contents of $^E to start with
&quot;SYS0003&quot;-like id. If set to 0, then the string
value of $^E is what is available from the OS/2 message
file. (Some messages in this file have an
&quot;SYS0003&quot;-like id prepended, some not.)</p>

<p>Misfeatures &middot; Since flock(3) is present in EMX,
but is not functional, it is emulated by perl. To disable
the emulations, set environment variable
&quot;USE_PERL_FLOCK=0&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Here is the list of things which may be
&quot;broken&quot; on EMX (from EMX docs):</p>

<p>&middot; The functions recvmsg(3), sendmsg(3), and
socketpair(3) are not implemented.</p>

<p>&middot; sock_init(3) is not required and not
implemented.</p>

<p>&middot; flock(3) is not yet implemented (dummy
function). (Perl has a workaround.)</p>

<p>&middot; kill(3): Special treatment of PID=0, PID=1 and
PID=-1 is not implemented.</p>

<p>&middot; waitpid(3):</p>

<p>WUNTRACED Not implemented. waitpid() is not implemented
for negative values of PID.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;kill -9&quot; does not work with the
current version of EMX.</p>

<p>&middot; See &quot;Text-mode filehandles&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Unix-domain sockets on OS/2 live in a
pseudo-file-system &quot;/sockets/...&quot;. To avoid a
failure to create a socket with a name of a different form,
&quot;/socket/&quot; is prepended to the socket name (unless
it starts with this already).</p>

<p>This may lead to problems later in case the socket is
accessed via the &quot;usual&quot; file-system calls using
the &quot;initial&quot; name.</p>

<p>&middot; Apparently, IBM used a compiler (for some
period of time around 95?) which changes FP mask right and
left. This is not that bad for IBMs programs, but the same
compiler was used for DLLs which are used with
general-purpose applications. When these DLLs are used, the
state of floating-point flags in the application is not
predictable.</p>

<p>What is much worse, some DLLs change the floating point
flags when in _DLLInitTerm() (e.g., TCP32IP). This means
that even if you do not call any function in the DLL, just
the act of loading this DLL will reset your flags. What is
worse, the same compiler was used to compile some HOOK DLLs.
Given that HOOK dlls are executed in the context of all the
applications in the system, this means a complete
unpredictablity of floating point flags on systems using
such HOOK DLLs. E.g., GAMESRVR.DLL of DIVE origin changes
the floating point flags on each write to the TTY of a VIO
(windowed text-mode) applications.</p>

<p>Some other (not completely debugged) situations when FP
flags change include some video drivers (?), and some
operations related to creation of the windows. People who
code OpenGL may have more experience on this.</p>

<p>Perl is generally used in the situation when all the
floating-point exceptions are ignored, as is the default
under EMX. If they are not ignored, some benign Perl
programs would get a &quot;SIGFPE&quot; and would die a
horrible death.</p>

<p>To circumvent this, Perl uses two hacks. They help
against one type of damage only: FP flags changed when
loading a DLL.</p>

<p>One of the hacks is to disable floating point exceptions
on Perl startup (as is the default with EMX). This helps
only with compile-time-linked DLLs changing the flags before
main() had a chance to be called.</p>

<p>The other hack is to restore FP flags after a call to
dlopen(). This helps against similar damage done by DLLs
_DLLInitTerm() at runtime. Currently no way to switch these
hacks off is provided.</p>

<p>Modifications Perl modifies some standard C library
calls in the following ways:</p>

<p>&quot;popen&quot; &quot;my_popen&quot; uses sh.exe if
shell is required, cf. &quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;tmpnam&quot; is created using &quot;TMP&quot; or
&quot;TEMP&quot; environment variable, via
&quot;tempnam&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;tmpfile&quot; If the current directory is not
writable, file is created using modified &quot;tmpnam&quot;,
so there may be a race condition.</p>

<p>&quot;ctermid&quot; a dummy implementation.</p>

<p>&quot;stat&quot; &quot;os2_stat&quot; special-cases
/dev/tty and /dev/con.</p>

<p>&quot;mkdir&quot;, &quot;rmdir&quot; these EMX functions
do not work if the path contains a trailing &quot;/&quot;.
Perl contains a workaround for this.</p>

<p>&quot;flock&quot; Since flock(3) is present in EMX, but
is not functional, it is emulated by perl. To disable the
emulations, set environment variable
&quot;USE_PERL_FLOCK=0&quot;.</p>

<p>Identifying DLLs All the DLLs built with the current
versions of Perl have ID strings identifying the name of the
extension, its version, and the version of Perl required for
this DLL. Run &quot;bldlevel DLL-name&quot; to find this
info.</p>

<p>Centralized management of resources Since to call
certain OS/2 API one needs to have a correctly initialized
&quot;Win&quot; subsystem, OS/2-specific extensions may
require getting &quot;HAB&quot;s and &quot;HMQ&quot;s. If an
extension would do it on its own, another extension could
fail to initialize.</p>

<p>Perl provides a centralized management of these
resources:</p>

<p>&quot;HAB&quot; To get the HAB, the extension should
call &quot;hab = perl_hab_GET()&quot; in C. After this call
is performed, &quot;hab&quot; may be accessed as
&quot;Perl_hab&quot;. There is no need to release the HAB
after it is used.</p>

<p>If by some reasons perl.h cannot be included, use</p>

<p>extern int Perl_hab_GET(void);</p>

<p>instead.</p>

<p>&quot;HMQ&quot; There are two cases:</p>

<p>&middot; the extension needs an &quot;HMQ&quot; only
because some API will not work otherwise. Use &quot;serve =
0&quot; below.</p>

<p>&middot; the extension needs an &quot;HMQ&quot; since it
wants to engage in a PM event loop. Use &quot;serve =
1&quot; below.</p>

<p>To get an &quot;HMQ&quot;, the extension should call
&quot;hmq = perl_hmq_GET(serve)&quot; in C. After this call
is performed, &quot;hmq&quot; may be accessed as
&quot;Perl_hmq&quot;.</p>

<p>To signal to Perl that HMQ is not needed any more, call
&quot;perl_hmq_UNSET(serve)&quot;. Perl process will
automatically morph/unmorph itself into/from a PM process if
HMQ is needed/not-needed. Perl will automatically
enable/disable &quot;WM_QUIT&quot; message during shutdown
if the message queue is served/not-served.</p>

<p>NOTE. If during a shutdown there is a message queue
which did not disable WM_QUIT, and which did not process the
received WM_QUIT message, the shutdown will be automatically
cancelled. Do not call perl_hmq_GET(1) unless you are going
to process messages on an orderly basis.</p>

<p>* Treating errors reported by OS/2 API There are two
principal conventions (it is useful to call them
&quot;Dos*&quot; and &quot;Win*&quot; - though this part of
the function signature is not always determined by the name
of the API) of reporting the error conditions of OS/2 API.
Most of &quot;Dos*&quot; APIs report the error code as the
result of the call (so 0 means success, and there are many
types of errors). Most of &quot;Win*&quot; API report
success/fail via the result being
&quot;TRUE&quot;/&quot;FALSE&quot;; to find the reason for
the failure one should call WinGetLastError() API.</p>

<p>Some &quot;Win*&quot; entry points also overload a
&quot;meaningful&quot; return value with the error
indicator; having a 0 return value indicates an error. Yet
some other &quot;Win*&quot; entry points overload things
even more, and 0 return value may mean a successful call
returning a valid value 0, as well as an error condition; in
the case of a 0 return value one should call
WinGetLastError() API to distinguish a successful call from
a failing one.</p>

<p>By convention, all the calls to OS/2 API should indicate
their failures by resetting $^E. All the Perl-accessible
functions which call OS/2 API may be broken into two
classes: some die()s when an API error is encountered, the
other report the error via a false return value (of course,
this does not concern Perl-accessible functions which expect
a failure of the OS/2 API call, having some workarounds
coded).</p>

<p>Obviously, in the situation of the last type of the
signature of an OS/2 API, it is must more convenient for the
users if the failure is indicated by die()ing: one does not
need to check $^E to know that something went wrong. If,
however, this solution is not desirable by some reason, the
code in question should reset $^E to 0 before making this
OS/2 API call, so that the caller of this Perl-accessible
function has a chance to distinguish a success-but-0-return
value from a failure. (One may return undef as an
alternative way of reporting an error.)</p>

<p>The macros to simplify this type of error propagation
are</p>

<p>&quot;CheckOSError(expr)&quot; Returns true on error,
sets $^E. Expects expr() be a call of &quot;Dos*&quot;-style
API.</p>

<p>&quot;CheckWinError(expr)&quot; Returns true on error,
sets $^E. Expects expr() be a call of &quot;Win*&quot;-style
API.</p>

<p>&quot;SaveWinError(expr)&quot; Returns &quot;expr&quot;,
sets $^E from WinGetLastError() if &quot;expr&quot; is
false.</p>

<p>&quot;SaveCroakWinError(expr,die,name1,name2)&quot;
Returns &quot;expr&quot;, sets $^E from WinGetLastError() if
&quot;expr&quot; is false, and die()s if &quot;die&quot; and
$^E are true. The message to die is the concatenated strings
&quot;name1&quot; and &quot;name2&quot;, separated by
&quot;: &quot; from the contents of $^E.</p>

<p>&quot;WinError_2_Perl_rc&quot; Sets &quot;Perl_rc&quot;
to the return value of WinGetLastError().</p>

<p>&quot;FillWinError&quot; Sets &quot;Perl_rc&quot; to the
return value of WinGetLastError(), and sets $^E to the
corresponding value.</p>

<p>&quot;FillOSError(rc)&quot; Sets &quot;Perl_rc&quot; to
&quot;rc&quot;, and sets $^E to the corresponding value.</p>

<p>* Loading DLLs and ordinals in DLLs Some DLLs are only
present in some versions of OS/2, or in some configurations
of OS/2. Some exported entry points are present only in DLLs
shipped with some versions of OS/2. If these DLLs and entry
points were linked directly for a Perl executable/DLL or
from a Perl extensions, this binary would work only with the
specified versions/setups. Even if these entry points were
not needed, the load of the executable (or DLL) would
fail.</p>

<p>For example, many newer useful APIs are not present in
OS/2 v2; many PM-related APIs require DLLs not available on
floppy-boot setup.</p>

<p>To make these calls fail only when the calls are
executed, one should call these API via a dynamic linking
API. There is a subsystem in Perl to simplify such type of
calls. A large number of entry points available for such
linking is provided (see &quot;entries_ordinals&quot; - and
also &quot;PMWIN_entries&quot; - in os2ish.h). These
ordinals can be accessed via the APIs:</p>

<p>CallORD(), DeclFuncByORD(), DeclVoidFuncByORD(),
DeclOSFuncByORD(), DeclWinFuncByORD(), AssignFuncPByORD(),
DeclWinFuncByORD_CACHE(), DeclWinFuncByORD_CACHE_survive(),
DeclWinFuncByORD_CACHE_resetError_survive(),
DeclWinFunc_CACHE(), DeclWinFunc_CACHE_resetError(),
DeclWinFunc_CACHE_survive(),
DeclWinFunc_CACHE_resetError_survive()</p>

<p>See the header files and the C code in the supplied
OS/2-related modules for the details on usage of these
functions.</p>

<p>Some of these functions also combine dynaloading
semantic with the error-propagation semantic discussed
above.</p>

<p>Perl flavors Because of idiosyncrasies of OS/2 one
cannot have all the eggs in the same basket (though EMX
environment tries hard to overcome this limitations, so the
situation may somehow improve). There are 4 executables for
Perl provided by the distribution:</p>

<p>perl.exe The main workhorse. This is a chimera
executable: it is compiled as an &quot;a.out&quot;-style
executable, but is linked with &quot;omf&quot;-style dynamic
library perl.dll, and with dynamic CRT DLL. This executable
is a VIO application.</p>

<p>It can load perl dynamic extensions, and it can
fork().</p>

<p>Note. Keep in mind that fork() is needed to open a pipe
to yourself.</p>

<p>perl_.exe This is a statically linked
&quot;a.out&quot;-style executable. It cannot load dynamic
Perl extensions. The executable supplied in binary
distributions has a lot of extensions prebuilt, thus the
above restriction is important only if you use custom-built
extensions. This executable is a VIO application.</p>

<p>This is the only executable with does not require OS/2.
The friends locked into &quot;M$&quot; world would
appreciate the fact that this executable runs under DOS,
Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT with an appropriate extender. See
&quot;Other OSes&quot;.</p>

<p>perl__.exe This is the same executable as perl___.exe,
but it is a PM application.</p>

<p>Note. Usually (unless explicitly redirected during the
startup) STDIN, STDERR, and STDOUT of a PM application are
redirected to nul. However, it is possible to see them if
you start &quot;perl__.exe&quot; from a PM program which
emulates a console window, like Shell mode of Emacs or EPM.
Thus it is possible to use Perl debugger (see perldebug) to
debug your PM application (but beware of the message loop
lockups - this will not work if you have a message queue to
serve, unless you hook the serving into the getc() function
of the debugger).</p>

<p>Another way to see the output of a PM program is to run
it as</p>

<p>pm_prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat -</p>

<p>with a shell different from cmd.exe, so that it does not
create a link between a VIO session and the session of
&quot;pm_porg&quot;. (Such a link closes the VIO window.)
E.g., this works with sh.exe - or with Perl!</p>

<p>open P, &rsquo;pm_prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 |&rsquo; or die;
print while &lt;P&gt;;</p>

<p>The flavor perl__.exe is required if you want to start
your program without a VIO window present, but not
&quot;detach&quot;ed (run &quot;help detach&quot; for more
info). Very useful for extensions which use PM, like
&quot;Perl/Tk&quot; or &quot;OpenGL&quot;.</p>

<p>Note also that the differences between PM and VIO
executables are only in the default behaviour. One can start
any executable in any kind of session by using the arguments
&quot;/fs&quot;, &quot;/pm&quot; or &quot;/win&quot;
switches of the command &quot;start&quot; (of CMD.EXE or a
similar shell). Alternatively, one can use the numeric first
argument of the &quot;system&quot; Perl function (see
OS2::Process).</p>

<p>perl___.exe This is an &quot;omf&quot;-style executable
which is dynamically linked to perl.dll and CRT DLL. I know
no advantages of this executable over &quot;perl.exe&quot;,
but it cannot fork() at all. Well, one advantage is that the
build process is not so convoluted as with
&quot;perl.exe&quot;.</p>

<p>It is a VIO application.</p>

<p>Why strange names? Since Perl processes the
&quot;#!&quot;-line (cf. &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; in perlrun,
&quot;Switches&quot; in perlrun, &quot;Not a perl
script&quot; in perldiag, &quot;No Perl script found in
input&quot; in perldiag), it should know when a program is a
Perl. There is some naming convention which allows Perl to
distinguish correct lines from wrong ones. The above names
are almost the only names allowed by this convention which
do not contain digits (which have absolutely different
semantics).</p>

<p>Why dynamic linking? Well, having several executables
dynamically linked to the same huge library has its
advantages, but this would not substantiate the additional
work to make it compile. The reason is the complicated-to-
developers but very quick and convenient-to-users
&quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking used by OS/2.</p>

<p>There are two distinctive features of the dyna-linking
model of OS/2: first, all the references to external
functions are resolved at the compile time; second, there is
no runtime fixup of the DLLs after they are loaded into
memory. The first feature is an enormous advantage over
other models: it avoids conflicts when several DLLs used by
an application export entries with the same name. In such
cases &quot;other&quot; models of dyna-linking just choose
between these two entry points using some random criterion -
with predictable disasters as results. But it is the second
feature which requires the build of perl.dll.</p>

<p>The address tables of DLLs are patched only once, when
they are loaded. The addresses of the entry points into DLLs
are guaranteed to be the same for all the programs which use
the same DLL. This removes the runtime fixup - once DLL is
loaded, its code is read-only.</p>

<p>While this allows some (significant?) performance
advantages, this makes life much harder for developers,
since the above scheme makes it impossible for a DLL to be
&quot;linked&quot; to a symbol in the .EXE file. Indeed,
this would need a DLL to have different relocations tables
for the (different) executables which use this DLL.</p>

<p>However, a dynamically loaded Perl extension is forced
to use some symbols from the perl executable, e.g., to know
how to find the arguments to the functions: the arguments
live on the perl internal evaluation stack. The solution is
to put the main code of the interpreter into a DLL, and make
the .EXE file which just loads this DLL into memory and
supplies command-arguments. The extension DLL cannot link to
symbols in .EXE, but it has no problem linking to symbols in
the .DLL.</p>

<p>This greatly increases the load time for the application
(as well as complexity of the compilation). Since
interpreter is in a DLL, the C RTL is basically forced to
reside in a DLL as well (otherwise extensions would not be
able to use CRT). There are some advantages if you use
different flavors of perl, such as running perl.exe and
perl__.exe simultaneously: they share the memory of
perl.dll.</p>

<p>NOTE. There is one additional effect which makes DLLs
more wasteful: DLLs are loaded in the shared memory region,
which is a scarse resource given the 512M barrier of the
&quot;standard&quot; OS/2 virtual memory. The code of .EXE
files is also shared by all the processes which use the
particular .EXE, but they are &quot;shared in the private
address space of the process&quot;; this is possible because
the address at which different sections of the .EXE file are
loaded is decided at compile-time, thus all the processes
have these sections loaded at same addresses, and no fixup
of internal links inside the .EXE is needed.</p>

<p>Since DLLs may be loaded at run time, to have the same
mechanism for DLLs one needs to have the address range of
any of the loaded DLLs in the system to be available in all
the processes which did not load a particular DLL yet. This
is why the DLLs are mapped to the shared memory region.</p>

<p>Why chimera build? Current EMX environment does not
allow DLLs compiled using Unixish &quot;a.out&quot; format
to export symbols for data (or at least some types of data).
This forces &quot;omf&quot;-style compile of perl.dll.</p>

<p>Current EMX environment does not allow .EXE files
compiled in &quot;omf&quot; format to fork(). fork() is
needed for exactly three Perl operations:</p>

<p>&middot; explicit fork() in the script,</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;open FH, &quot;|-&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;open FH, &quot;-|&quot;&quot;, in other
words, opening pipes to itself.</p>

<p>While these operations are not questions of life and
death, they are needed for a lot of useful scripts. This
forces &quot;a.out&quot;-style compile of perl.exe.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Here we list environment variables with are
either OS/2- and DOS- and Win*-specific, or are more
important under OS/2 than under other OSes.</p>

<p>&quot;PERLLIB_PREFIX&quot; Specific for EMX port. Should
have the form</p>

<p>path1;path2</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>path1 path2</p>

<p>If the beginning of some prebuilt path matches path1, it
is substituted with path2.</p>

<p>Should be used if the perl library is moved from the
default location in preference to &quot;PERL(5)LIB&quot;,
since this would not leave wrong entries in @INC. For
example, if the compiled version of perl looks for @INC in
f:/perllib/lib, and you want to install the library in
h:/opt/gnu, do</p>

<p>set PERLLIB_PREFIX=f:/perllib/lib;h:/opt/gnu</p>

<p>This will cause Perl with the prebuilt @INC of</p>

<p>f:/perllib/lib/5.00553/os2 f:/perllib/lib/5.00553
f:/perllib/lib/site_perl/5.00553/os2
f:/perllib/lib/site_perl/5.00553 .</p>

<p>to use the following @INC:</p>

<p>h:/opt/gnu/5.00553/os2 h:/opt/gnu/5.00553
h:/opt/gnu/site_perl/5.00553/os2
h:/opt/gnu/site_perl/5.00553 .</p>

<p>&quot;PERL_BADLANG&quot; If 0, perl ignores setlocale()
failing. May be useful with some strange locales.</p>

<p>&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; If 0, perl would not warn of in
case of unwarranted free(). With older perls this might be
useful in conjunction with the module DB_File, which was
buggy when dynamically linked and OMF-built.</p>

<p>Should not be set with newer Perls, since this may hide
some real problems.</p>

<p>&quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot; Specific for EMX port. Gives the
directory part of the location for sh.exe.</p>

<p>&quot;USE_PERL_FLOCK&quot; Specific for EMX port. Since
flock(3) is present in EMX, but is not functional, it is
emulated by perl. To disable the emulations, set environment
variable &quot;USE_PERL_FLOCK=0&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;TMP&quot; or &quot;TEMP&quot; Specific for EMX
port. Used as storage place for temporary files.</p>

<p>Evolution Here we list major changes which could make
you by surprise.</p>

<p>Text-mode filehandles Starting from version 5.8, Perl
uses a builtin translation layer for text-mode files. This
replaces the efficient well-tested EMX layer by some code
which should be best characterized as a &quot;quick
hack&quot;.</p>

<p>In addition to possible bugs and an inability to follow
changes to the translation policy with off/on switches of
TERMIO translation, this introduces a serious incompatible
change: before sysread() on text-mode filehandles would go
through the translation layer, now it would not.</p>

<p>Priorities &quot;setpriority&quot; and
&quot;getpriority&quot; are not compatible with earlier
ports by Andreas Kaiser. See &quot;setpriority,
getpriority&quot;.</p>

<p>DLL name mangling: pre 5.6.2 With the release 5.003_01
the dynamically loadable libraries should be rebuilt when a
different version of Perl is compiled. In particular, DLLs
(including perl.dll) are now created with the names which
contain a checksum, thus allowing workaround for OS/2 scheme
of caching DLLs.</p>

<p>It may be possible to code a simple workaround which
would</p>

<p>&middot; find the old DLLs looking through the old
@INC;</p>

<p>&middot; mangle the names according to the scheme of new
perl and copy the DLLs to these names;</p>

<p>&middot; edit the internal &quot;LX&quot; tables of DLL
to reflect the change of the name (probably not needed for
Perl extension DLLs, since the internally coded names are
not used for &quot;specific&quot; DLLs, they used only for
&quot;global&quot; DLLs).</p>

<p>&middot; edit the internal &quot;IMPORT&quot; tables and
change the name of the &quot;old&quot; perl????.dll to the
&quot;new&quot; perl????.dll.</p>

<p>DLL name mangling: 5.6.2 and beyond In fact mangling of
extension DLLs was done due to misunderstanding of the OS/2
dynaloading model. OS/2 (effectively) maintains two
different tables of loaded DLL:</p>

<p>Global DLLs those loaded by the base name from
&quot;LIBPATH&quot;; including those associated at link
time;</p>

<p>specific DLLs loaded by the full name.</p>

<p>When resolving a request for a global DLL, the table of
already-loaded specific DLLs is (effectively) ignored;
moreover, specific DLLs are always loaded from the
prescribed path.</p>

<p>There is/was a minor twist which makes this scheme
fragile: what to do with DLLs loaded from</p>

<p>&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot; and &quot;ENDLIBPATH&quot;
(which depend on the process)</p>

<p>. from &quot;LIBPATH&quot; which effectively depends on
the process (although &quot;LIBPATH&quot; is the same for
all the processes).</p>

<p>Unless &quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot; is set to &quot;T&quot;
(and the kernel is after 2000/09/01), such DLLs are
considered to be global. When loading a global DLL it is
first looked in the table of already-loaded global DLLs.
Because of this the fact that one executable loaded a DLL
from &quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot; and &quot;ENDLIBPATH&quot;, or
. from &quot;LIBPATH&quot; may affect which DLL is loaded
when another executable requests a DLL with the same name.
This is the reason for version-specific mangling of the DLL
name for perl DLL.</p>

<p>Since the Perl extension DLLs are always loaded with the
full path, there is no need to mangle their names in a
version-specific ways: their directory already reflects the
corresponding version of perl, and @INC takes into account
binary compatibility with older version. Starting from 5.6.2
the name mangling scheme is fixed to be the same as for Perl
5.005_53 (same as in a popular binary release). Thus new
Perls will be able to resolve the names of old extension
DLLs if @INC allows finding their directories.</p>

<p>However, this still does not guarantee that these DLL
may be loaded. The reason is the mangling of the name of the
Perl DLL. And since the extension DLLs link with the Perl
DLL, extension DLLs for older versions would load an older
Perl DLL, and would most probably segfault (since the data
in this DLL is not properly initialized).</p>

<p>There is a partial workaround (which can be made
complete with newer OS/2 kernels): create a forwarder DLL
with the same name as the DLL of the older version of Perl,
which forwards the entry points to the newer Perl s DLL.
Make this DLL accessible on (say) the
&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot; of the new Perl executable. When
the new executable accesses old Perls extension DLLs, they
would request the old Perl s DLL by name, get the forwarder
instead, so effectively will link with the currently running
(new) Perl DLL.</p>

<p>This may break in two ways:</p>

<p>&middot; Old perl executable is started when a new
executable is running has loaded an extension compiled for
the old executable (ouph!). In this case the old executable
will get a forwarder DLL instead of the old perl DLL, so
would link with the new perl DLL. While not directly fatal,
it will behave the same as new executable. This beats the
whole purpose of explicitly starting an old executable.</p>

<p>&middot; A new executable loads an extension compiled
for the old executable when an old perl executable is
running. In this case the extension will not pick up the
forwarder - with fatal results.</p>

<p>With support for &quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot; this may be
circumvented - unless one of DLLs is started from . from
&quot;LIBPATH&quot; (I do not know whether
&quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot; affects this case).</p>

<p>REMARK. Unless newer kernels allow . in
&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot; (older do not), this mess cannot be
completely cleaned. (It turns out that as of the beginning
of 2002, . is not allowed, but .. is - and it has the same
effect.)</p>

<p>REMARK. &quot;LIBPATHSTRICT&quot;,
&quot;BEGINLIBPATH&quot; and &quot;ENDLIBPATH&quot; are not
environment variables, although cmd.exe emulates them on
&quot;SET ...&quot; lines. From Perl they may be accessed by
Cwd::extLibpath and Cwd::extLibpath_set.</p>

<p>DLL forwarder generation Assume that the old DLL is
named perlE0AC.dll (as is one for 5.005_53), and the new
version is 5.6.1. Create a file perl5shim.def-leader
with</p>

<p>LIBRARY &rsquo;perlE0AC&rsquo; INITINSTANCE TERMINSTANCE
DESCRIPTION &rsquo;@#perl5-porters@perl.org:5.006001#@ Perl
module for 5.00553 -&gt; Perl 5.6.1 forwarder&rsquo; CODE
LOADONCALL DATA LOADONCALL NONSHARED MULTIPLE EXPORTS</p>

<p>modifying the versions/names as needed. Run</p>

<p>perl -wnle &quot;next if 0../EXPORTS/; print qq(</p>

<p>in the Perl build directory (to make the DLL smaller
replace perl5.def with the definition file for the older
version of Perl if present).</p>

<p>cat perl5shim.def-leader lst &gt;perl5shim.def gcc -Zomf
-Zdll -o perlE0AC.dll perl5shim.def -s -llibperl</p>

<p>(ignore multiple &quot;warning L4085&quot;).</p>

<p>Threading As of release 5.003_01 perl is linked to
multithreaded C RTL DLL. If perl itself is not compiled
multithread-enabled, so will not be perls malloc(). However,
extensions may use multiple thread on their own risk.</p>

<p>This was needed to compile &quot;Perl/Tk&quot; for
XFree86-OS/2 out-of-the-box, and link with DLLs for other
useful libraries, which typically are compiled with
&quot;-Zmt -Zcrtdll&quot;.</p>

<p>Calls to external programs Due to a popular demand the
perl external program calling has been changed wrt Andreas
Kaisers port. If perl needs to call an external program via
shell, the f:/bin/sh.exe will be called, or whatever is the
override, see &quot;PERL_SH_DIR&quot;.</p>

<p>Thus means that you need to get some copy of a sh.exe as
well (I use one from pdksh). The path F:/bin above is set up
automatically during the build to a correct value on the
builder machine, but is overridable at runtime,</p>

<p>Reasons: a consensus on &quot;perl5-porters&quot; was
that perl should use one non-overridable shell per platform.
The obvious choices for OS/2 are cmd.exe and sh.exe. Having
perl build itself would be impossible with cmd.exe as a
shell, thus I picked up &quot;sh.exe&quot;. This assures
almost 100% compatibility with the scripts coming from *nix.
As an added benefit this works as well under DOS if you use
DOS-enabled port of pdksh (see
&quot;Prerequisites&quot;).</p>

<p>Disadvantages: currently sh.exe of pdksh calls external
programs via fork()/exec(), and there is no functioning
exec() on OS/2. exec() is emulated by EMX by an asynchronous
call while the caller waits for child completion (to pretend
that the &quot;pid&quot; did not change). This means that 1
extra copy of sh.exe is made active via fork()/exec(), which
may lead to some resources taken from the system (even if we
do not count extra work needed for fork()ing).</p>

<p>Note that this a lesser issue now when we do not spawn
sh.exe unless needed (metachars found).</p>

<p>One can always start cmd.exe explicitly via</p>

<p>system &rsquo;cmd&rsquo;, &rsquo;/c&rsquo;,
&rsquo;mycmd&rsquo;, &rsquo;arg1&rsquo;, &rsquo;arg2&rsquo;,
...</p>

<p>If you need to use cmd.exe, and do not want to hand-edit
thousands of your scripts, the long-term solution proposed
on p5-p is to have a directive</p>

<p>use OS2::Cmd;</p>

<p>which will override system(), exec(),
&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;, and
&quot;open(,&rsquo;...|&rsquo;)&quot;. With current perl you
may override only system(), readpipe() - the explicit
version of &quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;, and maybe exec(). The
code will substitute the one- argument call to system() by
&quot;CORE::system(&rsquo;cmd.exe&rsquo;, &rsquo;/c&rsquo;,
shift)&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have some working code for &quot;OS2::Cmd&quot;,
please send it to me, I will include it into distribution. I
have no need for such a module, so cannot test it.</p>

<p>For the details of the current situation with calling
external programs, see &quot;2 (and DOS) programs under
Perl&quot; in Starting OS. Set us mention a couple of
features:</p>

<p>&middot; External scripts may be called by their
basename. Perl will try the same extensions as when
processing -S command-line switch.</p>

<p>&middot; External scripts starting with &quot;#!&quot;
or &quot;extproc &quot; will be executed directly, without
calling the shell, by calling the program specified on the
rest of the first line.</p>

<p>Memory allocation Perl uses its own malloc() under OS/2
- interpreters are usually malloc-bound for speed, but perl
is not, since its malloc is lightning- fast.
Perl-memory-usage-tuned benchmarks show that Perl s malloc
is 5 times quicker than EMX one. I do not have convincing
data about memory footprint, but a (pretty random) benchmark
showed that Perls one is 5% better.</p>

<p>Combination of perl s malloc() and rigid DLL name
resolution creates a special problem with library functions
which expect their return value to be free()d by systems
free(). To facilitate extensions which need to call such
functions, system memory-allocation functions are still
available with the prefix &quot;emx_&quot; added. (Currently
only DLL perl has this, it should propagate to perl_.exe
shortly.)</p>

<p>Threads One can build perl with thread support enabled
by providing &quot;-D usethreads&quot; option to Configure.
Currently OS/2 support of threads is very preliminary.</p>

<p>Most notable problems:</p>

<p>&quot;COND_WAIT&quot; may have a race condition (but
probably does not due to edge- triggered nature of OS/2
Event semaphores). (Needs a reimplementation (in terms of
chaining waiting threads, with the linked list stored in
per-thread structure?)?)</p>

<p>os2.c has a couple of static variables used in
OS/2-specific functions. (Need to be moved to per-thread
structure, or serialized?)</p>

<p>Note that these problems should not discourage
experimenting, since they have a low probability of
affecting small programs.</p>

5.6.1?), see ./os2/Changes (perlos2delta) for more info.</p>
