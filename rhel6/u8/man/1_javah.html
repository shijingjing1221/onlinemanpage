<p>NAME javah - Generates C header and source files from a
Java class.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS javah [ options ] fully-qualified-class-name
...</p>

<p>options The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>fully-qualified-class-name The fully qualified location
of the classes to be converted to C header and source
files.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The javah command generates C header and
source files that are needed to implement native methods.
The generated header and source files are used by C programs
to reference an object s instance variables from native
source code. The .h file contains a struct definition with a
layout that parallels the layout of the corresponding class.
The fields in the struct correspond to instance variables in
the class.</p>

<p>The name of the header file and the structure declared
within it are derived from the name of the class. When the
class passed to the javah command is inside a package, the
package name is added to the beginning of both the header
file name and the structure name. Underscores (_) are used
as name delimiters.</p>

<p>By default the javah command creates a header file for
each class listed on the command line and puts the files in
the current directory. Use the -stubs option to create
source files. Use the -o option to concatenate the results
for all listed classes into a single file.</p>

<p>The Java Native Interface (JNI) does not require header
information or stub files. The javah command can still be
used to generate native method function prototypes needed
for JNI-style native methods. The javah command produces
JNI-style output by default and places the result in the .h
file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o outputfile Concatenates the resulting header
or source files for all the classes listed on the command
line into an output file. Only one of -o or -d can be
used.</p>

<p>-d directory Sets the directory where the javah command
saves the header files or the stub files. Only one of -d or
-o can be used.</p>

<p>-stubs Causes the javah command to generate C
declarations from the Java object file.</p>

<p>-verbose Indicates verbose output and causes the javah
command to print a message to stdout about the status of the
generated files.</p>

<p>-help Prints a help message for javah usage.</p>

<p>-version Prints javah command release information.</p>

<p>-jni Causes the javah command to create an output file
containing JNI-style native method function prototypes. This
is the default output; use of -jni is optional.</p>

<p>-classpath path Specifies the path the javah command
uses to look up classes. Overrides the default or the
CLASSPATH environment variable when it is set. Directories
are separated by colons on Oracle Solaris and semicolons on
Windows. The general format for path is:</p>

<p>Oracle Solaris:</p>

<p>.:your-path</p>

<p>Example: .:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes</p>

<p>Windows:</p>

<p>.;your-path</p>

<p>Example: .;Cuserdac As a special convenience, a class
path element that contains a base name of * is considered
equivalent to specifying a list of all the files in the
directory with the extension .jar or .JAR.</p>

<p>For example, if directory mydir contains a.jar and
b.JAR, then the class path element mydir/* is expanded to a
A.jar:b.JAR, except that the order of jar files is
unspecified. All JAR files in the specified directory,
including hidden ones, are included in the list. A class
path entry that consists of * expands to a list of all the
JAR files in the current directory. The CLASSPATH
environment variable, where defined, is similarly expanded.
Any class path wild card expansion occurs before the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) is started. A Java program will never
see unexpanded wild cards except by querying the
environment. For example, by calling
System.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).</p>

<p>-bootclasspath path Specifies the path from which to
load bootstrap classes. By default, the bootstrap classes
are the classes that implement rt.jar and the core Java
platform located in jrib several other JAR files.</p>

<p>-old Specifies that old JDK 1.0-style header files
should be generated.</p>

<p>-force Specifies that output files should always be
written.</p>

<p>-Joption Passes option to the Java Virtual Machine,
where option is one of the options described on the
reference page for the Java application launcher. For
example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 MB. See
java(1).</p>
