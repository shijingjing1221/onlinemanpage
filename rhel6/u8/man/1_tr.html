<p>NAME tr - translate or delete characters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters
from standard input, writ- ing to standard output.</p>

<p>-c, -C, --complement use the complement of SET1</p>

<p>-d, --delete delete characters in SET1, do not
translate</p>

<p>-s, --squeeze-repeats replace each input sequence of a
repeated character that is listed in SET1 with a single
occurrence of that character</p>

<p>-t, --truncate-set1 first truncate SET1 to length of
SET2</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>SETs are specified as strings of characters. Most
represent them- selves. Interpreted sequences are:</p>

<p>character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)</p>

<p>\ backslash</p>

<p>audible BEL</p>

<p>backspace</p>

<p>form feed</p>

<p>new line</p>

<p>return</p>

<p>horizontal tab</p>

<p>vertical tab</p>

<p>CHAR1-CHAR2 all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in
ascending order</p>

<p>[CHAR*] in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1</p>

<p>[CHAR*REPEAT] REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if
starting with 0</p>

<p>[:alnum:] all letters and digits</p>

<p>[:alpha:] all letters</p>

<p>[:blank:] all horizontal whitespace</p>

<p>[:cntrl:] all control characters</p>

<p>[:digit:] all digits</p>

<p>[:graph:] all printable characters, not including
space</p>

<p>[:lower:] all lower case letters</p>

<p>[:print:] all printable characters, including space</p>

<p>[:punct:] all punctuation characters</p>

<p>[:space:] all horizontal or vertical whitespace</p>

<p>[:upper:] all upper case letters</p>

<p>[:xdigit:] all hexadecimal digits</p>

<p>[=CHAR=] all characters which are equivalent to CHAR</p>

<p>Translation occurs if -d is not given and both SET1 and
SET2 appear. -t may be used only when translating. SET2 is
extended to length of SET1 by repeating its last character
as necessary. Excess characters of SET2 are ignored. Only
[:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to expand in
ascending order; used in SET2 while translating, they may
only be used in pairs to specify case conversion. -s uses
SET1 if not translating nor deleting; else squeezing uses
SET2 and occurs after translation or deletion.</p>
