<p>NAME gpg-preset-passphrase - Put a passphrase into
gpg-agent s cache</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpg-preset-passphrase [options] [command]
cache-id</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gpg-preset-passphrase is a utility to
seed the internal cache of a running gpg-agent with
passphrases. It is mainly useful for unattended machines,
where the usual pinentry tool may not be used and the
passphrases for the to be used keys are given at machine
startup.</p>

<p>Passphrases set with this utility dont expire unless the
--forget option is used to explicitly clear them from the
cache --- or gpg-agent is either restarted or reloaded (by
sending a SIGHUP to it). It is necessary to allow this
passphrase presetting by starting gpg-agent with the
--allow-preset-passphrase.</p>

<p>gpg-preset-passphrase is invoked this way:</p>

<p>gpg-preset-passphrase [options] [command] cacheid</p>

<p>cacheid is either a 40 character keygrip of hexadecimal
characters identifying the key for which the passphrase
should be set or cleared. The keygrip is listed along with
the key when running the command: gpgsm --dump-secret-keys.
Alternatively an arbitrary string may be used to identify a
passphrase; it is suggested that such a string is prefixed
with the name of the application (e.g foo:12346).</p>

<p>One of the following command options must be given:</p>

<p>--preset Preset a passphrase. This is what you usually
will use. gpg-pre- set-passphrase will then read the
passphrase from stdin.</p>

<p>--forget Flush the passphrase for the given cache ID
from the cache.</p>

<p>The following additional options may be used:</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Output additional information while
running.</p>

<p>-P string</p>

<p>--passphrase string Instead of reading the passphrase
from stdin, use the supplied string as passphrase. Note that
this makes the passphrase visi- ble for other users.</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a
Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual including
a menu struc- ture and an index.</p>
