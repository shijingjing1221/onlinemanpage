<p>ROUND_JIFFIES(9) Driver Basics ROUND_JIFFIES(9)</p>

<p>NAME round_jiffies - function to round jiffies to a full
second</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS unsigned long round_jiffies(unsigned long
j);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS j the time in (absolute) jiffies that should
be rounded</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION round_jiffies rounds an absolute time in the
future (in jiffies) up or down to (approximately) full
seconds. This is useful for timers for which the exact time
they fire does not matter too much, as long as they fire
approximately every X seconds.</p>

<p>By rounding these timers to whole seconds, all such
timers will fire at the same time, rather than at various
times spread out. The goal of this is to have the CPU wake
up less, which saves power.</p>

<p>The return value is the rounded version of the j
parameter.</p>
