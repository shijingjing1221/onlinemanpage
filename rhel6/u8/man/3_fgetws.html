<p>FGETWS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FGETWS(3)</p>

<p>NAME fgetws - read a wide-character string from a FILE
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *fgetws(wchar_t *ws, int n, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fgetws() function is the wide-character
equivalent of the fgets(3) function. It reads a string of at
most n-1 wide characters into the wide-character array
pointed to by ws, and adds a terminating L&rsquo; &rsquo;
character. It stops reading wide characters after it has
encountered and stored a newline wide character. It also
stops when end of stream is reached.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least n wide char- acters at ws.</p>

<p>For a non-locking counterpart, see
unlocked_stdio(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The fgetws() function, if successful,
returns ws. If end of stream was already reached or if an
error occurred, it returns NULL.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of fgetws() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>In the absence of additional information passed to the
fopen(3) call, it is reasonable to expect that fgetws() will
actually read a multibyte string from the stream and then
convert it to a wide-character string.</p>

<p>This function is unreliable, because it does not permit
to deal prop- erly with null wide characters that may be
present in the input.</p>
