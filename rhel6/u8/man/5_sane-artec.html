<p>sane-artec(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-artec(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-artec - SANE backend for Artec flatbed
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-artec library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Artec/Ultima SCSI flatbed scanners. At present, the
following scanners are known to work at least partially with
this backend:</p>

<p>* Artec A6000C * Artec A6000C PLUS * Artec ViewStation
AT3 * BlackWidow BW4800SP (rebadged Artec AT3) * Artec
ViewStation AT6 * Artec ViewStation AT12 * Artec AM12S *
Plustek 19200S (rebadged Artec AM12S)</p>

<p>Although this manual page is generally updated with each
release, up- to-date information on new releases and
extraneous helpful hints are available from the backend
homepage: http://www4.infi.net/~cpinkham/sane/</p>

<p>DOCUMENTATION CONFIGURATION The contents of the
artec.conf file are a list of device names that correspond
to Artec scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with a
hash mark (#) are ignored. See sane-scsi(5) on details of
what consti- tutes a valid device name.</p>

<p>Sample file: # artec.conf # # this is a comment. # #
this line says search for any SCSI devices which are
scanners and have # a vendor string of ULTIMA scsi ULTIMA #
# the next line forces the backend to assume the next
scanner found has # the specified vendor string (useful for
testing rebadged models). vendor ULTIMA # # the next line
forces the backend to assume the next scanner found has #
the specified model string (useful for testing rebadged
models). model AT3 # # now a line that actually specifies a
device. The backend is going to # assume this is an
Artec/Ultima AT3 because we forced the vendor and # model
above. /dev/scanner # # once we hit a scanner device line,
the forced vendor and model # string are # forgotten, so the
vendor and model for this next device will be # determined
from the result of a SCSI inquiry. /dev/sge #</p>

<p>SCSI ADAPTER TIPS Some Artec scanners come with an
included SCSI adapter. If your scan- ner came with a DTC ISA
scsi cards, you can probably use it with recent (&gt;=
2.2.0) kernels using the generic NCR5380 support. You must
pass the following boot argument to the kernel:
&quot;dtc3181e=0x2c0,0&quot; I do not have any information
on the PCI SCSI adapter included with some newer Artec
scanners.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/artec.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-artec.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-artec.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi- colon (;). If this variable is not set, the con-
figuration file is searched in two default directories:
first, the current working direc- tory (&quot;.&quot;) and
then in /etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment
variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly
specified directories. For example, set- ting
SANE_CONFIG_DIR to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in
directo- ries &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity: SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC values</p>

raw data from scanner to artec.data.raw file</p>

<p>== 128 print out all messages</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC=13</p>

<p>BUGS Known bugs in this release: A6000C+ users with
firmware v1.92 or ear- lier have problems with the backend,
the cause has not been determined. Sometimes the backend is
not particularly robust, you can possibly lock up the SCSI
bus (and/or machine) by not having patience enough when
scanning. 3-channel gamma correction is not implemented and
single- channel gamma correction is not totally working on
models other than the AT3.</p>
