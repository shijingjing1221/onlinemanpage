<p>NAME perllol - Manipulating Arrays of Arrays in Perl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Declaration and Access of Arrays of Arrays
The simplest thing to build is an array of arrays (sometimes
imprecisely called a list of lists). Its reasonably easy to
understand, and almost everything that applies here will
also be applicable later on with the fancier data
structures.</p>

<p>An array of an array is just a regular old array @AoA
that you can get at with two subscripts, like $AoA[3][2].
Here s a declaration of the array:</p>

<p># assign to our array, an array of array references @AoA
= ( [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot; ], [
&quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot; ], [
&quot;homer&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;bart&quot; ],
);</p>

<p>print $AoA[2][2]; bart</p>

<p>Now you should be very careful that the outer bracket
type is a round one, that is, a parenthesis. That s because
you re assigning to an @array, so you need parentheses. If
you wanted there not to be an @AoA, but rather just a
reference to it, you could do something more like this:</p>

<p># assign a reference to array of array references
$ref_to_AoA = [ [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;,
&quot;pebbles&quot;, &quot;bambam&quot;, &quot;dino&quot;,
], [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;bart&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;,
&quot;maggie&quot;, ], [ &quot;george&quot;,
&quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot;, &quot;judy&quot;, ],
];</p>

<p>print $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2][2];</p>

<p>Notice that the outer bracket type has changed, and so
our access syntax has also changed. Thats because unlike C,
in perl you cant freely interchange arrays and references
thereto. $ref_to_AoA is a reference to an array, whereas
@AoA is an array proper. Likewise, $AoA[2] is not an array,
but an array ref. So how come you can write these:</p>

<p>$AoA[2][2] $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2][2]</p>

<p>instead of having to write these:</p>

<p>$AoA[2]-&gt;[2] $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2]-&gt;[2]</p>

<p>Well, thats because the rule is that on adjacent
brackets only (whether square or curly), you are free to
omit the pointer dereferencing arrow. But you cannot do so
for the very first one if its a scalar containing a
reference, which means that $ref_to_AoA always needs it.</p>

<p>Growing Your Own That s all well and good for
declaration of a fixed data structure, but what if you
wanted to add new elements on the fly, or build it up
entirely from scratch?</p>

<p>First, let s look at reading it in from a file. This is
something like adding a row at a time. Well assume that
there s a flat file in which each line is a row and each
word an element. If youre trying to develop an @AoA array
containing all these, here s the right way to do that:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { @tmp = split; push @AoA, [ @tmp ];
}</p>

<p>You might also have loaded that from a function:</p>

<p>for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) { $AoA[$i] = [ somefunc($i) ]; }</p>

<p>Or you might have had a temporary variable sitting
around with the array in it.</p>

<p>for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) { @tmp = somefunc($i); $AoA[$i] = [
@tmp ]; }</p>

<p>Its very important that you make sure to use the
&quot;[]&quot; array reference constructor. Thats because
this will be very wrong:</p>

<p>$AoA[$i] = @tmp;</p>

<p>You see, assigning a named array like that to a scalar
just counts the number of elements in @tmp, which probably
isnt what you want.</p>

<p>If you are running under &quot;use strict&quot;, youll
have to add some declarations to make it happy:</p>

<p>use strict; my(@AoA, @tmp); while (&lt;&gt;) { @tmp =
split; push @AoA, [ @tmp ]; }</p>

<p>Of course, you dont need the temporary array to have a
name at all:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { push @AoA, [ split ]; }</p>

<p>You also dont have to use push(). You could just make a
direct assignment if you knew where you wanted to put
it:</p>

<p>my (@AoA, $i, $line); for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) { $line =
&lt;&gt;; $AoA[$i] = [ split &rsquo; &rsquo;, $line ]; }</p>

<p>or even just</p>

<p>my (@AoA, $i); for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) { $AoA[$i] = [ split
&rsquo; &rsquo;, &lt;&gt; ]; }</p>

<p>You should in general be leery of using functions that
could potentially return lists in scalar context without
explicitly stating such. This would be clearer to the casual
reader:</p>

<p>my (@AoA, $i); for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) { $AoA[$i] = [ split
&rsquo; &rsquo;, scalar(&lt;&gt;) ]; }</p>

<p>If you wanted to have a $ref_to_AoA variable as a
reference to an array, youd have to do something like
this:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { push @$ref_to_AoA, [ split ]; }</p>

<p>Now you can add new rows. What about adding new columns?
If youre dealing with just matrices, it s often easiest to
use simple assignment:</p>

<p>for $x (1 .. 10) { for $y (1 .. 10) { $AoA[$x][$y] =
func($x, $y); } }</p>

<p>for $x ( 3, 7, 9 ) { $AoA[$x][20] += func2($x); }</p>

<p>It doesnt matter whether those elements are already
there or not: itll gladly create them for you, setting
intervening elements to &quot;undef&quot; as need be.</p>

<p>If you wanted just to append to a row, youd have to do
something a bit funnier looking:</p>

<p># add new columns to an existing row push @{ $AoA[0] },
&quot;wilma&quot;, &quot;betty&quot;;</p>

<p>Notice that I couldnt say just:</p>

<p>push $AoA[0], &quot;wilma&quot;, &quot;betty&quot;; #
WRONG!</p>

<p>In fact, that wouldnt even compile. How come? Because
the argument to push() must be a real array, not just a
reference to such.</p>

<p>Access and Printing Now its time to print your data
structure out. How are you going to do that? Well, if you
want only one of the elements, its trivial:</p>

<p>print $AoA[0][0];</p>

<p>If you want to print the whole thing, though, you cant
say</p>

<p>print @AoA; # WRONG</p>

<p>because you ll get just references listed, and perl will
never automatically dereference things for you. Instead, you
have to roll yourself a loop or two. This prints the whole
structure, using the shell-style for() construct to loop
across the outer set of subscripts.</p>

<p>for $aref ( @AoA ) { print &quot; [ @$aref ],0; }</p>

<p>If you wanted to keep track of subscripts, you might do
this:</p>

<p>for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) { print &quot; elt $i is [
@{$AoA[$i]} ],0; }</p>

<p>or maybe even this. Notice the inner loop.</p>

<p>for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) { for $j ( 0 .. $#{$AoA[$i]} ) {
print &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]0; } }</p>

<p>As you can see, its getting a bit complicated. Thats why
sometimes is easier to take a temporary on your way
through:</p>

<p>for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) { $aref = $AoA[$i]; for $j ( 0 ..
$#{$aref} ) { print &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]0; }
}</p>

<p>Hmm... thats still a bit ugly. How about this:</p>

<p>for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) { $aref = $AoA[$i]; $n = @$aref -
1; for $j ( 0 .. $n ) { print &quot;elt $i $j is
$AoA[$i][$j]0; } }</p>

<p>Slices If you want to get at a slice (part of a row) in
a multidimensional array, youre going to have to do some
fancy subscripting. Thats because while we have a nice
synonym for single elements via the pointer arrow for
dereferencing, no such convenience exists for slices.
(Remember, of course, that you can always write a loop to do
a slice operation.)</p>

<p>Heres how to do one operation using a loop. We ll assume
an @AoA variable as before.</p>

<p>@part = (); $x = 4; for ($y = 7; $y &lt; 13; $y++) {
push @part, $AoA[$x][$y]; }</p>

<p>That same loop could be replaced with a slice
operation:</p>

<p>@part = @{ $AoA[4] } [ 7..12 ];</p>

<p>but as you might well imagine, this is pretty rough on
the reader.</p>

<p>Ah, but what if you wanted a two-dimensional slice, such
as having $x run from 4..8 and $y run from 7 to 12? Hmm...
heres the simple way:</p>

<p>@newAoA = (); for ($startx = $x = 4; $x &lt;= 8; $x++) {
for ($starty = $y = 7; $y &lt;= 12; $y++) { $newAoA[$x -
$startx][$y - $starty] = $AoA[$x][$y]; } }</p>

<p>We can reduce some of the looping through slices</p>

<p>for ($x = 4; $x &lt;= 8; $x++) { push @newAoA, [ @{
$AoA[$x] } [ 7..12 ] ]; }</p>

<p>If you were into Schwartzian Transforms, you would
probably have selected map for that</p>

<p>@newAoA = map { [ @{ $AoA[$_] } [ 7..12 ] ] } 4 ..
8;</p>

<p>Although if your manager accused you of seeking job
security (or rapid insecurity) through inscrutable code, it
would be hard to argue. :-) If I were you, Id put that in a
function:</p>

<p>@newAoA = splice_2D( @AoA, 4 =&gt; 8, 7 =&gt; 12 ); sub
splice_2D { my $lrr = shift; # ref to array of array refs!
my ($x_lo, $x_hi, $y_lo, $y_hi) = @_;</p>

<p>return map { [ @{ $lrr-&gt;[$_] } [ $y_lo .. $y_hi ] ] }
$x_lo .. $x_hi; }</p>
