<p>Tk_CreateWindow(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_CreateWindow(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CreateWindow, Tk_CreateWindowFromPath,
Tk_DestroyWindow, Tk_MakeWin- dowExist - create or delete
window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_Window Tk_CreateWindow(interp, parent, name,
topLevScreen)</p>

<p>Tk_Window Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow(interp, parent,
topLevScreen)</p>

<p>Tk_Window Tk_CreateWindowFromPath(interp, tkwin,
pathName, topLevScreen)</p>

<p>Tk_DestroyWindow(tkwin)</p>

<p>Tk_MakeWindowExist(tkwin)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (out) Tcl interpreter to
use for error reporting. If no error occurs, then *interp is
not modified.</p>

<p>Tk_Window parent (in) Token for the window that is to
serve as the logical parent of the new window.</p>

<p>const char *name (in) Name to use for this window. Must
be unique among all chil- dren of the same parent.</p>

<p>const char *topLevScreen (in) Has same format as
screenName. If NULL, then new window is cre- ated as an
internal window. If non-NULL, new window is created as a
top-level window on screen topLevScreen. If topLevScreen is
an empty string () then new window is created as top-level
window of parents screen.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window.</p>

<p>const char *pathName (in) Name of new window, specified
as path name within application (e.g. .a.b.c).

<p>DESCRIPTION The procedures Tk_CreateWindow,
Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow, and Tk_Cre- ateWindowFromPath are
used to create new windows for use in Tk-based applications.
Each of the procedures returns a token that can be used to
manipulate the window in other calls to the Tk library. If
the win- dow could not be created successfully, then NULL is
returned and interp-&gt;result is modified to hold an error
message.</p>

<p>Tk supports two different kinds of windows: internal
windows and top- level windows. An internal window is an
interior window of a Tk application, such as a scrollbar or
menu bar or button. A top-level window is one that is
created as a child of a screen s root window, rather than as
an interior window, but which is logically part of some
existing main window. Examples of top-level windows are
pop-up menus and dialog boxes.</p>

<p>New windows may be created by calling Tk_CreateWindow.
If the topLevScreen argument is NULL, then the new window
will be an internal window. If topLevScreen is non-NULL,
then the new window will be a top-level window: topLevScreen
indicates the name of a screen and the new window will be
created as a child of the root window of topLevScreen. In
either case Tk will consider the new window to be the
logical child of parent: the new windows path name will
reflect this fact, options may be specified for the new
window under this assump- tion, and so on. The only
difference is that new X window for a top- level window will
not be a child of parents X window. For example, a pull-down
menu s parent would be the button-like window used to invoke
it, which would in turn be a child of the menu bar window. A
dialog box might have the applications main window as its
parent.</p>

<p>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow differs from Tk_CreateWindow in
that it cre- ates an unnamed window. This window will be
manipulable only using C interfaces, and will not be visible
to Tcl scripts. Both interior win- dows and top-level
windows may be created with Tk_CreateAnonymousWin- dow.</p>

<p>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath offers an alternate way of
specifying new win- dows. In Tk_CreateWindowFromPath the new
window is specified with a token for any window in the
target application (tkwin), plus a path name for the new
window. It produces the same effect as Tk_CreateWin- dow and
allows both top-level and internal windows to be created,
depending on the value of topLevScreen. In calls to
Tk_CreateWin- dowFromPath, as in calls to Tk_CreateWindow,
the parent of the new win- dow must exist at the time of the
call, but the new window must not already exist.</p>

<p>The window creation procedures do not actually issue the
command to X to create a window. Instead, they create a
local data structure asso- ciated with the window and defer
the creation of the X window. The window will actually be
created by the first call to Tk_MapWindow. Deferred window
creation allows various aspects of the window (such as its
size, background color, etc.) to be modified after its
creation without incurring any overhead in the X server.
When the window is finally mapped all of the window
attributes can be set while creating the window.</p>

<p>The value returned by a window-creation procedure is not
the X token for the window (it cannot be, since X has not
been asked to create the window yet). Instead, it is a token
for Tks local data structure for the window. Most of the Tk
library procedures take Tk_Window tokens, rather than X
identifiers. The actual X window identifier can be retrieved
from the local data structure using the Tk_WindowId macro;
see the manual entry for Tk_WindowId for details.</p>

<p>Tk_DestroyWindow deletes a window and all the data
structures associ- ated with it, including any event
handlers created with Tk_CreateEven- tHandler. In addition,
Tk_DestroyWindow will delete any children of tkwin
recursively (where children are defined in the Tk sense,
consist- ing of all windows that were created with the given
window as parent). If tkwin is an internal window, then
event handlers interested in destroy events are invoked
immediately. If tkwin is a top-level or main window, then
the event handlers will be invoked later, after X has seen
the request and returned an event for it.</p>

<p>If a window has been created but has not been mapped, so
no X window exists, it is possible to force the creation of
the X window by calling Tk_MakeWindowExist. This procedure
issues the X commands to instanti- ate the window given by
tkwin.</p>
