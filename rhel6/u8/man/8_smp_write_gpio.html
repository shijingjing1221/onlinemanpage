<p>SMP_WRITE_GPIO(8) SMP_UTILS SMP_WRITE_GPIO(8)</p>

<p>NAME smp_write_gpio - invoke WRITE GPIO REGISTER SMP
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_write_gpio [--count=CO] [--data=H,H...]
[--help] [--hex] [--index=IN] [--interface=PARAMS] [--raw]
[--sa=SAS_ADDR] [--type=TY] [--verbose] [--version]
SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP) WRITE
GPIO REGISTER request func- tion to a SMP target. The SMP
target is identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR.
Depending on the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from
the SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there is one SMP_DEVICE
per machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is needed to
differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.</p>

<p>This function is defined in SFF-8485 ( see
www.sffcommittee.com ) together with its corresponding READ
GPIO REGISTER SMP function. The other SMP functions are
defined in SAS documents at www.t10.org . SFF-8485 defines a
curious device called a &quot;virtual SMP port&quot; that
lives in a host bus adapter (HBA) and allows SMP to
manipulate the sideband signals in wide internal cables. To
stop other initiators in a multi-initiator domain from
accessing those sideband signals, the vir- tual SMP (target)
port is not indicated in a DISCOVER response.</p>

<p>-c, --count=CO where CO is the register count. This is
the number of (4 byte) registers to send. The default value
is 1.</p>

<p>-d, --data=H,H... this option supplies a comma separated
list of hexadecimal bytes (0 to ff inclusive) that will be
used as write data in the WRITE GPIO REGISTER request. The
number of bytes supplied should be four times --count=C The
first 4 bytes will become the first register written.</p>

<p>-d, --data=- reads string of hexadecimal bytes from
stdin. Spaces, tabs and line feeds additionally are
permitted as separators.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-i, --index=IN where IN is the register index. This
value is origin zero and its default value is 0. The request
will send --count=CO regis- ters starting from --index=IN of
the given --type=TY.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-t, --type=TY where TY is the register type. The default
value is 0 (GPIO_CFG). The request will send --count=CO
registers starting from --index=IN of the given
--type=TY.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP WRITE GPIO REGISTER function is
defined in SFF-8485 (see www.sffcommittee.com ) together
with its corresponding READ GPIO REGIS- TER SMP
function.</p>
