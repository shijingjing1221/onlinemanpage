<p>XtAddGrab(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtAddGrab(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtAddGrab, XtRemoveGrab - redirect user input to a
modal widget</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtAddGrab(Widget w, Boolean exclusive,
Boolean spring_loaded);</p>

<p>void XtRemoveGrab(Widget w);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS exclusive Specifies whether user events should
be dispatched exclu- sively to this widget or also to
previous widgets in the cas- cade.</p>

<p>spring_loaded Specifies whether this widget was popped
up because the user pressed a pointer button.</p>

<p>w Specifies the widget to add to or remove from the
modal cas- cade.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtAddGrab function appends the widget
(and associated parameters) to the modal cascade and checks
that exclusive is True if spring_loaded is True. If these
are not True, XtAddGrab generates an error.</p>

<p>The modal cascade is used by XtDispatchEvent when it
tries to dispatch a user event. When at least one modal
widget is in the widget cascade, XtDispatchEvent first
determines if the event should be delivered. It starts at
the most recent cascade entry and follows the cascade up to
and including the most recent cascade entry added with the
exclusive parameter True.</p>

<p>This subset of the modal cascade along with all
descendants of these widgets comprise the active subset.
User events that occur outside the widgets in this subset
are ignored or remapped. Modal menus with sub- menus
generally add a submenu widget to the cascade with exclusive
False. Modal dialog boxes that need to restrict user input
to the most deeply nested dialog box add a subdialog widget
to the cascade with exclusive True. User events that occur
within the active subset are delivered to the appropriate
widget, which is usually a child or fur- ther descendant of
the modal widget.</p>

<p>Regardless of where on the screen they occur, remap
events are always delivered to the most recent widget in the
active subset of the cascade that has spring_loaded True, if
any such widget exists.</p>

<p>The XtRemoveGrab function removes widgets from the modal
cascade start- ing at the most recent widget up to and
including the specified widget. It issues an error if the
specified widget is not on the modal cascade.</p>
