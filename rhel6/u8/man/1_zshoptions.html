<p>ZSHOPTIONS(1) ZSHOPTIONS(1)</p>

<p>NAME zshoptions - zsh options</p>

<p>SPECIFYING OPTIONS Options are primarily referred to by
name. These names are case insen- sitive and underscores are
ignored. For example, allexport is equiv- alent to
A__lleXP_ort.</p>

<p>The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding
it with no, so setopt No_Beep is equivalent to unsetopt
beep. This inversion can only be done once, so nonobeep is
not a synonym for beep. Sim- ilarly, tify is not a synonym
for nonotify (the inversion of notify).</p>

<p>Some options also have one or more single letter names.
There are two sets of single letter options: one used by
default, and another used to emulate sh/ksh (used when the
SH_OPTION_LETTERS option is set). The single letter options
can be used on the shell command line, or with the set,
setopt and unsetopt builtins, as normal Unix options
preceded by -.</p>

<p>The sense of the single letter options may be inverted
by using + instead of -. Some of the single letter option
names refer to an option being off, in which case the
inversion of that name refers to the option being on. For
example, +n is the short name of exec, and -n is the short
name of its inversion, noexec.</p>

<p>In strings of single letter options supplied to the
shell at startup, trailing whitespace will be ignored; for
example the string -f will be treated just as -f, but the
string -f i is an error. This is because many systems which
implement the #! mechanism for calling scripts do not strip
trailing whitespace.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS In the following list, options
set by default in all emulations are marked &lt;D&gt;; those
set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emula- tions are
marked &lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as
appropriate. When listing options (by setopt, unsetopt, set
-o or set +o ), those turned on by default appear in the
list prefixed with no. Hence (unless KSH_OPTION_PRINT is
set), setopt shows all options whose settings are changed
from the default.</p>

<p>Changing Directories AUTO_CD (-J) If a command is issued
that cant be executed as a normal com- mand, and the command
is the name of a directory, perform the cd command to that
directory.</p>

<p>AUTO_PUSHD (-N) Make cd push the old directory onto the
directory stack.</p>

<p>CDABLE_VARS (-T) If the argument to a cd command (or an
implied cd with the AUTO_CD option set) is not a directory,
and does not begin with a slash, try to expand the
expression as if it were preceded by a ~ (see the section
Filename Expansion).</p>

<p>CHASE_DOTS When changing to a directory containing a
path segment .. which would otherwise be treated as
canceling the previous segment in the path (in other words,
foo/.. would be removed from the path, or if .. is the first
part of the path, the last part of the current working
directory would be removed), instead resolve the path to the
physical directory. This option is overridden by
CHASE_LINKS.</p>

<p>For example, suppose /foo/bar is a link to the directory
/alt/rod. Without this option set, cd /foo/bar/.. changes to
/foo; with it set, it changes to /alt. The same applies if
the current directory is /foo/bar and cd .. is used. Note
that all other symbolic links in the path will also be
resolved.</p>

<p>CHASE_LINKS (-w) Resolve symbolic links to their true
values when changing direc- tory. This also has the effect
of CHASE_DOTS, i.e. a .. path segment will be treated as
referring to the physical parent, even if the preceding path
segment is a symbolic link.</p>

<p>POSIX_CD Modifies the behaviour of cd, chdir and pushd
commands to make them more compatible with the POSIX
standard. The behaviour with the option unset is described
in the documentation for the cd builtin in zshbuiltins(1).
If the option is set, the shell does not test for
directories beneath the local directory (.) until after all
directories in cdpath have been tested.</p>

<p>Also, if the option is set, the conditions under which
the shell prints the new directory after changing to it are
modified. It is no longer restricted to interactive shells
(although printing of the directory stack with pushd is
still limited to interac- tive shells); and any use of a
component of CDPATH, including a . but excluding an empty
component that is otherwise treated as ., causes the
directory to be printed.</p>

<p>PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS Don t push multiple copies of the same
directory onto the direc- tory stack.</p>

<p>PUSHD_MINUS Exchanges the meanings of + and - when used
with a number to specify a directory in the stack.</p>

<p>PUSHD_SILENT (-E) Do not print the directory stack after
pushd or popd.</p>

<p>PUSHD_TO_HOME (-D) Have pushd with no arguments act like
pushd $HOME .</p>

<p>Completion ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT &lt;D&gt; If unset, key
functions that list completions try to return to the last
prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these func- tions
try to return to the last prompt if given no numeric argu-
ment.</p>

<p>ALWAYS_TO_END If a completion is performed with the
cursor within a word, and a full completion is inserted, the
cursor is moved to the end of the word. That is, the cursor
is moved to the end of the word if either a single match is
inserted or menu completion is per- formed.</p>

<p>AUTO_LIST (-9) &lt;D&gt; Automatically list choices on
an ambiguous completion.</p>

<p>AUTO_MENU &lt;D&gt; Automatically use menu completion
after the second consecutive request for completion, for
example by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option is
overridden by MENU_COMPLETE.</p>

<p>AUTO_NAME_DIRS Any parameter that is set to the absolute
name of a directory immediately becomes a name for that
directory, that will be used by the %~ and related prompt
sequences, and will be available when completion is
performed on a word starting with ~. (Oth- erwise, the
parameter must be used in the form ~param first.)</p>

<p>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS &lt;D&gt; If a parameter name was
completed and a following character (normally a space)
automatically inserted, and the next charac- ter typed is
one of those that have to come directly after the name (like
}, :, etc.), the automatically added character is deleted,
so that the character typed comes immediately after the
parameter name. Completion in a brace expansion is affected
similarly: the added character is a ,, which will be removed
if } is typed next.</p>

<p>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH &lt;D&gt; If a parameter is completed
whose content is the name of a directory, then add a
trailing slash instead of a space.</p>

<p>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH &lt;D&gt; When the last character
resulting from a completion is a slash and the next
character typed is a word delimiter, a slash, or a character
that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an amper- sand),
remove the slash.</p>

<p>BASH_AUTO_LIST On an ambiguous completion, automatically
list choices when the completion function is called twice in
succession. This takes precedence over AUTO_LIST. The
setting of LIST_AMBIGUOUS is respected. If AUTO_MENU is set,
the menu behaviour will then start with the third press.
Note that this will not work with MENU_COMPLETE, since
repeated completion calls immediately cycle through the list
in that case.</p>

<p>COMPLETE_ALIASES Prevents aliases on the command line
from being internally sub- stituted before completion is
attempted. The effect is to make the alias a distinct
command for completion purposes.</p>

<p>COMPLETE_IN_WORD If unset, the cursor is set to the end
of the word if completion is started. Otherwise it stays
there and completion is done from both ends.</p>

<p>GLOB_COMPLETE When the current word has a glob pattern,
do not insert all the words resulting from the expansion but
generate matches as for completion and cycle through them
like MENU_COMPLETE. The matches are generated as if a * was
added to the end of the word, or inserted at the cursor when
COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set. This actually uses pattern
matching, not globbing, so it works not only for files but
for any completion, such as options, user names, etc.</p>

<p>Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching
control (for example, case-insensitive or anchored matching)
cannot be used. This limitation only applies when the
current word con- tains a pattern; simply turning on the
GLOB_COMPLETE option does not have this effect.</p>

<p>HASH_LIST_ALL &lt;D&gt; Whenever a command completion is
attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed
first. This makes the first completion slower.</p>

<p>LIST_AMBIGUOUS &lt;D&gt; This option works when
AUTO_LIST or BASH_AUTO_LIST is also set. If there is an
unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line, that is
done without a completion list being displayed; in other
words, auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing
would be inserted. In the case of BASH_AUTO_LIST, this means
that the list will be delayed to the third call of the
function.</p>

<p>LIST_BEEP &lt;D&gt; Beep on an ambiguous completion.
More accurately, this forces the completion widgets to
return status 1 on an ambiguous com- pletion, which causes
the shell to beep if the option BEEP is also set; this may
be modified if completion is called from a user-defined
widget.</p>

<p>LIST_PACKED Try to make the completion list smaller
(occupying less lines) by printing the matches in columns
with different widths.</p>

<p>LIST_ROWS_FIRST Lay out the matches in completion lists
sorted horizontally, that is, the second match is to the
right of the first one, not under it as usual.</p>

<p>LIST_TYPES (-X) &lt;D&gt; When listing files that are
possible completions, show the type of each file with a
trailing identifying mark.</p>

<p>MENU_COMPLETE (-Y) On an ambiguous completion, instead
of listing possibilities or beeping, insert the first match
immediately. Then when comple- tion is requested again,
remove the first match and insert the second match, etc.
When there are no more matches, go back to the first one
again. reverse-menu-complete may be used to loop through the
list in the other direction. This option overrides
AUTO_MENU.</p>

<p>REC_EXACT (-S) In completion, recognize exact matches
even if they are ambigu- ous.</p>

<p>Expansion and Globbing BAD_PATTERN (+2) &lt;C&gt;
&lt;Z&gt; If a pattern for filename generation is badly
formed, print an error message. (If this option is unset,
the pattern will be left unchanged.)</p>

<p>BARE_GLOB_QUAL &lt;Z&gt; In a glob pattern, treat a
trailing set of parentheses as a qualifier list, if it
contains no |, ( or (if special) ~ characters. See the
section Filename Generation.</p>

<p>BRACE_CCL Expand expressions in braces which would not
otherwise undergo brace expansion to a lexically ordered
list of all the charac- ters. See the section Brace
Expansion.</p>

<p>CASE_GLOB &lt;D&gt; Make globbing (filename generation)
sensitive to case. Note that other uses of patterns are
always sensitive to case. If the option is unset, the
presence of any character which is spe- cial to filename
generation will cause case-insensitive match- ing. For
example, cvs(/) can match the directory CVS owing to the
presence of the globbing flag (unless the option
BARE_GLOB_QUAL is unset).</p>

<p>CASE_MATCH &lt;D&gt; Make regular expressions using the
zsh/regex module (including matches with =~) sensitive to
case.</p>

<p>CSH_NULL_GLOB &lt;C&gt; If a pattern for filename
generation has no matches, delete the pattern from the
argument list; do not report an error unless all the
patterns in a command have no matches. Overrides
NOMATCH.</p>

<p>EQUALS &lt;Z&gt; Perform = filename expansion. (See the
section Filename Expan- sion.)</p>

<p>EXTENDED_GLOB Treat the #, ~ and ^ characters as part of
patterns for filename generation, etc. (An initial unquoted
~ always pro- duces named directory expansion.)</p>

<p>GLOB (+F, ksh: +f) &lt;D&gt; Perform filename generation
(globbing). (See the section File- name Generation.)</p>

<p>GLOB_ASSIGN &lt;C&gt; If this option is set, filename
generation (globbing) is per- formed on the right hand side
of scalar parameter assignments of the form name=pattern
(e.g. foo=*). If the result has more than one word the
parameter will become an array with those words as
arguments. This option is provided for backwards com-
patibility only: globbing is always performed on the right
hand side of array assignments of the form name=(value)
(e.g. foo=(*) ) and this form is recommended for clarity;
with this option set, it is not possible to predict whether
the result will be an array or a scalar.</p>

<p>GLOB_DOTS (-4) Do not require a leading . in a filename
to be matched explic- itly.</p>

<p>GLOB_SUBST &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Treat any
characters resulting from parameter expansion as being
eligible for file expansion and filename generation, and any
characters resulting from command substitution as being
eligible for filename generation. Braces (and commas in
between) do not become eligible for expansion.</p>

<p>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN Substitutions using the :s and :&amp;
history modifiers are per- formed with pattern matching
instead of string matching. This occurs wherever history
modifiers are valid, including glob qualifiers and
parameters. See the section Modifiers in zsh- expn(1).</p>

<p>IGNORE_BRACES (-I) &lt;S&gt; Do not perform brace
expansion.</p>

<p>KSH_GLOB &lt;K&gt; In pattern matching, the
interpretation of parentheses is affected by a preceding @,
*, +, ? or !. See the sec- tion Filename Generation.</p>

<p>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST All unquoted arguments of the form
anything=expression appear- ing after the command name have
filename expansion (that is, where expression has a leading
~ or =) performed on expres- sion as if it were a parameter
assignment. The argument is not otherwise treated specially;
it is passed to the command as a single argument, and not
used as an actual parameter assignment. For example, in echo
foo=~/bar:~/rod, both occurrences of ~ would be replaced.
Note that this happens anyway with typeset and similar
statements.</p>

<p>This option respects the setting of the KSH_TYPESET
option. In other words, if both options are in effect,
arguments looking like assignments will not undergo word
splitting.</p>

<p>MARK_DIRS (-8, ksh: -X) Append a trailing / to all
directory names resulting from filename generation
(globbing).</p>

<p>MULTIBYTE &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Respect
multibyte characters when found in strings. When this option
is set, strings are examined using the system library to
determine how many bytes form a character, depending on the
cur- rent locale. This affects the way characters are
counted in pattern matching, parameter values and various
delimiters.</p>

<p>The option is on by default if the shell was compiled
with MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT except in sh emulation; otherwise it
is off by default and has no effect if turned on. The mode
is off in sh emulation for compatibility but for interactive
use may need to be turned on if the terminal interprets
multibyte characters.</p>

<p>If the option is off a single byte is always treated as
a single character. This setting is designed purely for
examining strings known to contain raw bytes or other values
that may not be characters in the current locale. It is not
necessary to unset the option merely because the character
set for the cur- rent locale does not contain multibyte
characters.</p>

<p>The option does not affect the shell s editor, which
always uses the locale to determine multibyte characters.
This is because the character set displayed by the terminal
emulator is independent of shell settings.</p>

<p>NOMATCH (+3) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; If a pattern for
filename generation has no matches, print an error, instead
of leaving it unchanged in the argument list. This also
applies to file expansion of an initial ~ or =.</p>

<p>NULL_GLOB (-G) If a pattern for filename generation has
no matches, delete the pattern from the argument list
instead of reporting an error. Overrides NOMATCH.</p>

<p>NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT If numeric filenames are matched by a
filename generation pat- tern, sort the filenames
numerically rather than lexicographi- cally.</p>

<p>RC_EXPAND_PARAM (-P) Array expansions of the form
foo${xx}bar , where the parameter xx is set to (a b c), are
substituted with fooabar foobbar foocbar instead of the
default fooa b cbar . Note that an empty array will
therefore cause all arguments to be removed.</p>

<p>REMATCH_PCRE &lt;Z&gt; If set, regular expression
matching with the =~ operator will use Perl-Compatible
Regular Expressions from the PCRE library, if available. If
not set, regular expressions will use the extended regexp
syntax provided by the system libraries.</p>

<p>SH_GLOB &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Disables the special meaning
of (, |, ) and &lt; for glob- bing the result of parameter
and command substitutions, and in some other places where
the shell accepts patterns. This option is set by default if
zsh is invoked as sh or ksh.</p>

<p>UNSET (+u, ksh: +u) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Treat
unset parameters as if they were empty when substituting.
Otherwise they are treated as an error.</p>

<p>WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL Print a warning message when a global
parameter is created in a function by an assignment. This
often indicates that a parame- ter has not been declared
local when it should have been. Parameters explicitly
declared global from within a function using typeset -g do
not cause a warning. Note that there is no warning when a
local parameter is assigned to in a nested func- tion, which
may also indicate an error.</p>

<p>History APPEND_HISTORY &lt;D&gt; If this is set, zsh
sessions will append their history list to the history file,
rather than replace it. Thus, multiple paral- lel zsh
sessions will all have the new entries from their his- tory
lists added to the history file, in the order that they
exit. The file will still be periodically re-written to trim
it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value
specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY
option).</p>

<p>BANG_HIST (+K) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Perform textual
history expansion, csh-style, treating the char- acter !
specially.</p>

<p>EXTENDED_HISTORY &lt;C&gt; Save each commands beginning
timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) and the duration (in
seconds) to the history file. The format of this prefixed
data is:</p>

<p>: &lt;beginning time&gt;:&lt;elapsed
seconds&gt;;&lt;command&gt;.</p>

<p>HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER Add | to output redirections in the
history. This allows his- tory references to clobber files
even when CLOBBER is unset.</p>

<p>HIST_BEEP &lt;D&gt; Beep when an attempt is made to
access a history entry which isnt there.</p>

<p>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST If the internal history needs to
be trimmed to add the current command line, setting this
option will cause the oldest history event that has a
duplicate to be lost before losing a unique event from the
list. You should be sure to set the value of HISTSIZE to a
larger number than SAVEHIST in order to give you some room
for the duplicated events, otherwise this option will behave
just like HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS once the history fills up
with unique events.</p>

<p>HIST_FCNTL_LOCK When writing out the history file, by
default zsh uses ad-hoc file locking to avoid known problems
with locking on some oper- ating systems. With this option
locking is done by means of the systems fcntl call, where
this method is available. On recent operating systems this
may provide better performance, in particular avoiding
history corruption when files are stored on NFS.</p>

<p>HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS When searching for history entries in
the line editor, do not display duplicates of a line
previously found, even if the duplicates are not
contiguous.</p>

<p>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS If a new command line being added
to the history list duplicates an older one, the older
command is removed from the list (even if it is not the
previous event).</p>

<p>HIST_IGNORE_DUPS (-h) Do not enter command lines into
the history list if they are duplicates of the previous
event.</p>

<p>HIST_IGNORE_SPACE (-g) Remove command lines from the
history list when the first char- acter on the line is a
space, or when one of the expanded aliases contains a
leading space. Only normal aliases (not global or suffix
aliases) have this behaviour. Note that the command lingers
in the internal history until the next command is entered
before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit
the line. If you want to make it vanish right away without
entering another command, type a space and press return.</p>

<p>HIST_LEX_WORDS By default, shell history that is read in
from files is split into words on all white space. This
means that arguments with quoted whitespace are not
correctly handled, with the conse- quence that references to
words in history lines that have been read from a file may
be inaccurate. When this option is set, words read in from a
history file are divided up in a similar fashion to normal
shell command line handling. Although this produces more
accurately delimited words, if the size of the history file
is large this can be slow. Trial and error is nec- essary to
decide.</p>

<p>HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS Remove function definitions from the
history list. Note that the function lingers in the internal
history until the next com- mand is entered before it
vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit the
definition.</p>

<p>HIST_NO_STORE Remove the history (fc -l) command from
the history list when invoked. Note that the command lingers
in the internal history until the next command is entered
before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or edit
the line.</p>

<p>HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS Remove superfluous blanks from each
command line being added to the history list.</p>

<p>HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY &lt;D&gt; When the history file is
re-written, we normally write out a copy of the file named
$HISTFILE.new and then rename it over the old one. However,
if this option is unset, we instead truncate the old history
file and write out the new version in-place. If one of the
history-appending options is enabled, this option only has
an effect when the enlarged history file needs to be
re-written to trim it down to size. Disable this only if you
have special needs, as doing so makes it possible to lose
his- tory entries if zsh gets interrupted during the
save.</p>

<p>When writing out a copy of the history file, zsh
preserves the old file s permissions and group information,
but will refuse to write out a new file if it would change
the history files owner.</p>

<p>HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS When writing out the history file,
older commands that duplicate newer ones are omitted.</p>

<p>HIST_VERIFY Whenever the user enters a line with history
expansion, dont execute the line directly; instead, perform
history expansion and reload the line into the editing
buffer.</p>

<p>INC_APPEND_HISTORY This options works like
APPEND_HISTORY except that new history lines are added to
the $HISTFILE incrementally (as soon as they are entered),
rather than waiting until the shell exits. The file will
still be periodically re-written to trim it when the number
of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by $SAVE- HIST
(see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).</p>

<p>SHARE_HISTORY &lt;K&gt;</p>

<p>This option both imports new commands from the history
file, and also causes your typed commands to be appended to
the history file (the latter is like specifying
INC_APPEND_HISTORY). The history lines are also output with
timestamps ala EXTENDED_HIS- TORY (which makes it easier to
find the spot where we left off reading the file after it
gets re-written).</p>

<p>By default, history movement commands visit the imported
lines as well as the local lines, but you can toggle this on
and off with the set-local-history zle binding. It is also
possible to create a zle widget that will make some commands
ignore imported commands, and some include them.</p>

<p>If you find that you want more control over when
commands get imported, you may wish to turn SHARE_HISTORY
off, INC_APPEND_HISTORY on, and then manually import
commands when- ever you need them using fc -RI.</p>

<p>Initialisation ALL_EXPORT (-a, ksh: -a) All parameters
subsequently defined are automatically exported.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_EXPORT (&lt;Z&gt;) If this option is set, passing
the -x flag to the builtins declare, float, integer,
readonly and typeset (but not local) will also set the -g
flag; hence parameters exported to the environment will not
be made local to the enclosing function, unless they were
already or the flag +g is given explicitly. If the option is
unset, exported parameters will be made local in just the
same way as any other parameter.</p>

<p>This option is set by default for backward
compatibility; it is not recommended that its behaviour be
relied upon. Note that the builtin export always sets both
the -x and -g flags, and hence its effect extends beyond the
scope of the enclosing func- tion; this is the most portable
way to achieve this behaviour.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_RCS (-d) &lt;D&gt; If this option is unset, the
startup files /etc/zprofile, /etc/zshrc, /etc/zlogin and
/etc/zlogout will not be run. It can be disabled and
re-enabled at any time, including inside local startup files
(.zshrc, etc.).</p>

<p>RCS (+f) &lt;D&gt; After /etc/zshenv is sourced on
startup, source the .zshenv, /etc/zprofile, .zprofile,
/etc/zshrc, .zshrc, /etc/zlogin, .zlogin, and .zlogout
files, as described in the section Files . If this option is
unset, the /etc/zshenv file is still sourced, but any of the
others will not be; it can be set at any time to prevent the
remaining startup files after the currently executing one
from being sourced.</p>

<p>Input/Output ALIASES &lt;D&gt; Expand aliases.</p>

<p>CLOBBER (+C, ksh: +C) &lt;D&gt; Allows &gt; redirection
to truncate existing files, and &gt;&gt; to create files.
Otherwise &gt;! or &gt;| must be used to truncate a file,
and &gt;&gt;! or &gt;&gt;| to create a file.</p>

<p>CORRECT (-0) Try to correct the spelling of commands.
Note that, when the HASH_LIST_ALL option is not set or when
some directories in the path are not readable, this may
falsely report spelling errors the first time some commands
are used.</p>

<p>The shell variable CORRECT_IGNORE may be set to a
pattern to match words that will never be offered as
corrections.</p>

<p>CORRECT_ALL (-O) Try to correct the spelling of all
arguments in a line.</p>

<p>DVORAK Use the Dvorak keyboard instead of the standard
qwerty keyboard as a basis for examining spelling mistakes
for the CORRECT and CORRECT_ALL options and the spell-word
editor command.</p>

<p>FLOW_CONTROL &lt;D&gt; If this option is unset, output
flow control via start/stop characters (usually assigned to
^S/^Q) is disabled in the shells editor.</p>

<p>IGNORE_EOF (-7) Do not exit on end-of-file. Require the
use of exit or logout instead. However, ten consecutive EOFs
will cause the shell to exit anyway, to avoid the shell
hanging if its tty goes away.</p>

<p>Also, if this option is set and the Zsh Line Editor is
used, widgets implemented by shell functions can be bound to
EOF (nor- mally Control-D) without printing the normal
warning message. This works only for normal widgets, not for
completion widgets.</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Allow
comments even in interactive shells.</p>

<p>HASH_CMDS &lt;D&gt; Note the location of each command
the first time it is executed. Subsequent invocations of the
same command will use the saved location, avoiding a path
search. If this option is unset, no path hashing is done at
all. However, when CORRECT is set, com- mands whose names do
not appear in the functions or aliases hash tables are
hashed in order to avoid reporting them as spelling
errors.</p>

<p>HASH_DIRS &lt;D&gt; Whenever a command name is hashed,
hash the directory containing it, as well as all directories
that occur earlier in the path. Has no effect if neither
HASH_CMDS nor CORRECT is set.</p>

<p>MAIL_WARNING (-U) Print a warning message if a mail file
has been accessed since the shell last checked.</p>

<p>PATH_DIRS (-Q) Perform a path search even on command
names with slashes in them. Thus if /usr/local/bin is in the
users path, and he or she types X11/xinit , the command
/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit will be executed (assuming it
exists). Commands explicitly beginning with /, ./ or ../ are
not subject to the path search. This also applies to the .
builtin.</p>

<p>Note that subdirectories of the current directory are
always searched for executables specified in this form. This
takes place before any search indicated by this option, and
regardless of whether . or the current directory appear in
the command search path.</p>

<p>PATH_SCRIPT &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; If this option is not
set, a script passed as the first non-option argument to the
shell must contain the name of the file to open. If this
option is set, and the script does not specify a directory
path, the script is looked for first in the current
directory, then in the command path. See the section
INVOCATION in zsh(1).</p>

<p>PRINT_EIGHT_BIT Print eight bit characters literally in
completion lists, etc. This option is not necessary if your
system correctly returns the printability of eight bit
characters (see ctype(3)).</p>

<p>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE (-1) Print the exit value of programs
with non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>RC_QUOTES Allow the character sequence to signify a
single quote within singly quoted strings. Note this does
not apply in quoted strings using the format $ ... , where a
backslashed sin- gle quote can be used.</p>

<p>RM_STAR_SILENT (-H) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Do not query the
user before executing rm * or rm path/*.</p>

<p>RM_STAR_WAIT If querying the user before executing rm *
or rm path/*, first wait ten seconds and ignore anything
typed in that time. This avoids the problem of reflexively
answering yes to the query when one didnt really mean it.
The wait and query can always be avoided by expanding the *
in ZLE (with tab).</p>

<p>SHORT_LOOPS &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Allow the short forms of
for, repeat, select, if, and function constructs.</p>

<p>SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK (-L) If a line ends with a backquote,
and there are an odd number of backquotes on the line,
ignore the trailing backquote. This is useful on some
keyboards where the return key is too small, and the
backquote key lies annoyingly close to it. As an alterna-
tive the variable KEYBOARD_HACK lets you choose the
character to be removed.</p>

<p>Job Control AUTO_CONTINUE With this option set, stopped
jobs that are removed from the job table with the disown
builtin command are automatically sent a CONT signal to make
them running.</p>

<p>AUTO_RESUME (-W) Treat single word simple commands
without redirection as candi- dates for resumption of an
existing job.</p>

<p>BG_NICE (-6) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; Run all background jobs
at a lower priority. This option is set by default.</p>

<p>CHECK_JOBS &lt;Z&gt; Report the status of background and
suspended jobs before exit- ing a shell with job control; a
second attempt to exit the shell will succeed. NO_CHECK_JOBS
is best used only in combination with NO_HUP, else such jobs
will be killed automatically.</p>

<p>The check is omitted if the commands run from the
previous com- mand line included a jobs command, since it is
assumed the user is aware that there are background or
suspended jobs. A jobs command run from one of the hook
functions defined in the section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS in
zshmisc(1) is not counted for this purpose.</p>

<p>HUP &lt;Z&gt; Send the HUP signal to running jobs when
the shell exits.</p>

<p>LONG_LIST_JOBS (-R) List jobs in the long format by
default.</p>

<p>MONITOR (-m, ksh: -m) Allow job control. Set by default
in interactive shells.</p>

<p>NOTIFY (-5, ksh: -b) &lt;Z&gt; Report the status of
background jobs immediately, rather than waiting until just
before printing a prompt.</p>

<p>POSIX_JOBS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; This option makes job
control more compliant with the POSIX standard.</p>

<p>When the option is not set, the MONITOR option is unset
on entry to subshells, so that job control is no longer
active. When the option is set, the MONITOR option and job
control remain active in the subshell, but note that the
subshell has no access to jobs in the parent shell.</p>

<p>When the option is not set, jobs put in the background
or fore- ground with bg or fg are displayed with the same
information that would be reported by jobs. When the option
is set, only the text is printed. The output from jobs
itself is not affected by the option.</p>

<p>When the option is not set, job information from the
parent shell is saved for output within a subshell (for
example, within a pipeline). When the option is set, the
output of jobs is empty until a job is started within the
subshell.</p>

<p>When the option is set, it becomes possible to use the
wait builtin to wait for the last job started in the
background (as given by $!) even if that job has already
exited. This works even if the option is turned on
temporarily around the use of the wait builtin.</p>

<p>Prompting PROMPT_BANG &lt;K&gt; If set, ! is treated
specially in prompt expansion. See EXPANSION OF PROMPT
SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>PROMPT_CR (+V) &lt;D&gt; Print a carriage return just
before printing a prompt in the line editor. This is on by
default as multi-line editing is only possible if the editor
knows where the start of the line appears.</p>

<p>PROMPT_SP &lt;D&gt; Attempt to preserve a partial line
(i.e. a line that did not end with a newline) that would
otherwise be covered up by the com- mand prompt due to the
PROMPT_CR option. This works by out- putting some
cursor-control characters, including a series of spaces,
that should make the terminal wrap to the next line when a
partial line is present (note that this is only successful
if your terminal has automatic margins, which is
typical).</p>

<p>When a partial line is preserved, by default you will
see an inverse+bold character at the end of the partial
line: a &quot;%&quot; for a normal user or a &quot;#&quot;
for root. If set, the shell parame- ter PROMPT_EOL_MARK can
be used to customize how the end of par- tial lines are
shown.</p>

<p>NOTE: if the PROMPT_CR option is not set, enabling this
option will have no effect. This option is on by
default.</p>

<p>PROMPT_PERCENT &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; If set, % is treated
specially in prompt expansion. See EXPANSION OF PROMPT
SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>PROMPT_SUBST &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; If set, parameter
expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion are
performed in prompts. Substitutions within prompts do not
affect the command status.</p>

<p>TRANSIENT_RPROMPT Remove any right prompt from display
when accepting a command line. This may be useful with
terminals with other cut/paste methods.</p>

<p>Scripts and Functions C_BASES Output hexadecimal numbers
in the standard C format, for example 0xFF instead of the
usual 16#FF . If the option OCTAL_ZEROES is also set (it is
not by default), octal numbers will be treated similarly and
hence appear as 077 instead of 8#77. This option has no
effect on the choice of the output base, nor on the output
of bases other than hexadecimal and octal. Note that these
formats will be understood on input irrespective of the
setting of C_BASES.</p>

<p>C_PRECEDENCES This alters the precedence of arithmetic
operators to be more like C and other programming languages;
the section ARITHMETIC EVALUATION in zshmisc(1) has an
explicit list.</p>

<p>DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD Run the DEBUG trap before each command;
otherwise it is run after each command. Setting this option
mimics the behaviour of ksh 93; with the option unset the
behaviour is that of ksh 88.</p>

<p>ERR_EXIT (-e, ksh: -e) If a command has a non-zero exit
status, execute the ZERR trap, if set, and exit. This is
disabled while running initialization scripts.</p>

<p>The behaviour is also disabled inside DEBUG traps. In
this case the option is handled specially: it is unset on
entry to the trap. If the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set, as
it is by default, and the option ERR_EXIT is found to have
been set on exit, then the command for which the DEBUG trap
is being exe- cuted is skipped. The option is restored after
the trap exits.</p>

<p>ERR_RETURN If a command has a non-zero exit status,
return immediately from the enclosing function. The logic is
identical to that for ERR_EXIT, except that an implicit
return statement is executed instead of an exit. This will
trigger an exit at the outermost level of a non-interactive
script.</p>

<p>EVAL_LINENO &lt;Z&gt; If set, line numbers of
expressions evaluated using the builtin eval are tracked
separately of the enclosing environment. This applies both
to the parameter LINENO and the line number output by the
prompt escape %i. If the option is set, the prompt escape %N
will output the string (eval) instead of the script or
function name as an indication. (The two prompt escapes are
typically used in the parameter PS4 to be output when the
option XTRACE is set.) If EVAL_LINENO is unset, the line
number of the surrounding script or function is retained
during the evalua- tion.</p>

<p>EXEC (+n, ksh: +n) &lt;D&gt; Do execute commands.
Without this option, commands are read and checked for
syntax errors, but not executed. This option cannot be
turned off in an interactive shell, except when -n is sup-
plied to the shell at startup.</p>

<p>FUNCTION_ARGZERO &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; When executing a
shell function or sourcing a script, set $0 temporarily to
the name of the function/script.</p>

<p>LOCAL_OPTIONS &lt;K&gt; If this option is set at the
point of return from a shell func- tion, most options
(including this one) which were in force upon entry to the
function are restored; options that are not restored are
PRIVILEGED and RESTRICTED. Otherwise, only this option and
the XTRACE and PRINT_EXIT_VALUE options are restored. Hence
if this is explicitly unset by a shell function the other
options in force at the point of return will remain so. A
shell function can also guarantee itself a known shell
configuration with a formulation like emulate -L zsh ; the
-L activates LOCAL_OPTIONS.</p>

<p>LOCAL_TRAPS &lt;K&gt; If this option is set when a
signal trap is set inside a func- tion, then the previous
status of the trap for that signal will be restored when the
function exits. Note that this option must be set prior to
altering the trap behaviour in a function; unlike
LOCAL_OPTIONS, the value on exit from the function is
irrelevant. However, it does not need to be set before any
global trap for that to be correctly restored by a function.
For example,</p>

<p>unsetopt localtraps trap - INT fn() { setopt localtraps;
trapINT; sleep 3; }</p>

<p>will restore normal handling of SIGINT after the
function exits.</p>

<p>MULTI_FUNC_DEF &lt;Z&gt; Allow definitions of multiple
functions at once in the form fn1 fn2...() ; if the option
is not set, this causes a parse error. Definition of
multiple functions with the function keyword is always
allowed. Multiple function definitions are not often used
and can cause obscure errors.</p>

<p>MULTIOS &lt;Z&gt; Perform implicit tees or cats when
multiple redirections are attempted (see the section
Redirection).</p>

<p>OCTAL_ZEROES &lt;S&gt; Interpret any integer constant
beginning with a 0 as octal, per IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (ISO
9945-2:1993). This is not enabled by default as it causes
problems with parsing of, for example, date and time strings
with leading zeroes.</p>

<p>Sequences of digits indicating a numeric base such as
the 08 component in 08#77 are always interpreted as decimal,
regard- less of leading zeroes.</p>

<p>SOURCE_TRACE If set, zsh will print an informational
message announcing the name of each file it loads. The
format of the output is similar to that for the XTRACE
option, with the message &lt;sourcetrace&gt;. A file may be
loaded by the shell itself when it starts up and shuts down
(Startup/Shutdown Files) or by the use of the source and dot
builtin commands.</p>

<p>TYPESET_SILENT If this is unset, executing any of the
typeset family of com- mands with no options and a list of
parameters that have no val- ues to be assigned but already
exist will display the value of the parameter. If the option
is set, they will only be shown when parameters are selected
with the -m option. The option -p is available whether or
not the option is set.</p>

<p>VERBOSE (-v, ksh: -v) Print shell input lines as they
are read.</p>

<p>XTRACE (-x, ksh: -x) Print commands and their arguments
as they are executed. The output is proceded by the value of
$PS4, formatted as described in the section EXPANSION OF
PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>Shell Emulation BASH_REMATCH When set, matches performed
with the =~ operator will set the BASH_REMATCH array
variable, instead of the default MATCH and match variables.
The first element of the BASH_REMATCH array will contain the
entire matched text and subsequent elements will contain
extracted substrings. This option makes more sense when
KSH_ARRAYS is also set, so that the entire matched portion
is stored at index 0 and the first substring is at index 1.
Without this option, the MATCH variable contains the entire
matched text and the match array variable contains
substrings.</p>

<p>BSD_ECHO &lt;S&gt; Make the echo builtin compatible with
the BSD echo(1) command. This disables backslashed escape
sequences in echo strings unless the -e option is
specified.</p>

<p>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY &lt;C&gt; A history reference without
an event specifier will always refer to the previous
command. Without this option, such a history reference
refers to the same event as the previous history ref-
erence, defaulting to the previous command.</p>

<p>CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS &lt;C&gt; Allow loop bodies to take the
form list; end instead of do list; done.</p>

<p>CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES &lt;C&gt; Changes the rules for
single- and double-quoted text to match that of csh. These
require that embedded newlines be preceded by a backslash;
unescaped newlines will cause an error message. In
double-quoted strings, it is made impossible to escape $, or
&quot; (and itself no longer needs escaping). Command
substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be
nested.</p>

<p>CSH_NULLCMD &lt;C&gt; Do not use the values of NULLCMD
and READNULLCMD when running redirections with no command.
This make such redirections fail (see the section
Redirection).</p>

<p>KSH_ARRAYS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Emulate ksh array
handling as closely as possible. If this option is set,
array elements are numbered from zero, an array parameter
without subscript refers to the first element instead of the
whole array, and braces are required to delimit a sub-
script (${path[2]} rather than just $path[2]).</p>

<p>KSH_AUTOLOAD &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Emulate ksh function
autoloading. This means that when a func- tion is
autoloaded, the corresponding file is merely executed, and
must define the function itself. (By default, the function
is defined to the contents of the file. However, the most
com- mon ksh-style case - of the file containing only a
simple defi- nition of the function - is always handled in
the ksh-compatible manner.)</p>

<p>KSH_OPTION_PRINT &lt;K&gt; Alters the way options
settings are printed: instead of separate lists of set and
unset options, all options are shown, marked on if they are
in the non-default state, off otherwise.</p>

<p>KSH_TYPESET &lt;K&gt; Alters the way arguments to the
typeset family of commands, including declare, export,
float, integer, local and readonly, are processed. Without
this option, zsh will perform normal word splitting after
command and parameter expansion in argu- ments of an
assignment; with it, word splitting does not take place in
those cases.</p>

<p>KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT Treat use of a subscript of value
zero in array or string expressions as a reference to the
first element, i.e. the ele- ment that usually has the
subscript 1. Ignored if KSH_ARRAYS is also set.</p>

<p>If neither this option nor KSH_ARRAYS is set, accesses
to an element of an array or string with subscript zero
return an empty element or string, while attempts to set
element zero of an array or string are treated as an error.
However, attempts to set an otherwise valid subscript range
that includes zero will succeed. For example, if
KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT is not set,</p>

<p>array[0]=(element)</p>

<p>is an error, while</p>

<p>array[0,1]=(element)</p>

<p>is not and will replace the first element of the
array.</p>

<p>This option is for compatibility with older versions of
the shell and is not recommended in new code.</p>

<p>POSIX_ALIASES &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; When this option is
set, reserved words are not candidates for alias expansion:
it is still possible to declare any of them as an alias, but
the alias will never be expanded. Reserved words are
described in the section RESERVED WORDS in zshmisc(1).</p>

<p>Alias expansion takes place while text is being read;
hence when this option is set it does not take effect until
the end of any function or other piece of shell code parsed
as one unit. Note this may cause differences from other
shells even when the option is in effect. For example, when
running a command with zsh -c, or even zsh -o posixaliases
-c , the entire command argument is parsed as one unit, so
aliases defined within the argument are not available even
in later lines. If in doubt, avoid use of aliases in
non-interactive code.</p>

<p>POSIX_BUILTINS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; When this option is
set the command builtin can be used to exe- cute shell
builtin commands. Parameter assignments specified before
shell functions and special builtins are kept after the
command completes unless the special builtin is prefixed
with the command builtin. Special builtins are ., :, break,
con- tinue, declare, eval, exit, export, integer, local,
readonly, return, set, shift, source, times, trap and
unset.</p>

<p>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; When this option
is set, only the ASCII characters a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9 and
_ may be used in identifiers (names of shell parameters and
modules).</p>

<p>When the option is unset and multibyte character support
is enabled (i.e. it is compiled in and the option MULTIBYTE
is set), then additionally any alphanumeric characters in
the local character set may be used in identifiers. Note
that scripts and functions written with this feature are not
portable, and also that both options must be set before the
script or function is parsed; setting them during execution
is not sufficient as the syntax variable=value has already
been parsed as a command rather than an assignment.</p>

<p>If multibyte character support is not compiled into the
shell this option is ignored; all octets with the top bit
set may be used in identifiers. This is non-standard but is
the tradi- tional zsh behaviour.</p>

<p>POSIX_STRINGS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; This option affects
processing of quoted strings. Currently it only affects the
behaviour of null characters, i.e. character 0 in the
portable character set corresponding to US ASCII.</p>

<p>When this option is not set, null characters embedded
within strings of the form ...are treated as ordinary
characters. The entire string is maintained within the shell
and output to files where necessary, although owing to
restrictions of the library interface the string is
truncated at the null character in file names, environment
variables, or in arguments to exter- nal programs.</p>

<p>When this option is set, the $... expression is
truncated at the null character. Note that remaining parts
of the same string beyond the termination of the quotes are
not trunctated.</p>

<p>For example, the command line argument a0d is treated
with the option off as the characters a, b, null, c, d, and
with the option on as the characters a, b, d.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRAPS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; When the is option is
set, the usual zsh behaviour of executing traps for EXIT on
exit from shell functions is suppressed. In that case,
manipulating EXIT traps always alters the global trap for
exiting the shell; the LOCAL_TRAPS option is ignored for the
EXIT trap.</p>

<p>SH_FILE_EXPANSION &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Perform filename
expansion (e.g., ~ expansion) before parameter expansion,
command substitution, arithmetic expansion and brace
expansion. If this option is unset, it is performed after
brace expansion, so things like ~$USERNAME and
~{pfalstad,rc} will work.</p>

<p>SH_NULLCMD &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Do not use the values of
NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when doing redirections, use :
instead (see the section Redirection).</p>

<p>SH_OPTION_LETTERS &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; If this option is
set the shell tries to interpret single letter options
(which are used with set and setopt) like ksh does. This
also affects the value of the - special parameter.</p>

<p>SH_WORD_SPLIT (-y) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; Causes field
splitting to be performed on unquoted parameter expansions.
Note that this option has nothing to do with word splitting.
(See the section Parameter Expansion .)</p>

<p>TRAPS_ASYNC While waiting for a program to exit, handle
signals and run traps immediately. Otherwise the trap is run
after a child pro- cess has exited. Note this does not
affect the point at which traps are run for any case other
than when the shell is waiting for a child process.</p>

<p>Shell State INTERACTIVE (-i, ksh: -i) This is an
interactive shell. This option is set upon initiali- sation
if the standard input is a tty and commands are being read
from standard input. (See the discussion of SHIN_STDIN.)
This heuristic may be overridden by specifying a state for
this option on the command line. The value of this option
can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the
shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is running.</p>

<p>LOGIN (-l, ksh: -l) This is a login shell. If this
option is not explicitly set, the shell is a login shell if
the first character of the argv[0] passed to the shell is a
-.</p>

<p>PRIVILEGED (-p, ksh: -p) Turn on privileged mode. This
is enabled automatically on startup if the effective user
(group) ID is not equal to the real user (group) ID. Turning
this option off causes the effec- tive user and group IDs to
be set to the real user and group IDs. This option disables
sourcing user startup files. If zsh is invoked as sh or ksh
with this option set, /etc/suid_pro- file is sourced (after
/etc/profile on interactive shells). Sourcing ~/.profile is
disabled and the contents of the ENV variable is ignored.
This option cannot be changed using the -m option of setopt
and unsetopt, and changing it inside a function always
changes it globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS
option.</p>

<p>RESTRICTED (-r) Enables restricted mode. This option
cannot be changed using unsetopt, and setting it inside a
function always changes it globally regardless of the
LOCAL_OPTIONS option. See the sec- tion Restricted
Shell.</p>

<p>SHIN_STDIN (-s, ksh: -s) Commands are being read from
the standard input. Commands are read from standard input if
no command is specified with -c and no file of commands is
specified. If SHIN_STDIN is set explic- itly on the command
line, any argument that would otherwise have been taken as a
file to run will instead be treated as a normal positional
parameter. Note that setting or unsetting this option on the
command line does not necessarily affect the state the
option will have while the shell is running - that is purely
an indicator of whether on not commands are actually being
read from standard input. The value of this option can only
be changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It
can- not be changed once zsh is running.</p>

<p>SINGLE_COMMAND (-t, ksh: -t) If the shell is reading
from standard input, it exits after a single command has
been executed. This also makes the shell non-interactive,
unless the INTERACTIVE option is explicitly set on the
command line. The value of this option can only be changed
via flags supplied at invocation of the shell. It can- not
be changed once zsh is running.</p>

<p>Zle BEEP (+B) &lt;D&gt; Beep on error in ZLE.</p>

<p>COMBINING_CHARS Assume that the terminal displays
combining characters cor- rectly. Specifically, if a base
alphanumeric character is fol- lowed by one or more
zero-width punctuation characters, assume that the
zero-width characters will be displayed as modifica- tions
to the base character within the same width. Not all ter-
minals handle this. If this option is not set, zero-width
char- acters are displayed separately with special
mark-up.</p>

<p>If this option is set, the pattern test [[:WORD:]]
matches a zero-width punctuation character on the assumption
that it will be used as part of a word in combination with a
word character. Otherwise the base shell does not handle
combining characters specially.</p>

<p>EMACS If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the
equivalent effect of bindkey -e. In addition, the VI option
is unset. Turning it off has no effect. The option setting
is not guaran- teed to reflect the current keymap. This
option is provided for compatibility; bindkey is the
recommended interface.</p>

<p>OVERSTRIKE Start up the line editor in overstrike
mode.</p>

<p>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE (-M) &lt;K&gt; Use single-line command
line editing instead of multi-line.</p>

<p>Note that although this is on by default in ksh
emulation it only provides superficial compatibility with
the ksh line editor and reduces the effectiveness of the zsh
line editor. As it has no effect on shell syntax, many users
may wish to disable this option when using ksh emulation
interactively.</p>

<p>VI If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the
equivalent effect of bindkey -v . In addition, the EMACS
option is unset. Turning it off has no effect. The option
setting is not guaran- teed to reflect the current keymap.
This option is provided for compatibility; bindkey is the
recommended interface.</p>

<p>ZLE (-Z) Use the zsh line editor. Set by default in
interactive shells connected to a terminal.</p>

<p>OPTION ALIASES Some options have alternative names.
These aliases are never used for output, but can be used
just like normal option names when specifying options to the
shell.</p>
