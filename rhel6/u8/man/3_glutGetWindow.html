<p>NAME glutGetWindow - Return the current window
identifier, 0 if undefined</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>int glutGetWindow(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION glutGetWindow() returns the window id of the
current window . This is useful, e.g., if you have a generic
function that is used with several windows and it needs to
temporarily change to another window. (There is no window
stack for you to use with pushes and pops. Do not be
confused by glutPushWindow() and glutPopWindow(); those
pushes and pops are not stack-related!)</p>

<p>One cause for the function to return 0 is if you have
called glutDestroy- Window() on the current window and have
done nothing to set a new win- dow as current.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO glutSetWindow(3)</p>
