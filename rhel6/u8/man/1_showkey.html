<p>SHOWKEY(1) SHOWKEY(1)</p>

<p>NAME showkey - examine the codes sent by the
keyboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS showkey [-h|--help] [-a|--ascii]
[-s|--scancodes] [-k|--keycodes]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION showkey prints to standard output either the
scan codes or the keycode or the ascii code of each key
pressed. In the first two modes the program runs until 10
seconds have elapsed since the last key press or release
event, or until it receives a suitable signal, like SIGTERM,
from another process. In ascii mode the program terminates
when the user types ^D.</p>

<p>When in scancode dump mode, showkey prints in
hexadecimal format each byte received from the keyboard to
the standard output. A new line is printed when an interval
of about 0.1 seconds occurs between the bytes received, or
when the internal receive buffer fills up. This can be used
to determine roughly, what byte sequences the keyboard sends
at once on a given key press. The scan code dumping mode is
primarily intended for debugging the keyboard driver or
other low level inter- faces. As such it shouldnt be of much
interest to the regular end- user. However, some modern
keyboards have keys or buttons that produce scancodes to
which the kernel does not associate a keycode, and, after
finding out what these are, the user can assign keycodes
with setkey- codes(8).</p>

<p>When in the default keycode dump mode, showkey prints to
the standard output the keycode number or each key pressed
or released. The kind of the event, press or release, is
also reported. Keycodes are numbers assigned by the kernel
to each individual physical key. Every key has always only
one associated keycode number, whether the keyboard sends
single or multiple scan codes when pressing it. Using
showkey in this mode, you can find out what numbers to use
in your personalized keymap files.</p>

<p>When in ascii dump mode, showkey prints to the standard
output the decimal, octal, and hexadecimal value(s) of the
key pressed, according to he present keymap.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h --help showkey prints to the standard error
output its version number, a compile option and a short
usage message, then exits.</p>

<p>-s --scancodes Starts showkey in scan code dump
mode.</p>

<p>-k --keycodes Starts showkey in keycode dump mode. This
is the default, when no command line options are
present.</p>

<p>-a --ascii Starts showkey in ascii dump mode.</p>

<p>2.6 KERNELS In 2.6 kernels key codes lie in the range
1-255, instead of 1-127. Key codes larger than 127 are
returned as three bytes of which the low order 7 bits are:
zero, bits 13-7, and bits 6-0 of the key code. The high
order bits are: 0/1 for make/break, 1, 1.</p>

<p>In 2.6 kernels raw mode, or scancode mode, is not very
raw at all. Scan codes are first translated to key codes,
and when scancodes are desired, the key codes are translated
back. Various transformations are involved, and there is no
guarantee at all that the final result corre- sponds to what
the keyboard hardware did send. So, if you want to know the
scan codes sent by various keys it is better to boot a 2.4
kernel. Since 2.6.9 there also is the boot option
atkbd.softraw=0 that tells the 2.6 kernel to return the
actual scan codes.</p>

<p>NOTES The raw scan codes are available only on AT and
PS/2 keyboards, and even then they are disabled unless the
atkbd.softraw=0 kernel parameter is used. When the raw scan
codes are not available, the kernel uses a fixed built-in
table to produce scan codes from keycodes. Thus, setk-
eycodes(8) can affect the output of showkey in scan code
dump mode.</p>
