<p>DESCRIPTION ebtables is an application program used to
set up and maintain the tables of rules (inside the Linux
kernel) that inspect Ethernet frames. It is analogous to the
iptables application, but less complicated, due to the fact
that the Ethernet protocol is much simpler than the IP pro-
tocol.</p>

<p>CHAINS There are three ebtables tables with built-in
chains in the Linux ker- nel. These tables are used to
divide functionality into different sets of rules. Each set
of rules is called a chain. Each chain is an ordered list of
rules that can match Ethernet frames. If a rule matches an
Ethernet frame, then a processing specification tells what
to do with that matching frame. The processing specification
is called a target . However, if the frame does not match
the current rule in the chain, then the next rule in the
chain is examined and so forth. The user can create new
(user-defined) chains that can be used as the tar- get of a
rule. User-defined chains are very useful to get better per-
formance over the linear traversal of the rules and are also
essential for structuring the filtering rules into
well-organized and maintain- able sets of rules.</p>

<p>TARGETS A firewall rule specifies criteria for an
Ethernet frame and a frame processing specification called a
target. When a frame matches a rule, then the next action
performed by the kernel is specified by the tar- get. The
target can be one of these values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE,
RETURN, an extension (see below) or a jump to a user-defined
chain.</p>

<p>ACCEPT means to let the frame through. DROP means the
frame has to be dropped. In the BROUTING chain however, the
ACCEPT and DROP target have different meanings (see the info
provided for the -t option). CONTINUE means the next rule
has to be checked. This can be handy, f.e., to know how many
frames pass a certain point in the chain, to log those
frames or to apply multiple targets on a frame. RETURN means
stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in
the previous (calling) chain. For the extension targets
please refer to the TARGET EXTENSIONS section of this man
page.</p>

<p>TABLES As stated earlier, there are three ebtables
tables in the Linux kernel. The table names are filter, nat
and broute. Of these three tables, the filter table is the
default table that the command operates on. If you are
working with the filter table, then you can drop the -t
filter argument to the ebtables command. However, you will
need to provide the -t argument for the other two tables.
Moreover, the -t argument must be the first argument on the
ebtables command line, if used.</p>

<p>-t, --table filter is the default table and contains
three built-in chains: INPUT (for frames destined for the
bridge itself, on the level of the MAC destination address),
OUTPUT (for locally-generated or (b)routed frames) and
FORWARD (for frames being forwarded by the bridge). nat is
mostly used to change the mac addresses and contains three
built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering frames as soon as
they come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally generated or
(b)routed frames before they are bridged) and POSTROUTING
(for altering frames as they are about to go out). A small
note on the naming of chains PREROUTING and POSTROUTING: it
would be more accurate to call them PREFORWARDING and
POSTFORWARDING, but for all those who come from the iptables
world to ebtables it is easier to have the same names. Note
that you can change the name (-E) if you dont like the
default. broute is used to make a brouter, it has one
built-in chain: BROUTING. The targets DROP and ACCEPT have a
special meaning in the broute table (these names are used
instead of more descrip- tive names to keep the
implementation generic). DROP actually means the frame has
to be routed, while ACCEPT means the frame has to be
bridged. The BROUTING chain is traversed very early.
However, it is only traversed by frames entering on a bridge
port that is in forwarding state. Normally those frames
would be bridged, but you can decide otherwise here. The
redirect target is very handy here.</p>

<p>EBTABLES COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS After the initial
ebtables -t table command line argument, the remaining
arguments can be divided into several groups. These groups
are commands, miscellaneous commands, rule specifications,
match exten- sions, watcher extensions and target
extensions.</p>

<p>COMMANDS The ebtables command arguments specify the
actions to perform on the table defined with the -t
argument. If you do not use the -t argument to name a table,
the commands apply to the default filter table. Only one
command may be used on the command line at a time, except
when the commands -L and -Z are combined, the commands -N
and -P are combined, or when --atomic-file is used.</p>

<p>-A, --append Append a rule to the end of the selected
chain.</p>

<p>-D, --delete Delete the specified rule or rules from the
selected chain. There are two ways to use this command. The
first is by specify- ing an interval of rule numbers to
delete (directly after -D). Syntax: start_nr[:end_nr] (use
-L --Ln to list the rules with their rule number). When
end_nr is omitted, all rules starting from start_nr are
deleted. Using negative numbers is allowed, for more details
about using negative numbers, see the -I com- mand. The
second usage is by specifying the complete rule as it would
have been specified when it was added. Only the first
encountered rule that is the same as this specified rule, in
other words the matching rule with the lowest (positive)
rule number, is deleted.</p>

<p>-C, --change-counters Change the counters of the
specified rule or rules from the selected chain. There are
two ways to use this command. The first is by specifying an
interval of rule numbers to do the changes on (directly
after -C). Syntax: start_nr[:end_nr] (use -L --Ln to list
the rules with their rule number). The details are the same
as for the -D command. The second usage is by spec- ifying
the complete rule as it would have been specified when it
was added. Only the counters of the first encountered rule
that is the same as this specified rule, in other words the
matching rule with the lowest (positive) rule number, are
changed. In the first usage, the counters are specified
directly after the interval specification, in the second
usage directly after -C. First the packet counter is
specified, then the byte counter. If the specified counters
start with a +, the counter values are added to the
respective current counter values. If the speci- fied
counters start with a -, the counter values are decreased
from the respective current counter values. No bounds
checking is done. If the counters dont start with + or -,
the cur- rent counters are changed to the specified
counters.</p>

<p>-I, --insert Insert the specified rule into the selected
chain at the speci- fied rule number. If the rule number is
not specified, the rule is added at the head of the chain.
If the current number of rules equals N, then the specified
number can be between -N and N+1. For a positive number i,
it holds that i and i-N-1 specify the same place in the
chain where the rule should be inserted. The rule number 0
specifies the place past the last rule in the chain and
using this number is therefore equivalent to using the -A
command. Rule numbers structly smaller than 0 can be useful
when more than one rule needs to be inserted in a chain.</p>

<p>-P, --policy Set the policy for the chain to the given
target. The policy can be ACCEPT, DROP or RETURN.</p>

<p>-F, --flush Flush the selected chain. If no chain is
selected, then every chain will be flushed. Flushing a chain
does not change the pol- icy of the chain, however.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero Set the counters of the selected chain to
zero. If no chain is selected, all the counters are set to
zero. The -Z command can be used in conjunction with the -L
command. When both the -Z and -L commands are used together
in this way, the rule counters are printed on the screen
before they are set to zero.</p>

<p>-L, --list List all rules in the selected chain. If no
chain is selected, all chains are listed. The following
options change the output of the -L command. --Ln Places the
rule number in front of every rule. This option is
incompatible with the --Lx option. --Lc Shows the counters
at the end of each rule displayed by the -L command. Both a
frame counter (pcnt) and a byte counter (bcnt) are
displayed. The frame counter shows how many frames have
matched the specific rule, the byte counter shows the sum of
the frame sizes of these matching frames. Using this option
in com- bination with the --Lx option causes the counters to
be written out in the -c &lt;pcnt&gt; &lt;bcnt&gt; option
format. --Lx Changes the output so that it produces a set of
ebtables com- mands that construct the contents of the
chain, when specified. If no chain is specified, ebtables
commands to construct the contents of the table are given,
including commands for creating the user-defined chains (if
any). You can use this set of com- mands in an ebtables boot
or reload script. For example the output could be used at
system startup. The --Lx option is incompatible with the
--Ln listing option. Using the --Lx option together with the
--Lc option will cause the counters to be written out in the
-c &lt;pcnt&gt; &lt;bcnt&gt; option format. --Lmac2 Shows
all MAC addresses with the same length, adding leading
zeroes if necessary. The default representation omits
leading zeroes in the addresses.</p>

<p>-N, --new-chain Create a new user-defined chain with the
given name. The number of user-defined chains is limited
only by the number of possible chain names. A user-defined
chain name has a maximum length of 31 characters. The
standard policy of the user-defined chain is ACCEPT. The
policy of the new chain can be initialized to a dif- ferent
standard target by using the -P command together with the -N
command. In this case, the chain name does not have to be
specified for the -P command.</p>

<p>-X, --delete-chain Delete the specified user-defined
chain. There must be no remaining references (jumps) to the
specified chain, otherwise ebtables will refuse to delete
it. If no chain is specified, all user-defined chains that
arent referenced will be removed.</p>

<p>-E, --rename-chain Rename the specified chain to a new
name. Besides renaming a user-defined chain, you can rename
a standard chain to a name that suits your taste. For
example, if you like PREFORWARDING more than PREROUTING,
then you can use the -E command to rename the PREROUTING
chain. If you do rename one of the standard ebta- bles chain
names, please be sure to mention this fact should you post a
question on the ebtables mailing lists. It would be wise to
use the standard name in your post. Renaming a standard
ebta- bles chain in this fashion has no effect on the
structure or functioning of the ebtables kernel table.</p>

<p>--init-table Replace the current table data by the
initial table data.</p>

<p>--atomic-init Copy the kernel s initial data of the
table to the specified file. This can be used as the first
action, after which rules are added to the file. The file
can be specified using the --atomic-file command or through
the EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE envi- ronment variable.</p>

<p>--atomic-save Copy the kernel s current data of the
table to the specified file. This can be used as the first
action, after which rules are added to the file. The file
can be specified using the --atomic-file command or through
the EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE envi- ronment variable.</p>

<p>--atomic-commit Replace the kernel table data with the
data contained in the specified file. This is a useful
command that allows you to load all your rules of a certain
table into the kernel at once, sav- ing the kernel a lot of
precious time and allowing atomic updates of the tables. The
file which contains the table data is constructed by using
either the --atomic-init or the --atomic- save command to
generate a starting file. After that, using the
--atomic-file command when constructing rules or setting the
EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE environment variable allows you to
extend the file and build the complete table before
committing it to the kernel. This command can be very useful
in boot scripts to populate the ebtables tables in a fast
way.</p>

<p>MISCELLANOUS COMMANDS -V, --version Show the version of
the ebtables userspace program.</p>

<p>-h, --help [list of module names] Give a brief
description of the command syntax. Here you can also specify
names of extensions and ebtables will try to write help
about those extensions. E.g. ebtables -h snat log ip arp.
Specify list_extensions to list all extensions supported by
the userspace utility.</p>

<p>-j, --jump target The target of the rule. This is one of
the following values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE, RETURN, a
target extension (see TARGET EXTENSIONS) or a user-defined
chain name.</p>

<p>--atomic-file file Let the command operate on the
specified file. The data of the table to operate on will be
extracted from the file and the result of the operation will
be saved back into the file. If specified, this option
should come before the command specifica- tion. An
alternative that should be preferred, is setting the
EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE environment variable.</p>

<p>-M, --modprobe program When talking to the kernel, use
this program to try to automati- cally load missing kernel
modules.</p>

<p>RULE SPECIFICATIONS The following command line arguments
make up a rule specification (as used in the add and delete
commands). A &quot;!&quot; option before the specifi- cation
inverts the test for that specification. Apart from these
stan- dard rule specifications there are some other command
line arguments of interest. See both the MATCH EXTENSIONS
and the WATCHER EXTENSIONS below.</p>

<p>-p, --protocol [!] protocol The protocol that was
responsible for creating the frame. This can be a
hexadecimal number, above 0x0600, a name (e.g. ARP ) or
LENGTH. The protocol field of the Ethernet frame can be used
to denote the length of the header (802.2/802.3 networks).
When the value of that field is below or equals 0x0600, the
value equals the size of the header and shouldnt be used as
a proto- col number. Instead, all frames where the protocol
field is used as the length field are assumed to be of the
same protocol. The protocol name used in ebtables for these
frames is LENGTH. The file /etc/ethertypes can be used to
show readable characters instead of hexadecimal numbers for
the protocols. For example, 0x0800 will be represented by
IPV4. The use of this file is not case sensitive. See that
file for more information. The flag --proto is an alias for
this option.</p>

<p>-i, --in-interface [!] name The interface (bridge port)
via which a frame is received (this option is useful in the
INPUT, FORWARD, PREROUTING and BROUTING chains). If the
interface name ends with +, then any interface name that
begins with this name (disregarding + ) will match. The flag
--in-if is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>--logical-in [!] name The (logical) bridge interface via
which a frame is received (this option is useful in the
INPUT, FORWARD, PREROUTING and BROUTING chains). If the
interface name ends with +, then any interface name that
begins with this name (disregarding +) will match.</p>

<p>-o, --out-interface [!] name The interface (bridge port)
via which a frame is going to be sent (this option is useful
in the OUTPUT, FORWARD and POSTROUT- ING chains). If the
interface name ends with +, then any interface name that
begins with this name (disregarding +) will match. The flag
--out-if is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>--logical-out [!] name The (logical) bridge interface
via which a frame is going to be sent (this option is useful
in the OUTPUT, FORWARD and POSTROUT- ING chains). If the
interface name ends with +, then any interface name that
begins with this name (disregarding +) will match.</p>

<p>-s, --source [!] address[/mask] The source MAC address.
Both mask and address are written as 6 hexadecimal numbers
separated by colons. Alternatively one can specify Unicast,
Multicast, Broadcast or BGA (Bridge Group Address):
Unicast=00:00:00:00:00:00/01:00:00:00:00:00, Multi-
cast=01:00:00:00:00:00/01:00:00:00:00:00, Broad-
cast=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff or
BGA=01:80:c2:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Note that a
broadcast address will also match the multicast
specification. The flag --src is an alias for this
option.</p>

<p>-d, --destination [!] address[/mask] The destination MAC
address. See -s (above) for more details on MAC addresses.
The flag --dst is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>-c, --set-counter pcnt bcnt If used with -A or -I, then
the packet and byte counters of the new rule will be set to
pcnt, resp. bcnt. If used with the -C or -D commands, only
rules with a packet and byte count equal to pcnt, resp. bcnt
will match.</p>

<p>MATCH EXTENSIONS Ebtables extensions are dynamically
loaded into the userspace tool, there is therefore no need
to explicitly load them with a -m option like is done in
iptables. These extensions deal with functionality supported
by kernel modules supplemental to the core ebtables
code.</p>

<p>802_3 Specify 802.3 DSAP/SSAP fields or SNAP type. The
protocol must be specified as LENGTH (see the option -p
above).</p>

<p>--802_3-sap [!] sap DSAP and SSAP are two one byte 802.3
fields. The bytes are always equal, so only one byte
(hexadecimal) is needed as an argument.</p>

<p>--802_3-type [!] type If the 802.3 DSAP and SSAP values
are 0xaa then the SNAP type field must be consulted to
determine the payload protocol. This is a two byte
(hexadecimal) argument. Only 802.3 frames with DSAP/SSAP
0xaa are checked for type.</p>

<p>among Match a MAC address or MAC/IP address pair versus
a list of MAC addresses and MAC/IP address pairs. A list
entry has the following format:
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx[=ip.ip.ip.ip][,]. Multiple list entries
are separated by a comma, specifying an IP address
corresponding to the MAC address is optional. Multiple
MAC/IP address pairs with the same MAC address but different
IP address (and vice versa) can be specified. If the MAC
address doesn t match any entry from the list, the frame
doesnt match the rule (unless &quot;!&quot; was used).</p>

<p>--among-dst [!] list Compare the MAC destination to the
given list. If the Ethernet frame has type IPv4 or ARP, then
comparison with MAC/IP destina- tion address pairs from the
list is possible.</p>

<p>--among-src [!] list Compare the MAC source to the given
list. If the Ethernet frame has type IPv4 or ARP, then
comparison with MAC/IP source address pairs from the list is
possible.</p>

<p>--among-dst-file [!] file Same as --among-dst but the
list is read in from the specified file.</p>

<p>--among-src-file [!] file Same as --among-src but the
list is read in from the specified file.</p>

<p>arp Specify (R)ARP fields. The protocol must be
specified as ARP or RARP.</p>

<p>--arp-opcode [!] opcode The (R)ARP opcode (decimal or a
string, for more details see ebtables -h arp).</p>

<p>--arp-htype [!] hardware type The hardware type, this
can be a decimal or the string Ethernet (which sets type to
1). Most (R)ARP packets have Eternet as hardware type.</p>

<p>--arp-ptype [!] protocol type The protocol type for
which the (r)arp is used (hexadecimal or the string IPv4,
denoting 0x0800). Most (R)ARP packets have protocol type
IPv4.</p>

<p>--arp-ip-src [!] address[/mask] The (R)ARP IP source
address specification.</p>

<p>--arp-ip-dst [!] address[/mask] The (R)ARP IP
destination address specification.</p>

<p>--arp-mac-src [!] address[/mask] The (R)ARP MAC source
address specification.</p>

<p>--arp-mac-dst [!] address[/mask] The (R)ARP MAC
destination address specification.</p>

<p>[!] --arp-gratuitous Checks for ARP gratuitous packets:
checks equality of IPv4 source address and IPv4 destination
address inside the ARP header.</p>

<p>ip Specify IPv4 fields. The protocol must be specified
as IPv4.</p>

<p>--ip-source [!] address[/mask] The source IP address.
The flag --ip-src is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>--ip-destination [!] address[/mask] The destination IP
address. The flag --ip-dst is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>--ip-tos [!] tos The IP type of service, in hexadecimal
numbers. IPv4.</p>

<p>--ip-protocol [!] protocol The IP protocol. The flag
--ip-proto is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>--ip-source-port [!] port1[:port2] The source port or
port range for the IP protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33 (DCCP)
or 132 (SCTP). The --ip-protocol option must be specified as
TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omitted, 0:port2 is
used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is specified,
port1:65535 is used. The flag --ip-sport is an alias for
this option.</p>

<p>--ip-destination-port [!] port1[:port2] The destination
port or port range for ip protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33
(DCCP) or 132 (SCTP). The --ip-protocol option must be
specified as TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omitted,
0:port2 is used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is
specified, port1:65535 is used. The flag --ip-dport is an
alias for this option.</p>

<p>ip6 Specify IPv6 fields. The protocol must be specified
as IPv6.</p>

<p>--ip6-source [!] address[/mask] The source IPv6 address.
The flag --ip6-src is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>--ip6-destination [!] address[/mask] The destination
IPv6 address. The flag --ip6-dst is an alias for this
option.</p>

<p>--ip6-tclass [!] tclass The IPv6 traffic class, in
hexadecimal numbers.</p>

<p>--ip6-protocol [!] protocol The IP protocol. The flag
--ip6-proto is an alias for this option.</p>

<p>--ip6-source-port [!] port1[:port2] The source port or
port range for the IPv6 protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33
(DCCP) or 132 (SCTP). The --ip6-protocol option must be
specified as TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omitted,
0:port2 is used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is
specified, port1:65535 is used. The flag --ip6-sport is an
alias for this option.</p>

<p>--ip6-destination-port [!] port1[:port2] The destination
port or port range for IPv6 protocols 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 33
(DCCP) or 132 (SCTP). The --ip6-protocol option must be
specified as TCP, UDP, DCCP or SCTP. If port1 is omit- ted,
0:port2 is used; if port2 is omitted but a colon is speci-
fied, port1:65535 is used. The flag --ip6-dport is an alias
for this option.</p>

<p>limit This module matches at a limited rate using a
token bucket filter. A rule using this extension will match
until this limit is reached. It can be used with the --log
watcher to give limited logging, for exam- ple. Its use is
the same as the limit match of iptables.</p>

<p>--limit [value] Maximum average matching rate: specified
as a number, with an optional /second, /minute, /hour, or
/day suffix; the default is 3/hour.</p>

<p>--limit-burst [number] Maximum initial number of packets
to match: this number gets recharged by one every time the
limit specified above is not reached, up to this number; the
default is 5.</p>

<p>mark_m --mark [!] [value][/mask] Matches frames with the
given unsigned mark value. If a value and mask are
specified, the logical AND of the mark value of the frame
and the user-specified mask is taken before comparing it
with the user-specified mark value. When only a mark value
is specified, the packet only matches when the mark value of
the frame equals the user-specified mark value. If only a
mask is specified, the logical AND of the mark value of the
frame and the user-specified mask is taken and the frame
matches when the result of this logical AND is non-zero.
Only specifying a mask is useful to match multiple mark
values.</p>

<p>pkttype --pkttype-type [!] type Matches on the Ethernet
&quot;class&quot; of the frame, which is deter- mined by the
generic networking code. Possible values: broadcast (MAC
destination is the broadcast address), multicast (MAC des-
tination is a multicast address), host (MAC destination is
the receiving network device), or otherhost (none of the
above).</p>

<p>stp Specify stp BPDU (bridge protocol data unit) fields.
The destination address (-d) must be specified as the bridge
group address (BGA). For all options for which a range of
values can be specified, it holds that if the lower bound is
omitted (but the colon is not), then the lowest possible
lower bound for that option is used, while if the upper
bound is omitted (but the colon again is not), the highest
possible upper bound for that option is used.</p>

<p>--stp-type [!] type The BPDU type (0-255), recognized
non-numerical types are con- fig, denoting a configuration
BPDU (=0), and tcn, denothing a topology change notification
BPDU (=128).</p>

<p>--stp-flags [!] flag The BPDU flag (0-255), recognized
non-numerical flags are topol- ogy-change, denoting the
topology change flag (=1), and topol- ogy-change-ack,
denoting the topology change acknowledgement flag
(=128).</p>

<p>--stp-root-prio [!] [prio][:prio] The root priority
(0-65535) range.</p>

<p>--stp-root-addr [!] [address][/mask] The root mac
address, see the option -s for more details.</p>

<p>--stp-root-cost [!] [cost][:cost] The root path cost
(0-4294967295) range.</p>

<p>--stp-sender-prio [!] [prio][:prio] The BPDUs sender
priority (0-65535) range.</p>

<p>--stp-sender-addr [!] [address][/mask] The BPDUs sender
mac address, see the option -s for more details.</p>

<p>--stp-port [!] [port][:port] The port identifier
(0-65535) range.</p>

<p>--stp-msg-age [!] [age][:age] The message age timer
(0-65535) range.</p>

<p>--stp-max-age [!] [age][:age] The max age timer
(0-65535) range.</p>

<p>--stp-hello-time [!] [time][:time] The hello time timer
(0-65535) range.</p>

<p>--stp-forward-delay [!] [delay][:delay] The forward
delay timer (0-65535) range.</p>

<p>vlan Specify 802.1Q Tag Control Information fields. The
protocol must be specified as 802_1Q (0x8100).</p>

<p>--vlan-id [!] id The VLAN identifier field (VID).
Decimal number from 0 to 4095.</p>

<p>--vlan-prio [!] prio The user priority field, a decimal
number from 0 to 7. The VID should be set to 0 (&quot;null
VID&quot;) or unspecified (in the latter case the VID is
deliberately set to 0).</p>

<p>--vlan-encap [!] type The encapsulated Ethernet frame
type/length. Specified as a hexadecimal number from 0x0000
to 0xFFFF or as a symbolic name from /etc/ethertypes.</p>

<p>WATCHER EXTENSIONS Watchers only look at frames passing
by, they dont modify them nor decide to accept the frames or
not. These watchers only see the frame if the frame matches
the rule, and they see it before the target is executed.</p>

<p>log The log watcher writes descriptive data about a
frame to the syslog.</p>

<p>--log Log with the default loggin options: log-level=
info, log-pre- fix=&quot;&quot;, no ip logging, no arp
logging.</p>

<p>--log-level level Defines the logging level. For the
possible values, see ebtables -h log. The default level is
info.</p>

<p>--log-prefix text Defines the prefix text to be printed
at the beginning of the line with the logging
information.</p>

<p>--log-ip Will log the ip information when a frame made
by the ip protocol matches the rule. The default is no ip
information logging.</p>

<p>--log-ip6 Will log the ipv6 information when a frame
made by the ipv6 pro- tocol matches the rule. The default is
no ipv6 information log- ging.</p>

<p>--log-arp Will log the (r)arp information when a frame
made by the (r)arp protocols matches the rule. The default
is no (r)arp information logging.</p>

<p>nflog The nflog watcher passes the packet to the loaded
logging backend in order to log the packet. This is usually
used in combination with nfnetlink_log as logging backend,
which will multicast the packet through a netlink socket to
the specified multicast group. One or more userspace
processes may subscribe to the group to receive the
packets.</p>

<p>--nflog Log with the default logging options</p>

<p>--nflog-group nlgroup The netlink group (1 - 2^32-1) to
which packets are (only appli- cable for nfnetlink_log). The
default value is 1.</p>

<p>--nflog-prefix prefix A prefix string to include in the
log message, up to 30 charac- ters long, useful for
distinguishing messages in the logs.</p>

<p>--nflog-range size The number of bytes to be copied to
userspace (only applicable for nfnetlink_log). nfnetlink_log
instances may specify their own range, this option overrides
it.</p>

<p>--nflog-threshold size Number of packets to queue inside
the kernel before sending them to userspace (only applicable
for nfnetlink_log). Higher values result in less overhead
per packet, but increase delay until the packets reach
userspace. The default value is 1.</p>

<p>ulog The ulog watcher passes the packet to a userspace
logging daemon using netlink multicast sockets. This differs
from the log watcher in the sense that the complete packet
is sent to userspace instead of a descriptive text and that
netlink multicast sockets are used instead of the syslog.
This watcher enables parsing of packets with userspace
programs, the physical bridge in and out ports are also
included in the netlink messages. The ulog watcher module
accepts 2 parameters when the module is loaded into the
kernel (e.g. with modprobe): nlbufsiz specifies how big the
buffer for each netlink multicast group is. If you say
nlbufsiz=8192, for example, up to eight kB of packets will
get accumulated in the kernel until they are sent to
userspace. It is not possible to allocate more than 128kB.
Please also keep in mind that this buffer size is allocated
for each nlgroup you are using, so the total kernel memory
usage increases by that factor. The default is 4096.
flushtimeout specifies after how many hundredths of a second
the queue should be flushed, even if it is not full yet. The
default is 10 (one tenth of a second).</p>

<p>--ulog Use the default settings:
ulog-prefix=&quot;&quot;, ulog-nlgroup=1, ulog-
cprange=4096, ulog-qthreshold=1.</p>

<p>--ulog-prefix text Defines the prefix included with the
packets sent to userspace.</p>

<p>--ulog-nlgroup group Defines which netlink group number
to use (a number from 1 to 32). Make sure the netlink group
numbers used for the iptables ULOG target differ from those
used for the ebtables ulog watcher. The default group number
is 1.</p>

<p>--ulog-cprange range Defines the maximum copy range to
userspace, for packets match- ing the rule. The default
range is 0, which means the maximum copy range is given by
nlbufsiz. A maximum copy range larger than 128*1024 is
meaningless as the packets sent to userspace have an upper
size limit of 128*1024.</p>

<p>--ulog-qthreshold threshold Queue at most threshold
number of packets before sending them to userspace with a
netlink socket. Note that packets can be sent to userspace
before the queue is full, this happens when the ulog kernel
timer goes off (the frequency of this timer depends on
flushtimeout).</p>

<p>TARGET EXTENSIONS arpreply The arpreply target can be
used in the PREROUTING chain of the nat ta- ble. If this
target sees an ARP request it will automatically reply with
an ARP reply. The used MAC address for the reply can be
specified. The protocol must be specified as ARP. When the
ARP message is not an ARP request or when the ARP request
isn t for an IP address on an Eth- ernet network, it is
ignored by this target (CONTINUE). When the ARP request is
malformed, it is dropped (DROP).</p>

<p>--arpreply-mac address Specifies the MAC address to
reply with: the Ethernet source MAC and the ARP payload
source MAC will be filled in with this address.</p>

<p>--arpreply-target target Specifies the standard target.
After sending the ARP reply, the rule still has to give a
standard target so ebtables knows what to do with the ARP
request. The default target is DROP.</p>

<p>AUDIT This target allows to create audit records for
packets hitting the tar- get. It can be used to record
accepted, dropped, and rejected packets. See auditd(8) for
additional details.</p>

<p>--type {accept|drop|reject} Set type of audit
record.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>ebtables -N AUDIT_DROP</p>

<p>ebtables -A AUDIT_DROP -j AUDIT --type drop</p>

<p>ebtables -A AUDIT_DROP -j DROP</p>

<p>dnat The dnat target can only be used in the BROUTING
chain of the broute table and the PREROUTING and OUTPUT
chains of the nat table. It speci- fies that the destination
MAC address has to be changed.</p>

<p>--to-destination address Change the destination MAC
address to the specified address. The flag --to-dst is an
alias for this option.</p>

<p>--dnat-target target Specifies the standard target.
After doing the dnat, the rule still has to give a standard
target so ebtables knows what to do with the dnated frame.
The default target is ACCEPT. Making it CONTINUE could let
you use multiple target extensions on the same frame. Making
it DROP only makes sense in the BROUTING chain but using the
redirect target is more logical there. RETURN is also
allowed. Note that using RETURN in a base chain is not
allowed (for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>mark The mark target can be used in every chain of every
table. It is possi- ble to use the marking of a frame/packet
in both ebtables and iptables, if the bridge-nf code is
compiled into the kernel. Both put the marking at the same
place. This allows for a form of communication between
ebtables and iptables.</p>

<p>--mark-set value Mark the frame with the specified
non-negative value.</p>

<p>--mark-or value Or the frame with the specified
non-negative value.</p>

<p>--mark-and value And the frame with the specified
non-negative value.</p>

<p>--mark-xor value Xor the frame with the specified
non-negative value.</p>

<p>--mark-target target Specifies the standard target.
After marking the frame, the rule still has to give a
standard target so ebtables knows what to do. The default
target is ACCEPT. Making it CONTINUE can let you do other
things with the frame in subsequent rules of the chain.</p>

<p>redirect The redirect target will change the MAC target
address to that of the bridge device the frame arrived on.
This target can only be used in the BROUTING chain of the
broute table and the PREROUTING chain of the nat table. In
the BROUTING chain, the MAC address of the bridge port is
used as destination address, in the PREROUTING chain, the
MAC address of the bridge is used.</p>

<p>--redirect-target target Specifies the standard target.
After doing the MAC redirect, the rule still has to give a
standard target so ebtables knows what to do. The default
target is ACCEPT. Making it CONTINUE could let you use
multiple target extensions on the same frame. Making it DROP
in the BROUTING chain will let the frames be routed. RETURN
is also allowed. Note that using RETURN in a base chain is
not allowed.</p>

<p>snat The snat target can only be used in the POSTROUTING
chain of the nat table. It specifies that the source MAC
address has to be changed.</p>

<p>--to-source address Changes the source MAC address to
the specified address. The flag --to-src is an alias for
this option.</p>

<p>--snat-target target Specifies the standard target.
After doing the snat, the rule still has to give a standard
target so ebtables knows what to do. The default target is
ACCEPT. Making it CONTINUE could let you use multiple target
extensions on the same frame. Making it DROP doesnt make
sense, but you could do that too. RETURN is also allowed.
Note that using RETURN in a base chain is not allowed.</p>

<p>--snat-arp Also change the hardware source address
inside the arp header if the packet is an arp message and
the hardware address length in the arp header is 6
bytes.</p>
