<p>Tcl_Interp(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_Interp(3)</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_Interp - client-visible fields of interpreter
structures</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>typedef struct { char *result; Tcl_FreeProc *freeProc;
int errorLine; } Tcl_Interp;</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *blockPtr);
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Tcl_CreateInterp procedure returns a
pointer to a Tcl_Interp struc- ture. This pointer is then
passed into other Tcl procedures to process commands in the
interpreter and perform other operations on the inter-
preter. Interpreter structures contain many fields that are
used by Tcl, but only three that may be accessed by clients:
result, freeProc, and errorLine.</p>

<p>Note that access to all three fields, result, freeProc
and errorLine is deprecated. Use Tcl_SetResult,
Tcl_GetResult, and Tcl_GetReturnOptions instead.</p>

<p>The result and freeProc fields are used to return
results or error mes- sages from commands. This information
is returned by command proce- dures back to Tcl_Eval, and by
Tcl_Eval back to its callers. The result field points to the
string that represents the result or error message, and the
freeProc field tells how to dispose of the storage for the
string when it is not needed anymore. The easiest way for
command procedures to manipulate these fields is to call
procedures like Tcl_SetResult or Tcl_AppendResult; they will
hide all the details of managing the fields. The description
below is for those procedures that manipulate the fields
directly.</p>

<p>Whenever a command procedure returns, it must ensure
that the result field of its interpreter points to the
string being returned by the command. The result field must
always point to a valid string. If a command wishes to
return no result then interp-&gt;result should point to an
empty string. Normally, results are assumed to be statically
allo- cated, which means that the contents will not change
before the next time Tcl_Eval is called or some other
command procedure is invoked. In this case, the freeProc
field must be zero. Alternatively, a command procedure may
dynamically allocate its return value (e.g. using Tcl_Alloc)
and store a pointer to it in interp-&gt;result. In this
case, the command procedure must also set
interp-&gt;freeProc to the address of a procedure that can
free the value, or TCL_DYNAMIC if the storage was allocated
directly by Tcl or by a call to Tcl_Alloc. If
interp-&gt;freeP- roc is non-zero, then Tcl will call
freeProc to free the space pointed to by interp-&gt;result
before it invokes the next command. If a client procedure
overwrites interp-&gt;result when interp-&gt;freeProc is
non-zero, then it is responsible for calling freeProc to
free the old interp-&gt;result (the Tcl_FreeResult macro
should be used for this pur- pose).</p>

<p>FreeProc should have arguments and result that match the
Tcl_FreeProc declaration above: it receives a single
argument which is a pointer to the result value to free. In
most applications TCL_DYNAMIC is the only non-zero value
ever used for freeProc. However, an application may store a
different procedure address in freeProc in order to use an
alternate memory allocator or in order to do other cleanup
when the result memory is freed.</p>

<p>As part of processing each command, Tcl_Eval initializes
interp-&gt;result and interp-&gt;freeProc just before
calling the command procedure for the command. The freeProc
field will be initialized to zero, and interp-&gt;result
will point to an empty string. Commands that do not return
any value can simply leave the fields alone. Furthermore,
the empty string pointed to by result is actually part of an
array of TCL_RESULT_SIZE characters (approximately 200). If
a command wishes to return a short string, it can simply
copy it to the area pointed to by interp-&gt;result. Or, it
can use the sprintf procedure to generate a short result
string at the location pointed to by interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>It is a general convention in Tcl-based applications
that the result of an interpreter is normally in the
initialized state described in the previous paragraph.
Procedures that manipulate an interpreters result (e.g. by
returning an error) will generally assume that the result
has been initialized when the procedure is called. If such a
procedure is to be called after the result has been changed,
then Tcl_ResetResult should be called first to reset the
result to its initialized state. The direct use of
interp-&gt;result is strongly deprecated (see Tcl_SetRe-
sult).</p>

<p>The errorLine field is valid only after Tcl_Eval returns
a TCL_ERROR return code. In this situation the errorLine
field identifies the line number of the command being
executed when the error occurred. The line numbers are
relative to the command being executed: 1 means the first
line of the command passed to Tcl_Eval, 2 means the second
line, and so on. The errorLine field is typically used in
conjunction with Tcl_AddErrorInfo to report information
about where an error occurred. ErrorLine should not normally
be modified except by Tcl_Eval.</p>
