<p>QSTAT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QSTAT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qstat - show status of batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qstat [-f] job_identifier ...</p>

<p>qstat -Q [-f] destination ...</p>

<p>qstat -B [-f] server_name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The status of a batch job, batch queue, or
batch server is obtained by a request to the server. The
qstat utility is a user-accessible batch client that
requests the status of one or more batch jobs, batch queues,
or servers, and writes the status information to standard
out- put.</p>

<p>For each successfully processed batch job_identifier,
the qstat utility shall display information about the
corresponding batch job.</p>

<p>For each successfully processed destination, the qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding
batch queue.</p>

<p>For each successfully processed server name, the qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding
server.</p>

<p>The qstat utility shall acquire batch job status
information by sending a Job Status Request to a batch
server. The qstat utility shall acquire batch queue status
information by sending a Queue Status Request to a batch
server. The qstat utility shall acquire server sta- tus
information by sending a Server Status Request to a batch
server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The qstat utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-f Specify that a full display is produced.</p>

<p>The minimum contents of a full display are specified in
the STDOUT sec- tion.</p>

<p>Additional contents and format of a full display are
implementation- defined.</p>

<p>-Q Specify that the operand is a destination.</p>

<p>The qstat utility shall display information about each
batch queue at each destination identified as an
operand.</p>

<p>-B Specify that the operand is a server name.</p>

<p>The qstat utility shall display information about each
server identi- fied as an operand.</p>

<p>OPERANDS If the -Q option is presented to the qstat
utility, the utility shall accept one or more operands that
conform to the syntax for a destina- tion (see Destination
).</p>

<p>If the -B option is presented to the qstat utility, the
utility shall accept one or more server_name operands.</p>

<p>If neither the -B nor the -Q option is presented to the
qstat utility, the utility shall accept one or more operands
that conform to the syn- tax for a batch job_identifier (see
Batch Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qstat:</p>

<p>HOME Determine the pathname of the users home
directory.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p>Determine the locale for selecting the radix character
used when writing floating-point formatted output.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If an operand presented to the qstat utility is a
batch job_identifier and the -f option is not specified, the
qstat utility shall display the following items on a single
line, in the stated order, with white space between each
item, for each successfully processed operand:</p>

<p>* The batch job_identifier</p>

<p>* The batch job name</p>

<p>* The Job_Owner attribute</p>

<p>* The CPU time used by the batch job</p>

<p>* The batch job state</p>

<p>* The batch job location</p>

<p>If an operand presented to the qstat utility is a batch
job_identifier and the -f option is specified, the qstat
utility shall display the following items for each success
fully processed operand:</p>

<p>* The batch job_identifier</p>

<p>* The batch job name</p>

<p>* The Job_Owner attribute</p>

<p>* The execution user ID</p>

<p>* The CPU time used by the batch job</p>

<p>* The batch job state</p>

<p>* The batch job location</p>

<p>* Additional implementation-defined information, if any,
about the batch job or batch queue</p>

<p>If an operand presented to the qstat utility is a
destination, the -Q option is specified, and the -f option
is not specified, the qstat utility shall display the
following items on a single line, in the stated order, with
white space between each item, for each successfully
processed operand:</p>

<p>* The batch queue name</p>

<p>* The maximum number of batch jobs that shall be run in
the batch queue concurrently</p>

<p>* The total number of batch jobs in the batch queue</p>

<p>* The status of the batch queue</p>

<p>* For each state, the number of batch jobs in that state
in the batch queue and the name of the state</p>

<p>* The type of batch queue (execution or routing)</p>

<p>If the operands presented to the qstat utility are
destinations, the -Q option is specified, and the -f option
is specified, the qstat utility shall display the following
items for each successfully processed operand:</p>

<p>* The batch queue name</p>

<p>* The maximum number of batch jobs that shall be run in
the batch queue concurrently</p>

<p>* The total number of batch jobs in the batch queue</p>

<p>* The status of the batch queue</p>

<p>* For each state, the number of batch jobs in that state
in the batch queue and the name of the state</p>

<p>* The type of batch queue (execution or routing)</p>

<p>* Additional implementation-defined information, if any,
about the batch queue</p>

<p>If the operands presented to the qstat utility are batch
server names, the -B option is specified, and the -f option

the batch queue concurrently</p>

<p>* The total number of batch jobs managed by the batch
server</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qstat utility shall not be required to write a
diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qstat utility waits to output the diagnostic message
while attempting to locate the batch job on other servers is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qstat utility allows users to display the
status of jobs and list the batch jobs in queues.</p>

<p>The operands of the qstat utility may be either job
identifiers, queues (specified as destination identifiers),
or batch server names. The -Q and -B options, or absence
thereof, indicate the nature of the operands.</p>

<p>The other options of the qstat utility allow the user to
control the amount of information displayed and the format
in which it is dis- played. Should a user wish to display
the status of a set of jobs that match a selection criteria,
the qselect utility may be used to acquire such a list.</p>

<p>The -f option allows users to request a &quot;full&quot;
display in an implemen- tation-defined format.</p>

<p>Historically, the qstat utility has been a part of the
NQS and its derivatives, the existing practice on which it
is based.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
