<p>LOCALEDEF(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
LOCALEDEF(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME localedef - define locale environment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS localedef [-c][-f charmap][-i sourcefile][-u
code_set_name] name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The localedef utility shall convert source
definitions for locale cate- gories into a format usable by
the functions and utilities whose opera- tional behavior is
determined by the setting of the locale environment
variables defined in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 7, Locale. It is implementation-defined
whether users have the capability to create new locales, in
addition to those supplied by the implementation. If the
symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF is defined, the system
supports the creation of new locales. On XSI-conformant
systems, the symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF shall be
defined.</p>

<p>The utility shall read source definitions for one or
more locale cate- gories belonging to the same locale from
the file named in the -i option (if specified) or from
standard input.</p>

<p>The name operand identifies the target locale. The
utility shall sup- port the creation of public, or generally
accessible locales, as well as private, or restricted-access
locales. Implementations may restrict the capability to
create or modify public locales to users with the
appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>Each category source definition shall be identified by
the correspond- ing environment variable name and terminated
by an END category-name statement. The following categories
shall be supported. In addition, the input may contain
source for implementation-defined categories.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Defines character classification and case
conversion.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Defines collation rules.</p>

<p>LC_MONETARY</p>

<p>Defines the format and symbols used in formatting of
monetary information.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p>Defines the decimal delimiter, grouping, and grouping
symbol for non-monetary numeric editing.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Defines the format and content of date and time
information.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES</p>

<p>Defines the format and values of affirmative and
negative responses.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The localedef utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Create permanent output even if warning messages have
been issued.</p>

<p>-f charmap Specify the pathname of a file containing a
mapping of character symbols and collating element symbols
to actual character encod- ings. The format of the charmap
is described in the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 6.4, Character Set Description File.
The application shall ensure that this option is specified
if symbolic names (other than collating symbols defined in a
collating-symbol keyword) are used. If the -f option is not
present, an implementation-defined character map- ping shall
be used.</p>

<p>-i inputfile The pathname of a file containing the
source definitions. If this option is not present, source
definitions shall be read from standard input. The format of
the inputfile is described in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 7.3, Locale Definition.</p>

<p>-u code_set_name</p>

<p>Specify the name of a codeset used as the target mapping
of character symbols and collating element symbols whose
encoding values are defined in terms of the ISO/IEC
10646-1:2000 standard position constant values.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>name Identifies the locale; see the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7, Locale for a
description of the use of this name. If the name contains
one or more slash charac- ters, name shall be interpreted as
a pathname where the created locale definitions shall be
stored. If name does not contain any slash characters, the
interpretation of the name is implementa- tion-defined and
the locale shall be public. This capability may be
restricted to users with appropriate privileges. (As a
conse- quence of specifying one name, although several
categories can be processed in one execution, only
categories belonging to the same locale can be
processed.)</p>

<p>STDIN Unless the -i option is specified, the standard
input shall be a text file containing one or more locale
category source definitions, as described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Sec- tion 7.3,
Locale Definition. When lines are continued using the escape
character mechanism, there is no limit to the length of the
accumulated continued line.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The character set mapping file specified as
the charmap option-argument is described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.4,
Character Set Description File. If a locale category source
definition contains a copy statement, as defined in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7,
Locale, and the copy statement names a valid, existing
locale, then localedef shall behave as if the source
definition had contained a valid category source definition
for the named locale.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of localedef:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>(This variable has no affect on localedef; the POSIX
locale is used for this category.)</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files). This variable has no affect on the
processing of localedef input data; the POSIX locale is used
for this purpose, regardless of the value of this
variable.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The utility shall report all categories
successfully processed, in an unspecified format.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES The format of the created output is
unspecified. If the name operand does not contain a slash,
the existence of an output file for the locale is
unspecified.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION When the -u option is used, the
code_set_name option-argument shall be interpreted as an
implementation-defined name of a codeset to which the
ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard position constant values shall
be con- verted via an implementation-defined method. Both
the ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard position constant values
and other for- mats (decimal, hexadecimal, or octal) shall
be valid as encoding values within the charmap file. The
codeset represented by the implementation- defined name can
be any codeset that is supported by the implementa-
tion.</p>

<p>When conflicts occur between the charmap specification
of &lt;code_set_name&gt;, &lt;mb_cur_max&gt;, or
&lt;mb_cur_min&gt; and the implementation- defined
interpretation of these respective items for the codeset
repre- sented by the -u option-argument code_set_name, the
result is unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>When conflicts occur between the charmap encoding values
specified for symbolic names of characters of the portable
character set and the implementation-defined assignment of
character encoding values, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p>If a non-printable character in the charmap has a width
specified that is not -1, localedef shall generate a
warning.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 No errors occurred and the locales were successfully
created.</p>

<p>1 Warnings occurred and the locales were successfully
created.</p>

<p>2 The locale specification exceeded implementation
limits or the coded character set or sets used were not
supported by the implementation, and no locale was
created.</p>

<p>3 The capability to create new locales is not supported
by the implementation.</p>

<p>&gt;3 Warnings or errors occurred and no output was
created.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If an error is detected, no
permanent output shall be created.</p>

<p>If warnings occur, permanent output shall be created if
the -c option was specified. The following conditions shall
cause warning messages to be issued:</p>

<p>* If a symbolic name not found in the charmap file is
used for the descriptions of the LC_CTYPE or LC_COLLATE
categories (for other categories, this shall be an error
condition).</p>

<p>* If the number of operands to the order keyword exceeds
the {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX} limit.</p>

<p>* If optional keywords not supported by the
implementation are present in the source.</p>

<p>* If a non-printable character has a width specified
other than -1.</p>

<p>Other implementation-defined conditions may also cause
warnings.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The charmap definition is optional,
and is contained outside the locale definition. This allows
both completely self-defined source files, and generic
sources (applicable to more than one codeset). To aid
portabil- ity, all charmap definitions must use the same
symbolic names for the portable character set. As explained
in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 6.4, Character Set Description File, it is
implementation-defined whether or not users or applications
can pro- vide additional character set description files.
Therefore, the -f option might be operable only when an
implementation-defined charmap is named.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The output produced by the localedef utility
is implementation-defined. The name operand is used to
identify the specific locale. (As a conse- quence, although
several categories can be processed in one execution, only
categories belonging to the same locale can be
processed.)</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
