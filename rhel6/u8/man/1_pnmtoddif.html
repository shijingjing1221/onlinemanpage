<p>NAME pnmtoddif - Convert a PNM image to DDIF format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmtoddif [-resolution x y] [pnmfile
[ddiffile]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtoddif takes a PNM image and converts it into a DDIF
image file.</p>

<p>pnmtoddif writes PBM format (bitmap) data as a 1 bit
DDIF, PGM format data (grayscale) as an 8 bit grayscale
DDIF, and PPM format (color) data as an 8,8,8 bit color
DDIF. pnmtoddif writes any DDIF image file uncompressed. The
data plane organization is interleaved by pixel.</p>

<p>In addition to the number of pixels in the width and
height dimension, DDIF images also carry information about
the size that the image should have, that is, the physical
space that a pixel occupies. Netpbm images do not carry this
information, hence you have to supply it externally. The
default of 78 dpi has the beneficial property of not causing
a resize on most Digital Equipment Corporation color
monitors.</p>

<p>OPTIONS resolution x y The horizontal and vertical
resolution of the output image in dots per inch. Default is
78 dpi.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS pnmfile The filename for the image file in pnm
format. Default is to read from Standard Input.</p>

<p>ddiffile The filename for the image file to be created
in DDIF format. By default, pnmtoddif writes to Standard
Output.</p>
