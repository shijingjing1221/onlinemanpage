<p>NAME idmap_nss - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_nss Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_nss plugin provides a means to map
Unix users and groups to Windows accounts and obsoletes the
&quot;winbind trusted domains only&quot; smb.conf option.
This provides a simple means of ensuring that the SID for a
Unix user named jsmith is reported as the one assigned to
DOMAINjsmith which is necessary for reporting ACLs on files
and printers stored on a Samba member server.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example shows how to use idmap_nss to
check the local accounts for its own domain while using
allocation to create new mappings for trusted domains</p>

<p>[global] idmap config * : backend = tdb idmap config * :
range = 1000000-1999999</p>

<p>idmap config SAMBA : backend = nss idmap config SAMBA :
range = 1000-999999</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
