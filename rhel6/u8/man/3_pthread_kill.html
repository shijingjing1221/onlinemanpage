<p>PTHREAD_KILL(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_KILL(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_kill - send a signal to a thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_kill() function sends the signal
sig to thread, another thread in the same process as the
caller. The signal is asynchronously directed to thread.</p>

<p>If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking
is still per- formed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, pthread_kill() returns 0; on
error, it returns an error number, and no signal is
sent.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>NOTES Signal dispositions are process-wide: if a signal
handler is installed, the handler will be invoked in the
thread thread, but if the disposi- tion of the signal is
&quot;stop&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, or
&quot;terminate&quot;, this action will affect the whole
process.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2008 recommends that if an implementation
detects the use of a thread ID after the end of its
lifetime, pthread_kill() should return the error ESRCH. The
glibc implementation returns this error in the cases where
an invalid thread ID can be detected. But note also that
POSIX says that an attempt to use a thread ID whose lifetime
has ended produces undefined behavior, and an attempt to use
an invalid thread ID in a call to pthread_kill() can, for
example, cause a segmentation fault.</p>
