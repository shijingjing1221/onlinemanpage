<p>NAME gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_mem - API
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_mem(gnutls_certifi-
cate_credentials_t res, const gnutls_datum * p12blob,
gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type, const char * password);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res is a
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.</p>

<p>const gnutls_datum * p12blob the PKCS12 blob.</p>

<p>gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type is PEM or DER of the
pkcs12file.</p>

<p>const char * password optional password used to decrypt
PKCS12 file, bags and keys.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function sets a certificate/private key
pair and/or a CRL in the gnutls_certificate_credentials_t
structure. This function may be called more than once (in
case multiple keys/certificates exist for the server).</p>

<p>MAC ed PKCS12 files are supported. Encrypted PKCS12 bags
are supported. Encrypted PKCS8 private keys are supported.
However, only password based security, and the same password
for all operations, are sup- ported.</p>

<p>The private keys may be RSA PKCS1 or DSA private keys
encoded in the OpenSSL way.</p>

<p>PKCS12 file may contain many keys and/or certificates,
and there is no way to identify which key/certificate pair
you want. You should make sure the PKCS12 file only contain
one key/certificate pair and/or one CRL.</p>

<p>It is believed that the limitations of this function is
acceptable for most usage, and that any more flexibility
would introduce complexity that would make it harder to use
this functionality at all.</p>

<p>RETURNS GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error
code.</p>

<p>SINCE 2.8.0</p>
