<p>NAME ospam - An SGML/XML markup stream editor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ospam [-CeghilprRvx] [-alinktype]
[-Aarchitecture] [-bbctf] [-ccatalog_file] [-Ddirectory]
[-ffile] [-mmarkup_option] [-oentity_name] [-wwarning_type]
[sysid...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ospam (OpenSP Add Markup) is an SGML markup
stream editor implemented using the OpenSP parser. ospam
parses the SGML document contained in sysid and copies to
the standard output the portion of the document entity
containing the document instance, adding or changing markup
as specified by the -m options. The -p option can be used to
include the SGML declaration and prolog in the output. The
-o option can be used to output other entities. The -x
option can be used to expand entity references.</p>

<p>Part of an SGML System Conforming to International
Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language.
An SGML Extended Facilities system conforming to Annex A of
Internation Standard ISO/IEC 10744 -- Hypermedia/Time-based
Structuring Language.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-aname, --activate=name Make doctype or linktype name
active.</p>

<p>-Aarchitecture, --architecture=architecture Parse with
respect to architecture architecture.</p>

<p>-bbctf, --bctf=bctf Use bctf bctf for output.</p>

<p>-csysid, --catalog=sysid Use the catalog entry file
sysid.</p>

<p>-C, --catalogs This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-Ddirectory, --directory=directory Search directory for
files specified in system identifiers. This has the same
effect as in onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-e, --open-entities Describe open entities in error
messages.</p>

<p>-Emax_errors, --max-errors=max_errors Exit after
max_errors errors are encountered.</p>

<p>-ffile, --error-file=file Redirect errors to file. This
is useful mainly with shells that do not support redirection
of stderr.</p>

<p>-h, --hoist-omitted-tags Hoist omitted tags out from the
start of internal entities. If the text at the beginning of
an internal entity causes a tag to be implied, the tag will
usually be treated as being in that internal entity; this
option will instead cause it to be treated as being in the
entity that referenced the internal entity. This option
makes a difference in conjunction with -momittag or -x
-x.</p>

<p>--help Display a help text and exit.</p>

<p>-iname, --include=name This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-l, --lowercase Prefer lower-case. Added names that were
subject to upper-case substitution will be converted to
lower-case.</p>

<p>-mmarkup_option, --markup-option=markup_option Change
the markup in the output according to the value of
markup_option as follows:</p>

<p>omittag Add tags that were omitted using omitted tag
minimization. End tags that were omitted because the element
has a declared content of EMPTY or an explicit content
reference will not be added.</p>

<p>shortref Replace short references by named entity
references.</p>

<p>net Change null end-tags into unminimized end-tags, and
change net-enabling start-tags into unminimized
start-tags.</p>

<p>emptytag Change empty tags into unminimized tags.</p>

<p>unclosed Change unclosed tags into unminimized tags.</p>

<p>attname Add omitted attribute names and vis.</p>

<p>attvalue Add literal delimiters omitted from attribute
values.</p>

<p>attspec Add omitted attribute specifications.</p>

<p>current Add omitted attribute specifications for current
attributes. This option is implied by the attspec
option.</p>

<p>shorttag Equivalent to combination of net, emptytag,
unclosed, attname, attvalue and attspec options.</p>

<p>rank Add omitted rank suffixes.</p>

<p>reserved Put reserved names in upper-case.</p>

<p>ms Remove marked section declarations whose effective
status is IGNORE, and replace each marked section
declaration whose effective status is INCLUDE by its marked
section. In the document instance, empty comments will be
added before or after the marked section declaration to
ensure that ignored record ends remain ignored.</p>

<p>Multiple -m options are allowed.</p>

<p>-n, --error-numbers Show error numbers in error
messages.</p>

<p>-oname, --output-entity=name Output the general entity
name instead of the document entity. The output will
correspond to the first time that the entity is referenced
in content.</p>

<p>-p, --output-prolog Output the part of the document
entity containing the SGML declaration (if it was explicitly
present in the document entity) and the prolog before
anything else. If this option is specified two or more
times, then all entity references occurring between
declarations in the prolog will be expanded; this includes
the implicit reference to the entity containing the external
subset of the DTD, if there is one. Note that the SGML
declaration will not be included if it was specified by an
SGMLDECL entry in a catalog.</p>

<p>-r, --raw Don&acute;t perform any conversion on RSs and
REs when outputting the entity. The entity would typically
have the storage manager attribute records=asis.</p>

<p>-R, --restricted This as the same effect as in
onsgmls(1)</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version number.</p>

<p>-wtype, --warning=type Control warnings and errors
according to type. This has the same effect as in
onsgmls(1).</p>

<p>-x, --expand-references Expand references to entities
that are changed. If this option is specified two or more
times, then all references to entities that contain tags
will be expanded.</p>

<p>BUGS Omitted tags are added at the point where they are
implied by the SGML parser (except as modified by the -h
option); this is often not quite where they are wanted.</p>

<p>The case of general delimiters is not preserved.</p>

<p>Incorrect results may be produced if a variant concrete
syntax is used which is such that there are delimiters in
markup to be added that have a prefix that is a proper
suffix of some other delimiter.</p>

<p>If an entity reference in a default value uses the
default entity and an entity with that name is subsequently
defined and that default value is added to the document
instance, then the resulting document may not be equivalent
to the original document. ospam will give a warning when the
first two conditions are met.</p>
