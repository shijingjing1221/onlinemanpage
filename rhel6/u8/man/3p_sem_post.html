<p>SEM_POST(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SEM_POST(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sem_post - unlock a semaphore (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sem_post(sem_t *sem);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sem_post() function shall unlock the
semaphore referenced by sem by performing a semaphore unlock
operation on that semaphore.</p>

<p>If the semaphore value resulting from this operation is
positive, then no threads were blocked waiting for the
semaphore to become unlocked; the semaphore value is simply
incremented.</p>

<p>If the value of the semaphore resulting from this
operation is zero, then one of the threads blocked waiting
for the semaphore shall be allowed to return successfully
from its call to sem_wait(). If the Process Scheduling
option is supported, the thread to be unblocked shall be
chosen in a manner appropriate to the scheduling policies
and parameters in effect for the blocked threads. In the
case of the sched- ulers SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR, the
highest priority waiting thread shall be unblocked, and if
there is more than one highest priority thread blocked
waiting for the semaphore, then the highest priority thread
that has been waiting the longest shall be unblocked. If the
Process Scheduling option is not defined, the choice of a
thread to unblock is unspecified.</p>

<p>If the Process Sporadic Server option is supported, and
the scheduling policy is SCHED_SPORADIC, the semantics are
as per SCHED_FIFO above.</p>

<p>The sem_post() function shall be reentrant with respect
to signals and may be invoked from a signal-catching
function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the sem_post() function
shall return zero; otherwise, the function shall return -1
and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sem_post() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sem argument does not refer to a valid
semaphore.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sem_post() function is part of the
Semaphores option and need not be available on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
