<p>libcurl-multi(3) libcurl multi interface
libcurl-multi(3)</p>

<p>NAME libcurl-multi - how to use the multi interface</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is an overview on how to use the
libcurl multi interface in your C programs. There are
specific man pages for each function mentioned in here.
Theres also the libcurl-tutorial(3) man page for a complete
tutorial to programming with libcurl and the libcurl-easy(3)
man page for an overview of the libcurl easy interface.</p>

<p>All functions in the multi interface are prefixed with
curl_multi.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES The multi interface offers several abilities
that the easy interface doesnt. They are mainly:</p>

<p>1. Enable a &quot;pull&quot; interface. The application
that uses libcurl decides where and when to ask libcurl to
get/send data.</p>

<p>2. Enable multiple simultaneous transfers in the same
thread without making it complicated for the
application.</p>

<p>3. Enable the application to wait for action on its own
file descrip- tors and curls file descriptors simultaneous
easily.</p>

<p>ONE MULTI HANDLE MANY EASY HANDLES To use the multi
interface, you must first create a multi handle with
curl_multi_init(3). This handle is then used as input to all
further curl_multi_* functions.</p>

<p>Each single transfer is built up with an easy handle.
You must create them, and setup the appropriate options for
each easy handle, as out- lined in the libcurl(3) man page,
using curl_easy_setopt(3).</p>

<p>When the easy handle is setup for a transfer, then
instead of using curl_easy_perform(3) (as when using the
easy interface for transfers), you should instead add the
easy handle to the multi handle using
curl_multi_add_handle(3). The multi handle is sometimes
referred to as a &acute;multi stack&acute; because of the
fact that it may hold a large amount of easy handles.</p>

<p>Should you change your mind, the easy handle is again
removed from the multi stack using
curl_multi_remove_handle(3). Once removed from the multi
handle, you can again use other easy interface functions
like curl_easy_perform(3) on the handle or whatever you
think is necessary.</p>

<p>Adding the easy handle to the multi handle does not
start the transfer. Remember that one of the main ideas with
this interface is to let your application drive. You drive
the transfers by invoking curl_multi_per- form(3). libcurl
will then transfer data if there is anything available to
transfer. It ll use the callbacks and everything else you
have setup in the individual easy handles. Itll transfer
data on all current transfers in the multi stack that are
ready to transfer anything. It may be all, it may be
none.</p>

<p>Your application can acquire knowledge from libcurl when
it would like to get invoked to transfer data, so that you
dont have to busy-loop and call that curl_multi_perform(3)
like crazy. curl_multi_fdset(3) offers an interface using
which you can extract fd_sets from libcurl to use in
select() or poll() calls in order to get to know when the
trans- fers in the multi stack might need attention. This
also makes it very easy for your program to wait for input
on your own private file descriptors at the same time or
perhaps timeout every now and then, should you want
that.</p>

<p>A little note here about the return codes from the multi
functions, and especially the curl_multi_perform(3): if you
receive CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM, this basically means that
you should call curl_multi_perform(3) again, before you
select() on more actions. You dont have to do it
immediately, but the return code means that libcurl may have
more data available to return or that there may be more data
to send off before it is &quot;satisfied&quot;.</p>

<p>curl_multi_perform(3) stores the number of still running
transfers in one of its input arguments, and by reading that
you can figure out when all the transfers in the multi
handles are done. done does not mean successful. One or more
of the transfers may have failed. Tracking when this number
changes, you know when one or more transfers are done.</p>

<p>To get information about completed transfers, to figure
out success or not and similar, curl_multi_info_read(3)
should be called. It can return a message about a current or
previous transfer. Repeated invokes of the function get more
messages until the message queue is empty. The information
you receive there includes an easy handle pointer which you
may use to identify which easy handle the information
regards.</p>

<p>When a single transfer is completed, the easy handle is
still left added to the multi stack. You need to first
remove the easy handle with curl_multi_remove_handle(3) and
then close it with curl_easy_cleanup(3), or possibly set new
options to it and add it again with curl_multi_add_handle(3)
to start another transfer.</p>

<p>When all transfers in the multi stack are done, cleanup
the multi han- dle with curl_multi_cleanup(3). Be careful
and please note that you MUST invoke separate
curl_easy_cleanup(3) calls on every single easy handle to
clean them up properly.</p>

<p>If you want to re-use an easy handle that was added to
the multi handle for transfer, you must first remove it from
the multi stack and then re-add it again (possibly after
having altered some options at your own choice).</p>

<p>MULTI_SOCKET Since 7.16.0, the
curl_multi_socket_action(3) function offers a way for
applications to not only avoid being forced to use select(),
but it also offers a much more high-performance API that
will make a signifi- cant difference for applications using
large numbers of simultaneous connections.</p>

<p>curl_multi_socket_action(3) is then used instead of
curl_multi_per- form(3).</p>

<p>BLOCKING A few areas in the code are still using
blocking code, even when used from the multi interface.
While we certainly want and intend for these to get fixed in
the future, you should be aware of the following cur- rent
restrictions:</p>

<p>- Name resolves on non-windows unless c-ares is used -
GnuTLS SSL connections - Active FTP connections - HTTP proxy
CONNECT operations - SOCKS proxy handshakes - TFTP transfers
- file:// transfers - TELNET transfers</p>
