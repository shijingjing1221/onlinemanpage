<p>PTHREAD_SELF(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SELF(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_self - obtain ID of the calling thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>pthread_t pthread_self(void);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_self() function returns the ID
of the calling thread. This is the same value that is
returned in *thread in the pthread_create(3) call that
created this thread.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function always succeeds, returning
the calling threads ID.</p>

<p>ERRORS This function always succeeds.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX.1 allows an implementation wide freedom in
choosing the type used to represent a thread ID; for
example, representation using either an arithmetic type or a
structure is permitted. Therefore, variables of type
pthread_t cant portably be compared using the C equality
operator (==); use pthread_equal(3) instead.</p>

<p>Thread identifiers should be considered opaque: any
attempt to use a thread ID other than in pthreads calls is
non-portable and can lead to unspecified results.</p>

<p>Thread IDs are only guaranteed to be unique within a
process. A thread ID may be reused after a terminated thread
has been joined, or a detached thread has terminated.</p>

<p>The thread ID returned by pthread_self() is not the same
thing as the kernel thread ID returned by a call to
gettid(2).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pthread_create(3), pthread_equal(3),
pthreads(7)</p>
