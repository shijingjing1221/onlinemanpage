<p>NAME pppstats - print PPP statistics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pppstats [ -a ] [ -v ] [ -r ] [ -z ] [ -c
&lt;count&gt; ] [ -w &lt;secs&gt; ] [ interface ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pppstats utility reports PPP-related
statistics at regular inter- vals for the specified PPP
interface. If the interface is unspecified, it will default
to ppp0. The display is split horizontally into input and
output sections containing columns of statistics describing
the properties and volume of packets received and
transmitted by the inter- face.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-a Display absolute values rather than deltas. With this
option, all reports show statistics for the time since the
link was ini- tiated. Without this option, the second and
subsequent reports show statistics for the time since the
last report.</p>

<p>-c count Repeat the display count times. If this option
is not speci- fied, the default repeat count is 1 if the -w
option is not specified, otherwise infinity.</p>

<p>-r Display additional statistics summarizing the
compression ratio achieved by the packet compression
algorithm in use.</p>

<p>-v Display additional statistics relating to the
performance of the Van Jacobson TCP header compression
algorithm.</p>

<p>-w wait Pause wait seconds between each display. If this
option is not specified, the default interval is 5
seconds.</p>

<p>-z Instead of the standard display, show statistics
indicating the performance of the packet compression
algorithm in use.</p>

<p>The following fields are printed on the input side when
the -z option is not used:</p>

<p>IN The total number of bytes received by this
interface.</p>

<p>PACK The total number of packets received by this
interface.</p>

<p>VJCOMP The number of header-compressed TCP packets
received by this interface.</p>

<p>VJUNC The number of header-uncompressed TCP packets
received by this interface. Not reported when the -r option
is specified.</p>

<p>VJERR The number of corrupted or bogus header-compressed
TCP packets received by this interface. Not reported when
the -r option is specified.</p>

<p>VJTOSS The number of VJ header-compressed TCP packets
dropped on recep- tion by this interface because of
preceding errors. Only reported when the -v option is
specified.</p>

<p>NON-VJ The total number of non-TCP packets received by
this interface. Only reported when the -v option is
specified.</p>

<p>RATIO The compression ratio achieved for received
packets by the packet compression scheme in use, defined as
the uncompressed size divided by the compressed size. Only
reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p>UBYTE The total number of bytes received, after
decompression of com- pressed packets. Only reported when
the -r option is specified.</p>

<p>The following fields are printed on the output side:</p>

<p>OUT The total number of bytes transmitted from this
interface.</p>

<p>PACK The total number of packets transmitted from this
interface.</p>

<p>VJCOMP The number of TCP packets transmitted from this
interface with VJ-compressed TCP headers.</p>

<p>VJUNC The number of TCP packets transmitted from this
interface with VJ-uncompressed TCP headers. Not reported
when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p>NON-VJ The total number of non-TCP packets transmitted
from this inter- face. Not reported when the -r option is
specified.</p>

<p>VJSRCH The number of searches for the cached header
entry for a VJ header compressed TCP packet. Only reported
when the -v option is specified.</p>

<p>VJMISS The number of failed searches for the cached
header entry for a VJ header compressed TCP packet. Only
reported when the -v option is specified.</p>

<p>RATIO The compression ratio achieved for transmitted
packets by the packet compression scheme in use, defined as
the size before compression divided by the compressed size.
Only reported when the -r option is specified.</p>

<p>UBYTE The total number of bytes to be transmitted,
before packet com- pression is applied. Only reported when
the -r option is speci- fied.</p>

<p>When the -z option is specified, instead displays the
following fields, relating to the packet compression
algorithm currently in use. If packet compression is not in
use, these fields will all display zeroes. The fields
displayed on the input side are:</p>

<p>COMPRESSED BYTE The number of bytes of compressed
packets received.</p>

<p>COMPRESSED PACK The number of compressed packets
received.</p>

<p>INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE The number of bytes of
incompressible packets (that is, those which were
transmitted in uncompressed form) received.</p>

<p>INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK The number of incompressible packets
received.</p>

<p>COMP RATIO The recent compression ratio for incoming
packets, defined as the uncompressed size divided by the
compressed size (including both compressible and
incompressible packets).</p>

<p>The fields displayed on the output side are:</p>

<p>COMPRESSED BYTE The number of bytes of compressed
packets transmitted.</p>

<p>COMPRESSED PACK The number of compressed packets
transmitted.</p>

<p>INCOMPRESSIBLE BYTE The number of bytes of
incompressible packets transmitted (that is, those which
were transmitted in uncompressed form).</p>

<p>INCOMPRESSIBLE PACK The number of incompressible packets
transmitted.</p>

<p>COMP RATIO The recent compression ratio for outgoing
packets.</p>
