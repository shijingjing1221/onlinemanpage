<p>NAME blk_cloned_rq_check_limits - Helper function to
check a cloned request for new the queue limits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int blk_cloned_rq_check_limits(struct
request_queue * q, struct request * rq);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q the queue</p>

<p>rq the request being checked</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rq may have been made based on weaker
limitations of upper-level queues in request stacking
drivers, and it may violate the limitation of q. Since the
block layer and the underlying device driver trust rq after
it is inserted to q, it should be checked against q before
the insertion using this generic function.</p>

<p>Request stacking drivers like request-based dm may
change the queue limits when retrying requests on other
queues. Those requests need to be checked against the new
queue limits again during dispatch.</p>
