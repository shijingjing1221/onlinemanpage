<p>NAME ltrace - A library call tracer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ltrace [-CdfhiLrStttV] [-a column] [-e expr]
[-l filename] [-n nr] [-o filename] [-p pid] ... [-s
strsize] [-u username] [-X extern] [-x extern] ...
[--align=column] [--debug] [--demangle] [--help]
[--indent=nr] [--library=filename] [--output=filename]
[--version] [command [arg ...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ltrace is a program that simply runs the
specified command until it exits. It intercepts and records
the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed
process and the signals which are received by that process.
It can also intercept and print the system calls exe- cuted
by the program.</p>

<p>Its use is very similar to strace(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --align column Align return values in a
specific column (default column is 5/8 of screen width).</p>

<p>-c Count time and calls for each library call and report
a summary on program exit.</p>

<p>-C, --demangle Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names
into user-level names. Besides removing any initial
underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function
names readable.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Increase the debugging level. Use more (ie.
-dd ) for greater debugging information.</p>

<p>--dl When a dlopened library is mapped in the process
address space, put breakpoints to all symbols in the dynamic
symbol table of that library.</p>

<p>-e expr A qualifying expression which modifies which
events to trace. The format of the expression is:
[!]value1[,value2]... where the values are the functions to
trace. Using an exclama- tion mark negates the set of
values. For example -e printf means to trace only the printf
library call. By contrast, -e !printf means to trace every
library call except printf.</p>

<p>Note that some shells use the exclamation point for
history expansion; even inside quoted arguments. If so, you
must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.</p>

<p>-f Trace child processes as they are created by
currently traced processes as a result of the fork(2) or
clone(2) system calls. The new process is attached as soon
as its pid is known.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show a summary of the options to ltrace and
exit.</p>

<p>-i Print the instruction pointer at the time of the
library call.</p>

<p>-l, --library filename Display only the symbols included
in the library filename. Up to 20 library names can be
specified with several instances of this option.</p>

<p>-L DONT display library calls (use it with the -S
option).</p>

<p>-n, --indent nr Indent trace output by nr number of
spaces for each new nested call. Using this option makes the
program flow visualization easy to follow.</p>

<p>-o, --output filename Write the trace output to the file
filename rather than to stderr.</p>

<p>-p pid Attach to the process with the process ID pid and
begin tracing.</p>

<p>-r Print a relative timestamp with each line of the
trace. This records the time difference between the
beginning of successive lines.</p>

<p>-s strsize Specify the maximum string size to print (the
default is 32).</p>

<p>-S Display system calls as well as library calls</p>

<p>-t Prefix each line of the trace with the time of
day.</p>

<p>-tt If given twice, the time printed will include the
microseconds.</p>

<p>-ttt If given thrice, the time printed will include the
microseconds and the leading portion will be printed as the
number of seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>-T Show the time spent inside each call. This records
the time difference between the beginning and the end of
each call.</p>

<p>-u username Run command with the userid, groupid and
supplementary groups of username. This option is only useful
when running as root and enables the correct execution of
setuid and/or setgid binaries.</p>

<p>-X extern Some architectures need to know where to set a
breakpoint that will be hit after the dynamic linker has
run. If this flag is used, then the breakpoint is set at
extern, which must be an external function. By default,
_start is used. NOTE: this flag is only available on the
architectures that need it.</p>

<p>-x extern Trace the external function extern. This
option may be repeated.</p>

<p>-V, --version Show the version number of ltrace and
exit.</p>

<p>BUGS It has most of the bugs stated in strace(1).</p>

<p>Manual page and documentation are not very
up-to-date.</p>

<p>Option -f sometimes fails to trace some children.</p>

<p>It only works on Linux and in a small subset of
architectures.</p>

<p>If you like to report a bug, send a notice to the
author, or use the reportbug(1) program if you are under the
Debian GNU/Linux distribu- tion.</p>

<p>~/.ltrace.conf Personal config file, overrides
/etc/ltrace.conf</p>
