<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSCOPE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSCOPE(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_setscope, pthread_attr_getscope -
set/get contention scope attribute in thread attributes
object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_setscope(pthread_attr_t *attr, int
scope); int pthread_attr_getscope(pthread_attr_t *attr, int
*scope);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_setscope() function sets
the contention scope attribute of the thread attributes
object referred to by attr to the value specified in scope.
The contention scope attribute defines the set of threads
against which a thread competes for resources such as the
CPU. POSIX.1-2001 specifies two possible values for
scope:</p>

<p>PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM The thread competes for resources
with all other threads in all processes on the system that
are in the same scheduling alloca- tion domain (a group of
one or more processors). PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM threads are
scheduled relative to one another according to their
scheduling policy and priority.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS The thread competes for resources
with all other threads in the same process that were also
created with the PTHREAD_SCOPE_PRO- CESS contention scope.
PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS threads are sched- uled relative to
other threads in the process according to their scheduling
policy and priority. POSIX.1-2001 leaves it unspeci- fied
how these threads contend with other threads in other pro-
cess on the system or with other threads in the same process
that were created with the PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM contention
scope.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 only requires that an implementation
support one of these contention scopes, but permits both to
be supported. Linux supports PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM, but not
PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getscope() function returns the
contention scope attribute of the thread attributes object
referred to by attr in the buffer pointed to by scope.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS pthread_attr_setscope() can fail with the
following errors:</p>

<p>EINVAL An invalid value was specified in scope.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP scope specified the value PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS,
which is not supported on Linux.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES The PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM contention scope
typically indicates that a userspace thread is bound
directly to a single kernel-scheduling entity. This is the
case on Linux for the obsolete LinuxThreads imple- mentation
and the modern NPTL implementation, which are both 1:1
threading implementations.</p>

<p>POSIX.1-2001 specifies that the default contention scope
is implementa- tion-defined.</p>
