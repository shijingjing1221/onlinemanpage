IPSEC_TRAP_COUNT(5)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_trap_count - KLIPS statistic on number of
ACQUIREs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cat /proc/net/ipsec/stats/trap_count</p>

<p>OBSOLETE Note that trap_count is only supported on the
classic KLIPS stack. It is not supported on any other stack
and will be completely removed in future versions. A
replacement command still needs to be designed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /proc/net/ipsec/stats/trap_count is a
read-only file. It contains a hexadecimal number which
records the number of attempts to send PF_ACQUIRE messages.
Only those recorded by trap_sendcount were actually
successfully passed to userland. Note that the userland may
still have lost them on its own.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/ipsec/stats/trap_count</p>
