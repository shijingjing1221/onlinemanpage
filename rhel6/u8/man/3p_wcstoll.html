<p>WCSTOL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSTOL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcstol, wcstoll - convert a wide-character string
to a long integer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>long wcstol(const wchar_t *restrict nptr, wchar_t
**restrict endptr, int base); long long wcstoll(const
wchar_t *restrict nptr, wchar_t **restrict endptr, int
base);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall convert the initial
portion of the wide-character string pointed to by nptr to
long, long long, unsigned long, and unsigned long long
representation, respectively. First, they shall decompose
the input string into three parts:</p>

<p>1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space
wide-character codes (as specified by iswspace())</p>

<p>2. A subject sequence interpreted as an integer
represented in some radix determined by the value of
base</p>

<p>3. A final wide-character string of one or more
unrecognized wide- character codes, including the
terminating null wide-character code of the input
wide-character string</p>

<p>Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence
to an integer, and return the result.</p>

<p>If base is 0, the expected form of the subject sequence
is that of a decimal constant, octal constant, or
hexadecimal constant, any of which may be preceded by
a+or-sign. A decimal constant begins with a non-zero digit,
and consists of a sequence of decimal digits. An octal
constant consists of the prefix0optionally followed by a
sequence of the digits0to7only. A hexadecimal constant
consists of the prefix 0x or 0X followed by a sequence of
the decimal digits and let- ters a(orA) tof(orF) with values
10 to 15 respectively.</p>

<p>If the value of base is between 2 and 36, the expected
form of the sub- ject sequence is a sequence of letters and
digits representing an inte- ger with the radix specified by
base, optionally preceded by a + or - sign, but not
including an integer suffix. The letters froma(or A)
toz(orZ) inclusive are ascribed the values 10 to 35; only
letters whose ascribed values are less than that of base
shall be per- mitted. If the value of base is 16, the
wide-character code representa- tions of 0x or 0X may
optionally precede the sequence of letters and digits,
following the sign if present.</p>

<p>The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
subsequence of the input wide-character string, starting
with the first non-white- space wide-character code that is
of the expected form. The subject sequence contains no
wide-character codes if the input wide-character string is
empty or consists entirely of white-space wide-character
code, or if the first non-white-space wide-character code is
other than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the expected form and base
is 0, the sequence of wide-character codes starting with the
first digit shall be interpreted as an integer constant. If
the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of
base is between 2 and 36, it shall be used as the base for
conversion, ascribing to each letter its value as given
above. If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the
value resulting from the conversion shall be negated. A
pointer to the final wide-character string shall be stored
in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is
not a null pointer.</p>

<p>In other than the C or POSIX locales, other
implementation-defined subject sequences may be
accepted.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the
expected form, no conversion shall be performed; the value
of nptr shall be stored in the object pointed to by endptr,
provided that endptr is not a null pointer.</p>

<p>These functions shall not change the setting of errno if
successful.</p>

<p>Since 0, {LONG_MIN} or {LLONG_MIN} and {LONG_MAX} or
{LLONG_MAX} are returned on error and are also valid returns
on success, an application wishing to check for error
situations should set errno to 0, then call wcstol() or
wcstoll(), then check errno.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the converted value, if any. If no conversion
could be performed, 0 shall be returned and errno may be set
to indicate the error. If the correct value is outside the
range of representable values, {LONG_MIN}, {LONG_MAX},
{LLONG_MIN}, or {LLONG_MAX} shall be returned (according to
the sign of the value), and errno set to [ERANGE].</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of base is not supported.</p>

<p>ERANGE The value to be returned is not
representable.</p>

<p>These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL No conversion could be performed.</p>
