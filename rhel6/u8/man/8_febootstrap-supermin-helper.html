<p>NAME febootstrap-supermin-helper - Reconstruct initramfs
from supermin appliance.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS febootstrap-supermin-helper supermin.img
hostfiles.txt host_cpu kernel initrd
febootstrap-supermin-helper input [...] host_cpu kernel
initrd</p>

<p>febootstrap-supermin-helper -f ext2 input [...] host_cpu
kernel initrd appliance</p>

<p>febootstrap-supermin-helper -f checksum input [...]
host_cpu</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION febootstrap-supermin-helper reconstructs a
bootable kernel and initramfs from a supermin appliance.
First you should be familiar with febootstrap(8).</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Of the required parameters, the first few are
input files, and the last two or three are output files.</p>

<p>&quot;supermin.img&quot; and &quot;hostfiles.txt&quot;
are the input files which describe the supermin appliance.
(You can also use a directory name here which is searched
for files).</p>

<p>&quot;host_cpu&quot; should be the host CPU, eg.
&quot;x86_64&quot; or &quot;i686&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;kernel&quot;, &quot;initrd&quot; and
&quot;appliance&quot; are the temporary output files that
this script produces. These output files are meant to be
used just for booting the appliance, and should be deleted
straight afterwards. The extra &quot;appliance&quot;
parameter is only required when the format is
&quot;ext2&quot;. None of these parameters are needed for
the checksum output &quot;-f checksum&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f fmt --format fmt Select the output format for
the appliance. Possible formats are:</p>

<p>cpio A Linux initramfs. This is the default.</p>

<p>In this case you have to supply names for the
&quot;kernel&quot; and &quot;initrd&quot;, where the
&quot;initrd&quot; is the appliance.</p>

<p>ext2 An ext2 filesystem.</p>

<p>In this case you have to supply names for the
&quot;kernel&quot;, a small &quot;initrd&quot; which is used
just to locate the appliance, and the &quot;appliance&quot;
(the ext2 filesystem).</p>

<p>checksum Output a checksum.</p>

<p>This prints a checksum which only changes when one of
the input files changes.</p>

<p>You can use this in order to cache the output of a
previous run of this program: computing the checksum is much
quicker than building an appliance, and you only need to
invalidate the cache (and consequently rebuild the
appliance) when the checksum changes. Note that the host_cpu
and the UID of the current user are included in the
checksum.</p>

<p>--copy-kernel Copy the kernel instead of symlinking to
the kernel in &quot;/boot&quot;.</p>

<p>This is fractionally slower, but is necessary if you
want to change the permissions or SELinux label on the
kernel.</p>

<p>-k file --kmods file If this option is specified, then
&quot;file&quot; should be a list of wildcards matching
kernel module names, eg:</p>

<p>virtio*.ko scsi*.ko piix.ko</p>

<p>In this case, only kernel modules matching those
wildcards will be included in the output appliance. Note:
You must resolve any dependencies yourself as this does not
pull in dependent modules automatically.</p>

<p>If this option is not specified, then every kernel
module from the host will be included. This is safer, but
can produce rather large appliances which need a lot more
memory to boot.</p>

<p>-u user --user user -g group --group group Run
febootstrap-supermin-helper as an alternate user and/or
group. &quot;user&quot; and &quot;group&quot; can be
specified as either a name, which will be resolved using the
system name service, or a uid/gid. Use of these options
requires root privileges.</p>

<p>Use of these options is required if running
febootstrap-supermin- helper as root with the effective
uid/gid set to non-root. Bash will reset the effective
uid/gid to the real uid/gid when invoked. As
febootstrap-supermin-helper uses bash in parts, this will
result in the creation of an appliance with a mixture of
ownerships.</p>

<p>SPEED In libguestfs, on a mid-range Intel-based PC, we
reconstruct the initramfs using this script in around 1/5th
of a second (assuming a &quot;hot cache&quot; - its rather
slower when run the first time on a cold cache).</p>

<p>Some tips to improve performance:</p>

<p>&middot; Use a kernel module whitelist (the
&quot;--kmods&quot; option), and only list the kernel
modules you really need.</p>

<p>&middot; Minimize the appliance, removing as much
extraneous junk as possible.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FEBOOTSTRAP_KERNEL If this
environment variable is set, then automatic selection of the
kernel is bypassed and this kernel is used.</p>

<p>The environment variable should point to a kernel file,
eg. &quot;/boot/vmlinuz-3.0.x86_64&quot;</p>

<p>The corresponding module path is guessed from the kernel
name, but you can override that by setting
&quot;FEBOOTSTRAP_MODULES&quot;.</p>

<p>FEBOOTSTRAP_MODULES If &quot;FEBOOTSTRAP_KERNEL&quot;
and &quot;FEBOOTSTRAP_MODULES&quot; are both set, then
automatic selection of the kernel is bypassed and the kernel
and module path are set to these values.</p>

<p>The environment variable should point to a module
directory, eg. &quot;/lib/modules/3.0.x86_64/&quot;</p>

<p>This has no effect if &quot;FEBOOTSTRAP_KERNEL&quot; is
not set.</p>
