<p>NAME pstops - shuffle pages in a PostScript file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pstops [ -q ] [ -b ] [ -wwidth ] [ -hheight ] [
-ppaper ] [ -dlwidth ] pagespecs [ infile [ outfile ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Pstops rearranges pages from a PostScript
document, creating a new PostScript file. The input
PostScript file should follow the Adobe Document Structuring
Conventions. Pstops can be used to perform a large number of
arbitrary re-arrangements of Documents, including arranging
for printing 2-up, 4-up, booklets, reversing, selecting
front or back sides of documents, scaling, etc.</p>

<p>pagespecs follow the syntax:</p>

<p>pagespecs = [modulo:]specs</p>

<p>specs = spec[+specs][,specs]</p>

<p>spec = [-]pageno[L][R][U][@scale][(xoff,yoff)]</p>

<p>modulo is the number of pages in each block. The value
of modulo should be greater than 0; the default value is 1.
specs are the page specifi- cations for the pages in each
block. The value of the pageno in each spec should be
between 0 (for the first page in the block) and modulo-1
(for the last page in each block) inclusive. The optional
dimensions xoff and yoff shift the page by the specified
amount. xoff and yoff are in PostScript s points, but may be
followed by the units cm or in to convert to centimetres or
inches, or the flag w or h to specify as a multiple of the
width or height. The optional parameters L, R, and U rotate
the page left, right, or upside-down. The optional scale
param- eter scales the page by the fraction specified. If
the optional minus sign is specified, the page is relative
to the end of the document, instead of the start.</p>

<p>If page specs are separated by + the pages will be
merged into one page; if they are separated by they will be
on separate pages. If there is only one page specification,
with pageno zero, the pageno may be omitted.</p>

<p>The shift, rotation, and scaling are performed in that
order regardless of which order they appear on the command
line.</p>

<p>The -w option gives the width which is used by the w
dimension speci- fier, and the -h option gives the height
which is used by the h dimen- sion specifier. These
dimensions are also used (after scaling) to set the clipping
path for each page. The -p option can be used as an
alternative, to set the paper size to a3, a4, a5, b5,
letter, legal, tabloid, statement, executive, folio, quarto,
10x14 or _glibc, where latter one means the format of the
current locale. The default paper size is _glibc.</p>

<p>The -b option prevents any bind operators in the
PostScript prolog from binding. This may be needed in cases
where complex multi-page re- arrangements are being
done.</p>

<p>The -d option draws a line around the border of each
page, of the spec- ified width. If the lwidth parameter is
omitted, a default linewidth of 1 point is assumed. The
linewidth is relative to the original page dimensions, i.e.
it is scaled up or down with the rest of the page.</p>

<p>Pstops normally prints the page numbers of the pages
re-arranged; the -q option suppresses this.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This section contains some sample
re-arrangements. To put two pages on one sheet (of A4
paper), the pagespec to use is:</p>

<p>2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)</p>

<p>To select all of the odd pages in reverse order,
use:</p>

<p>2:-0</p>

<p>To re-arrange pages for printing 2-up booklets, use</p>

<p>4:-3L@.7(21cm,0)+0L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)</p>

<p>for the front sides, and</p>

<p>4:1L@.7(21cm,0)+-2L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)</p>

<p>for the reverse sides (or join them with a comma for
duplex printing).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LC_ALL, LC_PAPER These variables
are specifying the papertype when used paper is _glibc. For
details see the locale(7) manpage.</p>
