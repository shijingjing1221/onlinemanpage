<p>LASTCOMM(1) LASTCOMM(1)</p>

<p>NAME lastcomm - print out information about previously
executed commands.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lastcomm [ command-name ... ] [ user-name ... ]
[ terminal-name ... ] [ --strict-match ] [ -f filename |
--file filename ] [ --user name ] [ --command name ] [ --tty
name ] [ --debug ] [ -pid ] [ -V | --version ] [ -h | --help
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lastcomm prints out information about
previously executed commands. If no arguments are specified,
lastcomm will print info about all of the commands in acct
(the record file). If called with one or more of com-
mand-name, user-name, or terminal-name, only records
containing those items will be displayed. For example, to
find out which users used command a.out and which users were
logged into tty0, type: lastcomm a.out tty0</p>

<p>This will print any entry for which a.out or tty0
matches in any of the records fields (command, name, or
terminal). If you want to find only items that match *all*
of the arguments on the command line, you must use the
-strict-match option. For example, to list all of the
executions of command a.out by user root on terminal tty0,
type: lastcomm --strict-match a.out root tty0</p>

<p>The order of the arguments is not important.</p>

<p>For each entry the following information is printed: +
command name of the process + flags, as recorded by the
system accounting routines: S -- command executed by
super-user F -- command executed after a fork but without a
following exec C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode
(VAX only) D -- command terminated with the generation of a
core file X -- command was terminated with the signal
SIGTERM + the name of the user who ran the process + time
the process started</p>

<p>OPTIONS --strict-match Print only entries that match
*all* of the arguments on the com- mand line.</p>

<p>--user name List records for user with name. This is
useful if youre try- ing to match a username that happens to
be the same as a command (e.g., ed ).</p>

<p>--command name List records for command name.</p>

<p>--tty name List records for tty name.</p>

<p>-f filename, --file filename Read from the file filename
instead of acct</p>

<p>--pid add pid of the process and pid of the process
parent to the out- put (pid is the last but one and parent
pid the last column). These values are shown only when they
are generated by acct function (depends on the version of
kernel)</p>

<p>--debug Print verbose internal information.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the version number of lastcomm.</p>

<p>-h, --help Prints the usage string and default locations
of system files to standard output and exits.</p>

<p>FILES acct The system wide process accounting file. See
acct(5) (or pac- ct(5)) for further details.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The GNU accounting utilities were written by Noel
Cragg &lt;noel@gnu.ai.mit.edu&gt;. The man page was adapted
from the accounting texinfo page by Susan Kleinmann
