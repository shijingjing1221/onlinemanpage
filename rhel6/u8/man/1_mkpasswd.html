<p>MKPASSWD(1) MKPASSWD(1)</p>

<p>NAME mkpasswd - generate new password, optionally apply
it to a user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mkpasswd [ args ] [ user ]</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION mkpasswd generates passwords and can apply
them automatically to users. mkpasswd is based on the code
from Chapter 23 of the O Reilly book &quot;Exploring
Expect&quot;.</p>

<p>USAGE With no arguments, mkpasswd returns a new
password.</p>

<p>mkpasswd</p>

<p>With a user name, mkpasswd assigns a new password to the
user.</p>

<p>mkpasswd don</p>

<p>The passwords are randomly generated according to the
flags below.</p>

<p>FLAGS The -l flag defines the length of the password.
The default is 9. The following example creates a 20
character password.</p>

<p>mkpasswd -l 20</p>

<p>The -d flag defines the minimum number of digits that
must be in the password. The default is 2. The following
example creates a password with at least 3 digits.</p>

<p>mkpasswd -d 3</p>

<p>The -c flag defines the minimum number of lowercase
alphabetic charac- ters that must be in the password. The
default is 2.</p>

<p>The -C flag defines the minimum number of uppercase
alphabetic charac- ters that must be in the password. The
default is 2.</p>

<p>The -s flag defines the minimum number of special
characters that must be in the password. The default is
1.</p>

<p>The -p flag names a program to set the password. By
default, /etc/yppasswd is used if present, otherwise
/bin/passwd is used.</p>

<p>The -2 flag causes characters to be chosen so that they
alternate between right and left hands (qwerty-style),
making it harder for any- one watching passwords being
entered. This can also make it easier for a
password-guessing program.</p>

<p>The -v flag causes the password-setting interaction to
be visible. By default, it is suppressed.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example creates a 15-character
password that contains at least 3 digits and 5 uppercase
characters.</p>

<p>mkpasswd -l 15 -d 3 -C 5</p>

<p>mkpasswd is in the public domain. NIST and I would
appreciate credit if this program or parts of it are
used.</p>
