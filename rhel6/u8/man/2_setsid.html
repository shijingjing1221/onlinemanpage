<p>SETSID(2) Linux Programmer s Manual SETSID(2)</p>

<p>NAME setsid - creates a session and sets the process
group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>pid_t setsid(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setsid() creates a new session if the
calling process is not a process group leader. The calling
process is the leader of the new session, the process group
leader of the new process group, and has no control- ling
tty. The process group ID and session ID of the calling
process are set to the PID of the calling process. The
calling process will be the only process in this new process
group and in this new session.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the (new) session ID of the
calling process is returned. On error, (pid_t) -1 is
returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EPERM. The process group ID of any process equals
the PID of the call- ing process. Thus, in particular,
setsid() fails if the calling process is already a process
group leader.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES A child created via fork(2) inherits its parent s
session ID. The ses- sion ID is preserved across an
execve(2).</p>

<p>A process group leader is a process with process group
ID equal to its PID. In order to be sure that setsid() will
succeed, fork(2) and _exit(2), and have the child do
setsid().</p>
