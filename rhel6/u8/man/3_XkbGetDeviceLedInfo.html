<p>XkbGetDeviceLedInfo(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbGetDeviceLedInfo(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbGetDeviceLedInfo - Query the indicator names,
maps, and state asso- ciated with an LED feedback of an
input extension device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbGetDeviceLedInfo (Display *dpy,
XkbDeviceInfoPtr device_info, unsigned int led_class,
unsigned int led_id, unsigned int which);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - dpy connection to X server</p>

<p>- device_info structure to update with results</p>

<p>- led_class LED feedback class assigned by input
extension</p>

<p>- led_id LED feedback ID assigned by input extension</p>

<p>- which mask indicating desired information</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbGetDeviceLedInfo queries the server for
the desired LED information for the feedback specified by
led_class and led_id for the X input extension device
indicated by device_spec-&gt;device_info and waits for a
reply. If successful, XkbGetDeviceLedInfo backfills the
relevant fields of device_info as determined by which with
the results and returns Suc- cess. Valid values for which
are the inclusive OR of any of XkbXI_Indi- catorNamesMask,
XkbXI_IndicatorMapsMask, and XkbXI_IndicatorStateMask.</p>

<p>The fields of device_info that are filled in when this
request succeeds are name, type, supported, and unsupported,
and portions of the leds structure corresponding to
led_class and led_id as indicated by the bits set in which.
The device_info-&gt;leds vector is allocated if neces- sary
and sz_leds and num_leds filled in. The led_class, led_id
and phys_indicators fields of the device_info-&gt;leds entry
corresponding to led_class and led_id are always filled
in.</p>

<p>If which contains XkbXI_IndicatorNamesMask, the
names_present and names fields of the device_info-&gt;leds
structure corresponding to led_class and led_id are updated,
if which contains XkbXI_IndicatorStateMask, the
corresponding state field is updated, and if which contains
XkbXI_Indi- catorMapsMask, the maps_present and maps fields
are updated.</p>

<p>If a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the
server or the Xkb extension has not been properly
initialized, XkbGetDeviceLedInfo returns BadAccess. If
allocation errors occur, a BadAlloc status is returned. If
the device has no indicators, a BadMatch error is returned.
If ledClass or ledID have illegal values, a BadValue error
is returned. If they have legal values but do not specify a
feedback that contains LEDs and is associated with the
specified device, a BadMatch error is returned.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess The Xkb extension has not been
properly initialized</p>

<p>BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadMatch A compatible version of Xkb was not available
in the server or an argument has correct type and range, but
is otherwise invalid</p>

<p>BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
