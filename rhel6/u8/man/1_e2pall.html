<p>NAME e2pall - convert all EPS files in a LaTeX document
to PDF</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS e2pall TEXFILE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION e2pall searches through TEXFILE for
includegraphics commands to find the base names of image
files. When it finds one, e2pall runs epstopdf(1) to create
a PDF file from the EPS file.</p>

<p>e2pall will check to be sure that an existing PDF file
is up-to-date with the EPS file, and will not run
epstopdf(1) if the PDF file is newer than the EPS file.</p>

<p>BUGS Seems to be broken</p>

<p>Cannot handle input{filename} or
includegraphics{filename} split over more than one line</p>

<p>Must be run from same directory as the LaTeX file</p>

<p>Does not look down $TEXINPUTS</p>

<p>Cannot handle documents that use include commands</p>

<p>Assumes all files included with includegraphics are EPS
files</p>

<p>SEE ALSO epstopdf(1)</p>
