<p>XGRABDEVICEKEY(3) XGRABDEVICEKEY(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGrabDeviceKey, XUngrabDeviceKey - grab/ungrab
extension input device Keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XGrabDeviceKey( Display *display, XDevice *device,
unsigned int key, unsigned int modifiers, XDevice
*modifier_device, Window grab_window, Bool owner_events,
unsigned int event_count, XEventClass *event_list, int
this_device_mode, int other_devices_mode);</p>

<p>int XUngrabDeviceKey( Display *display, XDevice *device,
unsigned int key, unsigned int modifiers, XDevice
*modifier_device, Window grab_window);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device that is to be grabbed or
released.</p>

<p>Key Specifies the device Key that is to be grabbed
released or AnyKey.</p>

<p>modifiers Specifies the set of keymasks or
AnyModifier.The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the
valid keymask bits.Valid bits are: ShiftMask, LockMask,
ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask,Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask,
Mod5Mask.</p>

<p>modifier_device Specifies the device whose modifiers are
to be used. If a modifier_device ofNULL is specified, the X
keyboard will be used as the modifier_device.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the grab window.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether the deviceevents are to be reported as usual or
reported with respect to the grab windowif selected by the
event list.</p>

<p>event_count Specifies the number of event classes in the
event list.</p>

<p>event_list Specifies which device events are reported to
the client.</p>

<p>this_device_mode Specifies further processing of events
from this device.You can pass GrabModeSync or
GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>other_devices_mode Specifies further processing of
events from other devices.You can pass GrabModeSyncor
GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGrabDeviceKey request establishes a
passive grab. In the future, the device is actively grabbed
(as for XGrabDevice, the last-device-grab time is set to the
time at which the Key was pressed (as transmitted in the
DeviceKeyPress event), and the DeviceKeyPress event is
reported if all of the following conditions are true: * The
device is not grabbed, and the specified key is logically
pressed when the specified modifier keys are logically down,
and no other keys or modifier keys are logically down. * The
grab_window is an ancestor (or is) the focus window OR the
grab window is a descendant of the focus window and contains
the device. * The confine_to window (if any) is viewable. *
A passive grab on the same key/modifier combination does not
exist on any ancestor of grab_window.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
XGrabDevice. The active grab is terminated automatically
when the logical state of the device has the specified key
released.</p>

<p>Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by
means of the X protocol ) may lag the physical state if
device event processing is frozen.</p>

<p>If the key is not AnyKey, it must be in the range
specified by min_keycode and max_keycode as returned by the
XListInputDevices request. Otherwise, a BadValue error
results.</p>

<p>This request overrides all previous grabs by the same
client on the same Key/modifier combinations on the same
window. A modifier of AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing
the grab request for all possible modifier combinations
(including the combination of no modifiers). It is not
required that all modifiers specified have currently
assigned KeyCodes. A key of AnyKey is equivalent to issuing
the request for all possible keys. Otherwise, it is not
required that the specified key currently be assigned to a
physical Key.</p>

<p>If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X
keyboard will be used as the modifier_device.</p>

<p>If some other client has already issued a XGrabDeviceKey
with the same Key/modifier combination on the same window, a
BadAccess error results. When using AnyModifier or AnyKey,
the request fails completely, and a BadAccess error results
(no grabs are established) if there is a conflicting grab
for any combination.XGrabDeviceKey has no effect on an
active grab.</p>

<p>XGrabDeviceKey can generate BadAccess, BadClass,
BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors. It
returns Success on successful completion of the request.</p>

<p>The XUngrabDeviceKey request releases the passive grab
for a key/modifier combination on the specified window if it
was grabbed by this client. A modifier of AnyModifier is
equivalent to issuing the ungrab request for all possible
modifier combinations, including the combination of no
modifiers. A Key of AnyKey is equivalent to issuing the
request for all possible Keys.XUngrabDeviceKey has no effect
on an active grab.</p>

<p>If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X
keyboard will be used as the modifier_device.</p>

<p>XUngrabDeviceKey can generate BadDevice, BadMatch,
BadValue and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer
device.</p>

<p>BadMatch This error may occur if an XGrabDeviceKey
request was made specifying a device that has no keys, or a
modifier device that has no keys.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
