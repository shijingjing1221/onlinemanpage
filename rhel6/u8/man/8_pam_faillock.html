<p>PAM_FAILLOCK(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_FAILLOCK(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_faillock - Module counting authentication
failures during a specified interval</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS auth ... pam_faillock.so
{preauth|authfail|authsucc} [dir=/path/to/tally-directory]
[even_deny_root] [deny=n] [fail_interval=n] [unlock_time=n]
[root_unlock_time=n] [audit] [silent] [no_log_info]</p>

<p>account ... pam_faillock.so
[dir=/path/to/tally-directory] [no_log_info]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This module maintains a list of failed
authentication attempts per user during a specified interval
and locks the account in case there were more than deny
consecutive failed authentications.</p>

<p>Normally, failed attempts to authenticate root will not
cause the root account to become blocked, to prevent
denial-of-service: if your users aren&acute;t given shell
accounts and root may only login via su or at the machine
console (not telnet/rsh, etc), this is safe.</p>

<p>OPTIONS {preauth|authfail|authsucc} This argument must
be set accordingly to the position of this module instance
in the PAM stack.</p>

<p>The preauth argument must be used when the module is
called before the modules which ask for the user credentials
such as the password. The module just examines whether the
user should be blocked from accessing the service in case
there were anomalous number of failed consecutive
authentication attempts recently. This call is optional if
authsucc is used.</p>

<p>The authfail argument must be used when the module is
called after the modules which determine the authentication
outcome, failed. Unless the user is already blocked due to
previous authentication failures, the module will record the
failure into the appropriate user tally file.</p>

<p>The authsucc argument must be used when the module is
called after the modules which determine the authentication
outcome, succeded. Unless the user is already blocked due to
previous authentication failures, the module will then clear
the record of the failures in the respective user tally
file. Otherwise it will return authentication error. If this
call is not done, the pam_faillock will not distinguish
between consecutive and non-consecutive failed
authentication attempts. The preauth call must be used in
such case. Due to complications in the way the PAM stack can
be configured it is also possible to call pam_faillock as an
account module. In such configuration the module must be
also called in the preauth stage.</p>

<p>dir=/path/to/tally-directory The directory where the
user files with the failure records are kept. The default is
/var/run/faillock.</p>

<p>audit Will log the user name into the system log if the
user is not found.</p>

<p>silent Don&acute;t print informative messages. This
option is implicite in the authfail and authsucc
functions.</p>

<p>no_log_info Don&acute;t log informative messages via
syslog(3).</p>

<p>deny=n Deny access if the number of consecutive
authentication failures for this user during the recent
interval exceeds n. The default is 3.</p>

<p>fail_interval=n The length of the interval during which
the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the
user account lock out is n seconds. The default is 900 (15
minutes).</p>

<p>unlock_time=n The access will be reenabled after n
seconds after the lock out. The default is 600 (10
minutes).</p>

<p>even_deny_root Root account can become locked as well as
regular accounts.</p>

<p>root_unlock_time=n This option implies even_deny_root
option. Allow access after n seconds to root account after
the account is locked. In case the option is not specified
the value is the same as of the unlock_time option.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED The auth and account module types
are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTH_ERR A invalid option was given,
the module was not able to retrieve the user name, no valid
counter file was found, or too many failed logins.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Everything was successful.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE User not present in passwd database.</p>

<p>NOTES pam_faillock setup in the PAM stack is different
from the pam_tally2 module setup.</p>

<p>The individual files with the failure records are
created as owned by the user. This allows pam_faillock.so
module to work correctly when it is called from a
screensaver.</p>

<p>Note that using the module in preauth without the silent
option or with requisite control field leaks an information
about existence or non-existence of an user account in the
system because the failures are not recorded for the unknown
users. The message about the user account being locked is
never displayed for nonexisting user accounts allowing the
adversary to infer that a particular account is not existing
on a system.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Here are two possible configuration examples
for /etc/pam.d/login. They make pam_faillock to lock the
account after 4 consecutive failed logins during the default
interval of 15 minutes. Root account will be locked as well.
The accounts will be automatically unlocked after 20
minutes.</p>

<p>In the first example the module is called only in the
auth phase and the module does not print any information
about the account blocking by pam_faillock. The preauth call
can be added to tell the user that his login is blocked by
the module and also to abort the authentication without even
asking for password in such case.</p>

<p>auth required pam_securetty.so auth required pam_env.so
auth required pam_nologin.so # optionally call: auth
requisite pam_faillock.so preauth deny=4 even_deny_root
unlock_time=1200 # to display the message about account
being locked auth [success=1 default=bad] pam_unix.so auth
[default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail deny=4 even_deny_root
unlock_time=1200 auth sufficient pam_faillock.so authsucc
deny=4 even_deny_root unlock_time=1200 auth required
pam_deny.so account required pam_unix.so password required
pam_unix.so shadow session required pam_selinux.so close
session required pam_loginuid.so session required
pam_unix.so session required pam_selinux.so open</p>

<p>In the second example the module is called both in the
auth and account phases and the module gives the
authenticating user message when the account is locked</p>

<p>auth required pam_securetty.so auth required pam_env.so
auth required pam_nologin.so auth required pam_faillock.so
preauth silent deny=4 even_deny_root unlock_time=1200 #
optionally use requisite above if you do not want to prompt
for the password # on locked accounts, possibly with
removing the silent option as well auth sufficient
pam_unix.so auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail
deny=4 even_deny_root unlock_time=1200 auth required
pam_deny.so account required pam_faillock.so # if you drop
the above call to pam_faillock.so the lock will be done also
# on non-consecutive authentication failures account
required pam_unix.so password required pam_unix.so shadow
session required pam_selinux.so close session required
pam_loginuid.so session required pam_unix.so session
required pam_selinux.so open</p>
