<p>NAME rsyslogd - reliable and extended syslogd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rsyslogd [ -4 ] [ -6 ] [ -A ] [ -d ] [ -f
config file ] [ -i pid file ] [ -l hostlist ] [ -n ] [ -N
level ] [ -q ] [ -Q ] [ -s domainlist ] [ -u userlevel ] [
-v ] [ -w ] [ -x ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rsyslogd is a system utility providing
support for message logging. Support of both internet and
unix domain sockets enables this utility to support both
local and remote logging.</p>

<p>Note that this version of rsyslog ships with extensive
documentation in html format. This is provided in the ./doc
subdirectory and probably in a separate package if you
installed rsyslog via a packaging system. To use rsyslogs
advanced features, you need to look at the html docu-
mentation, because the man pages only cover basic aspects of
operation. For details and configuration examples, see the
rsyslog.conf (5) man page and the online documentation at
http://www.rsyslog.com/doc</p>

<p>Rsyslogd(8) is derived from the sysklogd package which
in turn is derived from the stock BSD sources.</p>

<p>Rsyslogd provides a kind of logging that many modern
programs use. Every logged message contains at least a time
and a hostname field, normally a program name field, too,
but that depends on how trusty the logging program is. The
rsyslog package supports free definition of output formats
via templates. It also supports precise timestamps and
writing directly to databases. If the database option is
used, tools like phpLogCon can be used to view the log
data.</p>

<p>While the rsyslogd sources have been heavily modified a
couple of notes are in order. First of all there has been a
systematic attempt to ensure that rsyslogd follows its
default, standard BSD behavior. Of course, some
configuration file changes are necessary in order to sup-
port the template system. However, rsyslogd should be able
to use a standard syslog.conf and act like the original
syslogd. However, an original syslogd will not work
correctly with a rsyslog-enhanced con- figuration file. At
best, it will generate funny looking file names. The second
important concept to note is that this version of rsyslogd
interacts transparently with the version of syslog found in
the stan- dard libraries. If a binary linked to the standard
shared libraries fails to function correctly we would like
an example of the anomalous behavior.</p>

<p>The main configuration file /etc/rsyslog.conf or an
alternative file, given with the -f option, is read at
startup. Any lines that begin with the hash mark (#) and
empty lines are ignored. If an error occurs during parsing
the error element is ignored. It is tried to parse the rest
of the line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Note that in version 3 of rsyslog a number of
command line options have been deprecated and replaced with
config file directives. The -c option controls the backward
compatibility mode in use.</p>

<p>-A When sending UDP messages, there are potentially
multiple paths to the target destination. By default,
rsyslogd only sends to the first target it can successfully
send to. If -A is given, messages are sent to all targets.
This may improve reliability, but may also cause message
duplication. This option should be enabled only if it is
fully understood.</p>

<p>-4 Causes rsyslogd to listen to IPv4 addresses only. If
neither -4 nor -6 is given, rsyslogd listens to all
configured addresses of the system.</p>

<p>-6 Causes rsyslogd to listen to IPv6 addresses only. If
neither -4 nor -6 is given, rsyslogd listens to all
configured addresses of the system.</p>

<p>-c version Selects the desired backward compatibility
mode. It must always be the first option on the command
line, as it influences pro- cessing of the other options. To
use the rsyslog v3 native interface, specify -c3. To use
compatibility mode , either do not use -c at all or use
-c&lt;version&gt; where version is the rsys- log version
that it shall be compatible with. Using -c0 tells rsyslog to
be command-line compatible to sysklogd, which is the default
if -c is not given. Please note that rsyslogd issues warning
messages if the -c3 command line option is not given. This
is to alert you that your are running in compatibility mode.
Compatibility mode interferes with your rsyslog.conf com-
mands and may cause some undesired side-effects. It is meant
to be used with a plain old rsyslog.conf - if you use new
features, things become messy. So the best advice is to work
through this document, convert your options and config file
and then use rsyslog in native mode. In order to aid you in
this process, rsyslog logs every compatibility-mode config
file directive it has generated. So you can simply copy them
from your logfile and paste them to the config.</p>

<p>-d Turns on debug mode. See the DEBUGGING section for
more informa- tion.</p>

<p>-f config file Specify an alternative configuration file
instead of /etc/rsys- log.conf, which is the default.</p>

<p>-i pid file Specify an alternative pid file instead of
the default one. This option must be used if multiple
instances of rsyslogd should run on a single machine.</p>

<p>-l hostlist Specify a hostname that should be logged
only with its simple hostname and not the fqdn. Multiple
hosts may be specified using the colon (:) separator.</p>

<p>-n Avoid auto-backgrounding. This is needed especially
if the rsyslogd is started and controlled by init(8).</p>

<p>-N level Do a coNfig check. Do NOT run in regular mode,
just check con- figuration file correctness. This option is
meant to verify a config file. To do so, run rsyslogd
interactively in foreground, specifying -f
&lt;config-file&gt; and -N level. The level argument
modifies behaviour. Currently, 0 is the same as not
specifying the -N option at all (so this makes limited
sense) and 1 actu- ally activates the code. Later, higher
levels will mean more verbosity (this is a
forward-compatibility option). rsyslogd is started and
controlled by init(8).</p>

<p>-q add hostname if DNS fails during ACL processing
During ACL processing, hostnames are resolved to IP
addresses for performance reasons. If DNS fails during that
process, the hostname is added as wildcard text, which
results in proper, but somewhat slower operation once DNS is
up again.</p>

<p>-Q do not resolve hostnames during ACL processing Do not
resolve hostnames to IP addresses during ACL processing.</p>

<p>-s domainlist Specify a domainname that should be
stripped off before logging. Multiple domains may be
specified using the colon (:) sepa- rator. Please be advised
that no sub-domains may be specified but only entire
domains. For example if -s north.de is speci- fied and the
host logging resolves to satu.infodrom.north.de no domain
would be cut, you will have to specify two domains like: -s
north.de:infodrom.north.de.</p>

<p>-u userlevel This is a &quot;catch all&quot; option for
some very seldomly-used user settings. The
&quot;userlevel&quot; variable selects multiple things. Add
the specific values to get the combined effect of them. A
value of 1 prevents rsyslogd from parsing hostnames and tags
inside messages. A value of 2 prevents rsyslogd from
changing to the root directory. This is almost never a good
idea in production use. This option was introduced in
support of the internal testbed. To combine these two
features, use a userlevel of 3 (1+2). Whenever you use an -u
option, make sure you really understand what you do and why
you do it.</p>

<p>-v Print version and exit.</p>

<p>-w Suppress warnings issued when messages are received
from non- authorized machines (those, that are in no
AllowedSender list).</p>

<p>-x Disable DNS for remote messages.</p>

<p>SIGNALS Rsyslogd reacts to a set of signals. You may
easily send a signal to rsyslogd using the following:</p>

<p>kill -SIGNAL $(cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid)</p>

<p>Note that -SIGNAL must be replaced with the actual
signal you are try- ing to send, e.g. with HUP. So it then
becomes:</p>

<p>kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid)</p>

<p>HUP This lets rsyslogd perform close all open files.
Also, in v3 a full restart will be done in order to read
changed configuration files. Note that this means a full
rsyslogd restart is done. This has, among others, the
consequence that TCP and other con- nections are torn down.
Also, if any queues are not running in disk assisted mode or
are not set to persist data on shutdown, queue data is lost.
HUPing rsyslogd is an extremely expensive operation and
should only be done when actually necessary. Actu- ally, it
is a rsyslgod stop immediately followed by a restart. Future
versions will remove this restart functionality of HUP (it
will go away in v5). So it is advised to use HUP only for
closing files, and a &quot;real restart&quot; (e.g.
/etc/rc.d/rsyslogd restart) to activate configuration
changes.</p>

<p>TERM , INT , QUIT Rsyslogd will die.</p>

<p>USR1 Switch debugging on/off. This option can only be
used if rsys- logd is started with the -d debug option.</p>

<p>CHLD Wait for childs if some were born, because of wall
ing messages.</p>

<p>SECURITY THREATS There is the potential for the rsyslogd
daemon to be used as a conduit for a denial of service
attack. A rogue program(mer) could very easily flood the
rsyslogd daemon with syslog messages resulting in the log
files consuming all the remaining space on the filesystem.
Activating logging over the inet domain sockets will of
course expose a system to risks outside of programs or
individuals on the local machine.</p>

<p>There are a number of methods of protecting a
machine:</p>

<p>1. Implement kernel firewalling to limit which hosts or
networks have access to the 514/UDP socket.</p>

<p>2. Logging can be directed to an isolated or non-root
filesystem which, if filled, will not impair the
machine.</p>

<p>3. The ext2 filesystem can be used which can be
configured to limit a certain percentage of a filesystem to
usage by root only. NOTE that this will require rsyslogd to
be run as a non-root process. ALSO NOTE that this will
prevent usage of remote log- ging on the default port since
rsyslogd will be unable to bind to the 514/UDP socket.</p>

<p>4. Disabling inet domain sockets will limit risk to the
local machine.</p>

<p>Message replay and spoofing If remote logging is
enabled, messages can easily be spoofed and replayed. As the
messages are transmitted in clear-text, an attacker might
use the information obtained from the packets for malicious
things. Also, an attacker might replay recorded messages or
spoof a senders IP address, which could lead to a wrong
perception of system activity. These can be prevented by
using GSS-API authentication and encryption. Be sure to
think about syslog network security before enabling it.</p>

<p>DEBUGGING When debugging is turned on using the -d
option, rsyslogd produces debugging information according to
the RSYSLOG_DEBUG environment vari- able and the signals
received. When run in foreground, the information is written
to stdout. An additional output file can be specified using
the RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG environment variable.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/rsyslog.conf Configuration file for rsyslogd.
See rsyslog.conf(5) for exact information. /dev/log The Unix
domain socket to from where local syslog messages are read.
/var/run/rsyslogd.pid The file containing the process id of
rsyslogd. prefix/lib/rsyslog Default directory for rsyslogd
modules. The prefix is specified during compilation (e.g.
/usr/local). ENVIRONMENT RSYSLOG_DEBUG Controls runtime
debug support. It contains an option string with the
following options possible (all are case insensitive):</p>

<p>Debug Turns on debugging and prevents forking. This is
pro- cessed earlier in the startup than command line options
(i.e. -d) and as such enables earlier debugging output.
Mutually exclusive with DebugOnDemand. DebugOnDemand Enables
debugging but turns off debug output. The output can be
toggled by sending SIGUSR1. Mutually exclusive with Debug.
LogFuncFlow Print out the logical flow of functions
(entering and exiting them) FileTrace Specifies which files
to trace LogFuncFlow. If not set (the default), a
LogFuncFlow trace is provided for all files. Set to limit it
to the files specified.FileTrace may be specified multiple
times, one file each (e.g. export
RSYSLOG_DEBUG=&quot;LogFuncFlow FileTrace=vm.c File-
Trace=expr.c&quot; PrintFuncDB Print the content of the
debug function database whenever debug information is
printed (e.g. abort case)! PrintAllDebugInfoOnExit Print all
debug information immediately before rsyslogd exits
(currently not implemented!) PrintMutexAction Print mutex
action as it happens. Useful for finding deadlocks and such.
NoLogTimeStamp Do not prefix log lines with a timestamp
(default is to do that). NoStdOut Do not emit debug messages
to stdout. If RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG is not set, this means no
messages will be displayed at all. Help Display a very short
list of commands - hopefully a life saver if you can t
access the documentation...</p>

<p>RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG If set, writes (almost) all debug
message to the specified log file in addition to stdout.
RSYSLOG_MODDIR Provides the default directory in which
loadable modules reside.</p>

<p>COLLABORATORS rsyslogd is derived from sysklogd sources,
which in turn was taken from the BSD sources. Special thanks
to Greg Wettstein (greg@wind.enjel- lic.com) and Martin
Schulze (joey@linux.de) for the fine sysklogd pack- age.</p>
