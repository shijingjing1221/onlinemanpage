<p>BUS_FOR_EACH_DRV(9) Device drivers infrastructure
BUS_FOR_EACH_DRV(9)</p>

<p>NAME bus_for_each_drv - driver iterator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int bus_for_each_drv(struct bus_type * bus,
struct device_driver * start, void * data, int (*fn) (struct
device_driver *, void *));</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS bus bus we&acute;re dealing with.</p>

<p>start driver to start iterating on.</p>

<p>data data to pass to the callback.</p>

<p>fn function to call for each driver.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is nearly identical to the device
iterator above. We iterate over each driver that belongs to
bus, and call fn for each. If fn returns anything but 0, we
break out and return it. If start is not NULL, we use it as
the head of the list.</p>

<p>NOTE we don&acute;t return the driver that returns a
non-zero value, nor do we leave the reference count
incremented for that driver. If the caller needs to know
that info, it must set it in the callback. It must also be
sure to increment the refcount so it doesn&acute;t disappear
before returning to the caller.</p>
