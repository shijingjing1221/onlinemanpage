<p>ASA(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ASA(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME asa - interpret carriage-control characters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS asa [ file ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The asa utility shall write its input files
to standard output, mapping carriage-control characters from
the text files to line-printer control sequences in an
implementation-defined manner.</p>

<p>The first character of every line shall be removed from
the input, and the following actions are performed.</p>

<p>If the character removed is:</p>

<p>&lt;space&gt; The rest of the line is output without
change.</p>

<p>0 A &lt;newline&gt; is output, then the rest of the
input line.</p>

<p>1 One or more implementation-defined characters that
causes an advance to the next page shall be output, followed
by the rest of the input line.</p>

<p>+ The &lt;newline&gt; of the previous line shall be
replaced with one or more implementation-defined characters
that causes printing to return to column position 1,
followed by the rest of the input line. If the+is the first
character in the input, it shall be equivalent to
&lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p>The action of the asa utility is unspecified upon
encountering any character other than those listed above as
the first character in a line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS file A pathname of a text file used for input.
If no file operands are specified, the standard input shall
be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied; see the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of asa:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be the text from the
input file modified as described in the DESCRIPTION
section.</p>

<p>STDERR None.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were output successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following command:</p>

<p>asa file</p>

<p>permits the viewing of file (created by a program using
FORTRAN-style carriage-control characters) on a
terminal.</p>

<p>2. The following command:</p>

<p>a.out | asa | lp</p>

<p>formats the FORTRAN output of a.out and directs it to
the printer.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The asa utility is needed to map
&quot;standard&quot; FORTRAN 77 output into a form
acceptable to contemporary printers. Usually, asa is used to
pipe data to the lp utility; see lp.</p>

<p>This utility is generally used only by FORTRAN programs.
The standard developers decided to retain asa to avoid
breaking the historical large base of FORTRAN applications
that put carriage-control characters in their output files.
There is no requirement that a system have a FOR- TRAN
compiler in order to run applications that need asa.</p>

<p>Historical implementations have used an ASCII
&lt;form-feed&gt; in response to a 1 and an ASCII
&lt;carriage-return&gt; in response to a+ . It is sug-
gested that implementations treat characters other than 0,
1, and+ as &lt;space&gt; in the absence of any compelling
reason to do otherwise. However, the action is listed here
as &quot;unspecified&quot;, permitting an implementation to
provide extensions to access fast multiple-line slew- ing
and channel seeking in a non-portable manner.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
