<p>DESCRIPTION This extension is a minimal set of client
and server extensions required to completely test the X11
server with no user intervention. This extension is not
intended to support general journaling and playback of user
actions.</p>

<p>The functions provided by this extension fall into two
groups:</p>

<p>Client Operations These routines manipulate otherwise
hidden client-side behavior. The actual implementation will
depend on the details of the actual language binding and
what degree of request buffering, GContext caching, and so
on, is provided. In the C binding, routines are provided to
access the internals of two opaque data structures GCs and
Visuals and to discard any requests pending within the
output buffer of a connection. The exact details can be
expected to differ for other language bindings.</p>

<p>Server Requests The first of these requests is similar
to that provided in most extensions: it allows a client to
specify a major and minor version number to the server and
for the server to respond with major and minor versions of
its own. The remaining two requests allow the following:</p>

<p>&middot; Access to an otherwise write-only server
resource: the cursor associated with a given window</p>

<p>&middot; Perhaps most importantly, limited synthesis of
input device events, almost as if a cooperative user had
moved the pointing device or pressed a key or button.</p>

<p>All XTEST extension functions and procedures, and all
manifest constants and macros, will start with the string
XTest. All operations are classified as server/client
(Server) or client-only (Client).</p>

<p>XTestQueryExtension returns True if the specified
display supports the XTEST extension, else False. If the
extension is supported, *event_base would be set to the
event number for the first event for this extension and
*error_base would be set to the error number for the first
error for this extension. As no errors or events are defined
for this version of the extension, the values returned here
are not defined (nor useful). If the extension is supported,
*major_version and *minor_version are set to the major and
minor version numbers of the extension supported by the
display. Otherwise, none of the arguments are set.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported,
XTestCompareCursorWithWindow performs a comparison of the
cursor whose ID is specified by cursor (which may be None)
with the cursor of the window specified by window returning
True if they are the same and False otherwise. If the
extension is not supported, then the request is ignored and
zero is returned.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported,
XTestCompareCurrentCursorWithWindow performs a comparison of
the current cursor with the cursor of the specified window
returning True if they are the same and False otherwise. If
the extension is not supported, then the request is ignored
and zero is returned.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported, XTestFakeKeyEvent
requests the server to simulate either a KeyPress (if
is_press is True) or a KeyRelease (if is_press is False) of
the key with the specified keycode; otherwise, the request
is ignored.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported, the simulated event will
not be processed until delay milliseconds after the request
is received (if delay is CurrentTime, then this is
interpreted as no delay at all). No other requests from this
client will be processed until this delay, if any, has
expired and subsequent processing of the simulated event has
been completed.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported, XTestFakeButtonEvent
requests the server to simulate either a ButtonPress (if
is_press is True) or a ButtonRelease (if is_press is False)
of the logical button numbered by the specified button;
otherwise, the request is ignored.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported, the simulated event will
not be processed until delay milliseconds after the request
is received (if delay is CurrentTime, then this is
interpreted as no delay at all). No other requests from this
client will be processed until this delay, if any, has
expired and subsequent processing of the simulated event has
been completed.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported, XTestFakeMotionEvent
requests the server to simulate a movement of the pointer to
the specified position (x, y) on the root window of
screen_number; otherwise, the request is ignored. If
screen_number is -1, the current screen (that the pointer is
on) is used.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported, the simulated event will
not be processed until delay milliseconds after the request
is received (if delay is CurrentTime, then this is
interpreted as no delay at all). No other requests from this
client will be processed until this delay, if any, has
expired and subsequent processing of the simulated event has
been completed.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported,
XTestFakeRelativeMotionEvent requests the server to simulate
a movement of the pointer by the specified offsets (x, y)
relative to the current pointer position on screen_number;
otherwise, the request is ignored. If screen_number is -1,
the current screen (that the pointer is on) is used.</p>

<p>If the extension is supported, the simulated event will
not be processed until delay milliseconds after the request
is received (if delay is CurrentTime, then this is
interpreted as no delay at all). No other requests from this
client will be processed until this delay, if any, has
expired and subsequent processing of the simulated event has
been completed.</p>

<p>If impervious is True, then the executing client becomes
impervious to server grabs. If impervious is False, then the
executing client returns to the normal state of being
susceptible to server grabs.</p>

<p>XTestSetGContextOfGC sets the GContext within the opaque
datatype referenced by gc to be that specified by gid.</p>

<p>XTestSetVisualIDOfVisual sets the VisualID within the
opaque datatype referenced by visual to be that specified by
visualid.</p>

<p>XTestDiscard discards any requests within the output
buffer for the specified display. It returns True if any
requests were discarded; otherwise, it returns False.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES All routines that have return type Status
will return nonzero for success and zero for failure. Even
if the XTEST extension is supported, the server may withdraw
such facilities arbitrarily; in which case they will
subsequently return zero.</p>
