<p>NAME gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn_by_oid - return the
CRL s issuer distin- guished name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/x509.h&gt;</p>

<p>int
gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crl_t crl,
const char * oid, int indx, unsigned int raw_flag, void *
buf, size_t * sizeof_buf);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_x509_crl_t crl should contain a
gnutls_x509_crl_t structure</p>

<p>const char * oid holds an Object Identified in null
terminated string</p>

<p>int indx In case multiple same OIDs exist in the RDN,
this specifies which to send. Use zero to get the first
one.</p>

<p>unsigned int raw_flag If non zero returns the raw DER
data of the DN part.</p>

<p>void * buf a pointer to a structure to hold the peers
name (may be null)</p>

<p>size_t * sizeof_buf initially holds the size of buf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will extract the part of the
name of the CRL issuer spec- ified by the given OID. The
output will be encoded as described in RFC2253. The output
string will be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the
certificate data.</p>

<p>Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in
gnutls/x509.h If raw flag is zero, this function will only
return known OIDs as text. Other OIDs will be DER encoded,
as described in RFC2253 -- in hex for- mat with a using
gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known().</p>

<p>If buf is null then only the size will be filled.</p>

<p>RETURNS GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided
buffer is not long enough, and in that case the sizeof_buf
will be updated with the required size, and 0 on
success.</p>
