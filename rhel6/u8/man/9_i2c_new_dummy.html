<p>I2C_NEW_DUMMY(9) I2C and SMBus Subsystem
I2C_NEW_DUMMY(9)</p>

<p>NAME i2c_new_dummy - return a new i2c device bound to a
dummy driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct i2c_client * i2c_new_dummy(struct
i2c_adapter * adapter, u16 address);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS adapter the adapter managing the device</p>

<p>address seven bit address to be used</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This returns an I2C client bound to the
dummy driver, intended for use with devices that consume
multiple addresses. Examples of such chips include various
EEPROMS (like 24c04 and 24c08 models).</p>

<p>These dummy devices have two main uses. First, most I2C
and SMBus calls except i2c_transfer need a client handle;
the dummy will be that handle. And second, this prevents the
specified address from being bound to a different
driver.</p>

<p>This returns the new i2c client, which should be saved
for later use with i2c_unregister_device; or NULL to
indicate an error.</p>
