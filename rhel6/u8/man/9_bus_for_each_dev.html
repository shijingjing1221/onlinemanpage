<p>BUS_FOR_EACH_DEV(9) Device drivers infrastructure
BUS_FOR_EACH_DEV(9)</p>

<p>NAME bus_for_each_dev - device iterator.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int bus_for_each_dev(struct bus_type * bus,
struct device * start, void * data, int (*fn) (struct device
*, void *));</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS bus bus type.</p>

<p>start device to start iterating from.</p>

<p>data data for the callback.</p>

<p>fn function to be called for each device.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Iterate over bus&acute;s list of devices,
and call fn for each, passing it data. If start is not NULL,
we use that device to begin iterating from.</p>

<p>We check the return of fn each time. If it returns
anything other than 0, we break out and return that
value.</p>

<p>NOTE The device that returns a non-zero value is not
retained in any way, nor is its refcount incremented. If the
caller needs to retain this data, it should do so, and
increment the reference count in the supplied callback.</p>
