<p>NAME perlref - Perl references and nested data
structures</p>

<p>NOTE This is complete documentation about all aspects of
references. For a shorter, tutorial introduction to just the
essential features, see perlreftut.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Before release 5 of Perl it was difficult to
represent complex data structures, because all references
had to be symbolic--and even then it was difficult to refer
to a variable instead of a symbol table entry. Perl now not
only makes it easier to use symbolic references to
variables, but also lets you have &quot;hard&quot;
references to any piece of data or code. Any scalar may hold
a hard reference. Because arrays and hashes contain scalars,
you can now easily build arrays of arrays, arrays of hashes,
hashes of arrays, arrays of hashes of functions, and so
on.</p>

<p>Hard references are smart--they keep track of reference
counts for you, automatically freeing the thing referred to
when its reference count goes to zero. (Reference counts for
values in self-referential or cyclic data structures may not
go to zero without a little help; see &quot;Two-Phased
Garbage Collection&quot; in perlobj for a detailed
explanation.) If that thing happens to be an object, the
object is destructed. See perlobj for more about objects.
(In a sense, everything in Perl is an object, but we usually
reserve the word for references to objects that have been
officially &quot;blessed&quot; into a class package.)</p>

<p>Symbolic references are names of variables or other
objects, just as a symbolic link in a Unix filesystem
contains merely the name of a file. The *glob notation is
something of a symbolic reference. (Symbolic references are
sometimes called &quot;soft references&quot;, but please
dont call them that; references are confusing enough without
useless synonyms.)</p>

<p>In contrast, hard references are more like hard links in
a Unix file system: They are used to access an underlying
object without concern for what its (other) name is. When
the word &quot;reference&quot; is used without an adjective,
as in the following paragraph, it is usually talking about a
hard reference.</p>

<p>References are easy to use in Perl. There is just one
overriding principle: Perl does no implicit referencing or
dereferencing. When a scalar is holding a reference, it
always behaves as a simple scalar. It doesnt magically start
being an array or hash or subroutine; you have to tell it
explicitly to do so, by dereferencing it.</p>

<p>Making References References can be created in several
ways.</p>

<p>1. By using the backslash operator on a variable,
subroutine, or value. (This works much like the &amp;
(address-of) operator in C.) This typically creates another
reference to a variable, because there s already a reference
to the variable in the symbol table. But the symbol table
reference might go away, and you ll still have the reference
that the backslash returned. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>$scalarref = oo; $arrayref = @ARGV; $hashref = ENV;
$coderef = handler; $globref = oo;</p>

<p>It isnt possible to create a true reference to an IO
handle (filehandle or dirhandle) using the backslash
operator. The most you can get is a reference to a typeglob,
which is actually a complete symbol table entry. But see the
explanation of the *foo{THING} syntax below. However, you
can still use type globs and globrefs as though they were IO
handles.</p>

<p>2. A reference to an anonymous array can be created
using square brackets:</p>

<p>$arrayref = [1, 2, [&rsquo;a&rsquo;, &rsquo;b&rsquo;,
&rsquo;c&rsquo;]];</p>

<p>Here weve created a reference to an anonymous array of
three elements whose final element is itself a reference to
another anonymous array of three elements. (The
multidimensional syntax described later can be used to
access this. For example, after the above,
&quot;$arrayref-&gt;[2][1]&quot; would have the value
&quot;b&quot;.)</p>

<p>Taking a reference to an enumerated list is not the same
as using square brackets--instead its the same as creating a
list of references!</p>

<p>@list = (, @b, c); @list = , @b, %c); # same thing!</p>

<p>As a special case, &quot;oo)&quot; returns a list of
references to the contents of @foo, not a reference to @foo
itself. Likewise for %foo, except that the key references
are to copies (since the keys are just strings rather than
full-fledged scalars).</p>

<p>3. A reference to an anonymous hash can be created using
curly brackets:</p>

<p>$hashref = { &rsquo;Adam&rsquo; =&gt; &rsquo;Eve&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Clyde&rsquo; =&gt; &rsquo;Bonnie&rsquo;, };</p>

<p>Anonymous hash and array composers like these can be
intermixed freely to produce as complicated a structure as
you want. The multidimensional syntax described below works
for these too. The values above are literals, but variables
and expressions would work just as well, because assignment
operators in Perl (even within local() or my()) are
executable statements, not compile-time declarations.</p>

<p>Because curly brackets (braces) are used for several
other things including BLOCKs, you may occasionally have to
disambiguate braces at the beginning of a statement by
putting a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;return&quot; in front so
that Perl realizes the opening brace isn t starting a BLOCK.
The economy and mnemonic value of using curlies is deemed
worth this occasional extra hassle.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted a function to make a new hash
and return a reference to it, you have these options:</p>

<p>sub hashem { { @_ } } # silently wrong sub hashem { +{
@_ } } # ok sub hashem { return { @_ } } # ok</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want the other meaning, you
can do this:</p>

<p>sub showem { { @_ } } # ambiguous (currently ok, but may
change) sub showem { {; @_ } } # ok sub showem { { return @_
} } # ok</p>

<p>The leading &quot;+{&quot; and &quot;{;&quot; always
serve to disambiguate the expression to mean either the HASH
reference, or the BLOCK.</p>

<p>4. A reference to an anonymous subroutine can be created
by using &quot;sub&quot; without a subname:</p>

<p>$coderef = sub { print &quot;Boink!0 };</p>

<p>Note the semicolon. Except for the code inside not being
immediately executed, a &quot;sub {}&quot; is not so much a
declaration as it is an operator, like &quot;do{}&quot; or
&quot;eval{}&quot;. (However, no matter how many times you
execute that particular line (unless youre in an
&quot;eval(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;), $coderef will still have
a reference to the same anonymous subroutine.)</p>

<p>Anonymous subroutines act as closures with respect to
my() variables, that is, variables lexically visible within
the current scope. Closure is a notion out of the Lisp world
that says if you define an anonymous function in a
particular lexical context, it pretends to run in that
context even when its called outside the context.</p>

<p>In human terms, its a funny way of passing arguments to
a subroutine when you define it as well as when you call it.
Its useful for setting up little bits of code to run later,
such as callbacks. You can even do object-oriented stuff
with it, though Perl already provides a different mechanism
to do that--see perlobj.</p>

<p>You might also think of closure as a way to write a
subroutine template without using eval(). Heres a small
example of how closures work:</p>

<p>sub newprint { my $x = shift; return sub { my $y =
shift; print &quot;$x, $y!0; }; } $h =
newprint(&quot;Howdy&quot;); $g =
newprint(&quot;Greetings&quot;);</p>

<p># Time passes...</p>

<p>&amp;$h(&quot;world&quot;);
&amp;$g(&quot;earthlings&quot;);</p>

<p>This prints</p>

<p>Howdy, world! Greetings, earthlings!</p>

<p>Note particularly that $x continues to refer to the
value passed into newprint() despite &quot;my $x&quot;
having gone out of scope by the time the anonymous
subroutine runs. That s what a closure is all about.</p>

<p>This applies only to lexical variables, by the way.
Dynamic variables continue to work as they have always
worked. Closure is not something that most Perl programmers
need trouble themselves about to begin with.</p>

<p>5. References are often returned by special subroutines
called constructors. Perl objects are just references to a
special type of object that happens to know which package it
s associated with. Constructors are just special subroutines
that know how to create that association. They do so by
starting with an ordinary reference, and it remains an
ordinary reference even while its also being an object.
Constructors are often named &quot;new()&quot;. You can call
them indirectly:</p>

<p>$objref = new Doggie( Tail =&gt; &rsquo;short&rsquo;,
Ears =&gt; &rsquo;long&rsquo; );</p>

<p>But that can produce ambiguous syntax in certain cases,
so its often better to use the direct method invocation
approach:</p>

<p>$objref = Doggie-&gt;new(Tail =&gt; &rsquo;short&rsquo;,
Ears =&gt; &rsquo;long&rsquo;);</p>

<p>use Term::Cap; $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( {
OSPEED =&gt; 9600 });</p>

<p>use Tk; $main = MainWindow-&gt;new(); $menubar =
$main-&gt;Frame(-relief =&gt; &quot;raised&quot;,
-borderwidth =&gt; 2)</p>

<p>6. References of the appropriate type can spring into
existence if you dereference them in a context that assumes
they exist. Because we havent talked about dereferencing
yet, we can t show you any examples yet.</p>

<p>7. A reference can be created by using a special syntax,
lovingly known as the *foo{THING} syntax. *foo{THING}
returns a reference to the THING slot in *foo (which is the
symbol table entry which holds everything known as foo).</p>

<p>$scalarref = *foo{SCALAR}; $arrayref = *ARGV{ARRAY};
$hashref = *ENV{HASH}; $coderef = *handler{CODE}; $ioref =
*STDIN{IO}; $globref = *foo{GLOB}; $formatref =
*foo{FORMAT};</p>

<p>All of these are self-explanatory except for *foo{IO}.
It returns the IO handle, used for file handles
(&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), sockets (&quot;socket&quot;
in perlfunc and &quot;socketpair&quot; in perlfunc), and
directory handles (&quot;opendir&quot; in perlfunc). For
compatibility with previous versions of Perl,
*foo{FILEHANDLE} is a synonym for *foo{IO}, though it is
deprecated as of 5.8.0. If deprecation warnings are in
effect, it will warn of its use.</p>

<p>*foo{THING} returns undef if that particular THING hasnt
been used yet, except in the case of scalars. *foo{SCALAR}
returns a reference to an anonymous scalar if $foo hasn t
been used yet. This might change in a future release.</p>

<p>*foo{IO} is an alternative to the *HANDLE mechanism
given in &quot;Typeglobs and Filehandles&quot; in perldata
for passing filehandles into or out of subroutines, or
storing into larger data structures. Its disadvantage is
that it won t create a new filehandle for you. Its advantage
is that you have less risk of clobbering more than you want
to with a typeglob assignment. (It still conflates file and
directory handles, though.) However, if you assign the
incoming value to a scalar instead of a typeglob as we do in
the examples below, theres no risk of that happening.</p>

<p>splutter(*STDOUT); # pass the whole glob
splutter(*STDOUT{IO}); # pass both file and dir handles</p>

<p>sub splutter { my $fh = shift; print $fh &quot;her um
well a hmmm0; }</p>

<p>$rec = get_rec(*STDIN); # pass the whole glob $rec =
get_rec(*STDIN{IO}); # pass both file and dir handles</p>

<p>sub get_rec { my $fh = shift; return scalar &lt;$fh&gt;;
}</p>

<p>Using References That s it for creating references. By
now youre probably dying to know how to use references to
get back to your long-lost data. There are several basic
methods.</p>

<p>1. Anywhere you d put an identifier (or chain of
identifiers) as part of a variable or subroutine name, you
can replace the identifier with a simple scalar variable
containing a reference of the correct type:</p>

<p>$bar = $$scalarref; push(@$arrayref, $filename);
$$arrayref[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
$$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
&amp;$coderef(1,2,3); print $globref &quot;output0;</p>

<p>Its important to understand that we are specifically not
dereferencing $arrayref[0] or $hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}
there. The dereference of the scalar variable happens before
it does any key lookups. Anything more complicated than a
simple scalar variable must use methods 2 or 3 below.
However, a &quot;simple scalar&quot; includes an identifier
that itself uses method 1 recursively. Therefore, the
following prints &quot;howdy&quot;.</p>

<p>$refrefref = \ print $$$$refrefref;</p>

<p>2. Anywhere you d put an identifier (or chain of
identifiers) as part of a variable or subroutine name, you
can replace the identifier with a BLOCK returning a
reference of the correct type. In other words, the previous
examples could be written like this:</p>

<p>$bar = ${$scalarref}; push(@{$arrayref}, $filename);
${$arrayref}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
&amp;{$coderef}(1,2,3); $globref-&gt;print(&quot;output0); #
iff IO::Handle is loaded</p>

<p>Admittedly, it s a little silly to use the curlies in
this case, but the BLOCK can contain any arbitrary
expression, in particular, subscripted expressions:</p>

<p>&amp;{ $dispatch{$index} }(1,2,3); # call correct
routine</p>

<p>Because of being able to omit the curlies for the simple
case of $$x, people often make the mistake of viewing the
dereferencing symbols as proper operators, and wonder about
their precedence. If they were, though, you could use
parentheses instead of braces. Thats not the case. Consider
the difference below; case 0 is a short-hand version of case
1, not case 2:</p>

<p>$$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; # CASE 0
${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; # CASE 1
${$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; # CASE 2
${$hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; #
CASE 3</p>

<p>Case 2 is also deceptive in that youre accessing a
variable called %hashref, not dereferencing through $hashref
to the hash its presumably referencing. That would be case
3.</p>

<p>3. Subroutine calls and lookups of individual array
elements arise often enough that it gets cumbersome to use
method 2. As a form of syntactic sugar, the examples for
method 2 may be written:</p>

<p>$arrayref-&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;; # Array element
$hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; # Hash
element $coderef-&gt;(1,2,3); # Subroutine call</p>

<p>The left side of the arrow can be any expression
returning a reference, including a previous dereference.
Note that $array[$x] is not the same thing as
&quot;$array-&gt;[$x]&quot; here:</p>

<p>$array[$x]-&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}-&gt;[0] =
&quot;January&quot;;</p>

<p>This is one of the cases we mentioned earlier in which
references could spring into existence when in an lvalue
context. Before this statement, $array[$x] may have been
undefined. If so, its automatically defined with a hash
reference so that we can look up
&quot;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot; in it. Likewise
&quot;$array[$x]-&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot; will
automatically get defined with an array reference so that we
can look up &quot;[0]&quot; in it. This process is called
autovivification.</p>

<p>One more thing here. The arrow is optional between
brackets subscripts, so you can shrink the above down to</p>

<p>$array[$x]{&quot;foo&quot;}[0] =
&quot;January&quot;;</p>

<p>Which, in the degenerate case of using only ordinary
arrays, gives you multidimensional arrays just like Cs:</p>

<p>$score[$x][$y][$z] += 42;</p>

<p>Well, okay, not entirely like Cs arrays, actually. C
doesnt know how to grow its arrays on demand. Perl does.</p>

<p>4. If a reference happens to be a reference to an
object, then there are probably methods to access the things
referred to, and you should probably stick to those methods
unless youre in the class package that defines the objects
methods. In other words, be nice, and don t violate the
objects encapsulation without a very good reason. Perl does
not enforce encapsulation. We are not totalitarians here. We
do expect some basic civility though.</p>

<p>Using a string or number as a reference produces a
symbolic reference, as explained above. Using a reference as
a number produces an integer representing its storage
location in memory. The only useful thing to be done with
this is to compare two references numerically to see whether
they refer to the same location.</p>

<p>if ($ref1 == $ref2) { # cheap numeric compare of
references print &quot;refs 1 and 2 refer to the same
thing0; }</p>

<p>Using a reference as a string produces both its
referents type, including any package blessing as described
in perlobj, as well as the numeric address expressed in hex.
The ref() operator returns just the type of thing the
reference is pointing to, without the address. See
&quot;ref&quot; in perlfunc for details and examples of its
use.</p>

<p>The bless() operator may be used to associate the object
a reference points to with a package functioning as an
object class. See perlobj.</p>

<p>A typeglob may be dereferenced the same way a reference
can, because the dereference syntax always indicates the
type of reference desired. So &quot;${*foo}&quot; and
&quot;${oo}&quot; both indicate the same scalar
variable.</p>

<p>Heres a trick for interpolating a subroutine call into a
string:</p>

<p>print &quot;My sub returned @{[mysub(1,2,3)]} that
time.0;</p>

<p>The way it works is that when the &quot;@{...}&quot; is
seen in the double-quoted string, its evaluated as a block.
The block creates a reference to an anonymous array
containing the results of the call to
&quot;mysub(1,2,3)&quot;. So the whole block returns a
reference to an array, which is then dereferenced by
&quot;@{...}&quot; and stuck into the double-quoted string.
This chicanery is also useful for arbitrary expressions:</p>

<p>print &quot;That yields @{[$n + 5]} widgets0;</p>

<p>Similarly, an expression that returns a reference to a
scalar can be dereferenced via &quot;${...}&quot;. Thus, the
above expression may be written as:</p>

<p>print &quot;That yields ${ + 5)} widgets0;</p>

<p>Symbolic references We said that references spring into
existence as necessary if they are undefined, but we didnt
say what happens if a value used as a reference is already
defined, but isnt a hard reference. If you use it as a
reference, it ll be treated as a symbolic reference. That
is, the value of the scalar is taken to be the name of a
variable, rather than a direct link to a (possibly)
anonymous value.</p>

<p>People frequently expect it to work like this. So it
does.</p>

<p>$name = &quot;foo&quot;; $$name = 1; # Sets $foo
${$name} = 2; # Sets $foo ${$name x 2} = 3; # Sets $foofoo
$name-&gt;[0] = 4; # Sets $foo[0] @$name = (); # Clears @foo
&amp;$name(); # Calls &amp;foo() (as in Perl 4) $pack =
&quot;THAT&quot;; ${&quot;${pack}::$name&quot;} = 5; # Sets
$THAT::foo without eval</p>

<p>This is powerful, and slightly dangerous, in that it s
possible to intend (with the utmost sincerity) to use a hard
reference, and accidentally use a symbolic reference
instead. To protect against that, you can say</p>

<p>use strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;;</p>

<p>and then only hard references will be allowed for the
rest of the enclosing block. An inner block may countermand
that with</p>

<p>no strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Only package variables (globals, even if localized) are
visible to symbolic references. Lexical variables (declared
with my()) arent in a symbol table, and thus are invisible
to this mechanism. For example:</p>

<p>local $value = 10; $ref = &quot;value&quot;; { my $value
= 20; print $$ref; }</p>

<p>This will still print 10, not 20. Remember that local()
affects package variables, which are all &quot;global&quot;
to the package.</p>

<p>Not-so-symbolic references A new feature contributing to
readability in perl version 5.001 is that the brackets
around a symbolic reference behave more like quotes, just as
they always have within a string. That is,</p>

<p>$push = &quot;pop on &quot;; print
&quot;${push}over&quot;;</p>

<p>has always meant to print &quot;pop on over&quot;, even
though push is a reserved word. This has been generalized to
work the same outside of quotes, so that</p>

<p>print ${push} . &quot;over&quot;;</p>

<p>and even</p>

<p>print ${ push } . &quot;over&quot;;</p>

<p>will have the same effect. (This would have been a
syntax error in Perl 5.000, though Perl 4 allowed it in the
spaceless form.) This construct is not considered to be a
symbolic reference when youre using strict refs:</p>

<p>use strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;; ${ bareword }; # Okay,
means $bareword. ${ &quot;bareword&quot; }; # Error,
symbolic reference.</p>

<p>Similarly, because of all the subscripting that is done
using single words, weve applied the same rule to any
bareword that is used for subscripting a hash. So now,
instead of writing</p>

<p>$array{ &quot;aaa&quot; }{ &quot;bbb&quot; }{
&quot;ccc&quot; }</p>

<p>you can write just</p>

<p>$array{ aaa }{ bbb }{ ccc }</p>

<p>and not worry about whether the subscripts are reserved
words. In the rare event that you do wish to do something
like</p>

<p>$array{ shift }</p>

<p>you can force interpretation as a reserved word by
adding anything that makes it more than a bareword:</p>

<p>$array{ shift() } $array{ +shift } $array{ shift @_
}</p>

<p>The &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma or the -w switch
will warn you if it interprets a reserved word as a string.
But it will no longer warn you about using lowercase words,
because the string is effectively quoted.</p>

<p>Pseudo-hashes: Using an array as a hash Pseudo-hashes
have been removed from Perl. The fields pragma remains
available.</p>

<p>Function Templates As explained above, an anonymous
function with access to the lexical variables visible when
that function was compiled, creates a closure. It retains
access to those variables even though it doesnt get run
until later, such as in a signal handler or a Tk
callback.</p>

<p>Using a closure as a function template allows us to
generate many functions that act similarly. Suppose you
wanted functions named after the colors that generated HTML
font changes for the various colors:</p>

<p>print &quot;Be &quot;, red(&quot;careful&quot;),
&quot;with that &quot;, green(&quot;light&quot;);</p>

<p>The red() and green() functions would be similar. To
create these, well assign a closure to a typeglob of the
name of the function were trying to build.</p>

<p>@colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple
violet); for my $name (@colors) { no strict
&rsquo;refs&rsquo;; # allow symbol table manipulation *$name
= *{uc $name} = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT
COLOR=&rsquo;$name&rsquo;&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; }; }</p>

<p>Now all those different functions appear to exist
independently. You can call red(), RED(), blue(), BLUE(),
green(), etc. This technique saves on both compile time and
memory use, and is less error-prone as well, since syntax
checks happen at compile time. Its critical that any
variables in the anonymous subroutine be lexicals in order
to create a proper closure. Thats the reasons for the
&quot;my&quot; on the loop iteration variable.</p>

<p>This is one of the only places where giving a prototype
to a closure makes much sense. If you wanted to impose
scalar context on the arguments of these functions (probably
not a wise idea for this particular example), you could have
written it this way instead:</p>

<p>*$name = sub ($) { &quot;&lt;FONT
COLOR=&rsquo;$name&rsquo;&gt;$_[0]&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };</p>

<p>However, since prototype checking happens at compile
time, the assignment above happens too late to be of much
use. You could address this by putting the whole loop of
assignments within a BEGIN block, forcing it to occur during
compilation.</p>

<p>Access to lexicals that change over time--like those in
the &quot;for&quot; loop above, basically aliases to
elements from the surrounding lexical scopes-- only works
with anonymous subs, not with named subroutines. Generally
said, named subroutines do not nest properly and should only
be declared in the main package scope.</p>

<p>This is because named subroutines are created at compile
time so their lexical variables get assigned to the parent
lexicals from the first execution of the parent block. If a
parent scope is entered a second time, its lexicals are
created again, while the nested subs still reference the old
ones.</p>

<p>Anonymous subroutines get to capture each time you
execute the &quot;sub&quot; operator, as they are created on
the fly. If you are accustomed to using nested subroutines
in other programming languages with their own private
variables, youll have to work at it a bit in Perl. The
intuitive coding of this type of thing incurs mysterious
warnings about &quot;will not stay shared&quot; due to the
reasons explained above. For example, this wont work:</p>

<p>sub outer { my $x = $_[0] + 35; sub inner { return $x *
19 } # WRONG return $x + inner(); }</p>

<p>A work-around is the following:</p>

<p>sub outer { my $x = $_[0] + 35; local *inner = sub {
return $x * 19 }; return $x + inner(); }</p>

<p>Now inner() can only be called from within outer(),
because of the temporary assignments of the anonymous
subroutine. But when it does, it has normal access to the
lexical variable $x from the scope of outer() at the time
outer is invoked.</p>

<p>This has the interesting effect of creating a function
local to another function, something not normally supported
in Perl.</p>

<p>WARNING You may not (usefully) use a reference as the
key to a hash. It will be converted into a string:</p>

<p>$x{ } = $a;</p>

<p>If you try to dereference the key, it wont do a hard
dereference, and you wont accomplish what youre attempting.
You might want to do something more like</p>

<p>$r = @a; $x{ $r } = $r;</p>

<p>And then at least you can use the values(), which will
be real refs, instead of the keys(), which wont.</p>

<p>The standard Tie::RefHash module provides a convenient
workaround to this.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO Besides the obvious documents, source code can
be instructive. Some pathological examples of the use of
references can be found in the t/op/ref.t regression test in
the Perl source directory.</p>

<p>See also perldsc and perllol for how to use references
to create complex data structures, and perltoot, perlobj,
and perlbot for how to use them to create objects.</p>
