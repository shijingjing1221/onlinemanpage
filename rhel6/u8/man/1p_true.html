<p>TRUE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TRUE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME true - return true value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS true</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The true utility shall return with exit code
zero.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS None.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR Not used.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Zero.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS None.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This utility is typically used in
shell scripts, as shown in the EXAM- PLES section. The
special built-in utility : is sometimes more effi- cient
than true.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This command is executed forever:</p>

<p>while true do command done</p>

<p>RATIONALE The true utility has been retained in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, even though the shell
special built-in : provides similar functionality, because
true is widely used in historical scripts and is less
cryptic to novice script readers.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO false, Shell Commands</p>
