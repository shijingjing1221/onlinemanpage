<p>CHROOT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual CHROOT(2)</p>

<p>NAME chroot - change root directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int chroot(const char *path);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chroot() changes the root directory of the
calling process to that specified in path. This directory
will be used for pathnames beginning with /. The root
directory is inherited by all children of the calling
process.</p>

<p>Only a privileged process (Linux: one with the
CAP_SYS_CHROOT capabil- ity) may call chroot().</p>

<p>This call changes an ingredient in the pathname
resolution process and does nothing else.</p>

<p>This call does not change the current working directory,
so that after the call &rsquo;.&rsquo; can be outside the
tree rooted at &rsquo;/&rsquo;. In particular, the superuser
can escape from a &quot;chroot jail&quot; by doing:</p>

<p>mkdir foo; chroot foo; cd ..</p>

<p>This call does not close open file descriptors, and such
file descrip- tors may allow access to files outside the
chroot tree.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS Depending on the file system, other errors can be
returned. The more general errors are listed below:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix. (See also path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EFAULT path points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving path.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG path is too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of path is not a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller has insufficient privilege.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, SUSv2 (marked LEGACY). This
function is not part of POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES A child process created via fork(2) inherits its
parents root direc- tory. The root directory is left
unchanged by execve(2).</p>

<p>FreeBSD has a stronger jail() system call.</p>
