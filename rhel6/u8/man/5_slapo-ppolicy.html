<p>NAME slapo-ppolicy - Password Policy overlay to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ppolicy overlay is an implementation of
the most recent IETF Pass- word Policy proposal for LDAP.
When instantiated, it intercepts, decodes and applies
specific password policy controls to overall use of a
backend database, changes to user password fields, etc.</p>

<p>The overlay provides a variety of password control
mechanisms. They include password aging -- both minimum and
maximum ages, password reuse and duplication control,
account time-outs, mandatory password resets, acceptable
password content, and even grace logins. Different groups of
users may be associated with different password policies,
and there is no limit to the number of password policies
that may be created.</p>

<p>Note that some of the policies do not take effect when
the operation is performed with the rootdn identity; all the
operations, when performed with any other identity, may be
subjected to constraints, like access control.</p>

<p>Note that the IETF Password Policy proposal for LDAP
makes sense when considering a single-valued password
attribute, while the userPassword attribute allows multiple
values. This implementation enforces a sin- gle value for
the userPassword attribute, despite its specification.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION These slapd.conf configuration options
apply to the ppolicy overlay. They should appear after the
overlay directive.</p>

<p>ppolicy_default &lt;policyDN&gt; Specify the DN of the
pwdPolicy object to use when no specific policy is set on a
given users entry. If there is no specific policy for an
entry and no default is given, then no policies will be
enforced.</p>

<p>ppolicy_forward_updates Specify that policy state
changes that result from Bind opera- tions (such as
recording failures, lockout, etc.) on a consumer should be
forwarded to a master instead of being written directly into
the consumers local database. This setting is only useful on
a replication consumer, and also requires the updateref
setting and chain overlay to be appropriately config-
ured.</p>

<p>ppolicy_hash_cleartext Specify that cleartext passwords
present in Add and Modify requests should be hashed before
being stored in the database. This violates the X.500/LDAP
information model, but may be needed to compensate for LDAP
clients that dont use the Pass- word Modify extended
operation to manage passwords. It is rec- ommended that when
this option is used that compare, search, and read access be
denied to all directory users.</p>

<p>ppolicy_use_lockout A client will always receive an LDAP
InvalidCredentials response when Binding to a locked
account. By default, when a Password Policy control was
provided on the Bind request, a Password Policy response
will be included with no special error code set. This option
changes the Password Policy response to include the
AccountLocked error code. Note that sending the
AccountLocked error code provides useful information to an
attacker; sites that are sensitive to security issues should
not enable this option.</p>

<p>OBJECT CLASS The ppolicy overlay depends on the
pwdPolicy object class. The defini- tion of that class is as
follows:</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.2.1 NAME pwdPolicy AUXILIARY SUP
top MUST ( pwdAttribute ) MAY ( pwdMinAge $ pwdMaxAge $
pwdInHistory $ pwdCheckQuality $ pwdMinLength $
pwdExpireWarning $ pwdGraceAuthnLimit $ pwdLockout $
pwdLockoutDuration $ pwdMaxFailure $ pwdFailureCountInterval
$ pwdMustChange $ pwdAllowUserChange $ pwdSafeModify ) )</p>

<p>This implementation also provides an additional
pwdPolicyChecker objectclass, used for password quality
checking (see below).</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4754.2.99.1 NAME pwdPolicyChecker
AUXILIARY SUP top MAY ( pwdCheckModule ) )</p>

<p>Every account that should be subject to password policy
control should have a pwdPolicySubentry attribute containing
the DN of a valid pwdPol- icy entry, or they can simply use
the configured default. In this way different users may be
managed according to different policies.</p>

<p>OBJECT CLASS ATTRIBUTES Each one of the sections below
details the meaning and use of a partic- ular attribute of
this pwdPolicy object class.</p>

<p>pwdAttribute</p>

<p>This attribute contains the name of the attribute to
which the password policy is applied. For example, the
password policy may be applied to the userPassword
attribute.</p>

<p>Note: in this implementation, the only value accepted
for pwdAttribute is userPassword .</p>

objectIdentifierMatch SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
)</p>

<p>pwdMinAge</p>

<p>This attribute contains the number of seconds that must
elapse between modifications allowed to the password. If
this attribute is not present, zero seconds is assumed (i.e.
the password may be modified whenever and however often is
desired).</p>

SINGLE-VALUE )</p>

<p>pwdMaxAge</p>

<p>This attribute contains the number of seconds after
which a modified password will expire. If this attribute is
not present, or if its value is zero (0), then passwords
will not expire.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.1.3 NAME pwdMaxAge EQUALITY
integerMatch SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
SINGLE-VALUE )</p>

<p>pwdInHistory</p>

<p>This attribute is used to specify the maximum number of
used passwords that will be stored in the pwdHistory
attribute. If the pwdInHistory attribute is not present, or
if its value is zero (0), used passwords will not be stored
in pwdHistory and thus any previously-used password may be
reused. No history checking occurs if the password is being
modified by the rootdn, although the password is saved in
the history.</p>

<p>( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.1.4 NAME pwdInHistory EQUALITY
integerMatch SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
SINGLE-VALUE )</p>

<p>pwdCheckQuality</p>

<p>This attribute indicates if and how password syntax will
be checked while a password is being modified or added. If
this attribute is not present, or its value is zero (0), no
syntax checking will be done. If its value is one (1), the
server will check the syntax, and if the server is unable to
check the syntax, whether due to a client-side hashed
password or some other reason, it will be accepted. If its
value is two (2), the server will check the syntax, and if
the server is unable to check the syntax it will return an
error refusing the pass- word.</p>

EQUALITY integerMatch SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
SINGLE-VALUE )</p>

<p>pwdMinLength</p>

<p>When syntax checking is enabled (see also the
pwdCheckQuality attribute), this attribute contains the
minimum number of characters that will be accepted in a
password. If this attribute is not present, minimum password
length is not enforced. If the server is unable to check the
length of the password, whether due to a client-side hashed
password or some other reason, the server will, depending on
the value of pwdCheckQuality, either accept the password
without checking it (if pwdCheckQuality is zero (0) or one
(1)) or refuse it (if pwdCheckQual- ity is two (2)).</p>

<p>pwdExpireWarning</p>

<p>This attribute contains the maximum number of seconds
before a password is due to expire that expiration warning
messages will be returned to a user who is authenticating to
the directory. If this attribute is not present, or if the
value is zero (0), no warnings will be sent.</p>

<p>pwdGraceAuthnLimit</p>

<p>This attribute contains the number of times that an
expired password may be used to authenticate a user to the
directory. If this attribute is not present or if its value
is zero (0), users with expired pass- words will not be
allowed to authenticate to the directory.</p>

<p>pwdLockout</p>

<p>This attribute specifies the action that should be taken
by the direc- tory when a user has made a number of failed
attempts to authenticate to the directory. If pwdLockout is
set (its value is &quot;TRUE&quot;), the user will not be
allowed to attempt to authenticate to the directory after
there have been a specified number of consecutive failed
bind attempts. The maximum number of consecutive failed bind
attempts allowed is spec- ified by the pwdMaxFailure
attribute. If pwdLockout is not present, or if its value is
&quot;FALSE&quot;, the password may be used to authenticate
no matter how many consecutive failed bind attempts have
been made.</p>

<p>pwdLockoutDuration</p>

<p>This attribute contains the number of seconds during
which the password cannot be used to authenticate the user
to the directory due to too many consecutive failed bind
attempts. (See also pwdLockout and pwd- MaxFailure.) If
pwdLockoutDuration is not present, or if its value is zero
(0), the password cannot be used to authenticate the user to
the directory again until it is reset by an
administrator.</p>

<p>pwdMaxFailure</p>

<p>This attribute contains the number of consecutive failed
bind attempts after which the password may not be used to
authenticate a user to the directory. If pwdMaxFailure is
not present, or its value is zero (0), then a user will be
allowed to continue to attempt to authenticate to the
directory, no matter how many consecutive failed bind
attempts have occurred with that users DN. (See also
pwdLockout and pwdLockoutDura- tion.)</p>

<p>pwdFailureCountInterval</p>

<p>This attribute contains the number of seconds after
which old consecu- tive failed bind attempts are purged from
the failure counter, even though no successful
authentication has occurred. If pwdFailure- CountInterval is
not present, or its value is zero (0), the failure counter
will only be reset by a successful authentication.</p>

<p>pwdMustChange</p>

<p>This attribute specifies whether users must change their
passwords when they first bind to the directory after a
password is set or reset by the administrator, or not. If
pwdMustChange has a value of &quot;TRUE&quot;, users must
change their passwords when they first bind to the directory
after a password is set or reset by the administrator. If
pwd- MustChange is not present, or its value is
&quot;FALSE&quot;, users are not required to change their
password upon binding after the administrator sets or resets
the password.</p>

booleanMatch SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7

<p>pwdAllowUserChange</p>

<p>This attribute specifies whether users are allowed to
change their own passwords or not. If pwdAllowUserChange is
set to &quot;TRUE&quot;, or if the attribute is not present,
users will be allowed to change their own passwords. If its
value is &quot;FALSE&quot;, users will not be allowed to
change their own passwords.</p>

<p>Note: this implies that when pwdAllowUserChange is set
to &quot;TRUE&quot;, users will still be able to change the
password of another user, subjected to access control. This
restriction only applies to modifications of oness own
password. It should also be noted that pwdAllowUserChange
was defined in the specification to provide rough access
control to the password attribute in implementations that do
not allow fine-grain access control. Since OpenLDAP provides
fine-grain access control, the use of this attribute is
discouraged; ACLs should be used instead (see
slapd.access(5) for details).</p>

<p>pwdSafeModify</p>

<p>This attribute denotes whether the users existing
password must be sent along with their new password when
changing a password. If pwd- SafeModify is set to
&quot;TRUE&quot;, the existing password must be sent along
with the new password. If the attribute is not present, or
its value is &quot;FALSE&quot;, the existing password need
not be sent along with the new password.</p>

<p>pwdCheckModule</p>

<p>This attribute names a user-defined loadable module that
must instanti- ate the check_password() function. This
function will be called to further check a new password if
pwdCheckQuality is set to one (1) or two (2), after all of
the built-in password compliance checks have been passed.
This function will be called according to this function
proto- type: int check_password (char *pPasswd, char
**ppErrStr, Entry *pEntry); The pPasswd parameter contains
the clear-text user password, the ppErrStr parameter
contains a double pointer that allows the function to return
human-readable details about any error it encounters. The
optional pEntry parameter, if non-NULL, carries a pointer to
the entry whose password is being checked. If ppErrStr is
NULL, then funcName must NOT attempt to use it/them. A
return value of LDAP_SUCCESS from the called function
indicates that the password is ok, any other value indicates
that the password is unacceptable. If the password is unac-
ceptable, the server will return an error to the client, and
ppErrStr may be used to return a human-readable textual
explanation of the error. The error string must be
dynamically allocated as it will be free()d by slapd.</p>

<p>Note: The user-defined loadable module named by
pwdCheckModule must be in slaps standard executable search
PATH.</p>

<p>Note: pwdCheckModule is a non-standard extension to the
LDAP password policy proposal.</p>

<p>OPERATIONAL ATTRIBUTES The operational attributes used
by the ppolicy module are stored in the users entry. Most of
these attributes are not intended to be changed directly by
users; they are there to track user activity. They have been
detailed here so that administrators and users can both
understand the workings of the ppolicy module.</p>

<p>Note that the current IETF Password Policy proposal does
not define how these operational attributes are expected to
behave in a replication environment. In general,
authentication attempts on a slave server only affect the
copy of the operational attributes on that slave and will
not affect any attributes for a users entry on the master
server. Operational attribute changes resulting from
authentication attempts on a master server will usually
replicate to the slaves (and also over- write any changes
that originated on the slave). These behaviors are not
guaranteed and are subject to change when a formal
specification emerges.</p>

<p>userPassword</p>

<p>The userPassword attribute is not strictly part of the
ppolicy module. It is, however, the attribute that is
tracked and controlled by the module. Please refer to the
standard OpenLDAP schema for its defini- tion.</p>

<p>pwdPolicySubentry</p>

<p>This attribute refers directly to the pwdPolicy subentry
that is to be used for this particular directory user. If
pwdPolicySubentry exists, it must contain the DN of a valid
pwdPolicy object. If it does not exist, the ppolicy module
will enforce the default password policy rules on the user
associated with this authenticating DN. If there is no
default, or the referenced subentry does not exist, then no
policy rules will be enforced.</p>

<p>pwdChangedTime</p>

<p>This attribute denotes the last time that the entrys
password was changed. This value is used by the password
expiration policy to determine whether the password is too
old to be allowed to be used for user authentication. If
pwdChangedTime does not exist, the users password will not
expire.</p>

<p>pwdAccountLockedTime</p>

<p>This attribute contains the time that the users account
was locked. If the account has been locked, the password may
no longer be used to authenticate the user to the directory.
If pwdAccountLockedTime is set to 000001010000Z, the users
account has been permanently locked and may only be unlocked
by an administrator. Note that account locking only takes
effect when the pwdLockout password policy attribute is set
to &quot;TRUE&quot;.</p>

<p>pwdFailureTime</p>

<p>This attribute contains the timestamps of each of the
consecutive authentication failures made upon attempted
authentication to this DN (i.e. account). If too many
timestamps accumulate here (refer to the pwdMaxFailure
password policy attribute for details), and the pwdLock- out
password policy attribute is set to &quot;TRUE&quot;, the
account may be locked. (Please also refer to the pwdLockout
password policy attribute.) Excess timestamps beyond those
allowed by pwdMaxFailure may also be purged. If a successful
authentication is made to this DN (i.e. to this user
account), then pwdFailureTime will be cleansed of
entries.</p>

<p>pwdHistory</p>

<p>This attribute contains the history of previously used
passwords for this DN (i.e. for this user account). The
values of this attribute are stored in string format as
follows:</p>

<p>pwdHistory= time &quot;#&quot; syntaxOID &quot;#&quot;
length &quot;#&quot; data</p>

<p>time= GeneralizedTime as specified in section 3.3.13 of
[RFC4517]</p>

<p>syntaxOID = numericoid This is the string representation
of the dotted-decimal OID that defines the syntax used to
store the password. numericoid is described in section 1.4
of [RFC4512].</p>

<p>length = NumericString The number of octets in the data.
NumericString is described in section 3.3.23 of
[RFC4517].</p>

<p>data = Octets representing the password in the format
specified by syntaxOID.</p>

<p>This format allows the server to store and transmit a
history of pass- words that have been used. In order for
equality matching on the val- ues in this attribute to
function properly, the time field is in GMT format.</p>

used (please refer to the pwdGraceLoginLimit password policy
attribute), then the DN will no longer be allowed to be used
