<p>LDAP_GET_OPTION(3) LDAP_GET_OPTION(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_get_option, ldap_set_option - LDAP option
handling routines</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_get_option(LDAP *ld, int option, void
*outvalue);</p>

<p>int ldap_set_option(LDAP *ld, int option, const void
*invalue);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These routines provide access to options
stored either in a LDAP handle or as global options, where
applicable. They make use of a neutral interface, where the
type of the value either retrieved by ldap_get_option(3) or
set by ldap_set_option(3) is cast to void *. The actual type
is determined based on the value of the option argument.
Global options are set/retrieved by passing a NULL LDAP
handle. LDAP handles inherit their default settings from the
global options in effect at the time the handle is
created.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_API_FEATURE_INFO Fills-in a LDAPAPIFeatureInfo;
outvalue must be a LDAPAPIFea- tureInfo *, pointing to an
already allocated struct. This is a read-only option.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_API_INFO Fills-in a LDAPAPIInfo; outvalue must
be a LDAPAPIInfo *, point- ing to an already allocated
struct. This is a read-only option.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_CLIENT_CONTROLS Sets/gets the client-side
controls to be used for all opera- tions. This is now
deprecated as modern LDAP C API provides replacements for
all main operations which accepts client-side controls as
explicit arguments; see for example ldap_search_ext(3),
ldap_add_ext(3), ldap_modify_ext(3) and so on. outvalue must
be LDAPControl ***, and the caller is respon- sible of
freeing the returned controls, if any, by calling
ldap_controls_free(3), while invalue must be LDAPControl
*const *; the library duplicates the controls passed via
invalue.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_CONNECT_ASYNC Sets/gets the status of the
asynchronous connect flag. invalue should either be
LDAP_OPT_OFF or LDAP_OPT_ON; outvalue must be int *. When
set, the library will call connect(2) and return, without
waiting for response. This leaves the handle in a con-
necting state. Subsequent calls to library routines will
poll for completion of the connect before performing further
opera- tions. As a consequence, library calls that need to
establish a connection with a DSA do not block even for the
network timeout (option LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT). This
option is OpenLDAP spe- cific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_CONNECT_CB This option allows to set a connect
callback. invalue must be a const struct ldap_conncb *.
Callbacks are executed in last in- first served order.
Handle-specific callbacks are executed first, followed by
global ones. Right before freeing the call- back structure,
the lc_del callback handler is passed a NULL Sockbuf.
Calling ldap_get_option(3) for this option removes the
callback whose pointer matches outvalue. This option is
OpenL- DAP specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL Sets/gets the debug level of the
client library. invalue must be a const int *; outvalue must
be a int *. Valid debug levels are LDAP_DEBUG_ANY,
LDAP_DEBUG_ARGS, LDAP_DEBUG_BER, LDAP_DEBUG_CONNS,
LDAP_DEBUG_NONE, LDAP_DEBUG_PACKETS, LDAP_DEBUG_PARSE, and
LDAP_DEBUG_TRACE. This option is OpenLDAP specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_DEFBASE Sets/gets a string containing the DN to
be used as default base for search operations. outvalue must
be a char **, and the caller is responsible of freeing the
returned string by calling ldap_memfree(3), while invalue
must be a const char *; the library duplicates the
corresponding string. This option is OpenLDAP specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_DEREF Sets/gets the value that defines when
alias dereferencing must occur. invalue must be const int *;
outvalue must be int *. They cannot be NULL. The value of
*invalue should be one of LDAP_DEREF_NEVER (the default),
LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING, LDAP_DEREF_FINDING, or
LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS. Note that this has ever been the only
means to determine alias dereferencing within search
operations.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_DESC Returns the file descriptor associated to
the socket buffer of the LDAP handle passed in as ld;
outvalue must be a int *. This is a read-only,
handle-specific option.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_DIAGNOSTIC_MESSAGE Sets/gets a string
containing the error string associated to the LDAP handle.
This option was formerly known as LDAP_OPT_ERROR_STRING.
outvalue must be a char **, and the caller is responsible of
freeing the returned string by calling ldap_memfree(3),
while invalue must be a char *; the library duplicates the
corresponding string.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_HOST_NAME Sets/gets a space-separated list of
hosts to be contacted by the library when trying to
establish a connection. This is now dep- recated in favor of
LDAP_OPT_URI. outvalue must be a char **, and the caller is
responsible of freeing the resulting string by calling
ldap_memfree(3), while invalue must be a const char *; the
library duplicates the corresponding string.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_MATCHED_DN Sets/gets a string containing the
matched DN associated to the LDAP handle. outvalue must be a
char **, and the caller is responsible of freeing the
returned string by calling ldap_mem- free(3), while invalue
must be a const char *; the library duplicates the
corresponding string.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT Sets/gets the network timeout
value after which poll(2)/select(2) following a connect(2)
returns in case of no activity. outvalue must be a struct
timeval ** (the caller has to free *outvalue), and invalue
must be a const struct timeval *. They cannot be NULL. Using
a struct with seconds set to -1 results in an infinite
timeout, which is the default. This option is OpenLDAP
specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION Sets/gets the protocol
version. outvalue and invalue must be int *.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_REFERRAL_URLS Sets/gets an array containing the
referral URIs associated to the LDAP handle. outvalue must
be a char ***, and the caller is responsible of freeing the
returned string by calling ldap_memvfree(3), while invalue
must be a NULL-terminated char *const *; the library
duplicates the corresponding string. This option is OpenLDAP
specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS Determines whether the library should
implicitly chase referrals or not. invalue must be const int
*; its value should either be LDAP_OPT_OFF or LDAP_OPT_ON.
outvalue must be int *.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_RESTART Determines whether the library should
implicitly restart connec- tions (FIXME). invalue must be
const int *; its value should either be LDAP_OPT_OFF or
LDAP_OPT_ON. outvalue must be int *.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_RESULT_CODE Sets/gets the LDAP result code
associated to the handle. This option was formerly known as
LDAP_OPT_ERROR_NUMBER. invalue must be a const int *.
outvalue must be a int *.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_SERVER_CONTROLS Sets/gets the server-side
controls to be used for all opera- tions. This is now
deprecated as modern LDAP C API provides replacements for
all main operations which accepts server-side controls as
explicit arguments; see for example ldap_search_ext(3),
ldap_add_ext(3), ldap_modify_ext(3) and so on. outvalue must
be LDAPControl ***, and the caller is respon- sible of
freeing the returned controls, if any, by calling
ldap_controls_free(3), while invalue must be LDAPControl
*const *; the library duplicates the controls passed via
invalue.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_SESSION_REFCNT Returns the reference count
associated with the LDAP handle passed in as ld; outvalue
must be a int *. This is a read-only, handle-specific
option. This option is OpenLDAP specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_SIZELIMIT Sets/gets the value that defines the
maximum number of entries to be returned by a search
operation. invalue must be const int *, while outvalue must
be int *; They cannot be NULL.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_SOCKBUF Returns a pointer to the socket buffer
of the LDAP handle passed in as ld; outvalue must be a
Sockbuf **. This is a read-only, handle-specific option.
This option is OpenLDAP specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_TIMELIMIT Sets/gets the value that defines the
time limit after which a search operation should be
terminated by the server. invalue must be const int *, while
outvalue must be int *, and they can- not be NULL.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_TIMEOUT Sets/gets a timeout value for the
synchronous API calls. out- value must be a struct timeval
** (the caller has to free *out- value), and invalue must be
a struct timeval *, and they cannot be NULL. Using a struct
with seconds set to -1 results in an infinite timeout, which
is the default. This option is OpenLDAP specific.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_URI Sets/gets a comma- or space-separated list
of URIs to be con- tacted by the library when trying to
establish a connection. outvalue must be a char **, and the
caller is responsible of freeing the resulting string by
calling ldap_memfree(3), while invalue must be a const char
*; the library parses the string into a list of LDAPURLDesc
structures, so the invocation of ldap_set_option(3) may fail
if URL parsing fails. URIs may only contain the schema, the
host, and the port fields. This option is OpenLDAP
specific.</p>

portable.</p>

<p>LDAP_OPT_X_KEEPALIVE_IDLE Sets/gets the number of
seconds a connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts
sending keepalive probes. invalue must be const int *;

<p>LDAP_OPT_X_TLS_SSL_CTX Gets the TLS session context
associated with this handle. out- value must be void **.
When using the OpenSSL library this is an SSL*. When using
other crypto libraries this is a pointer to an OpenLDAP
private structure. Applications generally should not use
this option.</p>

<p>ERRORS On success, the functions return
LDAP_OPT_SUCCESS, while they may return LDAP_OPT_ERROR to
indicate a generic option handling error. Occasionally, more
specific errors can be returned, like LDAP_NO_MEMORY to
indicate a failure in memory allocation.</p>

<p>NOTES The LDAP libraries with the LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS
option set to LDAP_OPT_ON (default value) automatically
follow referrals using an anonymous bind. Application
developers are encouraged to either imple- ment consistent
referral chasing features, or explicitly disable refer- ral
chasing by setting that option to LDAP_OPT_OFF.</p>

<p>The protocol version used by the library defaults to
LDAPv2 (now his- toric), which corresponds to the
LDAP_VERSION2 macro. Application developers are encouraged
to explicitly set LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION to LDAPv3, using
the LDAP_VERSION3 macro, or to allow users to select the
protocol version.</p>
