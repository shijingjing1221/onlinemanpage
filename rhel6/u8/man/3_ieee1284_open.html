<p>NAME ieee1284_open - open a port</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ieee1284.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ieee1284_open(struct parport *port, int flags, int
*capabilities);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In order to begin using a port it must be
opened. Any initial set-up of the port is done at this
stage. When an open port is no longer needed it should be
closed with ieee1284_close(3).</p>

<p>The possible flags are:</p>

<p>F1284_EXCL This device cannot share the port with any
other device. If this is the case it must be declared at
this stage, so that other drivers trying to access the port
know not to bother; otherwise they will wait until this
driver releases the port, i.e. never.</p>

<p>The iopl/dev-port access methods don&acute;t support
this yet, but the ppdev ones do.</p>

<p>If capabilities is not NULL it must point to storage for
an int, which will be treated as a set of flags, one per
bit, which the library sets or clears as appropriate. If a
capability is present it will be used when asked for. They
are:</p>

<p>CAP1284_RAW Pin-level access is available. If this
capability is present then the following functions are
effective: ieee1284_write_data, ieee1284_read_status,
ieee1284_wait_status, ieee1284_write_control,
ieee1284_read_control, ieee1284_frob_control.</p>

<p>CAP1284_NIBBLE There is an implementation of nibble mode
for this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_BYTE There is an implementation of byte mode for
this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_COMPAT There is an implementation of
compatibility mode for this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_ECP There is a hardware implementation of ECP
mode for this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_ECPRLE There is an RLE-aware implementation of
ECP mode for this port (the F1284_RLE flag is recognised by
the ECP transfer functions).</p>

<p>CAP1284_ECPSWE There is a software implementation of ECP
mode for this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_BECP There is an implementation of bounded ECP
mode for this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_EPP There is a hardware implementation of EPP
mode for this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_EPPSWE There is a software implementation of EPP
mode for this port.</p>

<p>CAP1284_IRQ An interrupt line is configured for this
port and interrupt notifications can be received using
ieee1284_get_irq_fd(3).</p>

<p>CAP1284_DMA A DMA channel is configured for this
port.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE E1284_OK The port is now opened.</p>

<p>E1284_INIT There was a problem during port
initialization. This could be because another driver has
opened the port exclusively, or some other reason.</p>

<p>E1284_NOMEM There is not enough memory.</p>

<p>E1284_NOTAVAIL One or more of the supplied flags is not
supported by this type of port.</p>

<p>E1284_INVALIDPORT The port parameter is invalid (for
instance, the port may already be open).</p>

<p>E1284_SYS There was a problem at the operating system
level. The global variable errno has been set
appropriately.</p>
