<p>NAME glutTabletButtonFunc - Sets a tablet button
callback.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutTabletButtonFunc(void( *callback )( int button,
int state, int x, int y ));</p>

<p>PARAMETERS callback Client tablet button hook.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function registers a callback by which
you receive reports a tablet button status feature. Buttons
are reported with button in the range 1 to glutDeviceGet(
GLUT_NUM_TABLET_BUTTONS). state is either GLUT_UP or
GLUT_DOWN and x and y are the tablet coordinate (see
glutTabletMotionFunc() for the bounds of x and y).</p>

<p>The callback is bound to the current window .</p>

<p>CAVEATS OpenGLUT does not implement tablet support.</p>

<p>Buttons are not pressure-sensitive.</p>

<p>TODO We might want to add support for this sooner or
later. Although a tablet could also be generalized as a
mouse. There are relatively cheap AipTek HyperPen tablets,
and slightly less cheap Wacom tablets on many store
shelves.</p>
