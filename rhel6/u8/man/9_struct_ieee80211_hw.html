<p>struct ieee80211_conf, device configuration, don&acute;t
use.</p>

<p>wiphy This points to the struct wiphy allocated for this
802.11 PHY. You must fill in the perm_addr and dev members
of this structure using SET_IEEE80211_DEV and
SET_IEEE80211_PERM_ADDR. Additionally, all supported bands
(with channels, bitrates) are registered here.</p>

<p>rate_control_algorithm rate control algorithm for this
hardware. If unset (NULL), the default algorithm will be
used. Must be set before calling ieee80211_register_hw.</p>

<p>priv pointer to private area that was allocated for
driver use along with this structure.</p>

<p>flags[BITS_TO_LONGS(NUM_IEEE80211_HW_FLAGS)] hardware
flags, see enum ieee80211_hw_flags.</p>

<p>extra_tx_headroom headroom to reserve in each transmit
skb for use by the driver (e.g. for transmit headers.)</p>

<p>extra_beacon_tailroom tailroom to reserve in each beacon
tx skb. Can be used by drivers to add extra IEs.</p>

<p>vif_data_size size (in bytes) of the drv_priv data area
within struct ieee80211_vif.</p>

<p>sta_data_size size (in bytes) of the drv_priv data area
within struct ieee80211_sta.</p>

<p>chanctx_data_size size (in bytes) of the drv_priv data
area within struct ieee80211_chanctx_conf.</p>

<p>txq_data_size size (in bytes) of the drv_priv data area
within struct ieee80211_txq.</p>

<p>queues number of available hardware transmit queues for
data packets. WMM/QoS requires at least four, these queues
need to have configurable access parameters.</p>

<p>max_listen_interval max listen interval in units of
beacon interval that HW supports</p>

<p>max_signal Maximum value for signal (rssi) in RX
information, used only when IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_UNSPEC or
IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_DB</p>

<p>max_rates maximum number of alternate rate retry stages
the hw can handle.</p>

<p>max_report_rates maximum number of alternate rate retry
stages the hw can report back.</p>

<p>max_rate_tries maximum number of tries for each
stage</p>

<p>max_rx_aggregation_subframes maximum buffer size (number
of sub-frames) to be used for A-MPDU block ack receiver
aggregation. This is only relevant if the device has
restrictions on the number of subframes, if it relies on
mac80211 to do reordering it shouldn&acute;t be set.</p>

<p>max_tx_aggregation_subframes maximum number of subframes
in an aggregate an HT driver will transmit, used by the peer
as a hint to size its reorder buffer.</p>

<p>offchannel_tx_hw_queue HW queue ID to use for offchannel
TX (if IEEE80211_HW_QUEUE_CONTROL is set)</p>

<p>radiotap_mcs_details lists which MCS information can the
HW reports, by default it is set to _MCS, _GI and _BW but
doesn&acute;t include _FMT. Use
IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_MCS_HAVE_* values, only adding _BW is
supported today.</p>

<p>radiotap_vht_details lists which VHT MCS information the
HW reports, the default is _GI | _BANDWIDTH. Use the
IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_VHT_KNOWN_* values.</p>

<p>netdev_features netdev features to be set in each netdev
created from this HW. Note that not all features are usable
with mac80211, other features will be rejected during HW
registration.</p>

<p>uapsd_queues This bitmap is included in (re)association
frame to indicate for each access category if it is uAPSD
trigger-enabled and delivery- enabled. Use
IEEE80211_WMM_IE_STA_QOSINFO_AC_* to set this bitmap. Each
bit corresponds to different AC. Value &acute;1&acute; in
specific bit means that corresponding AC is both trigger-
and delivery-enabled. &acute;0&acute; means neither
enabled.</p>

<p>uapsd_max_sp_len maximum number of total buffered frames
the WMM AP may deliver to a WMM STA during any Service
Period triggered by the WMM STA. Use
IEEE80211_WMM_IE_STA_QOSINFO_SP_* for correct values.</p>

<p>n_cipher_schemes a size of an array of cipher schemes
definitions.</p>

<p>cipher_schemes a pointer to an array of cipher scheme
definitions supported by HW.</p>

<p>txq_ac_max_pending maximum number of frames per AC
pending in all txq entries for a vif.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This structure contains the configuration
and hardware information for an 802.11 PHY.</p>
