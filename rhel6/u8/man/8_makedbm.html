<p>NAME makedbm - create or dump a ypserv database file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/lib64/yp/makedbm [ -a | -r ] [ -b ] [ -c ]
[ -s ] [ -l ] [ -i YP_INPUT_NAME ] [ -o YP_OUTPUT_NAME ] [
-m YP_MASTER_NAME ] inputfile dbname /usr/lib64/yp/makedbm
-u dbname /usr/lib64/yp/makedbm -c /usr/lib64/yp/makedbm
--version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION makedbm takes the inputfile and converts it
to a ypserv database file. In the moment, GDBM is used as
database. Each line of the input file is converted to a
single record. All characters up to the first TAB or SPACE
are the key, and the rest of the line is the data. makedbm
does not treat # as a special character.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Special support for mail aliases. We couldnt
use sendmail for it, since sendmail uses db, but ypserv gdbm
as database format.</p>

<p>-b Insert the YP_INTERDOMAIN into the output. This key
causes ypserv(8) to use DNS for host name and address
lookups for hosts not found in the maps.</p>

<p>-c send a YPPROC_CLEAR to the local ypserv(8). This
causes ypserv to invalidate all cached entries.</p>

<p>-l Convert the keys of the given map to lower case.</p>

<p>-i YP_INPUT_NAME Create a special entry with the key
YP_INPUT_NAME.</p>

<p>-m YP_MASTER_NAME Create a special entry with the key
YP_MASTER_NAME. If no mas- ter host name is specified,
YP_MASTER_NAME will be set to the local host name.</p>

<p>-o YP_OUTPUT_NAME Create a special entry with the key
YP_OUTPUT_NAME.</p>

<p>-r Handle # as comment sign and remove the comment.</p>

<p>-s Secure map. Accept connections from secure NIS
networks only (reserved ports).</p>

<p>-u dbname Dump a ypserv database file. Prints out the
file in text format, one entry per line, with a single space
separating keys from values.</p>

<p>--no-limit-check Dont check for NIS key and data
limit.</p>
