<p>CHARSETS(7) Linux Programmer s Manual CHARSETS(7)</p>

<p>NAME charsets - programmer s view of character sets and
internationalization</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux is an international operating system.
Various of its utilities and device drivers (including the
console driver) support multilingual character sets
including Latin-alphabet letters with diacritical marks,
accents, ligatures, and entire non-Latin alphabets including
Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, and Hebrew.</p>

<p>This manual page presents a programmer s-eye view of
different charac- ter-set standards and how they fit
together on Linux. Standards dis- cussed include ASCII, ISO
8859, KOI8-R, Unicode, ISO 2022 and ISO 4873. The primary
emphasis is on character sets actually used as locale char-
acter sets, not the myriad others that can be found in data
from other systems.</p>

<p>A complete list of charsets used in an officially
supported locale in glibc 2.2.3 is:
ISO-8859-{1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,13,15}, CP1251, UTF-8,
EUC-{KR,JP,TW}, KOI8-{R,U}, GB2312, GB18030, GBK, BIG5,
BIG5-HKSCS and TIS-620 (in no particular order.) (Romanian
may be switching to ISO-8859-16.)</p>

<p>The recommended encoding in all settings and locales is
UTF-8.</p>

<p>ASCII ASCII (American Standard Code For Information
Interchange) is the orig- inal 7-bit character set,
originally designed for American English. It is currently
described by the ECMA-6 standard.</p>

<p>Various ASCII variants replacing the dollar sign with
other currency symbols and replacing punctuation with
non-English alphabetic charac- ters to cover German, French,
Spanish and others in 7 bits exist. All are deprecated;
glibc doesn t support locales whose character sets arent
true supersets of ASCII. (These sets are also known as
ISO-646, a close relative of ASCII that permitted replacing
these characters.)</p>

<p>As Linux was written for hardware designed in the US, it
natively sup- ports ASCII.</p>

<p>ISO 8859 ISO 8859 is a series of 15 8-bit character sets
all of which have US ASCII in their low (7-bit) half,
invisible control characters in posi- tions 128 to 159, and
96 fixed-width graphics in positions 160-255.</p>

<p>Of these, the most important is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1). It
is natively supported in the Linux console driver, fairly
well supported in X11R6, and is the base character set of
HTML.</p>

<p>Console support for the other 8859 character sets is
available under Linux through user-mode utilities (such as
setfont(8)) that modify key- board bindings and the EGA
graphics table and employ the &quot;user mapping&quot; font
table in the console driver.</p>

<p>Here are brief descriptions of each set:</p>

<p>8859-1 (Latin-1) Latin-1 covers most Western European
languages such as Albanian, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English,
Faroese, Finnish, French, Ger- man, Galician, Irish,
Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and
Swedish. The lack of the ligatures Dutch ij, French oe and
old-style ,,German quotation marks is considered
tolerable.</p>

<p>8859-2 (Latin-2) Latin-2 supports most Latin-written
Slavic and Central European languages: Croatian, Czech,
German, Hungarian, Polish, Rumanian, Slovak, and
Slovene.</p>

<p>8859-3 (Latin-3) Latin-3 is popular with authors of
Esperanto, Galician, and Mal- tese. (Turkish is now written
with 8859-9 instead.)</p>

<p>8859-4 (Latin-4) Latin-4 introduced letters for
Estonian, Latvian, and Lithua- nian. It is essentially
obsolete; see 8859-10 (Latin-6) and 8859-13 (Latin-7).</p>

<p>8859-5 Cyrillic letters supporting Bulgarian,
Byelorussian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian.
Ukrainians read the letter &quot;ghe&quot; with downstroke
as &quot;heh&quot; and would need a ghe with upstroke to
write a correct ghe. See the discussion of KOI8-R below.</p>

<p>8859-6 Supports Arabic. The 8859-6 glyph table is a
fixed font of sep- arate letter forms, but a proper display
engine should combine these using the proper initial,
medial, and final forms.</p>

<p>8859-7 Supports Modern Greek.</p>

<p>8859-8 Supports modern Hebrew without niqud (punctuation
signs). Niqud and full-fledged Biblical Hebrew are outside
the scope of this character set; under Linux, UTF-8 is the
preferred encoding for these.</p>

<p>8859-9 (Latin-5) This is a variant of Latin-1 that
replaces Icelandic letters with Turkish ones.</p>

<p>8859-10 (Latin-6) Latin 6 adds the last Inuit
(Greenlandic) and Sami (Lappish) letters that were missing
in Latin 4 to cover the entire Nordic area. RFC 1345 listed
a preliminary and different &quot;latin6&quot;. Skolt Sami
still needs a few more accents than these.</p>

<p>8859-11 This only exists as a rejected draft standard.
The draft stan- dard was identical to TIS-620, which is used
under Linux for Thai.</p>

<p>8859-12 This set does not exist. While Vietnamese has
been suggested for this space, it does not fit within the 96
(non-combining) characters ISO 8859 offers. UTF-8 is the
preferred character set for Vietnamese use under Linux.</p>

<p>8859-13 (Latin-7) Supports the Baltic Rim languages; in
particular, it includes Latvian characters not found in
Latin-4.</p>

<p>8859-14 (Latin-8) This is the Celtic character set,
covering Gaelic and Welsh. This charset also contains the
dotted characters needed for Old Irish.</p>

<p>8859-15 (Latin-9) This adds the Euro sign and French and
Finnish letters that were missing in Latin-1.</p>

<p>8859-16 (Latin-10) This set covers many of the languages
covered by 8859-2, and supports Romanian more completely
then that set does.</p>

<p>KOI8-R KOI8-R is a non-ISO character set popular in
Russia. The lower half is US ASCII; the upper is a Cyrillic
character set somewhat better designed than ISO 8859-5.
KOI8-U is a common character set, based off KOI8-R, that has
better support for Ukrainian. Neither of these sets are
ISO-2022 compatible, unlike the ISO-8859 series.</p>

<p>Console support for KOI8-R is available under Linux
through user-mode utilities that modify keyboard bindings
and the EGA graphics table, and employ the &quot;user
mapping&quot; font table in the console driver.</p>

<p>JIS X 0208 JIS X 0208 is a Japanese national standard
character set. Though there are some more Japanese national
standard character sets (like JIS X 0201, JIS X 0212, and
JIS X 0213), this is the most important one. Characters are
mapped into a 94x94 two-byte matrix, whose each byte is in
the range 0x21-0x7e. Note that JIS X 0208 is a character
set, not an encoding. This means that JIS X 0208 itself is
not used for expressing text data. JIS X 0208 is used as a
component to construct encodings such as EUC-JP, Shift_JIS,
and ISO-2022-JP. EUC-JP is the most important encoding for
Linux and includes US ASCII and JIS X 0208. In EUC-JP, JIS X
0208 characters are expressed in two bytes, each of which is
the JIS X 0208 code plus 0x80.</p>

<p>KS X 1001 KS X 1001 is a Korean national standard
character set. Just as JIS X 0208, characters are mapped
into a 94x94 two-byte matrix. KS X 1001 is used like JIS X
0208, as a component to construct encodings such as EUC-KR,
Johab, and ISO-2022-KR. EUC-KR is the most important
encoding for Linux and includes US ASCII and KS X 1001. KS C
5601 is an older name for KS X 1001.</p>

<p>GB 2312 GB 2312 is a mainland Chinese national standard
character set used to express simplified Chinese. Just like
JIS X 0208, characters are mapped into a 94x94 two-byte
matrix used to construct EUC-CN. EUC-CN is the most
important encoding for Linux and includes US ASCII and GB
2312. Note that EUC-CN is often called as GB, GB 2312, or
CN-GB.</p>

<p>Big5 Big5 is a popular character set in Taiwan to
express traditional Chi- nese. (Big5 is both a character set
and an encoding.) It is a super- set of US ASCII. Non-ASCII
characters are expressed in two bytes. Bytes 0xa1-0xfe are
used as leading bytes for two-byte characters. Big5 and its
extension is widely used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is not
ISO 2022-compliant.</p>

<p>TIS 620 TIS 620 is a Thai national standard character
set and a superset of US ASCII. Like ISO 8859 series, Thai
characters are mapped into 0xa1-0xfe. TIS 620 is the only
commonly used character set under Linux besides UTF-8 to
have combining characters.</p>

<p>UNICODE Unicode (ISO 10646) is a standard which aims to
unambiguously represent every character in every human
language. Unicodes structure permits 20.1 bits to encode
every character. Since most computers dont include 20.1-bit
integers, Unicode is usually encoded as 32-bit inte- gers
internally and either a series of 16-bit integers (UTF-16)
(need- ing two 16-bit integers only when encoding certain
rare characters) or a series of 8-bit bytes (UTF-8).
Information on Unicode is available at
&lt;http://www.unicode.org&gt;.</p>

<p>Linux represents Unicode using the 8-bit Unicode
Transformation Format (UTF-8). UTF-8 is a variable length
encoding of Unicode. It uses 1 byte to code 7 bits, 2 bytes
for 11 bits, 3 bytes for 16 bits, 4 bytes for 21 bits, 5
bytes for 26 bits, 6 bytes for 31 bits.</p>

<p>Let 0,1,x stand for a zero, one, or arbitrary bit. A
byte 0xxxxxxx stands for the Unicode 00000000 0xxxxxxx which
codes the same symbol as the ASCII 0xxxxxxx. Thus, ASCII
goes unchanged into UTF-8, and people using only ASCII do
not notice any change: not in code, and not in file
size.</p>

<p>A byte 110xxxxx is the start of a 2-byte code, and
110xxxxx 10yyyyyy is assembled into 00000xxx xxyyyyyy. A
byte 1110xxxx is the start of a 3-byte code, and 1110xxxx
10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz is assembled into xxxxyyyy yyzzzzzz. (When
UTF-8 is used to code the 31-bit ISO 10646 then this
progression continues up to 6-byte codes.)</p>

<p>For most people who use ISO-8859 character sets, this
means that the characters outside of ASCII are now coded
with two bytes. This tends to expand ordinary text files by
only one or two percent. For Russian or Greek users, this
expands ordinary text files by 100%, since text in those
languages is mostly outside of ASCII. For Japanese users
this means that the 16-bit codes now in common use will take
three bytes. While there are algorithmic conversions from
some character sets (esp. ISO-8859-1) to Unicode, general
conversion requires carrying around conversion tables, which
can be quite large for 16-bit codes.</p>

<p>Note that UTF-8 is self-synchronizing: 10xxxxxx is a
tail, any other byte is the head of a code. Note that the
only way ASCII bytes occur in a UTF-8 stream, is as
themselves. In particular, there are no embedded NULs
(&rsquo; &rsquo;) or &rsquo;/&rsquo;s that form part of some
larger code.</p>

<p>Since ASCII, and, in particular, NUL and
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, are unchanged, the kernel does not notice
that UTF-8 is being used. It does not care at all what the
bytes it is handling stand for.</p>

<p>Rendering of Unicode data streams is typically handled
through &quot;sub- font&quot; tables which map a subset of
Unicode to glyphs. Internally the kernel uses Unicode to
describe the subfont loaded in video RAM. This means that in
UTF-8 mode one can use a character set with 512 different
symbols. This is not enough for Japanese, Chinese and
Korean, but it is enough for most other purposes.</p>

<p>At the current time, the console driver does not handle
combining char- acters. So Thai, Sioux and any other script
needing combining charac- ters cant be handled on the
console.</p>

<p>ISO 2022 and ISO 4873 The ISO 2022 and 4873 standards
describe a font-control model based on VT100 practice. This
model is (partially) supported by the Linux ker- nel and by
xterm(1). It is popular in Japan and Korea.</p>

<p>There are 4 graphic character sets, called G0, G1, G2
and G3, and one of them is the current character set for
codes with high bit zero (ini- tially G0), and one of them
is the current character set for codes with high bit one
(initially G1). Each graphic character set has 94 or 96
characters, and is essentially a 7-bit character set. It
uses codes either 040-0177 (041-0176) or 0240-0377
(0241-0376). G0 always has size 94 and uses codes
041-0176.</p>

<p>Switching between character sets is done using the shift
functions ^N (SO or LS1), ^O (SI or LS0), ESC n (LS2), ESC o
(LS3), ESC N (SS2), ESC O (SS3), ESC ~ (LS1R), ESC } (LS2R),
ESC | (LS3R). The function LSn makes character set Gn the
current one for codes with high bit zero. The function LSnR
makes character set Gn the current one for codes with high
bit one. The function SSn makes character set Gn (n=2 or 3)
the current one for the next character only (regardless of
the value of its high order bit).</p>

<p>A 94-character set is designated as Gn character set by
an escape sequence ESC ( xx (for G0), ESC ) xx (for G1), ESC
* xx (for G2), ESC + xx (for G3), where xx is a symbol or a
pair of symbols found in the ISO 2375 International Register
of Coded Character Sets. For example, ESC ( @ selects the
ISO 646 character set as G0, ESC ( A selects the UK standard
character set (with pound instead of number sign), ESC ( B
selects ASCII (with dollar instead of currency sign), ESC (
M selects a character set for African languages, ESC ( ! A
selects the Cuban char- acter set, etc. etc.</p>

<p>A 96-character set is designated as Gn character set by
an escape sequence ESC - xx (for G1), ESC . xx (for G2) or
ESC / xx (for G3). For example, ESC - G selects the Hebrew
alphabet as G1.</p>

<p>A multibyte character set is designated as Gn character
set by an escape sequence ESC $ xx or ESC $ ( xx (for G0),
ESC $ ) xx (for G1), ESC $ * xx (for G2), ESC $ + xx (for
G3). For example, ESC $ ( C selects the Korean character set
for G0. The Japanese character set selected by ESC $ B has a
more recent version selected by ESC &amp; @ ESC $ B.</p>

<p>ISO 4873 stipulates a narrower use of character sets,
where G0 is fixed (always ASCII), so that G1, G2 and G3 can
only be invoked for codes with the high order bit set. In
particular, ^N and ^O are not used anymore, ESC ( xx can be
used only with xx=B, and ESC ) xx, ESC * xx, ESC + xx are
equivalent to ESC - xx, ESC . xx, ESC / xx,
respectively.</p>
