<p>NAME XmClipboardEndCopy A clipboard function that
completes the copying of data to the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardEndCopy (display, window, item_id) Display *
display; Window window; long item_id; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardEndCopy locks the clipboard from
access by other applica- tions, places data in the clipboard
data structure, and unlocks the clipboard. Data items copied
to the clipboard by XmClipboardCopy are not actually entered
in the clipboard data structure until the call to
XmClipboardEndCopy.</p>

<p>This function also frees up temporary storage that was
allocated by XmClipboardStartCopy, which must be called
before XmClipboardEndCopy. The latter function should not be
called if XmClipboardCancelCopy has been called.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
clipboard function it calls.</p>

<p>item_id Specifies the number assigned to this data item,
which was returned by a previous call to
XmClipboardStartCopy.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardFail The function failed because
XmClipboardStartCopy was not called.</p>

<p>RELATED XmClipboardCancelCopy(3), XmClipboardCopy(3) and
XmClipboardStart- Copy(3).</p>
