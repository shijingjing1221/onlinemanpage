<p>NAME keymaps - keyboard table descriptions for loadkeys
and dumpkeys</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These files are used by loadkeys(1) to
modify the translation tables used by the kernel keyboard
driver and generated by dumpkeys(1) from those translation
tables.</p>

<p>The format of these files is vaguely similar to the one
accepted by xmodmap(1). The file consists of charset or key
or string definition lines interspersed with comments.</p>

<p>Comments are introduced with ! or # characters and
continue to the end of the line. Anything following one of
these characters on that line is ignored. Note that comments
need not begin from column one as with xmodmap(1).</p>

<p>The syntax of keymap files is line oriented; a complete
definition must fit on a single logical line. Logical lines
can, however, be split into multiple physical lines by
ending each subline with the backslash char- acter (.</p>

<p>INCLUDE FILES A keymap can include other keymaps using
the syntax</p>

<p>include &quot;pathname&quot;</p>

<p>CHARSET DEFINITIONS A character set definition line is
of the form:</p>

<p>charset &quot;iso-8859-x&quot;</p>

<p>It defines how following keysyms are to be interpreted.
For example, in iso-8859-1 the symbol mu (or micro) has code
0265, while in iso-8859-7 the letter mu has code 0354.</p>

<p>COMPLETE KEYCODE DEFINITIONS Each complete key
definition line is of the form:</p>

<p>keycode keynumber = keysym keysym keysym...</p>

<p>keynumber is the internal identification number of the
key, roughly equivalent to the scan code of it. keynumber
can be given in decimal, octal or hexadecimal notation.
Octal is denoted by a leading zero and hexadecimal by the
prefix 0x.</p>

<p>Each of the keysyms represent keyboard actions, of which
up to 256 can be bound to a single key. The actions
available include outputting character codes or character
sequences, switching consoles or keymaps, booting the
machine etc. (The complete list can be obtained from dump-
keys(1) by saying dumpkeys -l .)</p>

<p>Each keysym may be prefixed by a + (plus sign), in wich
case this keysym is treated as a &quot;letter&quot; and
therefore affected by the &quot;Cap- sLock&quot; the same
way as by &quot;Shift&quot; (to be correct, the CapsLock
inverts the Shift state). The ASCII letters (a-z and A-Z)
are made CapsLockable by default. If Shift+CapsLock should
not produce a lower case symbol, put lines like</p>

<p>keycode 30 = +a A</p>

<p>in the map file.</p>

<p>Which of the actions bound to a given key is taken when
it is pressed depends on what modifiers are in effect at
that moment. The keyboard driver supports 9 modifiers. These
modifiers are labeled (completely arbitrarily) Shift, AltGr,
Control, Alt, ShiftL, ShiftR, CtrlL, CtrlR and CapsShift.
Each of these modifiers has an associated weight of power of
two according to the following table:</p>

<p>modifier weight</p>

<p>Shift 1 AltGr 2 Control 4 Alt 8 ShiftL 16 ShiftR 32
CtrlL 64 CtrlR 128 CapsShift 256</p>

<p>The effective action of a key is found out by adding up
the weights of all the modifiers in effect. By default, no
modifiers are in effect, so action number zero, i.e. the one
in the first column in a key defini- tion line, is taken
when the key is pressed or released. When e.g. Shift and Alt
modifiers are in effect, action number nine (from the 10th
column) is the effective one.</p>

<p>Changing the state of what modifiers are in effect can
be achieved by binding appropriate key actions to desired
keys. For example, binding the symbol Shift to a key sets
the Shift modifier in effect when that key is pressed and
cancels the effect of that modifier when the key is
released. Binding AltGr_Lock to a key sets AltGr in effect
when the key is pressed and cancels the effect when the key
is pressed again. (By default Shift, AltGr, Control and Alt
are bound to the keys that bear a similar label; AltGr may
denote the right Alt key.)</p>

<p>Note that you should be very careful when binding the
modifier keys, otherwise you can end up with an unusable
keyboard mapping. If you for example define a key to have
Control in its first column and leave the rest of the
columns to be VoidSymbols, youre in trouble. This is because
pressing the key puts Control modifier in effect and the
fol- lowing actions are looked up from the fifth column (see
the table above). So, when you release the key, the action
from the fifth column is taken. It has VoidSymbol in it, so
nothing happens. This means that the Control modifier is
still in effect, although you have released the key.
Re-pressing and releasing the key has no effect. To avoid
this, you should always define all the columns to have the
same modifier sym- bol. There is a handy short-hand notation
for this, see below.</p>

<p>keysyms can be given in decimal, octal, hexadecimal,
unicode or sym- bolic notation. The numeric notations use
the same format as with keynumber. Unicode notation is
&quot;U+&quot; followed by four hexadecimal dig- its. The
symbolic notation resembles that used by xmodmap(1). Notable
differences are the number symbols. The numeric symbols 0,
..., 9 of xmodmap(1) are replaced with the corresponding
words zero, one, ... nine to avoid confusion with the
numeric notation.</p>

<p>It should be noted that using numeric notation for the
keysyms is highly unportable as the key action numbers may
vary from one kernel version to another and the use of
numeric notations is thus strongly discouraged. They are
intended to be used only when you know there is a supported
keyboard action in your kernel for which your current
version of loadkeys(1) has no symbolic name.</p>

<p>There is a number of short-hand notations to add
readability and reduce typing work and the probability of
typing-errors.</p>

<p>First of all, you can give a map specification line, of
the form</p>

<p>keymaps 0-2,4-5,8,12</p>

<p>to indicate that the lines of the keymap will not
specify all 256 columns, but only the indicated ones. (In
the example: only the plain, Shift, AltGr, Control,
Control+Shift, Alt and Control+Alt maps, that is, 7 columns
instead of 256.) When no such line is given, the keymaps 0-M
will be defined, where M+1 is the maximum number of entries
found in any definition line.</p>

<p>Next, you can leave off any trailing VoidSymbol entries
from a key def- inition line. VoidSymbol denotes a keyboard
action which produces no output and has no other effects
either. For example, to define key num- ber 30 to output a
unshifted, A when pressed with Shift and do nothing when
pressed with AltGr or other modifiers, you can write</p>

<p>keycode 30 = a A</p>

<p>instead of the more verbose</p>

<p>keycode 30 = a A VoidSymbol VoidSymbol VoidSymbol
VoidSymbol VoidSymbol ...</p>

<p>For added convenience, you can usually get off with
still more terse definitions. If you enter a key definition
line with only and exactly one action code after the equals
sign, it has a special meaning. If the code (numeric or
symbolic) is not an ASCII letter, it means the code is
implicitly replicated through all columns being defined. If,
on the other hand, the action code is an ASCII character in
the range a, ..., z or A, ..., Z in the ASCII collating
sequence, the follow- ing definitions are made for the
different modifier combinations, pro- vided these are
actually being defined. (The table lists the two pos- sible
cases: either the single action code is a lower case letter,
denoted by x or an upper case letter, denoted by Y.)</p>

<p>modifier symbol</p>

<p>none x Y Shift X y AltGr x Y Shift+AltGr X y Control
Control_x Control_y Shift+Control Control_x Control_y
AltGr+Control Control_x Control_y Shift+AltGr+Control
Control_x Control_y Alt Meta_x Meta_Y Shift+Alt Meta_X
Meta_y AltGr+Alt Meta_x Meta_Y Shift+AltGr+Alt Meta_X Meta_y
Control+Alt Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y Shift+Control+Alt
Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y AltGr+Control+Alt
Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y Shift+AltGr+Control+Alt
Meta_Control_x Meta_Control_y</p>

<p>SINGLE MODIFIER DEFINITIONS All the previous forms of
key definition lines always define all the M+1 possible
modifier combinations being defined, whether the line
actually contains that many action codes or not. There is,
however, a variation of the definition syntax for defining
only single actions to a particular modifier combination of
a key. This is especially useful, if you load a keymap which
doesnt match your needs in only some modi- fier
combinations, like AltGr+function keys. You can then make a
small local file redefining only those modifier combinations
and loading it after the main file. The syntax of this form
is:</p>

<p>{ plain | &lt;modifier sequence&gt; } keycode keynumber
= keysym</p>

<p>, e.g., plain keycode 14 = BackSpace control alt keycode
83 = Boot alt keycode 105 = Decr_Console alt keycode 106 =
Incr_Console Using &quot;plain&quot; will define only the
base entry of a key (i.e. the one with no modifiers in
effect) without affecting the bindings of other modifier
combinations of that key.</p>

<p>STRING DEFINITIONS In addition to comments and key
definition lines, a keymap can contain string definitions.
These are used to define what each function key action code
sends. The syntax of string definitions is:</p>

<p>string keysym = &quot;text&quot;</p>

<p>text can contain literal characters, octal character
codes in the for- mat of backslash followed by up to three
octal digits, and the three escape sequencesn,\and
respectively.</p>

<p>COMPOSE DEFINITIONS Then there may also be compose
definitions. They have syntax</p>

<p>composechachartochar and describe how two bytes are
combined to form a third one (when a dead accent or compose
key is used). This is used to get accented let- ters and the
like on a standard keyboard.</p>

<p>ABBREVIATIONS Various abbreviations can be used with
kbd-0.96 and later.</p>

<p>strings as usual Defines the usual values of the strings
(but not the keys they are bound to).</p>

<p>compose as usual for &quot;iso-8859-1&quot; Defines the
usual compose combinations.</p>

<p>To find out what keysyms there are available for use in
keymaps, use the command</p>

<p>dumpkeys --long-info</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is currently no description of what
each symbol does. It has to be guessed from the name or
figured out from the kernel sources.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES (Be careful to use a keymaps line, like the
first line of dumpkeys, or &quot;keymaps 0-15&quot; or
so.)</p>

<p>The following entry exchanges the left Control key and
the Caps Lock key on the keyboard:</p>

<p>keycode 58 = Control keycode 29 = Caps_Lock</p>

<p>Key number 58 is normally the Caps Lock key, and key
number 29 is nor- mally the Control key.</p>

<p>The following entry sets the Shift and Caps Lock keys to
behave more nicely, like in older typewriters. That is,
pressing Caps Lock key once or more sets the keyboard in
CapsLock state and pressing either of the Shift keys
releases it.</p>

<p>keycode 42 = Uncaps_Shift keycode 54 = Uncaps_Shift
keycode 58 = Caps_On</p>

<p>The following entry sets the layout of the edit pad in
the enhanced keyboard to be more like that in the VT200
series terminals:</p>

<p>keycode 102 = Insert keycode 104 = Remove keycode 107 =
Prior shift keycode 107 = Scroll_Backward keycode 110 = Find
keycode 111 = Select control alt keycode 111 = Boot control
altgr keycode 111 = Boot</p>

<p>Here s an example to bind the string &quot;du0f0 to the
key AltGr-D. We use the &quot;spare&quot; action code F100
not normally bound to any key.</p>

<p>altgr keycode 32 = F100 string F100 = &quot;du0f0</p>
