<p>IPSEC(8) Executable programs IPSEC(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec - invoke IPsec utilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec command [argument...] ipsec --help ipsec
--version ipsec --directory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipsec invokes any of several utilities
involved in controlling the IPsec encryption/authentication
system, running the specified command with the specified
arguments as if it had been invoked directly. This largely
eliminates possible name collisions with other software, and
also permits some centralized services.</p>

<p>ipsec --help lists the available commands. Most have
their own manual pages, e.g. ipsec_auto(8) for auto.</p>

<p>ipsec --version outputs the software version. A version
code of the form Uxxx/Kyyy&acute;&acute; indicates that the
user-level utilities are version xxx but the kernel portion
appears to be version yyy (this form is used only if the two
disagree). For the NETKEY/XFRM stack, the kernel version is
used, always displaying the U/K split.</p>

<p>ipsec --directory reports where ipsec thinks the IPsec
commands are stored.</p>

<p>COMMANDS To get a list of supported commands, use ipsec
--help. A few of the commonly used commands are described
below</p>

<p>ipsec setup start|stop|restart maps to the host init
system. Supported init systems are sysv, systemd, upstart
and openrc.</p>

<p>ipsec barf dumps the internal system status to stdout
for debugging</p>

<p>ipsec auto is used to manually add, remove, up or down
connections. For more information see &acute;man
ipsec_auto</p>

<p>ipsec whack is used to communicate direct commands to
the pluto daemon using the whack interface. For more
information see &acute;man ipsec_pluto&acute;</p>

<p>ipsec initnss initialises the NSS database that contains
all the X.509 certificate information and private RSA
keys</p>

<p>ipsec import is used to import PKCS#12 X.509 files into
the NSS database</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/libexec/ipsec usual utilities
directory</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ipsec.conf(5), ipsec.secrets(5), ipsec_auto(8),
ipsec_setup(8), ipsec_showhostkey(8)</p>
