<p>GITCVS-MIGRATION(7) Git Manual GITCVS-MIGRATION(7)</p>

<p>NAME gitcvs-migration - git for CVS users</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git cvsimport *</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Git differs from CVS in that every working
tree contains a repository with a full copy of the project
history, and no repository is inherently more important than
any other. However, you can emulate the CVS model by
designating a single shared repository which people can
synchronize with; this document explains how to do that.</p>

<p>Some basic familiarity with git is required. Having gone
through gittutorial(7) and gitglossary(7) should be
sufficient.</p>

<p>DEVELOPING AGAINST A SHARED REPOSITORY Suppose a shared
repository is set up in /pub/repo.git on the host foo.com.
Then as an individual committer you can clone the shared
repository over ssh with:</p>

<p>$ git clone foo.com:/pub/repo.git/ my-project $ cd
my-project</p>

<p>and hack away. The equivalent of cvs update is</p>

<p>$ git pull origin</p>

<p>which merges in any work that others might have done
since the clone operation. If there are uncommitted changes
in your working tree, commit them first before running git
pull.</p>

<p>Note The pull command knows where to get updates from
because of certain configuration variables that were set by
the first git clone command; see git config -l and the
git-config(1) man page for details.</p>

<p>You can update the shared repository with your changes
by first committing your changes, and then using the git
push command:</p>

<p>$ git push origin master</p>

<p>to &quot;push&quot; those commits to the shared
repository. If someone else has updated the repository more
recently, git push, like cvs commit, will complain, in which
case you must pull any changes before attempting the push
again.</p>

<p>In the git push command above we specify the name of the
remote branch to update (master). If we leave that out, git
push tries to update any branches in the remote repository
that have the same name as a branch in the local repository.
So the last push can be done with either of:</p>

<p>$ git push origin $ git push
foo.com:/pub/project.git/</p>

<p>as long as the shared repository does not have any
branches other than master.</p>

<p>SETTING UP A SHARED REPOSITORY We assume you have
already created a git repository for your project, possibly
created from scratch or from a tarball (see gittutorial(7)),
or imported from an already existing CVS repository (see the
next section).</p>

<p>Assume your existing repo is at /home/alice/myproject.
Create a new &quot;bare&quot; repository (a repository
without a working tree) and fetch your project into it:</p>

<p>$ mkdir /pub/my-repo.git $ cd /pub/my-repo.git $ git
--bare init --shared $ git --bare fetch
/home/alice/myproject master:master</p>

<p>Next, give every team member read/write access to this
repository. One easy way to do this is to give all the team
members ssh access to the machine where the repository is
hosted. If you don t want to give them a full shell on the
machine, there is a restricted shell which only allows users
to do git pushes and pulls; see git-shell(1).</p>

<p>Put all the committers in the same group, and make the
repository writable by that group:</p>

<p>$ chgrp -R $group /pub/my-repo.git</p>

<p>Make sure committers have a umask of at most 027, so
that the directories they create are writable and searchable
by other group members.</p>

<p>IMPORTING A CVS ARCHIVE First, install version 2.1 or
higher of cvsps from http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/ and make
sure it is in your path. Then cd to a checked out CVS
working directory of the project you are interested in and
run git-cvsimport(1):</p>

<p>$ git cvsimport -C &lt;destination&gt;
&lt;module&gt;</p>

<p>This puts a git archive of the named CVS module in the
directory &lt;destination&gt;, which will be created if
necessary.</p>

<p>The import checks out from CVS every revision of every
file. Reportedly cvsimport can average some twenty revisions
per second, so for a medium-sized project this should not
take more than a couple of minutes. Larger projects or
remote repositories may take longer.</p>

<p>The main trunk is stored in the git branch named origin,
and additional CVS branches are stored in git branches with
the same names. The most recent version of the main trunk is
also left checked out on the master branch, so you can start
adding your own changes right away.</p>

<p>The import is incremental, so if you call it again next
month it will fetch any CVS updates that have been made in
the meantime. For this to work, you must not modify the
imported branches; instead, create new branches for your own
changes, and merge in the imported branches as
necessary.</p>

<p>If you want a shared repository, you will need to make a
bare clone of the imported directory, as described above.
Then treat the imported directory as another development
clone for purposes of merging incremental imports.</p>

<p>ADVANCED SHARED REPOSITORY MANAGEMENT Git allows you to
specify scripts called &quot;hooks&quot; to be run at
certain points. You can use these, for example, to send all
commits to the shared repository to a mailing list. See
githooks(5).</p>

<p>You can enforce finer grained permissions using update
hooks. See Controlling access to branches using update
hooks[1].</p>

<p>PROVIDING CVS ACCESS TO A GIT REPOSITORY It is also
possible to provide true CVS access to a git repository, so
that developers can still use CVS; see git-cvsserver(1) for
details.</p>

<p>ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT MODELS CVS users are accustomed
to giving a group of developers commit access to a common
repository. As we ve seen, this is also possible with git.
However, the distributed nature of git allows other
development models, and you may want to first consider
whether one of them might be a better fit for your
project.</p>

<p>For example, you can choose a single person to maintain
the projects primary public repository. Other developers
then clone this repository and each work in their own clone.
When they have a series of changes that theyre happy with,
they ask the maintainer to pull from the branch containing
the changes. The maintainer reviews their changes and pulls
them into the primary repository, which other developers
pull from as necessary to stay coordinated. The Linux kernel
and other projects use variants of this model.</p>

<p>With a small group, developers may just pull changes
from each others repositories without the need for a central
maintainer.</p>
