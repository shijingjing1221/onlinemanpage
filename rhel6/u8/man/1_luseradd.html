<p>NAME luseradd - Add an user</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS luseradd [OPTION]... user</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Adds an user with name user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --gecos=gecos Set the GECOS field to gecos.
The GECOS field is traditionally used to store user s real
name and other information.</p>

<p>-d, --directory=directory Set users home directory to
directory. If this option is not present, a default
specified by libuser configuration is used.</p>

<p>-g, --gid=group Set users primary group to group. group
can either be a group ID of an existing group, or a group
name; if group is a group name and the group does not exist,
it is created. If the --gid option is not specified, the
default group name is user.</p>

<p>-i, --interactive Ask all questions when connecting to
the user database, even if default answers are set up in
libuser configuration.</p>

<p>-k, --skeleton=directory Populate the newly created user
s home directory with a copy of directory. If this option is
not present, a default directory specified by libuser
configuration, or /etc/skel if libuser con- figuration does
not specify a default, is used.</p>

<p>-M, --nocreatehome Dont create a home directory and a
mail spool for the newly created user.</p>

<p>-n, --nocreategroup If a group is not specified using
-g, use group name &quot;users&quot; instead of user. Note
that despite the name of the option, the group will still be
created if it does not exist.</p>

<p>-P, --plainpassword=password Set users password to
password. Note that the password can be viewed while running
luseradd using tools such as ps(1).</p>

<p>-p, --password=encrypted Set users password to the
password represented by the hash encrypted. Note that the
hash can be viewed while running luseradd using tools such
as ps(1).</p>

<p>-r, --reserved The user is a system user. Users that are
not marked as system user usually have automatically
selected user IDs above a cer- tain value (500 by default).
This information is also passed to the libuser backends.
This option implies the -M option.</p>

<p>-s, --shell=shell Set users login shell to shell. If
this option is not present, a default specified by libuser
configuration is used.</p>

<p>-u, --uid=uid Use user ID uid for the newly created
user. An user ID is selected automatically if this option is
not present.</p>
