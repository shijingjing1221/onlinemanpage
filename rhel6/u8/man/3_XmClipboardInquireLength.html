<p>NAME XmClipboardInquireLength A clipboard function that
returns the length of the stored data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardInquireLength (display, window, format_name,
length) Display * display; Window window; char *
format_name; unsigned long * length; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardInquireLength returns the length
of the data stored under a specified format name for the
clipboard data item. If no data is found for the specified
format, or if there is no item on the clipboard, this
function returns a value of 0 (zero) in the length
argument.</p>

<p>Any format passed by name is assumed to have length
passed in a call to XmClipboardCopy, even though the data
has not yet been transferred to the clipboard in that
format.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>format_name Specifies the name of the format for the
data item.</p>

<p>length Specifies the length of the next data item in the
specified format. This argument equals 0 (zero) if no data
is found for the specified format, or if there is no item on
the clip- board.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardNoData The function could not find data on
the clipboard correspond- ing to the format requested. This
could occur because the clipboard is empty; there is data on
the clipboard, but not in the requested format; or the data
in the requested format was passed by name and is no longer
available.</p>
