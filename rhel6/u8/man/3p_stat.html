<p>STAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME stat - get file status</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int stat(const char *restrict path, struct stat
*restrict buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The stat() function shall obtain information
about the named file and write it to the area pointed to by
the buf argument. The path argument points to a pathname
naming a file. Read, write, or execute permission of the
named file is not required. An implementation that provides
additional or alternate file access control mechanisms may,
under implementation-defined conditions, cause stat() to
fail. In particular, the system may deny the existence of
the file specified by path.</p>

<p>If the named file is a symbolic link, the stat()
function shall con- tinue pathname resolution using the
contents of the symbolic link, and shall return information
pertaining to the resulting file if the file exists.</p>

<p>The buf argument is a pointer to a stat structure, as
defined in the &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; header, into which
information is placed concerning the file.</p>

<p>The stat() function shall update any time-related fields
(as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 4.7, File Times Update), before writing
into the stat structure.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, the structure members
st_mode, st_ino, st_dev, st_uid, st_gid, st_atime, st_ctime,
and st_mtime shall have meaningful values for all file types
defined in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. The value of
the member st_nlink shall be set to the number of links to
the file.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The stat() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix.</p>

<p>EIO An error occurred while reading from the file
system.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file size in bytes or the number of blocks
allocated to the file or the file serial number cannot be
represented correctly in the structure pointed to by
buf.</p>

<p>The stat() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW A value to be stored would overflow one of the
members of the stat structure.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Obtaining File Status Information The following
example shows how to obtain file status information for a
file named /home/cnd/mod1. The structure variable buffer is
defined for the stat structure.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct stat buffer; int status; ... status =
stat(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;, &amp;buffer);</p>

<p>Getting Directory Information The following example
fragment gets status information for each entry in a
directory. The call to the stat() function stores file
information in the stat structure pointed to by statbuf. The
lines that follow the stat() call format the fields in the
stat structure for presentation to the user of the
program.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;dirent.h&gt; #include &lt;pwd.h&gt; #include
&lt;grp.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt; #include
&lt;locale.h&gt; #include &lt;langinfo.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct dirent *dp; struct stat statbuf; struct passwd
*pwd; struct group *grp; struct tm *tm; char
datestring[256]; ... /* Loop through directory entries. */
while ((dp = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {</p>

<p>/* Get entrs information. */ if (stat(dp-&gt;d_name,
&amp;statbuf) == -1) continue;</p>

<p>/* Print out type, permissions, and number of links. */
printf(&quot;%10.10s&quot;, sperm (statbuf.st_mode));
printf(&quot;%4d&quot;, statbuf.st_nlink);</p>

<p>/* Print out ownes name if it is found using getpwuid().
*/ if ((pwd = getpwuid(statbuf.st_uid)) != NULL)
printf(&quot; %-8.8s&quot;, pwd-&gt;pw_name); else
printf(&quot; %-8d&quot;, statbuf.st_uid);</p>

<p>/* Print out group name if it is found using getgrgid().
*/ if ((grp = getgrgid(statbuf.st_gid)) != NULL)
printf(&quot; %-8.8s&quot;, grp-&gt;gr_name); else
printf(&quot; %-8d&quot;, statbuf.st_gid);</p>

<p>/* Print size of file. */ printf(&quot; %9jd&quot;,
(intmax_t)statbuf.st_size);</p>

<p>tm = localtime(&amp;statbuf.st_mtime);</p>

<p>/* Get localized date string. */ strftime(datestring,
sizeof(datestring), nl_langinfo(D_T_FMT), tm);</p>

<p>printf(&quot; %s %n&quot;, datestring, dp-&gt;d_name);
}</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The intent of the paragraph describing
&quot;additional or alternate file access control
mechanisms&quot; is to allow a secure implementation where a
process with a label that does not dominate the file s label
cannot perform a stat() function. This is not related to
read permission; a process with a label that dominates the
files label does not need read permission. An implementation
that supports write-up operations could fail fstat()
function calls even though it has a valid file descriptor
open for writing.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
