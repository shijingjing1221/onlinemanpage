<p>REPQUOTA(8) REPQUOTA(8)</p>

<p>NAME repquota - summarize quotas for a filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/repquota [ -vspiug ] [ -c | -C ] [ -t
| -n ] [ -F format-name ] filesystem...</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/repquota [ -avtpsiug ] [ -c | -C ] [ -t | -n ]
[ -F format- name ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION repquota prints a summary of the disc usage
and quotas for the speci- fied file systems. For each user
the current number of files and amount of space (in
kilobytes) is printed, along with any quotas cre- ated with
edquota(8). As repquota has to translate ids of all
users/groups to names (unless option -n was specified) it
may take a while to print all the information. To make
translating as fast as pos- sible repquota tries to detect
(by reading /etc/nsswitch.conf) whether entries are stored
in standard plain text file or in database and either
translates chunks of 1024 names or each name individually.
You can override this autodetection by -c or -C options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --all Report on all filesystems indicated in
/etc/mtab to be read- write with quotas.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Report all quotas, even if there is no
usage. Be also more ver- bose about quotafile
information.</p>

<p>-c, --batch-translation Cache entries to report and
translate uids/gids to names in big chunks by scanning all
users (default). This is good (fast) behaviour when using
/etc/passwd file.</p>

<p>-C, --no-batch-translation Translate individual entries.
This is faster when you have users stored in database.</p>

<p>-t, --truncate-names Truncate user/group names longer
than 9 characters. This results in nicer output when there
are such names.</p>

<p>-n, --no-names Don t resolve UIDs/GIDs to names. This
can speedup printing a lot.</p>

<p>-s, --human-readable Try to report used space, number of
used inodes and limits in more appropriate units than the
default ones.</p>

<p>-p, --raw-grace When user is in grace period, report
time in seconds since epoch when his grace time runs out (or
has run out). Field is 0 when no grace time is in effect.
This is especially useful when parsing output by a
script.</p>

<p>-i, --no-autofs Ignore mountpoints mounted by
automounter.</p>

<p>-F, --format=format-name Report quota for specified
format (ie. don t perform format autodetection). Possible
format names are: vfsold Original quota format with 16-bit
UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs,
64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits, vfsv1
Quota format with 64-bit quota limits and usage, xfs (quota
on XFS filesystem)</p>

<p>-g, --group Report quotas for groups.</p>

<p>-u, --user Report quotas for users. This is the
default.</p>

<p>Only the super-user may view quotas which are not their
own.</p>

<p>FILES aquota.user or aquota.group quota file at the
filesystem root (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
quota.user or quota.group quota file at the filesystem root
(version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems) /etc/mtab default
filesystems /etc/passwd default set of users /etc/group
default set of groups</p>
