<p>NAME rrdtool - Round Robin Database Tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rrdtool - [workdir]| function</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW It is pretty easy to gather status
information from all sorts of things, ranging from the
temperature in your office to the number of octets which
have passed through the FDDI interface of your router. But
it is not so trivial to store this data in an efficient and
systematic manner. This is where RRDtool comes in handy. It
lets you log and analyze the data you gather from all kinds
of data-sources (DS). The data analysis part of RRDtool is
based on the ability to quickly generate graphical
representations of the data values collected over a
definable time period.</p>

<p>In this man page you will find general information on
the design and functionality of the Round Robin Database
Tool (RRDtool). For a more detailed description of how to
use the individual functions of RRDtool check the
corresponding man page.</p>

<p>For an introduction to the usage of RRDtool make sure
you consult the rrdtutorial.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS While the man pages talk of command line
switches you have to set in order to make RRDtool work it is
important to note that RRDtool can be remotely controlled
through a set of pipes. This saves a considerable amount of
startup time when you plan to make RRDtool do a lot of
things quickly. Check the section on Remote_Control further
down. There is also a number of language bindings for
RRDtool which allow you to use it directly from Perl,
python, Tcl, PHP, etc.</p>

<p>create Set up a new Round Robin Database (RRD). Check
rrdcreate.</p>

<p>update Store new data values into an RRD. Check
rrdupdate.</p>

<p>updatev Operationally equivalent to update except for
output. Check rrdupdate.</p>

<p>graph Create a graph from data stored in one or several
RRDs. Apart from generating graphs, data can also be
extracted to stdout. Check rrdgraph.</p>

<p>dump Dump the contents of an RRD in plain ASCII. In
connection with restore you can use this to move an RRD from
one computer architecture to another. Check rrddump.</p>

<p>restore Restore an RRD in XML format to a binary RRD.
Check rrdrestore</p>

<p>fetch Get data for a certain time period from a RRD. The
graph function uses fetch to retrieve its data from an RRD.
Check rrdfetch.</p>

<p>tune Alter setup of an RRD. Check rrdtune.</p>

<p>last Find the last update time of an RRD. Check
rrdlast.</p>

<p>info Get information about an RRD. Check rrdinfo.</p>

<p>rrdresize Change the size of individual RRAs. This is
dangerous! Check rrdresize.</p>

<p>xport Export data retrieved from one or several RRDs.
Check rrdxport</p>

<p>rrdcgi This is a standalone tool for producing RRD
graphs on the fly. Check rrdcgi.</p>

<p>HOW DOES RRDTOOL WORK? Data Acquisition When monitoring
the state of a system, it is convenient to have the data
available at a constant time interval. Unfortunately, you
may not always be able to fetch data at exactly the time you
want to. Therefore RRDtool lets you update the logfile at
any time you want. It will automatically interpolate the
value of the data-source (DS) at the latest official
time-slot (interval) and write this interpolated value to
the log. The original value you have supplied is stored as
well and is also taken into account when interpolating the
next log entry.</p>

<p>Consolidation You may log data at a 1 minute interval,
but you might also be interested to know the development of
the data over the last year. You could do this by simply
storing the data in 1 minute intervals for the whole year.
While this would take considerable disk space it would also
take a lot of time to analyze the data when you wanted to
create a graph covering the whole year. RRDtool offers a
solution to this problem through its data consolidation
feature. When setting up an Round Robin Database (RRD), you
can define at which interval this consolidation should
occur, and what consolidation function (CF) (average,
minimum, maximum, total, last) should be used to build the
consolidated values (see rrdcreate). You can define any
number of different consolidation setups within one RRD.
They will all be maintained on the fly when new data is
loaded into the RRD.</p>

<p>Round Robin Archives Data values of the same
consolidation setup are stored into Round Robin Archives
(RRA). This is a very efficient manner to store data for a
certain amount of time, while using a known and constant
amount of storage space.</p>

<p>It works like this: If you want to store 1 000 values in
5 minute interval, RRDtool will allocate space for 1 000
data values and a header area. In the header it will store a
pointer telling which slots (value) in the storage area was
last written to. New values are written to the Round Robin
Archive in, you guessed it, a round robin manner. This
automatically limits the history to the last 1000 values (in
our example). Because you can define several RRAs within a
single RRD, you can setup another one, for storing 750 data
values at a 2 hour interval, for example, and thus keep a
log for the last two months at a lower resolution.</p>

<p>The use of RRAs guarantees that the RRD does not grow
over time and that old data is automatically eliminated. By
using the consolidation feature, you can still keep data for
a very long time, while gradually reducing the resolution of
the data along the time axis.</p>

<p>Using different consolidation functions (CF) allows you
to store exactly the type of information that actually
interests you: the maximum one minute traffic on the LAN,
the minimum temperature of your wine cellar, the total
minutes of down time, etc.</p>

<p>Unknown Data As mentioned earlier, the RRD stores data
at a constant interval. Sometimes it may happen that no new
data is available when a value has to be written to the RRD.
Data acquisition may not be possible for one reason or
other. With RRDtool you can handle these situations by
storing an *UNKNOWN* value into the database. The value
*UNKNOWN* is supported through all the functions of the
tool. When consolidating a data set, the amount of *UNKNOWN*
data values is accounted for and when a new consolidated
value is ready to be written to its Round Robin Archive
(RRA), a validity check is performed to make sure that the
percentage of unknown values in the data point is above a
configurable level. If not, an *UNKNOWN* value will be
written to the RRA.</p>

<p>Graphing RRDtool allows you to generate reports in
numerical and graphical form based on the data stored in one
or several RRDs. The graphing feature is fully configurable.
Size, color and contents of the graph can be defined freely.
Check rrdgraph for more information on this.</p>

<p>Aberrant Behavior Detection by Jake Brutlag</p>

<p>RRDtool provides the building blocks for near real-time
aberrant behavior detection. These components include:</p>

<p>&middot; An algorithm for predicting the value of a time
series one time step into the future.</p>

<p>&middot; A measure of deviation between predicted and
observed values.</p>

<p>&middot; A mechanism to decide if and when an observed
value or sequence of observed values is too deviant from the
predicted value(s).</p>

<p>Here is a brief explanation of these components:</p>

<p>The Holt-Winters time series forecasting algorithm is an
on- line (or incremental) algorithm that adaptively predicts
future observations in a time series. Its forecast is the
sum of three components: a baseline (or intercept), a linear
trend over time (or slope), and a seasonal coefficient (a
periodic effect, such as a daily cycle). There is one
seasonal coefficient for each time point in the period
(cycle). After a value is observed, each of these components
is updated via exponential smoothing. This means that the
algorithm &quot;learns&quot; from past values and uses them
to predict the future. The rate of adaptation is governed by
3 parameters, alpha (intercept), beta (slope), and gamma
(seasonal). The prediction can also be viewed as a smoothed
value for the time series.</p>

<p>The measure of deviation is a seasonal weighted absolute
deviation. The term seasonal means deviation is measured
separately for each time point in the seasonal cycle. As
with Holt-Winters forecasting, deviation is predicted using
the measure computed from past values (but only at that
point in the seasonal cycle). After the value is observed,
the algorithm learns from the observed value via exponential
smoothing. Confidence bands for the observed time series are
generated by scaling the sequence of predicted deviation
values (we usually think of the sequence as a continuous
line rather than a set of discrete points).</p>

<p>Aberrant behavior (a potential failure) is reported
whenever the number of times the observed value violates the
confidence bands meets or exceeds a specified threshold
within a specified temporal window (e.g. 5 violations during
the past 45 minutes with a value observed every 5
minutes).</p>

<p>This functionality is embedded in a set of related RRAs.
In particular, a FAILURES RRA logs potential failures. With
these data you could, for example, use a front-end
application to RRDtool to initiate real-time alerts.</p>

<p>For a detailed description on how to set this up, see
rrdcreate.</p>

<p>REMOTE CONTROL When you start RRDtool with the command
line option - it waits for input via standard input (STDIN).
With this feature you can improve performance by attaching
RRDtool to another process (MRTG is one example) through a
set of pipes. Over these pipes RRDtool accepts the same
arguments as on the command line and some special commands
like quit, cd, mkdir and ls. For detailed help on the server
commands type:</p>

<p>rrdtool help cd|mkdir|pwd|ls|quit</p>

<p>When a command is completed, RRDtool will print the
string &quot;OK&quot;, followed by timing information of the
form u:usertime s:systemtime. Both values are the running
totals of seconds since RRDtool was started. If an error
occurs, a line of the form &quot;ERROR:&quot; Description of
error will be printed instead. RRDtool will not abort,
unless something really serious happens. If a workdir is
specified and the UID is 0, RRDtool will do a chroot to that
workdir. If the UID is not 0, RRDtool only changes the
current directory to workdir.</p>

<p>RRD Server If you want to create a RRD-Server, you must
choose a TCP/IP Service number and add them to /etc/services
like this:</p>

<p>rrdsrv 13900/tcp # RRD server</p>

<p>Attention: the TCP port 13900 isnt officially registered
for rrdsrv. You can use any unused port in your services
file, but the server and the client system must use the same
port, of course.</p>

<p>With this configuration you can add RRDtool as
meta-server to /etc/inetd.conf. For example:</p>

<p>rrdsrv stream tcp nowait root /opt/rrd/bin/rrdtool
rrdtool - /var/rrd</p>

<p>Dont forget to create the database directory /var/rrd
and reinitialize your inetd.</p>

<p>If all was setup correctly, you can access the server
with Perl sockets, tools like netcat, or in a quick
interactive test by using telnet localhost rrdsrv.</p>

<p>NOTE: that there is no authentication with this feature!
Do not setup such a port unless you are sure what you are
doing.</p>
