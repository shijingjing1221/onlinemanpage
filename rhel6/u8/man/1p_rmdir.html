<p>RMDIR(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RMDIR(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME rmdir - remove directories</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmdir [-p] dir...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rmdir utility shall remove the directory
entry specified by each dir operand.</p>

<p>For each dir operand, the rmdir utility shall perform
actions equiva- lent to the rmdir() function called with the
dir operand as its only argument.</p>

<p>Directories shall be processed in the order specified.
If a directory and a subdirectory of that directory are
specified in a single invoca- tion of the rmdir utility, the
application shall specify the subdirec- tory before the
parent directory so that the parent directory will be empty
when the rmdir utility tries to remove it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The rmdir utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-p Remove all directories in a pathname. For each dir
operand:</p>

<p>1. The directory entry it names shall be removed.</p>

<p>2. If the dir operand includes more than one pathname
compo- nent, effects equivalent to the following command
shall occur:</p>

<p>rmdir -p $(dirname dir)</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>dir A pathname of an empty directory to be removed.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of rmdir:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Each directory entry specified by a dir operand was
removed suc- cessfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The definition of an empty directory
is one that contains, at most, directory entries for dot and
dot-dot.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES If a directory a in the current directory is
empty except it contains a directory b and a/b is empty
except it contains a directory c:</p>

<p>rmdir -p a/b/c</p>

<p>removes all three directories.</p>

<p>RATIONALE On historical System V systems, the -p option
also caused a message to be written to the standard output.
The message indicated whether the whole path was removed or
whether part of the path remained for some reason. The
STDERR section requires this diagnostic when the entire path
specified by a dir operand is not removed, but does not
allow the status message reporting success to be written as
a diagnostic.</p>

<p>The rmdir utility on System V also included a -s option
that suppressed the informational message output by the -p
option. This option has been omitted because the
informational message is not specified by this vol- ume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
