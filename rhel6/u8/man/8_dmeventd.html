<p>NAME dmeventd Device-mapper event daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dmeventd [-d [-d [-d]]] [-f] [-h] [-l] [-R]
[-V] [-?]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dmeventd is the event monitoring daemon for
device-mapper devices. Library plugins can register and
carry out actions triggered when par- ticular events
occur.</p>

<p>LVM PLUGINS Mirror Attempts to handle device failure
automatically. See lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>Raid Attempts to handle device failure automatically.
See lvm.conf(5).</p>

<p>Snapshot Monitors how full a snapshot is becoming and
emits a warning to syslog when it exceeds 80% full. The
warning is repeated when 85%, 90% and 95% of the snapshot is
filled. See lvm.conf(5). Snapshot which runs out of space
gets invalid and when it is mounted, it gets umounted if
possible.</p>

<p>Thin Monitors how full a thin pool data and metadata is
becoming and emits a warning to syslog when it exceeds 80%
full. The warning is repeated when 85%, 90% and 95% of the
thin pool is filled. See lvm.conf(5). If the thin-pool runs
out of space, thin vol- umes are umounted if possible.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Repeat from 1 to 3 times ( -d, -dd, -ddd ) to
increase the detail of debug messages sent to syslog. Each
extra d adds more debugging information.</p>

<p>-f Dont fork, run in the foreground.</p>

<p>-h Show help information.</p>

<p>-l Log through stdout and stderr instead of syslog. This
option works only with option -f, otherwise it is
ignored.</p>

<p>-? Show help information on stderr.</p>

<p>-R Replace a running dmeventd instance. The running
dmeventd must be version 2.02.77 or newer. The new dmeventd
instance will obtain a list of devices and events to monitor
from the cur- rently running daemon.</p>

<p>-V Show version of dmeventd.</p>
