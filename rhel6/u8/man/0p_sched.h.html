<p>NAME sched.h - execution scheduling (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sched.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;sched.h&gt; header shall define the
sched_param structure, which con- tains the scheduling
parameters required for implementation of each supported
scheduling policy. This structure shall contain at least the
following member:</p>

<p>int sched_priority Process execution scheduling
priority.</p>

<p>In addition, if _POSIX_SPORADIC_SERVER or
_POSIX_THREAD_SPORADIC_SERVER is defined, the sched_param
structure defined in &lt;sched.h&gt; shall con- tain the
following members in addition to those specified above:</p>

<p>int sched_ss_low_priority Low scheduling priority for
sporadic server. struct timespec sched_ss_repl_period
Replenishment period for sporadic server. struct timespec
sched_ss_init_budget Initial budget for sporadic server. int
sched_ss_max_repl Maximum pending replenishments for
sporadic server.</p>

<p>Each process is controlled by an associated scheduling
policy and pri- ority. Associated with each policy is a
priority range. Each policy definition specifies the minimum
priority range for that policy. The priority ranges for each
policy may overlap the priority ranges of other
policies.</p>

<p>Four scheduling policies are defined; others may be
defined by the implementation. The four standard policies
are indicated by the values of the following symbolic
constants:</p>

<p>SCHED_FIFO First in-first out (FIFO) scheduling
policy.</p>

<p>SCHED_RR Round robin scheduling policy.</p>

<p>SCHED_SPORADIC Sporadic server scheduling policy.</p>

<p>SCHED_OTHER Another scheduling policy.</p>

<p>The values of these constants are distinct.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>int sched_get_priority_max(int); int
sched_get_priority_min(int);</p>

<p>int sched_getparam(pid_t, struct sched_param *); int
sched_getscheduler(pid_t);</p>

<p>int sched_rr_get_interval(pid_t, struct timespec *);</p>

<p>int sched_setparam(pid_t, const struct sched_param *);
int sched_setscheduler(pid_t, int, const struct sched_param
*);</p>

<p>int sched_yield(void);</p>

<p>Inclusion of the &lt;sched.h&gt; header may make visible
all symbols from the &lt;time.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
