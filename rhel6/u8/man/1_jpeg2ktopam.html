<p>NAME jpeg2ktopam - convert JPEG-2000 code stream to
PAM/PNM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jpeg2ktopam [-verbose] [-debuglevel=number]
filename</p>

<p>OPTION USAGE Minimum unique abbreviation of option is
acceptable. You may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single
hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in place
of the equals sign to separate an option name from its
value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>jpeg2ktopam converts the named JPEG-2000 file (JP2 or
JPC), or Standard Input if no file is named, to a PBM, PGM,
PPM, or PAM file on Standard Output.</p>

<p>The JPEG-2000 specification specifies two different
formats: JP2 and JPEG-2000 code stream (JPC). JP2 represents
a visual image quite specifically, whereas JPC is a more or
less arbitrary array of codes. A JP2 image contains a JPC
stream and metadata describing how that stream represents a
visual image. jpeg2ktopam converts both.</p>

<p>If the color space identified in the image is grayscale
(JAS_IMAGE_CS_GRAY), jpeg2ktopam generates a PGM image,
unless the image contains only one bit per pixel, in which
case jpeg2ktopam gener- ates PBM. If the color space is RGB
(JAS_IMAGE_CS_RGB), jpeg2ktopam generates a PPM image. If
the input image is anything else, jpeg2ktopam generates a
PAM image with no tuple type identified.</p>

<p>In the PGM and PPM cases, jpeg2ktopam assumes the
intensity values in the input image have the same meaning as
for PGM and PPM. One thing that implies is the ITU-R
Recommendation BT.709 color space, which means the
assumption is false for JP2 input. JP2 input uses SRGB color
encoding. So if you use jpeg2ktopam to convert a JP2 image
to PPM, it changes the visual image (slightly) -- the colors
in the output are not the same as in the input.</p>

<p>In the PAM image, the output samples are numerically
identical to the input samples. If the input samples are
signed, they are represented in twos complement form in the
output (because PAM samples are always unsigned). The PAM
plane numbers are identical to the JPC component
numbers.</p>

<p>A JPEG-2000 image has a &quot;precision,&quot; which is
the number of bits used for each code (in Netpbm lingo,
&quot;sample&quot;). Actually, each component has a separate
precision. The maxval of a PGM, PPM, or PAM output is the
largest number you can represent in the JPEG-2000 precision
of the JPEG-2000 component with the greatest precision. The
samples in all components are scaled to that maxval. So if
the red component has a precision of 4 bits and the green
component has a precision of 6 bits, the maxval is 63 and
the red component codes from the JPEG-2000 image are
multiplied by 63/15 to generate the output samples.</p>

<p>jpeg2ktopam interprets the JPEG-2000 input with the
Jasper JPEG-2000 library . See documentation of the library
for details on what jpeg2ktopam handles. Note that the
Jasper library contains facilities for writing PNM images,
but jpeg2ktopam does not use those. It uses the Netpbm
library instead. Note that the makers of the Jasper library
write it &quot;JasPer,&quot; but Netpbm documentation
follows standard American English typography rules, which
dont allow that kind of capitaliza- tion.</p>

<p>Use pamtojpeg2k to convert in the other direction.</p>

<p>The program jasper, which is packaged with the Jasper
JPEG-2000 library, also converts between JPEG-2000 and PNM
formats. Because its packaged with the library, it may
exploit it better, especially recently added features.
However, since it does not use the Netpbm library to read
and write the Netpbm formats, it doesnt do as good a job on
that side.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -verbose This option causes jpeg2ktopam to issue
informational messages about the conversion process.</p>

<p>-debuglevel=number This option controls debug messages
from the Jasper library. jpeg2ktopam passes number as the
debug level to the Jasper JPEG-2000 decoder.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES jpeg2ktopam myimg.jpc &gt;myimg.ppm</p>

<p>ABOUT JPEG-2000 See thepamtojpeg2kmanual(1) for general
information on JPEG-2000 com- pression and the JPEG-2000
formats.</p>

<p>History jpeg2ktopam was added to Netpbm in Release 10.12
(November 2002).</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), jpeg2ktopam could
not convert a JP2 file -- only JPC.</p>
