<p>JOBS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual JOBS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME jobs - display status of jobs in the current
session</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jobs [-l| -p][job_id...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jobs utility shall display the status of
jobs that were started in the current shell environment; see
Shell Execution Environment .</p>

<p>When jobs reports the termination status of a job, the
shell shall remove its process ID from the list of those
&quot;known in the current shell execution environment; see
Asynchronous Lists .</p>

<p>OPTIONS The jobs utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) Provide more information about each
job listed. This information shall include the job number,
current job, process group ID, state, and the command that
formed the job.</p>

<p>-p Display only the process IDs for the process group
leaders of the selected jobs.</p>

<p>By default, the jobs utility shall display the status of
all stopped jobs, running background jobs and all jobs whose
status has changed and have not been reported by the
shell.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>job_id Specifies the jobs for which the status is to be
displayed. If no job_id is given, the status information for
all jobs shall be displayed. The format of job_id is
described in the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.203, Job Control Job ID.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of jobs:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If the -p option is specified, the output shall
consist of one line for each process ID:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;process ID&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the -l option is not specified, the output
shall be a series of lines of the form:</p>

<p>&quot;[%d] %c %s %n&quot;, &lt;job-number&gt;,
&lt;current&gt;, &lt;state&gt;, &lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>where the fields shall be as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;current&gt; The character + identifies the job that
would be used as a default for the fg or bg utilities; this
job can also be speci- fied using the job_id %+ or
&quot;%%&quot; . The character - identifies the job that
would become the default if the current default job were to
exit; this job can also be specified using the job_id %-.
For other jobs, this field is a &lt;space&gt;. At most one
job can be identified with + and at most one job can be
identified with - . If there is any suspended job, then the
current job shall be a suspended job. If there are at least
two suspended jobs, then the previous job also shall be a
suspended job.</p>

<p>&lt;job-number&gt; A number that can be used to identify
the process group to the wait, fg, bg, and kill utilities.
Using these utilities, the job can be identified by
prefixing the job number with% .</p>

<p>&lt;state&gt; One of the following strings (in the POSIX
locale):</p>

<p>Running Indicates that the job has not been suspended by
a signal and has not exited.</p>

<p>Done Indicates that the job completed and returned exit
status zero.</p>

<p>Done(code) Indicates that the job completed normally and
that it exited with the specified non-zero exit status,
code, expressed as a decimal number.</p>

<p>Stopped Indicates that the job was suspended by the
SIGTSTP signal.</p>

<p>Stopped (SIGTSTP)</p>

<p>Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTSTP
signal.</p>

<p>Stopped (SIGSTOP)</p>

<p>Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGSTOP
signal.</p>

<p>Stopped (SIGTTIN)</p>

<p>Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTIN
signal.</p>

<p>Stopped (SIGTTOU)</p>

<p>Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTOU
signal.</p>

<p>The implementation may substitute the string Suspended
in place of Stopped. If the job was terminated by a signal,
the format of &lt;state&gt; is unspecified, but it shall be
visibly distinct from all of the other &lt;state&gt; formats
shown here and shall indicate the name or description of the
signal causing the termination.</p>

<p>&lt;command&gt; The associated command that was given to
the shell.</p>

<p>If the -l option is specified, a field containing the
process group ID shall be inserted before the &lt;state&gt;
field. Also, more processes in a process group may be output
on separate lines, using only the process ID and
&lt;command&gt; fields.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The -p option is the only portable way
to find out the process group of a job because different
implementations have different strategies for defining the
process group of the job. Usage such as $( jobs -p) pro-
vides a way of referring to the process group of the job in
an imple- mentation-independent way.</p>

<p>The jobs utility does not work as expected when it is
operating in its own utility execution environment because
that environment has no applicable jobs to manipulate. See
the APPLICATION USAGE section for bg . For this reason, jobs
is generally implemented as a shell regular built-in.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Both &quot;%%&quot; and &quot;%+&quot; are
used to refer to the current job. Both forms are of equal
validity-the &quot;%%&quot; mirroring &quot;$$&quot; and
&quot;%+&quot; mirroring the output of jobs. Both forms
reflect historical practice of the Korn- Shell and the C
shell with job control.</p>

<p>The job control features provided by bg, fg, and jobs
are based on the KornShell. The standard developers examined
the characteristics of the C shell versions of these
utilities and found that differences exist. Despite
widespread use of the C shell, the KornShell versions were
selected for this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 to maintain
a degree of uniformity with the rest of the KornShell
features selected (such as the very popular command line
editing features).</p>

<p>The jobs utility is not dependent on the job control
option, as are the seemingly related bg and fg utilities
because jobs is useful for exam- ining background jobs,
regardless of the condition of job control. When the user
has invoked a set +m command and job control has been turned
off, jobs can still be used to examine the background jobs
asso- ciated with that current session. Similarly, kill can
then be used to kill background jobs with kill%
&lt;background job number&gt;.</p>

<p>The output for terminated jobs is left unspecified to
accommodate vari- ous historical systems. The following
formats have been witnessed:</p>

<p>1. Killed( signal name)</p>

<p>2. signal name</p>

<p>3. signal name( coredump)</p>

<p>4. signal description- core dumped</p>

<p>Most users should be able to understand these formats,
although it means that applications have trouble parsing
them.</p>

<p>The calculation of job IDs was not described since this
would suggest an implementation, which may impose
unnecessary restrictions.</p>

<p>In an early proposal, a -n option was included to
&quot;Display the status of jobs that have changed, exited,
or stopped since the last status report&quot;. It was
removed because the shell always writes any changed status
of jobs before each prompt.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
