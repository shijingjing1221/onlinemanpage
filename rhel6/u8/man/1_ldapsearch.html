<p>DESCRIPTION ldapsearch is a shell-accessible interface
to the ldap_search_ext(3) library call.</p>

<p>ldapsearch opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds,
and performs a search using specified parameters. The filter
should conform to the string representation for search
filters as defined in RFC 4515. If not provided, the default
filter, (objectClass=*), is used.</p>

<p>If ldapsearch finds one or more entries, the attributes
specified by attrs are returned. If * is listed, all user
attributes are returned. If + is listed, all operational
attributes are returned. If no attrs are listed, all user
attributes are returned. If only 1.1 is listed, no
attributes will be returned.</p>

<p>The search results are displayed using an extended
version of LDIF. Option -L controls the format of the
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V[V] Print version info. If -VV is given, only
the version informa- tion is printed.</p>

<p>-d debuglevel Set the LDAP debugging level to
debuglevel. ldapsearch must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG
defined for this option to have any effect.</p>

<p>-n Show what would be done, but dont actually perform
the search. Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.</p>

<p>-v Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to
standard output.</p>

<p>-c Continuous operation mode. Errors are reported, but
ldapsearch will continue with searches. The default is to
exit after reporting an error. Only useful in conjunction
with -f.</p>

<p>-u Include the User Friendly Name form of the
Distinguished Name (DN) in the output.</p>

<p>-t[t] A single -t writes retrieved non-printable values
to a set of temporary files. This is useful for dealing with
values con- taining non-character data such as jpegPhoto or
audio. A second -t writes all retrieved values to files.</p>

<p>-T path Write temporary files to directory specified by
path (default: /var/tmp/)</p>

<p>-F prefix URL prefix for temporary files. Default is
file://path where path is /var/tmp/ or specified with
-T.</p>

<p>-A Retrieve attributes only (no values). This is useful
when you just want to see if an attribute is present in an
entry and are not interested in the specific values.</p>

<p>-L Search results are display in LDAP Data Interchange
Format detailed in ldif(5). A single -L restricts the output
to LDIFv1. A second -L disables comments. A third -L
disables printing of the LDIF version. The default is to use
an extended version of LDIF.</p>

<p>-S attribute Sort the entries returned based on
attribute. The default is not to sort entries returned. If
attribute is a zero-length string (&quot;&quot;), the
entries are sorted by the components of their Distin-
guished Name. See ldap_sort(3) for more details. Note that
ldapsearch normally prints out entries as it receives them.
The use of the -S option defeats this behavior, causing all
entries to be retrieved, then sorted, then printed.</p>

<p>-b searchbase Use searchbase as the starting point for
the search instead of the default.</p>

<p>-s {base|one|sub|children} Specify the scope of the
search to be one of base, one, sub, or children to specify a
base object, one-level, subtree, or chil- dren search. The
default is sub. Note: children scope requires LDAPv3
subordinate feature extension.</p>

<p>-a {never|always|search|find} Specify how aliases
dereferencing is done. Should be one of never, always,
search, or find to specify that aliases are never
dereferenced, always dereferenced, dereferenced when
searching, or dereferenced only when locating the base
object for the search. The default is to never dereference
aliases.</p>

<p>-l timelimit wait at most timelimit seconds for a search
to complete. A timelimit of 0 (zero) or none means no limit.
A timelimit of max means the maximum integer allowable by
the protocol. A server may impose a maximal timelimit which
only the root user may override.</p>

<p>-z sizelimit retrieve at most sizelimit entries for a
search. A sizelimit of 0 (zero) or none means no limit. A
sizelimit of max means the maximum integer allowable by the
protocol. A server may impose a maximal sizelimit which only
the root user may override.</p>

<p>-f file Read a series of lines from file, performing one
LDAP search for each line. In this case, the filter given on
the command line is treated as a pattern where the first and
only occurrence of %s is replaced with a line from file. Any
other occurrence of the the % character in the pattern will
be regarded as an error. Where it is desired that the search
filter include a % charac- ter, the character should be
encoded as25 (see RFC 4515). If file is a single -
character, then the lines are read from stan- dard input.
ldapsearch will exit when the first non-successful search
result is returned, unless -c is used.</p>

<p>-M[M] Enable manage DSA IT control. -MM makes control
critical.</p>

<p>-x Use simple authentication instead of SASL.</p>

<p>-D binddn Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to
the LDAP directory. For SASL binds, the server is expected
to ignore this value.</p>

<p>-W Prompt for simple authentication. This is used
instead of spec- ifying the password on the command
line.</p>

<p>-w passwd Use passwd as the password for simple
authentication.</p>

<p>-y passwdfile Use complete contents of passwdfile as the
password for simple authentication.</p>

<p>-H ldapuri Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap
server(s); a list of URI, separated by whitespace or commas
is expected; only the proto- col/host/port fields are
allowed. As an exception, if no host/port is specified, but
a DN is, the DN is used to look up the corresponding host(s)
using the DNS SRV records, according to RFC 2782. The DN
must be a non-empty sequence of AVAs whose attribute type is
&quot;dc&quot; (domain component), and must be escaped
according to RFC 2396.</p>

<p>-h ldaphost Specify an alternate host on which the ldap
server is running. Deprecated in favor of -H.</p>

<p>-p ldapport Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap
server is listen- ing. Deprecated in favor of -H.</p>

<p>-P {2|3} Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.</p>

<p>-e [!]ext[=extparam]</p>

<p>-E [!]ext[=extparam]</p>

<p>Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions
with -E. &acute;!&acute; indicates criticality.</p>

<p>General extensions: [!]assert=&lt;filter&gt; (an RFC
4515 Filter) !authzid=&lt;authzid&gt;
(&quot;dn:&lt;dn&gt;&quot; or &quot;u:&lt;user&gt;&quot;)
[!]bauthzid (RFC 3829 authzid control)
[!]chaining[=&lt;resolve&gt;[/&lt;cont&gt;]] [!]manageDSAit
[!]noop ppolicy [!]postread[=&lt;attrs&gt;] (a
comma-separated attribute list) [!]preread[=&lt;attrs&gt;]
(a comma-separated attribute list) [!]relax sessiontracking
abandon,cancel,ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel, or
ignores response; if critical, doesnt wait for SIGINT. not
really controls)</p>

<p>Search extensions: !dontUseCopy [!]domainScope (domain
scope) [!]mv=&lt;filter&gt; (matched values filter)
[!]pr=&lt;size&gt;[/prompt|noprompt] (paged results/prompt)
[!]sss=[-]&lt;attr[:OID]&gt;[/[-]&lt;attr[:OID]&gt;...]
(server side sorting) [!]subentries[=true|false]
(subentries) [!]sync=ro[/&lt;cookie&gt;] (LDAP Sync
refreshOnly) rp[/&lt;cookie&gt;][/&lt;slimit&gt;] (LDAP Sync
refreshAndPersist)
[!]vlv=&lt;before&gt;/&lt;after&gt;(/&lt;offset&gt;/&lt;count&gt;|:&lt;value&gt;)
(virtual list view)
[!]deref=derefAttr:attr[,attr[...]][;derefAttr:attr[,attr[...]]]
[!]&lt;oid&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;]</p>

<p>-o opt[=optparam]</p>

<p>Specify general options.</p>

<p>General options: nettimeout=&lt;timeout&gt; (in seconds,
or &quot;none&quot; or &quot;max&quot;)
ldif-wrap=&lt;width&gt; (in columns, or &quot;no&quot; for
no wrapping)</p>

<p>-O security-properties Specify SASL security
properties.</p>

<p>-I Enable SASL Interactive mode. Always prompt. Default
is to prompt only as needed.</p>

<p>-Q Enable SASL Quiet mode. Never prompt.</p>

<p>-N Do not use reverse DNS to canonicalize SASL host
name.</p>

<p>-U authcid Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind.
The form of the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism
used.</p>

<p>-R realm Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL
bind. The form of the realm depends on the actual SASL
mechanism used.</p>

<p>-X authzid Specify the requested authorization ID for
SASL bind. authzid must be one of the following formats:
dn:&lt;distinguished name&gt; or u:&lt;username&gt;</p>

<p>-Y mech Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for
authentication. If its not specified, the program will
choose the best mechanism the server knows.</p>

<p>-Z[Z] Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
operation to be suc- cessful.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMAT If one or more entries are found, each
entry is written to standard output in LDAP Data Interchange
Format or ldif(5):</p>

<p>version: 1</p>

<p># bjensen, example, net dn:
uid=bjensen,dc=example,dc=net objectClass: person
objectClass: dcObject uid: bjensen cn: Barbara Jensen sn:
Jensen ...</p>

<p>If the -t option is used, the URI of a temporary file is
used in place of the actual value. If the -A option is
given, only the &quot;attributename&quot; part is
written.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following command:</p>

<p>ldapsearch -LLL &quot;(sn=smith)&quot; cn sn
telephoneNumber</p>

<p>will perform a subtree search (using the default search
base and other parameters defined in ldap.conf(5)) for
entries with a surname (sn) of smith. The common name (cn),
surname (sn) and telephoneNumber values will be retrieved
and printed to standard output. The output might look
something like this if two entries are found:</p>

<p>dn: uid=jts,dc=example,dc=com cn: John Smith cn: John T.
Smith sn: Smith sn;lang-en: Smith sn;lang-de: Schmidt
telephoneNumber: 1 555 123-4567</p>

<p>dn: uid=sss,dc=example,dc=com cn: Steve Smith cn: Steve
S. Smith sn: Smith sn;lang-en: Smith sn;lang-de: Schmidt
telephoneNumber: 1 555 765-4321</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>ldapsearch -LLL -u -t &quot;(uid=xyz)&quot; jpegPhoto
audio</p>

<p>will perform a subtree search using the default search
base for entries with user id of &quot;xyz&quot;. The user
friendly form of the entrys DN will be output after the line
that contains the DN itself, and the jpegPhoto and audio
values will be retrieved and written to temporary files. The
output might look like this if one entry with one value for
each of the requested attributes is found:</p>

<p>dn: uid=xyz,dc=example,dc=com ufn: xyz, example, com
audio:&lt; file:///tmp/ldapsearch-audio-a19924
jpegPhoto:&lt; file:///tmp/ldapsearch-jpegPhoto-a19924</p>

<p>This command:</p>

<p>ldapsearch -LLL -s one -b &quot;c=US&quot;
&quot;(o=University*)&quot; o description</p>

<p>will perform a one-level search at the c=US level for
all entries whose organization name (o) begins with
University. The organization name and description attribute
values will be retrieved and printed to stan- dard output,
resulting in output similar to this:</p>

<p>dn: o=University of Alaska Fairbanks,c=US o: University
of Alaska Fairbanks description: Preparing Alaska for a
brave new yesterday description: leaf node only</p>

<p>dn: o=University of Colorado at Boulder,c=US o:
University of Colorado at Boulder description: No personnel
information description: Institution of education and
research</p>

<p>dn: o=University of Colorado at Denver,c=US o:
University of Colorado at Denver o: UCD o: CU/Denver o:
CU-Denver description: Institute for Higher Learning and
Research</p>

<p>dn: o=University of Florida,c=US o: University of
Florida o: UFl description: Warper of young minds</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is zero if no errors occur.
Errors result in a non-zero exit status and a diagnostic
message being written to standard error.</p>
