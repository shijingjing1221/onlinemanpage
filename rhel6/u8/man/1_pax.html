<p>DESCRIPTION pax will read, write, and list the members
of an archive file, and will copy directory hierarchies. pax
operation is independent of the specific archive format, and
supports a wide variety of different archive formats. A list
of supported archive formats can be found under the
description of the -x option.</p>

<p>The presence of the -r and the -w options specifies
which of the follow- ing functional modes pax will operate
under: list, read, write, and copy.</p>

<p>&lt;none&gt; List. pax will write to standard output a
table of contents of the members of the archive file read
from standard input, whose pathnames match the specified
patterns. The table of contents contains one filename per
line and is written using single line buffering.</p>

<p>-r Read. pax extracts the members of the archive file
read from the standard input, with pathnames matching the
specified patterns. The archive format and blocking is
automatically determined on input. When an extracted file is
a directory, the entire file hierarchy rooted at that
directory is extracted. All extracted files are created
relative to the current file hierarchy. The setting of
ownership, access and modification times, and file mode of
the extracted files are discussed in more detail under the
-p option.</p>

<p>-w Write. pax writes an archive containing the file
operands to standard output using the specified archive
format. When no file operands are specified, a list of files
to copy with one per line is read from standard input. When
a file operand is also a directory, the entire file
hierarchy rooted at that directory will be included.</p>

<p>-r -w Copy. pax copies the file operands to the
destination directory. When no file operands are specified,
a list of files to copy with one per line is read from the
standard input. When a file operand is also a directory the
entire file hierarchy rooted at that directory will be
included. The effect of the copy is as if the copied files
were written to an archive file and then subse- quently
extracted, except that there may be hard links between the
original and the copied files (see the -l option below).</p>

<p>Warning: The destination directory must not be one of
the file operands or a member of a file hierarchy rooted at
one of the file operands. The result of a copy under these
conditions is unpredictable.</p>

<p>While processing a damaged archive during a read or list
operation, pax will attempt to recover from media defects
and will search through the archive to locate and process
the largest number of archive members pos- sible (see the -E
option for more details on error handling).</p>

<p>The directory operand specifies a destination directory
pathname. If the directory operand does not exist, or it is
not writable by the user, or it is not of type directory,
pax will exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The pattern operand is used to select one or more
pathnames of archive members. Archive members are selected
using the pattern matching nota- tion described by
fnmatch(3). When the pattern operand is not supplied, all
members of the archive will be selected. When a pattern
matches a directory, the entire file hierarchy rooted at
that directory will be selected. When a pattern operand does
not select at least one archive member, pax will write these
pattern operands in a diagnostic message to standard error
and then exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The file operand specifies the pathname of a file to be
copied or archived. When a file operand does not select at
least one archive mem- ber, pax will write these file
operand pathnames in a diagnostic message to standard error
and then exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-r Read an archive file from standard input and extract
the speci- fied files. If any intermediate directories are
needed in order to extract an archive member, these
directories will be created as if mkdir(2) was called with
the bitwise inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as
the mode argument. When the selected archive format supports
the specification of linked files and these files cannot be
linked while the archive is being extracted, pax will write
a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a
non-zero exit status at the completion of opera- tion.</p>

<p>-w Write files to the standard output in the specified
archive for- mat. When no file operands are specified,
standard input is read for a list of pathnames with one per
line without any leading or trailing blanks.</p>

<p>-a Append files to the end of an archive that was
previously writ- ten. If an archive format is not specified
with a -x option, the format currently being used in the
archive will be selected. Any attempt to append to an
archive in a format different from the format already used
in the archive will cause pax to exit immedi- ately with a
non-zero exit status. The blocking size used in the archive
volume where writing starts will continue to be used for the
remainder of that archive volume.</p>

<p>Warning: Many storage devices are not able to support
the opera- tions necessary to perform an append operation.
Any attempt to append to an archive stored on such a device
may damage the archive or have other unpredictable results.
Tape drives in par- ticular are more likely to not support
an append operation. An archive stored in a regular file
system file or on a disk device will usually support an
append operation.</p>

<p>-0 Use the NUL ( ) character as a pathname terminator,
instead of ). This applies only to the pathnames read from
newline ( 0 standard input in the write and copy modes, and
to the pathnames written to standard output in list mode.
This option is expected to be used in concert with the
-print0 function in find(1) or the -0 flag in xargs(1).</p>

<p>-b blocksize When writing an archive, block the output
at a positive decimal integer number of bytes per write to
the archive file. The blocksize must be a multiple of 512
bytes with a maximum of 64512 bytes. Archives larger than
32256 bytes violate the POSIX stan- dard and will not be
portable to all systems. A blocksize can end with k or b to
specify multiplication by 1024 (1K) or 512, respectively. A
pair of blocksizes can be separated by x to indicate a
product. A specific archive device may impose additional
restrictions on the size of blocking it will support. When
blocking is not specified, the default blocksize is depen-
dent on the specific archive format being used (see the -x
option).</p>

<p>-c Match all file or archive members except those
specified by the pattern and file operands.</p>

<p>-d Cause files of type directory being copied or
archived, or archive members of type directory being
extracted, to match only the directory file or archive
member and not the file hierarchy rooted at the
directory.</p>

<p>-f archive Specify archive as the pathname of the input
or output archive, overriding the default standard input
(for list and read) or standard output (for write). A single
archive may span multiple files and different archive
devices. When required, pax will prompt for the pathname of
the file or device of the next volume in the archive.</p>

<p>-i Interactively rename files or archive members. For
each archive member matching a pattern operand or each file
matching a file operand, pax will prompt to /dev/tty giving
the name of the file, its file mode, and its modification
time. pax will then read a line from /dev/tty. If this line
is blank, the file or archive member is skipped. If this
line consists of a single period, the file or archive member
is processed with no modification to its name. Otherwise,
its name is replaced with the contents of the line. pax will
immediately exit with a non-zero exit status if EOF is
encountered when reading a response or if /dev/tty cannot be
opened for reading and writing.</p>

<p>-k Do not overwrite existing files.</p>

<p>-l (The lowercase letter ell.) Link files. In the copy
mode (-r -w), hard links are made between the source and
destination file hierarchies whenever possible.</p>

<p>-n Select the first archive member that matches each
pattern operand. No more than one archive member is matched
for each pattern. When members of type directory are
matched, the file hierarchy rooted at that directory is also
matched (unless -d is also specified).</p>

<p>-o options Information to modify the algorithm for
extracting or writing archive files which is specific to the
archive format specified by -x. In general, options take the
form: name=value.</p>

<p>-p string Specify one or more file characteristic
options (privileges). The string option-argument is a string
specifying file character- istics to be retained or
discarded on extraction. The string consists of the
specification characters a, e, m, o, and p. Mul- tiple
characteristics can be concatenated within the same string
and multiple -p options can be specified. The meaning of the
specification characters are as follows:</p>

<p>a Do not preserve file access times. By default, file
access times are preserved whenever possible.</p>

<p>e Preserve everything, the user ID, group ID, file mode
bits, file access time, and file modification time. This is
intended to be used by root, someone with all the
appropriate privileges, in order to preserve all aspects of
the files as they are recorded in the archive. The e flag is
the sum of the o and p flags.</p>

<p>m Do not preserve file modification times. By default,
file modification times are preserved whenever possible.</p>

<p>o Preserve the user ID and group ID.</p>

<p>p Preserve the file mode bits. This is intended to be
used by a user with regular privileges who wants to preserve
all aspects of the file other than the ownership. The file
times are preserved by default, but two other flags are
offered to disable this and use the time of extraction
instead.</p>

<p>In the preceding list, preserve indicates that an
attribute stored in the archive is given to the extracted
file, subject to the permissions of the invoking process.
Otherwise the attribute of the extracted file is determined
as part of the normal file creation action. If neither the e
nor the o specification char- acter is specified, or the
user ID and group ID are not preserved for any reason, pax
will not set the S_ISUID (setuid) and S_ISGID (setgid) bits
of the file mode. If the preservation of any of these items
fails for any reason, pax will write a diagnostic message to
standard error. Failure to preserve these items will affect
the final exit status, but will not cause the extracted file
to be deleted. If the file characteristic letters in any of
the string option-arguments are duplicated or conflict with
each other, the one(s) given last will take precedence. For
example, if -p eme is specified, file modification times are
still preserved.</p>

<p>-s replstr Modify the file or archive member names
specified by the pattern or file operands according to the
substitution expression replstr, using the syntax of the
ed(1) utility regular expres- sions. The format of these
regular expressions are: /old/new/[gp] As in ed(1), old is a
basic regular expression and new can con- (where n is a
digit) back-refer- tain an ampersand ( &amp; ), 0 ences, or
subexpression matching. The old string may also con- tain
newline characters. Any non-null character can be used as a
delimiter ( / is shown here). Multiple -s expressions can be
specified. The expressions are applied in the order they are
specified on the command line, terminating with the first
suc- cessful substitution. The optional trailing g continues
to apply the substitution expression to the pathname
substring which starts with the first character following
the end of the last successful substitution. The first
unsuccessful substitution stops the operation of the g
option. The optional trailing p will cause the final result
of a successful substitution to be written to standard error
in the following format: &lt;original pathname&gt; &gt;&gt;
&lt;new pathname&gt; File or archive member names that
substitute to the empty string are not selected and will be
skipped.</p>

<p>-t Reset the access times of any file or directory read
or accessed by pax to be the same as they were before being
read or accessed by pax.</p>

<p>-u Ignore files that are older (having a less recent
file modifica- tion time) than a pre-existing file or
archive member with the same name. During read, an archive
member with the same name as a file in the file system will
be extracted if the archive member is newer than the file.
During write, a file system member with the same name as an
archive member will be written to the archive if it is newer
than the archive member. During copy, the file in the
destination hierarchy is replaced by the file in the source
hierarchy or by a link to the file in the source hierarchy
if the file in the source hierarchy is newer.</p>

<p>-v During a list operation, produce a verbose table of
contents using the format of the ls(1) utility with the -l
option. For pathnames representing a hard link to a previous
member of the archive, the output has the format: &lt;ls -l
listing&gt; == &lt;link name&gt; For pathnames representing
a symbolic link, the output has the format: &lt;ls -l
listing&gt; =&gt; &lt;link name&gt; Where &lt;ls -l
listing&gt; is the output format specified by the ls(1)
utility when used with the -l option. Otherwise for all the
other operational modes (read, write, and copy), pathnames
are written and flushed to standard error without a trailing
newline as soon as processing begins on that file or archive
member. The trailing newline is not buffered and is written
only after the file has been read or written.</p>

<p>-x format Specify the output archive format, with the
default format being ustar. pax currently supports the
following formats:</p>

<p>cpio The extended cpio interchange format specified in
the IEEE Std 1003.2 (POSIX.2 ) standard. The default
blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes. Inode and device
information about a file (used for detecting file hard links
by this format) which may be truncated by this format is
detected by pax and is repaired.</p>

<p>bcpio The old binary cpio format. The default blocksize
for this format is 5120 bytes. This format is not very
portable and should not be used when other formats are
available. Inode and device information about a file (used
for detecting file hard links by this format) which may be
truncated by this format is detected by pax and is
repaired.</p>

<p>sv4cpio The System V release 4 cpio. The default
blocksize for this format is 5120 bytes. Inode and device
information about a file (used for detecting file hard links
by this format) which may be truncated by this format is
detected by pax and is repaired.</p>

<p>sv4crc The System V release 4 cpio with file crc
checksums. The default blocksize for this format is 5120
bytes. Inode and device information about a file (used for
detecting file hard links by this format) which may be
truncated by this format is detected by pax and is
repaired.</p>

<p>tar The old BSD tar format as found in BSD4.3. The
default blocksize for this format is 10240 bytes. Pathnames
stored by this format must be 100 characters or less in
length (including the trailing character, which means that
filenames can have a maximum length of 99 charac- ters).
Only regular files, hard links, soft links, and directories
will be archived (other file system types are not
supported). For backwards compatibility with even older tar
formats, a -o option can be used when writing an archive to
omit the storage of directories. This option takes the form:
-o write_opt=nodir</p>

<p>ustar The extended tar interchange format specified in
the IEEE Std 1003.2 (POSIX.2) standard. The default
blocksize for this format is 10240 bytes. Filenames stored
by this format must be 100 characters or less in length
(including the trailing character, which means that
filenames can have a maximum length of 99 charac- ters).
Pathnames (directorynames + filenames) stored by this format
must be 250 characters or less in length.</p>

<p>pax will detect and report any file that it is unable to
store or extract as the result of any specific archive
format restric- tions. The individual archive formats may
impose additional restrictions on use. Typical archive
format restrictions include (but are not limited to): file
pathname length, file size, link pathname length, and the
type of the file.</p>

<p>-z Use gzip(1) to compress (decompress) the archive
while writing (reading). Incompatible with -a.</p>

<p>-B bytes Limit the number of bytes written to a single
archive volume to bytes. The bytes limit can end with m, k,
or b to specify multiplication by 1048576 (1M), 1024 (1K) or
512, respectively. A pair of bytes limits can be separated
by x to indicate a product.</p>

<p>Warning: Only use this option when writing an archive to
a device which supports an end of file read condition based
on last (or largest) write offset (such as a regular file or
a tape drive). The use of this option with a floppy or hard
disk is not recom- mended.</p>

<p>-D This option is the same as the -u option, except that
the file inode change time is checked instead of the file
modification time. The file inode change time can be used to
select files whose inode information (e.g., UID, GID, etc.)
is newer than a copy of the file in the destination
directory.</p>

<p>-E limit Limit the number of consecutive read faults
while trying to read a flawed archive to limit. With a
positive limit, pax will attempt to recover from an archive
read error and will continue processing starting with the
next file stored in the archive. A limit of 0 will cause pax
to stop operation after the first read error is detected on
an archive volume. A limit of NONE will cause pax to attempt
to recover from read errors forever. The default limit is a
small positive number of retries.</p>

<p>Warning: Using this option with NONE should be used with
extreme caution as pax may get stuck in an infinite loop on
a very badly flawed archive.</p>

<p>-G group Select a file based on its group name, or when
starting with a #, a numeric gid. A can be used to escape
the #. Multiple -G options may be supplied and checking
stops with the first match.</p>

<p>-H Follow only command-line symbolic links while
performing a physi- cal file system traversal.</p>

<p>-L Follow all symbolic links to perform a logical file
system traversal.</p>

<p>-O Force the archive to be one volume. If a volume ends
prema- turely, pax will not prompt for a new volume. This
option can be useful for automated tasks where error
recovery cannot be per- formed by a human.</p>

<p>-P Do not follow symbolic links, perform a physical file
system traversal. This is the default mode.</p>

<p>-T [from_date][,to_date][/[c][m]] Allow files to be
selected based on a file modification or inode change time
falling within a specified time range of from_date to
to_date (the dates are inclusive). If only a from_date is
sup- plied, all files with a modification or inode change
time equal to or younger are selected. If only a to_date is
supplied, all files with a modification or inode change time
equal to or older will be selected. When the from_date is
equal to the to_date, only files with a modification or
inode change time of exactly that time will be selected.</p>

<p>When pax is in the write or copy mode, the optional
trailing field [c][m] can be used to determine which file
time (inode change, file modification or both) are used in
the comparison. If neither is specified, the default is to
use file modification time only. The m specifies the
comparison of file modification time (the time when the file
was last written). The c specifies the comparison of inode
change time (the time when the file inode was last changed;
e.g., a change of owner, group, mode, etc). When c and m are
both specified, then the modification and inode change times
are both compared. The inode change time comparison is
useful in selecting files whose attributes were recently
changed or selecting files which were recently created and
had their modification time reset to an older time (as what
happens when a file is extracted from an archive and the
modification time is preserved). Time comparisons using both
file times is useful when pax is used to create a time based
incremental archive (only files that were changed during a
specified time range will be archived).</p>

<p>A time range is made up of six different fields and each
field must contain two digits. The format is:
[[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]HH]MM[.SS] Where cc is the first two digits
of the year (the century), yy is the last two digits of the
year, the first mm is the month (from 01 to 12), dd is the
day of the month (from 01 to 31), HH is the hour of the day
(from 00 to 23), MM is the minute (from 00 to 59), and SS is
the seconds (from 00 to 59). The minute field MM is
required, while the other fields are optional and must be
added in the following order: HH, dd, mm, yy, cc. The SS
field may be added independently of the other fields. Time
ranges are relative to the current time, so -T 1234/cm would
select all files with a modification or inode change time of
12:34 PM today or later. Multiple -T time range can be sup-
plied and checking stops with the first match.</p>

<p>-U user Select a file based on its user name, or when
starting with a #, a numeric UID. A can be used to escape
the #. Multiple -U options may be supplied and checking
stops with the first match.</p>

<p>-X When traversing the file hierarchy specified by a
pathname, do not descend into directories that have a
different device ID. See the st_dev field as described in
stat(2) for more information about device IDs.</p>

<p>-Y This option is the same as the -D option, except that
the inode change time is checked using the pathname created
after all the file name modifications have completed.</p>

<p>-Z This option is the same as the -u option, except that
the modifi- cation time is checked using the pathname
created after all the file name modifications have
completed.</p>

<p>The options that operate on the names of files or
archive members (-c, -i, -n, -s, -u, -v, -D, -G, -T, -U, -Y,
and -Z) interact as follows.</p>

<p>When extracting files during a read operation, archive
members are selected , based only on the user specified
pattern operands as modified by the -c, -n, -u, -D, -G, -T,
-U options. Then any -s and -i options will modify in that
order, the names of these selected files. Then the -Y and -Z
options will be applied based on the final pathname.
Finally, the -v option will write the names resulting from
these modifications.</p>

<p>When archiving files during a write operation, or
copying files during a copy operation, archive members are
selected, based only on the user specified pathnames as
modified by the -n, -u, -D, -G, -T, and -U options (the -D
option only applies during a copy operation). Then any -s
and -i options will modify in that order, the names of these
selected files. Then during a copy operation the -Y and the
-Z options will be applied based on the final pathname.
Finally, the -v option will write the names resulting from
these modifications.</p>

<p>When one or both of the -u or -D options are specified
along with the -n option, a file is not considered selected
unless it is newer than the file to which it is
compared.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT TMPDIR Path in which to store temporary
files.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES $ pax -w -f /dev/rst0 .</p>

<p>Copies the contents of the current directory to the
device /dev/rst0.</p>

<p>$ pax -v -f filename</p>

<p>Gives the verbose table of contents for an archive
stored in filename.</p>

<p>$ mkdir newdir; cd olddir; pax -rw . newdir</p>

<p>This sequence of commands will copy the entire olddir
directory hierarchy to newdir.</p>

<p>$ pax -r -s ,^//*usr//*,, -f a.pax</p>

<p>Reads the archive a.pax, with all files rooted in /usr
into the archive extracted relative to the current
directory.</p>

<p>$ pax -rw -i . dest_dir</p>

<p>Can be used to interactively select the files to copy
from the current directory to dest_dir.</p>

<p>$ pax -r -pe -U root -G bin -f a.pax</p>

<p>Extract all files from the archive a.pax which are owned
by root with group bin and preserve all file
permissions.</p>

<p>$ pax -r -w -v -Y -Z home /backup</p>

<p>Update (and list) only those files in the destination
directory /backup which are older (less recent inode change
or file modification times) than files with the same name
found in the source file tree home.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS pax will exit with one of the following
values:</p>

<p>0 All files were processed successfully.</p>

<p>1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>Whenever pax cannot create a file or a link when reading
an archive or cannot find a file when writing an archive, or
cannot preserve the user ID, group ID, or file mode when the
-p option is specified, a diagnostic message is written to
standard error and a non-zero exit status will be returned,
but processing will continue. In the case where pax cannot
create a link to a file, pax will not create a second copy
of the file.</p>

<p>If the extraction of a file from an archive is
prematurely terminated by a signal or error, pax may have
only partially extracted a file the user wanted.
Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and
directories may have incorrect file bits, and the
modification and access times may be wrong.</p>

<p>If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated
by a signal or error, pax may have only partially created
the archive which may violate the specific archive format
specification.</p>

<p>If while doing a copy, pax detects a file is about to
overwrite itself, the file is not copied, a diagnostic
message is written to standard error and when pax completes
it will exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>STANDARDS The pax utility is a superset of the IEEE Std
1003.2 ( POSIX.2) stan- dard. The options -B, -D, -E, -G,
-H, -L, -O, -P, -T, -U, -Y, -Z, the archive formats bcpio,
sv4cpio, sv4crc, tar, and the flawed archive han- dling
during list and read operations are extensions to the POSIX
stan- dard.</p>
