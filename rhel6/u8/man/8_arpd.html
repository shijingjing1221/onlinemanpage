<p>NAME arpd - userspace arp daemon.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Usage: arpd [ -lkh? ] [ -a N ] [ -b dbase ] [
-B number ] [ -f file ] [ -n time ] [ -R rate ] [
&lt;INTERFACES&gt; ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The arpd daemon collects gratuitous ARP
information, saving it on local disk and feeding it to the
kernel on demand to avoid redundant broad- casting due to
limited size of the kernel ARP cache.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h -? Print help</p>

<p>-l Dump the arpd database to stdout and exit. The output
consists of three columns: the interface index, the IP
address of the interface, and the MAC address of the
interface. Negative entries for dead hosts are also shown,
in this case the MAC address is replaced by the word FAILED
followed by a colon and the most recent time when the fact
that the host is dead was proven.</p>

<p>-f &lt;FILE&gt; Read and load an arpd database from FILE
in a text format simi- lar to that dumped by option -l. Exit
after load, possibly list- ing resulting database, if option
-l is also given. If FILE is -, stdin is read to get the ARP
table.</p>

<p>-b &lt;DATABASE&gt; the location of the database file.
The default location is /var/lib/arpd/arpd.db</p>

<p>-a &lt;NUMBER&gt; With this option, arpd not only
passively listens for ARP pack- ets on the interface, but
also sends broadcast queries itself. NUMBER is the number of
such queries to make before a destina- tion is considered
dead. When arpd is started as kernel helper (i.e. with
app_solicit enabled in sysctl or even with option -k)
without this option and still did not learn enough
information, you can observe 1 second gaps in service. Not
fatal, but not good.</p>

<p>-k Suppress sending broadcast queries by the kernel.
This option only makes sense together with option -a.</p>

<p>-n &lt;TIME&gt; Specifies the timeout of the negative
cache. When resolution fails, arpd suppresses further
attempts to resolve for this period. This option only makes
sense together with option -k. This timeout should not be
too much longer than the boot time of a typical host not
supporting gratuitous ARP. Default value is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>-R &lt;RATE&gt; Maximal steady rate of broadcasts sent
by arpd in packets per second. Default value is 1.</p>

<p>-B &lt;NUMBER&gt; The number of broadcasts sent by arpd
back to back. Default value is 3. Together with the -R
option, this option ensures that the number of ARP queries
that are broadcast does not exceed B+R*T over any interval
of time T.</p>

<p>&lt;INTERFACES&gt; is a list of names of networking
interfaces to watch. If no interfaces are given, arpd
monitors all the interfaces. In this case arpd does not
adjust sysctl parameters, it is assumed that the user does
this himself after arpd is started.</p>

<p>SIGNALS When arpd receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal,
it exits gracefully, syncing the database and restoring
adjusted sysctl parameters. On a SIGHUP it syncs the
database to disk. With SIGUSR1 it sends some statistics to
syslog. The effect of any other signals is undefined. In
particular, they may corrupt the database and leave the
sysctl parame- ters in an unpredictable state.</p>

<p>NOTE In order for arpd to be able to serve as ARP
resolver, the kernel must be compiled with the option
CONFIG_ARPD and, in the case when interface list in not
given on command line, variable app_solicit on interfaces of
interest should be in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*. If this is
not made arpd still collects gratuitous ARP information in
its database.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db Start arpd to collect
gratuitous ARP, but not messing with ker- nel
functionality.</p>

<p>killall arpd ; arpd -l -b /var/tmp/arpd.db Look at
result after some time.</p>

<p>arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 1 eth0 eth1 Enable kernel
helper, leaving leading role to kernel.</p>

<p>arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 3 -k eth0 eth1 Completely
replace kernel resolution on interfaces eth0 and eth1. In
this case the kernel still does unicast probing to val-
idate entries, but all the broadcast activity is suppressed
and made under authority of arpd.</p>

<p>This is the mode in which arpd normally is supposed to
work. It is not the default to prevent occasional enabling
of too aggressive a mode.</p>
