<p>BIND(2) Linux Programmer s Manual BIND(2)</p>

<p>NAME bind - bind a name to a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; /* See NOTES */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
socklen_t addrlen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a socket is created with socket(2), it
exists in a name space (address family) but has no address
assigned to it. bind() assigns the address specified to by
addr to the socket referred to by the file descriptor
sockfd. addrlen specifies the size, in bytes, of the address
structure pointed to by addr. Traditionally, this operation
is called assigning a name to a socket.</p>

<p>It is normally necessary to assign a local address using
bind() before a SOCK_STREAM socket may receive connections
(see accept(2)).</p>

<p>The rules used in name binding vary between address
families. Consult the manual entries in Section 7 for
detailed information. For AF_INET see ip(7), for AF_INET6
see ipv6(7), for AF_UNIX see unix(7), for AF_APPLETALK see
ddp(7), for AF_PACKET see packet(7), for AF_X25 see x25(7)
and for AF_NETLINK see netlink(7).</p>

<p>The actual structure passed for the addr argument will
depend on the address family. The sockaddr structure is
defined as something like:</p>

<p>struct sockaddr { sa_family_t sa_family; char
sa_data[14]; }</p>

<p>The only purpose of this structure is to cast the
structure pointer passed in addr in order to avoid compiler
warnings. See EXAMPLE below.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES The address is protected, and the user is
not the superuser.</p>

<p>EADDRINUSE The given address is already in use.</p>

<p>EBADF sockfd is not a valid descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The socket is already bound to an address.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK sockfd is a descriptor for a file, not a
socket.</p>

<p>The following errors are specific to Unix domain
(AF_UNIX) sockets:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix. (See also path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EADDRNOTAVAIL A nonexistent interface was requested or
the requested address was not local.</p>

<p>EFAULT addr points outside the user s accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL The addrlen is wrong, or the socket was not in
the AF_UNIX fam- ily.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving addr.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG addr is too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EROFS The socket inode would reside on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001 (bind() first
appeared in 4.2BSD).</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;, and this header file is not required on
Linux. However, some historical (BSD) implementations
required this header file, and portable applications are
probably wise to include it.</p>

<p>The third argument of bind() is in reality an int (and
this is what 4.x BSD and libc4 and libc5 have). Some POSIX
confusion resulted in the present socklen_t, also used by
glibc. See also accept(2).</p>

<p>BUGS The transparent proxy options are not
described.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE An example of the use of bind() with Internet
domain sockets can be found in getaddrinfo(3).</p>

<p>The following example shows how to bind a stream socket
in the Unix (AF_UNIX) domain, and accept connections:</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/un.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define MY_SOCK_PATH &quot;/somepath&quot; #define
LISTEN_BACKLOG 50</p>

<p>#define handle_error(msg) do { perror(msg);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } while (0)</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int sfd, cfd; struct
sockaddr_un my_addr, peer_addr; socklen_t
peer_addr_size;</p>

<p>sfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sfd == -1)
handle_error(&quot;socket&quot;);</p>

<p>memset(&amp;my_addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)); /*
Clear structure */ my_addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
strncpy(my_addr.sun_path, MY_SOCK_PATH,
sizeof(my_addr.sun_path) - 1);</p>

<p>if (bind(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;my_addr,
sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)) == -1)
handle_error(&quot;bind&quot;);</p>

<p>if (listen(sfd, LISTEN_BACKLOG) == -1)
handle_error(&quot;listen&quot;);</p>

<p>/* Now we can accept incoming connections one at a time
using accept(2) */</p>

<p>peer_addr_size = sizeof(struct sockaddr_un); cfd =
accept(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;peer_addr,
&amp;peer_addr_size); if (cfd == -1)
handle_error(&quot;accept&quot;);</p>

<p>/* Code to deal with incoming connection(s)... */</p>

<p>/* When no longer required, the socket pathname,
MY_SOCK_PATH should be deleted using unlink(2) or remove(3)
*/ }</p>
