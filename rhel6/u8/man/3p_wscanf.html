<p>FWSCANF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FWSCANF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fwscanf, swscanf, wscanf - convert formatted
wide-character input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fwscanf(FILE *restrict stream, const wchar_t
*restrict format, ... ); int swscanf(const wchar_t *restrict
ws, const wchar_t *restrict format, ... ); int wscanf(const
wchar_t *restrict format, ... );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fwscanf() function shall read from the
named input stream. The wscanf() function shall read from
the standard input stream stdin. The swscanf() function
shall read from the wide-character string ws. Each function
reads wide characters, interprets them according to a
format, and stores the results in its arguments. Each
expects, as arguments, a control wide-character string
format described below, and a set of pointer arguments
indicating where the converted input should be stored. The
result is undefined if there are insufficient arguments for
the format. If the format is exhausted while arguments
remain, the excess arguments are evaluated but are otherwise
ignored.</p>

<p>Conversions can be applied to the nth argument after the
format in the argument list, rather than to the next unused
argument. In this case, the conversion specifier wide
character % (see below) is replaced by the sequence
&quot;%n$&quot;, where n is a decimal integer in the range
[1,{NL_ARGMAX}]. This feature provides for the definition of
format wide-character strings that select arguments in an
order appropriate to specific languages. In format
wide-character strings containing the &quot;%n$&quot; form
of conversion specifications, it is unspecified whether num-
bered arguments in the argument list can be referenced from
the format wide-character string more than once.</p>

<p>The format can contain either form of a conversion
specification-that is, % or &quot;%n$&quot;- but the two
forms cannot normally be mixed within a single format
wide-character string. The only exception to this is that %%
or %* can be mixed with the &quot;%n$&quot; form. When
numbered argument spec- ifications are used, specifying the
Nth argument requires that all the leading arguments, from
the first to the ( N-1)th, are pointers.</p>

<p>The fwscanf() function in all its forms allows for
detection of a lan- guage-dependent radix character in the
input string, encoded as a wide- character value. The radix
character is defined in the programs locale (category
LC_NUMERIC ). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the
radix character is not defined, the radix character shall
default to a period (. ).</p>

<p>The format is a wide-character string composed of zero
or more direc- tives. Each directive is composed of one of
the following: one or more white-space wide characters (
&lt;space&gt;s, &lt;tab&gt;s, &lt;newline&gt;s,
&lt;vertical- tab&gt;s, or &lt;form-feed&gt;s); an ordinary
wide character (neither%nor a white-space character); or a
conversion specification. Each conversion specification is
introduced by a % or the sequence &quot;%n$&quot; after
which the following appear in sequence:</p>

<p>* An optional assignment-suppressing character*.</p>

<p>* An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies
the maximum field width.</p>

<p>* An optional length modifier that specifies the size of
the receiving object.</p>

<p>* A conversion specifier wide character that specifies
the type of conversion to be applied. The valid conversion
specifiers are described below.</p>

<p>The fwscanf() functions shall execute each directive of
the format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below,
the function shall return. Failures are described as input
failures (due to the unavail- ability of input bytes) or
matching failures (due to inappropriate input).</p>

<p>A directive composed of one or more white-space wide
characters is exe- cuted by reading input until no more
valid input can be read, or up to the first wide character
which is not a white-space wide character, which remains
unread.</p>

<p>A directive that is an ordinary wide character shall be
executed as follows. The next wide character is read from
the input and compared with the wide character that
comprises the directive; if the comparison shows that they
are not equivalent, the directive shall fail, and the
differing and subsequent wide characters remain unread.
Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read
error prevents a wide charac- ter from being read, the
directive shall fail.</p>

<p>A directive that is a conversion specification defines a
set of match- ing input sequences, as described below for
each conversion wide char- acter. A conversion specification
is executed in the following steps.</p>

<p>Input white-space wide characters (as specified by
iswspace() ) shall be skipped, unless the conversion
specification includes a [, c, or n conversion
specifier.</p>

<p>An item shall be read from the input, unless the
conversion specifica- tion includes an n conversion
specifier wide character. An input item is defined as the
longest sequence of input wide characters, not exceeding any
specified field width, which is an initial subsequence of a
matching sequence. The first wide character, if any, after
the input item shall remain unread. If the length of the
input item is zero, the execution of the conversion
specification shall fail; this condition is a matching
failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read
error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is
an input failure.</p>

<p>Except in the case of a % conversion specifier, the
input item (or, in the case of a %n conversion
specification, the count of input wide characters) shall be
converted to a type appropriate to the conversion wide
character. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the
exe- cution of the conversion specification shall fail; this
condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment
suppression was indicated by a, the result of the conversion
shall be placed in the object pointed to by the first
argument following the format argument that has not already
received a conversion result if the conversion specification
is introduced by %, or in the nth argument if introduced by
the wide- character sequence &quot;%n$&quot;. If this object
does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the
conversion cannot be represented in the space provided, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The length modifiers and their meanings are:</p>

<p>hh Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to signed char or unsigned char.</p>

<p>h Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to short or unsigned short.</p>

<p>l (ell) Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or
n conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to long or unsigned long; that a following a, A, e,
E, f, F, g, or G con- version specifier applies to an
argument with type pointer to double; or that a following c,
s, or [ conversion specifier applies to an argument with
type pointer to wchar_t.</p>

<p>ll (ell-ell)</p>

<p>Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to long long or unsigned long long.</p>

<p>j Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to intmax_t or uintmax_t.</p>

<p>z Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to size_t or the corresponding signed integer
type.</p>

<p>t Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to ptrdiff_t or the corresponding unsigned type.</p>

<p>L Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to long dou- ble.</p>

<p>If a length modifier appears with any conversion
specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>The following conversion specifier wide characters are
valid:</p>

<p>d Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose
format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of
wcstol() with the value 10 for the base argument. In the
absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to int.</p>

<p>i Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is
the same as expected for the subject sequence of wcstol()
with 0 for the base argument. In the absence of a size
modifier, the applica- tion shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to int.</p>

<p>o Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose
format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of
wcstoul() with the value 8 for the base argument. In the
absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to
unsigned.</p>

<p>u Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose
format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of
wcstoul() with the value 10 for the base argument. In the
absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to
unsigned.</p>

<p>x Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer,
whose format is the same as expected for the subject
sequence of wcstoul() with the value 16 for the base
argument. In the absence of a size modifier, the application
shall ensure that the correspond- ing argument is a pointer
to unsigned.</p>

<p>a, e, f, g</p>

<p>Matches an optionally signed floating-point number,
infinity, or NaN whose format is the same as expected for
the subject sequence of wcstod(). In the absence of a size
modifier, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to float.</p>

<p>If the fwprintf() family of functions generates
character string repre- sentations for infinity and NaN (a
symbolic entity encoded in floating- point format) to
support IEEE Std 754-1985, the fwscanf() family of functions
shall recognize them as input.</p>

<p>s Matches a sequence of non white-space wide characters.
If no l (ell) qualifier is present, characters from the
input field shall be converted as if by repeated calls to
the wcrtomb() function, with the conversion state described
by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero before the first
wide character is converted. The application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a character
array large enough to accept the sequence and the
terminating null character, which shall be added
automatically.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to an array of wchar_t
large enough to accept the sequence and the terminating null
wide character, which shall be added automati- cally.</p>

<p>[ Matches a non-empty sequence of wide characters from a
set of expected wide characters (the scanset). If no l (ell)
qualifier is present, wide characters from the input field
shall be con- verted as if by repeated calls to the
wcrtomb() function, with the conversion state described by
an mbstate_t object initial- ized to zero before the first
wide character is converted. The application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a character
array large enough to accept the sequence and the
terminating null character, which shall be added auto-
matically.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the application
shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to
an array of wchar_t large enough to accept the sequence and
the terminating null wide character, which shall be added
automatically.</p>

<p>The conversion specification includes all subsequent
wide characters in the format string up to and including the
matching right square bracket (]). The wide characters
between the square brackets (the scanlist) comprise the
scanset, unless the wide character after the left square
bracket is a circumflex (^), in which case the scanset
contains all wide characters that do not appear in the
scanlist between the circum- flex and the right square
bracket. If the conversion specification begins with
&quot;[]&quot; or &quot;[^]&quot;, the right square bracket
is included in the scanlist and the next right square
bracket is the matching right square bracket that ends the
conversion specification; otherwise, the first right square
bracket is the one that ends the conversion specification.
If a - is in the scanlist and is not the first wide
character, nor the second where the first wide character is
a, nor the last wide character, the behavior is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>c Matches a sequence of wide characters of exactly the
number specified by the field width (1 if no field width is
present in the conversion specification).</p>

<p>If no l (ell) length modifier is present, characters
from the input field shall be converted as if by repeated
calls to the wcrtomb() func- tion, with the conversion state
described by an mbstate_t object ini- tialized to zero
before the first wide character is converted. The
corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial
element of a character array large enough to accept the
sequence. No null character is added.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) length modifier is present, the
corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial
element of an array of wchar_t large enough to accept the
sequence. No null wide character is added.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to an array of wchar_t
large enough to accept the sequence. No null wide character
is added.</p>

<p>p Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences,
which shall be the same as the set of sequences that is
produced by the %p conversion specification of the
corresponding fwprintf() func- tions. The application shall
ensure that the corresponding argu- ment is a pointer to a
pointer to void. The interpretation of the input item is
implementation-defined. If the input item is a value
converted earlier during the same program execution, the
pointer that results shall compare equal to that value;
other- wise, the behavior of the %p conversion is
undefined.</p>

<p>n No input is consumed. The application shall ensure
that the cor- responding argument is a pointer to the
integer into which is to be written the number of wide
characters read from the input so far by this call to the
fwscanf() functions. Execution of a %n conversion
specification shall not increment the assignment count
returned at the completion of execution of the function. No
argument shall be converted, but one shall be consumed. If
the conversion specification includes an
assignment-suppressing wide character or a field width, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>C Equivalent to lc .</p>

<p>S Equivalent to ls .</p>

<p>% Matches a single%wide character; no conversion or
assignment shall occur. The complete conversion
specification shall be %% .</p>

<p>If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior
is undefined.</p>

<p>The conversion specifiers A, E, F, G, and X are also
valid and shall be equivalent to, respectively, a, e, f, g,
and x .</p>

<p>If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion
is terminated. If end-of-file occurs before any wide
characters matching the current conversion specification
(except for %n ) have been read (other than leading
white-space, where permitted), execution of the current
conver- sion specification shall terminate with an input
failure. Otherwise, unless execution of the current
conversion specification is terminated with a matching
failure, execution of the following conversion specifi-
cation (if any) shall be terminated with an input
failure.</p>

<p>Reaching the end of the string in swscanf() shall be
equivalent to encountering end-of-file for fwscanf().</p>

<p>If conversion terminates on a conflicting input, the
offending input shall be left unread in the input. Any
trailing white space (including &lt;newline&gt;) shall be
left unread unless matched by a conversion specifi- cation.
The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is
only directly determinable via the %n conversion
specification.</p>

<p>The fwscanf() and wscanf() functions may mark the
st_atime field of the file associated with stream for
update. The st_atime field shall be marked for update by the
first successful execution of fgetc(), fgetwc(), fgets(),
fgetws(), fread(), getc(), getwc(), getchar(), getwchar(),
gets(), fscanf(), or fwscanf() using stream that returns
data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the number of successfully matched and assigned
input items; this number can be zero in the event of an
early matching failure. If the input ends before the first
matching failure or conversion, EOF shall be returned. If a
read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is
set, EOF shall be returned, and errno shall be set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS For the conditions under which the fwscanf()
functions shall fail and may fail, refer to fgetwc().</p>

<p>In addition, fwscanf() may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ Input byte sequence does not form a valid
character.</p>

<p>EINVAL There are insufficient arguments.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The call:</p>

<p>int i, n; float x; char name[50]; n =
wscanf(L&quot;%d%f%s&quot;, &amp;i, &amp;x, name);</p>

<p>with the input line:</p>

<p>25 54.32E-1 Hamster</p>

<p>assigns to n the value 3, to i the value 25, to x the
value 5.432, and name contains the string
&quot;Hamster&quot; .</p>

<p>The call:</p>

<p>int i; float x; char name[50]; (void)
wscanf(L&quot;%2d%f%*d %[0123456789]&quot;, &amp;i, &amp;x,
name);</p>

<p>with input:</p>

<p>56789 0123 56a72</p>

<p>assigns 56 to i, 789.0 to x, skips 0123, and places the
string &quot;50&quot; in name. The next call to getchar()
shall return the charactera.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE In format strings containing the %
form of conversion specifications, each argument in the
argument list is used exactly once.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
