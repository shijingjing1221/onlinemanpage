<p>NAME findcon - SELinux file context search tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS findcon FCLIST [OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION findcon allows the user to search for files
with a specified context. Results can be filtered by object
class as described below.</p>

<p>FCLIST The findcon tool operates upon a file context
list source. There are three valid file context lists.</p>

<p>directory If FCLIST is a name of a directory then begin
the search at that directory and recurse within it. Be sure
there are no circular mounts within it.</p>

<p>file_contexts If FCLIST is the name of a file_contexts
file (e.g.,
/etc/selinux/strict/contexts/files/file_contexts) then open
that file and find matching entries.</p>

<p>database If FCLIST is the name of a database as created
by a previous run of indexcon or apol then open the database
and execute queries into it.</p>

<p>EXPRESSION The following options allow the user to
specify which files to print. A file must meet all specified
criteria. If no expression is provided, all files are
printed.</p>

<p>-t TYPE, --type=TYPE Search for files with a context
containing the type TYPE.</p>

<p>-u USER, --user=USER Search for files with a context
containing the user USER.</p>

<p>-r ROLE, --role=ROLE Search for files with a context
containing the role ROLE.</p>

<p>-m RANGE, --mls-range=RANGE Search for files with a
context with the MLS range of RANGE. Note that findcon
ignores the SELinux translation library, if present. In
addition, this flag is ignored if the FCLIST has no MLS
information.</p>

<p>--context=CONTEXT Search for files matching this partial
context. This flag over- rides -t, -u, -r, and -m.</p>

<p>-p PATH, --path=PATH Search for files which include
PATH.</p>

<p>-c CLASS, --class=CLASS Search only files of object
class CLASS.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following additional options are
available.</p>

<p>-R, --regex Search using regular expressions instead of
exact string match- ing. This option does not affect the
--class flag.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help information and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>PARTIAL CONTEXT The --context flag specifies a partial
context, which is a a colon sep- arated list of user, role,
and type. If the system supports MLS, the context may have a
fourth field that gives the range. If a field is not
specified or is the literal asterisk, then the query will
always match the field.</p>

<p>OBJECT CLASSES Valid object class strings are</p>

<p>block, char, dir, fifo, file, link, or sock.</p>

<p>NOTE The findcon utility always operates on
&quot;raw&quot; SELinux file contexts. If the system has an
installed translation library (i.e., libsetrans), those
translations are ignored in favor of reading the original
con- texts from the filesystem (if FCFILE is a
directory).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES findcon . Find every context in the current
directory and all of its sub- directories.</p>

<p>findcon -u user_u . Find every context whose user is
user_u in the current directory and all subdirectories.</p>

<p>findcon -u system_u -t bin_t file_contexts Find entries
user system_u and type bin_t within a file_contexts file,
assuming that file_contexts is a file contexts file.</p>

<p>findcon --context=system_u::bin_t file_contexts This is
equivalent to the previous example.</p>

<p>findcon --context=system_u:*:bin_t:* file_contexts This
is also equivalent to the above example.</p>
