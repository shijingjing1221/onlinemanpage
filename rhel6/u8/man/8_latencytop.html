<p>LATENCYTOP(8) LATENCYTOP(8)</p>

<p>NAME latencytop - a tool for developers to visualize
system latencies</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS latencytop [--unknown] [processes...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents briefly the
latencytop command.</p>

<p>latencytop is a Linux* tool for software developers
(both kernel and userspace), aimed at identifying where in
the system latency is happen- ing, and what kind of
operation/action is causing the latency to happen so that
the code can be changed to avoid the worst latency
hiccups.</p>

<p>LatencyTOP focuses on the cases where the applications
want to run and execute useful code, but theres some
resource thats not currently available (and the kernel then
blocks the process). This is done both on a system level and
on a per process level, so that you can see whats happening
to the system, and which process is suffering and/or causing
the delays.</p>

<p>You can walk the processes by using the cursor keys. If
you press s followed by a letter, then only active processes
starting with that lettter are displayed and walked. If you
press s followed by 0 then that filter is reset.</p>

at http://www.latencytop.org</p>
