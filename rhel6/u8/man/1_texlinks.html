engine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS texlinks [ OPTIONS... ] DIRECTORIES...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION texlinks is used to create or recreate
symbolic links from formats to engines according to the
information in fmtutil.cnf or a file specified with
--cnffile.</p>

<p>DIRECTORIES is an optional list of directories in which
to operate. If no directories are specified the list of
directories depends on the --multiplatform option.</p>

<p>--cnffile FILE or -f FILE use file as configuration file
(default: fmtutil.cnf)</p>

<p>--verbose or -v set verbose mode on (default: off)</p>

<p>--multiplatform or -m operate in all platform-specific
directories (default: operate only in the directory for this
platform)</p>

<p>--silent or -s silently skip over existing
scripts/binaries instead of printing a warning</p>

<p>FILES fmtutil.cnf default configuration file</p>
