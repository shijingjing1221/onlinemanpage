<p>GROFFER(1) GROFFER(1)</p>

<p>NAME groffer - display groff files and man pages on X
and tty</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groffer [option...] [--] [filespec...] groffer
-h|--help groffer -v|--version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groffer program is the easiest way to
use groff(1). It can display arbitrary documents written in
the groff language, see groff(7), or other roff languages,
see roff(7), that are compatible to the original troff
language. The groffer program also includes many of the
features for finding and displaying the Unix manual pages
(man pages), such that it can be used as a replacement for a
man(1) program. Moreover, com- pressed files that can be
handled by gzip(1) or bzip2(1) are decom- pressed
on-the-fly.</p>

<p>The normal usage is quite simple by supplying a file
name or name of a man page without further options. But the
option handling has many possibilities for creating special
behaviors. This can be done either in configuration files,
with the shell environment variable $GROFFER_OPT, or on the
command line.</p>

<p>The output can be generated and viewed in several
different ways avail- able for groff. This includes the
groff native X Window viewer gxditview(1), each Postcript,
pdf, or dvi display program, a web brows- er by generating
html in www mode, or several text modes in text termi-
nals.</p>

<p>Most of the options that must be named when running
groff directly are determined automatically for groffer, due
to the internal usage of the grog(1) program. But all parts
can also be controlled manually by ar- guments.</p>

<p>Several file names can be specified on the command line
arguments. They are transformed into a single document in
the normal way of groff.</p>

<p>Option handling is done in GNU style. Options and file
names can be mixed freely. The option -- closes the option
handling, all follow- ing arguments are treated as file
names. Long options can be abbrevi- ated in several
ways.</p>

<p>filespec arguments</p>

<p>The filespec parameters are all arguments that are
neither an option nor an option argument. They usually mean
a file name or a man page searching scheme.</p>

<p>In the following, the term section_extension is used. It
means a word that consists of a man section that is
optionally fol- lowed by an extension. The name of a man
section is a single character from [1-9on], the extension is
some word. The exten- sion is mostly lacking.</p>

<p>No filespec parameters means standard input.</p>

<p>- stands for standard input (can occur several
times).</p>

<p>filename the path name of an existing file.</p>

<p>man:name(section_extension) man:name.section_extension
name(section_extension) name.section_extension
section_extension name search the man page name in the
section with optional extension section_extension.</p>

<p>man:name man page in the lowest man section that has
name.</p>

<p>name if name is not an existing file search for the man
page name in the lowest man section.</p>

<p>OPTION DETAILS The groffer program can usually be run
with very few options. But for special purposes, it supports
many options. These can be classified in 5 option
classes.</p>

<p>All short options of groffer are compatible with the
short options of groff(1). All long options of groffer are
compatible with the long op- tions of man(1).</p>

<p>Arguments for long option names can be abbreviated in
several ways. First, the argument is checked whether it can
be prolonged as is. Fur- thermore, each minus sign - is
considered as a starting point for a new abbreviation. This
leads to a set of multiple abbreviations for a sin- gle
argument. For example, --de-n-f can be used as an
abbreviation for --debug-not-func, but --de-n works as well.
If the abbreviation of the argument leads to several
resulting options an error is raised.</p>

<p>groffer breaking Options As soon as one of these options
is found on the command line it is exe- cuted, printed to
standard output, and the running groffer is terminat- ed
thereafter. All other arguments are ignored.</p>

<p>-h | --help Print a helping information with a short
explanation of option sto standard output.</p>

<p>-v | --version Print version information to standard
output.</p>

<p>groffer Mode Options The display mode and the viewer
programs are determined by these op- tions. If none of these
mode and viewer options is specified groffer tries to find a
suitable display mode automatically. The default modes are
mode pdf, mode ps, mode html, mode x, and mode dvi in X
Window with different viewers and mode tty with device
latin1 under less on a ter- minal; other modes are tested if
the programs for the main default mode do not exist.</p>

<p>In X Window, many programs create their own window when
called. groffer can run these viewers as an independent
program in the back- ground. As this does not work in text
mode on a terminal (tty) there must be a way to know which
viewers are X Window graphical programs. The groffer script
has a small set of information on some viewer names. If a
viewer argument of the command-line chooses an element that
is kept as X Window program in this list it is treated as a
viewer that can run in the background. All other, unknown
viewer calls are not run in the background.</p>

<p>For each mode, you are free to choose whatever viewer
you want. That need not be some graphical viewer suitable
for this mode. There is a chance to view the output source;
for example, the combination of the options --mode=ps and
--ps-viewer=less shows the content of the Postscript output,
the source code, with the pager less.</p>

<p>--auto Equivalent to --mode=auto.</p>

<p>--default Reset all configuration from previously
processed command line options to the default values. This
is useful to wipe out all former options of the
configuration, in $GROFFER_OPT, and restart option
processing using only the rest of the command line.</p>

<p>--default-modes mode1,mode2,... Set the sequence of
modes for auto mode to the comma separated list given in the
argument. See --mode for details on modes. Display in the
default manner; actually, this means to try the modes x, ps,
and tty in this sequence.</p>

<p>--dvi Equivalent to --mode=dvi.</p>

<p>--dvi-viewer prog Choose a viewer program for dvi mode.
This can be a file name or a program to be searched in
$PATH. Known X Window dvi view- ers include xdvi(1) and
dvilx(1) In each case, arguments can be provided
additionally.</p>

<p>--groff Equivalent to --mode=groff.</p>

<p>--html Equivalent to --mode=html.</p>

<p>--html-viewer Choose a web browser program for viewing
in html mode. It can be the path name of an executable file
or a program in $PATH. In each case, arguments can be
provided additionally.</p>

<p>--mode value Set the display mode. The following mode
values are recognized:</p>

<p>auto Select the automatic determination of the display
mode. The sequence of modes that are tried can be set with
the --default-modes option. Useful for restoring the default
mode when a different mode was specified before.</p>

<p>dvi Display formatted input in a dvi viewer program. By
de- fault, the formatted input is displayed with the xdvi(1)
program. --dvi.</p>

<p>groff After the file determination, switch groffer to
process the input like groff(1) would do. This disables the
groffer viewing features.</p>

<p>html Translate the input into html format and display
the re- sult in a web browser program. By default, the
existence of a sequence of standard web browsers is tested,
start- ing with konqueror(1) and mozilla(1). The text html
viewer is lynx(1).</p>

<p>pdf Display formatted input in a PDF (Portable Document
For- mat) viewer program. By default, the input is formatted
by groff using the Postscript device, then it is trans-
formed into the PDF file format using gs(1), or ps2pdf(1).
If that s not possible, the Postscript mode (ps) is used
instead. Finally it is displayed using dif- ferent viewer
programs. pdf has a big advantage because the text is
displayed graphically and is searchable as well.</p>

<p>ps Display formatted input in a Postscript viewer
program. By default, the formatted input is displayed in one
of many viewer programs.</p>

<p>text Format in a groff text mode and write the result to
stan- dard output without a pager or viewer program. The
text device, latin1 by default, can be chosen with option
-T.</p>

<p>tty Format in a groff text mode and write the result to
stan- dard output using a text pager program, even when in X
Window.</p>

<p>www Equivalent to --mode=html.</p>

<p>x Display the formatted input in a native roff viewer.
By default, the formatted input is displayed with the
gxditview(1) program being distributed together with groff.
But the standard X Window tool xditview(1) can also be
chosen with the option --x-viewer. The default resolution is
75 dpi, but 100 dpi are also possible. The default groff
device for the resolution of 75 dpi is X75-12, for 100 dpi
it is X100. The corresponding groff intermediate output for
the actual device is generated and the result is displayed.
For a resolution of 100 dpi, the default width of the
geometry of the display program is chosen to 850 dpi.</p>

<p>X Equivalent to --mode=x.</p>

<p>The following modes do not use the groffer viewing
features. They are only interesting for advanced
applications.</p>

<p>groff Generate device output with plain groff without
using the special viewing features of groffer. If no device
was specified by option -T the groff default ps is
assumed.</p>

<p>source Output the roff source code of the input files
without further processing.</p>

<p>--pdf Equivalent to --mode=pdf.</p>

<p>--pdf-viewer prog Choose a viewer program for pdf mode.
This can be a file name or a program to be searched in
$PATH; arguments can be provided additionally.</p>

<p>--ps Equivalent to --mode=ps.</p>

<p>--ps-viewer prog Choose a viewer program for ps mode.
This can be a file name or a program to be searched in
$PATH. Common Postscript viewers inlude gv(1), ghostview(1),
and gs(1), In each case, arguments can be provided
additionally.</p>

<p>--source Equivalent --mode=source.</p>

<p>--text Equivalent to --mode=text.</p>

<p>--to-stdout The file for the chosen mode is generated
and its content is printed to standard output. It will not
be displayed in graphi- cal mode.</p>

<p>--tty Equivalent to --mode=tty.</p>

<p>--tty-viewer prog Choose a text pager for mode tty. The
standard pager is less(1). This option is eqivalent to man
option --pager=prog. The option argument can be a file name
or a program to be searched in $PATH; arguments can be
provided additionally.</p>

<p>--www Equivalent to --mode=html.</p>

<p>--www-viewer prog Equivalent to --html-viewer.</p>

<p>--X | --x Equivalent to --mode=x.</p>

<p>--X-viewer | --x-viewer prog Choose a viewer program for
x mode. Suitable viewer programs are gxditview(1) which is
the default and xditview(1). The ar- gument can be any
executable file or a program in $PATH; argu- ments can be
provided additionally.</p>

<p>-- Signals the end of option processing; all remaining
arguments are interpreted as filespec parameters.</p>

<p>Besides these, groffer accepts all short options that
are valid for the groff(1) program. All non-groffer options
are sent unmodified via grog to groff. So postprocessors,
macro packages, compatibility with clas- sical troff, and
much more can be manually specified.</p>

<p>Options related to groff All short options of groffer
are compatible with the short options of groff(1). The
following of groff options have either an additional special
meaning within groffer or make sense for normal usage.</p>

<p>Because of the special outputting behavior of the groff
option -Z groffer was designed to be switched into groff
mode ; the groffer view- ing features are disabled there.
The other groff options do not switch the mode, but allow to
customize the formatting process.</p>

<p>-a This generates an ascii approximation of output in
the text modes. That could be important when the text pager
has problems with control sequences in tty mode.</p>

<p>-m file Add file as a groff macro file. This is useful
in case it can- not be recognized automatically.</p>

<p>-P opt_or_arg Send the argument opt_or_arg as an option
or option argument to the actual groff postprocessor.</p>

<p>-T | --device devname This option determines groffs
output device. The most impor- tant devices are the text
output devices for referring to the different character
sets, such as ascii, utf8, latin1, and oth- ers. Each of
these arguments switches groffer into a text mode using this
device, to mode tty if the actual mode is not a text mode.
The following devname arguments are mapped to the
corresponding groffer --mode=devname option: dvi, html, and
ps. All X* arguments are mapped to mode x. Each other
devname argu- ment switches to mode groff using this
device.</p>

<p>-X is equivalent to groff -X. It displays the groff
intermediate output with gxditview. As the quality is
relatively bad this option is deprecated; use --X instead
because the x mode uses an X* device for a better
display.</p>

<p>-Z | --intermediate-output | --ditroff Switch into groff
mode and format the input with the groff in- termediate
output without postprocessing; see groff_out(5). This is
equivalent to option --ditroff of man, which can be used as
well.</p>

<p>All other groff options are supported by groffer, but
they are just transparently transferred to groff without any
intervention. The op- tions that are not explicitly handled
by groffer are transparently passed to groff. Therefore
these transparent options are not document- ed here, but in
groff(1). Due to the automatism in groffer, none of these
groff options should be needed, except for advanced
usage.</p>

<p>Options for man pages --apropos Start the apropos(1)
command or facility of man(1) for searching the filespec
arguments within all man page descriptions. Each filespec
argument is taken for search as it is; section specific
parts are not handled, such that 7 groff searches for the
two arguments 7 and groff, with a large result; for the
filespec groff.7 nothing will be found. The language locale
is handled only when the called programs do support this;
the GNU apropos and man -k do not. The display differs from
the apropos program by the following concepts:</p>

<p>&middot; Construct a groff frame similar to a man page
to the output of apropos,</p>

<p>&middot; each filespec argument is searched on its
own.</p>

<p>&middot; The restriction by --sections is handled as
well,</p>

<p>&middot; wildcard characters are allowed and handled
without a further option.</p>

<p>--apropos-data Show only the apropos descriptions for
data documents, these are the man(7) sections 4, 5, and 7.
Direct section declarations are ignored, wildcards are
accepted.</p>

<p>--apropos-devel Show only the apropos descriptions for
development documents, these are the man(7) sections 2, 3,
and 9. Direct section dec- larations are ignored, wildcards
are accepted.</p>

<p>--apropos-progs Show only the apropos descriptions for
documents on programs, these are the man(7) sections 1, 6,
and 8. Direct section dec- larations are ignored, wildcards
are accepted.</p>

<p>--whatis For each filespec argument search all man pages
and display their description or say that it is not a man
page. This is written from anew, so it differs from man s
whatis output by the following concepts</p>

<p>&middot; each retrieved file name is added,</p>

<p>&middot; local files are handled as well,</p>

<p>&middot; the language and system locale is
supported,</p>

<p>&middot; the display is framed by a groff output format
similar to a man page,</p>

<p>&middot; wildcard characters are allowed without a
further option.</p>

<p>The following options were added to groffer for choosing
whether the file name arguments are interpreted as names for
local files or as a search pattern for man pages. The
default is looking up for local files.</p>

<p>--man Check the non-option command line arguments
(filespecs) first on being man pages, then whether they
represent an existing file. By default, a filespec is first
tested whether it is an existing file.</p>

<p>--no-man | --local-file Do not check for man pages.
--local-file is the corresponding man option.</p>

<p>--no-special Disable former calls of --all, --apropos*,
and --whatis.</p>

<p>Long options taken over from GNU man The long options of
groffer were synchronized with the long options of GNU man.
All long options of GNU man are recognized, but not all of
these options are important to groffer, so most of them are
just ig- nored. These ignored man options are --catman,
--troff, and --update.</p>

<p>In the following, the man options that have a special
meaning for groffer are documented.</p>

<p>If your system has GNU man installed the full set of
long and short op- tions of the GNU man program can be
passed via the environment variable $MANOPT; see man(1).</p>

<p>--all In searching man pages, retrieve all suitable
documents instead of only one.</p>

<p>-7 | --ascii In text modes, display ASCII translation of
special characters for critical environment. This is
equivalent to groff -mt- ty_char; see groff_tmac(5).</p>

<p>--ditroff Produce groff intermediate output. This is
equivalent to groffer -Z.</p>

<p>--extension suffix Restrict man page search to file
names that have suffix appended to their section element.
For example, in the file name
/usr/share/man/man3/terminfo.3ncurses.gz the man page
extension is ncurses.</p>

<p>--locale language Set the language for man pages. This
has the same effect, but overwrites $LANG</p>

<p>--location Print the location of the retrieved files to
standard error.</p>

<p>--no-location Do not display the location of retrieved
files; this resets a former call to --location. This was
added by groffer.</p>

<p>--manpath dir1:dir2:..._ Use the specified search path
for retrieving man pages instead of the program defaults. If
the argument is set to the empty string &quot;&quot; the
search for man page is disabled.</p>

<p>--pager Set the pager program in tty mode; default is
less. This is equivalent to --tty-viewer.</p>

<p>--sections sec1:sec2:..._ Restrict searching for man
pages to the given sections, a colon- separated list.</p>

<p>--systems sys1,sys2,..._ Search for man pages for the
given operating systems; the argu- ment systems is a
comma-separated list.</p>

<p>--where Eqivalent to --location.</p>

<p>X Window Toolkit Options The following long options were
adapted from the corresponding X Window Toolkit options.
groffer will pass them to the actual viewer program if it is
an X Window program. Otherwise these options are ig-
nored.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these options use the old style of a
single minus for long options. For groffer that was changed
to the standard with using a double minus for long options,
for example, groffer uses the option --font for the X Window
option -font.</p>

<p>See X(1), X(7), and the documentation on the X Window
Toolkit options for more details on these options and their
arguments.</p>

<p>--background color Set the background color of the
viewer window.</p>

<p>--bd pixels This is equivalent to --bordercolor.</p>

<p>--bg color This is equivalent to --background.</p>

<p>--bw pixels This is equivalent to --borderwidth.</p>

<p>--bordercolor pixels Specifies the color of the border
surrounding the viewer window.</p>

<p>--borderwidth pixels Specifies the width in pixels of
the border surrounding the viewer window.</p>

<p>--display X-display Set the X Window display on which
the viewer program shall be started, see the X Window
documentation for the syntax of the argument.</p>

<p>--foreground color Set the foreground color of the
viewer window.</p>

<p>--fg color This is equivalent to -foreground.</p>

<p>--fn font_name This is equivalent to --font.</p>

<p>--font font_name Set the font used by the viewer window.
The argument is an X Window font name.</p>

<p>--ft font_name This is equivalent to --font.</p>

<p>--geometry size_pos Set the geometry of the display
window, that means its size and its starting position. See
X(7) for the syntax of the argument.</p>

<p>--resolution value Set X Window resolution in dpi (dots
per inch) in some viewer programs. The only supported dpi
values are 75 and 100. Actu- ally, the default resolution
for groffer is set to 75 dpi. The resolution also sets the
default device in mode x.</p>

<p>--rv Reverse foreground and background color of the
viewer window.</p>

<p>--title some text_ Set the title for the viewer
window.</p>

<p>--xrm resource_ Set X Window resource.</p>

<p>Options for Development --debug Enable seven debugging
informations. The temporary files are kept and not deleted,
the name of the temporary directory and the shell name for
groffer2.sh are printed, the displayed file names are
printed, the parameters are printed at several steps of
development, and a function stack is output with function
er- ror_user() as well. Neither the function call stack at
the opening and closing of each function call nor the
landmark in- formation to determine how far the program is
running are print- ed. These seem to be the most useful
parts among all debugging options.</p>

<p>--debug-all Enable all nine debugging informations
including the function call stack and the landmark
information.</p>

<p>--debug-filenames Print the names of the files and man
pages that are displayed by groffer.</p>

<p>--debug-func Enable the basic debugging information for
checking the func- tions on the beginning and end of each
call. The options --debug-stacks and --debug-user enable
this option automatical- ly. This option is important for
the development, but it de- creases the speed of groffer by
large amounts.</p>

<p>--debug-keep Enable two debugging informations, the
printing of the name of the temporary directory and the
keeping of the temporary files.</p>

<p>--debug-lm Enable one debugging information, the
landmark information.</p>

<p>--debug-params Enable one debugging information, the
parameters at several steps.</p>

<p>--debug-shell Enable one debugging information, the
shell name for groffer2.sh.</p>

<p>--debug-stacks Enable one debugging information, the
function call stack.</p>

<p>--debug-tmpdir Enable one debugging information, the
name of the temporary di- rectory.</p>

<p>--debug-user Enable one debugging information, the
function stack with er- ror_user().</p>

<p>--do-nothing This is like --version, but without the
output; no viewer is started. This makes only sense in
development.</p>

<p>--print=text Just print the argument to standard error.
This is good for pa- rameter check.</p>

<p>--shell shell_program Specify the shell under which the
groffer2.sh script should be run. This option overwrites the
automatic shell determination of the program. If the
argument shell_program is empty a former shell option and
the automatic shell determination is cancelled and the
default shell is restored. Some shells run considerably
faster than the standard shell.</p>

<p>-V This is an advanced option for debugging only.
Instead of dis- playing the formatted input, a lot of
groffer specific informa- tion is printed to standard
output:</p>

<p>&middot; the output file name in the temporary
directory,</p>

<p>&middot; the display mode of the actual groffer run,</p>

<p>&middot; the display program for viewing the output with
its arguments,</p>

<p>&middot; the active parameters from the config files,
the arguments in $GROFFER_OPT, and the arguments of the
command line,</p>

<p>&middot; the pipeline that would be run by the groff
program, but with- out executing it.</p>

<p>Other useful debugging options are the groff option -Z
and --mode=groff.</p>

<p>Filespec Arguments A filespec parameter is an argument
that is not an option or option ar- gument. In groffer,
filespec parameters are a file name or a template for
searching man pages. These input sources are collected and
com- posed into a single output file such as groff does.</p>

<p>The strange POSIX behavior to regard all arguments
behind the first non-option argument as filespec arguments
is ignored. The GNU behavior to recognize options even when
mixed with filespec arguments is used througout. But, as
usual, the double minus argument -- ends the option handling
and interprets all following arguments as filespec
arguments; so the POSIX behavior can be easily adopted.</p>

<p>The options have a special handling of filespec
arguments. Each argu- ment is taken as a search scheme of
its own. Also a regexp (regular expression) can be used in
the filespec. For example, groffer --apro- pos ^gro.f$
searches groff in the man page name, while groffer --apropos
groff searches groff somewhere in the name or description of
the man pages.</p>

<p>All other parts of groffer, such as the normal display
or the output with have a different scheme for filespecs. No
regular expressions are used for the arguments. The filespec
arguments are handled by the fol- lowing scheme.</p>

<p>It is necessary to know that on each system the man
pages are sorted according to their content into several
sections. The classical man sections have a single-character
name, either a digit from 1 to 9 or one of the characters n
or o.</p>

<p>This can optionally be followed by a string, the
so-called extension. The extension allows to store several
man pages with the same name in the same section. But the
extension is only rarely used, usually it is omitted. Then
the extensions are searched automatically by alphabet.</p>

<p>In the following, we use the name section_extension for
a word that consists of a single character section name or a
section character that is followed by an extension. Each
filespec parameter can have one of the following forms in
decreasing sequence.</p>

<p>&middot; No filespec parameters means that groffer waits
for standard input. The minus option - always stands for
standard input; it can occur several times. If you want to
look up a man page called - use the argument man:-.</p>

<p>&middot; Next a filespec is tested whether it is the
path name of an existing file. Otherwise it is assumed to be
a searching pattern for a man page.</p>

<p>&middot; man:name(section_extension),
man:name.section_extension, name(section_extension), or
name.section_extension search the man page name in man
section and possibly extension of section_extension.</p>

<p>&middot; Now man:name searches for a man page in the
lowest man section that has a document called name.</p>

<p>&middot; section_extension name is a pattern of 2
arguments that originates from a strange argument parsing of
the man program. Again, this searches the man page name with
section_extension, a combination of a section character
optionally followed by an extension.</p>

<p>&middot; We are left with the argument name which is not
an existing file. So this searches for the man page called
name in the lowest man section that has a document for this
name.</p>

<p>Several file name arguments can be supplied. They are
mixed by groff into a single document. Note that the set of
option arguments must fit to all of these file arguments. So
they should have at least the same style of the groff
language.</p>

<p>OUTPUT MODES By default, the groffer program collects
all input into a single file, formats it with the groff
program for a certain device, and then choos- es a suitable
viewer program. The device and viewer process in groffer is
called a mode. The mode and viewer of a running groffer
program is selected automatically, but the user can also
choose it with options. The modes are selected by option the
arguments of --mode=anymode. Ad- ditionally, each of this
argument can be specified as an option of its own, such as
--anymode. Most of these modes have a viewer program, which
can be chosen by an option that is constructed like
--anymode-viewer.</p>

<p>Several different modes are offered, graphical modes for
X Window, text modes, and some direct groff modes for
debugging and development.</p>

<p>By default, groffer first tries whether x mode is
possible, then ps mode, and finally tty mode. This mode
testing sequence for auto mode can be changed by specifying
a comma separated list of modes with the option
--default-modes.</p>

<p>The searching for man pages and the decompression of the
input are ac- tive in every mode.</p>

<p>Graphical Display Modes The graphical display modes work
mostly in the X Window environment (or similar
implementations within other windowing environments). The
en- vironment variable $DISPLAY and the option --display are
used for spec- ifying the X Window display to be used. If
this environment variable is empty groffer assumes that no X
Window is running and changes to a text mode. You can change
this automatic behavior by the option --default-modes.</p>

<p>Known viewers for the graphical display modes and their
standard X Window viewer progams are</p>

<p>&middot; in a PDF viewer (pdf mode),</p>

<p>&middot; in a web browser (html or www mode).</p>

<p>&middot; in a Postscript viewer (ps mode),</p>

<p>&middot; X Window roff viewers such as gxditview(1) or
xditview(1) (in x mode),</p>

<p>&middot; in a dvi viewer program (dvi mode),</p>

<p>The pdf mode has a major advantage it is the only
graphical diplay mode that allows to search for text within
the viewer; this can be a really important feature.
Unfortunately, it takes some time to trans- form the input
into the PDF format, so it was not chosen as the major
mode.</p>

<p>These graphical viewers can be customized by options of
the X Window Toolkit. But the groffer options use a leading
double minus instead of the single minus used by the X
Window Toolkit.</p>

<p>Text modes There are two modes for text output, mode
text for plain output without a pager and mode tty for a
text output on a text terminal using some pager program.</p>

<p>If the variable $DISPLAY is not set or empty, groffer
assumes that it should use tty mode.</p>

<p>In the actual implementation, the groff output device
latin1 is chosen for text modes. This can be changed by
specifying option -T or --device.</p>

<p>The pager to be used can be specified by one of the
options --pager and --tty-viewer, or by the environment
variable $PAGER. If all of this is not used the less(1)
program with the option -r for correctly display- ing
control sequences is used as the default pager.</p>

<p>Special Modes for Debugging and Development These modes
use the groffer file determination and decompression. This
is combined into a single input file that is fed directly
into groff with different strategy without the groffer
viewing facilities. These modes are regarded as advanced,
they are useful for debugging and de- velopment
purposes.</p>

<p>The source mode with option --source just displays the
decompressed in- put.</p>

<p>Otion --to-stdout does not display in a graphical mode.
It just gener- ates the file for the chosen mode and then
prints its content to stan- dard output.</p>

<p>The groff mode passes the input to groff using only some
suitable op- tions provided to groffer. This enables the
user to save the generated output into a file or pipe it
into another program.</p>

<p>In groff mode, the option -Z disables post-processing,
thus producing the groff intermediate output. In this mode,
the input is formatted, but not postprocessed; see
groff_out(5) for details.</p>

<p>All groff short options are supported by groffer.</p>

<p>MAN PAGE SEARCHING The default behavior of groffer is to
first test whether a file parame- ter represents a local
file; if it is not an existing file name, it is assumed to
represent the name of a man page. The following options can
be used to determine whether the arguments should be handled
as file name or man page arguments.</p>

<p>--man forces to interpret all file parameters as
filespecs for search- ing man pages.</p>

<p>--no-man --local-file disable the man searching; so only
local files are displayed.</p>

<p>If neither a local file nor a man page was retrieved for
some file pa- rameter a warning is issued on standard error,
but processing is con- tinued.</p>

<p>Search Algoritm Let us now assume that a man page should
be searched. The groffer pro- gram provides a search
facility for man pages. All long options, all environment
variables, and most of the functionality of the GNU man(1)
program were implemented. The search algorithm shall
determine which file is displayed for a given man page. The
process can be modified by options and environment
variables.</p>

<p>The only man action that is omitted in groffer are the
preformatted man pages, also called cat pages. With the
excellent performance of the actual computers, the
preformatted man pages arent necessary any longer.
Additionally, groffer is a roff program; it wants to read
roff source files and format them itself.</p>

<p>The algorithm for retrieving the file for a man page
needs first a set of directories. This set starts with the
so-called man path that is modified later on by adding names
of operating system and language. This arising set is used
for adding the section directories which con- tain the man
page files.</p>

<p>The man path is a list of directories that are separated
by colon. It is generated by the following methods.</p>

<p>&middot; The environment variable $MANPATH can be
set.</p>

<p>&middot; It can be read from the arguments of the
environment variable $MANOPT.</p>

<p>&middot; The man path can be manually specified by using
the option --manpath. An empty argument disables the man
page searching.</p>

<p>&middot; When no man path was set the manpath(1) program
is tried to determine one.</p>

<p>&middot; If this does not work a reasonable default path
from $PATH is deter- mined.</p>

<p>We now have a starting set of directories. The first way
to change this set is by adding names of operating systems.
This assumes that man pages for several operating systems
are installed. This is not al- ways true. The names of such
operating systems can be provided by 3 methods.</p>

<p>&middot; The environment variable $SYSTEM has the lowest
precedence.</p>

<p>&middot; This can be overridden by an option in
$MANOPT.</p>

<p>&middot; This again is overridden by the command line
option --systems.</p>

<p>Several names of operating systems can be given by
appending their names, separated by a comma.</p>

<p>The man path is changed by appending each system name as
subdirectory at the end of each directory of the set. No
directory of the man path set is kept. But if no system name
is specified the man path is left unchanged.</p>

<p>After this, the actual set of directories can be changed
by language information. This assumes that there exist man
pages in different lan- guages. The wanted language can be
chosen by several methods.</p>

<p>&middot; Enviroment variable $LANG.</p>

<p>&middot; This is overridden by $LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p>&middot; This is overridden by $LC_ALL.</p>

<p>&middot; This can be overridden by providing an option
in $MANOPT.</p>

<p>&middot; All these environment variables are overridden
by the command line option --locale.</p>

<p>The default language can be specified by specifying one
of the pseudo- language parameters C or POSIX. This is like
deleting a formerly given language information. The man
pages in the default language are usual- ly in English.</p>

<p>Of course, the language name is determined by man. In
GNU man, it is specified in the POSIX 1003.1 based
format:</p>


<p>&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;[.&lt;character-set&gt;[,&lt;version&gt;]]],</p>

<p>but the two-letter code in &lt;language&gt; is
sufficient for most purposes. If for a complicated language
formulation no man pages are found groffer searches the
country part consisting of these first two charac- ters as
well.</p>

<p>The actual directory set is copied thrice. The language
name is ap- pended as subdirectory to each directory in the
first copy of the actu- al directory set (this is only done
when a language information is giv- en). Then the 2-letter
abbreviation of the language name is appended as
subdirectories to the second copy of the directory set (this
is only done when the given language name has more than 2
letters). The third copy of the directory set is kept
unchanged (if no language information is given this is the
kept directory set). These maximally 3 copies are appended
to get the new directory set.</p>

<p>We now have a complete set of directories to work with.
In each of these directories, the man files are separated in
sections. The name of a section is represented by a single
character, a digit between 1 and 9, or the character o or n,
in this order.</p>

<p>For each available section, a subdirectory
man&lt;section&gt; exists contain- ing all man files for
this section, where &lt;section&gt; is a single charac- ter
as described before. Each man file in a section directory
has the form
man&lt;section&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.&lt;section&gt;[&lt;extension&gt;][.&lt;compression&gt;],
where &lt;extension&gt; and &lt;compression&gt; are
optional. &lt;name&gt; is the name of the man page that is
also specified as filespec argument on the command line.</p>

<p>The extension is an addition to the section. This
postfix acts like a subsection. An extension occurs only in
the file name, not in name of the section subdirectory. It
can be specified on the command line.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the compression is just an
information on how the file is compressed. This is not
important for the user, such that it cannot be specified on
the command line.</p>

<p>There are 4 methods to specify a section on the command
line:</p>

<p>&middot; Environment variable $MANSECT</p>

<p>&middot; Command line option --sections</p>

<p>&middot; Appendix to the name argument in the form
&lt;name&gt;.&lt;section&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; Preargument before the name argument in the
form &lt;section&gt; &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>It is also possible to specify several sections by
appending the single characters separated by colons. One can
imagine that this means to re- strict the man page search to
only some sections. The multiple sec- tions are only
possible for $MANSECT and --sections.</p>

<p>If no section is specified all sections are searched one
after the oth- er in the given order, starting with section
1, until a suitable file is found.</p>

<p>There are 4 methods to specify an extension on the
command line. But it is not necessary to provide the whole
extension name, some abbrevia- tion is good enough in most
cases.</p>

<p>&middot; Environment variable $EXTENSION</p>

<p>&middot; Command line option --extension</p>

<p>&middot; Appendix to the &lt;name&gt;.&lt;section&gt;
argument in the form &lt;name&gt;.&lt;sec-
tion&gt;&lt;extension&gt;</p>

<p>&middot; Preargument before the name argument in the
form &lt;section&gt;&lt;extension&gt; &lt;name&gt;</p>

man(1).</p>

<p>Examples of man files /usr/share/man/man1/groff.1 This
is an uncompressed file for the man page groff in sec- tion
1. It can be called by sh# groffer groff No section is
specified here, so all sections should be searched, but as
section 1 is searched first this file will be found first.
The file name is composed of the following compo- nents.
/usr/share/man must be part of the man path; the subdi-
rectory man1/ and the part .1 stand for the section; groff
is the name of the man page.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share/man/man7/groff.7.gz The file name is
composed of the following components. /usr/local/share/man
must be part of the man path; the subdirec- tory man7/ and
the part .7 stand for the section; groff is the name of the
man page; the final part .gz stands for a compres- sion with
gzip(1). As the section is not the first one it must be
specified as well. This can be done by one of the following
commands. sh# groffer groff.7 sh# groffer 7 groff sh#
groffer --sections=7 groff</p>

<p>/usr/local/man/man1/ctags.1emacs21.bz2 Here
/usr/local/man must be in man path; the subdirectory man1/
and the file name part .1 stand for section 1; the name of
the man page is ctags; the section has an extension emacs21;
and the file is compressed as .bz2 with bzip2(1). The file
can be viewed with one of the following commands sh# groffer
ctags.1e sh# groffer 1e ctags sh# groffer --extension=e
--sections=1 ctags where e works as an abbreviation for the
extension emacs21.</p>

<p>/usr/man/linux/de/man7/man.7.Z The directory /usr/man is
now part of the man path; then there is a subdirectory for
an operating system name linux/; next comes a subdirectory
de/ for the German language; the section names man7 and .7
are known so far; man is the name of the man page; and .Z
signifies the compression that can be handled by gzip(1). We
want now show how to provide several values for some
options. That is possible for sections and operating sys-
tem names. So we use as sections 5 and 7 and as system names
linux and aix. The command is then sh# groffer --locale=de
--sections=5:7 --systems=linux,aix man sh# LANG=de
MANSECT=5:7 SYSTEM=linux,aix groffer man</p>

<p>DECOMPRESSION The program has a decompression facility.
If standard input or a file that was retrieved from the
command line parameters is compressed with a format that is
supported by either gzip(1) or bzip2(1) it is decom- pressed
on-the-fly. This includes the GNU .gz, .bz2, and the tradi-
tional .Z compression. The program displays the
concatenation of all decompressed input in the sequence that
was specified on the command line.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The groffer program supports many system
variables, most of them by courtesy of other programs. All
environment variables of groff(1) and GNU man(1) and some
standard system variables are honored.</p>

<p>Native groffer Variables $GROFFER_OPT Store options for
a run of groffer. The options specified in this variable are
overridden by the options given on the command line. The
content of this variable is run through the shell builtin
eval; so arguments containing white-space or special shell
characters should be quoted. Do not forget to export this
variable, otherwise it does not exist during the run of
groffer.</p>

<p>System Variables The groffer program is a shell script
that is run through /bin/sh, which can be internally linked
to programs like bash(1). The corre- sponding system
environment is automatically effective. The following
variables have a special meaning for groffer.</p>

<p>$DISPLAY If this variable is set this indicates that the
X Window system is running. Testing this variable decides on
whether graphical or text output is generated. This variable
should not be changed by the user carelessly, but it can be
used to start the graphical groffer on a remote X Window
terminal. For example, depending on your system, groffer can
be started on the second monitor by the command sh#
DISPLAY=:0.1 groffer what.ever&amp;</p>

<p>$LC_ALL $LC_MESSAGES $LANG If one of these variables is
set (in the above sequence), its content is interpreted as
the locale, the language to be used, especially when
retrieving IR man pages . A locale name is typ- ically of
the form language[_territory[.codeset[@modifier]]], where
language is an ISO 639 language code, territory is an ISO
3166 country code, and codeset is a character set or
encoding identifier like ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8; see
setlocale(3). The lo- cale values C and POSIX stand for the
default, i.e. the man page directories without a language
prefix. This is the same behav- ior as when all 3 variables
are unset.</p>

<p>$PAGER This variable can be used to set the pager for
the tty output. For example, to disable the use of a pager
completely set this variable to the cat(1) program sh#
PAGER=cat groffer anything</p>

<p>$PATH All programs within the groffer shell script are
called without a fixed path. Thus this environment variable
determines the set of programs used within the run of
groffer.</p>

<p>Groff Variables The groffer program internally calls
groff, so all environment vari- ables documented in groff(1)
are internally used within groffer as well. The following
variable has a direct meaning for the groffer pro- gram.</p>

<p>$GROFF_TMPDIR If the value of this variable is an
existing, writable directo- ry, groffer uses it for storing
its temporary files, just as groff does.</p>

<p>Man Variables Parts of the functionality of the man
program were implemented in groffer; support for all
environment variables documented in man(1) was added to
groffer, but the meaning was slightly modified due to the
dif- ferent approach in groffer; but the user interface is
the same. The man environment variables can be overwritten
by options provided with $MANOPT, which in turn is
overwritten by the command line.</p>

<p>$EXTENSION Restrict the search for man pages to files
having this exten- sion. This is overridden by option
--extension; see there for details.</p>

<p>$MANOPT This variable contains options as a preset for
man(1). As not all of these are relevant for groffer only
the essential parts of its value are extracted. The options
specified in this vari- able overwrite the values of the
other environment variables that are specific to man. All
options specified in this vari- able are overridden by the
options given on the command line.</p>

<p>$MANPATH If set, this variable contains the directories
in which the man page trees are stored. This is overridden
by option --manpath.</p>

<p>$MANSECT If this is a colon separated list of section
names, the search for man pages is restricted to those
manual sections in that or- der. This is overridden by
option --sections.</p>

<p>$SYSTEM If this is set to a comma separated list of
names these are in- terpreted as man page trees for
different operating systems. This variable can be
overwritten by option --systems; see there for details.</p>

<p>The environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is ignored by
groffer because the necessary preprocessors are determined
automatically.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILES The groffer program can be
preconfigured by two configuration files.</p>

<p>/etc/groff/groffer.conf System-wide configuration file
for groffer.</p>

<p>$HOME/.groff/groffer.conf User-specific configuration
file for groffer, where $HOME de- notes the users home
directory. This file is called after the system-wide
configuration file to enable overriding by the user.</p>

<p>Both files are handled for the configuration, but the
configuration file in /etc comes first; it is overwritten by
the configuration file in the home directory; both
configuration files are overwritten by the environment
variable $GROFFER_OPT; everything is overwritten by the
command line arguments.</p>

<p>In the configuration files, arbitrary spaces are allowed
at the begin- ning of each line, they are just ignored.
Apart from that, the lines of the configuration lines either
start with a minus character, all other lines are
interpreted as shell commands.</p>

<p>The lines with the beginning minus are interpreted as
groffer options. This easily allows to set general groffer
options that should be used with any call of groffer.</p>

<p>If a lines starts with a double minus it represents a
groffer long op- tion; everything behind the first equal
sign = or space character up to the end of the line is
interpreted as its argument. A line starting with a single
minus represents a short options cluster with or without a
final argument. It is not necessary to use quotes in these
lines; quotes are just ignored.</p>

<p>The lines starting with a minus are changed into a
prepend to the ex- isting value of $GROFFER_OPT. So the
configuration files will be transferred into a shell script
that is called within groffer.</p>

<p>It makes sense to use these configuration files for the
following tasks:</p>

<p>&middot; Preset command line options, such as choosing a
mode or a viewer. These are written into lines starting with
a single or double minus sign, followed by the option
name.</p>

<p>&middot; Preset environment variables recognized by
groffer; but do not forget to export them.</p>

<p>&middot; You can also write a shell function for
calling, for example a viewer program for some mode. Such a
function can be fed into a correspond- ing --mode-viewer
option.</p>

<p>&middot; Enter --shell to specify a shell for the run of
groffer2.sh. Some shells run much faster than the standard
shell.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following configuration file
in ~/.groff/groffer.conf, say.</p>

<p># groffer configuration file # # groffer options that
are used in each call of groffer --shell=ksh
--foreground=DarkBlue --resolution=100 --x-viewer=gxditview
-geometry 900x1200 # # some shell commands if test
&quot;$DISPLAY&quot; = &quot;&quot;; then export
DISPLAY=localhost:0.0 fi date &gt;&gt;~/mygroffer.log</p>

<p>The lines starting with # are command lines. This
configuration sets four groffer options (the lines starting
with -) and runs two shell commands (the rest of the
script). This has the following effects:</p>

<p>&middot; Use ksh as the shell to run the groffer script;
if it works it should be faster than the usual sh.</p>

<p>&middot; Use a text color of DarkBlue in all viewers
that support this, such as gxditview.</p>

<p>&middot; Use a resolution of 100 dpi in all viewers that
support this, such as gxditview. By this, the default device
in x mode is set to X100.</p>

<p>&middot; Force gxditview(1) as the x-mode viewer using
the geometry option for setting the width to 900 dpi and the
height to 1200 dpi. This geome- try is suitable for a
resolution of 100 dpi.</p>

<p>&middot; If the environment variable $DISPLAY is empty
set it to local- host:0.0. That allows to start groffer in
the standard X Window dis- play, even when the program is
called from a text console.</p>

<p>&middot; Just for fun, the date of each groffer start is
written to the file mygroffer.log in the home directory.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The usage of groffer is very easy. Usually, it
is just called with a file name or man page. The following
examples, however, show that groffer has much more fancy
capabilities.</p>

<p>sh# groffer /usr/local/share/doc/groff/meintro.ms.gz
Decompress, format and display the compressed file
meintro.ms.gz in the directory /usr/local/share/doc/groff,
using the standard viewer gxditview as graphical viewer when
in X Window, or the less(1) pager program when not in X
Window.</p>

<p>sh# groffer groff If the file ./groff exists use it as
input. Otherwise interpret the argument as a search for the
man page named groff in the smallest possible man section,
being section 1 in this case.</p>

<p>sh# groffer man:groff search for the man page of groff
even when the file ./groff ex- ists.</p>

<p>sh# groffer groff.7 sh# groffer 7 groff search the man
page of groff in man section 7. This section search works
only for a digit or a single character from a small set.</p>

<p>sh# groffer fb.modes If the file ./fb.modes does not
exist interpret this as a search for the man page of
fb.modes. As the extension modes is not a single character
in classical section style the argument is not split to a
search for fb.</p>

<p>sh# groffer groff troff(1) man:roff The arguments that
are not existing files are looked-up as the following man
pages: groff (automatic search, should be found in man
section 1), troff (in section 1), and roff (in the section
with the lowest number, being 7 in this case). The quotes
around _troff(1)_ are necessary because the paranthesis are
spe- cial shell characters; escaping them with a backslash
character ( and ) would be possible, too. The formatted
files are con- catenated and displayed in one piece.</p>

<p>sh# LANG=de groffer --man --www --www-viever=galeon ls
Retrieve the German man page (language de) for the ls
program, decompress it, format it to html format (www mode)
and view the result in the web browser galeon. The option
--man guarantees that the man page is retrieved, even when a
local file ls exists in the actual directory.</p>

<p>sh# groffer --source man:roff(7) Get the man page called
roff in man section 7, decompress it, and print its
unformatted content, its source code.</p>

<p>sh# groffer --de-p --in --ap This is a set of
abbreviated arguments, it is determined as sh# groffer
--debug-params --intermediate-output --apropos</p>

<p>sh# cat file.gz | groffer -Z -mfoo The file file.gz is
sent to standard input, this is decom- pressed, and then
this is transported to the groff intermediate output mode
without post-processing (groff option -Z), using macro
package foo (groff option -m)</p>

<p>sh# echo <tt><b>WOW! | &gt; groffer --x --bg red --fg
yellow --geometry 200x100 - Display the word WOW! in a small
window in constant-width bold font, using color yellow on
red background.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>COMPATIBILITY The groffer program consists of two
shell scripts.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The starting script is the file groffer that is
installed in a bin di- rectory. It is generated from the
source file groffer.sh. It is just a short starting script
without any functions such that it can run on very poor
shells.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The main part of the groffer program is the file
groffer2.sh that is installed in the groff library
directory. This script can be run under a different shell by
using the groffer option --shell.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>Both scripts are compatible with both GNU and
POSIX. POSIX compatibil- ity refers to IEEE P1003.2/D11.2 of
September 1991, a very early ver- sion of the POSIX standard
that is still freely available in the inter- net at POSIX
P1003.2 draft 11.2 http://www.funet.fi/pub/doc/posix/
p1003.2/d11.2/all.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>Only a restricted set of shell language elements
and shell builtins is used to achieve even compatibility
with some Bourne shells that are not fully POSIX compatible.
The groffer shell scripts were tested on many shells,
including the following Bourne shells: ash(1), bash(1),
dash(1), ksh(1), pdksh(1), posh(1), and zsh(1). So it should
work on most actual free and commercial operating
systems.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The shell for the run of groffer2.sh can be
chosen by the option --shell on the command line or the
environment variable $GROFF_OPT. If you want to add it to
one of the groffer configuration files you must write a line
starting with --shell.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The groffer program provides its own parser for
command line arguments that is compatible to both POSIX
getopts(1) and GNU getopt(1). It can handle option arguments
and file names containing white space and a large set of
special characters. The following standard types of op-
tions are supported.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; The option consisiting of a single minus
- refers to standard input.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; A single minus followed by characters
refers to a single character option or a combination
thereof; for example, the groffer short op- tion combination
-Qmfoo is equivalent to -Q -m foo.</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; Long options are options with names
longer than one character; they are always preceded by a
double minus. An option argument can either go to the next
command line argument or be appended with an equal sign to
the argument; for example, --long=arg is equivalent to
--long arg .</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; An argument of -- ends option parsing;
all further command line argu- ments are interpreted as
filespec parameters, i.e. file names or con- structs for
searching man pages).</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>&middot; All command line arguments that are
neither options nor option argu- ments are interpreted as
filespec parameters and stored until option parsing has
finished. For example, the command line sh# groffer file1 -a
-o arg file2 is equivalent to sh# groffer -a -o arg -- file1
file2</b></tt></p>

<p><tt><b>The free mixing of options and filespec
parameters follows the GNU principle. That does not fulfill
the strange option behavior of POSIX that ends option
processing as soon as the first non-option argument has been
reached. The end of option processing can be forced by the
option -- anyway.</b></tt></p>
