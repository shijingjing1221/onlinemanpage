<p>DOVEADM-PURGE(1) Dovecot DOVEADM-PURGE(1)</p>

<p>NAME doveadm-purge - Remove messages with refcount=0
from mdbox files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS doveadm [-Dv] purge [-S socket_path] doveadm
[-Dv] purge [-S socket_path] -A doveadm [-Dv] purge [-S
socket_path] -u user</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The doveadm purge command is used to remove
all messages with ref- count=0 from a user&rsquo;s mail
storage. The refcount of a message is decreased to 0 when
the user (or some administration utility) has expunged all
instances of a message from all mailboxes.</p>

<p>In the first form, doveadm(1) will perform the purge
action for the currently logged in user.</p>

<p>In the second form, the command will be executed for all
users</p>

<p>In the last form, only messages of the given user(s)
will be purged.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Global doveadm(1) options:</p>

<p>-D Enables verbosity and debug messages.</p>

<p>-v Enables verbosity, including progress counter.</p>

<p>Command specific options:</p>

<p>-A If the -A option is present, the command will be
performed for all users. Using this option in combination
with system users from userdb { driver = passwd } is not
recommended, because it contains also users with a lower UID
than the one configured with the first_valid_uid
setting.</p>

<p>When the SQL userdb module is used make sure that the
iter- ate_query setting in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext
matches your database layout. When using the LDAP userdb
module, make sure that the iterate_attrs and iterate_filter
settings in /etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your
LDAP schema. Oth- erwise doveadm(1) will be unable to
iterate over all users.</p>

<p>-S socket_path The option&rsquo;s argument is either an
absolute path to a local UNIX domain socket, or a hostname
and port (hostname:port), in order to connect a remote host
via a TCP socket.</p>

<p>This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail
commands through the given socket.</p>

<p>-u user/mask Run the command only for the given user.
It&rsquo;s also possible to use &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org). When
neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the com-
mand will be executed with the environment of the currently
logged in user.</p>
