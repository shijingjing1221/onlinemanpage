<p>KSSHASKPASS(1) KSSHASKPASS(1)</p>

<p>NAME ksshaskpass - prompts a user for a passphrase using
KDE</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kdesshaskpass</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kshaskpass is a KDE-based passphrase dialog
for use with OpenSSH. It is intended to be called by the
ssh-add(1) program and not invoked directly. It allows
ssh-add(1) to obtain a passphrase from a user, even if not
connected to a terminal (assuming that an X display is
available). This happens automatically in the case where
ssh-add is invoked from one s ~/.xsession or as one of the
KDE startup programs, for example.</p>

<p>In order to be called automatically by ssh-add,
ksshaskpass should be installed as /usr/bin/ssh-askpass.</p>

<p>AUTHOR This manual page was written by Armin Berres
&lt;trigger@space-based.de&gt;. It was based on that for
gnome-ssh-askpass by Colin Watson &lt;cjwat-
son@debian.org&gt;.</p>
