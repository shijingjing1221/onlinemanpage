<p>NAME ttytype - terminal device to default terminal type
mapping</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The /etc/ttytype file associates
termcap/terminfo terminal type names with tty lines. Each
line consists of a terminal type, followed by whitespace,
followed by a tty name (a device name without the /dev/)
prefix.</p>

<p>This association is used by the program tset(1) to set
the environment variable TERM to the default terminal name
for the users current tty.</p>

<p>This facility was designed for a traditional
time-sharing environment featuring character-cell terminals
hardwired to a Unix minicomputer. It is little used on
modern workstation and personal Unixes.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ttytype the tty definitions file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A typical /etc/ttytype is:</p>

<p>con80x25 tty1 vt320 ttys0</p>

<p>SEE ALSO termcap(5), terminfo(5), agetty(8),
mingetty(8)</p>
