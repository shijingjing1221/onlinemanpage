<p>radiusd.conf(5) FreeRADIUS configuration file
radiusd.conf(5)</p>

<p>NAME radiusd.conf - configuration file for the
FreeRADIUS server</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The radiusd.conf file resides in the radius
database directory, by default /etc/raddb. It defines the
global configuration for the FreeRADIUS RADIUS server.</p>

<p>CONTENTS There are a large number of configuration
parameters for the server. Most are documented in the file
itself as comments. This page docu- ments only the format of
the file. Please read the radiusd.conf file itself for more
information.</p>

<p>The configuration file parser is independent of the
server configura- tion. This means that you can put almost
anything into the configura- tion file. So long as it is
properly formatted, the server will start.</p>

<p>When the server parses the configuration file, it looks
only for those configurations it understands. Extra
configuration items are ignored. This &quot;feature&quot;
can be (ab)used in certain interesting ways.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT The file format is line-based, like many
other Unix configuration files. Each entry in the file must
be placed on a line by itself, although continuations are
supported.</p>

<p>The file consists of configuration items (variable =
value pairs), sec- tions, and comments.</p>

<p>Variables Variables can be set via:</p>

<p>name = value</p>

<p>Single and double-quoted strings are permitted:</p>

<p>string1 = &quot;hello world&quot; string2 = hello
mom</p>

<p>Sections A section begins with a section name, followed
on the same line by an open bracket { . Section may contain
other sections, comments, or variables. Sections may be
nested to any depth, limited only by available memory. A
section ends with a close bracket &acute;}, on a line by
itself.</p>

<p>section { ... }</p>

<p>Sections can sometimes have a second name following the
first one. The situations where this is legal depend on the
context. See the examples and comments in the radiusd.conf
file for more information.</p>

<p>section foo { ... }</p>

<p>Comments Any line beginning with a (#) is deemed to be a
comment, and is ignored. Comments can appear after a
variable or section defi- nitions.</p>

<p># comment foo = bar # set variable foo to value bar
section { # start of section ... } # end of section</p>

<p>Continuations Long lines can be broken up via
continuations, using as the last character of the line. For
example, the following entry:</p>

<p>foo = &quot;blah blah blah&quot;</p>

<p>will set the value of the variable &quot;foo&quot; to
&quot;blah blah blah&quot;. Any CR or LF is not turned into
a space, but all other whitespace is preserved in the final
value.</p>

<p>REFERENCES The value of a variable can reference another
variable. These refer- ences are evaluated when the
configuration file is loaded, which means that there is no
run-time cost associated with them. This feature is most
useful for turning long, repeated pieces of text into short
ones.</p>

<p>Variables are referenced by ${variable_name}, as in the
following exam- ples.</p>

<p>foo = bar # set variable foo to value bar who = ${foo} #
sets variable who to value of variable foo my = &quot;${foo}
a&quot; # sets variable my to &quot;bar a&quot;</p>

<p>If the variable exists in a section or subsection, it
can be referenced as ${section.subsection.variable}. Forward
references are not allowed. Relative references are allowed,
by pre-pending the name with one or more period.</p>

<p>blogs = ${.foo}</p>

<p>Will set variable blogs to the value of variable foo,
from the current section.</p>

<p>blogs = ${..foo}</p>

<p>Will set variable blogs to the value of variable foo,
from the section which contains the current section.</p>

<p>blogs = ${modules.detail.detailfile}</p>

<p>Will set variable blogs to the value of variable
detailfile, of the detail module, which is in the modules
section of the configuration file.</p>
