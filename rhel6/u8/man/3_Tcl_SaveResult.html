Tcl_SaveResult(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_SaveInterpState, Tcl_RestoreInterpState,
Tcl_DiscardInterpState, Tcl_SaveResult, Tcl_RestoreResult,
Tcl_DiscardResult - save and restore an interpreters
state</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_InterpState Tcl_SaveInterpState(interp, status)</p>

<p>int Tcl_RestoreInterpState(interp, state)</p>

<p>Tcl_DiscardInterpState(state)</p>

<p>Tcl_SaveResult(interp, savedPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_RestoreResult(interp, savedPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_DiscardResult(savedPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter for which
state should be saved.</p>

<p>int status (in) Return code value to save as part of
interpreter state.</p>

<p>Tcl_InterpState state (in) Saved state token to be
restored or discarded.</p>

<p>Tcl_SavedResult *savedPtr (in) Pointer to location where
inter- preter result should be saved or restored.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These routines allows a C procedure to take
a snapshot of the current state of an interpreter so that it
can be restored after a call to Tcl_Eval or some other
routine that modifies the interpreter state. There are two
triplets of routines meant to work together.</p>

<p>The first triplet stores the snapshot of interpreter
state in an opaque token returned by Tcl_SaveInterpState.
That token value may then be passed back to one of
Tcl_RestoreInterpState or Tcl_DiscardInterpState, depending
on whether the interp state is to be restored. So long as
one of the latter two routines is called, Tcl will take care
of memory management.</p>

<p>The second triplet stores the snapshot of only the
interpreter result (not its complete state) in memory
allocated by the caller. These rou- tines are passed a
pointer to a Tcl_SavedResult structure that is used to store
enough information to restore the interpreter result. This
structure can be allocated on the stack of the calling
procedure. These routines do not save the state of any error
information in the interpreter (e.g. the -errorcode or
-errorinfo return options, when an error is in
progress).</p>

<p>Because the routines Tcl_SaveInterpState,
Tcl_RestoreInterpState, and Tcl_DiscardInterpState perform a
superset of the functions provided by the other routines,
any new code should only make use of the more pow- erful
routines. The older, weaker routines Tcl_SaveResult,
Tcl_Restor- eResult, and Tcl_DiscardResult continue to exist
only for the sake of existing programs that may already be
using them.</p>

<p>Tcl_SaveInterpState takes a snapshot of those portions
of interpreter state that make up the full result of script
evaluation. This include the interpreter result, the return
code (passed in as the status argu- ment, and any return
options, including -errorinfo and -errorcode when an error
is in progress. This snapshot is returned as an opaque token
of type Tcl_InterpState. The call to Tcl_SaveInterpState
does not itself change the state of the interpreter. Unlike
Tcl_SaveResult, it does not reset the interpreter.</p>

<p>Tcl_RestoreInterpState accepts a Tcl_InterpState token
previously returned by Tcl_SaveInterpState and restores the
state of the interp to the state held in that snapshot. The
return value of Tcl_RestoreIn- terpState is the status value
originally passed to Tcl_SaveInterpState when the snapshot
token was created.</p>

<p>Tcl_DiscardInterpState is called to release a
Tcl_InterpState token previously returned by
Tcl_SaveInterpState when that snapshot is not to be restored
to an interp.</p>

<p>The Tcl_InterpState token returned by
Tcl_SaveInterpState must eventu- ally be passed to either
Tcl_RestoreInterpState or Tcl_DiscardInterp- State to avoid
a memory leak. Once the Tcl_InterpState token is passed to
one of them, the token is no longer valid and should not be
used anymore.</p>

<p>Tcl_SaveResult moves the string and object results of
interp into the location specified by statePtr.
Tcl_SaveResult clears the result for interp and leaves the
result in its normal empty initialized state.</p>

<p>Tcl_RestoreResult moves the string and object results
from statePtr back into interp. Any result or error that was
already in the inter- preter will be cleared. The statePtr
is left in an uninitialized state and cannot be used until
another call to Tcl_SaveResult.</p>

<p>Tcl_DiscardResult releases the saved interpreter state
stored at statePtr. The state structure is left in an
uninitialized state and cannot be used until another call to
Tcl_SaveResult.</p>

<p>Once Tcl_SaveResult is called to save the interpreter
result, either Tcl_RestoreResult or Tcl_DiscardResult must
be called to properly clean up the memory associated with
the saved state.</p>
