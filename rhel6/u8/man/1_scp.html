<p>SCP(1) BSD General Commands Manual SCP(1)</p>

<p>NAME scp - secure copy (remote file copy program)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scp [-1246BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config]
[-i identity_file] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S
program] [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION scp copies files between hosts on a network.
It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same
authentication and provides the same security as ssh(1).
Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if
they are needed for authentication.</p>

<p>File names may contain a user and host specification to
indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host.
Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or
relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names
containing : as host specifiers. Copies between two remote
hosts are also permitted.</p>

<p>When copying a source file to a target file which
already exists, scp will replace the contents of the target
file (keeping the inode).</p>

<p>If the target file does not yet exist, an empty file
with the target file name is created, then filled with the
source file contents. No attempt is made at
&quot;near-atomic&quot; transfer using temporary files.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-1 Forces scp to use protocol 1.</p>

<p>-2 Forces scp to use protocol 2.</p>

<p>-4 Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.</p>

<p>-6 Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.</p>

<p>-B Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
passphrases).</p>

<p>-C Compression enable. Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to
enable com- pression.</p>

<p>-c cipher Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the
data transfer. This option is directly passed to ssh(1).</p>

<p>-F ssh_config Specifies an alternative per-user
configuration file for ssh. This option is directly passed
to ssh(1).</p>

<p>-i identity_file Selects the file from which the
identity (private key) for public key authentication is
read. This option is directly passed to ssh(1).</p>

<p>-l limit Limits the used bandwidth, specified in
Kbit/s.</p>

<p>-o ssh_option Can be used to pass options to ssh in the
format used in ssh_config(5). This is useful for specifying
options for which there is no separate scp command-line
flag. For full details of the options listed below, and
their possible values, see ssh_config(5).</p>

<p>-P port Specifies the port to connect to on the remote
host. Note that this option is written with a capital P,
because -p is already reserved for preserving the times and
modes of the file in rcp(1).</p>

<p>-p Preserves modification times, access times, and modes
from the original file.</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as
warning and diagnostic messages from ssh(1).</p>

<p>-r Recursively copy entire directories. Note that scp
follows sym- bolic links encountered in the tree
traversal.</p>

<p>-S program Name of program to use for the encrypted
connection. The program must understand ssh(1) options.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Causes scp and ssh(1) to print
debugging messages about their progress. This is helpful in
debugging connection, authentication, and configuration
problems.</p>

<p>The scp utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an
error occurs.</p>

<p>IPV6 IPv6 address can be used everywhere where IPv4
address. In all entries must be the IPv6 address enclosed in
square brackets. Note: The square brackets are
metacharacters for the shell and must be escaped in
shell.</p>

ssh-agent(1), ssh-keygen(1), ssh_config(5), sshd(8)</p>

<p>HISTORY scp is based on the rcp(1) program in BSD source
code from the Regents of the University of California.</p>
