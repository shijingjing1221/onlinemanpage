<p>CONSOLE(4) Linux Programmer s Manual CONSOLE(4)</p>

<p>NAME console - console terminal and virtual consoles</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A Linux system has up to 63 virtual consoles
(character devices with major number 4 and minor number 1 to
63), usually called /dev/ttyn with 1 n 63. The current
console is also addressed by /dev/console or /dev/tty0, the
character device with major number 4 and minor number 0. The
device files /dev/* are usually created using the script
MAKEDEV, or using mknod(1), usually with mode 0622 and owner
root.tty.</p>

<p>Before kernel version 1.1.54 the number of virtual
consoles was com- piled into the kernel (in tty.h: #define
NR_CONSOLES 8) and could be changed by editing and
recompiling. Since version 1.1.54 virtual con- soles are
created on the fly, as soon as they are needed.</p>

<p>Common ways to start a process on a console are: (a)
tell init(8) (in inittab(5)) to start a mingetty(8) (or
agetty(8)) on the console; (b) ask openvt(1) to start a
process on the console; (c) start X it will find the first
unused console, and display its output there. (There is also
the ancient doshell(8).)</p>

<p>Common ways to switch consoles are: (a) use Alt+Fn or
Ctrl+Alt+Fn to switch to console n; AltGr+Fn might bring you
to console n+12 [here Alt and AltGr refer to the left and
right Alt keys, respectively]; (b) use Alt+RightArrow or
Alt+LeftArrow to cycle through the presently allo- cated
consoles; (c) use the program chvt(1). (The key mapping is
user settable, see loadkeys(1); the above mentioned key
combinations are according to the default settings.)</p>

<p>The command deallocvt(1) (formerly disalloc) will free
the memory taken by the screen buffers for consoles that no
longer have any associated process.</p>

<p>Properties Consoles carry a lot of state. I hope to
document that some other time. The most important fact is
that the consoles simulate vt100 ter- minals. In particular,
a console is reset to the initial state by printing the two
characters ESC c. All escape sequences can be found in
console_codes(4).</p>
