<p>PAM(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM(8)</p>

<p>NAME PAM, pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules for
Linux</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual is intended to offer a quick
introduction to Linux-PAM. For more information the reader
is directed to the Linux-PAM system administrators&acute;
guide.</p>

<p>Linux-PAM is a system of libraries that handle the
authentication tasks of applications (services) on the
system. The library provides a stable general interface
(Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege
granting programs (such as login(1) and su(1)) defer to to
perform standard authentication tasks.</p>

<p>The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the
nature of the authentication is dynamically configurable. In
other words, the system administrator is free to choose how
individual service-providing applications will authenticate
users. This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of
the single Linux-PAM configuration file /etc/pam.conf.
Alternatively, the configuration can be set by individual
configuration files located in the /etc/pam.d/ directory.
The presence of this directory will cause Linux-PAM to
ignore /etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the system administrator, for
whom this manual is provided, it is not of primary
importance to understand the internal behavior of the
Linux-PAM library. The important point to recognize is that
the configuration file(s) define the connection between
applications (services) and the pluggable authentication
modules (PAMs) that perform the actual authentication
tasks.</p>

<p>Linux-PAM separates the tasks of authentication into
four independent management groups: account management;
authentication management; password management; and session
management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these
groups in the configuration file.)</p>

<p>Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects
of a typical user&acute;s request for a restricted
service:</p>

<p>account - provide account verification types of service:
has the user&acute;s password expired?; is this user
permitted access to the requested service?</p>

<p>authentication - authenticate a user and set up user
credentials. Typically this is via some challenge-response
request that the user must satisfy: if you are who you claim
to be please enter your password. Not all authentications
are of this type, there exist hardware based authentication
schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric
devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted
seamlessly for more standard approaches to authentication -
such is the flexibility of Linux-PAM.</p>

<p>password - this group&acute;s responsibility is the task
of updating authentication mechanisms. Typically, such
services are strongly coupled to those of the auth group.
Some authentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being
updated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based
access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement
password.</p>

<p>session - this group of tasks cover things that should
be done prior to a service being given and after it is
withdrawn. Such tasks include the maintenance of audit
trails and the mounting of the user&acute;s home directory.
The session management group is important as it provides
both an opening and closing hook for modules to affect the
services available to a user.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/pam.conf the configuration file</p>

<p>/etc/pam.d the Linux-PAM configuration directory.
Generally, if this directory is present, the /etc/pam.conf
file is ignored.</p>

<p>ERRORS Typically errors generated by the Linux-PAM
system of libraries, will be written to syslog(3).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO DCE-RFC 86.0, October 1995. Contains
additional features, but remains backwardly compatible with
this RFC.</p>
