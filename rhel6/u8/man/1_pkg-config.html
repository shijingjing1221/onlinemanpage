<p>NAME pkg-config - Return metainformation about installed
libraries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pkg-config [--modversion] [--help]
[--print-errors] [--silence-errors] [--cflags] [--libs]
[--libs-only-L] [--libs-only-l] [--cflags-only-I]
[--variable=VARIABLENAME]
[--define-variable=VARIABLENAME=VARIABLE- VALUE]
[--uninstalled] [--exists] [--atleast-version=VERSION]
[--exact- version=VERSION] [--max-version=VERSION]
[LIBRARIES...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pkg-config program is used to retrieve
information about installed libraries in the system. It is
typically used to compile and link against one or more
libraries. Here is a typical usage scenario in a
Makefile:</p>

<p>program: program.c cc program.c pkg-config --cflags
--libs gnomeui</p>

<p>pkg-config retrieves information about packages from
special metadata files. These files are named after the
package, with the extension .pc. By default, pkg-config
looks in the directory prefix/lib/pkgconfig for these files;
it will also look in the colon-separated (on Windows,
semicolon-separated) list of directories specified by the
PKG_CON- FIG_PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>The package name specified on the pkg-config command
line is defined to be the name of the metadata file, minus
the .pc extension. If a library can install multiple
versions simultaneously, it must give each version its own
name (for example, GTK 1.2 might have the package name
&quot;gtk+&quot; while GTK 2.0 has
&quot;gtk+-2.0&quot;).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>--modversion Requests that the version information of
the libraries specified on the command line be displayed. If
pkg-config can find all the libraries on the command line,
each librarys version string is printed to stdout, one
version per line. In this case pkg- config exits
successfully. If one or more libraries is unknown,
pkg-config exits with a nonzero code, and the contents of
stdout are undefined.</p>

<p>--help Displays a help message and terminates.</p>

<p>--print-errors If one or more of the modules on the
command line, or their dependencies, are not found, or if an
error occurs in parsing a .pc file, then this option will
cause errors explaining the problem to be printed. With
&quot;predicate&quot; options such as &quot;--exists&quot;
pkg-config runs silently by default, because its usually
used in scripts that want to control what s output. This
option can be used alone (to just print errors encountered
locating modules on the command line) or with other options.
The PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW environment variable overrides
this option.</p>

<p>--silence-errors If one or more of the modules on the
command line, or their dependencies, are not found, or if an
error occurs in parsing a a .pc file, then this option will
keep errors explaining the problem from being printed. With
&quot;predicate&quot; options such as &quot;--exists&quot;
pkg-config runs silently by default, because its usually
used in scripts that want to control what s output. So this
option is only useful with options such as
&quot;--cflags&quot; or &quot;--modversion&quot; that print
errors by default. The PKG_CON- FIG_DEBUG_SPEW environment
variable overrides this option.</p>

<p>--errors-to-stdout If printing errors, print them to
stdout rather than the default stderr</p>

<p>The following options are used to compile and link
programs:</p>

<p>--cflags This prints pre-processor and compile flags
required to compile the packages on the command line,
including flags for all their dependencies. Flags are
&quot;compressed&quot; so that each identical flag appears
only once. pkg-config exits with a nonzero code if it cant
find metadata for one or more of the packages on the com-
mand line.</p>

<p>--libs This option is identical to &quot;--cflags&quot;,
only it prints the link flags. As with &quot;--cflags&quot;,
duplicate flags are merged (maintain- ing proper ordering),
and flags for dependencies are included in the output.</p>

<p>--libs-only-L This prints the -L/-R part of
&quot;--libs&quot;. That is, it defines the library search
path but doesn t specify which libraries to link with.</p>

<p>--libs-only-l This prints the -l part of
&quot;--libs&quot; for the libraries specified on the
command line. Note that the union of
&quot;--libs-only-l&quot; and &quot;--libs-only-L&quot; may
be smaller than &quot;--libs&quot;, due to flags such as
-rdynamic.</p>

<p>--variable=VARIABLENAME This returns the value of a
variable defined in a packages .pc file. Most packages
define the variable &quot;prefix&quot;, for example, so you
can say: $ pkg-config --variable=prefix glib-2.0 /usr/</p>

<p>--define-variable=VARIABLENAME=VARIABLEVALUE This sets a
global value for a variable, overriding the value in any .pc
files. Most packages define the variable &quot;prefix&quot;,
for example, so you can say: $ pkg-config --print-errors
--define-variable=prefix=/foo --variable=prefix glib-2.0
/foo</p>

<p>--uninstalled Normally if you request the package
&quot;foo&quot; and the package &quot;foo- uninstalled&quot;
exists, pkg-config will prefer the &quot;-uninstalled&quot;
variant. This allows compilation/linking against uninstalled
packages. If you specify the &quot;--uninstalled&quot;
option, pkg-config will return successfully if any
&quot;-uninstalled&quot; packages are being used, and return
failure (false) otherwise. (The
&quot;PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED&quot; environment
variable keeps pkg- config from implicitly choosing
&quot;-uninstalled&quot; packages, so if that variable is
set, they will only have been used if you pass a name like
&quot;foo-uninstalled&quot; on the command line
explicitly.)</p>

<p>--exists</p>

<p>--atleast-version=VERSION</p>

<p>--exact-version=VERSION</p>

<p>--max-version=VERSION These options test whether the
package or list of packages on the command line are known to
pkg-config, and optionally whether the version number of a
package meets certain contraints. If all packages exist and
meet the specified version constraints, pkg-config exits
successfully. Otherwise it exits unsuccess- fully.</p>

<p>Rather than using the version-test options, you can
simply give a version constraint after each package name,
for example: $ pkg-config --exists glib-2.0 &gt;= 1.3.4
libxml = 1.8.3 Remember to use --print-errors if you want
error messages.</p>

<p>--msvc-syntax This option is available only on Windows.
It causes pkg-config to output -l and -L flags in the form
recognized by the Microsoft Visual C++ command-line
compiler, cl. Specifically, instead of -Lx:/some/path it
prints /libpath:x/some/path, and instead of -lfoo it prints
foo.lib. Note that the --libs output consists of flags for
the linker, and should be placed on the cl command line
after a /link switch.</p>

<p>--dont-define-prefix This option is available only on
Windows. It prevents pkg-config from automatically trying to
override the value of the variable &quot;prefix&quot; in
each .pc file.</p>

<p>--prefix-variable=PREFIX Also this option is available
only on Windows. It sets the name of the variable that
pkg-config automatically sets as described above.</p>

<p>--static Output libraries suitable for static linking.
That means including any private libraries in the output.
This relies on proper tagging in the .pc files, else a too
large number of libraries will ordinarily be output.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PKG_CONFIG_PATH A colon-separated
(on Windows, semicolon-separated) list of directories to
search for .pc files. The default directory will always be
searched after searching the path; the default is lib-
dir/pkgconfig:datadir/pkgconfig where libdir is the libdir
where pkg-config and datadir is the datadir where pkg-config
was installed.</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW If set, causes pkg-config to print
all kinds of debugging infor- mation and report all
errors.</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR A value to set for the magic
variable pc_top_builddir which may appear in .pc files. If
the environment variable is not set, the default value
$(top_builddir) will be used. This variable should refer to
the top builddir of the Makefile where the com- pile/link
flags reported by pkg-config will be used. This only matters
when compiling/linking against a package that hasnt yet been
installed.</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED Normally if you request
the package &quot;foo&quot; and the package &quot;foo-
uninstalled&quot; exists, pkg-config will prefer the
&quot;-uninstalled&quot; variant. This allows
compilation/linking against uninstalled packages. If this
environment variable is set, it disables said behavior.</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS Dont strip -I/usr/include
out of cflags.</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS Dont strip -L/usr/lib out
of libs</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR Modify -I and -L to use the
directories located in target sys- root. this option is
usefull when crosscompiling package that use pkg-config to
determine CFLAGS anf LDFLAGS. -I and -L are modified to
point to the new system root. this means that a
-I/usr/include/libfoo will become
-I/var/target/usr/include/lib- foo with a
PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR equal to /var/target (same rule apply
to -L)</p>

<p>PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR Replaces the default pkg-config search
directory.</p>

<p>WINDOWS SPECIALITIES If a .pc file is found in a
directory that matches the usual conven- tions (i.e., ends
with kgconfig), the prefix for that package is assumed to be
the grandparent of the directory where the file was found,
and the prefix variable is overridden for that file
accordingly.</p>

<p>In addition to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable,
the Registry keys
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwarepkgconfigPKG_CONFIG_PATH and
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwarepkgconfigPKG_CONFIG_PATH can be
used to specify directories to search for .pc files. Each
(string) value in these keys is treated as a directory where
to look for .pc files.</p>

<p>AUTOCONF MACROS
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(VARIABLE-PREFIX,MODULES[,ACTION-IF-FOUND,[ACTION-IF-
NOT-FOUND]])</p>

<p>The macro PKG_CHECK_MODULES can be used in configure.ac
to check whether modules exist. A typical usage would be:
PKG_CHECK_MODULES([MYSTUFF], [gtk+-2.0 &gt;= 1.3.5 libxml =
1.8.4])</p>

<p>This would result in MYSTUFF_LIBS and MYSTUFF_CFLAGS
substitu- tion variables, set to the libs and cflags for the
given module list. If a module is missing or has the wrong
version, by default configure will abort with a message. To
replace the default action, specify an ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND.
PKG_CHECK_MOD- ULES will not print any error messages if you
specify your own ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND. However, it will set
the variable MYSTUFF_PKG_ERRORS, which you can use to
display what went wrong.</p>

<p>Note that if there is a possibility the first call to
PKG_CHECK_MODULES might not happen, you should be sure to
include an explicit call to PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG in your
config- ure.ac</p>

<p>PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG([MIN-VERSION])</p>

<p>Defines the PKG_CONFIG variable to the best pkg-config
avail- able, useful if you need pkg-config but dont want to
use PKG_CHECK_MODULES.</p>

<p>PKG_CHECK_EXISTS(MODULES, [ACTION-IF-FOUND],
[ACTION-IF-NOT- FOUND])</p>

<p>Check to see whether a particular set of modules exists.
Simi- lar to PKG_CHECK_MODULES(), but does not set variables
or print errors.</p>

<p>Similar to PKG_CHECK_MODULES, make sure that the first
instance of this or PKG_CHECK_MODULES is called, or make
sure to call PKG_CHECK_EXISTS manually</p>

<p>METADATA FILE SYNTAX To add a library to the set of
packages pkg-config knows about, simply install a .pc file.
You should install this file to libdir/pkgconfig.</p>

<p>Here is an example file: # This is a comment
prefix=/home/hp/unst # this defines a variable
exec_prefix=${prefix} # defining another variable in terms
of the first libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include</p>

<p>Name: GObject # human-readable name Description:
Object/type system for GLib # human-readable description
Version: 1.3.1 URL: http://www.gtk.org Requires: glib-2.0 =
1.3.1 Conflicts: foobar &lt;= 4.5 Libs: -L${libdir}
-lgobject-1.3 Libs.private: -lm Cflags:
-I${includedir}/glib-2.0 -I${libdir}/glib/include</p>

<p>You would normally generate the file using configure, of
course, so that the prefix, etc. are set to the proper
values.</p>

<p>Files have two kinds of line: keyword lines start with a
keyword plus a colon, and variable definitions start with an
alphanumeric string plus an equals sign. Keywords are
defined in advance and have special mean- ing to pkg-config;
variables do not, you can have any variables that you wish
(however, users may expect to retrieve the usual directory
name variables).</p>

<p>Note that variable references are written
&quot;${foo}&quot;; you can escape lit- eral &quot;${&quot;
as &quot;$${&quot;.</p>

<p>Name: This field should be a human-readable name for the
package. Note that it is not the name passed as an argument
to pkg-config.</p>

<p>Description: This should be a brief description of the
package</p>

<p>URL: An URL where people can get more information about
and download the package</p>

<p>Version: This should be the most-specific-possible
package version string.</p>

<p>Requires: This is a comma-separated list of packages
that are required by your package. Flags from dependent
packages will be merged in to the flags reported for your
package. Optionally, you can specify the version of the
required package (using the operators =, &lt;, &gt;, &gt;=,
&lt;=); specifying a version allows pkg-config to perform
extra sanity checks. You may only mention the same package
one time on the Requires: line. If the version of a package
is unspecified, any version will be used with no
checking.</p>

<p>Conflicts: This optional line allows pkg-config to
perform additional san- ity checks, primarily to detect
broken user installations. The syntax is the same as
Requires: except that you can list the same package more
than once here, for example &quot;foobar = 1.2.3, foobar =
1.2.5, foobar &gt;= 1.3&quot;, if you have reason to do so.
If a version isn t specified, then your package conflicts
with all versions of the mentioned package. If a user tries
to use your package and a conflicting package at the same
time, then pkg- config will complain.</p>

<p>Libs: This line should give the link flags specific to
your package. Don t add any flags for required packages;
pkg-config will add those automatically.</p>

<p>Libs.private: This line should list any private
libraries in use. Private libraries are libraries which are
not exposed through your library, but are needed in the case
of static linking.</p>

<p>Cflags: This line should list the compile flags specific
to your pack- age. Dont add any flags for required packages;
pkg-config will add those automatically.</p>

<p>AUTHOR pkg-config was written by James Henstridge,
rewritten by Martijn van Beers, and rewritten again by Havoc
Pennington. Tim Janik, Owen Taylor, and Raja Harinath
submitted suggestions and some code. gnome-config was
written by Miguel de Icaza, Raja Harinath and various
hackers in the GNOME team. It was inspired by Owen Taylor s
gtk-config program.</p>

<p>BUGS pkg-config does not handle mixing of parameters
with and without = well. Stick with one.</p>
