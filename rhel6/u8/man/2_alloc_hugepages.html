<p>ALLOC_HUGEPAGES(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
ALLOC_HUGEPAGES(2)</p>

<p>NAME alloc_hugepages, free_hugepages - allocate or free
huge pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void *alloc_hugepages(int key, void *addr,
size_t len, int prot, int flag);</p>

<p>int free_hugepages(void *addr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The system calls alloc_hugepages() and
free_hugepages() were introduced in Linux 2.5.36 and removed
again in 2.5.54. They existed only on i386 and ia64 (when
built with CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE). In Linux 2.4.20 the syscall
numbers exist, but the calls fail with the error ENOSYS.</p>

<p>On i386 the memory management hardware knows about
ordinary pages (4 KiB) and huge pages (2 or 4 MiB).
Similarly ia64 knows about huge pages of several sizes.
These system calls serve to map huge pages into the processs
memory or to free them again. Huge pages are locked into
memory, and are not swapped.</p>

<p>The key argument is an identifier. When zero the pages
are private, and not inherited by children. When positive
the pages are shared with other applications using the same
key, and inherited by child pro- cesses.</p>

<p>The addr argument of free_hugepages() tells which page
is being freed: it was the return value of a call to
alloc_hugepages(). (The memory is first actually freed when
all users have released it.) The addr argu- ment of
alloc_hugepages() is a hint, that the kernel may or may not
follow. Addresses must be properly aligned.</p>

<p>The len argument is the length of the required segment.
It must be a multiple of the huge page size.</p>

<p>The prot argument specifies the memory protection of the
segment. It is one of PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, PROT_EXEC.</p>

<p>The flag argument is ignored, unless key is positive. In
that case, if flag is IPC_CREAT, then a new huge page
segment is created when none with the given key existed. If
this flag is not set, then ENOENT is returned when no
segment with the given key exists.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, alloc_hugepages() returns the
allocated virtual address, and free_hugepages() returns
zero. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS ENOSYS The system call is not supported on this
kernel.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages Number of configured
hugetlb pages. This can be read and written.</p>

<p>/proc/meminfo Gives info on the number of configured
hugetlb pages and on their size in the three variables
HugePages_Total, HugePages_Free, Hugepagesize.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These calls are specific to Linux on Intel
processors, and should not be used in programs intended to
be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES These system calls are gone; they existed only in
Linux 2.5.36 through to 2.5.54. Now the hugetlbfs file
system can be used instead. Memory backed by huge pages (if
the CPU supports them) is obtained by using mmap(2) to map
files in this virtual file system.</p>

<p>The maximal number of huge pages can be specified using
the hugepages= boot parameter.</p>

<p>COLOPHON This page is part of release 3.22 of the Linux
man-pages project. A description of the project, and
information about reporting bugs, can be found at
