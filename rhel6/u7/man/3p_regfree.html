<p>REGCOMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual REGCOMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be

<p>NAME regcomp, regerror, regexec, regfree - regular
expression matching</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;regex.h&gt;</p>

<p>int regcomp(regex_t *restrict preg, const char *restrict
pattern, int cflags); size_t regerror(int errcode, const
regex_t *restrict preg, char *restrict errbuf, size_t
errbuf_size); int regexec(const regex_t *restrict preg,
const char *restrict string, size_t nmatch, regmatch_t
pmatch[restrict], int eflags); void regfree(regex_t
*preg);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions interpret basic and extended
regular expressions as described in the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chap- ter 9, Regular
Expressions.</p>

<p>The regex_t structure is defined in &lt;regex.h&gt; and
contains at least the following member:</p>

<p>Member Type Member Name Description size_t re_nsub
Number of parenthesized subexpressions.</p>

<p>The regmatch_t structure is defined in &lt;regex.h&gt;
and contains at least the following members:</p>

<p>Member Type Member Name Description regoff_t rm_so Byte
offset from start of string to start of substring. regoff_t
rm_eo Byte offset from start of string of the first
character after the end of sub- string.</p>

<p>The regcomp() function shall compile the regular
expression contained in the string pointed to by the pattern
argument and place the results in the structure pointed to
by preg. The cflags argument is the bit- wise-inclusive OR
of zero or more of the following flags, which are defined in
the &lt;regex.h&gt; header:</p>

<p>REG_EXTENDED Use Extended Regular Expressions.</p>

<p>REG_ICASE Ignore case in match. (See the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 9,
Regular Expressions.)</p>

<p>REG_NOSUB Report only success/fail in regexec().</p>

<p>REG_NEWLINE Change the handling of &lt;newline&gt;s, as
described in the text.</p>

<p>The default regular expression type for pattern is a
Basic Regular Expression. The application can specify
Extended Regular Expressions using the REG_EXTENDED cflags
flag.</p>

<p>If the REG_NOSUB flag was not set in cflags, then
regcomp() shall set re_nsub to the number of parenthesized
subexpressions (delimited by )&quot; in basic regular
expressions or &quot;()&quot; in extended regular expres-
sions) found in pattern.</p>

<p>The regexec() function compares the null-terminated
string specified by string with the compiled regular
expression preg initialized by a pre- vious call to
regcomp(). If it finds a match, regexec() shall return 0;
otherwise, it shall return non-zero indicating either no
match or an error. The eflags argument is the
bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following flags,
which are defined in the &lt;regex.h&gt; header:</p>

<p>REG_NOTBOL The first character of the string pointed to
by string is not the beginning of the line. Therefore, the
circumflex character ( ^), when taken as a special
character, shall not match the beginning of string.</p>

<p>REG_NOTEOL The last character of the string pointed to
by string is not the end of the line. Therefore, the dollar
sign ( $ ), when taken as a special character, shall not
match the end of string.</p>

<p>If nmatch is 0 or REG_NOSUB was set in the cflags
argument to reg- comp(), then regexec() shall ignore the
pmatch argument. Otherwise, the application shall ensure
that the pmatch argument points to an array with at least
nmatch elements, and regexec() shall fill in the elements of
that array with offsets of the substrings of string that
correspond to the parenthesized subexpressions of pattern:
pmatch[ i]. rm_so shall be the byte offset of the beginning
and pmatch[ i]. rm_eo shall be one greater than the byte
offset of the end of substring i. (Subexpression i begins at
the ith matched open parenthesis, counting from 1.) Offsets
in pmatch[0] identify the substring that corresponds to the
entire reg- ular expression. Unused elements of pmatch up to
pmatch[ nmatch-1] shall be filled with -1. If there are more
than nmatch subexpressions in pattern ( pattern itself
counts as a subexpression), then regexec() shall still do
the match, but shall record only the first nmatch sub-
strings.</p>

<p>When matching a basic or extended regular expression,
any given paren- thesized subexpression of pattern might
participate in the match of several different substrings of
string, or it might not match any sub- string even though
the pattern as a whole did match. The following rules shall
be used to determine which substrings to report in pmatch
when matching regular expressions:</p>

<p>1. If subexpression i in a regular expression is not
contained within another subexpression, and it participated
in the match several times, then the byte offsets in pmatch[
i] shall delimit the last such match.</p>

<p>2. If subexpression i is not contained within another
subexpression, and it did not participate in an otherwise
successful match, the byte offsets in pmatch[ i] shall be
-1. A subexpression does not participate in the match when:
* or }&quot; appears immediately after the subexpression in
a basic regular expression, or,, or &quot;{}&quot; appears
immediately after the subexpression in an extended regular
expression, and the subexpression did not match (matched 0
times)</p>

<p>or: |is used in an extended regular expression to select
this subex- pression or another, and the other subexpression
matched.</p>

<p>3. If subexpression i is contained within another
subexpression j, and i is not contained within any other
subexpression that is contained within j, and a match of
subexpression j is reported in pmatch[ j], then the match or
non-match of subexpression i reported in pmatch[ i] shall be
as described in 1. and 2. above, but within the sub- string
reported in pmatch[ j] rather than the whole string. The
offsets in pmatch[ i] are still relative to the start of
string.</p>

<p>4. If subexpression i is contained in subexpression j,
and the byte offsets in pmatch[ j] are -1, then the pointers
in pmatch[ i] shall also be -1.</p>

<p>5. If subexpression i matched a zero-length string, then
both byte offsets in pmatch[ i] shall be the byte offset of
the character or null terminator immediately following the
zero-length string.</p>

<p>If, when regexec() is called, the locale is different
from when the regular expression was compiled, the result is
undefined.</p>

<p>If REG_NEWLINE is not set in cflags, then a
&lt;newline&gt; in pattern or string shall be treated as an
ordinary character. If REG_NEWLINE is set, then
&lt;newline&gt; shall be treated as an ordinary character
except as follows:</p>

<p>1. A &lt;newline&gt; in string shall not be matched by a
period outside a bracket expression or by any form of a
non-matching list (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 9, Regular Expressions).</p>

<p>2. A circumflex (^) in pattern, when used to specify
expression anchoring (see the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3.8, BRE Expression
Anchoring), shall match the zero- length string immediately
after a &lt;newline&gt; in string, regardless of the setting
of REG_NOTBOL.</p>

<p>3. A dollar sign ($) in pattern, when used to specify
expression anchoring, shall match the zero-length string
immediately before a &lt;newline&gt; in string, regardless
of the setting of REG_NOTEOL.</p>

<p>The regfree() function frees any memory allocated by
regcomp() associ- ated with preg.</p>

<p>The following constants are defined as error return
values:</p>

<p>REG_NOMATCH regexec() failed to match.</p>

<p>REG_BADPAT Invalid regular expression.</p>

<p>REG_ECOLLATE Invalid collating element referenced.</p>

<p>REG_ECTYPE Invalid character class type referenced.</p>

<p>REG_EESCAPE Trailinin pattern.</p>

<p>REG_ESUBREG Number in digit&quot; invalid or in
error.</p>

<p>REG_EBRACK &quot;[]&quot; imbalance.</p>

<p>REG_EPAREN )&quot; or &quot;()&quot; imbalance.</p>

<p>REG_EBRACE }&quot; imbalance.</p>

<p>REG_BADBR Content of }&quot; invalid: not a number,
number too large, more than two numbers, first larger than
second.</p>

<p>REG_ERANGE Invalid endpoint in range expression.</p>

<p>REG_ESPACE Out of memory.</p>

<p>REG_BADRPT ,, or+not preceded by valid regular
expression.</p>

<p>The regerror() function provides a mapping from error
codes returned by regcomp() and regexec() to unspecified
printable strings. It generates a string corresponding to
the value of the errcode argument, which the application
shall ensure is the last non-zero value returned by reg-
comp() or regexec() with the given value of preg. If errcode
is not such a value, the content of the generated string is
unspecified.</p>

<p>If preg is a null pointer, but errcode is a value
returned by a previ- ous call to regexec() or regcomp(), the
regerror() still generates an error string corresponding to
the value of errcode, but it might not be as detailed under
some implementations.</p>

<p>If the errbuf_size argument is not 0, regerror() shall
place the gener- ated string into the buffer of size
errbuf_size bytes pointed to by errbuf. If the string
(including the terminating null) cannot fit in the buffer,
regerror() shall truncate the string and null-terminate the
result.</p>

<p>If errbuf_size is 0, regerror() shall ignore the errbuf
argument, and return the size of the buffer needed to hold
the generated string.</p>

<p>If the preg argument to regexec() or regfree() is not a
compiled regu- lar expression returned by regcomp(), the
result is undefined. A preg is no longer treated as a
compiled regular expression after it is given to
regfree().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the regcomp()
function shall return 0. Oth- erwise, it shall return an
integer value indicating an error as described in
&lt;regex.h&gt;, and the content of preg is undefined. If a
code is returned, the interpretation shall be as given in
&lt;regex.h&gt;.</p>

<p>If regcomp() detects an invalid RE, it may return
REG_BADPAT, or it may return one of the error codes that
more precisely describes the error.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the regexec() function shall
return 0. Oth- erwise, it shall return REG_NOMATCH to
indicate no match.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the regerror() function
shall return the number of bytes needed to hold the entire
generated string, including the null termination. If the
return value is greater than errbuf_size, the string
returned in the buffer pointed to by errbuf has been trun-
cated.</p>

<p>The regfree() function shall not return a value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES #include &lt;regex.h&gt;</p>

<p>/* * Match string against the extended regular
expression in * pattern, treating errors as no match. * *
Return 1 for match, 0 for no match. */</p>

<p>int match(const char *string, char *pattern) { int
status; regex_t re;</p>

<p>if (regcomp(&amp;re, pattern, REG_EXTENDED|REG_NOSUB) !=
0) { return(0); /* Report error. */ } status =
regexec(&amp;re, string, (size_t) 0, NULL, 0);
regfree(&amp;re); if (status != 0) { return(0); /* Report
error. */ } return(1); }</p>

<p>The following demonstrates how the REG_NOTBOL flag could
be used with regexec() to find all substrings in a line that
match a pattern sup- plied by a user. (For simplicity of the
example, very little error checking is done.)</p>

<p>(void) regcomp (&amp;re, pattern, 0); /* This call to
regexec() finds the first match on the line. */ error =
regexec (&amp;re, &amp;buffer[0], 1, &amp;pm, 0); while
(error == 0) { /* While matches found. */ /* Substring found
between pm.rm_so and pm.rm_eo. */ /* This call to regexec()
finds the next match. */ error = regexec (&amp;re, buffer +
pm.rm_eo, 1, &amp;pm, REG_NOTBOL); }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE An application could use:</p>

<p>regerror(code,preg,(char *)NULL,(size_t)0)</p>

<p>to find out how big a buffer is needed for the generated
string, malloc() a buffer to hold the string, and then call
regerror() again to get the string. Alternatively, it could
allocate a fixed, static buffer that is big enough to hold
most strings, and then use malloc() to allo- cate a larger
buffer if it finds that this is too small.</p>

<p>To match a pattern as described in the Shell and
Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 2.13,
Pattern Matching Notation, use the fnmatch() function.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The regexec() function must fill in all nmatch
elements of pmatch, where nmatch and pmatch are supplied by
the application, even if some elements of pmatch do not
correspond to subexpressions in pattern. The application
writer should note that there is probably no reason for
using a value of nmatch that is larger than preg-&gt;
re_nsub+1.</p>

<p>The REG_NEWLINE flag supports a use of RE matching that
is needed in some applications like text editors. In such
applications, the user supplies an RE asking the application
to find a line that matches the given expression. An anchor
in such an RE anchors at the beginning or end of any line.
Such an application can pass a sequence of &lt;new-
line&gt;-separated lines to regexec() as a single long
string and specify REG_NEWLINE to regcomp() to get the
desired behavior. The application must ensure that there are
no explicit &lt;newline&gt;s in pattern if it wants to
ensure that any match occurs entirely within a single
line.</p>

<p>The REG_NEWLINE flag affects the behavior of regexec(),
but it is in the cflags parameter to regcomp() to allow
flexibility of implementa- tion. Some implementations will
want to generate the same compiled RE in regcomp()
regardless of the setting of REG_NEWLINE and have regexec()
handle anchors differently based on the setting of the flag.
Other implementations will generate different compiled REs
based on the REG_NEWLINE.</p>

<p>The REG_ICASE flag supports the operations taken by the
grep -i option and the historical implementations of ex and
vi. Including this flag will make it easier for application
code to be written that does the same thing as these
utilities.</p>

<p>The substrings reported in pmatch[] are defined using
offsets from the start of the string rather than pointers.
Since this is a new inter- face, there should be no impact
on historical implementations or appli- cations, and offsets
should be just as easy to use as pointers. The change to
offsets was made to facilitate future extensions in which
the string to be searched is presented to regexec() in
blocks, allowing a string to be searched that is not all in
memory at once.</p>

<p>The type regoff_t is used for the elements of pmatch[]
to ensure that the application can represent either the
largest possible array in mem- ory (important for an
application conforming to the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) or the largest possible file
(important for an application using the extension where a
file is searched in chunks).</p>

<p>The standard developers rejected the inclusion of a
regsub() function that would be used to do substitutions for
a matched RE. While such a routine would be useful to some
applications, its utility would be much more limited than
the matching function described here. Both RE parsing and
substitution are possible to implement without support other
than that required by the ISO C standard, but matching is
much more complex than substituting. The only difficult part
of substitution, given the information supplied by
regexec(), is finding the next character in a string when
there can be multi-byte characters. That is a much larger
issue, and one that needs a more general solution.</p>

<p>The errno variable has not been used for error returns
to avoid filling the errno name space for this feature.</p>

<p>The interface is defined so that the matched substrings
rm_sp and rm_ep are in a separate regmatch_t structure
instead of in regex_t. This allows a single compiled RE to
be used simultaneously in several con- texts; in main() and
a signal handler, perhaps, or in multiple threads of
lightweight processes. (The preg argument to regexec() is
declared with type const, so the implementation is not
permitted to use the structure to store intermediate
results.) It also allows an application to request an
arbitrary number of substrings from an RE. The number of
subexpressions in the RE is reported in re_nsub in preg.
With this change to regexec(), consideration was given to
dropping the REG_NOSUB flag since the user can now specify
this with a zero nmatch argument to regexec(). However,
keeping REG_NOSUB allows an implementation to use a
different (perhaps more efficient) algorithm if it knows in
regcomp() that no subexpressions need be reported. The
implementation is only required to fill in pmatch if nmatch
is not zero and if REG_NOSUB is not specified. Note that the
size_t type, as defined in the ISO C stan- dard, is
unsigned, so the description of regexec() does not need to
address negative values of nmatch.</p>

<p>REG_NOTBOL was added to allow an application to do
repeated searches for the same pattern in a line. If the
pattern contains a circumflex character that should match
the beginning of a line, then the pattern should only match
when matched against the beginning of the line. With- out
the REG_NOTBOL flag, the application could rewrite the
expression for subsequent matches, but in the general case
this would require parsing the expression. The need for
REG_NOTEOL is not as clear; it was added for symmetry.</p>

<p>The addition of the regerror() function addresses the
historical need for conforming application programs to have
access to error information more than &quot;Function failed
to compile/match your RE for unknown rea- sons&quot;.</p>

<p>This interface provides for two different methods of
dealing with error conditions. The specific error codes
(REG_EBRACE, for example), defined in &lt;regex.h&gt;, allow
an application to recover from an error if it is so able.
Many applications, especially those that use patterns
supplied by a user, will not try to deal with specific error
cases, but will just use regerror() to obtain a
human-readable error message to present to the user.</p>

<p>The regerror() function uses a scheme similar to
confstr() to deal with the problem of allocating memory to
hold the generated string. The scheme used by strerror() in
the ISO C standard was considered unac- ceptable since it
creates difficulties for multi-threaded applications.</p>

<p>The preg argument is provided to regerror() to allow an
implementation to generate a more descriptive message than
would be possible with errcode alone. An implementation
might, for example, save the character offset of the
offending character of the pattern in a field of preg, and
then include that in the generated message string. The
implementa- tion may also ignore preg.</p>

<p>A REG_FILENAME flag was considered, but omitted. This
flag caused regexec() to match patterns as described in the
Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
2.13, Pattern Matching Notation instead of REs. This service
is now provided by the fnmatch() function.</p>

<p>Notice that there is a difference in philosophy between
the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard and IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 in
how to handle a &quot;bad&quot; regular expression. The ISO
POSIX-2:1993 standard says that many bad constructs
&quot;produce undefined results&quot;, or that &quot;the
interpretation is undefined&quot;. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
however, says that the interpreta- tion of such REs is
unspecified. The term &quot;undefined&quot; means that the
action by the application is an error, of similar severity
to passing a bad pointer to a function.</p>

<p>The regcomp() and regexec() functions are required to
accept any null- terminated string as the pattern argument.
If the meaning of the string is &quot;undefined&quot;, the
behavior of the function is &quot;unspecified&quot;. IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does not specify how the functions will
interpret the pattern; they might return error codes, or
they might do pattern matching in some completely unexpected
way, but they should not do something like abort the
process.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
