<p>FLOOR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FLOOR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME floor, floorf, floorl - floor function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double floor(double x); float floorf(float x); long
double floorl(long double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall compute the largest
integral value not greater than x.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the largest integral value not greater than x,
expressed as a double, float, or long double, as appropriate
for the return type of the function.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;0 or &plusmn;Inf, x shall be
returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error
shall occur and floor(), floorf(), and floorl() shall return
the value of the macro -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, and
-HUGE_VALL, respectively.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Range Error The result would cause an overflow.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The integral value returned by these
functions might not be expressible as an int or long. The
return value should be tested before assigning it to an
integer type to avoid the undefined results of an integer
overflow.</p>

<p>The floor() function can only overflow when the
floating-point repre- sentation has DBL_MANT_DIG &gt;
DBL_MAX_EXP.</p>

<p>On error, the expressions (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are
independent of each other, but at least one of them must be
non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
