<p>LOCALE(7) Linux Programmer s Manual LOCALE(7)</p>

<p>NAME locale - Description of multi-language support</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;locale.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A locale is a set of language and cultural
rules. These cover aspects such as language for messages,
different character sets, lexicographic conventions, etc. A
program needs to be able to determine its locale and act
accordingly to be portable to different cultures.</p>

<p>The header &lt;locale.h&gt; declares data types,
functions and macros which are useful in this task.</p>

<p>The functions it declares are setlocale(3) to set the
current locale, and localeconv(3) to get information about
number formatting.</p>

<p>There are different categories for local information a
program might need; they are declared as macros. Using them
as the first argument to the setlocale(3) function, it is
possible to set one of these to the desired locale:</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE This is used to change the behavior of the
functions strcoll(3) and strxfrm(3), which are used to
compare strings in the local alphabet. For example, the
German sharp s is sorted as &quot;ss&quot;.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE This changes the behavior of the character
handling and classi- fication functions, such as isupper(3)
and toupper(3), and the multi-byte character functions such
as mblen(3) or wctomb(3).</p>

<p>LC_MONETARY changes the information returned by
localeconv(3) which describes the way numbers are usually
printed, with details such as decimal point versus decimal
comma. This information is internally used by the function
strfmon(3).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES changes the language messages are displayed
in and what an affirmative or negative answer looks like.
The GNU C-library contains the gettext(3), ngettext(3), and
rpmatch(3) functions to ease the use of these information.
The GNU gettext family of functions also obey the
environment variable LANGUAGE (contain- ing a
colon-separated list of locales) if the category is set to a
valid locale other than &quot;C&quot;.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC changes the information used by the printf(3)
and scanf(3) fam- ily of functions, when they are advised to
use the locale-set- tings. This information can also be read
with the localeconv(3) function.</p>

<p>LC_TIME changes the behavior of the strftime(3) function
to display the current time in a locally acceptable form;
for example, most of Europe uses a 24-hour clock versus the
12-hour clock used in the United States.</p>

<p>LC_ALL All of the above.</p>

<p>If the second argument to setlocale(3) is empty string,
&quot;&quot;, for the default locale, it is determined using
the following steps:</p>

<p>1. If there is a non-null environment variable LC_ALL,
the value of LC_ALL is used.</p>

<p>2. If an environment variable with the same name as one
of the cat- egories above exists and is non-null, its value
is used for that category.</p>

<p>3. If there is a non-null environment variable LANG, the
value of LANG is used.</p>

<p>Values about local numeric formatting is made available
in a struct lconv returned by the localeconv(3) function,
which has the following declaration:</p>

<p>struct lconv {</p>

<p>/* Numeric (non-monetary) information */</p>

<p>char *decimal_point; /* Radix character */ char
*thousands_sep; /* Separator for digit groups to left of
radix character */ char *grouping; /* Each element is the
number of digits in a group; elements with higher indices
are further left. An element with value CHAR_MAX means that
no further grouping is done. An element with value 0 means
that the previous element is used for all groups further
left. */</p>

<p>/* Remaining fields are for monetary information */</p>

<p>char *int_curr_symbol; /* First three chars are a
currency symbol from ISO 4217. Fourth char is the separator.
Fifth char is &rsquo; &rsquo;. */ char *currency_symbol; /*
Local currency symbol */ char *mon_decimal_point; /* Radix
character */ char *mon_thousands_sep; /* Like thousands_sep
above */ char *mon_grouping; /* Like grouping above */ char
*positive_sign; /* Sign for positive values */ char
*negative_sign; /* Sign for negative values */ char
int_frac_digits; /* International fractional digits */ char
frac_digits; /* Local fractional digits */ char
p_cs_precedes; /* 1 if currency_symbol precedes a positive
value, 0 if succeeds */ char p_sep_by_space; /* 1 if a space
separates currency_symbol from a positive value */ char
n_cs_precedes; /* 1 if currency_symbol precedes a negative
value, 0 if succeeds */ char n_sep_by_space; /* 1 if a space
separates currency_symbol from a negative value */ /*
Positive and negative sign positions: 0 Parentheses surround
the quantity and currency_symbol. 1 The sign string precedes
the quantity and currency_symbol. 2 The sign string succeeds
the quantity and currency_symbol. 3 The sign string
immediately precedes the currency_symbol. 4 The sign string
immediately succeeds the currency_symbol. */ char
p_sign_posn; char n_sign_posn; };</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>The GNU gettext functions are specified in
LI18NUX2000.</p>
