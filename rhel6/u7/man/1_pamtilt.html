<p>NAME pamtilt - print the tilt angle of a PGM file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtilt [-angle=maxangle] [-fast] [-quality=q]
[-hstep=n] [-vstep=n] [-dstep=n] [-astep=n] [-verbose]
[pgmfile]</p>

<p>EXAMPLES scanimage --mode Gray --resolution 300
&gt;crooked.pgm pnmrotate -b white pamtilt crooked.pgm
crooked.pgm &gt;straight.pgm (then crop, threshold,
etc.)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtilt tries to find the correct angle for untilting
(de-skewing) a scanned text document. The output is a single
floating-point number (the angle in degrees) for use as the
argument to pnmrotate.</p>

<p>Document skew is the name given to what happens when you
feed a page into an image scanner at an angle: the resulting
image is tilted. pamtilt aims to correct that.</p>

<p>pamtilt makes three iterations at successively finer
increments, test- ing prospective rotation angles to find
the best one. pamtilt works best for straightening images
with strong horizontal lines and does poorly with arbitrary
photos. If pamtilt has no confidence in its results, it
prints the special value 00.00; you can check for this or
just pass it as a legal argument to pnmrotate.</p>

<p>pamtilt operates on the first plane of the input image,
which is either PNM or PAM, and ignores any other planes.
Ordinarily, the input is PGM or GRAYSCALE PAM, so there is
only one plane.</p>

<p>pamtilt works on bilevel (PBM, BLACKANDWHITE PAM) images
as well as grayscale, but you will minimize artifacts if you
scan and rotate in grayscale before you apply a threshold to
make a bilevel image.</p>

<p>OPTIONS A few options have general utility:</p>

<p>-angle=maxangle Assume a maximum tilt angle of maxangle
(measured in degrees). The default value is sufficient for
most images, even those scanned somewhat carelessly.</p>

<p>The default is 10.0.</p>

<p>-fast Skip the third iteration for speed at the expense
of accuracy.</p>

<p>-verbose Show on Standard Error the measurements
computed at each tested angle.</p>

<p>Here are some other options you can use to tune the
operation of pamtilt but theyre seldom needed. The default
values accommodate a wide variety of input documents.</p>

<p>-quality=q Require a signal-to-noise ratio of a least q
on the first itera- tion to report a valid result. Larger
values reduce the chances of obtaining a bogus result at the
risk of obtaining no result at all.</p>

<p>The default is 1.0.</p>

<p>-hstep=n Set the horizontal increment to check every nth
column. This value affects both run time and memory
requirements.</p>

<p>The default is 11.</p>

<p>-vstep=n Set the vertical increment to check every nth
row. Larger val- ues usually work, reducing run time, but
they increase the risk of incorrect results.</p>

<p>The default is 5.</p>

<p>-dstep=n Set the vertical distance used when checking
pixels in a column. The default is intended to minimize the
effect of noise along a horizontal boundary.</p>

<p>The default is 2.</p>

<p>-astep=n Set the angle increment of the first iteration,
in degrees.</p>

<p>The default is 1.0.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtilt was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October
2005).</p>

<p>Gregg Townsend wrote it and sent it to Bryan Henderson
in August 2005. Bryan recoded it to fit Netpbm
conventions.</p>
