<p>UMOUNT(8) Linux Programmer s Manual UMOUNT(8)</p>

<p>NAME umount - unmount file systems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS umount [-hV]</p>

<p>umount -a [-dflnrv] [-t vfstype] [-O options] umount
[-dflnrv] {dir|device}...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The umount command detaches the file
system(s) mentioned from the file hierarchy. A file system
is specified by giving the directory where it has been
mounted. Giving the special device on which the file system
lives may also work, but is obsolete, mainly because it will
fail in case this device was mounted on more than one
directory.</p>

<p>Note that a file system cannot be unmounted when it is
busy - for example, when there are open files on it, or when
some process has its working directory there, or when a swap
file on it is in use. The offending process could even be
umount itself - it opens libc, and libc in its turn may open
for example locale files. A lazy unmount avoids this
problem.</p>

<p>Options for the umount command:</p>

<p>-V Print version and exit.</p>

<p>-h Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p>-n Unmount without writing in /etc/mtab.</p>

<p>-r In case unmounting fails, try to remount
read-only.</p>

<p>-d In case the unmounted device was a loop device, also
free this loop device.</p>

<p>-i Dont call the /sbin/umount.&lt;filesystem&gt; helper
even if it exists. By default
/sbin/umount.&lt;filesystem&gt; helper is called if one
exists.</p>

<p>-a All of the file systems described in /etc/mtab are
unmounted. (With umount version 2.7 and later: the proc
filesystem is not unmounted.)</p>

<p>-t vfstype Indicate that the actions should only be
taken on file systems of the specified type. More than one
type may be specified in a comma separated list. The list of
file system types can be pre- fixed with no to specify the
file system types on which no action should be taken.</p>

<p>-O options Indicate that the actions should only be
taken on file systems with the specified options in
/etc/fstab. More than one option type may be specified in a
comma separated list. Each option can be prefixed with no to
specify options for which no action should be taken.</p>

<p>-f Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system).
(Requires kernel 2.1.116 or later.)</p>

<p>-l Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the
filesystem hierar- chy now, and cleanup all references to
the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore. (Requires
kernel 2.4.11 or later.)</p>

<p>--no-canonicalize Don t canonicalize paths. For more
details about this option see the mount(8) man page.</p>

<p>--fake Causes everything to be done except for the
actual system call; this fakes unmounting the filesystem. It
can be used to remove entries from /etc/mtab that were
unmounted earlier with the -n option.</p>

<p>THE LOOP DEVICE The umount command will free the loop
device (if any) associated with the mount, in case it finds
the option loop=... in /etc/mtab, or when the -d option was
given. Any pending loop devices can be freed using losetup
-d, see losetup(8).</p>

<p>NOTES The syntax of external umount helpers is:</p>

<p>/sbin/umount.&lt;suffix&gt; {dir|device} [-nlfvr] [-t
type.subtype]</p>

<p>where the &lt;suffix&gt; is filesystem type or a value
from &quot;uhelper=&quot; mtab option. The -t option is used
for filesystems with subtypes support (for example
/sbin/mount.fuse -t fuse.sshfs).</p>

<p>The uhelper (unprivileged umount helper) is possible to
used when non- root user wants to umount a mountpoint which
is not defined in the /etc/fstab file (e.g devices mounted
by HAL).</p>

<p>FILES /etc/mtab table of mounted file systems</p>

<p>SEE ALSO umount(2), mount(8), losetup(8).</p>

<p>HISTORY A umount command appeared in Version 6 AT&amp;T
UNIX.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The umount command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is avail- able from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
