<p>xcb_set_input_focus(3) XCB Requests
xcb_set_input_focus(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_set_input_focus - Sets input focus</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_void_cookie_t
xcb_set_input_focus(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t
revert_to, xcb_window_t focus, xcb_timestamp_t time);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>revert_to One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_NONE The focus reverts to XCB_NONE, so
no window will have the input focus.</p>

<p>XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_POINTER_ROOT The focus reverts to
XCB_POINTER_ROOT respectively. When the focus reverts,
FocusIn and FocusOut events are generated, but the
last-focus-change time is not changed.</p>

<p>XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_PARENT The focus reverts to the parent
(or closest view- able ancestor) and the new revert_to value
is XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_NONE.</p>

<p>XCB_INPUT_FOCUS_FOLLOW_KEYBOARD NOT YET DOCUMENTED. Only
relevant for the xinput extension.</p>

<p>Specifies what happens when the focus window becomes
unview- able (if focus is neither XCB_NONE nor
XCB_POINTER_ROOT).</p>

<p>focus The window to focus. All keyboard events will be
reported to this window. The window must be viewable (TODO),
or a xcb_match_error_t occurs (TODO).</p>

<p>If focus is XCB_NONE (TODO), all keyboard events are
discard- ed until a new focus window is set.</p>

<p>If focus is XCB_POINTER_ROOT (TODO), focus is on the
root window of the screen on which the pointer is on
currently.</p>

<p>time Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X
over the network.</p>

<p>The special value XCB_CURRENT_TIME will be replaced with
the current server time.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Changes the input focus and the
last-focus-change time. If the speci- fied time is earlier
than the current last-focus-change time, the re- quest is
ignored (to avoid race conditions when running X over the
net- work).</p>

<p>A FocusIn and FocusOut event is generated when focus is
changed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if
any) have to be handled in the event loop.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors directly with
xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_set_input_focus_checked.
See xcb-requests(3) for details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_window_error_t The specified focus window
does not exist.</p>

<p>xcb_value_error_t TODO: Reasons?</p>

<p>xcb_match_error_t The specified focus window is not
viewable.</p>
