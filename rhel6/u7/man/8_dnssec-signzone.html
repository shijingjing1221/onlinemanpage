<p>DESCRIPTION dnssec-signzone signs a zone. It generates
NSEC and RRSIG records and produces a signed version of the
zone. The security status of delegations from the signed
zone (that is, whether the child zones are secure or not) is
determined by the presence or absence of a keyset file for
each child zone.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Verify all generated signatures.</p>

<p>-c class Specifies the DNS class of the zone.</p>

<p>-C Compatibility mode: Generate a keyset-zonename file
in addition to dsset-zonename when signing a zone, for use
by older versions of dnssec-signzone.</p>

<p>-d directory Look for dsset- or keyset- files in
directory.</p>

<p>-E engine Uses a crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine) for
the crypto operations it supports, for instance signing with
private keys from a secure key store. When compiled with
PKCS#11 support it defaults to pkcs11; the empty name resets
it to no engine.</p>

<p>-g Generate DS records for child zones from dsset- or
keyset- file. Existing DS records will be removed.</p>

<p>-K directory Key repository: Specify a directory to
search for DNSSEC keys. If not specified, defaults to the
current directory.</p>

<p>-k key Treat specified key as a key signing key ignoring
any key flags. This option may be specified multiple
times.</p>

<p>-l domain Generate a DLV set in addition to the key
(DNSKEY) and DS sets. The domain is appended to the name of
the records.</p>

<p>-s start-time Specify the date and time when the
generated RRSIG records become valid. This can be either an
absolute or relative time. An absolute start time is
indicated by a number in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation;
20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000. A
relative start time is indicated by +N, which is N seconds
from the current time. If no start-time is specified, the
current time minus 1 hour (to allow for clock skew) is
used.</p>

<p>-e end-time Specify the date and time when the generated
RRSIG records expire. As with start-time, an absolute time
is indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time relative to
the start time is indicated with +N, which is N seconds from
the start time. A time relative to the current time is
indicated with now+N. If no end-time is specified, 30 days
from the start time is used as a default. end-time must be
later than start-time.</p>

<p>-f output-file The name of the output file containing
the signed zone. The default is to append .signed to the
input filename.</p>

<p>-h Prints a short summary of the options and arguments
to dnssec-signzone.</p>

<p>-i interval When a previously-signed zone is passed as
input, records may be resigned. The interval option
specifies the cycle interval as an offset from the current
time (in seconds). If a RRSIG record expires after the cycle
interval, it is retained. Otherwise, it is considered to be
expiring soon, and it will be replaced.</p>

<p>The default cycle interval is one quarter of the
difference between the signature end and start times. So if
neither end-time or start-time are specified,
dnssec-signzone generates signatures that are valid for 30
days, with a cycle interval of 7.5 days. Therefore, if any
existing RRSIG records are due to expire in less than 7.5
days, they would be replaced.</p>

<p>-I input-format The format of the input zone file.
Possible formats are &quot;text&quot; (default) and
&quot;raw&quot;. This option is primarily intended to be
used for dynamic signed zones so that the dumped zone file
in a non-text format containing updates can be signed
directly. The use of this option does not make much sense
for non-dynamic zones.</p>

<p>-j jitter When signing a zone with a fixed signature
lifetime, all RRSIG records issued at the time of signing
expires simultaneously. If the zone is incrementally signed,
i.e. a previously-signed zone is passed as input to the
signer, all expired signatures have to be regenerated at
about the same time. The jitter option specifies a jitter
window that will be used to randomize the signature expire
time, thus spreading incremental signature regeneration over
time.</p>

<p>Signature lifetime jitter also to some extent benefits
validators and servers by spreading out cache expiration,
i.e. if large numbers of RRSIGs dont expire at the same time
from all caches there will be less congestion than if all
validators need to refetch at mostly the same time.</p>

<p>-n ncpus Specifies the number of threads to use. By
default, one thread is started for each detected CPU.</p>

<p>-N soa-serial-format The SOA serial number format of the
signed zone. Possible formats are &quot;keep&quot;
(default), &quot;increment&quot; and
&quot;unixtime&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;keep&quot; Do not modify the SOA serial
number.</p>

<p>&quot;increment&quot; Increment the SOA serial number
using RFC 1982 arithmetics.</p>

<p>&quot;unixtime&quot; Set the SOA serial number to the
number of seconds since epoch.</p>

<p>-o origin The zone origin. If not specified, the name of
the zone file is assumed to be the origin.</p>

<p>-O output-format The format of the output file
containing the signed zone. Possible formats are
&quot;text&quot; (default) and &quot;raw&quot;.</p>

<p>-p Use pseudo-random data when signing the zone. This is
faster, but less secure, than using real random data. This
option may be useful when signing large zones or when the
entropy source is limited.</p>

<p>-P Disable post sign verification tests.</p>

<p>The post sign verification test ensures that for each
algorithm in use there is at least one non revoked self
signed KSK key, that all revoked KSK keys are self signed,
and that all records in the zone are signed by the
algorithm. This option skips these tests.</p>

<p>-r randomdev Specifies the source of randomness. If the
operating system does not provide a /dev/random or
equivalent device, the default source of randomness is
keyboard input. randomdev specifies the name of a character
device or file containing random data to be used instead of
the default. The special value keyboard indicates that
keyboard input should be used.</p>

<p>-S Smart signing: Instructs dnssec-signzone to search
the key repository for keys that match the zone being
signed, and to include them in the zone if appropriate.</p>

<p>When a key is found, its timing metadata is examined to
determine how it should be used, according to the following
rules. Each successive rule takes priority over the prior
ones:</p>

<p>If no timing metadata has been set for the key, the key
is published in the zone and used to sign the zone.</p>

<p>If the keys publication date is set and is in the past,
the key is published in the zone.</p>

<p>If the keys activation date is set and in the past, the
key is published (regardless of publication date) and used
to sign the zone.</p>

<p>If the keys revocation date is set and in the past, and
the key is published, then the key is revoked, and the
revoked key is used to sign the zone.</p>

<p>If either of the key s unpublication or deletion dates
are set and in the past, the key is NOT published or used to
sign the zone, regardless of any other metadata.</p>

<p>-T ttl Specifies the TTL to be used for new DNSKEY
records imported into the zone from the key repository. If
not specified, the default is the minimum TTL value from the
zones SOA record. This option is ignored when signing
without -S, since DNSKEY records are not imported from the
key repository in that case. It is also ignored if there are
any pre-existing DNSKEY records at the zone apex, in which
case new records TTL values will be set to match them.</p>

<p>-t Print statistics at completion.</p>

<p>-u Update NSEC/NSEC3 chain when re-signing a previously
signed zone. With this option, a zone signed with NSEC can
be switched to NSEC3, or a zone signed with NSEC3 can be
switch to NSEC or to NSEC3 with different parameters.
Without this option, dnssec-signzone will retain the
existing chain when re-signing.</p>

<p>-v level Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p>-x Only sign the DNSKEY RRset with key-signing keys, and
omit signatures from zone-signing keys. (This is similar to
the dnssec-dnskey-kskonly yes; zone option in named.)</p>

<p>-z Ignore KSK flag on key when determining what to sign.
This causes KSK-flagged keys to sign all records, not just
the DNSKEY RRset. (This is similar to the update-check-ksk
no; zone option in named.)</p>

<p>-3 salt Generate an NSEC3 chain with the given hex
encoded salt. A dash (salt) can be used to indicate that no
salt is to be used when generating the NSEC3 chain.</p>

<p>-H iterations When generating an NSEC3 chain, use this
many interations. The default is 10.</p>

<p>-A When generating an NSEC3 chain set the OPTOUT flag on
all NSEC3 records and do not generate NSEC3 records for
insecure delegations.</p>

<p>Using this option twice (i.e., -AA) turns the OPTOUT
flag off for all records. This is useful when using the -u
option to modify an NSEC3 chain which previously had OPTOUT
set.</p>

<p>zonefile The file containing the zone to be signed.</p>

<p>key Specify which keys should be used to sign the zone.
If no keys are specified, then the zone will be examined for
DNSKEY records at the zone apex. If these are found and
there are matching private keys, in the current directory,
then these will be used for signing.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following command signs the example.com zone
with the DSA key generated by dnssec-keygen
(Kexample.com.+003+17247). Because the -S option is not
being used, the zones keys must be in the master file
(db.example.com). This invocation looks for dsset files, in
the current directory, so that DS records can be imported
from them (-g).</p>

<p>% dnssec-signzone -g -o example.com db.example.com
Kexample.com.+003+17247 db.example.com.signed %</p>

<p>In the above example, dnssec-signzone creates the file
db.example.com.signed. This file should be referenced in a
zone statement in a named.conf file.</p>

<p>This example re-signs a previously signed zone with
default parameters. The private keys are assumed to be in
the current directory.</p>

<p>% cp db.example.com.signed db.example.com %
dnssec-signzone -o example.com db.example.com
db.example.com.signed %</p>
