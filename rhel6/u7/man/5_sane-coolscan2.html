<p>sane-coolscan2(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-coolscan2(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-coolscan2 - SANE backend for Nikon Coolscan
film scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-coolscan2 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Nikon Coolscan film scanners. Some functions of this backend
should be considered beta-quality software. Most functions
have been stable for a long time, but of course new
development can not and will not function properly from the
very first day. Please report any strange behaviour to the
maintainer of the back- end.</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known to work
with this backend:</p>

<p>Model: Connection Type ---------------------------
------------------- LS-30 (Coolscan III) SCSI LS-2000 SCSI
LS-40 ED (Coolscan IV) USB LS-4000 ED IEEE 1394 LS-8000 ED
IEEE 1394</p>

<p>Please send mail to the backend author
(andras@users.sourceforge.net) to report successes or
failures.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options the backend supports can either be
selected through command line options to programs like
scanimage or through GUI elements in xscanimage or
xsane.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d
coolscan2:&lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt; where
&lt;interface&gt; and &lt;device&gt; specify the device in
question, as in the configuration file (see next section).
The -d parameter and its argument can be omitted to obtain
information on the first scanner identified. Use the command
scanimage -L to list all devices recognized by your SANE
installation.</p>

<p>The options should be fully described by the description
or tooltips given by frontend. Here is a description of some
of the most important options, in the syntax with which they
must be supplied to scanimage:</p>

<p>--frame &lt;n&gt; This option specifies which frame to
operate on, if a motorized film strip feeder or APS adapter
are used. The frame number &lt;n&gt; ranges from 1 to the
number of frames available, which is sensed each time the
backend is initialized (usually each time you start the
frontend).</p>

<p>--subframe &lt;x&gt; This option shifts the scan window
by the specified amount (default unit is mm).</p>

<p>--infrared=yes/no If set to &quot;yes&quot;, the scanner
will read the infrared channel, thus allowing defect removal
in software. The infrared image is read during a second
scan, with no options altered. The backend must not be
restarted between the scans. If you use scanimage, perform a
batch scan with batch-count=2 to obtain the IR
information.</p>

<p>--depth &lt;n&gt; Here &lt;n&gt; can either be 8 or the
maximum number of bits supported by the scanner (10, 12, or
14). It specifies whether or not the scanner reduces the
scanned data to 8 bits before sending it to the backend. If
8 bits are used, some information and thus image quality is
lost, but the amount of data is smaller compared to higher
depths. Also, many imaging programs and image formats cannot
handle depths greater than 8 bits.</p>

<p>--autofocus Perform autofocus operation. Unless
otherwise specified by the other options ( --focus-on-centre
and friends), focusing is per- formed on the centre of the
selected scan area.</p>

<p>--ae-wb</p>

<p>--ae Perform a pre-scan to calculate exposure values
automatically. --ae-wb will maintain the white balance,
while --ae will adjust each channel separately.</p>

<p>--exposure Multiply all exposure times with this value.
This allows expo- sure correction without modifying white
balance.</p>

<p>--load Load the next slide when using the slide
loader.</p>

<p>--eject Eject the film strip or mounted slide when using
the slide loader.</p>

<p>--reset Reset scanner. The scanner will perform the same
action as when power is turned on: it will eject the film
strip and calibrate itself. Use this whenever the scanner
refuses to load a film strip properly, as a result of which
--eject does not work.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/coolscan2.conf specifies the device(s) that the
backend will use. Owing to the nature of the sup- ported
connection types SCSI, USB, and IEEE 1394, the default
configu- ration file supplied with the SANE distribution
should work without being edited.</p>

<p>Each line in the configuration file is either of the
following, where all entries are case-sensitive:</p>

<p>blank or starting with a #_character These lines are
ignored, thus # can be used to include com- ments.</p>

<p>containing only the word &quot;auto&quot; This instructs
the backend to probe for a scanner by scanning the buses for
devices with know identifiers. This is the action taken when
no configuration file is present.</p>

<p>a line of the form &lt;interface&gt;:&lt;device&gt; Here
&lt;interface&gt; can be one of &quot;scsi&quot; or
&quot;usb&quot;, and &lt;device&gt; is the device file of
the scanner. Note that IEEE 1394 devices are handled by the
SBP-2 module in the kernel and appear to SANE as SCSI
devices.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-coolscan2.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-coolscan2.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>/etc/sane.d/coolscan2.conf Configuration file for this
backend, read each time the backend is initialized.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_COOLSCAN2 If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>

xscanimage(1), xsane(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Currently, the SANE protocol does not allow
automatically updating options whenever the hardware
changes. Thus the number of choices for the --frame option
will be fixed when the backend is initialized (usu- ally
when the user runs the frontend). In particular, if there is
no film strip in the automatic film strip feeder when the
backend is ini- tialized, the frame option will not appear
at all. Also, restarting the frontend after swapping film
adapters is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>Linux kernels prior to 2.4.19 had a patch that truncated
INQUIRY data from IEEE 1394 scanners to 36 bytes, discarding
vital information about the scanner. The IEEE 1394 models
therefore only work with 2.4.19 or later.</p>

<p>No real bugs currently known, please report any to the
backend main- tainer or the SANE developers email list.</p>

<p>AUTHORS The backend is written and maintained by
Andr&aacute;s Major (andras@users.sourceforge.net).</p>
