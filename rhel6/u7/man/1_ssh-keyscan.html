<p>SSH-KEYSCAN(1) BSD General Commands Manual
SSH-KEYSCAN(1)</p>

<p>NAME ssh-keyscan - gather ssh public keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ssh-keyscan [-46Hv] [-f file] [-p port] [-T
timeout] [-t type] [host | addrlist namelist] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ssh-keyscan is a utility for gathering the
public ssh host keys of a num- ber of hosts. It was designed
to aid in building and verifying ssh_known_hosts files.
ssh-keyscan provides a minimal interface suitable for use by
shell and perl scripts.</p>

<p>ssh-keyscan uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as
many hosts as pos- sible in parallel, so it is very
efficient. The keys from a domain of 1,000 hosts can be
collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those hosts
are down or do not run ssh. For scanning, one does not need
login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor
does the scanning pro- cess involve any encryption.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-4 Forces ssh-keyscan to use IPv4 addresses only.</p>

<p>-6 Forces ssh-keyscan to use IPv6 addresses only.</p>

<p>-f file Read hosts or addrlist namelist pairs from this
file, one per line. If - is supplied instead of a filename,
ssh-keyscan will read hosts or addrlist namelist pairs from
the standard input.</p>

<p>-H Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output.
Hashed names may be used normally by ssh and sshd, but they
do not reveal identi- fying information should the file s
contents be disclosed.</p>

<p>-p port Port to connect to on the remote host.</p>

<p>-T timeout Set the timeout for connection attempts. If
timeout seconds have elapsed since a connection was
initiated to a host or since the last time anything was read
from that host, then the connection is closed and the host
in question considered unavailable. Default is 5
seconds.</p>

<p>-t type Specifies the type of the key to fetch from the
scanned hosts. The possible values are rsa1 for protocol
version 1 and dsa, ecdsa or rsa for protocol version 2.
Multiple values may be specified by separating them with
commas. The default is rsa.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. Causes ssh-keyscan to print debugging
messages about its progress.</p>

<p>SECURITY If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using
ssh-keyscan without veri- fying the keys, users will be
vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. On the other hand,
if the security model allows such a risk, ssh-keyscan can
help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man in the
middle attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts
file was created.</p>

<p>FILES Input format:</p>

<p>1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4
name.my.domain,name,n.my.domain,n,1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4</p>

<p>Output format for rsa1 keys:</p>

<p>host-or-namelist bits exponent modulus</p>

<p>Output format for rsa, dsa and ecdsa keys:</p>

<p>host-or-namelist keytype base64-encoded-key</p>

<p>Where keytype is either ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ,
ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, ssh-dss or
ssh-rsa.</p>

<p>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Print the rsa host key for machine
hostname:</p>

<p>$ ssh-keyscan hostname</p>

<p>Find all hosts from the file ssh_hosts which have new or
different keys from those in the sorted file
ssh_known_hosts:</p>

<p>$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa,ecdsa -f ssh_hosts | sort -u -
ssh_known_hosts | diff ssh_known_hosts -</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ssh(1), sshd(8)</p>

<p>AUTHORS David Mazieres dm@lcs.mit.edu wrote the initial
version, and Wayne Davison wayned@users.sourceforge.net
added support for protocol version 2.</p>

<p>BUGS It generates &quot;Connection closed by remote
host&quot; messages on the consoles of all the machines it
scans if the server is older than version 2.9. This is
because it opens a connection to the ssh port, reads the
public key, and drops the connection as soon as it gets the
key.</p>
