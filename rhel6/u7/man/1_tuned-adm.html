<p>TUNED_ADM(1) TUNED_ADM(1)</p>

<p>NAME tuned-adm - commandline tool for switching between
different tuning profiles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tuned-adm [ help , list , active , profile
&lt;profile&gt; , off ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command line utility allows user to
switch between user definable tuning profiles. Several
predefined profiles are already included for some of the
more common cases. Although the profiles typically refer to
a common use case you can of course switch to any profile on
any sys- tem. So switching to the laptop-battery-powersave
profile on a server will activate this profile on it. This
way, depending on your require- ments you can select any of
the profiles that fits your needs. You can even create your
own profile, either based on one of the existing ones by
copying it or make a completely new one. The profiles are
stored in subdirectories below /etc/tune-profiles.</p>

<p>OPTIONS help Print out the list of commands. Its also
the default if you start tuned-adm without any commands.</p>

<p>list List all available profiles.</p>

<p>active Show current active profile.</p>

<p>profile &lt;profile&gt; Switches to the given
profilename. If none is given or no valid one is given the
command gracefully exits without performing any
operation.</p>

<p>off Switch off all ktune and tuned settings and remove
them from services. The configuration file are set to
previous settings.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/tune-profiles/*</p>
