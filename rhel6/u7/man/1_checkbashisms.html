<p>CHECKBASHISMS(1) CHECKBASHISMS(1)</p>

<p>NAME checkbashisms - check for bashisms in /bin/sh
scripts</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS checkbashisms script ... checkbashisms
--help|--version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION checkbashisms, based on one of the checks
from the lintian system, per- forms basic checks on /bin/sh
shell scripts for the possible presence of bashisms. It
takes the names of the shell scripts on the command line,
and outputs warnings if possible bashisms are detected.</p>

<p>Note that the definition of a bashism in this context
roughly equates to &quot;a shell feature that is not
required to be supported by POSIX&quot;; this means that
some issues flagged may be permitted under optional sections
of POSIX, such as XSI or User Portability.</p>

<p>In cases where POSIX and Debian Policy disagree,
checkbashisms by default allows extensions permitted by
Policy but may also provide options for stricter
checking.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help, -h Show a summary of options.</p>

<p>--newline, -n Check for &quot;echo -n&quot; usage (non
POSIX but required by Debian Pol- icy 10.4.)</p>

<p>--posix, -p Check for issues which are non POSIX but
required to be sup- ported by Debian Policy 10.4 (implies
-n).</p>

<p>--force, -f Force each script to be checked, even if it
would normally not be (for instance, it has a bash or non
POSIX shell shebang or appears to be a shell wrapper).</p>

<p>--extra, -x Highlight lines which, whilst they do not
contain bashisms, may be useful in determining whether a
particular issue is a false positive which may be ignored.
For example, the use of &quot;$BASH_ENV&quot; may be
preceeded by checking whether &quot;$BASH&quot; is set.</p>

<p>--version, -v Show version and copyright
information.</p>

<p>EXIT VALUES The exit value will be 0 if no possible
bashisms or other problems were detected. Otherwise it will
be the sum of the following error values:</p>

<p>1 A possible bashism was detected.</p>

<p>2 A file was skipped for some reason, for example,
because it was unreadable or not found. The warning message
will give details.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO lintian(1).</p>

<p>AUTHOR checkbashisms was originally written as a shell
script by Yann Dirson &lt;dirson@debian.org&gt; and
rewritten in Perl with many more features by Julian Gilbey
&lt;jdg@debian.org&gt;.</p>
