<p>NAME nmcli - command-line tool for controlling
NetworkManager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nmcli [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }</p>

<p>OBJECT := { nm | con | dev }</p>

<p>OPTIONS := { -t[erse] -p[retty] -m[mode] tabular |
multiline -f[ields] &lt;field1,field2,...&gt; | all | common
-e[scape] yes | no -v[ersion] -h[elp] }</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION nmcli is a command-line tool for controlling
NetworkManager and getting its status. It is not meant as a
replacement of nm-applet or other similar clients. Rather
its a complementary utility to these pro- grams. The main
nmcli s usage is on servers, headless machines or just for
power users who prefer the command line.</p>

<p>The use cases comprise:</p>

<p>Initscripts: ifup/ifdown can utilize NetworkManager via
nmcli instead of having to manage connections itself and
possible inter- fere with NetworkManager.</p>

<p>Servers, headless machines: No GUI is available; then
nmcli is used to talk directly to NetworkManager and control
only system-wide connections.</p>

<p>User sessions: For this case, nmcli can talk to
nm-applet to find user connections. It can still talk
directly to NetworkManager for manipulating these
connections. As nmcli doesnt have direct access to user
configuration data in GConf, nm-applet handles that itself.
That may, for example, cause the applet to pop up keyring
dialogs when secrets are needed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -t, --terse Output is terse. This mode is
designed and suitable for com- puter (script)
processing.</p>

<p>-p, --pretty Output is pretty. This causes nmcli to
produce easy readable outputs for humans, i.e. values are
aligned, headers are printed, etc.</p>

<p>-m, --mode tabular | multiline Switch between tabular
and multiline output. If omitted, default is tabular for
most commands. For the commands produc- ing more structured
information, that cannot be displayed on a single line,
default is multiline. Currenly, they are: nmcli con list
id|uuid &lt;name&gt; nmcli dev list tabular - Output is a
table where each line describes a single entry. Columns
define particular properties of the entry. multiline - Each
entry comprises more lines, each property on its own line.
The values are prefixed with the property name.</p>

<p>-f, --fields &lt;field1,field2,...&gt; | all | common
This option is used to specify what fields (column names)
should be printed. Valid field names differ for specific
commands. List available fields by providing an invalid
value to the --fields option. all is used to print all valid
field values of the command. common is used to print common
field values of the command. If omitted, default is common.
The option is mandatory when --terse is used. In this case,
generic values all and common cannot be used. (This is to
maintain compatibility when new fields are added in the
future).</p>

<p>-e, --escape yes | no Whether to escape : and characters
in terse tabular mode. The escape character is . If omitted,
default is yes.</p>

<p>-v, --version Show nmcli version.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help information.</p>

<p>OBJECT nm NetworkManager Use this object to inquire and
change state of NetworkManager.</p>

<p>COMMAND := { status | sleep | wakeup | wifi | wwan }</p>

<p>status Show overall status of NetworkManager. This is
the default action, when no command is provided to nm
object. Reference to D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>sleep Put NetworkManager to sleeping mode. Thus all
interfaces that NetworkManager manages are deactivated.
Reference to D-Bus: interface:
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager method: Sleep arguments:
TRUE</p>

<p>wakeup Awake NetworkManager from sleep. When
NetworkManager is awaken, devices are available to be
activated. Reference to D-Bus: interface:
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager method: Sleep arguments:
FALSE</p>

<p>wifi [on|off] Inquire or set status of WiFi in
NetworkManager. Without any further argument, WiFi status is
printed; on enables WiFi; off disables WiFi. Reference to
D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>wwan [on|off] Inquire or set status of WWAN in
NetworkManager. Without any further argument, WWAN status is
printed; on enables WWAN; off disables WWAN. Reference to
D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>con Connections Get information about NetworkManagers
connections.</p>

<p>COMMAND := { list | status | up | down }</p>

<p>list [id &lt;id&gt; | uuid &lt;id&gt; | system | user]
List configured connections. Without a parameter, con-
figured connection from both system and user settings
services are listed. system argument filters only sys-
tem-wide connections, user prints user connections only. In
order to get connection details, id with connections name or
uuid with connections UUID shall be specified. When no
command is given to con object, the default action is nmcli
con list. Reference to D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>status Print status of active connections. Reference to
D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>up id &lt;id&gt; | uuid &lt;id&gt; [iface &lt;iface&gt;]
[ap &lt;hwaddr&gt;] [--nowait] [--timeout &lt;timeout&gt;]
Activate a connection. The connection is identified by its
name using id or UUID using uuid. For requiring par- ticular
device to activate the connection on, iface option with
interface name should be given. ap option can further
concretize what AP should be used in case of WiFi
connection. --nowait option causes nmcli to exit immediately
and not to wait for command completion. --timeout option
provides a means to specify how long to wait for operation
completion. Reference to D-Bus: interface:
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager method: ActivateConnection
arguments: according to arguments</p>

<p>down id &lt;id&gt; | uuid &lt;id&gt; Deactivate a
connection. The connection is identified by its name using
id or UUID using uuid. Reference to D-Bus: interface:
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager method: DeactivateConnection
arguments: according to arguments</p>

<p>dev Devices Get information about devices.</p>

<p>COMMAND := { status | list | disconnect | wifi }</p>

<p>status Print status of devices. This is the default
action, when no command is specified to dev object.
Reference to D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>list [iface &lt;iface&gt;] Get detailed information
about devices. Without an argu- ment, all devices are
examined. To get information for a specific device, iface
argument with the interface name should be provided.
Reference to D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>disconnect iface &lt;iface&gt; [--nowait] [--timeout
&lt;timeout&gt;] Disconnect a device and prevent the device
from automati- cally activating further connections without
user/manual intervention. --nowait option causes nmcli to
exit imme- diately and not to wait for command completion.
--time- out option provides a means to specify how long to
wait for operation completion. Reference to D-Bus:
interface: org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device method:
Disconnect arguments: none</p>

<p>wifi [list [iface &lt;iface&gt;] [hwaddr
&lt;hwaddr&gt;]] List available WiFi access points. iface
and hwaddr options can be used to get just APs for
particular inter- face or specific AP, respectively.
Reference to D-Bus: No simple reference.</p>

<p>BUGS There are probably some. If you find a bug, please
report to https://bugzilla.gnome.org/ - product
