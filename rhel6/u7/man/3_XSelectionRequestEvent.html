<p>XSelectionRequestEvent(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XSelectionRequestEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSelectionRequestEvent - SelectionRequest event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for SelectionRequest events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* SelectionRequest */
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window owner; Window requestor; Atom
selection; Atom target; Atom property; Time time; }
XSelectionRequestEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The owner member is set to the window that was specified
by the current owner in its XSetSelectionOwner call. The
requestor member is set to the window requesting the
selection. The selection member is set to the atom that
names the selection. For example, PRIMARY is used to
indicate the primary selection. The target member is set to
the atom that indicates the type the selection is desired
in. The property mem- ber can be a property name or None.
The time member is set to the timestamp or CurrentTime value
from the ConvertSelection request.</p>
