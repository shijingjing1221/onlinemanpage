<p>NAME smp_rep_general - invoke REPORT GENERAL SMP
function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smp_rep_general [--change_report] [--help]
[--hex] [--interface=PARAMS] [--raw] [--sa=SAS_ADDR]
[--verbose] [--version] SMP_DEVICE[,N]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SAS Management Protocol (SMP) REPORT
GENERAL request function to a SMP target. The SMP target is
identified by the SMP_DEVICE and the SAS_ADDR. Depending on
the interface, the SAS_ADDR may be deduced from the
SMP_DEVICE. With one interface there is one SMP_DEVICE per
machine so the SMP_DEVICE,N syntax is needed to
differentiate between HBAs if there are multiple
present.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options as well.</p>

<p>-c, --change_report reports (prints to stdout) the value
of the expander change count field from the response. The
value is printed in decimal and is obtained from a 16 bit
field.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --hex output the response in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>-I, --interface=PARAMS interface specific parameters. In
this case &quot;interface&quot; refers to the path through
the operating system to the SMP initiator. See the smp_utils
man page for more information.</p>

<p>-r, --raw send the response to stdout in binary. All
error messages are sent to stderr.</p>

<p>-s, --sa=SAS_ADDR specifies the SAS address of the SMP
target device. Typically this is an expander. This option
may not be needed if the SMP_DEVICE has the targets SAS
address within it. The SAS_ADDR is in decimal but most SAS
addresses are shown in hexadecimal. To give a number in
hexadecimal either prefix it with 0x or put a trailing h on
it.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the verbosity of the output. Can
be used multiple times</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The SMP REPORT GENERAL function was
introduced in SAS-1, with small additions in SAS-1.1 . There
have been a large number of additions in SAS-2 .</p>
