<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) A Tcl interpreter.
Most procedures use this only for returning error mes-
sages; if it is NULL then no error messages are returned.
For Tk_CreateOp- tionTable the value cannot be NULL; it
gives the interpreter in which the option table will be
used.</p>

<p>const Tk_OptionSpec *templatePtr (in) Points to an array
of static information that describes the configuration
options that are supported. Used to build a Tk_OptionTable.
The infor- mation pointed to by this argument must exist for
the lifetime of the Tk_OptionTable.</p>

<p>Tk_OptionTable optionTable (in) Token for an option
table. Must have been returned by a previous call to Tk_Cre-
ateOptionTable.</p>

<p>char *recordPtr (in/out) Points to structure in which
values of configura- tion options are stored; fields of this
record are modified by procedures such as Tk_SetOptions and
read by procedures such as Tk_GetOptionValue.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) For options such as
TK_OPTION_COLOR, this argu- ment indicates the window in
which the option will be used. If optionTable uses no
window-dependent options, then a NULL value may be supplied
for this argument.</p>

<p>int objc (in) Number of values in objv.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *const objv[] (in) Command-line arguments for
setting configuring options.</p>

<p>Tk_SavedOptions *savePtr (out) If not NULL, the
structure pointed to by this argument is filled in with the
old values of any options that were modified and old val-
ues are restored automati- cally if an error occurs in
Tk_SetOptions.</p>

<p>int *maskPtr (out) If not NULL, the word pointed to by
maskPtr is filled in with the bit-wise OR of the typeMask
fields for the options that were modified.</p>

<p>Tk_SavedOptions *savedPtr (in/out) Points to a structure
pre- viously filled in by Tk_SetOptions with old val- ues of
modified options.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *namePtr (in) The value of this object is the
name of a particular option. If NULL is passed to
Tk_GetOptionInfo then information is returned for all
options. Must not be NULL when Tk_GetOptionValue is
called.</p>

<p>type name type (in) The name of the type of a
record.</p>

<p>field name field (in) The name of a field in records of
type type.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures handle most of the details
of parsing configuration options such as those for Tk
widgets. Given a description of what options are supported,
these procedures handle all the details of pars- ing options
and storing their values into a C structure associated with
the widget or object. The procedures were designed primarily
for wid- gets in Tk, but they can also be used for other
kinds of objects that have configuration options. In the
rest of this manual page widget will be used to refer to the
object whose options are being managed; in practice the
object may not actually be a widget. The term widget record
is used to refer to the C-level structure in which
information about a particular widget or object is
stored.</p>

<p>Note: the easiest way to learn how to use these
procedures is to look at a working example. In Tk, the
simplest example is the code that implements the button
family of widgets, which is in tkButton.c. Other examples
are in tkSquare.c and tkMenu.c.</p>

<p>In order to use these procedures, the code that
implements the widget must contain a static array of
Tk_OptionSpec structures. This is a tem- plate that
describes the various options supported by that class of
widget; there is a separate template for each kind of
widget. The tem- plate contains information such as the name
of each option, its type, its default value, and where the
value of the option is stored in the widget record. See
TEMPLATES below for more detail.</p>

<p>In order to process configuration options efficiently,
the static tem- plate must be augmented with additional
information that is available only at runtime. The procedure
Tk_CreateOptionTable creates this dynamic information from
the template and returns a Tk_OptionTable token that
describes both the static and dynamic information. All of
the other procedures, such as Tk_SetOptions, take a
Tk_OptionTable token as argument. Typically,
Tk_CreateOptionTable is called the first time that a widget
of a particular class is created and the resulting
Tk_OptionTable is used in the future for all widgets of that
class. A Tk_OptionTable may be used only in a single
interpreter, given by the interp argument to
Tk_CreateOptionTable. When an option table is no longer
needed Tk_DeleteOptionTable should be called to free all of
its resources. All of the option tables for a Tcl
interpreter are freed automatically if the interpreter is
deleted.</p>

<p>Tk_InitOptions is invoked when a new widget is created
to set the default values for all of the widget s
configuration options. Tk_Ini- tOptions is passed a token
for an option table (optionTable) and a pointer to a widget
record (recordPtr), which is the C structure that holds
information about this widget. Tk_InitOptions uses the
informa- tion in the option table to choose an appropriate
default for each option, then it stores the default value
directly into the widget record, overwriting any information
that was already present in the widget record.
Tk_InitOptions normally returns TCL_OK. If an error occurred
while setting the default values (e.g., because a default
value was erroneous) then TCL_ERROR is returned and an error
message is left in interps result if interp is not NULL.</p>

<p>Tk_SetOptions is invoked to modify configuration options
based on information specified in a Tcl command. The command
might be one that creates a new widget, or a command that
modifies options on an existing widget. The objc and objv
arguments describe the values of the argu- ments from the
Tcl command. Objv must contain an even number of objects:
the first object of each pair gives the name of an option
and the second object gives the new value for that option.
Tk_SetOptions looks up each name in optionTable, checks that
the new value of the option conforms to the type in
optionTable, and stores the value of the option into the
widget record given by recordPtr. Tk_SetOptions nor- mally
returns TCL_OK. If an error occurred (such as an unknown
option name or an illegal option value) then TCL_ERROR is
returned and an error message is left in interps result if
interp is not NULL.</p>

<p>Tk_SetOptions has two additional features. First, if the
maskPtr argu- ment is not NULL then it points to an integer
value that is filled in with information about the options
that were modified. For each option in the template passed
to Tk_CreateOptionTable there is a typeMask field. The bits
of this field are defined by the code that implements the
widget; for example, each bit might correspond to a
particular con- figuration option. Alternatively, bits might
be used functionally. For example, one bit might be used for
redisplay: all options that affect the widgets display, such
that changing the option requires the widget to be
redisplayed, might have that bit set. Another bit might
indicate that the geometry of the widget must be recomputed,
and so on. Tk_SetOptions ORs together the typeMask fields
from all the options that were modified and returns this
value at *maskPtr; the caller can then use this information
to optimize itself so that, for example, it does not
redisplay the widget if the modified options do not affect
the widgets appearance.</p>

<p>The second additional feature of Tk_SetOptions has to do
with error recovery. If an error occurs while processing
configuration options, this feature makes it possible to
restore all the configuration options to their previous
values. Errors can occur either while processing options in
Tk_SetOptions or later in the caller. In many cases the
caller does additional processing after Tk_SetOptions
returns; for example, it might use an option value to set a
trace on a variable and may detect an error if the variable
is an array instead of a scalar. Error recovery is enabled
by passing in a non-NULL value for the savePtr argument to
Tk_SetOptions; this should be a pointer to an uninitialized
Tk_SavedOptions structure on the callers stack.
Tk_SetOptions overwrites the structure pointed to by savePtr
with information about the old values of any options
modified by the proce- dure. If Tk_SetOptions returns
successfully, the caller uses the structure in one of two
ways. If the caller completes its processing of the new
options without any errors, then it must pass the structure
to Tk_FreeSavedOptions so that the old values can be freed.
If the caller detects an error in its processing of the new
options, then it should pass the structure to
Tk_RestoreSavedOptions, which will copy the old values back
into the widget record and free the new values. If
Tk_SetOptions detects an error then it automatically
restores any options that had already been modified and
leaves *savePtr in an empty state: the caller need not call
either Tk_FreeSavedOptions or Tk_RestoreSavedOptions. If the
savePtr argument to Tk_SetOptions is NULL then Tk_SetOptions
frees each old option value immediately when it sets a new
value for the option. In this case, if an error occurs in
the third option, the old values for the first two options
cannot be restored.</p>

<p>Tk_GetOptionValue returns the current value of a
configuration option for a particular widget. The namePtr
argument contains the name of an option; Tk_GetOptionValue
uses optionTable to lookup the option and extract its value
from the widget record pointed to by recordPtr, then it
returns an object containing that value. If an error occurs
(e.g., because namePtr contains an unknown option name) then
NULL is returned and an error message is left in interps
result unless interp is NULL.</p>

<p>Tk_GetOptionInfo returns information about configuration
options in a form suitable for configure widget commands. If
the namePtr argument is not NULL, it points to an object
that gives the name of a configura- tion option;
Tk_GetOptionInfo returns an object containing a list with
five elements, which are the name of the option, the name
and class used for the option in the option database, the
default value for the option, and the current value for the
option. If the namePtr argument is NULL, then
Tk_GetOptionInfo returns information about all options in
the form of a list of lists; each sublist describes one
option. Syn- onym options are handled differently depending
on whether namePtr is NULL: if namePtr is NULL then the
sublist for each synonym option has only two elements, which
are the name of the option and the name of the other option
that it refers to; if namePtr is non-NULL and names a syn-
onym option then the object returned is the five-element
list for the other option that the synonym refers to. If an
error occurs (e.g., because namePtr contains an unknown
option name) then NULL is returned and an error message is
left in interp s result unless interp is NULL.</p>

<p>Tk_FreeConfigOptions must be invoked when a widget is
deleted. It frees all of the resources associated with any
of the configuration options defined in recordPtr by
optionTable.</p>

<p>The Tk_Offset macro is provided as a safe way of
generating the objOff- set and internalOffset values for
entries in Tk_OptionSpec structures. It takes two arguments:
the name of a type of record, and the name of a field in
that record. It returns the byte offset of the named field
in records of the given type.</p>

<p>TEMPLATES The array of Tk_OptionSpec structures passed
to Tk_CreateOptionTable via its templatePtr argument
describes the configuration options sup- ported by a
particular class of widgets. Each structure specifies one
configuration option and has the following fields: typedef
struct { Tk_OptionType type; const char *optionName; const
char *dbName; const char *dbClass; const char *defValue; int
objOffset; int internalOffset; int flags; ClientData
clientData; int typeMask; } Tk_OptionSpec; The type field
indicates what kind of configuration option this is (e.g.
TK_OPTION_COLOR for a color value, or TK_OPTION_INT for an
inte- ger value). Type determines how the value of the
option is parsed (more on this below). The optionName field
is a string such as -font or -bg; it is the name used for
the option in Tcl commands and passed to procedures via the
objc or namePtr arguments. The dbName and dbClass fields are
used by Tk_InitOptions to look up a default value for this
option in the option database; if dbName is NULL then the
option database is not used by Tk_InitOptions for this
option. The defValue field specifies a default value for
this configuration option if no value is specified in the
option database. The objOffset and internalOffset fields
indicate where to store the value of this option in widget
records (more on this below); values for the objOffset and
internalOffset fields should always be generated with the
Tk_Offset macro. The flags field contains additional
information to control the processing of this configuration
option (see below for details). ClientData provides
additional type-specific data needed by certain types. For
instance, for TK_OPTION_COLOR types, clientData is a string
giving the default value to use on monochrome displays. See
the descriptions of the different types below for details.
The last field, typeMask, is used by Tk_SetOptions to return
information about which options were modified; see the
description of Tk_SetOptions above for details.</p>

<p>When Tk_InitOptions and Tk_SetOptions store the value of
an option into the widget record, they can do it in either
of two ways. If the objOffset field of the Tk_OptionSpec is
greater than or equal to zero, then the value of the option
is stored as a (Tcl_Obj *) at the location in the widget
record given by objOffset. If the internalOffset field of
the Tk_OptionSpec is greater than or equal to zero, then the
value of the option is stored in a type-specific internal
form at the loca- tion in the widget record given by
internalOffset. For example, if the options type is
TK_OPTION_INT then the internal form is an integer. If the
objOffset or internalOffset field is negative then the value
is not stored in that form. At least one of the offsets must
be greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p>The flags field consists of one or more bits ORed
together. At present only a single flag is supported:
TK_OPTION_NULL_OK. If this bit is set for an option then an
empty string will be accepted as the value for the option
and the resulting internal form will be a NULL pointer, a
zero value, or None, depending on the type of the option. If
the flag is not set then empty strings will result in
errors. TK_OPTION_NULL_OK is typically used to allow a
feature to be turned off entirely, e.g. set a cursor value
to None so that a window simply inherits its par- ent s
cursor. Not all option types support the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK
flag; for those that do, there is an explicit indication of
that fact in the descriptions below.</p>

<p>The type field of each Tk_OptionSpec structure
determines how to parse the value of that configuration
option. The legal value for type, and the corresponding
actions, are described below. If the type requires a tkwin
value to be passed into procedures like Tk_SetOptions, or if
it uses the clientData field of the Tk_OptionSpec, then it
is indicated explicitly; if not mentioned, the type requires
neither tkwin nor clientData.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_ANCHOR The value must be a standard anchor
position such as ne or cen- ter. The internal form is a
Tk_Anchor value like the ones returned by
Tk_GetAnchorFromObj.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_BITMAP The value must be a standard Tk bitmap
name. The internal form is a Pixmap token like the ones
returned by Tk_AllocBitmapFro- mObj. This option type
requires tkwin to be supplied to proce- dures such as
Tk_SetOptions, and it supports the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK
flag.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_BOOLEAN The value must be a standard boolean
value such as true or no. The internal form is an integer
with value 0 or 1.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_BORDER The value must be a standard color name
such as red or #ff8080. The internal form is a Tk_3DBorder
token like the ones returned by Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj.
This option type requires tkwin to be supplied to procedures
such as Tk_SetOptions, and it supports the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK
flag.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_COLOR The value must be a standard color name
such as red or #ff8080. The internal form is an (XColor *)
token like the ones returned by Tk_AllocColorFromObj. This
option type requires tkwin to be supplied to procedures such
as Tk_SetOptions, and it supports the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK
flag.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_CURSOR The value must be a standard cursor
name such as cross or @foo. The internal form is a Tk_Cursor
token like the ones returned by Tk_AllocCursorFromObj. This
option type requires tkwin to be supplied to procedures such
as Tk_SetOptions, and when the option is set the cursor for
the window is changed by calling XDefineCursor. This option
type also supports the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK flag.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_CUSTOM This option allows applications to
define new option types. The clientData field of the entry
points to a structure defining the new option type. See the
section CUSTOM OPTION TYPES below for details.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_DOUBLE The string value must be a
floating-point number in the format accepted by strtol. The
internal form is a C double value. This option type supports
the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK flag; if a NULL value is set, the
internal representation is set to zero.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_END Marks the end of the template. There must
be a Tk_OptionSpec structure with type TK_OPTION_END at the
end of each template. If the clientData field of this
structure is not NULL, then it points to an additional array
of Tk_OptionSpec s, which is itself terminated by another
TK_OPTION_END entry. Templates may be chained arbitrarily
deeply. This feature allows common options to be shared by
several widget classes.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_FONT The value must be a standard font name
such as Times 16. The internal form is a Tk_Font handle like
the ones returned by Tk_AllocFontFromObj. This option type
requires tkwin to be sup- plied to procedures such as
Tk_SetOptions, and it supports the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK
flag.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_INT The string value must be an integer in the
format accepted by strtol (e.g. 0 and 0x prefixes may be
used to specify octal or hexadecimal numbers, respectively).
The internal form is a C int value.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_JUSTIFY The value must be a standard
justification value such as left. The internal form is a
Tk_Justify like the values returned by
Tk_GetJustifyFromObj.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_PIXELS The value must specify a screen
distance such as 2i or 6.4. The internal form is an integer
value giving a distance in pixels, like the values returned
by Tk_GetPixelsFromObj. Note: if the objOffset field is not
used then information about the original value of this
option will be lost. See OBJOFFSET VS. INTER- NALOFFSET
below for details. This option type supports the
TK_OPTION_NULL_OK flag; if a NULL value is set, the internal
representation is set to zero.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_RELIEF The value must be standard relief such
as raised. The internal form is an integer relief value such
as TK_RELIEF_RAISED. This option type supports the
TK_OPTION_NULL_OK flag; if the empty string is specified as
the value for the option, the integer relief value is set to
TK_RELIEF_NULL.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_STRING The value may be any string. The
internal form is a (char *) pointer that points to a
dynamically allocated copy of the value. This option type
supports the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK flag.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_STRING_TABLE For this type, clientData is a
pointer to an array of strings suitable for passing to
Tcl_GetIndexFromObj. The value must be one of the strings in
the table, or a unique abbreviation of one of the strings.
The internal form is an integer giving the index into the
table of the matching string, like the return value from
Tcl_GetStringFromObj.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_SYNONYM This type is used to provide
alternative names for an option (for example, -bg is often
used as a synonym for -background). The clientData field is
a (char *) pointer that gives the name of another option in
the same table. Whenever the synonym option is used, the
information from the other option will be used instead.</p>

<p>TK_OPTION_WINDOW The value must be a window path name.
The internal form is a Tk_Window token for the window. This
option type requires tkwin to be supplied to procedures such
as Tk_SetOptions (in order to identify the application), and
it supports the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK flag.</p>

<p>STORAGE MANAGEMENT ISSUES If a field of a widget record
has its offset stored in the objOffset or internalOffset
field of a Tk_OptionSpec structure then the procedures
described here will handle all of the storage allocation and
resource management issues associated with the field. When
the value of an option is changed, Tk_SetOptions (or
Tk_FreeSavedOptions) will automat- ically free any resources
associated with the old value, such as Tk_Fonts for
TK_OPTION_FONT options or dynamically allocated memory for
TK_OPTION_STRING options. For an option stored as an object
using the objOffset field of a Tk_OptionSpec, the widget
record shares the object pointed to by the objv value from
the call to Tk_SetOptions. The ref- erence count for this
object is incremented when a pointer to it is stored in the
widget record and decremented when the option is modi- fied.
When the widget is deleted Tk_FreeConfigOptions should be
invoked; it will free the resources associated with all
options and decrement reference counts for any objects.</p>

<p>However, the widget code is responsible for storing NULL
or None in all pointer and token fields before invoking
Tk_InitOptions. This is needed to allow proper cleanup in
the rare case where an error occurs in Tk_InitOptions.</p>

<p>OBJOFFSET VS. INTERNALOFFSET In most cases it is
simplest to use the internalOffset field of a Tk_OptionSpec
structure and not the objOffset field. This makes the
internal form of the value immediately available to the
widget code so the value does not have to be extracted from
an object each time it is used. However, there are two cases
where the objOffset field is use- ful. The first case is for
TK_OPTION_PIXELS options. In this case, the internal form is
an integer pixel value that is valid only for a particular
screen. If the value of the option is retrieved, it will be
returned as a simple number. For example, after the command
.b config- ure -borderwidth 2m, the command .b configure
-borderwidth might return 7, which is the integer pixel
value corresponding to 2m. Unfortu- nately, this loses the
original screen-independent value. Thus for TK_OPTION_PIXELS
options it is better to use the objOffset field. In this
case the original value of the option is retained in the
object and can be returned when the option is retrieved. In
most cases it is convenient to use the internalOffset field
as well, so that the integer value is immediately available
for use in the widget code (alterna- tively,
Tk_GetPixelsFromObj can be used to extract the integer value
from the object whenever it is needed). Note: the problem of
losing information on retrievals exists only for
TK_OPTION_PIXELS options.</p>

<p>The second reason to use the objOffset field is in order
to implement new types of options not supported by these
procedures. To implement a new type of option, you can use
TK_OPTION_STRING as the type in the Tk_OptionSpec structure
and set the objOffset field but not the inter- nalOffset
field. Then, after calling Tk_SetOptions, convert the object
to internal form yourself.</p>

<p>CUSTOM OPTION TYPES Applications can extend the built-in
configuration types with addi- tional configuration types by
writing procedures to parse, print, free, and restore saved
copies of the type and creating a structure pointing to
those procedures: typedef struct Tk_ObjCustomOption { char
*name; Tk_CustomOptionSetProc *setProc;
Tk_CustomOptionGetProc *getProc; Tk_CustomOptionRestoreProc
*restoreProc; Tk_CustomOptionFreeProc *freeProc; ClientData
clientData; } Tk_ObjCustomOption;</p>

<p>typedef int Tk_CustomOptionSetProc( ClientData
clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp, Tk_Window tkwin, Tcl_Obj
**valuePtr, char *recordPtr, int internalOffset, char
*saveInternalPtr, int flags);</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_Obj *Tk_CustomOptionGetProc( ClientData
clientData, Tk_Window tkwin, char *recordPtr, int
internalOffset);</p>

<p>typedef void Tk_CustomOptionRestoreProc( ClientData
clientData, Tk_Window tkwin, char *internalPtr, char
*saveInternalPtr);</p>

<p>typedef void Tk_CustomOptionFreeProc( ClientData
clientData, Tk_Window tkwin, char *internalPtr);</p>

<p>The Tk_ObjCustomOption structure contains six fields: a
name for the custom option type; pointers to the four
procedures; and a clientData value to be passed to those
procedures when they are invoked. The clientData value
typically points to a structure containing information that
is needed by the procedures when they are parsing and
printing options. RestoreProc and freeProc may be NULL,
indicating that no function should be called for those
operations.</p>

<p>The setProc procedure is invoked by Tk_SetOptions to
convert a Tcl_Obj into an internal representation and store
the resulting value in the widget record. The arguments
are:</p>

<p>clientData A copy of the clientData field in the
Tk_ObjCustomOption structure.</p>

<p>interp A pointer to a Tcl interpreter, used for error
reporting.</p>

<p>Tkwin A copy of the tkwin argument to Tk_SetOptions</p>

<p>valuePtr A pointer to a reference to a Tcl_Obj
describing the new value for the option; it could have been
specified explicitly in the call to Tk_SetOptions or it
could come from the option database or a default. If the
objOffset for the option is non-negative (the option value
is stored as a (Tcl_Obj *) in the widget record), the
Tcl_Obj pointer referenced by valuePtr is the pointer that
will be stored at the objOffset for the option. SetProc may
modify the value if necessary; for example, setProc may
change the value to NULL to support the TK_OPTION_NULL_OK
flag.</p>

<p>recordPtr A pointer to the start of the widget record to
modify.</p>

<p>internalOffset Offset in bytes from the start of the
widget record to the location where the internal
representation of the option value is to be placed.</p>

<p>saveInternalPtr A pointer to storage allocated in a
Tk_SavedOptions structure for the internal representation of
the original option value. Before setting the option to its
new value, setProc should set the value referenced by
saveIn- ternalPtr to the original value of the option in
order to support Tk_RestoreSavedOptions.</p>

<p>flags A copy of the flags field in the Tk_OptionSpec
structure for the option</p>

<p>SetProc returns a standard Tcl result: TCL_OK to
indicate successful processing, or TCL_ERROR to indicate a
failure of any kind. An error message may be left in the Tcl
interpreter given by interp in the case of an error.</p>

<p>The getProc procedure is invoked by Tk_GetOptionValue
and Tk_GetOption- Info to retrieve a Tcl_Obj representation
of the internal representa- tion of an option. The
clientData argument is a copy of the clientData field in the
Tk_ObjCustomOption structure. Tkwin is a copy of the tkwin
argument to Tk_GetOptionValue or Tk_GetOptionInfo. RecordPtr
is a pointer to the beginning of the widget record to query.
InternalOff- set is the offset in bytes from the beginning
of the widget record to the location where the internal
representation of the option value is stored. GetProc must
return a pointer to a Tcl_Obj representing the value of the
option.</p>

<p>The restoreProc procedure is invoked by
Tk_RestoreSavedOptions to restore a previously saved
internal representation of a custom option value. The
clientData argument is a copy of the clientData field in the
Tk_ObjCustomOption structure. Tkwin is a copy of the tkwin
argu- ment to Tk_GetOptionValue or Tk_GetOptionInfo.
InternalPtr is a pointer to the location where internal
representation of the option value is stored.
SaveInternalPtr is a pointer to the saved value. RestoreProc
must copy the value from saveInternalPtr to internalPtr to
restore the value. RestoreProc need not free any memory
associated with either internalPtr or saveInternalPtr;
freeProc will be invoked to free that memory if necessary.
RestoreProc has no return value.</p>

<p>The freeProc procedure is invoked by Tk_SetOptions and
Tk_FreeSavedOp- tions to free any storage allocated for the
internal representation of a custom option. The clientData
argument is a copy of the clientData field in the
