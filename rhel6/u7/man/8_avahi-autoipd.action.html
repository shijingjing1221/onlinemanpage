<p>NAME avahi-autoipd.action - avahi-autoipd action
script</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/avahi/avahi-autoipd.action</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION avahi-autoipd.action is the action script
that is called whenever an IP address has been acquired by
avahi-autoipd or when it detected an IP address conflict.
The script should add or remove the specified address from
the specified network interface.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS argv[1] An event string: one of BIND,
CONFLICT, UNBIND or STOP. If BIND is passed an IP address
has been sucessfully acquired and the script shall add it to
the network interface. If CONFLICT is passed avahi- autopid
detected a IP address on the local network, the action
script should remove the configured IP address. If UNBIND is
passed the IP address should be removed from the interface,
too, because a routable address has been configured to the
interface by some other program. If STOP is passed the
avahi-autoipd is being shutdown and the action script should
remove the IP address. In short: on BIND the address should
be added to the interface, on CONFLICT, UNBIND or STOP it
should be removed.</p>

<p>argv[2] The network interface name.</p>

<p>argv[3] An IP address from the IPv4LL range.</p>
