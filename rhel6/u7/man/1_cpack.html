<p>NAME cpack - Packaging driver provided by CMake.</p>

<p>USAGE cpack -G &lt;generator&gt; [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;cpack&quot; executable is the
CMake packaging program. CMake-generated build trees created
for projects that use the INSTALL_* commands have packaging
support. This program will generate the package.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -G &lt;generator&gt; Use the specified generator
to generate package.</p>

<p>CPack may support multiple native packaging systems on
certain platforms. A generator is responsible for generating
input files for particular system and invoking that systems.
Possible gener- ator names are specified in the Generators
section.</p>

<p>-C &lt;Configuration&gt; Specify the project
configuration</p>

<p>This option specifies the configuration that the project
was build with, for example Debug, Release.</p>

<p>-D &lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt; Set a CPack variable.</p>

<p>Set a variable that can be used by the generator.</p>

<p>--config &lt;config file&gt; Specify the config
file.</p>

<p>Specify the config file to use to create the package. By
default CPackConfig.cmake in the current directory will be
used.</p>

<p>--verbose,-V enable verbose output</p>

<p>Run cpack with verbose output.</p>

<p>--debug enable debug output (for CPack developers)</p>

<p>Run cpack with debug output (for CPack developers).</p>

<p>-P &lt;package name&gt; override/define
CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</p>

<p>If the package name is not specified on cpack commmand
line thenCPack.cmake defines it as CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME</p>

<p>-R &lt;package version&gt; override/define
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION</p>

<p>If version is not specified on cpack command line thenC-
Pack.cmake defines it from CPACK_PACKAGE_VER-
SION_[MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH]look into CPack.cmake for detail</p>

<p>-B &lt;package directory&gt; override/define
CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY</p>

<p>The directory where CPack will be doing its packaging
work.The resulting package will be found there. Inside this
directoryC- Pack creates _CPack_Packages sub-directory which
is theCPack temporary directory.</p>

<p>--vendor &lt;vendor name&gt; override/define
CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR</p>

<p>If vendor is not specified on cpack command line (or
inside CMakeLists.txt) thenCPack.cmake defines it with a
default value</p>

<p>COMMANDS cpack_add_component Describes a CPack
installation component named by the COMPONENT argument to a
CMake INSTALL command.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component(compname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
[GROUP group] [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ] [INSTALL_TYPES
type1 type2 ... ] [DOWNLOADED] [ARCHIVE_FILE filename])</p>

<p>The cmake_add_component command describes an
installation compo- nent, which the user can opt to install
or remove as part of the graphical installation process.
compname is the name of the com- ponent, as provided to the
COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
commands.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component,
used in graphical installers to display the component name.
This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component,
used in graphical installers to give the user additional
information about the component. Descriptions can span
multiple lines using &quot;0 as the line separator.
Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a few
lines long.</p>

<p>HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in
the graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly
change whether it is installed or not.</p>

<p>REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and
therefore will always be installed. It will be visible in
the graphical installer, but it cannot be unselected.
(Typically, required components are shown greyed out).</p>

<p>DISABLED indicates that this component should be
disabled (unse- lected) by default. The user is free to
select this component for installation, unless it is also
HIDDEN.</p>

<p>DEPENDS lists the components on which this component
depends. If this component is selected, then each of the
components listed must also be selected. The dependency
information is encoded within the installer itself, so that
users cannot install incon- sistent sets of components.</p>

<p>GROUP names the component group of which this component
is a part. If not provided, the component will be a
standalone compo- nent, not part of any component group.
Component groups are described with the
cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.</p>

<p>INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this
compo- nent is a part. When one of these installations types
is selected, this component will automatically be selected.
Instal- lation types are described with the
cpack_add_install_type com- mand, detailed below.</p>

<p>DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be
downloaded on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged
in with the installer itself. For more information, see the
cpack_config- ure_downloads command.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file
created by CPack to be used for downloaded components. If
not supplied, CPack will create a file with some name based
on CPACK_PACK- AGE_FILE_NAME and the name of the component.
See cpack_config- ure_downloads for more information.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group Describes a group of related
CPack installation components.</p>

<p>cpack_add_component_group(groupname [DISPLAY_NAME name]
[DESCRIPTION description] [PARENT_GROUP parent] [EXPANDED]
[BOLD_TITLE])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of
installation components, which will be placed together
within the listing of options. Typically, component groups
allow the user to select/deselect all of the components
within a single group via a single group-level option. Use
component groups to reduce the complexity of installers with
many options. groupname is an arbitrary name used to
identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a
component in a group. The name of the group must not
conflict with the name of any component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component
group, used in graphical installers to display the component
group name. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component
group, used in graphical installers to give the user
additional infor- mation about the components within that
group. Descriptions can span multiple lines using &quot;0 as
the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be
no more than a few lines long.</p>

<p>PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of
this group. Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy
of groups, pro- viding an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.</p>

<p>EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should
show up as &quot;expanded&quot;, so that the user
immediately sees all of the compo- nents within the group.
Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a single
entry.</p>

<p>BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear
in bold, to call the users attention to the group.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type Add a new installation type
containing a set of predefined com- ponent selections to the
graphical installer.</p>

<p>cpack_add_install_type(typename [DISPLAY_NAME name])</p>

<p>The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of
prese- lected components that represents a common use case
for an application. For example, a &quot;Developer&quot;
install type might include an application along with its
header and library files, while an &quot;End user&quot;
install type might just include the applica- tion s
executable. Each component identifies itself with one or
more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to
cpack_add_component.</p>

<p>DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type,
which will typically show up in a drop-down box within a
graphical installer. This value can be any string.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads Configure CPack to download
selected components on-the-fly as part of the installation
process.</p>

<p>cpack_configure_downloads(site [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY
dirname] [ALL] [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])</p>

<p>The cpack_configure_downloads command configures
installa- tion-time downloads of selected components. For
each download- able component, CPack will create an archive
containing the contents of that component, which should be
uploaded to the given site. When the user selects that
component for installa- tion, the installer will download
and extract the component in place. This feature is useful
for creating small installers that only download the
requested components, saving bandwidth. Addi- tionally, the
installers are small enough that they will be installed as
part of the normal installation process, and the
&quot;Change&quot; button in Windows Add/Remove Programs
control panel will allow one to add or remove parts of the
application after the original installation. On Windows, the
downloaded-components functionality requires the ZipDLL
plug-in for NSIS, available at:</p>

<p>http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in</p>

<p>On Mac OS X, installers that download components
on-the-fly can only be built and installed on system using
Mac OS X 10.5 or later.</p>

<p>The site argument is a URL where the archives for
downloadable components will reside, e.g.,
http://www.cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the
archives produced by CPack should be uploaded to that
location.</p>

<p>UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will
create the various archives for each of the components. The
contents of this directory should be uploaded to a location
accessible by the URL given in the site argument. If
omitted, CPack will use the directory CPackUploads inside
the CMake binary directory to store the generated
archives.</p>

<p>The ALL flag indicates that all components be
downloaded. Other- wise, only those components explicitly
marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a specified ARCHIVE_FILE
will be downloaded. Addition- ally, the ALL option implies
ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).</p>

<p>ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of
the installer that can be called from Windows Add/Remove
Programs dialog (via the &quot;Modify&quot; button) to
change the set of installed components. NO_ADD_REMOVE turns
off this behavior. This option is ignored on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>break Break from an enclosing foreach or while loop.</p>

<p>break()</p>

<p>Breaks from an enclosing foreach loop or while loop</p>

<p>cmake_host_system_information Query host system specific
information.</p>

<p>cmake_host_system_information(RESULT &lt;variable&gt;
QUERY &lt;key&gt; ...)</p>

<p>Queries system information of the host system on which
cmake runs. One or more &lt;key&gt; can be provided to
select the informa- tion to be queried. The list of queried
values is stored in &lt;variable&gt;.</p>

<p>&lt;key&gt; can be one of the following values:</p>

<p>NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES = Number of logical cores.
NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES = Number of physical cores.
HOSTNAME = Hostname. FQDN = Fully qualified domain name.
TOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY = Total virtual memory in megabytes.
AVAILABLE_VIRTUAL_MEMORY = Available virtual memory in
megabytes. TOTAL_PHYSICAL_MEMORY = Total physical memory in
megabytes. AVAILABLE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY = Available physical
memory in megabytes.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required Set the minimum required version
of cmake for a project.</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] [FATAL_ERROR])</p>

<p>If the current version of CMake is lower than that
required it will stop processing the project and report an
error. When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the
command implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]])</p>

<p>which sets the cmake policy version level to the version
speci- fied. When version 2.4 or lower is given the command
implicitly invokes</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)</p>

<p>which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and
lower.</p>

<p>The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake
2.6 and higher. It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4
and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.</p>

<p>cmake_policy Manage CMake Policy settings.</p>

<p>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change
existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve
implementations of existing features. The CMake Policy
mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in
behavior. Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an
identifier of the form &quot;CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; where
&quot;&lt;NNNN&gt;&quot; is an integer index. Documentation
associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW
behavior and the reason the policy was introduced. Projects
may set each policy to select the desired behavior. When
CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a
setting specified by the project. If no setting is available
the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced
requesting that the policy be set.</p>

<p>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD
or NEW behavior. While setting policies individually is
supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on
CMake versions.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])</p>

<p>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for
the given version of CMake. All policies introduced in the
speci- fied version or earlier will be set to use NEW
behavior. All policies introduced after the specified
version will be unset (unless variable
CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default). This
effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake
version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their
new policies. The policy version specified must be at least
2.4 or the command will report an error. In order to get
compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4
see documentation of policy CMP0001.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW) cmake_policy(SET
CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)</p>

<p>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given
policy. Projects depending on the old behavior of a given
policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy
state to OLD. Alternatively one may fix the project to work
with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.</p>

<p>cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW
behavior. The output variable value will be &quot;OLD&quot;
or &quot;NEW&quot; if the policy is set, and empty
otherwise.</p>

<p>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made
by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the
stack. A new entry on the policy stack is managed
automatically for each sub- directory to protect its parents
and siblings. CMake also man- ages a new entry for scripts
loaded by include() and find_pack- age() commands except
when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also
policy CMP0011). The cmake_policy command pro- vides an
interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(PUSH) cmake_policy(POP)</p>

<p>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy
settings.</p>

<p>Functions and macros record policy settings when they
are cre- ated and use the pre-record policies when they are
invoked. If the function or macro implementation sets
policies, the changes automatically propagate up through
callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack
entry.</p>

<p>configure_file Copy a file to another location and
modify its contents.</p>

<p>configure_file(&lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt; [COPYONLY]
[ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY] [NEWLINE_STYLE
[UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])</p>

<p>Copies a file &lt;input&gt; to file &lt;output&gt; and
substitutes variable values referenced in the file content.
If &lt;input&gt; is a relative path it is evaluated with
respect to the current source direc- tory. The &lt;input&gt;
must be a file, not a directory. If &lt;output&gt; is a
relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current
binary directory. If &lt;output&gt; names an existing
directory the input file is placed in that directory with
its original name.</p>

<p>If the &lt;input&gt; file is modified the build system
will re-run CMake to re-configure the file and generate the
build system again.</p>

<p>This command replaces any variables in the input file
referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as
determined by CMake. If a variable is not defined, it will
be replaced with nothing. If COPYONLY is specified, then no
variable expansion will take place. If ESCAPE_QUOTES is
specified then any substituted quotes will be C-style
escaped. The file will be configured with the current values
of CMake variables. If @ONLY is speci- fied, only variables
of the form @VAR@ will be replaced and ${VAR} will be
ignored. This is useful for configuring scripts that use
${VAR}.</p>

<p>Input file lines of the form &quot;#cmakedefine VAR
...&quot; will be replaced with either &quot;#define VAR
...&quot; or &quot;/* #undef VAR */&quot; depending on
whether VAR is set in CMake to any value not con- sidered a
false constant by the if() command. (Content of
&quot;...&quot;, if any, is processed as above.) Input file
lines of the form &quot;#cmakedefine01 VAR&quot; will be
replaced with either &quot;#define VAR 1&quot; or
&quot;#define VAR 0&quot; similarly.</p>

<p>With NEWLINE_STYLE the line ending could be
adjusted:</p>

<p>0 UNIX or LF for 0 DOS, WIN32 or CRLF for</p>

<p>COPYONLY must not be used with NEWLINE_STYLE.</p>

<p>else Starts the else portion of an if block.</p>

<p>else(expression)</p>

<p>See the if command.</p>

<p>elseif Starts the elseif portion of an if block.</p>

[ERROR_FILE &lt;file&gt;] [OUTPUT_QUIET] [ERROR_QUIET]
[OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
[ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE])</p>

<p>Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the
stan- dard output of each process piped to the standard
input of the next. A single standard error pipe is used for
all processes. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named
directory will be set as the current working directory of
the child processes. If TIME- OUT is given the child
processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the
specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed). If
RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain
the result of running the processes. This will be an integer
return code from the last child or a string describing an
error condition. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are
given the variable named will be set with the contents of
the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.
If the same variable is named for both pipes their output
will be merged in the order produced. If INPUT_FILE,
OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be
attached to the stan- dard input of the first process,
standard output of the last process, or standard error of
all processes respectively. If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET
is given then the standard output or standard error results
will be quietly ignored. If more than one OUTPUT_* or
ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is
not specified. If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given
the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of
the CMake process itself.</p>

<p>The execute_process command is a newer more powerful
version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept
for compatibil- ity.</p>

<p>file File manipulation command.</p>

<p>WRITE will write a message into a file called filename.
It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the
file if it does not exist. (If the file is a build input,
use config- ure_file to update the file only when its
content changes.)</p>

<p>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE,
except it will append it to the end of the file</p>

<p>READ will read the content of a file and store it into
the vari- able. It will start at the given offset and read
up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary
data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and
this will be stored in the variable.</p>

<p>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will
compute a cryptographic hash of the content of a file.</p>

<p>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file
and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are
ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It
works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which
are automatically converted to binary format when reading
them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.</p>

<p>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to
return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read
from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of
bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets
the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings
are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a
string to return. Longer strings are split into strings no
longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows
newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating
them.</p>

<p>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must
match to be returned. Typical usage</p>

<p>file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)</p>

<p>stores a list in the variable &quot;myfile&quot; in
which each item is a line from the input file.</p>

<p>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the
globbing expressions and store it into the variable.
Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but
much simpler. If RELA- TIVE flag is specified for an
expression, the results will be returned as a relative path
to the given path. (We do not rec- ommend using GLOB to
collect a list of source files from your source tree. If no
CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or
removed then the generated build system cannot know when to
ask CMake to regenerate.)</p>

<p>Examples of globbing expressions include:</p>

<p>*.cxx - match all files with extension cxx *.vt? - match
all files with extension vta,...,vtz f[3-5].txt - match
files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt</p>

<p>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular
GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that
are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given
or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake
--help-policy CMP0009 for more information.</p>

<p>Examples of recursive globbing include:</p>

<p>/dir/*.py - match all python files in /dir and
subdirectories</p>

<p>MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also
if their parent directories dont exist yet</p>

<p>RENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem,
replacing the destination atomically.</p>

<p>REMOVE will remove the given files, also in
subdirectories</p>

<p>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and
directories, also non-empty directories</p>

<p>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from
directory to the given file.</p>

<p>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path
with unix /. The input can be a single path or a system path
like &quot;$ENV{PATH}&quot;. Note the double quotes around
the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes one argument. This
command will also convert the native list delimiters for a
list of paths like the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will
convert from a cmake style path into the native path style
for win- dows and / for UNIX.</p>

<p>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file.
If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in
var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation
will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of
length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for
the operation, and the second element is a string value for
the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the
operation. If TIMEOUT time is speci- fied, the operation
will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as
an integer. The INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer
number of seconds of inactivity after which the opera- tion
should terminate. If EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=value is specified,
the operation will verify that the downloaded files actual
hash matches the expected value, where ALGO is one of MD5,
SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512. If it does not
match, the operation fails with an error.
(&quot;EXPECTED_MD5 sum&quot; is short-hand for
&quot;EXPECTED_HASH MD5=sum&quot;.) If SHOW_PROGRESS is
specified, progress information will be printed as status
messages until the operation is complete. For https URLs
CMake must be built with OpenSSL. TLS/SSL certificates are
not checked by default. Set TLS_VERIFY to ON to check
certificates and/or use EXPECTED_HASH to verify downloaded
content. Set TLS_CAINFO to specify a custom Certificate
Authority file. If either TLS option is not given CMake will
check variables CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY and CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO,
respectively.</p>

<p>UPLOAD will upload the given file to the given URL. If
LOG var is specified a log of the upload will be put in var.
If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will
be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2.
The first element is the numeric return value for the
operation, and the second element is a string value for the
error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If
TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after
time seconds, time should be speci- fied as an integer. The
INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT specifies an integer number of seconds of
inactivity after which the operation should terminate. If
SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be
printed as status messages until the operation is com-
plete.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the
modification time of filename to variable.</p>

<p>Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp
variable will be set to the empty string &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>See documentation of the string TIMESTAMP sub-command
for more details.</p>

<p>The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL
signatures:</p>

<p>file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION
&lt;dir&gt; [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
[NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
[FILES_MATCHING] [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX
&lt;regex&gt;] [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]]
[...])</p>

<p>The COPY signature copies files, directories, and
symlinks to a destination folder. Relative input paths are
evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and
a relative destina- tion is evaluated with respect to the
current build directory. Copying preserves input file
timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the
destination with the same timestamp. Copying preserves input
permissions unless explicit permissions or
NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PER-
MISSIONS). See the install(DIRECTORY) command for
documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE
options.</p>

<p>The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it
prints sta- tus messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is
default. Installa- tion scripts generated by the install()
command use this signa- ture (with some undocumented options
for internal use).</p>

<p>GENERATE will write an &lt;output_file&gt; with content
from an &lt;input_file&gt;, or from &lt;input_content&gt;.
The output is generated conditionally based on the content
of the &lt;condition&gt;. The file is written at CMake
generate-time and the input may contain gen- erator
expressions. The &lt;condition&gt;, &lt;output_file&gt; and
&lt;input_file&gt; may also contain generator expressions.
The &lt;con- dition&gt; must evaluate to either 0 or 1. The
&lt;output_file&gt; must evaluate to a unique name among all
configurations and among all invocations of
file(GENERATE).</p>

<p>find_file Find the full path to a file.</p>

<p>find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_file( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a full path to named file.
A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the
result of this com- mand. If the full path to a file is
found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_file is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
loca- tions can be specified after the PATHS argument. If
ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the
environment variable var will be read and converted from a
system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.
For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdirectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_file(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>find_library Find a library.</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_library( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[NAMES_PER_DIR] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS
path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2
...]] [DOC &quot;cache documentation string&quot;]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH] [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH | NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a library. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the library is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_library is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the library that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH LIB</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and &lt;prefix&gt;/lib
for each &lt;prefix&gt; in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_library(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When more than one value is given to the NAMES option
this com- mand by default will consider one name at a time
and search every directory for it. The NAMES_PER_DIR option
tells this command to consider one directory at a time and
search for all names in it.</p>

<p>If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be
set to the full path to the framework
&lt;fullPath&gt;/A.framework. When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a -framework
A, and a -F&lt;fullPath&gt; to link the framework to the
target.</p>

<p>If the global property FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is
set all search paths will be tested as normal, with
&quot;64/&quot; appended, and with all matches of
&quot;lib/&quot; replaced with &quot;lib64/&quot;. This
property is automatically set for the platforms that are
known to need it if at least one of the languages supported
by the PROJECT com- mand is enabled.</p>

<p>find_package Load settings for an external project.</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[MODULE] [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
[OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Finds and loads settings from an external project.
&lt;pack- age&gt;_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the
package was found. When the package is found
package-specific information is provided through variables
and imported targets documented by the package itself. The
QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be
found. The MODULE option disables the second signature
documented below. The REQUIRED option stops process- ing
with an error message if the package cannot be found.</p>

<p>A package-specific list of required components may be
listed after the COMPONENTS option (or after the REQUIRED
option if present). Additional optional components may be
listed after OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS. Available components and
their influence on whether a package is considered to be
found are defined by the target package.</p>

<p>The [version] argument requests a version with which the
package found should be compatible (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). The EXACT option requests
that the version be matched exactly. If no [version] and/or
compo- nent list is given to a recursive invocation inside a
find-mod- ule, the corresponding arguments are forwarded
automatically from the outer call (including the EXACT flag
for [version]). Version support is currently provided only
on a package-by-pack- age basis (details below).</p>

<p>User code should generally look for packages using the
above simple signature. The remainder of this command
documentation specifies the full command signature and
details of the search process. Project maintainers wishing
to provide a package to be found by this command are
encouraged to read on.</p>

<p>The command has two modes by which it searches for
packages: &quot;Module&quot; mode and &quot;Config&quot;
mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked
with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file
called &quot;Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake&quot; in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the
file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is
respon- sible for finding the package, checking the version,
and produc- ing any needed messages. Many find-modules
provide limited or no support for versioning; check the
module documentation. If no module is found and the MODULE
option is not given the com- mand proceeds to Config
mode.</p>

<p>The complete Config mode command signature is:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
[REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]] [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
[NO_POLICY_SCOPE] [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]] [CONFIGS config1
[config2 ...]] [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]] [PATHS path1
[path2 ... ]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
[NO_DEFAULT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PATH] [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY] [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])</p>

<p>The CONFIG option may be used to skip Module mode
explicitly and switch to Config mode. It is synonymous to
using NO_MODULE. Config mode is also implied by use of
options not specified in the reduced signature.</p>

<p>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file
provided by the package to be found. A cache entry called
&lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory
containing the file. By default the command searches for a
package with the name &lt;package&gt;. If the NAMES option
is given the names following it are used instead of
&lt;package&gt;. The command searches for a file called
&quot;&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake&quot; for each
name specified. A replacement set of possible configura-
tion file names may be given using the CONFIGS option. The
search procedure is specified below. Once found, the
configura- tion file is read and processed by CMake. Since
the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents. The full path to the
configuration file is stored in the cmake variable
&lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.</p>

<p>All configuration files which have been considered by
CMake while searching for an installation of the package
with an appropriate version are stored in the cmake variable
&lt;pack- age&gt;_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS, the associated
versions in &lt;pack- age&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS.</p>

<p>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake
will generate an error describing the problem unless the
QUIET argu- ment is specified. If REQUIRED is specified and
the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the
configure step stops executing. If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has
been set to a directory not containing a configuration file
CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.</p>

<p>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will
only find a version of the package that claims compatibility
with the requested version (format is
major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]). If the EXACT option is given
only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the
requested version may be found. CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers. Package
version numbers are checked by &quot;version&quot; files
provided by the packages themselves. For a candidate package
configuration file &quot;&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake&quot; the
corresponding ver- sion file is located next to it and named
either &quot;&lt;con- fig-file&gt;-version.cmake&quot; or
&quot;&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake&quot;. If no such
version file is available then the configuration file is
assumed to not be compatible with any requested version. A
basic version file containing generic version matching code
can be created using the macro
write_basic_package_version_file(), see its documentation
for more details. When a version file is found it is loaded
to check the requested version number. The version file is
loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables
have been defined:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_FIND_NAME = the &lt;package&gt; name
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION = full requested version string
PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested,
else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version
if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak
version if requested, else 0 PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>The version file checks whether it satisfies the
requested ver- sion and sets these variables:</p>

<p>PACKAGE_VERSION = full provided version string
PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT = true if version is exact match
PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any
version</p>

<p>These variables are checked by the find_package command
to determine whether the configuration file provides an
acceptable version. They are not available after the
find_package call returns. If the version is acceptable the
following variables are set:</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_VERSION = full provided version string
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided,
else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if provided, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_VERSION_TWEAK =
tweak version if provided, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_VERSION_COUNT = number of version
components, 0 to 4</p>

<p>and the corresponding package configuration file is
loaded. When multiple package configuration files are
available whose version files claim compatibility with the
version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen. No
attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version
number.</p>

<p>Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search
proce- dure. Much of the interface is provided for
completeness and for use internally by find-modules loaded
by Module mode. Most user code should simply call</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; [major[.minor]] [EXACT]
[REQUIRED|QUIET])</p>

<p>in order to find a package. Package maintainers
providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged
to name and install them such that the procedure outlined
below will find them with- out requiring use of additional
options.</p>

<p>CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes
for the package. Under each prefix several directories are
searched for a configuration file. The tables below show the
directories searched. Each entry is meant for installation
trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A)
conventions.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/ (W) &lt;prefix&gt;/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/cmake/&lt;name&gt;*/
(U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/
(U)
&lt;prefix&gt;/(lib/&lt;arch&gt;|lib|share)/&lt;name&gt;*/(cmake|CMake)/
(U)</p>

<p>On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application
Bundles the following directories are searched for
frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:</p>

(A)</p>

<p>In all cases the &lt;name&gt; is treated as
case-insensitive and cor- responds to any of the names
specified (&lt;package&gt; or names given by NAMES). Paths
with lib/&lt;arch&gt; are enabled if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set. If PATH_SUFFIXES is
speci- fied the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U)
directory entry one-by-one.</p>

<p>This set of directories is intended to work in
cooperation with projects that provide configuration files
in their installation trees. Directories above marked with
(W) are intended for installations on Windows where the
prefix may point at the top of an applications installation
directory. Those marked with (U) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared
by multiple packages. This is merely a conven- tion, so all
(W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.
Directories marked with (A) are intended for instal- lations
on Apple platforms. The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference
as specified below.</p>

<p>The set of installation prefixes is constructed using
the fol- lowing steps. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all
NO_* options are enabled.</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_DIR CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint provided by the location of another item already found.
Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.
Path entries ending in &quot;/bin&quot; or &quot;/sbin&quot;
are automatically converted to their parent directories.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search project build trees recently configured in a
CMake GUI. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is
passed. It is intended for the case when a user is building
multiple depen- dent projects one after another.</p>

<p>6. Search paths stored in the CMake user package
registry. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
is passed. On Win- dows a &lt;package&gt; may appear under
registry key</p>

<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USERtwareKitware as a REG_SZ value, with
arbitrary name, that specifies the directory containing the
package configuration file. On UNIX platforms a
&lt;package&gt; may appear under the directory</p>

<p>~/.cmake/packages/&lt;package&gt;</p>

<p>as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies
the directory containing the package configuration file. See
the export(PACKAGE) command to create user package registry
entries for project build trees.</p>

<p>7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>8. Search paths stored in the CMake system package
registry. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed. On Windows a
&lt;package&gt; may appear under registry key</p>

<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEtwareKitware as a REG_SZ value, with
arbitrary name, that specifies the directory containing the
package configuration file. There is no system package
registry on non-Windows platforms.</p>

<p>9. Search paths specified by the PATHS option. These are
typi- cally hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_package(&lt;package&gt; PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_package(&lt;package&gt;)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call can be disabled
by set- ting the variable
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;package&gt; to TRUE. See the
documentation for the CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;pack-
age&gt; variable for more information.</p>

<p>When loading a find module or package configuration file
find_package defines variables to provide information about
the call arguments (and restores their original state before
return- ing):</p>

<p>&lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED = true if REQUIRED option
was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_QUIETLY = true if QUIET
option was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION = full
requested version string &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR
= major version if requested, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if
requested, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch
version if requested, else 0
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if
requested, else 0 &lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_COUNT =
number of version components, 0 to 4
&lt;package&gt;_FIND_VERSION_EXACT = true if EXACT option
was given &lt;package&gt;_FIND_COMPONENTS = list of
requested components &lt;package&gt;_FIND_REQUIRED_&lt;c&gt;
= true if component &lt;c&gt; is required false if component
&lt;c&gt; is optional</p>

<p>In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to
honor the request detailed by these variables; see the find
module for details. In Config mode find_package handles
REQUIRED, QUIET, and version options automatically but
leaves it to the package configuration file to handle
components in a way that makes sense for the package. The
package configuration file may set &lt;package&gt;_FOUND to
false to tell find_package that component requirements are
not satisfied.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>find_path Find the directory containing a file.</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_path( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a directory containing the
named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to
store the result of this command. If the file in a directory
is found the result is stored in the variable and the search
will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If
nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND,
and the search will be attempted again the next time
find_path is invoked with the same variable. The name of the
file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the
names listed after the NAMES argument. Additional search
locations can be specified after the PATHS argument. If ENV
var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment
variable var will be read and converted from a sys- tem
environment variable to a cmake style list of paths. For
example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path
vari- able. The argument after DOC will be used for the
documentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES specifies
additional subdi- rectories to check below each search
path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s
shell config- uration. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option. These
should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
hint pro- vided by the location of another item already
found. Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS
option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH INCLUDE</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
for the current system. This can be skipped if
NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/&lt;arch&gt; if
CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set, and
&lt;prefix&gt;/include for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH</p>

<p>6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in
the short-hand version of the command. These are typically
hard-coded guesses.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the
cmake vari- able CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or
one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find frameworks before
standard libraries or headers. This is the default on
Darwin. &quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find frameworks after
standard libraries or headers. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try
to find frameworks. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
frameworks.</p>

<p>On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application
Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set
to empty or one of the following:</p>

<p>&quot;FIRST&quot; - Try to find application bundles
before standard programs. This is the default on Darwin.
&quot;LAST&quot; - Try to find application bundles after
standard programs. &quot;ONLY&quot; - Only try to find
application bundles. &quot;NEVER&quot; - Never try to find
application bundles.</p>

<p>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or
more directories to be prepended to all other search
directories. This effectively &quot;re-roots&quot; the
entire search under given loca- tions. By default it is
empty. It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point
to the root directory of the target environment and CMake
will search there too. By default at first the directories
listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted
directories will be searched. The default behavior can be
adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE. This
behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By
using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as
described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If
ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re-rooted
direc- tories will be searched.</p>

<p>The default search order is designed to be most-specific
to least-specific for common use cases. Projects may
override the order by simply calling the command multiple
times and using the NO_* options:</p>

<p>find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name PATHS paths...
NO_DEFAULT_PATH) find_path(&lt;VAR&gt; NAMES name)</p>

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified
as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for
A.framework/Head- ers/b.h. If that is found the path will be
set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to
the correct -F option to include the file.</p>

<p>find_program Find an executable program.</p>

<p>find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>This is the short-hand signature for the command that is
suffi- cient in many cases. It is the same as
find_program(&lt;VAR&gt; name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])</p>

<p>find_program( &lt;VAR&gt; name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
[HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]] [PATHS path1 [path2 ...
ENV var]] [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]] [DOC
&quot;cache documentation string&quot;] [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
[NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
[NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH] [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
[CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH | ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH] )</p>

<p>This command is used to find a program. A cache entry
named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this
command. If the program is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not be repeated unless the
variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be
&lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again
the next time find_program is invoked with the same
variable. The name of the program that is searched for is
specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS
argument. If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section
the environment variable var will be read and converted from
a system environment variable to a cmake style list of
paths. For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the
system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used
for the docu- mentation string in the cache. PATH_SUFFIXES
specifies addi- tional subdirectories to check below each
search path.</p>

<p>If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional
paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not
specified, the search process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache
variables. These are intended to be used on the command line
with a -DVAR=value. This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is
passed.</p>

<p>&lt;prefix&gt;/[s]bin for each &lt;prefix&gt; in
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH</p>

<p>2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment
vari- ables. These are intended to be set in the user s

option.</p>

<p>4. Search the standard system environment variables.
This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an
argument.</p>

<p>PATH</p>

<p>5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files

<p>Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will
be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search
again.</p>

<p>foreach Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...) COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... endforeach(loop_var)</p>

<p>All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach
are recorded without being invoked. Once the endforeach is
evalu- ated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once
for each argument listed in the original foreach command.
Before each iteration of the loop &quot;${loop_var}&quot;
will be set as a variable with the current value in the
list.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var RANGE total) foreach(loop_var RANGE
start stop [step])</p>

<p>Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of
numbers. There are three types of this iteration:</p>

<p>* When specifying single number, the range will have
elements 0 to &quot;total&quot;.</p>

<p>* When specifying two numbers, the range will have
elements from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>* The third optional number is the increment used to
iterate from the first number to the second number.</p>

<p>foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]] [ITEMS [item1
[...]]])</p>

<p>Iterates over a precise list of items. The LISTS option
names list-valued variables to be traversed, including empty
elements (an empty string is a zero-length list). The ITEMS
option ends argument parsing and includes all arguments
following it in the iteration.</p>

<p>function Start recording a function for later invocation
as a command.</p>

<p>function(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endfunction(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a function named &lt;name&gt; that takes
arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after
function, but before the matching endfunction, are not
invoked until the function is invoked. When it is invoked,
the commands recorded in the func- tion are first modified
by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments
passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to
referencing the formal parameters you can refer- ence the
variable ARGC which will be set to the number of argu- ments
passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ...
which will have the actual values of the arguments passed
in. This facilitates creating functions with optional
arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments
given to the function and ARGN holds the list of arguments
past the last expected argument.</p>

<p>A function opens a new scope: see set(var PARENT_SCOPE)
for details.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside functions.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property Get a property of the CMake
instance.</p>

<p>get_cmake_property(VAR property)</p>

<p>Get a property from the CMake instance. The value of the
prop- erty is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is
not found, VAR will be set to &quot;NOTFOUND&quot;. Some
supported properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES,
COMMANDS, MACROS, and COM- PONENTS.</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_directory_property Get a property of DIRECTORY
scope.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY
&lt;dir&gt;] &lt;prop-name&gt;)</p>

<p>Store a property of directory scope in the named
variable. If the property is not defined the empty-string is
returned. The DIRECTORY argument specifies another directory
from which to retrieve the property value. The specified
directory must have already been traversed by CMake.</p>

<p>get_directory_property(&lt;variable&gt; [DIRECTORY
&lt;dir&gt;] DEFINITION &lt;var-name&gt;)</p>

<p>Get a variable definition from a directory. This form is
useful to get a variable definition from another
directory.</p>

<p>See also the more general get_property() command.</p>

<p>get_filename_component Get a specific component of a
full filename.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; &lt;FileName&gt;
&lt;COMP&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Set &lt;VAR&gt; to a component of &lt;FileName&gt;,
where &lt;COMP&gt; is one of:</p>

<p>DIRECTORY = Directory without file name NAME = File name
without directory EXT = File name longest extension (.b.c
from d/a.b.c) NAME_WE = File name without directory or
longest extension ABSOLUTE = Full path to file REALPATH =
Full path to existing file with symlinks resolved PATH =
Legacy alias for DIRECTORY (use for CMake &lt;= 2.8.11)</p>

<p>Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no
trailing slahes. The longest file extension is always
considered. If the optional CACHE argument is specified, the
result variable is added to the cache.</p>

<p>get_filename_component(&lt;VAR&gt; FileName PROGRAM
[PROGRAM_ARGS &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;] [CACHE])</p>

<p>The program in FileName will be found in the system
search path or left as a full path. If PROGRAM_ARGS is
present with PRO- GRAM, then any command-line arguments
present in the FileName string are split from the program
name and stored in &lt;ARG_VAR&gt;. This is used to separate
a program name from its arguments in a command line
string.</p>

<p>get_property Get a property.</p>

<p>get_property(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY
[dir] | TARGET &lt;target&gt; | SOURCE &lt;source&gt; | TEST
&lt;test&gt; | CACHE &lt;entry&gt; | VARIABLE&gt; PROPERTY
&lt;name&gt; [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])</p>

<p>Get one property from one object in a scope. The first
argument specifies the variable in which to store the
result. The second argument determines the scope from which
to get the property. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope must name one existing target.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope must name one source file.</p>

<p>TEST scope must name one existing test.</p>

<p>CACHE scope must name one cache entry.</p>

<p>VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to get. If the property is not set
an empty value is returned. If the SET option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been set. If the DEFINED option is given the
variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the
property has been defined such as with define_property. If
BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to
a string containing documenta- tion for the requested
property. If documentation is requested for a property that
has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.</p>

<p>if Conditionally execute a group of commands.</p>

<p>if(expression) # then section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... elseif(expression2) # elseif section.
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ... else(expression) #
else section. COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endif(expression)</p>

<p>Evaluates the given expression. If the result is true,
the com- mands in the THEN section are invoked. Otherwise,
the commands in the else section are invoked. The elseif and
else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif
clauses. Note that the expression in the else and endif
clause is optional. Long expressions can be used and there
is a traditional order of precedence. Parenthetical
expressions are evaluated first fol- lowed by unary
operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED. Then any
EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES
will be evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR
operators will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:</p>

<p>if(&lt;constant&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a
non-zero num- ber. False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO,
FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, , or ends in the suffix
-NOTFOUND . Named boolean constants are case-insensitive. If
the argument is not one of these constants, it is treated as
a variable:</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the variable is defined to a value that is not a
false constant. False otherwise. (Note macro arguments are
not vari- ables.)</p>

<p>if(NOT &lt;expression&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the expression is not true.</p>

<p>if(&lt;expr1&gt; AND &lt;expr2&gt;)</p>

<p>True if both expressions would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(&lt;expr1&gt; OR &lt;expr2&gt;)</p>

<p>True if either expression would be considered true
individually.</p>

<p>if(COMMAND command-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a command, macro or function
that can be invoked.</p>

<p>if(POLICY policy-id)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing policy (of the
form CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;).</p>

<p>if(TARGET target-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is an existing target, built or
imported.</p>

<p>if(EXISTS file-name) if(EXISTS directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the named file or directory exists. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)</p>

<p>True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two
files doesn t exist. Behavior is well-defined only for full
paths. If the file time stamps are exactly the same, an
IS_NEWER_THAN com- parison returns true, so that any
dependent build operations will occur in the event of a tie.
This includes the case of passing the same file name for
both file1 and file2.</p>

<p>if(IS_DIRECTORY directory-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a directory. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)</p>

<p>True if the given name is a symbolic link. Behavior is
well-defined only for full paths.</p>

<p>if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)</p>

<p>True if the given path is an absolute path.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; MATCHES regex)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value matches the
given regular expression.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; LESS &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; GREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; EQUAL
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is a valid
number and the inequality or equality is true.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STRLESS
&lt;variable|string&gt;) if(&lt;variable|string&gt;
STRGREATER &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; STREQUAL
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given string or variables value is
lexicographi- cally less (or greater, or equal) than the
string or variable on the right.</p>

<p>if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_LESS
&lt;variable|string&gt;) if(&lt;variable|string&gt;
VERSION_EQUAL &lt;variable|string&gt;)
if(&lt;variable|string&gt; VERSION_GREATER
&lt;variable|string&gt;)</p>

<p>Component-wise integer version number comparison
(version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).</p>

<p>if(DEFINED &lt;variable&gt;)</p>

<p>True if the given variable is defined. It does not
matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been
set.</p>

<p>if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))</p>

<p>The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated
first and then the remaining expression is evaluated as in
the previous examples. Where there are nested parenthesis
the innermost are evaluated as part of evaluating the
expression that contains them.</p>

<p>The if command was written very early in CMake s
history, pre- dating the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and
for convenience evaluates variables named by its arguments
as shown in the above signatures. Note that normal variable
evaluation with ${} applies before the if command even
receives the arguments. Therefore code like</p>

<p>set(var1 OFF) set(var2 &quot;var1&quot;) if(${var2})</p>

<p>appears to the if command as</p>

<p>if(var1)</p>

<p>and is evaluated according to the if(&lt;variable&gt;)
case documented above. The result is OFF which is false.
However, if we remove the ${} from the example then the
command sees</p>

<p>if(var2)</p>

<p>which is true because var2 is defined to
&quot;var1&quot; which is not a false constant.</p>

<p>Automatic evaluation applies in the other cases whenever
the above-documented signature accepts
&lt;variable|string&gt;:</p>

<p>1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to
see if it is a defined variable, if so the variables value
is used, otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>2) If the left hand argument to MATCHES is missing it
returns false without error</p>

<p>3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER
EQUAL are independently tested to see if they are defined
variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the
original value is used.</p>

<p>4) Both left and right hand arguments to STRLESS
STREQUAL STR- GREATER are independently tested to see if
they are defined variables, if so their defined values are
used otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>5) Both left and right hand argumemnts to VERSION_LESS
VER- SION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to
see if they are defined variables, if so their defined
values are used otherwise the original value is used.</p>

<p>6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to see if it
is a boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it
is assumed to be a variable and it is dereferenced.</p>

<p>7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR are
independently tested to see if they are boolean constants,
if so they are used as such, otherwise they are assumed to
be variables and are dereferenced.</p>

<p>include Load and run CMake code from a file or
module.</p>

<p>include(&lt;file|module&gt; [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE
&lt;VAR&gt;] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Load and run CMake code from the file given. Variable
reads and writes access the scope of the caller (dynamic
scoping). If OPTIONAL is present, then no error is raised if
the file does not exist. If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the
variable will be set to the full filename which has been
included or NOTFOUND if it failed.</p>

<p>If a module is specified instead of a file, the file
with name &lt;modulename&gt;.cmake is searched first in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH, then in the CMake module directory. There
is one exception to this: if the file which calls include()
is located itself in the CMake module directory, then first
the CMake module directory is searched and CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
afterwards. See also policy CMP0017.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for
discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.</p>

<p>list List operations.</p>

<p>list(LENGTH &lt;list&gt; &lt;output variable&gt;)
list(GET &lt;list&gt; &lt;element index&gt; [&lt;element
index&gt; ...] &lt;output variable&gt;) list(APPEND
&lt;list&gt; &lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...])
list(FIND &lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;output
variable&gt;) list(INSERT &lt;list&gt; &lt;element_index&gt;
&lt;element&gt; [&lt;element&gt; ...]) list(REMOVE_ITEM
&lt;list&gt; &lt;value&gt; [&lt;value&gt; ...])
list(REMOVE_AT &lt;list&gt; &lt;index&gt; [&lt;index&gt;
...]) list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES &lt;list&gt;) list(REVERSE
&lt;list&gt;) list(SORT &lt;list&gt;)</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given lists length.</p>

<p>GET will return list of elements specified by indices
from the list.</p>

<p>APPEND will append elements to the list.</p>

<p>FIND will return the index of the element specified in
the list or -1 if it wasnt found.</p>

<p>INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified
loca- tion.</p>

<p>REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the
list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the
given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the
given indices.</p>

<p>REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the
list.</p>

<p>REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in-place.</p>

<p>SORT sorts the list in-place alphabetically.</p>

<p>The list subcommands APPEND, INSERT, REMOVE_AT,
REMOVE_ITEM, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, REVERSE and SORT may create
new values for the list within the current CMake variable
scope. Similar to the SET command, the LIST command creates
new variable values in the current scope, even if the list
itself is actually defined in a parent scope. To propagate
the results of these operations upwards, use SET with
PARENT_SCOPE, SET with CACHE INTERNAL, or some other means
of value propagation.</p>

<p>NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of
strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For
example, set(var a b c d e) creates a list with a;b;c;d;e,
and set(var &quot;a b c d e&quot;) creates a string or a
list with one item in it.</p>

<p>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt;
is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the
list, with 0 representing the first list element. If
&lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from
the end of the list, with -1 repre- senting the last list
element. Be careful when counting with negative indices:
they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first
list element.</p>

<p>macro Start recording a macro for later invocation as a
command.</p>

<p>macro(&lt;name&gt; [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...) ...
endmacro(&lt;name&gt;)</p>

<p>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments
named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...). Commands listed after macro, but
before the match- ing endmacro, are not invoked until the
macro is invoked. When it is invoked, the commands recorded
in the macro are first mod- ified by replacing formal
parameters (${arg1}) with the argu- ments passed, and then
invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the
formal parameters you can reference the val- ues ${ARGC}
which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the
function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This
facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Addi-
tionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to
the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of arguments past the
last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro
and val- ues such as ARGN are not variables in the usual
CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the C
preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake
variables and/or better CMake scope control you should look
at the function command.</p>

<p>See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the
behavior of policies inside macros.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced Mark cmake cached variables as
advanced.</p>

<p>mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)</p>

<p>Mark the named cached variables as advanced. An advanced
vari- able will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs
unless the show advanced option is on. If CLEAR is the first
argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made
advanced. If nei- ther FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new
values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable
already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be
changed.</p>

<p>It does nothing in script mode.</p>

<p>math Mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>math(EXPR &lt;output variable&gt; &lt;math
expression&gt;)</p>

<p>EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and returns
result in the output variable. Example mathematical
expression is 5 * ( 10 + 13 ). Supported operators are + - *
/ % | &amp; ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; * / %. They have the same
meaning as they do in C code.</p>

<p>message Display a message to the user.</p>


<p>message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
&quot;message to display&quot; ...)</p>

<p>The optional keyword determines the type of message:</p>

<p>(none) = Important information STATUS = Incidental
information WARNING = CMake Warning, continue processing
AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
SEND_ERROR = CMake Error, continue processing, but skip
generation FATAL_ERROR = CMake Error, stop processing and
generation</p>

<p>The CMake command-line tool displays STATUS messages on
stdout and all other message types on stderr. The CMake GUI
displays all messages in its log area. The interactive
dialogs (ccmake and CMakeSetup) show STATUS messages one at
a time on a status line and other messages in interactive
pop-up boxes.</p>

<p>CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a
simple markup language. Non-indented text is formatted in
line-wrapped paragraphs delimited by newlines. Indented text
is considered pre-formatted.</p>

<p>option Provides an option that the user can optionally
select.</p>

<p>option(&lt;option_variable&gt; &quot;help string
describing option&quot; [initial value])</p>

<p>Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.
If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.</p>

<p>If you have options that depend on the values of other
options, see the module help for CMakeDependentOption.</p>

<p>return Return from a file, directory or function.</p>

<p>return()</p>

<p>Returns from a file, directory or function. When this
command is encountered in an included file (via include() or
find_pack- age()), it causes processing of the current file
to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it
is encountered in a file which is not included by another
file, e.g. a CMake- Lists.txt, control is returned to the
parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a
function, control is returned to the caller of the function.
Note that a macro is not a func- tion and does not handle
return like a function does.</p>

<p>separate_arguments Parse space-separated arguments into
a semicolon-separated list.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(&lt;var&gt;
&lt;UNIX|WINDOWS&gt;_COMMAND &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;)</p>

<p>Parses a unix- or windows-style command-line string
&quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot; and stores a semicolon-separated
list of the arguments in &lt;var&gt;. The entire command
line must be given in one &quot;&lt;args&gt;&quot;
argument.</p>

<p>The UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted
whites- pace. It recognizes both single-quote and
double-quote pairs. A backslash escapes the next literal
character ( are no special escapes (is just n).</p>

<p>The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command-line
using the same syntax the runtime library uses to construct
argv at startup. It separates arguments by whitespace that
is not dou- ble-quoted. Backslashes are literal unless they
precede dou- ble-quotes. See the MSDN article &quot;Parsing
C Command-Line Argu- ments&quot; for details.</p>

<p>separate_arguments(VARIABLE)</p>

<p>Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi-colon separated
list. All spaces are replaced with ;. This helps with
generating command lines.</p>

<p>set Set a CMake, cache or environment variable to a
given value.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt; [[CACHE &lt;type&gt;
&lt;docstring&gt; [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])</p>

<p>Within CMake sets &lt;variable&gt; to the value
&lt;value&gt;. &lt;value&gt; is expanded before
&lt;variable&gt; is set to it. Normally, set will set a
regular CMake variable. If CACHE is present, then the
&lt;vari- able&gt; is put in the cache instead, unless it is
already in the cache. See section Variable types in CMake
below for details of regular and cache variables and their
interactions. If CACHE is used, &lt;type&gt; and
&lt;docstring&gt; are required. &lt;type&gt; is used by the
CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a
value. The value for &lt;type&gt; may be one of</p>

<p>FILEPATH = File chooser dialog. PATH = Directory chooser
dialog. STRING = Arbitrary string. BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF
checkbox. INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent
variables).</p>

<p>If &lt;type&gt; is INTERNAL, the cache variable is
marked as internal, and will not be shown to the user in
tools like cmake-gui. This is intended for values that
should be persisted in the cache, but which users should not
normally change. INTERNAL implies FORCE.</p>

<p>Normally, set(...CACHE...) creates cache variables, but
does not modify them. If FORCE is specified, the value of
the cache vari- able is set, even if the variable is already
in the cache. This should normally be avoided, as it will
remove any changes to the cache variables value by the
user.</p>

<p>If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or
function creates a new scope. This command will set the
value of a vari- able into the parent directory or calling
function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand).
PARENT_SCOPE cannot be combined with CACHE.</p>

<p>If &lt;value&gt; is not specified then the variable is
removed instead of set. See also: the unset() command.</p>

<p>set(&lt;variable&gt; &lt;value1&gt; ...
&lt;valueN&gt;)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;variable&gt; is set to a semicolon
separated list of values.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )</p>

<p>in which case the environment variable will be set.</p>

<p>*** Variable types in CMake ***</p>

<p>In CMake there are two types of variables: normal
variables and cache variables. Normal variables are meant
for the internal use of the script (just like variables in
most programming lan- guages); they are not persisted across
CMake runs. Cache vari- ables (unless set with INTERNAL) are
mostly intended for config- uration settings where the first
CMake run determines a suitable default value, which the
user can then override, by editing the cache with tools such
as ccmake or cmake-gui. Cache variables are stored in the
CMake cache file, and are persisted across CMake runs.</p>

<p>Both types can exist at the same time with the same name
but different values. When ${FOO} is evaluated, CMake first
looks for a normal variable FOO in scope and uses it if set.
If and only if no normal variable exists then it falls back
to the cache variable FOO.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>The code set(FOO &quot;x&quot;) sets the normal variable
FOO. It does not touch the cache, but it will hide any
existing cache value FOO.</p>

<p>The code set(FOO &quot;x&quot; CACHE ...) checks for FOO
in the cache, ignoring any normal variable of the same name.
If FOO is in the cache then nothing happens to either the
normal variable or the cache variable. If FOO is not in the
cache, then it is added to the cache.</p>

<p>Finally, whenever a cache variable is added or modified
by a command, CMake also *removes* the normal variable of
the same name from the current scope so that an immediately
following evaluation of it will expose the newly cached
value.</p>

<p>Normally projects should avoid using normal and cache
variables of the same name, as this interaction can be hard
to follow. However, in some situations it can be useful. One
example (used by some projects):</p>

<p>A project has a subproject in its source tree. The child
project has its own CMakeLists.txt, which is included from
the parent CMakeLists.txt using add_subdirectory(). Now, if
the parent and the child project provide the same option
(for example a com- piler option), the parent gets the first
chance to add a user-editable option to the cache. Normally,
the child would then use the same value that the parent
uses. However, it may be necessary to hard-code the value
for the child projects option while still allowing the user
to edit the value used by the par- ent project. The parent
project can achieve this simply by set- ting a normal
variable with the same name as the option in a scope
sufficient to hide the option s cache variable from the
child completely. The parent has already set the cache
variable, so the childs set(...CACHE...) will do nothing,
and evaluating the option variable will use the value from
the normal variable, which hides the cache variable.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties Set a property of the
directory.</p>

<p>set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2
value2)</p>

<p>Set a property for the current directory and
subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will
report an error. The prop- erties include:
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES,
INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES.
ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be
cleaned as a part of &quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>set_property Set a named property in a given scope.</p>

<p>set_property(&lt;GLOBAL | DIRECTORY [dir] | TARGET
[target1 [target2 ...]] | SOURCE [src1 [src2 ...]] | TEST
[test1 [test2 ...]] | CACHE [entry1 [entry2 ...]]&gt;
[APPEND] [APPEND_STRING] PROPERTY &lt;name&gt; [value1
[value2 ...]])</p>

<p>Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope. The
first argument determines the scope in which the property is
set. It must be one of the following:</p>

<p>GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.</p>

<p>DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but
another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named
by full or relative path.</p>

<p>TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.</p>

<p>SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files. Note
that source file properties are visible only to targets
added in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt).</p>

<p>TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.</p>

<p>CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing
entries.</p>

<p>The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by
the name of the property to set. Remaining arguments are
used to compose the property value in the form of a
semicolon-separated list. If the APPEND option is given the
list is appended to any exist- ing property value.If the
APPEND_STRING option is given the string is append to any
existing property value as string, i.e. it results in a
longer string and not a list of strings.</p>

<p>site_name Set the given variable to the name of the
computer.</p>

<p>site_name(variable)</p>

<p>string String operations.</p>

<p>string(REGEX MATCH &lt;regular_expression&gt; &lt;output

<p>REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and
store the match in the output variable.</p>

<p>REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and store the matches in the output
variable as a list.</p>

<p>REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many
times as possible and substitute the replacement expression
for the match in the output. The replace expression may
refer to paren-delim- ited subexpressions of the match using
1, 2, ..., 9. Note that two backslashes (\1) are required in
CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.</p>

<p>REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in
the input with replace_string and store the result in the
output.</p>

<p>MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 will
compute a cryptographic hash of the input string.</p>

<p>COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the
strings and store true or false in the output variable.</p>

<p>ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII
charac- ters.</p>

<p>CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE
transforms a file.</p>

<p>TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower
characters.</p>

<p>LENGTH will return a given strings length.</p>

<p>SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string. If
length is -1 the remainder of the string starting at begin
will be returned.</p>

<p>STRIP will return a substring of a given string with
leading and trailing spaces removed.</p>

<p>RANDOM will return a random string of given length
consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default
length is 5 charac- ters and default alphabet is all numbers
and upper and lower case letters. If an integer RANDOM_SEED
is given, its value will be used to seed the random number
generator.</p>

<p>FIND will return the position where the given substring
was found in the supplied string. If the REVERSE flag was
used, the command will search for the position of the last
occurrence of the specified substring.</p>

<p>The following characters have special meaning in regular
expres- sions:</p>

<p>^ Matches at beginning of input $ Matches at end of
input . Matches any single character [ ] Matches any
character(s) inside the brackets [^ ] Matches any
character(s) not inside the brackets - Inside brackets,
specifies an inclusive range between characters on either
side e.g. [a-f] is [abcdef] To match a literal - using
brackets, make it the first or the last character e.g.
[+*/-] matches basic mathematical operators. * Matches
preceding pattern zero or more times + Matches preceding
pattern one or more times ? Matches preceding pattern zero
or once only | Matches a pattern on either side of the | ()
Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced in
the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved by all
regular expression-related commands, including e.g. if(
MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).</p>

<p>*, + and ? have higher precedence than concatenation. |
has lower precedence than concatenation. This means that the
regular expression &quot;^ab+d$&quot; matches
&quot;abbd&quot; but not &quot;ababd&quot;, and the reg-
ular expression &quot;^(ab|cd)$&quot; matches &quot;ab&quot;
but not &quot;abd&quot;.</p>

<p>TIMESTAMP will write a string representation of the
current date and/or time to the output variable.</p>

<p>Should the command be unable to obtain a timestamp the
output variable will be set to the empty string
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>The optional UTC flag requests the current date/time
representa- tion to be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
rather than local time.</p>

<p>The optional &lt;format string&gt; may contain the
following format specifiers:</p>

<p>%d The day of the current month (01-31). %H The hour on
a 24-hour clock (00-23). %I The hour on a 12-hour clock
(01-12). %j The day of the current year (001-366). %m The
month of the current year (01-12). %M The minute of the
current hour (00-59). %S The second of the current minute.
60 represents a leap second. (00-60) %U The week number of
the current year (00-53). %w The day of the current week. 0
is Sunday. (0-6) %y The last two digits of the current year
(00-99) %Y The current year.</p>

<p>Unknown format specifiers will be ignored and copied to
the out- put as-is.</p>

<p>If no explicit &lt;format string&gt; is given it will
default to:</p>

<p>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S for local time. %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ for
UTC.</p>

<p>MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER will write a string which can be used
as an identifier in C.</p>

<p>unset Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment
variable.</p>

<p>unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])</p>

<p>Removes the specified variable causing it to become
undefined. If CACHE is present then the variable is removed
from the cache instead of the current scope.</p>

<p>&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such
as:</p>

<p>unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})</p>

<p>in which case the variable will be removed from the
current environment.</p>

<p>variable_watch Watch the CMake variable for change.</p>

<p>variable_watch(&lt;variable name&gt; [&lt;command to
execute&gt;])</p>

<p>If the specified variable changes, the message will be
printed about the variable being changed. If the command is
specified, the command will be executed. The command will
receive the fol- lowing arguments: COMMAND(&lt;variable&gt;
&lt;access&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;current list file&gt;
&lt;stack&gt;)</p>

<p>while Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is
true</p>

<p>while(condition) COMMAND1(ARGS ...) COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
... endwhile(condition)</p>

<p>All commands between while and the matching endwhile are
recorded without being invoked. Once the endwhile is
evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long
as the condi- tion is true. The condition is evaluated using
the same logic as the if command.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS CMake Compatibility Listfile
Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for
compatibility.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile
commands from pre- vious CMake versions, which are still
supported for compatibility rea- sons. You should instead
use the newer, faster and shinier new com- mands. ;-)</p>

<p>MODULES PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS Allow duplicate custom
targets to be created.</p>

<p>Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a
project have globally unique logical names (see policy
CMP0002). This is necessary to generate meaningful project
file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators. It also allows
the target names to be refer- enced unambiguously.</p>

<p>Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate
custom target names. For projects that care only about
Makefile gener- ators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS
IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow
duplicate custom targets. The property allows multiple
add_custom_target command calls in different directories to
specify the same target name. However, setting this property
will cause non-Makefile generators to pro- duce an error and
refuse to generate the project.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER Name of FOLDER for *_automoc
targets that are added automati- cally by CMake for targets
for which AUTOMOC is enabled.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake uses the FOLDER property of the parent
target as a default value for this property. See also the
documentation for the FOLDER target property and the AUTOMOC
target property.</p>

<p>DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS Specify which configurations are
for debugging.</p>

<p>The value must be a semi-colon separated list of
configuration names. Currently this property is used only by
the tar- get_link_libraries command (see its documentation
for details). Additional uses may be defined in the
future.</p>

<p>This property must be set at the top level of the
project and before the first target_link_libraries command
invocation. If any entry in the list does not match a valid
configuration for the project the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>DISABLED_FEATURES List of features which are disabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are disabled during the CMake
run. By default it contains the names of all packages which
were not found. This is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched
QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to
this list. This property is used by the macros in
FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_FEATURES List of features which are enabled
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.
By default it contains the names of all packages which were
found. This is determined using the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND
variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed.
A project can add its own features to this list. This
property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.</p>

<p>ENABLED_LANGUAGES Read-only property that contains the
list of currently enabled languages</p>

<p>Set to list of currently enabled languages.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS Whether FIND_LIBRARY should
automatically search lib64 directo- ries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying
whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search
the lib64 vari- ant of directories called lib in the search
path when building 64-bit binaries.</p>

<p>FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING Whether FIND_LIBRARY
should find OpenBSD-style shared libraries.</p>

<p>This property is a boolean specifying whether the
FIND_LIBRARY command should find shared libraries with
OpenBSD-style ver- sioned extension:
&quot;.so.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot;. The property is
set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE Enable global target
dependency graph debug mode.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. This property causes it to display details of
its analysis to stderr.</p>

<p>GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES Disallow global target
dependency graph cycles.</p>

<p>CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target
dependency graph at the beginning of native build system
generation. It reports an error if the dependency graph
contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC library
targets. This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles
completely, even among static libraries.</p>

<p>IN_TRY_COMPILE Read-only property that is true during a
try-compile configura- tion.</p>

<p>True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or
TRY_RUN command.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_FOUND List of packages which were found during
the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were found during the CMake run.
Whether a package has been found is determined using the
&lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND List of packages which were not found
during the CMake run.</p>

<p>List of packages which were not found during the CMake
run. Whether a package has been found is determined using
the &lt;NAME&gt;_FOUND variables.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER Name of FOLDER for targets
that are added automatically by CMake.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake uses
&quot;CMakePredefinedTargets&quot; as a default value for
this property. Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and
RUN_TESTS will be organized into this FOLDER. See also the
docu- mentation for the FOLDER target property.</p>

<p>REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES If set, report any undefined
properties to this file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to a filename then when CMake
runs it will report any properties or variables that were
accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this
property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix compiler commands with the
given launcher command line. This is intended to allow
launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.
Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the
given launcher command line. This is intended to allow
launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.
Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>Makefile generators prefix link and archive commands
with the given launcher command line. This is intended to
allow launch- ers to intercept build problems with high
granularity. Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this
property.</p>

<p>RULE_MESSAGES Specify whether to report a message for
each make rule.</p>

<p>This property specifies whether Makefile generators
should add a progress message describing what each build
rule does. If the property is not set the default is ON. Set
the property to OFF to disable granular messages and report
only as each target com- pletes. This is intended to allow
scripted builds to avoid the build time cost of detailed
reports. If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES cache entry exists its
value initializes the value of this prop- erty. Non-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.</p>

<p>TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS Set if shared
libraries may be named like archives.</p>

<p>On AIX shared libraries may be named
&quot;lib&lt;name&gt;.a&quot;. This prop- erty is set to
true on such platforms.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS Does the target platform
support shared libraries.</p>

<p>TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying
whether the target platform supports shared libraries.
Basically all current general general purpose OS do so, the
exception are usually embedded systems with no or special
OSs.</p>

<p>USE_FOLDERS Use the FOLDER target property to organize
targets into folders.</p>

<p>If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by
default. CMake generators that are capable of organizing
into a hierarchy of folders use the values of the FOLDER
target property to name those folders. See also the
documentation for the FOLDER target property.</p>

<p>__CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_ Internal property</p>

<p>Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES ADVANCED True if entry
should be hidden by default in GUIs.</p>

<p>This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is
consid- ered interesting only for advanced configuration.
The mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.</p>

<p>HELPSTRING Help associated with entry in GUIs.</p>

<p>This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help
users set it through a CMake GUI.</p>

<p>MODIFIED Internal management property. Do not set or
get.</p>

<p>This is an internal cache entry property managed by
CMake to track interactive user modification of entries.
Ignore it.</p>

<p>STRINGS Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI
selection.</p>

<p>For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a
set of values. CMake GUIs may use this to provide a
selection widget instead of a generic string entry field.
This is for conve- nience only. CMake does not enforce that
the value matches one of those listed.</p>

<p>TYPE Widget type for entry in GUIs.</p>

<p>Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs
present widgets to help users set values. The GUIs use this
property as a hint to determine the widget type. Valid TYPE
values are:</p>

<p>BOOL = Boolean ON/OFF value. PATH = Path to a directory.
FILEPATH = Path to a file. STRING = Generic string value.
INTERNAL = Do not present in GUI at all. STATIC = Value
managed by CMake, do not change. UNINITIALIZED = Type not
yet specified.</p>

<p>Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the
command which creates it (set, option, find_library,
etc.).</p>

<p>VALUE Value of a cache entry.</p>

<p>This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.
Set- ting this property always sets the value without
checking, so use with care.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.</p>

<p>A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the
&quot;make clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>CACHE_VARIABLES List of cache variables available in the
current directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
cache vari- ables currently defined. It is intended for
debugging purposes.</p>

<p>CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM Should the output of custom commands be
left.</p>

<p>If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for
this directory will not be removed during the &quot;make
clean&quot; stage.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a directorys sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;). This property will
be initialized in each direc- tory by its value in the
directorys parent.</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions in a directory.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. This property will be initialized in
each directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>COMPILE_OPTIONS List of options to pass to the
compiler.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far for this property. This property exists on directories
and targets.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the options for the compiler.</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_OPTIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0
$&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt; = configuration name
$&lt;BOOL:...&gt; = 1 if the ... is true, else 0
$&lt;STREQUAL:a,b&gt; = 1 if a is STREQUAL b, else 0
$&lt;ANGLE-R&gt; = A literal &gt;. Used to compare strings
which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>


<p>$&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS For CMake 2.4 compatibility only. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of flags
given so far to the add_definitions command. It is intended
for debugging purposes. Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
instead.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the directory from the all
target of its parent.</p>

<p>A property on a directory that indicates if its targets
are excluded from the default build target. If it is not,
then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause the
targets to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other generators.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a direc- tory.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in all targets within a
direc- tory. The property value is initialized in each
directory by its value in the directorys parent.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far to the include_directories command. This property exists
on direc- tories and targets. In addition to accepting
values from the include_directories command, values may be
set directly on any directory or any target using the
set_property command. A tar- get gets its initial value for
this property from the value of the directory property. A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory
if it has one. Both directory and target property values are
adjusted by calls to the include_directories command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the include paths for the compiler. See also the
include_directo- ries command.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION Include file scanning regular
expression.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the regular expression
used during dependency scanning to match include files that
should be followed. See the include_regular_expression
command.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION Enable interprocedural
optimization for targets in a directory.</p>

<p>If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if
they are known to be supported by the compiler.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a
directory.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA- TION. If set, this property
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_DIRECTORIES List of linker search directories.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of
directories given so far to the link_directories command. It
is intended for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>LISTFILE_STACK The current stack of listfiles being
processed.</p>

<p>This property is mainly useful when trying to debug
errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list
files are currently being processed, in order. So if one
listfile does an INCLUDE command then that is effectively
pushing the included listfile onto the stack.</p>

<p>MACROS List of macro commands available in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
macros cur- rently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes. See the macro command.</p>

<p>PARENT_DIRECTORY Source directory that added current
subdirectory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the source directory
that added the current source directory as a subdirectory of
the build. In the top-level directory the value is the
empty-string.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE Specify a launcher for compile
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM Specify a launcher for custom
rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>RULE_LAUNCH_LINK Specify a launcher for link rules.</p>

<p>See the global property of the same name for details.
This overrides the global property for a directory.</p>

<p>TEST_INCLUDE_FILE A cmake file that will be included
when ctest is run.</p>

<p>If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be
included and processed when ctest is run on the
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES List of variables defined in the current
directory.</p>

<p>This read-only property specifies the list of CMake
variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_&lt;section&gt; Specify a
postSolution global section in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Setting a property like this generates an entry of the
following form in the solution file:</p>

<p>GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = postSolution
&lt;contents based on property value&gt;
EndGlobalSection</p>

<p>The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list
of key=value pairs. Each such pair will be transformed into
an entry in the solution global section. Whitespace around
key and value is ignored. List elements which do not contain
an equal sign are skipped.</p>

<p>This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above;
it is ignored on other generators. The property only applies
when set on a directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a
project() com- mand.</p>

<p>Note that CMake generates postSolution sections
Extensibility- Globals and ExtensibilityAddIns by default.
If you set the cor- responding property, it will override
the default section. For example, setting
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override
the default contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section,
while keeping ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_&lt;section&gt; Specify a
preSolution global section in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Setting a property like this generates an entry of the
following form in the solution file:</p>

<p>GlobalSection(&lt;section&gt;) = preSolution
&lt;contents based on property value&gt;
EndGlobalSection</p>

<p>The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list
of key=value pairs. Each such pair will be transformed into
an entry in the solution global section. Whitespace around
key and value is ignored. List elements which do not contain
an equal sign are skipped.</p>

<p>This property only works for Visual Studio 7 and above;
it is ignored on other generators. The property only applies
when set on a directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a
project() com- mand.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES ABSTRACT Is this source file
an abstract class.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file represents a class that is abstract. This only makes
sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class
and it is only used by some tools that wrap classes into
other languages.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a source file.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).
Xcode does not support per-configuration definitions on
source files.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0
and Borland Makefiles , - broken in VS IDE % - broken in
some cases in NMake &amp; | - broken in some cases on MinGW
^ &lt; &gt;</p>

<p>CMake does not reject these values outright because they
do work in some cases. Use with caution.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a source file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS. Note that Xcode does not support
per-configuration source file flags so this property will be
ignored by the Xcode generator.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to be added when
compiling this source file.</p>

<p>These flags will be added to the list of compile flags
when this source file builds. Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to
pass additional preprocessor definitions.</p>

<p>EXTERNAL_OBJECT If set to true then this is an object
file.</p>

<p>If this property is set to true then the source file is
really an object file and should not be compiled. It will
still be linked into the target though.</p>

<p>Fortran_FORMAT Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the
Fortran source layout.</p>

<p>This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source
file uses fixed-format or free-format. CMake will pass the
corre- sponding format flag to the compiler. Consider using
the tar- get-wide Fortran_FORMAT property if all source
files in a target share the same format.</p>

<p>GENERATED Is this source file generated as part of the
build process.</p>

<p>If a source file is generated by the build process CMake
will handle it differently in terms of dependency checking
etc. Oth- erwise having a non-existent source file could
create problems.</p>

<p>HEADER_FILE_ONLY Is this source file only a header
file.</p>

<p>A property on a source file that indicates if the source
file is a header file with no associated implementation.
This is set automatically based on the file extension and is
used by CMake to determine if certain dependency information
should be com- puted.</p>

<p>KEEP_EXTENSION Make the output file have the same
extension as the source file.</p>

<p>If this property is set then the file extension of the
output file will be the same as that of the source file.
Normally the output file extension is computed based on the
language of the source file, for example .cxx will go to a
.o extension.</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
source file.</p>

<p>This property has meaning only when the source file is
listed in a target whose LABELS property is also set. No
other semantics are currently specified.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE What programming language is the file.</p>

<p>A property that can be set to indicate what programming
language the source file is. If it is not set the language
is determined based on the file extension. Typical values
are CXX C etc. Set- ting this property for a file means this
file will be compiled. Do not set this for headers or files
that should not be com- piled.</p>

<p>LOCATION The full path to a source file.</p>

<p>A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the
full path to the source file.</p>

<p>MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION Place a source file inside a Mac
OS X bundle, CFBundle, or framework.</p>

<p>Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set
are built as Mac OS X application bundles on Apple
platforms. Shared library targets with the FRAMEWORK
property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple
platforms. Module library targets with the BUNDLE property
set are built as Mac OS X CFBundle bundles on Apple
platforms. Source files listed in the target with this
property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle
or framework content folder specified by the property value.
For bundles the content folder is
&quot;&lt;name&gt;.app/Contents&quot;. For frameworks the
content folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.framework/Ver-
sions/&lt;version&gt;&quot;. For cfbundles the content
folder is &quot;&lt;name&gt;.bundle/Contents&quot; (unless
the extension is changed). See the PUBLIC_HEADER,
PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target proper- ties for
specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeaders, or
Resources directories.</p>

<p>OBJECT_DEPENDS Additional files on which a compiled
object file depends.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source
file depend. An object file will be recompiled if any of the
named files is newer than it.</p>

<p>This property need not be used to specify the dependency
of a source file on a generated header file that it
includes. Although the property was originally introduced
for this pur- pose, it is no longer necessary. If the
generated header file is created by a custom command in the
same target as the source file, the automatic dependency
scanning process will recognize the dependency. If the
generated header file is created by another target, an
inter-target dependency should be created with the
add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due
to linking relationships).</p>

<p>OBJECT_OUTPUTS Additional outputs for a Makefile
rule.</p>

<p>Additional outputs created by compilation of this source
file. If any of these outputs is missing the object will be
recom- piled. This is supported only on Makefile generators
and will be ignored on other generators.</p>

<p>SYMBOLIC Is this just a name for a rule.</p>

<p>If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system
will be informed that the source file is not actually
created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a
build rule.</p>

<p>WRAP_EXCLUDE Exclude this source file from any code
wrapping techniques.</p>

<p>Some packages can wrap source files into alternate
languages to provide additional functionality. For example,
C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG
etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is set to true (1 etc) that indicates
that this source file should not be wrapped.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TARGETS &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME Old
per-configuration target file base name.</p>

<p>This is a configuration-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.
Use OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; instead.</p>

<p>&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Postfix to append to the target
file name for configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When building with configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; the
value of this property is appended to the target file name
built on disk. For non-executable targets, this property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is
created. This property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks
and App Bundles.</p>

<p>&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET Value for symbol
visibility compile flags</p>

<p>The &lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET property determines
the value passed in a visibility related compile option,
such as -fvisi- bility= for &lt;LANG&gt;. This property only
has an affect for libraries and executables with exports.
This property is ini- tialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBIL- ITY_PRESET if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>ALIASED_TARGET Name of target aliased by this
target.</p>

<p>If this is an ALIAS target, this property contains the
name of the target aliased.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which archive
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for ARCHIVE target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set
when a tar- get is created.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for ARCHIVE target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for archive target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for ARCHIVE target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
ARCHIVE_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC Should the target be processed with automoc (for
Qt projects).</p>

<p>AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will
handle the Qt moc preprocessor automatically, i.e. without
having to use the QT4_WRAP_CPP() or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.
Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported. When this property is
set to TRUE, CMake will scan the source files at build time
and invoke moc accordingly. If an #include statement like
#include &quot;moc_foo.cpp&quot; is found, the Q_OBJECT
class declaration is expected in the header, and moc is run
on the header file. If an #include statement like #include
&quot;foo.moc&quot; is found, then a Q_OBJECT is expected in
the current source file and moc is run on the file itself.
Addition- ally, all header files are parsed for Q_OBJECT
macros, and if found, moc is also executed on those files.
The resulting moc files, which are not included as shown
above in any of the source files are included in a generated
&lt;targetname&gt;_auto- moc.cpp file, which is compiled as
part of the target.This prop- erty is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_AUTOMOC if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>Additional command line options for moc can be set via
the AUTO- MOC_MOC_OPTIONS property.</p>

<p>By setting the CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE variable to
TRUE the rules for searching the files which will be
processed by moc can be relaxed. See the documentation for
this variable for more details.</p>

<p>The global property AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER can be used
to group the automoc targets together in an IDE, e.g. in
MSVS.</p>

<p>AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS Additional options for moc when
using automoc (see the AUTOMOC property)</p>

<p>This property is only used if the AUTOMOC property is
set to TRUE for this target. In this case, it holds
additional command line options which will be used when moc
is executed during the build, i.e. it is equivalent to the
optional OPTIONS argument of the qt4_wrap_cpp() macro.</p>

<p>By default it is empty.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Should build tree targets have
install tree rpaths.</p>

<p>BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether
to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.
This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the
need for relink- ing before installation. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>BUNDLE This target is a CFBundle on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a module library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a CFBundle when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a CFBundle
and will be suitable to be used for creating Browser Plugins
or other application resources.</p>

<p>BUNDLE_EXTENSION The file extension used to name a
BUNDLE target on the Mac.</p>

<p>The default value is &quot;bundle&quot; - you can also
use &quot;plugin&quot; or whatever file extension is
required by the host app for your bundle.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL Properties which must be
compatible with their link interface</p>

<p>The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL property may contain a
list of propertiesfor this target which must be consistent
when evalu- ated as a boolean in the INTERFACE of all linked
dependees. For example, if a property &quot;FOO&quot;
appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
&quot;INTERFACE_FOO&quot; property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with
the &quot;FOO&quot; property in the dependee. Consistency in
this sense has the meaning that if the property is set, then
it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if
the property is not set, then it is ignored. Note that for
each dependee, the set of properties from this property must
not intersect with the set of properties from the
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING Properties which must be
string-compatible with their link interface</p>

<p>The COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property may contain a
list of properties for this target which must be the same
when evaluated as a string in the INTERFACE of all linked
dependees. For exam- ple, if a property &quot;FOO&quot;
appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
&quot;INTERFACE_FOO&quot; property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the
&quot;FOO&quot; property in the dependee. If the property is
not set, then it is ignored. Note that for each dependee,
the set of properties from this property must not intersect
with the set of properties from the
COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL property.</p>

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS Preprocessor definitions for
compiling a targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a
semicolon-sepa- rated list of preprocessor definitions using
the syntax VAR or VAR=value. Function-style definitions are
not supported. CMake will automatically escape the value
correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).
This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CON- FIG&gt; where
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex.
&quot;COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are
not sup- ported by the native build tool. The VS6 IDE does
not support definition values with spaces (but NMake
does).</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

<p>$&lt;0:...&gt; = empty string (ignores &quot;...&quot;)
$&lt;1:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;CONFIG:cfg&gt; = 1 if config is &quot;cfg&quot;, else 0

which contain a &gt; for example. $&lt;COMMA&gt; = A literal
,. Used to compare strings which contain a , for example.
$&lt;SEMICOLON&gt; = A literal ;. Used to prevent list
expansion on an argument with ;. $&lt;JOIN:list,...&gt; =
joins the list with the content of &quot;...&quot;
$&lt;TARGET_NAME:...&gt; = Marks ... as being the name of a
target. This is required if exporting targets to multiple
dependent export sets. The ... must be a literal name of a
target- it may not contain generator expressions.
$&lt;INSTALL_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of &quot;...&quot;
when the property is exported using install(EXPORT), and
empty otherwise. $&lt;BUILD_INTERFACE:...&gt; = content of
&quot;...&quot; when the property is exported using
export(), or when the target is used by another target in
the same buildsystem. Expands to the empty string otherwise.
$&lt;C_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the C compiler
used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of the
C compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID&gt; = The CMake-id of the CXX compiler
used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_ID:comp&gt; = 1 if the CMake-id of
the CXX compiler matches comp, otherwise 0.
$&lt;VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is a version
greater than v2, else 0. $&lt;VERSION_LESS:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if
v1 is a version less than v2, else 0.
$&lt;VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2&gt; = 1 if v1 is the same version
as v2, else 0. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of
the C compiler used. $&lt;C_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if
the version of the C compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION&gt; = The version of the CXX
compiler used. $&lt;CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:ver&gt; = 1 if the
version of the CXX compiler matches ver, otherwise 0.
$&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt; = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a,
.lib, .so) $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with
soname (.so.3)</p>

<p>where &quot;tgt&quot; is the name of a target. Target
file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME
versions can produce the directory and file name
components:</p>

$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:tgt,prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target tgt.</p>

<p>Note that tgt is not added as a dependency of the target
this expression is evaluated on.</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_POLICY:pol&gt; = 1 if the policy was NEW
when the head target was created, else 0. If the policy was
not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1, else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0 , else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support
for escap- ing certain values. CMake has work-arounds for
many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass
correctly. If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly,
do not attempt to work-around the problem by adding escape
sequences to the value. Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.
Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header
file. Then report the limitation. Known limitations
include:</p>

<p># - broken almost everywhere ; - broken in VS IDE 7.0

<p>COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
preprocessor definitions on a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS.</p>

<p>COMPILE_FLAGS Additional flags to use when compiling
this targets sources.</p>

<p>The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler
flags used to build sources within the target. Use
COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor
definitions.</p>

<p>COMPILE_OPTIONS List of options to pass to the
compiler.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of options specified so
far for this property. This property exists on directories
and targets.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the options for the compiler.</p>

<p>Contents of COMPILE_OPTIONS may use &quot;generator

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>DEBUG_POSTFIX See target property
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This property is a special case of the more-general
&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX property for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL Define a symbol when compiling this target
s sources.</p>

<p>DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol
defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not
set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with
some substitutions if the target is not a valid C
identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they
are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.</p>

<p>ENABLE_EXPORTS Specify whether an executable exports
symbols for loadable mod- ules.</p>

<p>Normally an executable does not export any symbols
because it is the final program. It is possible for an
executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.
When this property is set to true CMake will allow other
targets to &quot;link&quot; to the exe- cutable with the
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command. On all plat- forms a
target-level dependency on the executable is created for
targets that link to it. For DLL platforms an import library
will be created for the exported symbols and then used for
link- ing. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are
DLL plat- forms. For non-DLL platforms that require all
symbols to be resolved at link time, such as Mac OS X, the
module will &quot;link&quot; to the executable using a flag
like &quot;-bundle_loader&quot;. For other non-DLL platforms
the link rule is simply ignored since the dynamic loader
will automatically bind symbols when the module is
loaded.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL Exclude the target from the all
target.</p>

<p>A property on a target that indicates if the target is
excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then
with a Make- file for example typing make will cause this
target to be built. The same concept applies to the default
build of other genera- tors. Installing a target with
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD Exclude target from
&quot;Build Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>This property is only used by Visual Studio generators 7
and above. When set to TRUE, the target will not be built
when you press &quot;Build Solution&quot;.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration version of target exclusion from
&quot;Build Solu- tion&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD. If the generic
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD is also set on a target,
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_&lt;CONFIG&gt; takes precedence
in configu- rations for which it has a value.</p>

<p>EXPORT_NAME Exported name for target files.</p>

<p>This sets the name for the IMPORTED target generated
when it this target is is exported. If not set, the logical
target name is used by default.</p>

<p>EchoString A message to be displayed when the target is
built.</p>

<p>A message to display on some generators (such as
makefiles) when the target is built.</p>

<p>FOLDER Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in
an IDE.</p>

<p>Targets with no FOLDER property will appear as top level
enti- ties in IDEs like Visual Studio. Targets with the same
FOLDER property value will appear next to each other in a
folder of that name. To nest folders, use FOLDER values such
as GUI/Dialogs with / characters separating folder
levels.</p>

<p>FRAMEWORK This target is a framework on the Mac.</p>

<p>If a shared library target has this property set to true
it will be built as a framework when built on the mac. It
will have the directory structure required for a framework
and will be suit- able to be used with the -framework
option</p>

<p>Fortran_FORMAT Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the
Fortran source layout.</p>

<p>This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source
files in a target use fixed-format or free-format. CMake
will pass the corresponding format flag to the compiler. Use
the source-specific Fortran_FORMAT property to change the
format of a specific source file. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY Specify output directory for
Fortran modules provided by the target.</p>

<p>If the target contains Fortran source files that provide
modules and the compiler supports a module output directory
this speci- fies the directory in which the modules will be
placed. When this property is not set the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the target s
source directory. If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property.</p>

<p>Note that some compilers will automatically search the
module output directory for modules USEd during compilation
but others will not. If your sources USE modules their
location must be specified by INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless
of this property.</p>

<p>GENERATOR_FILE_NAME Generators file for this target.</p>

<p>An internal property used by some generators to record
the name of the project or dsp file associated with this
target. Note that at configure time, this property is only
set for targets created by include_external_msproject().</p>

<p>GNUtoMS Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format
(.lib).</p>

<p>When linking a shared library or executable that exports
symbols using GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual
Studio installed convert the import library (.dll.a) from
GNU to MS format (.lib). Both import libraries will be
installed by install(TARGETS) and exported by
install(EXPORT) and export() to be linked by applications
with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.</p>

<p>If the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialize this property. The
variable must be set prior to the first command that enables
a language such as project() or enable_language(). CMake
provides the variable as an option to the user automatically
when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.</p>

<p>HAS_CXX Link the target using the C++ linker tool
(obsolete).</p>

<p>This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE
property to CXX. See that propertys documentation for
details.</p>

<p>IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM Specify #include line
transforms for dependencies in a target.</p>

<p>This property specifies rules to transform macro-like
#include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and
C++ source files. The list of rules must be
semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
&quot;A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%&quot; (the % must be lit-
eral). During dependency scanning occurrences of
A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value
given with the macro argument substituted for %. For
example, the entry</p>

<p>MYDIR(%)=&lt;mydir/%&gt;</p>

<p>will convert lines of the form</p>

<p>#include MYDIR(myheader.h)</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>#include &lt;mydir/myheader.h&gt;</p>

<p>allowing the dependency to be followed.</p>

<p>This property applies to sources in the target on which
it is set.</p>

<p>IMPORTED Read-only indication of whether a target is
IMPORTED.</p>

<p>The boolean value of this property is true for targets
created with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or
add_library. It is false for targets built within the
project.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS Configurations provided for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of configuration names available
for an IMPORTED target. The names correspond to
configurations defined in the project from which the target
is imported. If the importing project uses a different set
of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; prop- erty. Ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB Full path to the import library for an
IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the location of the &quot;.lib&quot; part of
a windows DLL. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_IMPLIB_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES Dependent shared
libraries of an imported shared library.</p>

<p>Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries
as part of their implementation. On some platforms the
linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared
libraries they are includ- ing in the link. Set this
property to the list of dependent shared libraries of an
imported library. The list should be disjoint from the list
of interface libraries in the INTER- FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property. On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries
to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add
appropriate files or paths to the link command line. Ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES Languages compiled
into an IMPORTED static library.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of languages of source files
compiled to produce a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as
&quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;). CMake accounts for these
languages when computing how to link a target to the
imported library. For example, when a C executable links to
an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker
to satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static
library.</p>

<p>This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC
libraries. This property is ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES Transitive link
interface of an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is
included when an IMPORTED library target is linked to
another target. The libraries will be included on the link
line for the target. Unlike the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
property, this property applies to all imported target
types, including STATIC libraries. This property is ignored
for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>This property is ignored if the target also has a
non-empty INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported. If set, this
property com- pletely overrides the generic property for the
named configura- tion.</p>

<p>This property is ignored if the target also has a
non-empty INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY Repetition count
for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.</p>

<p>This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of
IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLIC- ITY.</p>

<p>If set, this property completely overrides the generic
property for the named configuration.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION Full path to the main file on disk for
an IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on
disk. For executables this is the location of the executable
file. For bundles on OS X this is the location of the
executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application
bundle folder. For static libraries and modules this is the
location of the library or module. For shared libraries on
non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared
library. For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder. For
DLLs this is the location of the &quot;.dll&quot; part of
the library. For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of
the file to be linked. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the
configuration-spe- cific property
IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; is set. To get the location
of an imported target read one of the LOCATION or LOCA-
TION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME Specifies that an IMPORTED shared
library target has no &quot;son- ame&quot;.</p>

<p>Set this property to true for an imported shared library
file that has no &quot;soname&quot; field. CMake may adjust
generated link commands for some platforms to prevent the
linker from using the path to the library in place of its
missing soname. Ignored for non-imported targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
&lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME The &quot;soname&quot; of an IMPORTED
target of shared library type.</p>

<p>Set this to the &quot;soname&quot; embedded in an
imported shared library. This is meaningful only on
platforms supporting the feature. Ignored for non-imported
targets.</p>

<p>IMPORTED_SONAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; &lt;CONFIG&gt;-specific
version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.</p>

<p>Configuration names correspond to those provided by the
project from which the target is imported.</p>

<p>IMPORT_PREFIX What comes before the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the prefix (such as &quot;lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>IMPORT_SUFFIX What comes after the import library
name.</p>

<p>Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for
import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead
of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to
override the suffix (such as &quot;.lib&quot;) on an import
library name.</p>

<p>INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of preprocessor include file
search directories.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of directories given so
far to the include_directories command. This property exists
on direc- tories and targets. In addition to accepting
values from the include_directories command, values may be
set directly on any directory or any target using the
set_property command. A target gets its initial value for
this property from the value of the directory property. A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory
if it has one. Both directory and target prop- erty values
are adjusted by calls to the include_directories
command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the include paths for the compiler. See also the
include_directo- ries command.</p>

<p>Contents of INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

their own INCLUDE_DIRECTO- RIES property such as
$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTER- FACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES&gt;
to use the include directories speci- fied in the interface
of foo.</p>

<p>INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE Whether consumers
need to create a position-independent target</p>

<p>The INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property informs
con- sumers of this target whether they must set their
POSITION_INDE- PENDENT_CODE property to ON. If this property
is set to ON, then the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property on
all consumers will be set to ON. Similarly, if this property
is set to OFF, then the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property
on all consumers will be set to OFF. If this property is

must ensure that the targets that they link to have a
consistent requirement for their INTER-
FACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property.</p>

<p>INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES List of public

they are known to be supported by the compiler.</p>

<p>INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a
target.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZA- TION. If set, this property
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
target.</p>

<p>Target label semantics are currently unspecified.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which library
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for LIBRARY target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set
when a tar- get is created.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for LIBRARY target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for library target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for LIBRARY target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LIBRARY_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>LINKER_LANGUAGE Specifies language whose compiler will
invoke the linker.</p>

<p>For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this
sets the language whose compiler is used to link the target
(such as &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CXX&quot;). A typical value
for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main). If not set, the
language with the highest linker preference value is the
default. See documentation of
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREF- ERENCE variables.</p>

<p>If this property is not set by the user, it will be
calculated at generate-time by CMake.</p>

<p>LINK_DEPENDS Additional files on which a target binary
depends for linking.</p>

<p>Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to
files on which the link rule for this target depends. The
target binary will be linked if any of the named files is
newer than it.</p>

<p>This property is ignored by non-Makefile generators. It
is intended to specify dependencies on &quot;linker
scripts&quot; for custom Makefile link rules.</p>

<p>LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED Do not depend on linked shared
library files.</p>

<p>Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not
to add file-level dependencies on the shared library files
linked by this target. Modification to the shared libraries
will not be sufficient to re-link this target. Logical
target-level depen- dencies will not be affected so the
linked shared libraries will still be brought up to date
before this target is built.</p>

<p>This property is initialized by the value of the
variable CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a
target is cre- ated.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS Additional flags to use when linking this
target.</p>

<p>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags
to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will
add to the con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example,
DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.</p>

<p>LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration linker flags
for a target.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_FLAGS.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES List public interface libraries
for a shared library or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>By default linking to a shared library target
transitively links to targets with which the library itself
was linked. For an executable with exports (see the
ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive link
dependencies are used. This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list. When the
target is linked into another target the libraries listed
(and recursively their link interface libraries) will be
provided to the other target also. If the list is empty then
no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when
this target is linked into another target even if the
default set is non-empty. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES if
it is set when a target is created. This property is ignored
for STATIC libraries.</p>

<p>This property is overridden by the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property if policy CMP0022 is
NEW.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a
tar- get.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES. If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>This property is overridden by the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property if policy CMP0022 is
NEW.</p>

<p>This property is deprecated. Use
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY Repetition count for STATIC
libraries with cyclic dependencies.</p>

<p>When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic
dependencies the linker may need to scan more than once
through the archives in the strongly connected component of
the dependency graph. CMake by default constructs the link
line so that the linker will scan through the component at
least twice. This property specifies the minimum number of
scans if it is larger than the default. CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.</p>

<p>LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC
libraries.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
LINK_INTER- FACE_MULTIPLICITY. If set, this property
completely overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.</p>

<p>LINK_LIBRARIES List of direct link dependencies.</p>

<p>This property specifies the list of libraries or targets
which will be used for linking. In addition to accepting
values from the target_link_libraries command, values may be
set directly on any target using the set_property
command.</p>

<p>The target property values are used by the generators to
set the link libraries for the compiler. See also the tar-
get_link_libraries command.</p>

<p>Contents of LINK_LIBRARIES may use &quot;generator
expressions&quot; with the syntax &quot;$&lt;...&gt;&quot;.
Generator expressions are evaluated during build system
generation to produce information specific to each build
configuration. Valid expressions are:</p>

not set, the warning message for the policy will be emitted.
This generator expression only works for a subset of
policies. $&lt;INSTALL_PREFIX&gt; = Content of the install
prefix when the target is exported via INSTALL(EXPORT) and
empty otherwise.</p>

<p>Boolean expressions:</p>

<p>$&lt;AND:?[,?]...&gt; = 1 if all ? are 1 , else 0
$&lt;OR:?[,?]...&gt; = 0 if all ? are 0, else 1
$&lt;NOT:?&gt; = 0 if ? is 1, else 1</p>

<p>where ? is always either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Expressions with an implicit this target:</p>

<p>$&lt;TARGET_PROPERTY:prop&gt; = The value of the
property prop on the target on which the generator
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC End a link line such that static
system libraries are used.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default CMake adds an option at the end of the
library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type. This property switches the final
linker search type to -Bstatic regardless of how it started.
See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.</p>

<p>LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC Assume the linker looks for
static libraries by default.</p>

<p>Some linkers support switches such as -Bstatic and
-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared
libraries for -lXXX options. CMake uses these options to set
the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known
or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the
platform. By default the linker search type is assumed to be
-Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list. This
property switches the assumption to -Bstatic. It is intended
for use when linking an executable statically (e.g. with the
GNU -static option). See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.</p>

<p>LOCATION Read-only location of a target on disk.</p>

<p>For an imported target, this read-only property returns
the value of the LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property for an
unspecified con- figuration &lt;CONFIG&gt; provided by the
target.</p>

<p>For a non-imported target, this property is provided for
compat- ibility with CMake 2.4 and below. It was meant to
get the loca- tion of an executable targets output file for
use in add_cus- tom_command. The path may contain a
build-system-specific por- tion that is replaced at build
time with the configuration get- ting built (such as
&quot;$(ConfigurationName)&quot; in VS). In CMake 2.6 and
above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target
name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the
target location. In CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command
recog- nizes generator expressions to refer to target
locations any- where in the command. Therefore this property
is not needed for creating custom commands.</p>

<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of a
target after reading this property. These include properties
whose names match
&quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CON-
FIG&gt;)?&quot;, &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;, or
&quot;LINKER_LANGUAGE&quot;. Failure to follow this rule is
not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.</p>

<p>LOCATION_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Read-only property providing a
target location on disk.</p>

<p>A read-only property that indicates where a targets main
file is located on disk for the configuration
&lt;CONFIG&gt;. The property is defined only for library and
executable targets. An imported target may provide a set of
configurations different from that of the importing project.
By default CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses
an arbitrary available configura- tion. Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; property to map imported
configurations explicitly.</p>

<p>Do not set properties that affect the location of a
target after reading this property. These include properties
whose names match
&quot;(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_&lt;CON-
FIG&gt;)?&quot;, &quot;(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)&quot;, or
&quot;LINKER_LANGUAGE&quot;. Failure to follow this rule is
not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE Build an executable as an application
bundle on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
built on Mac OS X will be created as an application bundle.
This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the
Finder. See the MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for
information about creation of the Info.plist file for the
application bun- dle. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE if it is set when
a target is created.</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.</p>

<p>An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be
built as an application bundle on Mac OS X. By default its
Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called
MacOSXBundle- Info.plist.in located in the
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This property specifies an alternative
template file name which may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME
MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Specify a custom Info.plist
template for a Mac OS X Framework.</p>

<p>A library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as
a framework on Mac OS X. By default its Info.plist file is
cre- ated by configuring a template called MacOSXFramework-
Info.plist.in located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This
property specifies an alternative template file name which
may be a full path.</p>

<p>The following target properties may be set to specify
content to be configured into the file:</p>

<p>MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION</p>

<p>CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect
all tar- gets in a directory that do not have each specific
property set. If a custom Info.plist is specified by this
property it may of course hard-code all the settings instead
of using the target properties.</p>

<p>MACOSX_RPATH Whether to use rpaths on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true, the directory portion
of the&quot;install_name&quot; field of shared libraries
will default to &quot;@rpath&quot;.Runtime paths will also
be embedded in binaries using this target.This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH
if it is set when a target is cre- ated.</p>

<p>MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Map from project
configuration to IMPORTED targets configura- tion.</p>

<p>Set this to the list of configurations of an imported
target that may be used for the current projects
&lt;CONFIG&gt; configura- tion. Targets imported from
another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.
Setting this property tells CMake what imported con-
figurations are suitable for use when building the
&lt;CONFIG&gt; con- figuration. The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target is
selected. If this property is set and no matching
configurations are available, then the imported target is
considered to be not found. This property is ignored for
non-imported targets.</p>

<p>NAME Logical name for the target.</p>

<p>Read-only logical name for the target as used by
CMake.</p>

<p>NO_SONAME Whether to set &quot;soname&quot; when linking
a shared library or module.</p>

<p>Enable this boolean property if a generated shared
library or module should not have &quot;soname&quot; set.
Default is to set &quot;soname&quot; on all shared libraries
and modules as long as the platform sup- ports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries
or plugins. If you use it on normal shared libraries which
other targets link against, on some platforms a linker will
insert a full path to the library (as specified at link
time) into the dynamic section of the dependent binary.
There- fore, once installed, dynamic loader may eventually
fail to locate the library for the binary.</p>

<p>OSX_ARCHITECTURES Target specific architectures for OS
X.</p>

<p>The OSX_ARCHITECTURES property sets the target binary
architec- ture for targets on OS X. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES if it is set when a target is
created. Use OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; to set the
binary architectures on a per-configuration basis.
&lt;CONFIG&gt; is an upper-case name (ex:
&quot;OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG&quot;).</p>

<p>OSX_ARCHITECTURES_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration OS X
binary architectures for a target.</p>

<p>This property is the configuration-specific version of
OSX_ARCHITECTURES.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME Output name for target files.</p>

<p>This sets the base name for output files created for an
exe- cutable or library target. If not set, the logical
target name is used by default.</p>

<p>OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration target file
base name.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
OUTPUT_NAME.</p>

<p>PDB_NAME Output name for MS debug symbols .pdb file from
linker.</p>

<p>Set the base name for debug symbols file created for an
exe- cutable or shared library target. If not set, the
logical tar- get name is used by default.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration name for MS
debug symbols .pdb file.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
PDB_NAME.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory for MS debug
symbols .pdb file from linker.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which the MS
debug symbols will be placed by the linker. This property is
initial- ized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output directory for MS debug symbols .pdb files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when
a target is created.</p>

<p>This property is not implemented by the Visual Studio 6
genera- tor.</p>

<p>POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE Whether to create a
position-independent target</p>

<p>The POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property determines
whether posi- tion independent executables or shared
libraries will be cre- ated. This property is true by
default for SHARED and MODULE library targets and false
otherwise. This property is initial- ized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPEN- DENT_CODE if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PREFIX What comes before the library name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the prefix
(such as &quot;lib&quot;) on a library name.</p>

<p>PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT Deprecated install support.</p>

<p>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run
before and after installing a target. They are used only
when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the
target. Use the INSTALL command instead.</p>

<p>PRIVATE_HEADER Specify private header files in a
FRAMEWORK shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the PrivateHeaders
directory inside the frame- work folder. On non-Apple
platforms these headers may be installed using the
PRIVATE_HEADER option to the install(TAR- GETS) command.</p>

<p>PROJECT_LABEL Change the name of a target in an IDE.</p>

<p>Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE
like Visual Studio.</p>

<p>PUBLIC_HEADER Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK
shared library tar- get.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of header files to be placed in the Headers directory
inside the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these
headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to
the install(TARGETS) command.</p>

<p>RESOURCE Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared
library target.</p>

<p>Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK
property gener- ate frameworks on OS X and normal shared
libraries on other platforms. This property may be set to a
list of files to be placed in the Resources directory inside
the framework folder. On non-Apple platforms these files may
be installed using the RESOURCE option to the
install(TARGETS) command.</p>

This overrides the global and directory property for a
target.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Output directory in which to
build RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the directory into which runtime
target files should be built. Multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration subdirectory to the
specified directory. There are three kinds of target files
that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.
Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static
libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module
libraries are always treated as library targets. For non-DLL
platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets.
For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is
treated as a runtime target and the corre- sponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN-
TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is
created.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt;
Per-configuration output directory for RUNTIME target
files.</p>

<p>This is a per-configuration version of
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, but multi-configuration generators
(VS, Xcode) do NOT append a per-configuration subdirectory
to the specified directory. This property is initialized by
the value of the variable CMAKE_RUN-
TIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_&lt;CONFIG&gt; if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME Output name for RUNTIME target
files.</p>

<p>This property specifies the base name for runtime target
files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and
OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; properties. There are three kinds
of target files that may be built: archive, library, and
runtime. Executables are always treated as runtime targets.
Static libraries are always treated as archive targets.
Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For
non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library
targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library
is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import
library is treated as an archive target. All Win- dows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.</p>

<p>RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
output name for RUNTIME target files.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
RUNTIME_OUT- PUT_NAME.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Should rpaths be used for the build
tree.</p>

<p>SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip
auto- matic generation of an rpath allowing the target to
run from the build tree. This property is initialized by the
value of the variable CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set
when a target is created.</p>

<p>SOURCES Source names specified for a target.</p>

<p>Read-only list of sources specified for a target. The
names returned are suitable for passing to the
set_source_files_prop- erties command.</p>

<p>SOVERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and API version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number.
SOVERSION is ignored if NO_SONAME property is set. For
shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION
attribute is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot;
version number. These numbers are used as the image version
of the binary.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS Extra flags to use when linking
static libraries.</p>

<p>Extra flags to use when linking a static library.</p>

<p>STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Per-configuration
flags for creating a static library.</p>

<p>This is the configuration-specific version of
STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS.</p>

<p>SUFFIX What comes after the target name.</p>

<p>A target property that can be set to override the suffix
(such as &quot;.so&quot; or &quot;.exe&quot;) on the name of
a library, module or exe- cutable.</p>

<p>TYPE The type of the target.</p>

<p>This read-only property can be used to test the type of
the given target. It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY,
MODULE_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the
internal target types.</p>

<p>VERSION What version number is this target.</p>

<p>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used
to spec- ify the build version and API version respectively.
When build- ing or installing appropriate symlinks are
created if the plat- form supports symlinks and the linker
supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the
missing is assumed to have the same version number. For
executables VERSION can be used to specify the build
version. When building or installing appropriate sym- links
are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared
libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute
is parsed to extract a &quot;major.minor&quot; version
number. These numbers are used as the image version of the
binary.</p>

<p>VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN Whether to add a compile flag
to hide symbols of inline func- tions</p>

<p>The VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN property determines
whether a flag for hiding symbols for inline functions. the
value passed used in a visibility related compile option,
such as -fvisibility=. This property only has an affect for
libraries and executables with exports. This property is
initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN if it is set when a target
is created.</p>

<p>VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES Visual Studio managed project .NET
references</p>

<p>Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to
a gener- ated Visual Studio project. For example,
&quot;System;System.Win- dows.Forms&quot;.</p>

target framework version.</p>

<p>Used to specify the .NET target framework version for
C++/CLI. For example, &quot;v4.5&quot;.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_&lt;variable&gt; Visual Studio
project-specific global variable.</p>

<p>Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the global
variable &lt;variable&gt; to a given value in the generated
Visual Studio project. Ignored on other generators. Qt
integration works bet- ter if VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to
the version FindQt4.cmake found. For example,
&quot;4.7.3&quot;</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Sets the &quot;keyword&quot; attribute for a generated
Visual Studio project. Defaults to &quot;Win32Proj&quot;.
You may wish to override this value with
&quot;ManagedCProj&quot;, for example, in a Visual Studio
man- aged C++ unit test project.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES Visual Studio project
type(s).</p>

<p>Can be set to one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual
Studio to indicate the type of project. This value is copied
verbatim into the generated project file. Example for a
managed C++ unit test- ing project:</p>


<p>{3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}</p>

<p>UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.</p>

<p>VS_GLOBAL_ROOTNAMESPACE Visual Studio project root
namespace.</p>

<p>Sets the &quot;RootNamespace&quot; attribute for a
generated Visual Studio project. The attribute will be
generated only if this is set.</p>

<p>VS_KEYWORD Visual Studio project keyword.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for
example Qt integration works better if this is set to
Qt4VSv1.0.</p>

<p>VS_SCC_AUXPATH Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux
Path.</p>

<p>Can be set to change the visual studio source code
control aux- path property.</p>

<p>VS_WINRT_REFERENCES Visual Studio project Windows
Runtime Metadata references</p>

<p>Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to
a gen- erated Visual Studio project. For example,
&quot;Windows;Win- dows.UI.Core&quot;.</p>

<p>WIN32_EXECUTABLE Build an executable with a WinMain
entry point on windows.</p>

<p>When this property is set to true the executable when
linked on Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry
point instead of just main(). This makes it a GUI executable
instead of a con- sole application. See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
variable documentation to configure use of MFC for WinMain
executables. This property is initialized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXE- CUTABLE if it is set when a
target is created.</p>

<p>XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_&lt;an-attribute&gt; Set Xcode target
attributes directly.</p>

<p>Tell the Xcode generator to set &lt;an-attribute&gt; to
a given value in the generated Xcode project. Ignored on
other genera- tors.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES ON TESTS ATTACHED_FILES Attach a list of
files to a dashboard submission.</p>

<p>Set this property to a list of files that will be
encoded and submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the
test result.</p>

<p>ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL Attach a list of files to a
dashboard submission if the test fails.</p>

<p>Same as ATTACHED_FILES, but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.</p>

<p>COST Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test
set will be run in descending order of cost.</p>

<p>This property describes the cost of a test. You can
explicitly set this value; tests with higher COST values
will run first.</p>

<p>DEPENDS Specifies that this test should only be run
after the specified list of tests.</p>

<p>Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this
test is run.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Specify environment variables that should be
defined for running a test.</p>

<p>If set to a list of environment variables and values of
the form MYVAR=value those environment variables will be
defined while running the test. The environment is restored
to its previous state after the test is done.</p>

<p>FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION If the output matches this
regular expression the test will fail.</p>

<p>If set, if the output matches one of specified regular
expres- sions, the test will fail.For example:
FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
&quot;[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed&quot;</p>

<p>LABELS Specify a list of text labels associated with a
test.</p>

<p>The list is reported in dashboard submissions.</p>

<p>MEASUREMENT Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be
reported for a test.</p>

<p>If set to a name then that name will be reported to
CDASH as a named measurement with a value of 1. You may also
specify a value by setting MEASUREMENT to
&quot;measurement=value&quot;.</p>

<p>PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION The output must match this
regular expression for the test to pass.</p>

<p>If set, the test output will be checked against the
specified regular expressions and at least one of the
regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will
fail.</p>

<p>PROCESSORS How many process slots this test requires</p>

<p>Denotes the number of processors that this test will
require. This is typically used for MPI tests, and should be
used in con- junction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
option.</p>

<p>REQUIRED_FILES List of files required to run the
test.</p>

<p>If set to a list of files, the test will not be run
unless all of the files exist.</p>

<p>RESOURCE_LOCK Specify a list of resources that are
locked by this test.</p>

<p>If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they
are guar- anteed not to run concurrently.</p>

<p>RUN_SERIAL Do not run this test in parallel with any
other test.</p>

<p>Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test
PARAL- LEL_LEVEL option to specify that this test should not
be run in parallel with any other tests.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT How many seconds to allow for this test.</p>

<p>This property if set will limit a test to not take more
than the specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds
that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to
the next test. This setting takes precedence over
CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>WILL_FAIL If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail
flag of the test.</p>

<p>This property can be used for tests that are expected to
fail and return a non zero return code.</p>

<p>WORKING_DIRECTORY The directory from which the test
executable will be called.</p>

<p>If this is not set it is called from the directory the
test exe- cutable is located in.</p>

<p>VARIABLES CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
Ask CPack to error out as soon as a file with absolute
INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p>The fatal error is emitted before the installation of
the offending file takes place. Some CPack generators, like
NSIS,enforce this internally. This variable triggers the
defini- tion ofCMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
when CPack runsVariables common to all CPack generators</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR BUILD_SHARED_LIBS Global
flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if
on.</p>

<p>If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be
built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a
static library. This variable is often added to projects as
an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they
want to build the project using shared or static
libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES List of files which
have been installed using an ABSOLUTE DES- TINATION
path.</p>

<p>This variable is defined by CMake-generated
cmake_install.cmake scripts. It can be used (read-only) by
programs or scripts that source those install scripts. This
is used by some CPack genera- tors (e.g. RPM).</p>

<p>CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE Switch between strict and
relaxed automoc mode.</p>

<p>By default, automoc behaves exactly as described in the
documen- tation of the AUTOMOC target property. When set to
TRUE, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct
input file for moc even if it differs from the documented
behaviour. In this mode it e.g. also checks whether a header
file is intended to be processed by moc when a
&quot;foo.moc&quot; file has been included.</p>

<p>Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4
compatibility.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY Version of cmake required
to build project</p>

<p>From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this
speci- fies what version of CMake should be supported. By
default this value is the version number of CMake that you
are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake
to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that
were written to use older versions of CMake. This can be set
by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Specifies the build type on
single-configuration generators.</p>

<p>This statically specifies what build type
(configuration) will be built in this build tree. Possible
values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and
MinSizeRel. This variable is only meaningful to
single-configuration generators (such as make and Ninja)
i.e. those which choose a single configuration when CMake
runs to generate a build tree as opposed to
multi-configuration generators which offer selection of the
build configuration within the generated build environment.
There are many per-con- fig properties and variables
(usually following clean SOME_VAR_&lt;CONFIG&gt; order
conventions), such as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;,
specified as uppercase:
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL]. For
example, in a build tree configured to build type Debug,
CMake will see to having CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG settings get
added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS settings. See also
CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE Enables color output when using the
Makefile generator.</p>

<p>When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce
colored out- put. Default is ON.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Specifies the available build
types on multi-config generators.</p>

<p>This specifies what build types (configurations) will be
avail- able such as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc. This
has rea- sonable defaults on most platforms, but can be
extended to pro- vide other build types. See also
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for details of managing configuration data,
and CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES Enables tracing output for
target properties.</p>

<p>This variable can be populated with a list of properties
to gen- erate debug output for when evaluating target
properties. Cur- rently it can only be used when evaluating
the INCLUDE_DIRECTO- RIES, COMPILE_DEFINITIONS and
COMPILE_OPTIONS target properties. In that case, it outputs
a backtrace for each entry in the tar- get property. Default
is unset.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt; Variable
for disabling find_package() calls.</p>

<p>Every non-REQUIRED find_package() call in a project can
be dis- abled by setting the variable
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;Packa- geName&gt; to TRUE.
This can be used to build a project without an optional
package, although that package is installed.</p>

<p>This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.
Other- wise if the package has already been found in a
previous CMake run, the variables which have been stored in
the cache will still be there. In that case it is
recommended to remove the cache variables for this package
from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U</p>

<p>CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED Whether to issue deprecation
errors for macros and functions.</p>

<p>If TRUE, this can be used by macros and functions to
issue fatal errors when deprecated macros or functions are
used. This vari- able is FALSE by default.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION Ask
cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a file
with absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p>The fatal error is emitted before the installation of
the offending file takes place. This variable is used by
CMake-gen- erated cmake_install.cmake scripts. If one sets
this variable to ON while running the script, it may get
fatal error messages from the script.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES Prefixes to prepend when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what prefixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX
systems this is typically lib, meaning that when trying to
find the foo library it will look for libfoo.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Suffixes to append when
looking for libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies what suffixes to add to library names
when the find_library command looks for libraries. On
Windows systems this is typically .lib and .dll, meaning
that when trying to find the foo library it will look for
foo.dll etc.</p>

<p>CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE Tell find_package to
warn if called without an explicit mode.</p>

<p>If find_package is called without an explicit mode
option (MOD- ULE, CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no
Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake module is in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then
CMake implicitly assumes that the caller intends to search
for a package configuration file. If no pack- age
configuration file is found then the wording of the failure
message must account for both the case that the package is
really missing and the case that the project has a bug and
failed to provide the intended Find module. If instead the
caller specifies an explicit mode option then the failure
mes- sage can be more specific.</p>

<p>Set CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell
find_package to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.
This helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode in all
calls to find_package within a project.</p>

<p>CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX()
commands.</p>

<p>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in
FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful in cross-compiled
environments where some system directories contain
incompatible but possibly link- able libraries. For example,
on cross-compiled cluster environ- ments, this allows a user
to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others)
would normally search. By default this is empty; it is
intended to be set by the project. Note that
CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH takes a list of directory names, NOT a
list of prefixes. If you want to ignore paths under prefixes
(bin, include, lib, etc.), youll need to specify them
explicitly. See also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PRE- FIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME Default component
used in install() commands.</p>

<p>If an install() command is used without the COMPONENT
argument, these files will be grouped into a default
component. The name of this default install component will
be taken from this vari- able. It defaults to
&quot;Unspecified&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX Install directory used by
install.</p>

<p>If &quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is
built, this directory is prepended onto all install
directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
and c:/Program Files on Windows.</p>

<p>On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to
relocate the whole installation. DESTDIR means DESTination
DIRectory. It is commonly used by makefile users in order to
install software at non-default location. It is usually
invoked like this:</p>

<p>make DESTDIR=/home/john install</p>

<p>which will install the concerned software using the
installation prefix, e.g. &quot;/usr/local&quot; prepended
with the DESTDIR value which finally gives
&quot;/home/john/usr/local&quot;.</p>

<p>WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because
installation prefix usually contains a drive letter like in
&quot;C:/Program Files&quot; which cannot be prepended with
some other prefix.</p>

<p>The installation prefix is also added to
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRE- FIX_PATH so that find_package,
find_program, find_library, find_path, and find_file will
search the prefix for other soft- ware.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MFC_FLAG Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable
or dll.</p>

<p>This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable
MFC in the application. It should be set to 1 for the static
MFC library, and 2 for the shared MFC library. This is used
in Visual Studio 6 and 7 project files. The CMakeSetup
dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:</p>

<p>add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL) set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH List of directories to search for
CMake modules.</p>

<p>Commands like include() and find_package() search for
files in directories listed by this variable before checking
the default modules that come with CMake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if
true.</p>

<p>This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake
to tell CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.</p>

<p>CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; Default for CMake
Policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; when it is otherwise left unset.</p>

<p>Commands cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and
cmake_policy(VER- SION) by default leave policies introduced
after the given ver- sion unset. Set
CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; to OLD or NEW to
specify the default for policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;, where
&lt;NNNN&gt; is the policy number.</p>

<p>This variable should not be set by a project in CMake
code; use cmake_policy(SET) instead. Users running CMake may
set this variable in the cache (e.g. -DCMAKE_POL-
ICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;) to set a policy
not otherwise set by the project. Set to OLD to quiet a
policy warning while using old behavior or to NEW to try
building the project with new behavior.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(),
with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY Don t make the install
target depend on the all target.</p>

<p>By default, the &quot;install&quot; target depends on
the &quot;all&quot; target. This has the effect, that when
&quot;make install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is built,
first the &quot;all&quot; target is built, then the
installation starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is
set to TRUE, this dependency is not created, so the
installation process will start immediately, independent
from whether the project has been completely built or
not.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH Path to be ignored by
FIND_XXX() commands.</p>

<p>Specifies directories to be ignored by searches in
FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful in cross-compiled
environments where some system directories contain
incompatible but possibly link- able libraries. For example,
on cross-compiled cluster environ- ments, this allows a user
to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end machine that modules like FindX11 (and others)
would normally search. By default this contains a list of
directories containing incompatible binaries for the host
system. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE()
and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the
contained directories for the existence of the file which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYS- TEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY().
FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories
for the existence of the library which is currently
searched. By default it contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX()
commands. It contains the &quot;base&quot; directories, the
FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the
base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append
/include . By default this contains the standard directories
for the current system and the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. It is
NOT intended to be modified by the project, use
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PRO- GRAM_PATH, and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH Path used for searching by
FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p>Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM().
FIND_PRO- GRAM() will check each of the contained
directories for the existence of the program which is
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_PRO- GRAM_PATH for this.
See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE Specify a CMake file that
overrides platform information.</p>

<p>CMake loads the specified file while enabling support
for each language from either the project() or
enable_language() com- mands. It is loaded after CMakes
builtin compiler and platform information modules have been
loaded but before the information is used. The file may set
platform information variables to override CMakes
defaults.</p>

<p>This feature is intended for use only in overriding
information variables that must be set before CMake builds
its first test project to check that the compiler for a
language works. It should not be used to load a file in
cases that a normal include() will work. Use it only as a
last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any other
way. For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change
the default value used to initial- ize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before
it is cached. The override file should NOT be used to set
anything that could be set after languages are enabled, such
as variables like CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIREC- TORY that
affect the placement of binaries. Information set in the
file will be used for try_compile and try_run builds
too.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED Whether to issue deprecation
warnings for macros and functions.</p>

<p>If TRUE, this can be used by macros and functions to
issue dep- recation warnings. This variable is FALSE by
default.</p>

<p>CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION Ask
cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with
absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p>This variable is used by CMake-generated
cmake_install.cmake scripts. If one sets this variable to ON
while running the script, it may get warning messages from
the script.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM APPLE True if running
on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Set to true on Mac OS X.</p>

<p>BORLAND True if the Borland compiler is being used.</p>

<p>This is set to true if the Borland compiler is being
used.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CL_64 Using the 64 bit compiler from Microsoft</p>

<p>Set to true when using the 64 bit cl compiler from
Microsoft.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMPILER_2005 Using the Visual Studio 2005
compiler from Microsoft</p>

<p>Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler
from Microsoft.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_APPLE True for Apple OS X operating
systems.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is Apple OS X.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is being run
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM but for the host system instead
of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is running
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME but for the host system
instead of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
running on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR but for the host
system instead of the target system when cross
compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION OS version CMake is running
on.</p>

<p>The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION but for the host system
instead of the target system when cross compiling.</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_UNIX True for UNIX and UNIX like operating
systems.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like
(i.e. APPLE and CYGWIN).</p>

<p>CMAKE_HOST_WIN32 True on windows systems, including
win64.</p>

<p>Set to true when the host system is Windows and on
Cygwin.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE Target architecture library
directory name, if detected.</p>

<p>This is the value of
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected for one
of the enabled languages.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX Regex matching possible
target architecture library directory names.</p>

<p>This is used to detect
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the implicit
linker search path by matching the &lt;arch&gt; name.</p>

<p>CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX Maximum object file full-path
length allowed by native build tools.</p>

<p>CMake computes for every source file an object file name
that is unique to the source file and deterministic with
respect to the full path to the source file. This allows
multiple source files in a target to share the same name if
they lie in different directories without rebuilding when
one is added or removed. However, it can produce long full
paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a
hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds
a limit. CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that
is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may
have a lower limit. This variable may be set to specify the
limit explicitly. The value must be an integer no less than
128.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM Name of system cmake is compiling for.</p>

<p>This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this ${CMAKE_SYS-
TEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}. If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as
CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Name of the OS CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>This is the name of the operating system on which CMake
is tar- geting. On systems that have the uname command, this
variable is set to the output of uname -s. Linux, Windows,
and Darwin for Mac OS X are the values found on the big
three operating systems.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR The name of the CPU CMake is
building for.</p>

<p>On systems that support uname, this variable is set to
the out- put of uname -p, on windows it is set to the value
of the envi- ronment variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p>CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION OS version CMake is building
for.</p>

<p>A numeric version string for the system, on systems that
support uname, this variable is set to the output of uname
-r. On other systems this is set to major-minor version
numbers.</p>

<p>CYGWIN True for Cygwin.</p>

<p>Set to true when using Cygwin.</p>

<p>ENV Access environment variables.</p>

<p>Use the syntax $ENV{VAR} to read environment variable
VAR. See also the set() command to set ENV{VAR}.</p>

<p>MSVC True when using Microsoft Visual C</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is some version of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC10 True when using Microsoft Visual C 10.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 10.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC11 True when using Microsoft Visual C 11.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 11.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC12 True when using Microsoft Visual C 12.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 12.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC60 True when using Microsoft Visual C 6.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 6.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC70 True when using Microsoft Visual C 7.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 7.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC71 True when using Microsoft Visual C 7.1</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 7.1 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC80 True when using Microsoft Visual C 8.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 8.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC90 True when using Microsoft Visual C 9.0</p>

<p>Set to true when the compiler is version 9.0 of
Microsoft Visual C.</p>

<p>MSVC_IDE True when using the Microsoft Visual C IDE</p>

<p>Set to true when the target platform is the Microsoft
Visual C IDE, as opposed to the command line compiler.</p>

<p>MSVC_VERSION The version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ being
used if any.</p>

<p>Known version numbers are:</p>

<p>1200 = VS 6.0 1300 = VS 7.0 1310 = VS 7.1 1400 = VS 8.0
1500 = VS 9.0 1600 = VS 10.0 1700 = VS 11.0 1800 = VS
12.0</p>

<p>UNIX True for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.</p>

<p>Set to true when the target system is UNIX or UNIX like
(i.e. APPLE and CYGWIN).</p>

<p>WIN32 True on windows systems, including win64.</p>

<p>Set to true when the target system is Windows.</p>

<p>XCODE_VERSION Version of Xcode (Xcode generator
only).</p>

<p>Under the Xcode generator, this is the version of Xcode
as spec- ified in
&quot;Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist&quot; (such as
&quot;3.1.2&quot;).</p>

<p>VARIABLES COMMON TO ALL CPACK GENERATORS
CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES List of files which have
been installed using an ABSOLUTE DES- TINATION path.</p>

<p>This variable is a Read-Only variable which is set
internally by CPack during installation and before packaging
using CMAKE_ABSO- LUTE_DESTINATION_FILES defined in
cmake_install.cmake scripts. The value can be used within
CPack project configuration file and/or
CPack&lt;GEN&gt;.cmake file of &lt;GEN&gt; generator.</p>

<p>CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt; CPack generated options for
binary generators</p>

<p>The CPack.cmake module generates (when CPACK_GENERATOR
is not set) a set of CMake options (see CMake option
command) which may then be used to select the CPack
generator(s) to be used when launching the package
target.</p>

<p>CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR What CMake generator should be
used if the project is CMake project.</p>

<p>Defaults to the value of CMAKE_GENERATOR few users will
want to change this setting.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY Boolean
toggle to include/exclude top level directory (component
case).</p>

<p>Similar usage as CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY but
for the component case. See CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
documenta- tion for the detail.</p>

<p>CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS List of desktop links to
create</p>

<p>CPACK_GENERATOR List of CPack generators to use</p>

<p>If not specified, CPack will create a set of options
CPACK_BINARY_&lt;GENNAME&gt; (e.g., CPACK_BINARY_NSIS)
allowing the user to enable/disable individual generators.
This variable may be used on the command line as well as
in:</p>

<p>cpack -D CPACK_GENERATOR=&quot;ZIP;TGZ&quot;
/path/to/build/tree</p>

<p>CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY Boolean toggle to
include/exclude top level directory.</p>

<p>When preparing a package CPack installs the item under
the so-called top level directory. The purpose of is to
include (set to 1 or ON or TRUE) the top level directory in
the package or not (set to 0 or OFF or FALSE).</p>

<p>Each CPack generator has a built-in default value for
this vari- able. E.g. Archive generators (ZIP, TGZ, ...)
includes the top level whereas RPM or DEB dont. The user may
override the default value by setting this variable.</p>

<p>There is a similar variable CPACK_COMPO-
NENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY which may be used to
override the behavior for the component packaging case which
may have different default value for historical (now
backward compatibil- ity) reason.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES Extra directories to
install</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS List of four values that
specify what project to install.</p>

<p>The four values are: Build directory, Project Name,
Project Com- ponent, Directory. If omitted, CPack will build
an installer that installers everything.</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS Extra commands to install
components</p>

<p>CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPT Extra CMake script provided by the
user.</p>

<p>If set this CMake script will be executed by CPack
during its local [CPack-private] installation which is done
right before packaging the files. The script is not called
by e.g.: make install.</p>

<p>CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL Disables the component-based
installation mechanism.</p>

<p>When set the component specification is ignored and all
installed items are put in a single &quot;MONOLITHIC&quot;
package. Some CPack generators do monolithic packaging by
default and may be asked to do component packaging by
setting CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COM- PONENT_INSTALL to
1/TRUE.</p>

<p>CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE The name of the CPack binary
configuration file.</p>

<p>This file is the CPack configuration generated by the
CPack module for binary installers. Defaults to
CPackConfig.cmake.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE A text file used to
describe the project.</p>

<p>Used, for example, the introduction screen of a
CPack-generated Windows installer to describe the
project.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY Short description of
the project (only a few words).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY The directory in which CPack is
doing its packaging.</p>

<p>If it is not set then this will default (internally) to
the build dir. This variable may be defined in CPack config
file or from the cpack command line option &quot;-B&quot;.
If set the command line option override the value found in
the config file.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES Lists each of the executables
and associated text label to be used to create Start Menu
shortcuts.</p>

<p>For example, setting this to the list ccmake;CMake will
create a shortcut named &quot;CMake&quot; that will execute
the installed exe- cutable ccmake. Not all CPack generators
use it (at least NSIS and OSXX11 do).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME The name of the package file to
generate, not including the extension.</p>

<p>For example, cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686. The default value
is</p>


<p>${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON A branding image that will be
displayed inside the installer (used by GUI installers).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY Installation directory
on the target system.</p>

<p>This may be used by some CPack generators like NSIS to
create an installation directory e.g., &quot;CMake 2.5&quot;
below the installation prefix. All installed element will be
put inside this directory.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY Registry key used
when installing this project.</p>

<p>This is only used by installer for Windows. The default
value is based on the installation directory.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME The name of the package (or
application)</p>

<p>If not specified, defaults to the project name.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR The name of the package vendor</p>

<p>(e.g., &quot;Kitware&quot;).</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION Package full version, used
internally</p>

<p>By default, this is built from
CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR, CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR,
and CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH.</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR Package major Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR Package minor Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH Package patch Version</p>

<p>CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX The prefix used in the
built package.</p>

<p>Each CPack generator has a default value (like /usr).
This default value may be overwritten from the
CMakeLists.txt or the cpack command line by setting an
alternative value.</p>

<p>e.g. set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
&quot;/opt&quot;)</p>

<p>This is not the same purpose as CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
which is used when installing from the build tree without
building a package.</p>

<p>CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE CPack-time project CPack
configuration file.</p>

<p>This file included at cpack time, once per generator
after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR to the actual generator
being used. It allows per-generator setting of CPACK_*
variables at cpack time.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE License to be embedded in
the installer</p>

<p>It will typically be displayed to the user by the
produced installer (often with an explicit
&quot;Accept&quot; button, for graphical installers) prior
to installation. This license file is NOT added to installed
file but is used by some CPack generators like NSIS. If you
want to install a license file (may be the same as this one)
along with your project you must add an appro- priate CMake
INSTALL command in your CMakeLists.txt.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README ReadMe file to be embedded in
the installer</p>

<p>It typically describes in some detail the purpose of the
project during the installation. Not all CPack generators
uses this file.</p>

<p>CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME Welcome file to be embedded
in the installer.</p>

<p>It welcomes users to this installer. Typically used in
the graphical installers on Windows and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>CPACK_SET_DESTDIR Boolean toggle to make CPack use
DESTDIR mechanism when packag- ing.</p>

<p>DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory. It is commonly used
by makefile users in order to install software at
non-default loca- tion. It is a basic relocation mechanism
that should not be used on Windows (see CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
documentation). It is usu- ally invoked like this:</p>

<p>make DESTDIR=/home/john install</p>

<p>which will install the concerned software using the
installation prefix, e.g. &quot;/usr/local&quot; prepended
with the DESTDIR value which finally gives
&quot;/home/john/usr/local&quot;. When preparing a package,
CPack first installs the items to be packaged in a local (to
the build tree) directory by using the same DESTDIR
mechanism. Nev- ertheless, if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then
CPack will set DEST- DIR before doing the local install. The
most noticeable difference is that without
CPACK_SET_DESTDIR, CPack uses CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
as a prefix whereas with CPACK_SET_DESTDIR set, CPack will
use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as a prefix.</p>

<p>Manually setting CPACK_SET_DESTDIR may help (or simply
be neces- sary) if some install rules uses absolute
DESTINATION (see CMake INSTALL command). However, starting
with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM and DEB installers tries to
handle DESTDIR automatically so that it is seldom necessary
for the user to set it.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR List of generators used for the
source packages.</p>

<p>As with CPACK_GENERATOR, if this is not specified then
CPack will create a set of options (e.g., CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP)
allowing users to select which packages will be
generated.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES Pattern of files in the source
tree that won t be packaged when building a source
package.</p>

<p>This is a list of regular expression patterns (that must
be properly escaped), e.g.,
/CVS/;/\.svn/;\.swp$;\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE The name of the CPack
source configuration file.</p>

<p>This file is the CPack configuration generated by the
CPack mod- ule for source installers. Defaults to
CPackSourceConfig.cmake.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME The name of the source
package</p>

<p>For example cmake-2.6.1.</p>

<p>CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES List of files in the source
tree that will be stripped.</p>

<p>Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES will
be a boolean variable which enables stripping of all files
(a list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change
is compatible).</p>

<p>CPACK_STRIP_FILES List of files to be stripped</p>

<p>Starting with CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a
boolean variable which enables stripping of all files (a
list of files evaluates to TRUE in CMake, so this change is
compatible).</p>

<p>CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME System name, defaults to the value of
${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}.</p>

<p>CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG Directory for the installed files</p>

<p>CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION Ask CPack to
warn each time a file with absolute INSTALL DESTI- NATION is
encountered.</p>

<p>This variable triggers the definition of
CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSO- LUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION when CPack runs
cmake_install.cmake scripts.</p>

<p>VARIABLES CONCERNING CPACK COMPONENTS
CPACK_&lt;GENNAME&gt;_COMPONENT_INSTALL Enable/Disable
component install for CPack generator &lt;GENNAME&gt;.</p>

<p>Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG,
etc...) has a legacy default behavior. e.g. RPM builds
monolithic whereas NSIS builds component. One can change the
default behavior by setting this variable to 0/1 or
OFF/ON.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL The list of component to
install</p>

<p>The default value of this variable is computed by CPack
and con- tains all components defined by the project. The
user may set it to only include the specified
components.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING Specify how components are
grouped for multi-package compo- nent-aware CPack
generators.</p>

<p>Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP,
...) gen- erates several packages files when asked for
component packag- ing. They group the component differently
depending on the value of this variable:</p>

<p>- ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per
component group - ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single
package with all (requested) component - IGNORE : creates
one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group</p>

<p>One can specify different grouping for different CPack
generator by using a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DEPENDS The
dependencies (list of components) on which this component
depends.</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DESCRIPTION The
description of a component</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_DISPLAY_NAME The name
to be displayed for a component</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_GROUP The group of a
component</p>

<p>CPACK_COMPONENT_&lt;compName&gt;_REQUIRED True is this
component is required</p>

<p>VARIABLES FOR LANGUAGES
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND Rule variable to append to
a static archive.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to append
to a static archive. It is used in place of
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CRE- ATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms
in order to support large object counts. See also
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_CREATE and
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_FINISH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_CREATE Rule variable to
create a new static archive.</p>

<p>This is a rule variable that tells CMake how to finish a
static archive. It is used in place of
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_CRE- ATE_STATIC_LIBRARY on some platforms
in order to support large object counts. See also
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_CREATE and
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_ARCHIVE_APPEND.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER The full path to the

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_LOADED Defined to true if
the language is enabled.</p>

<p>When language &lt;LANG&gt; is enabled by project() or
enable_lan- guage() this variable is defined to 1.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILER_VERSION Compiler version
string.</p>

<p>Compiler version in major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]
format. This variable is not guaranteed to be defined for
all compilers or languages.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_COMPILE_OBJECT Rule variable to
compile a single object file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IGNORE_EXTENSIONS File extensions
that should be ignored by the build.</p>

<p>This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a
project for a given language but are not compiled.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header
files.</p>

<p>CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on
compiler command lines for language &lt;LANG&gt;. This
prevents system include directories from being treated as
user include directories on some compilers.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES Implicit
linker search path detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>Compilers typically pass directories containing language
runtime libraries and default library search paths when they
invoke a linker. These paths are implicit linker search
directories for the compiler s language. CMake automatically
detects these directories for each language and reports the
results in this variable.</p>

<p>When a library in one of these directories is given by
full path to target_link_libraries() CMake will generate the
-l&lt;name&gt; form on link lines to ensure the linker
searches its implicit direc- tories for the library. Note
that some toolchains read implicit directories from an
environment variable such as LIBRARY_PATH so keep its value
consistent when operating in a given build tree.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
Implicit linker framework search path detected for language
&lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>These paths are implicit linker framework search
directories for the compiler s language. CMake automatically
detects these directories for each language and reports the
results in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES Implicit link
libraries and flags detected for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>Compilers typically pass language runtime library names
and other flags when they invoke a linker. These flags are
implicit link options for the compilers language. CMake
automatically detects these libraries and flags for each
language and reports the results in this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE Target
architecture library directory name detected for
&lt;lang&gt;.</p>

<p>If the &lt;lang&gt; compiler passes to the linker an
architecture-spe- cific system library search directory such
as &lt;pre- fix&gt;/lib/&lt;arch&gt; this variable contains
the &lt;arch&gt; name if/as detected by CMake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE Preference value
for linker language selection.</p>

<p>The &quot;linker language&quot; for executable, shared
library, and module targets is the language whose compiler
will invoke the linker. The LINKER_LANGUAGE target property
sets the language explic- itly. Otherwise, the linker
language is that whose linker pref- erence value is highest
among languages compiled and linked into the target. See
also the CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPA- GATES
variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES True if
CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across tar-
gets.</p>

<p>This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a
target. Languages compiled directly into the target are
always consid- ered. A language compiled into static
libraries linked by the target is considered if this
variable is true.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_LINK_EXECUTABLE Rule variable to link
an executable.</p>

<p>Rule variable to link an executable for the given
language.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_OUTPUT_EXTENSION Extension for the
output of a compile for a single file.</p>

<p>This is the extension for an object file for the given
&lt;LANG&gt;. For example .obj for C on Windows.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_PLATFORM_ID An internal variable
subject to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the platform and is subject
to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR Size of
pointer-to-data types for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types
in the target platform ABI. It is defined for languages C
and CXX (C++).</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS Extensions of
source files for the given language.</p>

<p>This is the list of extensions for a given languages
source files.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU&lt;LANG&gt; True if the compiler
is GNU.</p>

<p>If the selected &lt;LANG&gt; compiler is the GNU
compiler then this is TRUE, if not it is FALSE. Unlike the
other per-language vari- ables, this uses the GNU syntax for
identifying languages instead of the CMake syntax.
Recognized values of the &lt;LANG&gt; suffix are:</p>

<p>CC = C compiler CXX = C++ compiler G77 = Fortran
compiler</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_DEFAULT Fortran default module
output directory.</p>

<p>Most Fortran compilers write .mod files to the current
working directory. For those that do not, this is set to
&quot;.&quot; and used when the Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
target property is not set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODDIR_FLAG Fortran flag for module output
directory.</p>

<p>This stores the flag needed to pass the value of the
For- tran_MODULE_DIRECTORY target property to the
compiler.</p>

<p>CMAKE_Fortran_MODOUT_FLAG Fortran flag to enable module
output.</p>

<p>Most Fortran compilers write .mod files out by default.
For others, this stores the flag needed to enable module
output.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI An internal variable subject
to change.</p>

<p>This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is
subject to change.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_&lt;LANG&gt; Specify a
CMake file that overrides platform information for
&lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p>This is a language-specific version of
CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE loaded only when enabling
lan- guage &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION The version of Mac OS X that the
resulting PackageMaker archive should be compatible
with.</p>

<p>Different versions of Mac OS X support different
features. For example, CPack can only build component-based
installers for Mac OS X 10.4 or newer, and can only build
installers that download component son-the-fly for Mac OS X
10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the
minimum version of Mac OS X that supports the requested
features. Set this variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only
if you want to guarantee that your installer will work on
that version of Mac OS X, and dont mind missing extra
features available in the installer shipping with later
versions of Mac OS X.</p>

are: lzma, xz, bzip2 and gzip.</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST list of path to be
excluded</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : /etc /etc/init.d /usr
/usr/share /usr/share/doc /usr/bin /usr/lib /usr/lib64
/usr/include May be used to exclude path (directories or
files) from the auto-generated list of paths discovered by
CPack RPM. The defaut value contains a reasonable set of
values if the variable is not defined by the user. If the
variable is defined by the user then CPackRPM will NOT any
of the default path. If you want to add some path to the
default list then you can use
CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION variable.</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION additional
list of path to be excluded</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to add more

installed using rpm --prefix or --relocate in order to
install it at an alternate place see rpm(8). Note that
currently this may fail if CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set to ON.
If CPACK_SET_DESTDIR is set then you will get a warning
message but if there is file installed with absolute path
youll get unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_REQUIRES RPM spec requires field</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to set RPM
dependencies (requires). Note that you must enclose the
complete requires string between quotes, for example:

the spec file. The refered script file(s) will be read and
directly put after the %post or %postun section If
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install
script for each component can be overridden with
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE One
may verify which scriptlet has been included with rpm -qp
--scripts package.rpm</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
CPACK_RPM_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE Mandatory : NO Default :
- May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the
spec file. The refered script file(s) will be read and
directly put after the %pre or %preun section If
CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL is set to ON the (un)install
script for each component can be overridden with
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE and
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE One
may verify which scriptlet has been included with rpm -qp
--scripts package.rpm</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST [deprecated]</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : - This way of specifying
post-install script is deprecated use
CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE May be used to set an RPM
post-install command inside the spec file. For example
setting it to &quot;/bin/true&quot; may be used to prevent
rpmbuild to strip binaries.</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE RPM extended spec definitions
lines</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : - May be used to add any
%define lines to the generated spec file.</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE A user provided spec
file</p>

<p>Mandatory : NO Default : - May be set by the user in
order to specify a USER binary spec file to be used by
CPackRPM instead of generating the file. The specified file
will be processed by configure_file( @ONLY). One can provide
a component specific file by setting
CPACK_RPM_&lt;componentName&gt;_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE.</p>

<p>CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST Mandatory : NO
Default : - May be used to explicitly specify
%(&lt;directive&gt;) file line in the spec file. Like
%config(noreplace) or any other directive that be found in
the %files section. Since CPackRPM is generating the list of
files (and directories) the user specified files of the
CPACK_RPM_&lt;COMPONENT&gt;_USER_FILELIST list will be
removed from the generated list.</p>

<p>VARIABLES SPECIFIC TO CPACK WIX GENERATOR
CPACK_WIX_CULTURES Language(s) of the installer</p>

<p>Languages are compiled into the WixUI extension library.
To use them, simply provide the name of the culture. If you
specify more than one culture identifier in a comma or
semicolon delim- ited list, the first one that is found will
be used. You can find a list of supported languages at:
http://wix.source-
forge.net/manual-wix3/WixUI_localization.htm</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF RTF License File</p>

<p>If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .rtf extension it
is used as-is.</p>

<p>If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .txt extension it
is implicitly converted to RTF by the WiX Generator.</p>

<p>With CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF you can override the license
file used by the WiX Generator in case
CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE is in an unsupported format or
the .txt -&gt; .rtf conversion does not work as
expected.</p>

launcher</p>

<p>If this variable is not set, it will be initialized with
CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_TEMPLATE Template file for WiX generation</p>

<p>If this variable is set, the specified template will be
used to generate the WiX wxs file. This should be used if
further cus- tomization of the output is required.</p>

<p>If this variable is not set, the default MSI template
included with CMake will be used.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UI_BANNER The bitmap will appear at the top of
all installer pages other than the welcome and completion
dialogs</p>

<p>If set, this image will replace the default banner
image.</p>

<p>This image must be 493 by 58 pixels.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UI_DIALOG Background bitmap used on the
welcome and completion dialogs</p>

<p>If this variable is set, the installer will replace the
default dialog image.</p>

<p>This image must be 493 by 312 pixels.</p>

<p>CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID Upgrade GUID
(Product/@UpgradeCode)</p>

<p>Will be automatically generated unless explicitly
provided.</p>

<p>It should be explicitly set to a constant generated
gloabally unique identifier (GUID) to allow your installers
to replace existing installations that use the same
GUID.</p>

<p>You may for example explicitly set this variable in your
CMake- Lists.txt to the value that has been generated per
default. You should not use GUIDs that you did not generate
yourself or which may belong to other projects.</p>

<p>A GUID shall have the following fixed length syntax:
XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</p>

<p>(each X represents an uppercase hexadecimal digit)</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX Default filename postfix for
libraries under configuration &lt;CON- FIG&gt;.</p>

<p>When a non-executable target is created its
&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX target property is initialized with
the value of this variable if it is set.</p>

<p>CMAKE_&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET Default value for
&lt;LANG&gt;_VISIBILITY_PRESET of targets.</p>

target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH Use the install path for
the RPATH</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with the install path
for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when
installed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX See variable
CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX.</p>

<p>This variable is a special case of the more-general
CMAKE_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG
configuration.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to create
executables.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating an
exe- cutable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be used

<p>CMAKE_GNUtoMS Convert GNU import libraries (.dll.a) to
MS format (.lib).</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the GNUtoMS property
on tar- gets when they are created. See that target property
for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR Automatically add the current
source- and build directories to the include path.</p>

<p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in
each directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path for this directory.
These additional include directories do not propagate down
to subdi- rectories. This is useful mainly for out-of-source
builds, where files generated into the build tree are
included by files located in the source tree.</p>

<p>By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE Automatically add
the current source- and build directories to the
INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.</p>

<p>If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds
for each shared library target, static library target,
module target and executable target,
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR} to the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.By
default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE is OFF.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR Mac OS X directory name for
installed targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the
INSTALL_NAME_DIR property on all targets. See that target
prop- erty for more information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH The rpath to use for installed
targets.</p>

<p>A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use
in installed targets (for platforms that support it). This
is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for
all targets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH Add paths to linker
search and installed rpath.</p>

<p>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if
set to true will append directories in the linker search
path and out- side the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is
used to initial- ize the target property
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all tar- gets.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
LIBRARY targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH_FLAG The flag to be used to add a
library search path to a compiler.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to specify a library directory to
the com- piler. On most compilers this is
&quot;-L&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_DEF_FILE_FLAG Linker flag to be used to
specify a .def file for dll creation.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to add a .def file when creating a
dll on Windows; this is only defined on Windows.</p>

LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG Flag to be used to link a
library specified by a path to its file.</p>

<p>The flag will be used before a library file path is
given to the linker. This is needed only on very few
platforms.</p>

<p>CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG Flag to be used to link a
library into an executable.</p>

<p>The flag will be used to specify a library to link to an
exe- cutable. On most compilers this is &quot;-l&quot;.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE Default value for MACOSX_BUNDLE of
targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the MACOSX_BUNDLE
property on all the targets. See that target property for
additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create modules.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
module.</p>

<p>CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a module.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating modules.</p>

<p>CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH Do not use the builtin ELF
editor to fix RPATHs on installation.</p>

<p>When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after
instal- lation than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a
builtin edi- tor to change the RPATH in the installed copy.
If this variable is set to true then CMake will relink the
binary before instal- lation instead of using its builtin
editor.</p>

<p>CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the MS debug
symbol files from linker.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that

that target property for additional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Where to put all the
RUNTIME targets when built.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See
that target property for addi- tional information.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create shared libraries.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
shared library.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a shared library.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating shared libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
build tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always built with no RPATH.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH Do not include RPATHs in the
install tree.</p>

<p>Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when
building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the
software is installed the executables etc are relinked by
CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to
true then the software is always installed without RPATH,
even if RPATH is enabled when building. This can be useful
for example to allow running tests from the build directory
with RPATH enabled before the installa- tion step. To omit
RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH instead.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS Linker flags to be used to
create static libraries.</p>

<p>These flags will be used by the linker when creating a
static library.</p>

<p>CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; Flags to be
used when linking a static library.</p>

<p>Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when
creating static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION Build configuration used
for try_compile and try_run projects.</p>

<p>Projects built by try_compile and try_run are built syn-
chronously during the CMake configuration step. Therefore a
specific build configuration must be chosen even if the
gener- ated build system supports multiple
configurations.</p>

<p>CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS Use relative paths (May not
work!).</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then CMake will use relative
paths between the source and binary tree. This option does
not work for more complicated projects, and relative paths
are used when possible. In general, it is not possible to
move CMake gener- ated makefiles to a different location
regardless of the value of this variable.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN Default value for
VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the
VISIBILITY_INLINES_HID- DEN property on all the targets. See
that target property for additional information.</p>

WIN32_EXECUTABLE of targets.</p>

<p>This variable is used to initialize the WIN32_EXECUTABLE
prop- erty on all the targets. See that target property for
addi- tional information.</p>

<p>EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH Old executable location
variable.</p>

<p>The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes
this variable for a target if it is set. Executable targets
are oth- erwise placed in this directory.</p>

<p>LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH Old library location variable.</p>

<p>The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
LIBRARY_OUT- PUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
supercede this vari- able for a target if they are set.
Library targets are other- wise placed in this
directory.</p>

<p>VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION CMAKE_AR Name of
archiving tool for static libraries.</p>

<p>This specifies the name of the program that creates
archive or static libraries.</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARGC Number of command line arguments passed to
CMake in script mode.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the num- ber of command line arguments. See also
CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...</p>

<p>CMAKE_ARGV0 Command line argument passed to CMake in
script mode.</p>

<p>When run in -P script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the first command line argument. It then also sets
CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2, ... and so on, up to the number of
command line arguments given. See also CMAKE_ARGC.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR The path to the top level of the build
tree.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the top level of the current
CMake build tree. For an in-source build, this would be the
same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL Tool used for the actual build
process.</p>

<p>This variable is set to the program that will be needed
to build the output of CMake. If the generator selected was
Visual Stu- dio 6, the CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to
msdev, for Unix Make- files it will be set to make or gmake,
and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv. For NMake
Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding
special flags and commands based on the final build
environment.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR The directory with the
CMakeCache.txt file.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the directory that has the
CMake- Cache.txt file in it. This is the same as
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION Major version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the major version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION Minor version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the minor version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION Patch version of CMake used to
create the CMakeCache.txt file</p>

<p>This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a
CMake cache file. It is only different when a different
version of CMake is run on a previously created cache
file.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR Build-time reference to
per-configuration output subdirectory.</p>

<p>For native build systems supporting multiple
configurations in the build tree (such as Visual Studio and
Xcode), the value is a reference to a build-time variable
specifying the name of the per-configuration output
subdirectory. On Makefile generators this evaluates to
&quot;.&quot; because there is only one configuration in a
build tree. Example values:</p>

<p>$(IntDir) = Visual Studio 6 $(OutDir) = Visual Studio 7,
8, 9 $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10 $(CONFIGURATION) =
Xcode . = Make-based tools</p>

<p>Since these values are evaluated by the native build
system, this variable is suitable only for use in command
lines that will be evaluated at build time. Example of
intended usage:</p>

<p>add_executable(mytool mytool.c) add_custom_command(
OUTPUT out.txt COMMAND
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt DEPENDS mytool
in.txt ) add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)</p>

<p>Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for
this pur- pose but has been left for compatibility with
existing projects. Instead add_custom_command() recognizes
executable target names in its COMMAND option, so
&quot;${CMAKE_CUR-
RENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool&quot; can be
replaced by just &quot;mytool&quot;.</p>

<p>This variable is read-only. Setting it is undefined
behavior. In multi-configuration build systems the value of
this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol
&quot;CMAKE_INTDIR&quot; to the compilation of all source
files.</p>

<p>CMAKE_COMMAND The full path to the cmake executable.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands. (e.g.
/usr/local/bin/cmake</p>

<p>CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING Is CMake currently cross
compiling.</p>

<p>This variable will be set to true by CMake if CMake is
cross compiling. Specifically if the build platform is
different from the target platform.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND Full path to ctest command installed
with cmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CTest executable ctest
which is useful from custom commands that want to use the
cmake -E option for portable system commands.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR The path to the binary
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the build directory that is
currently being processed by cmake. Each directory added by
add_subdirec- tory will create a binary directory in the
build tree, and as it is being processed this variable will
be set. For in-source builds this is the current source
directory being processed.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR Full directory of the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
variable will always be set to the directory where the
listfile which is currently being processed
(CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE) is located. The value has dynamic
scope. When CMake starts processing com- mands in a source
file it sets this variable to the directory where this file
is located. When CMake finishes processing com- mands from
the file it restores the previous value. Therefore the value
of the variable inside a macro or function is the directory
of the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call
stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro or
function definition.</p>

<p>See also CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE Full path to the listfile
currently being processed.</p>

<p>As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this
variable will always be set to the one currently being
processed. The value has dynamic scope. When CMake starts
processing commands in a source file it sets this variable
to the location of the file. When CMake finishes processing
commands from the file it restores the previous value.
Therefore the value of the vari- able inside a macro or
function is the file invoking the bot- tom-most entry on the
call stack, not the file containing the macro or function
definition.</p>

<p>See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE The line number of the current
file being processed.</p>

<p>This is the line number of the file currently being
processed by cmake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR The path to the source
directory currently being processed.</p>

<p>This the full path to the source directory that is
currently being processed by cmake.</p>

<p>CMAKE_DL_LIBS Name of library containing dlopen and
dlcose.</p>

<p>The name of the library that has dlopen and dlclose in
it, usu- ally -ldl on most UNIX machines.</p>

<p>CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.</p>

<p>This is the full path to the CMake executable that can
graphi- cally edit the cache. For example, cmake-gui,

<p>CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR The extra generator used to build
the project.</p>

<p>When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop
generators, CMake generates Makefiles (CMAKE_GENERATOR) and
additionally project files for the respective IDE. This IDE
project file generator is stored in CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
(e.g. &quot;Eclipse CDT4&quot;).</p>

<p>CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES Additional suffixes
for shared libraries.</p>

<p>Extensions for shared libraries other than that
specified by CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if any. CMake uses
this to recog- nize external shared library files during
analysis of libraries linked by a target.</p>

<p>CMAKE_GENERATOR The generator used to build the
project.</p>

<p>The name of the generator that is being used to generate
the build files. (e.g. &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot;,
&quot;Visual Studio 6&quot;, etc.)</p>

<p>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET Native build system toolset name
specified by user.</p>

<p>Some CMake generators support a toolset name to be given
to the native build system to choose a compiler. If the user
specifies a toolset name (e.g. via the cmake -T option) the
value will be available in this variable.</p>

then the library search path is modified to look for 64 bit
libraries first.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH If true, do not add run time path
information.</p>

<p>If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is
not added to compiled executables. The default is to add
rpath informa- tion if the platform supports it. This allows
for easy running from the build tree. To omit RPATH in the
install step, but not the build step, use
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.</p>

<p>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR The path to the top level of the source
tree.</p>

being run. Releases use tweak &lt; 20000000 and development
versions use the date format CCYYMMDD for the tweak
level.</p>

<p>CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE Create verbose makefiles if
on.</p>

<p>This variable defaults to false. You can set this
variable to true to make CMake produce verbose makefiles
that show each com- mand line as it is used.</p>
