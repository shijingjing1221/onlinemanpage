<p>NAME speaker-test - command-line speaker test tone
generator for ALSA</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS speaker-test [-options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION speaker-test generates a tone that can be
used to test the speakers of a computer.</p>

<p>speaker-test by default will test the default device. If
you want to test another sound device you will have first to
get a list of all of the sound cards in your system and the
devices associated with those cards. Notice that there might
be for example, one device for analog sound, one for digital
sound and one for HDMI sound. To get the list of available
cards and devices you can run aplay -L.</p>

<p>$ aplay -L null Discard all samples (playback) or
generate zero samples (capture) default:CARD=ICH5 Intel
ICH5, Intel ICH5 Default Audio Device front:CARD=ICH5,DEV=0
Intel ICH5, Intel ICH5 Front speakers
surround40:CARD=ICH5,DEV=0 Intel ICH5, Intel ICH5 4.0
Surround output to Front and Rear speakers (...)</p>

<p>in the above example, there are four devices listed:
null, default, front and surround40. So, if you want to test
the last device you can run speaker-test -Dsurround40:ICH5
-c 6. The -c option will indicate that the six audio
channels in the device have to be tested.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c | --channels NUM NUM channels in stream</p>

<p>-D | --device NAME PCM device name NAME</p>

<p>-f | --frequency FREQ sine wave of FREQ Hz</p>

<p>--help Print usage help</p>

<p>-b | --buffer TIME Use buffer size of TIME microseconds.
When 0 is given, use the maximal buffer size. The default
value is 0.</p>

<p>-p | --period TIME Use period size of TIME microseconds.
When 0 is given, the periods given by -P option is used. The
default value is 0.</p>

<p>-P | --nperiods PERIODS Use number of periods. The
default value is 4.</p>

<p>-r | --rate RATE stream of RATE Hz</p>

<p>-t | --test pink|sine|wav -t pink means use pink noise
(default).</p>

<p>Pink noise is perceptually uniform noise -- that is, it
sounds like every frequency at once. If you can hear any
tone it may indicate resonances in your speaker system or
room.</p>

<p>-t sine means to use sine wave.</p>

<p>-t wav means to play WAV files, either pre-defined files
or given via -w option.</p>

<p>You can pass the number from 1 to 3 as a backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>-l | --nloops COUNT</p>

<p>Specifies the number of loops. Zero means to run
infinitely.</p>

<p>When -s option below with a valid channel is given,
speaker-test will perform always a single-shot without
looping.</p>

<p>-s | --speaker CHANNEL Do a single-shot speaker test for
the given channel. The chan- nel number starts from 1. The
channel number corresponds to left, right, rear-left,
rear-right, center, LFE, side-left, side-right, and so
on.</p>

<p>For example, when 1 is passed, it tests the left channel
only once rather than both channels with looping.</p>

<p>-w | --wavfile Use the given WAV file for the playback
instead of pre-defined WAV files.</p>

<p>-W | --wavdir Specify the directory containing WAV files
for playback. The default path is
/usr/share/sounds/alsa.</p>

<p>USAGE EXAMPLES Produce stereo sound from one stereo
jack:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:front -c2</p>

<p>Produce 4 speaker sound from two stereo jacks:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:surround40 -c4</p>

<p>Produce 5.1 speaker sound from three stereo jacks:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6</p>

<p>To send a nice low 75Hz tone to the Woofer and then exit
without touch- ing any other speakers:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6 -s1 -f75</p>

<p>To do a 2-speaker test using the spdif (coax or optical)
output:</p>

<p>speaker-test -Dplug:spdif -c2</p>

<p>AUTHOR The speaker-test program was written by James
Courtier-Dutton. Pink noise support was added by Nathan
Hurst. Further extensions by Takashi Iwai.</p>
