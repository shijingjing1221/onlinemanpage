<p>UTIMES(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UTIMES(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME utimes - set file access and modification times
(LEGACY)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int utimes(const char *path, const struct timeval
times[2]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The utimes() function shall set the access
and modification times of the file pointed to by the path
argument to the value of the times argument. The utimes()
function allows time specifications accurate to the
microsecond.</p>

<p>For utimes(), the times argument is an array of timeval
structures. The first array member represents the date and
time of last access, and the second member represents the
date and time of last modification. The times in the timeval
structure are measured in seconds and microseconds since the
Epoch, although rounding toward the nearest second may
occur.</p>

<p>If the times argument is a null pointer, the access and
modification times of the file shall be set to the current
time. The effective user ID of the process shall match the
owner of the file, or has write access to the file or
appropriate privileges to use this call in this manner. Upon
completion, utimes() shall mark the time of the last file
status change, st_ctime, for update.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno shall be
set to indicate the error, and the file times shall not be
affected.</p>

<p>ERRORS The utimes() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied by a component of the
path prefix; or the times argument is a null pointer and the
effective user ID of the process does not match the owner of
the file and write access is denied.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The times argument is not a null pointer and the
calling pro- cess effective user ID has write access to the
file but does not match the owner of the file and the
calling process does not have the appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>EROFS The file system containing the file is
read-only.</p>

<p>The utimes() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG Pathname resolution of a symbolic link
produced an intermediate result whose length exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE For applications portability, the
utime() function should be used to set file access and
modification times instead of utimes().</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS This function may be withdrawn in a
future version.</p>
