<p>NAME XConfigureRequestEvent - ConfigureRequest event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for ConfigureRequest events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* ConfigureRequest */
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window parent; Window window; int x, y; int
width, height; int border_width; Window above; int detail;
/* Above, Below, TopIf, BottomIf, Opposite */ unsigned long
value_mask; } XConfigureRequestEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The parent member is set to the parent window. The
window member is set to the window whose size, position,
border width, and/or stacking order is to be reconfigured.
The value_mask member indicates which components were
specified in the ConfigureWindow protocol request. The
corresponding values are reported as given in the request.
The remain- ing values are filled in from the current
geometry of the window, except in the case of above
(sibling) and detail (stack-mode), which are reported as
None and Above, respectively, if they are not given in the
request.</p>
