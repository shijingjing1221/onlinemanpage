<p>NAME iftab - static information about the network
interfaces</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The file /etc/iftab contains descriptive
information about the various network interfaces. iftab is
only used by the program ifrename(8) to assign a consistent
network interface name to each network interface.</p>

<p>/etc/iftab defines a set of mappings. Each mapping
contains an inter- face name and a set of selectors. The
selectors allow ifrename to iden- tify each network
interface on the system. If a network interface matches all
descriptors of a mapping, ifrename attempt to change the
name of the interface to the interface name given by the
mapping.</p>

<p>MAPPINGS Each mapping is described on a separate line,
it starts with an inter- face name, and contains a set of
descriptors, separated by space or tabs.</p>

<p>The relationship between descriptors of a mapping is a
logical and. A mapping matches a network interface only is
all the descriptors match. If a network interface doesn t
support a specific descriptor, it wont match any mappings
using this descriptor.</p>

<p>If you want to use alternate descriptors for an
interface name (logical or), specify two different mappings
with the same interface name (one on each line). Ifrename
always use the first matching mapping starting from the end
of iftab, therefore more restrictive mapping should be
specified last.</p>

<p>INTERFACE NAME The first part of each mapping is an
interface name. If a network interface matches all
descriptors of a mapping, ifrename attempt to change the
name of the interface to the interface name given by the
mapping.</p>

<p>The interface name of a mapping is either a plain
interface name (such as eth2 or wlan1) or a interface name
pattern containing a single wild- card (such as eth* or
wlan*). In case of wildcard, the kernel replace the * with
the lowest available integer making this interface name
unique. Note that wildcard is only supported for kernel
2.6.1 and 2.4.30 and later.</p>

<p>It is discouraged to try to map interfaces to default
interfaces names such as eth0, wlan0 or ppp0. The kernel use
those as the default name for any new interface, therefore
most likely an interface will already use this name and
prevent ifrename to use it. Even if you use takeover, the
interface may already be up in some cases. Not using those
name will allow you to immediately spot unconfigured or new
interfaces. Good names are either totally unique and
meaningfull, such as mydsl or privatehub, or use larger
integer, such as eth5 or wlan5. The second type is usually
easier to integrate in various network utilities.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTORS Each descriptor is composed of a descriptor
name and descriptor value. Descriptors specify a static
attribute of a network interface, the goal is to uniquely
identify each piece of hardware.</p>

<p>Most users will only use the mac selector despite its
potential prob- lems, other selectors are for more
specialised setup. Most selectors accept a * in the selector
value for wilcard matching, and most selectors are case
insensitive.</p>

<p>mac mac address Matches the MAC Address of the interface
with the specified MAC address. The MAC address of the
interface can be shown using ifconfig(8) or ip(8). This is
the most common selector, as most interfaces have a unique
MAC address allowing to identify network interfaces with-
out ambiguity. However, some interfaces dont have a valid
MAC address until they are brought up, in such case using
this selector is tricky or impossible.</p>

<p>arp arp type Matches the ARP Type (also called Link
Type) of the interface with the specified ARP type as a
number. The ARP Type of the interface can be shown using
ifconfig(8) or ip(8), the link/ether type correspond to 1
and the link/ieee802.11 type correspond to 801. This
selector is useful when a driver create multiple network
interfaces for a single network card.</p>

<p>driver driver name Matches the Driver Name of the
interface with the specified driver name. The Driver Name of
the interface can be shown using ethtool -i(8).</p>

<p>businfo bus information Matches the Bus Information of
the interface with the specified bus information. The Bus
Information of the interface can be shown using ethtool
-i(8).</p>

<p>firmware firmware revision Matches the Firmware Revision
of the interface with the firmware revision information. The
Firmware Revision of the interface can be shown using
ethtool -i(8).</p>

<p>baseaddress base address Matches the Base Address of the
interface with the specified base address. The Base Address
of the interface can be shown using ifconfig(8). Because
most cards use dynamic allocation of the Base Address, this
selector is only useful for ISA and EISA cards.</p>

<p>irq irq line Matches the IRQ Line (interrupt) of the
interface with the spec- ified IRQ line. The IRQ Line of the
interface can be shown using ifconfig(8). Because there are
IRQ Lines may be shared, this selector is usu- ally not
sufficient to uniquely identify an interface.</p>

<p>iwproto wireless protocol Matches the Wireless Protocol
of the interface with the speci- fied wireless protocol. The
Wireless Protocol of the interface can be shown using
iwconfig(8) or iwgetid(8). This selector is only supported
on wireless interfaces and is not sufficient to uniquely
identify an interface.</p>

<p>pcmciaslot pcmcia slot Matches the Pcmcia Socket number
of the interface with the spec- ified slot number. Pcmcia
Socket number of the interface can be shown using cardctl
ident(8). This selector is usually only supported on 16 bits
cards, for 32 bits cards it is advised to use the selector
businfo.</p>

<p>prevname previous interface name Matches the name of the
interface prior to renaming with the specified oldname. This
selector should be avoided as the previous interface name
may vary depending on various condition. A
system/kernel/driver update may change the original name.
Then, ifrename or another tool may rename it prior to the
execution of this selector.</p>

<p>SYSFS{filename} value Matches the content the sysfs
attribute given by filename to the specified value. For
symlinks and parents directories, match the actual directory
name of the sysfs attribute given by filename to the
specified value. A list of the most useful sysfs attributes
is given in the next section.</p>

<p>SYSFS DESCRIPTORS Sysfs attributes for a specific
interface are located on most systems in the directory named
after that interface at /sys/class/net/. Most sysfs
attribute are files, and their values can be read using
cat(1) or more(1). It is also possible to match attributes
in subdirectories.</p>

<p>Some sysfs attributes are symlinks, pointing to another
directory in sysfs. If the attribute filename is a symlink
the sysfs attribute resolves to the name of the directory
pointed by the symlink using readlink(1). The location is a
directory in the sysfs tree is also important. If the
attribute filename ends with /.., the sysfs attribute
resolves to the real name of the parent directory using
pwd(1).</p>

<p>The sysfs filesystem is only supported with 2.6.X kernel
and need to be mounted (usually in /sys). sysfs selectors
are not as efficient as other selectors, therefore they
should be avoided for maximum perfor- mance.</p>

<p>These are common sysfs attributes and their
corresponding ifrename descriptors.</p>

<p>SYSFS{address} value Same as the mac descriptor.</p>

<p>SYSFS{type} value Same as the arp descriptor.</p>

<p>SYSFS{device} value Valid only up to kernel 2.6.20. Same
as the businfo descriptor.</p>

<p>SYSFS{..} value Valid only from kernel 2.6.21. Same as
the businfo descriptor.</p>

<p>SYSFS{device/driver} value Valid only up to kernel
2.6.20. Same as the driver descriptor.</p>

<p>SYSFS{../driver} value Valid only from kernel 2.6.21.
Same as the driver descriptor.</p>

<p>SYSFS{device/irq} value Valid only up to kernel 2.6.20.
Same as the irq descriptor.</p>

<p>SYSFS{../irq} value Valid only from kernel 2.6.21. Same
as the irq descriptor.</p>
