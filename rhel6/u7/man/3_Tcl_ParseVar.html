parsePtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ParseExpr(interp, start, numBytes, parsePtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ParseBraces(interp, start, numBytes, parsePtr,
append, termPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_ParseQuotedString(interp, start, numBytes,

<p>const char * Tcl_ParseVar(interp, start, termPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_FreeParse(usedParsePtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj * Tcl_EvalTokens(interp, tokenPtr,
numTokens)</p>

<p>int Tcl_EvalTokensStandard(interp, tokenPtr,
numTokens)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (out) For procedures other
than Tcl_FreeParse, Tcl_EvalTokens and
Tcl_EvalTokensStandard, used only for error reporting; if
NULL, then no error messages are left after errors. For
Tcl_EvalTokens and Tcl_EvalTo- kensStandard, determines the
context for evaluating the script and also is used for error
reporting; must not be NULL.</p>

<p>const char *start (in) Pointer to first character in
string to parse.</p>

<p>int numBytes (in) Number of bytes in string to parse,
not including any termi- nating null character. If less than
0 then the script consists of all characters following start
up to the first null char- acter.</p>

<p>int nested (in) Non-zero means that the script is part
of a command substitution so an unquoted close bracket
should be treated as a command terminator. If zero, close
brackets have no special meaning.</p>

<p>int append (in) Non-zero means that *parsePtr already
contains valid tokens; the new tokens should be appended to
those already present. Zero means that *parsePtr is
uninitialized; any information in it is ignored. This
argument is normally 0.</p>

<p>Tcl_Parse *parsePtr (out) Points to structure to fill in
with information about the parsed command, expression,
variable name, etc. Any previ- ous information in this
struc- ture is ignored, unless append is non-zero in a call
to Tcl_ParseBraces, Tcl_ParseQuot- edString, or
Tcl_ParseVarName.</p>

<p>const char **termPtr (out) If not NULL, points to a
loca- tion where Tcl_ParseBraces, Tcl_ParseQuotedString, and
Tcl_ParseVar will store a pointer to the character just
after the terminating character (the close-brace, the last
char- acter of the variable name, or the close-quote
(respectively)) if the parse was successful.</p>

<p>Tcl_Parse *usedParsePtr (in) Points to structure that
was filled in by a previous call to Tcl_ParseCommand,
Tcl_ParseExpr, Tcl_ParseVarName, etc.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures parse Tcl commands or
portions of Tcl commands such as expressions or references
to variables. Each procedure takes a pointer to a script (or
portion thereof) and fills in the structure pointed to by
parsePtr with a collection of tokens describing the
information that was parsed. The procedures normally return
TCL_OK. However, if an error occurs then they return
TCL_ERROR, leave an error message in interp s result (if
interp is not NULL), and leave nothing in parsePtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_ParseCommand is a procedure that parses Tcl scripts.
Given a pointer to a script, it parses the first command
from the script. If the command was parsed successfully,
Tcl_ParseCommand returns TCL_OK and fills in the structure
pointed to by parsePtr with information about the structure
of the command (see below for details). If an error occurred
in parsing the command then TCL_ERROR is returned, an error
message is left in interp s result, and no information is
left at *parsePtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_ParseExpr parses Tcl expressions. Given a pointer to
a script con- taining an expression, Tcl_ParseExpr parses
the expression. If the expression was parsed successfully,
Tcl_ParseExpr returns TCL_OK and fills in the structure
pointed to by parsePtr with information about the structure
of the expression (see below for details). If an error
occurred in parsing the command then TCL_ERROR is returned,
an error message is left in interps result, and no
information is left at *parsePtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_ParseBraces parses a string or command argument
enclosed in braces such as {hello} or {strint witt tabs}
from the beginning of its argument start. The first
character of start must be {. If the braced string was
parsed successfully, Tcl_ParseBraces returns TCL_OK, fills
in the structure pointed to by parsePtr with information
about the structure of the string (see below for details),
and stores a pointer to the character just after the
terminating } in the location given by *termPtr. If an error
occurs while parsing the string then TCL_ERROR is returned,
an error message is left in interp s result, and no infor-
mation is left at *parsePtr or *termPtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_ParseQuotedString parses a double-quoted string such
as &quot;sum is [expr {$a+$b}]&quot; from the beginning of
the argument start. The first character of start must be
&quot;. If the double-quoted string was parsed successfully,
Tcl_ParseQuotedString returns TCL_OK, fills in the struc-
ture pointed to by parsePtr with information about the
structure of the string (see below for details), and stores
a pointer to the character just after the terminating &quot;
in the location given by *termPtr. If an error occurs while
parsing the string then TCL_ERROR is returned, an error
message is left in interp s result, and no information is
left at *parsePtr or *termPtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_ParseVarName parses a Tcl variable reference such as
$abc or $x([expr {$index + 1}]) from the beginning of its
start argument. The first character of start must be $. If a
variable name was parsed suc- cessfully, Tcl_ParseVarName
returns TCL_OK and fills in the structure pointed to by
parsePtr with information about the structure of the
variable name (see below for details). If an error occurs
while pars- ing the command then TCL_ERROR is returned, an
error message is left in interps result (if interp is not
NULL), and no information is left at *parsePtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_ParseVar parse a Tcl variable reference such as $abc
or $x([expr {$index + 1}]) from the beginning of its start
argument. The first character of start must be $. If the
variable name is parsed success- fully, Tcl_ParseVar returns
a pointer to the string value of the vari- able. If an error
occurs while parsing, then NULL is returned and an error
message is left in interps result.</p>

<p>The information left at *parsePtr by Tcl_ParseCommand,
Tcl_ParseExpr, Tcl_ParseBraces, Tcl_ParseQuotedString, and
Tcl_ParseVarName may include dynamically allocated memory.
If these five parsing procedures return TCL_OK then the
caller must invoke Tcl_FreeParse to release the storage at
*parsePtr. These procedures ignore any existing information
in *parsePtr (unless append is non-zero), so if repeated
calls are being made to any of them then Tcl_FreeParse must
be invoked once after each call.</p>

<p>Tcl_EvalTokensStandard evaluates a sequence of parse
tokens from a Tcl_Parse structure. The tokens typically
consist of all the tokens in a word or all the tokens that
make up the index for a reference to an array variable.
Tcl_EvalTokensStandard performs the substitutions requested
by the tokens and concatenates the resulting values. The
return value from Tcl_EvalTokensStandard is a Tcl completion
code with one of the values TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR, TCL_RETURN,
TCL_BREAK, or TCL_CON- TINUE, or possibly some other integer
value originating in an exten- sion. In addition, a result
value or error message is left in interps result; it can be
retrieved using Tcl_GetObjResult.</p>

<p>Tcl_EvalTokens differs from Tcl_EvalTokensStandard only
in the return convention used: it returns the result in a
new Tcl_Obj. The reference count of the object returned as
result has been incremented, so the caller must invoke
Tcl_DecrRefCount when it is finished with the object. If an
error or other exception occurs while evaluating the tokens
(such as a reference to a non-existent variable) then the
return value is NULL and an error message is left in interps
result. The use of Tcl_EvalTokens is deprecated.</p>

<p>TCL_PARSE STRUCTURE Tcl_ParseCommand, Tcl_ParseExpr,
Tcl_ParseBraces, Tcl_ParseQuoted- String, and
Tcl_ParseVarName return parse information in two data
structures, Tcl_Parse and Tcl_Token: typedef struct
Tcl_Parse { const char *commentStart; int commentSize; const
char *commandStart; int commandSize; int numWords; Tcl_Token
*tokenPtr; int numTokens; ... } Tcl_Parse;</p>

<p>typedef struct Tcl_Token { int type; const char *start;
int size; int numComponents; } Tcl_Token;</p>

<p>The first five fields of a Tcl_Parse structure are
filled in only by Tcl_ParseCommand. These fields are not
used by the other parsing pro- cedures.</p>

<p>Tcl_ParseCommand fills in a Tcl_Parse structure with
information that describes one Tcl command and any comments
that precede the command. If there are comments, the
commentStart field points to the # character that begins the
first comment and commentSize indicates the number of bytes
in all of the comments preceding the command, including the
new- line character that terminates the last comment. If the
command is not preceded by any comments, commentSize is 0.
Tcl_ParseCommand also sets the commandStart field to point
to the first character of the first word in the command
(skipping any comments and leading space) and com- mandSize
gives the total number of bytes in the command, including
the character pointed to by commandStart up to and including
the newline, close bracket, or semicolon character that
terminates the command. The numWords field gives the total
number of words in the command.</p>

<p>All parsing procedures set the remaining fields,
tokenPtr and numTo- kens. The tokenPtr field points to the
first in an array of Tcl_Token structures that describe the
components of the entity being parsed. The numTokens field
gives the total number of tokens present in the array. Each
token contains four fields. The type field selects one of
several token types that are described below. The start
field points to the first character in the token and the
size field gives the total number of characters in the
token. Some token types, such as TCL_TOKEN_WORD and
TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE, consist of several component tokens,
which immediately follow the parent token; the numComponents
field describes how many of these there are. The type field
has one of the following values:</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_WORD This token ordinarily describes one word
of a com- mand but it may also describe a quoted or braced
string in an expression. The token describes a component of
the script that is the result of con- catenating together a
sequence of subcomponents, each described by a separate
subtoken. The token starts with the first non-blank
character of the component (which may be a double-quote or
open brace) and includes all characters in the component up
to but not including the space, semicolon, close bracket,
close quote, or close brace that termi- nates the component.
The numComponents field counts the total number of
sub-tokens that make up the word, including sub-tokens of
TCL_TOKEN_VARI- ABLE and TCL_TOKEN_BS tokens.</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD This token has the same meaning as
TCL_TOKEN_WORD, except that the word is guaranteed to
consist of a single TCL_TOKEN_TEXT sub-token. The
numComponents field is always 1.</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD This token has the same meaning as
TCL_TOKEN_WORD, except that the command parser notes this
word began with the expansion prefix {*}, indicating that
after substitution, the list value of this word should be
expanded to form multiple arguments in command evaluation.
This token type can only be created by Tcl_ParseCommand.</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_TEXT The token describes a range of literal
text that is part of a word. The numComponents field is
always 0.</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_BS The token describes a backslash sequence
such asn or0xa3. The numComponents field is always 0.</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND The token describes a command whose
result must be substituted into the word. The token includes
the square brackets that surround the command. The
numComponents field is always 0 (the nested command is not
parsed; call Tcl_ParseCommand recursively if you want to see
its tokens).</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE The token describes a variable
substitution, including the $, variable name, and array
index (if there is one) up through the close parenthesis
that terminates the index. This token is followed by one or
more additional tokens that describe the variable name and
array index. If numComponents is 1 then the variable is a
scalar and the next token is a TCL_TOKEN_TEXT token that
gives the variable name. If numComponents is greater than 1
then the variable is an array: the first sub-token is a
TCL_TOKEN_TEXT token giving the array name and the remaining
sub-tokens are TCL_TOKEN_TEXT, TCL_TOKEN_BS,
TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND, and TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE tokens that must
be concatenated to produce the array index. The
numComponents field includes nested sub-tokens that are part
of TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE tokens in the array index.</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR The token describes one subexpression
of an expres- sion (or an entire expression). A
subexpression may consist of a value such as an integer
literal, variable substitution, or parenthesized subexpres-
sion; it may also consist of an operator and its operands.
The token starts with the first non- blank character of the
subexpression up to but not including the space, brace,
close-paren, or bracket that terminates the subexpression.
This token is followed by one or more additional tokens that
describe the subexpression. If the first sub-token after the
TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR token is a TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR token, the
subexpression consists of an operator and its token
operands. If the operator has no operands, the subexpression
consists of just the TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR token. Each operand
is described by a TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR token. Otherwise, the
subexpression is a value described by one of the token types
TCL_TOKEN_WORD, TCL_TOKEN_TEXT, TCL_TOKEN_BS,
TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND, TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE, and
TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR. The numComponents field counts the total
number of sub- tokens that make up the subexpression; this
includes the sub-tokens for any nested TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR
tokens.</p>

<p>TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR The token describes one operator of
an expression such as &amp;&amp; or hypot. A
TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR token is always preceded by a
TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR token that describes the operator and its
operands; the TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR token s numComponents field
can be used to determine the number of operands. A binary
operator such as * is followed by two TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR
tokens that describe its operands. A unary operator like -
is followed by a single TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR token for its
operand. If the operator is a math function such as log10,
the TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR token will give its name and the
following TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR tokens will describe its
operands; if there are no operands (as with rand), no
TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR tokens follow. There is one trinary
operator, ?, that appears in if-then-else subexpressions
such as x?y:z; in this case, the ? TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR token
is followed by three TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR tokens for the
operands x, y, and z. The numComponents field for a
TCL_TOKEN_OPERATOR token is always 0.</p>

<p>After Tcl_ParseCommand returns, the first token pointed
to by the tokenPtr field of the Tcl_Parse structure always
has type TCL_TOKEN_WORD or TCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD or
TCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD. It is followed by the sub-tokens that
must be concatenated to produce the value of that word. The
next token is the TCL_TOKEN_WORD or TCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORD of
TCL_TOKEN_EXPAND_WORD token for the second word, followed by
sub-tokens for that word, and so on until all num- Words
have been accounted for.</p>

<p>After Tcl_ParseExpr returns, the first token pointed to
by the tokenPtr field of the Tcl_Parse structure always has
type TCL_TOKEN_SUB_EXPR. It is followed by the sub-tokens
that must be evaluated to produce the value of the
expression. Only the token information in the Tcl_Parse
structure is modified: the commentStart, commentSize,
commandStart, and commandSize fields are not modified by
Tcl_ParseExpr.</p>

<p>After Tcl_ParseBraces returns, the array of tokens
pointed to by the tokenPtr field of the Tcl_Parse structure
will contain a single TCL_TOKEN_TEXT token if the braced
string does not contain any back- slash-newlines. If the
string does contain backslash-newlines, the array of tokens
will contain one or more TCL_TOKEN_TEXT or TCL_TOKEN_BS
sub-tokens that must be concatenated to produce the value of
the string. If the braced string was just {} (that is, the
string was empty), the single TCL_TOKEN_TEXT token will have
a size field contain- ing zero; this ensures that at least
one token appears to describe the braced string. Only the
token information in the Tcl_Parse structure is modified:
the commentStart, commentSize, commandStart, and command-
Size fields are not modified by Tcl_ParseBraces.</p>

<p>After Tcl_ParseQuotedString returns, the array of tokens
pointed to by the tokenPtr field of the Tcl_Parse structure
depends on the contents of the quoted string. It will
consist of one or more TCL_TOKEN_TEXT, TCL_TOKEN_BS,
TCL_TOKEN_COMMAND, and TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE sub-tokens. The
array always contains at least one token; for example, if
the argu- ment start is empty, the array returned consists
of a single TCL_TOKEN_TEXT token with a zero size field.
Only the token informa- tion in the Tcl_Parse structure is
modified: the commentStart, comment- Size, commandStart, and
commandSize fields are not modified.</p>

<p>After Tcl_ParseVarName returns, the first token pointed
to by the tokenPtr field of the Tcl_Parse structure always
has type TCL_TOKEN_VARIABLE. It is followed by the
sub-tokens that make up the variable name as described
above. The total length of the variable name is contained in
the size field of the first token. As in Tcl_ParseExpr, only
the token information in the Tcl_Parse structure is modified
by Tcl_ParseVarName: the commentStart, commentSize, command-
Start, and commandSize fields are not modified.</p>

<p>All of the character pointers in the Tcl_Parse and
Tcl_Token structures refer to characters in the start
argument passed to Tcl_ParseCommand, Tcl_ParseExpr,
Tcl_ParseBraces, Tcl_ParseQuotedString, and Tcl_Parse-
VarName.</p>

<p>There are additional fields in the Tcl_Parse structure
after the numTo- kens field, but these are for the private
use of Tcl_ParseCommand, Tcl_ParseExpr, Tcl_ParseBraces,
Tcl_ParseQuotedString, and Tcl_Parse- VarName; they should
not be referenced by code outside of these proce- dures.</p>
