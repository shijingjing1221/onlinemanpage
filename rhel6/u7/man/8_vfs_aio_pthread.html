<p>NAME vfs_aio_pthread - implement async I/O in Samba vfs
using a pthread pool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = aio_pthread</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The aio_pthread VFS module enables asynchronous I/O for
Samba on platforms which have the pthreads API available,
without using the Posix AIO interface. Posix AIO can suffer
from severe limitations. For example, on some Linux versions
the real-time signals that it uses are broken under heavy
load. Other systems only allow AIO when special kernel
modules are loaded or only allow a certain system-wide
amount of async requests being scheduled. Systems based on
glibc (most Linux systems) only allow a single outstanding
request per file descriptor which essentially makes Posix
AIO useless on systems using the glibc implementation.</p>

<p>To work around all these limitations, the aio_pthread
module was written. It uses a pthread pool instead of the
internal Posix AIO interface to allow read and write calls
to be process asynchronously. A pthread pool is created
which expands dynamically by creating new threads as work is
given to it to a maximum of 100 threads per smbd process. To
change this limit see the &quot;aio num threads&quot;
parameter below. New threads are not created if idle threads
are available when a new read or write request is received,
the new work is given to an existing idle thread. Threads
terminate themselves if idle for one second.</p>

<p>Note that the smb.conf parameters aio read size and aio
write size must also be set appropriately for this module to
be active.</p>

<p>This module MUST be listed last in any module stack as
the Samba VFS pread/pwrite interface is not thread-safe.
This module makes direct pread and pwrite system calls and
does NOT call the Samba VFS pread and pwrite interfaces.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Straight forward use:</p>

<p>[cooldata] path = /data/ice aio read size = 1024 aio
write size = 1024 vfs objects = aio_pthread</p>

<p>OPTIONS aio_pthread:aio num threads = INTEGER Limit the
maximum number of threads per smbd that will be created in
the thread pool to service IO requests.</p>

<p>By default this is set to 100.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.6.3 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
