<p>Tcl_RegisterConfig(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_RegisterConfig(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_RegisterConfig - procedures to register
embedded configuration information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>void Tcl_RegisterConfig(interp, pkgName, configuration,
valEncoding)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Refers to the
interpreter the embedded configuration informa- tion is
registered for. Must not be NULL.</p>

<p>const char *pkgName (in) Contains the name of the pack-
age registering the embedded configuration as ASCII string.
This means that this informa- tion is in UTF-8 too. Must not
be NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_Config *configuration (in) Refers to an array of
Tcl_Con- fig entries containing the information embedded in
the binary library. Must not be NULL. The end of the array
is signaled by either a key iden- tical to NULL, or a key
refer- ring to the empty string.</p>

<p>const char *valEncoding (in) Contains the name of the
encod- ing used to store the configu- ration values as ASCII
string. This means that this informa- tion is in UTF-8 too.
Must not be NULL.

<p>DESCRIPTION The function described here has its base in
TIP 59 and provides exten- sions with support for the
embedding of configuration information into their binary
library and the generation of a Tcl-level interface for
querying this information.</p>

<p>To embed configuration information into their binary
library an exten- sion has to define a non-volatile array of
Tcl_Config entries in one if its source files and then call
Tcl_RegisterConfig to register that information.</p>

<p>Tcl_RegisterConfig takes four arguments; first, a
reference to the interpreter we are registering the
information with, second, the name of the package
registering its configuration information, third, a pointer
to an array of structures, and fourth a string declaring the
encoding used by the configuration values.</p>

<p>The string valEncoding contains the name of an encoding
known to Tcl. All these names are use only characters in the
ASCII subset of UTF-8 and are thus implicitly in the UTF-8
encoding. It is expected that keys are legible English text
and therefore using the ASCII subset of UTF-8. In other
words, they are expected to be in UTF-8 too. The values
asso- ciated with the keys can be any string however. For
these the contents of valEncoding define which encoding was
used to represent the charac- ters of the strings.</p>

<p>Each element of the configuration array refers to two
strings contain- ing the key and the value associated with
that key. The end of the array is signaled by either an
empty key or a key identical to NULL. The function makes no
copy of the configuration array. This means that the caller
has to make sure that the memory holding this array is never
released. This is the meaning behind the word non-volatile
used ear- lier. The easiest way to accomplish this is to
define a global static array of Tcl_Config entries. See the
file generic/tclPkgConfig.c in the sources of the Tcl core
for an example.</p>

<p>When called Tcl_RegisterConfig will</p>

<p>(1) create a namespace having the provided pkgName, if
not yet existing.</p>

<p>(2) create the command pkgconfig in that namespace and
link it to the provided information so that the keys from
_configuration_ and their associated values can be retrieved
through calls to pkgconfig.</p>

<p>The command pkgconfig will provide two subcommands, list
and get:</p>

<p>::pkgName::pkgconfig list Returns a list containing the
names of all defined keys.</p>

<p>::pkgName::pkgconfig get key Returns the configuration
value associated with the spec- ified key.</p>

<p>TCL_CONFIG The Tcl_Config structure contains the
following fields:</p>

<p>typedef struct Tcl_Config { const char* key; const char*
value; } Tcl_Config;</p>
