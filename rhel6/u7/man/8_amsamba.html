<p>NAME amsamba - Amanda Application to interface with
smbclient</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amsamba is an Amanda Application API script.
It should not be run by users directly. It uses smbclient to
backup and restore data.</p>

<p>The device name in the disklist must have the form
&acute;//HOST/SHARE/SUBDIR&acute; where HOST is the CIFS
host, SHARE is the share to connect and subdir is the
subdirectory to backup. &acute;/subdir&acute; can be
ommited, in which case the complete share is archived. The
host in the disklist should be the name of an intermediate
host that has smbclient installed, and is often the Amanda
server itself.</p>

<p>Include or exclude can be used, but not both. The path
for &acute;exclude list&acute; or &acute;include list&acute;
must be absolute path on the client. The estimate calculates
the complete size of the share, without regard for include
or exclude directives. It will be larger than the actual
dump if you use include or exclude. Using &acute;estimate
server&acute; in the dumptype could give better
estimate.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES This section lists the properties that
control amsamba&acute;s functionality. See
amanda-applications(7) for information on application
properties and how they are configured.</p>

<p>SMBCLIENT-PATH</p>

<p>The path to the smbclient binary. The default is set
when Amanda is built.</p>

<p>GNUTAR-PATH</p>

<p>The path to the gnutar binary. The default is set when
Amanda is built. gnutar is use to create the index.</p>

<p>AMANDAPASS</p>

<p>Location of the amandapass file, The default is
&quot;/etc/amandapass&quot;. The format of the file is as
follow: Sharename User%Password Domain</p>

<p>Sharename is &acute;//HOST/SHARE&acute; without the
SUBDIR. Sharename can be quoted, it can be &acute;*&acute;
to match all share, it can be &acute;//pc-host/*&acute; to
match all share on pc-host. User is the username use to
connect to the share. Password is the password use to
connect to the share. Domain is optional. Example:
//another-pc/share otheruser%otherpw domain</p>
