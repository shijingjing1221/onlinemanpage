<p>DUMPKEYS(1) DUMPKEYS(1)</p>

<p>NAME dumpkeys - dump keyboard translation tables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dumpkeys [ -hilfn -ccharset --help --short-info
--long-info --numeric --full-table --funcs-only --keys-only
--compose-only --charset=charset ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dumpkeys writes, to the standard output, the
current contents of the keyboard driver s translation
tables, in the format specified by keymaps(5).</p>

<p>Using the various options, the format of the output can
be controlled and also other information from the kernel and
the programs dumpkeys(1) and loadkeys(1) can be
obtained.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h --help Prints the programs version number and
a short usage message to the programs standard error output
and exits.</p>

<p>-i --short-info Prints some characteristics of the
kernels keyboard driver. The items shown are:</p>

<p>Keycode range supported by the kernel</p>

<p>This tells what values can be used after the keycode
key- word in keytable files. See keymaps(5) for more
informa- tion and the syntax of these files.</p>

<p>Number of actions bindable to a key</p>

<p>This tells how many different actions a single key can
output using various modifier keys. If the value is 16 for
example, you can define up to 16 different actions to a key
combined with modifiers. When the value is 16, the kernel
probably knows about four modifier keys, which you can press
in different combinations with the key to access all the
bound actions.</p>

<p>Ranges of action codes supported by the kernel</p>

<p>This item contains a list of action code ranges in hex-
adecimal notation. These are the values that can be used in
the right hand side of a key definition, ie. the vvs in a
line</p>

<p>keycode xx = vv vv vv vv</p>

<p>(see keymaps(5) for more information about the format of
key definition lines). dumpkeys(1) and loadkeys(1) sup- port
a symbolic notation, which is preferable to the numeric one,
as the action codes may vary from kernel to kernel while the
symbolic names usually remain the same. However, the list of
action code ranges can be used to determine, if the kernel
actually supports all the sym- bols loadkeys(1) knows, or
are there maybe some actions supported by the kernel that
have no symbolic name in your loadkeys(1) program. To see
this, you compare the range list with the action symbol
list, see option --long-info below.</p>

<p>Number of function keys supported by kernel</p>

<p>This tells the number of action codes that can be used
to output strings of characters. These action codes are tra-
ditionally bound to the various function and editing keys of
the keyboard and are defined to send standard escape
sequences. However, you can redefine these to send common
command lines, email addresses or whatever you like.
Especially if the number of this item is greater than the
number of function and editing keys in your keyboard, you
may have some &quot;spare&quot; action codes that you can
bind to AltGr-letter combinations, for example, to send some
use- ful strings. See loadkeys(1) for more details.</p>

<p>Function strings</p>

<p>You can see you current function key definitions with
the command</p>

<p>dumpkeys --funcs-only</p>

<p>-l --long-info This option instructs dumpkeys to print a
long information list- ing. The output is the same as with
the --short-info appended with the list of action symbols
supported by loadkeys(1) and dumpkeys(1), along with the
symbols numeric values.</p>

<p>-n --numeric This option causes dumpkeys to by-pass the
conversion of action code values to symbolic notation and to
print the in hexadecimal format instead.</p>

<p>-f --full-table This makes dumpkeys skip all the
short-hand heuristics (see keymaps(5)) and output the key
bindings in the canonical form. First a keymaps line
describing the currently defined modifier combinations is
printed. Then for each key a row with a column for each
modifier combination is printed. For example, if the current
keymap in use uses seven modifiers, every row will have
seven action code columns. This format can be useful for
example to programs that post-process the output of
dumpkeys.</p>

<p>--funcs-only When this option is given, dumpkeys prints
only the function key string definitions. Normally dumpkeys
prints both the key bind- ings and the string
definitions.</p>

<p>--keys-only When this option is given, dumpkeys prints
only the key bind- ings. Normally dumpkeys prints both the
key bindings and the string definitions.</p>

<p>--compose-only When this option is given, dumpkeys
prints only the compose key combinations. This option is
available only if your kernel has compose key support.</p>

<p>-ccharset --charset=charset This instructs dumpkeys to
interpret character code values according to the specified
character set. This affects only the translation of
character code values to symbolic names. Valid values for
charset currently are iso-8859-X, Where X is a digit in 1-9.
If no charset is specified, iso-8859-1 is used as a default.
This option produces an output line charset
&quot;iso-8859-X&quot;, telling loadkeys how to interpret
the keymap. (For example, &quot;division&quot; is 0xf7 in
iso-8859-1 but 0xba in iso-8859-8.)</p>
