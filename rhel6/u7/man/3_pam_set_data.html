<p>PAM_SET_DATA(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_SET_DATA(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_set_data - set module internal data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_set_data(pam_handle_t *pamh, const char
*module_data_name, void *data, void (*cleanup)(pam_handle_t
*pamh, void *data, int error_status));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_set_data function associates a
pointer to an object with the (hopefully) unique string
module_data_name in the PAM context specified by the pamh
argument.</p>

<p>PAM modules may be dynamically loadable objects. In
general such files should not contain static variables. This
function and its counterpart pam_get_data(3), provide a
mechanism for a module to associate some data with the
handle pamh. Typically a module will call the pam_set_data
function to register some data under a (hopefully) unique
module_data_name. The data is available for use by other
modules too but not by an application. Since this functions
stores only a pointer to the data, the module should not
modify or free the content of it.</p>

<p>The function cleanup() is associated with the data and,
if non-NULL, it is called when this data is over-written or
following a call to pam_end(3).</p>

<p>The error_status argument is used to indicate to the
module the sort of action it is to take in cleaning this
data item. As an example, Kerberos creates a ticket file
during the authentication phase, this file might be
associated with a data item. When pam_end(3) is called by
the module, the error_status carries the return value of the
pam_authenticate(3) or other libpam function as appropriate.
Based on this value the Kerberos module may choose to delete
the ticket file (authentication failure) or leave it in
place.</p>

<p>The error_status may have been logically OR&acute;d with
either of the following two values:</p>

<p>PAM_DATA_REPLACE When a data item is being replaced
(through a second call to pam_set_data) this mask is used.
Otherwise, the call is assumed to be from pam_end(3).</p>

<p>PAM_DATA_SILENT Which indicates that the process would
prefer to perform the cleanup() quietly. That is,
discourages logging/messages to the user.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS Data was successful stored.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR A NULL pointer was submitted as PAM
handle or the function was called by an application.</p>
