<p>Xvnc(1) Virtual Network Computing Xvnc(1)</p>

<p>NAME Xvnc - the X VNC server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Xvnc [options] :display#</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xvnc is the X VNC (Virtual Network
Computing) server. It is based on a standard X server, but
it has a &quot;virtual&quot; screen rather than a physical
one. X applications display themselves on it as if it were a
normal X display, but they can only be accessed via a VNC
viewer - see vncviewer(1).</p>

<p>So Xvnc is really two servers in one. To the
applications it is an X server, and to the remote VNC users
it is a VNC server. By convention we have arranged that the
VNC server display number will be the same as the X server
display number, which means you can use eg. snoopy:2 to
refer to display 2 on machine &quot;snoopy&quot; in both the
X world and the VNC world.</p>

<p>The best way of starting Xvnc is via the vncserver
script. This sets up the environment appropriately and runs
some X applications to get you going. See the manual page
for vncserver(1) for more information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Xvnc takes lots of options - running Xvnc -help
gives a list. Many of these are standard X server options,
which are described in the Xserver(1) manual page. In
addition to options which can only be set via the
command-line, there are also &quot;parameters&quot; which
can be set both via the command-line and through the
vncconfig(1) program.</p>

<p>-geometry widthxheight Specify the size of the desktop
to be created. Default is 1024x768.</p>

<p>-depth depth Specify the pixel depth in bits of the
desktop to be created. Default is 24, other possible values
are 8, 15, and 16 - any- thing else is likely to cause
strange behaviour by applications.</p>

<p>-pixelformat format Specify pixel format for server to
use (BGRnnn or RGBnnn). The default for depth 8 is BGR233
(meaning the most significant two bits represent blue, the
next three green, and the least signif- icant three
represent red), the default for depth 16 is RGB565 and for
depth 24 is RGB888.</p>

<p>-interface IP address or -i IP address Listen on
interface. By default Xvnc listens on all available
interfaces.</p>

<p>-cc 3 As an alternative to the default TrueColor visual,
this allows you to run an Xvnc server with a PseudoColor
visual (i.e. one which uses a color map or palette), which
can be useful for run- ning some old X applications which
only work on such a display. Values other than 3
(PseudoColor) and 4 (TrueColor) for the -cc option may
result in strange behaviour, and PseudoColor desktops must
be 8 bits deep (i.e. -depth 8).</p>

<p>-inetd This significantly changes Xvncs behaviour so
that it can be launched from inetd. See the section below on
usage with inetd.</p>

<p>-help List all the options and parameters</p>

<p>PARAMETERS VNC parameters can be set both via the
command-line and through the vncconfig(1) program, and with
a VNC-enabled Xorg server via Options entries in the
xorg.conf file.</p>

<p>Parameters can be turned on with -param or off with
-param=0. Parame- ters which take a value can be specified
as -param value. Other valid forms are param=value
-param=value --param=value. Parameter names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p>-desktop desktop-name Each desktop has a name which may
be displayed by the viewer. It defaults to
&quot;x11&quot;.</p>

<p>-rfbport port Specifies the TCP port on which Xvnc
listens for connections from viewers (the protocol used in
VNC is called RFB - &quot;remote framebuffer&quot;). The
default is 5900 plus the display number.</p>

<p>-rfbwait time, -ClientWaitTimeMillis time</p>

<p>Time in milliseconds to wait for a viewer which is
blocking Xvnc. This is necessary because Xvnc is
single-threaded and sometimes blocks until the viewer has
finished sending or receiving a message - note that this
does not mean an update will be aborted after this time.
Default is 20000 (20 seconds).</p>

<p>-httpd directory Run a mini-HTTP server which serves
files from the given direc- tory. Normally the directory
will contain the classes for the Java viewer. In addition,
files with a .vnc extension will have certain substitutions
made so that a single installation of the Java VNC viewer
can be served by separate instances of Xvnc.</p>

<p>-httpPort port Specifies the port on which the mini-HTTP
server runs. Default is 5800 plus the display number.</p>

<p>-rfbauth passwd-file, -PasswordFile passwd-file
Specifies the file containing the password used to
authenticate viewers. The file is accessed each time a
connection comes in, so it can be changed on the fly via
vncpasswd(1).</p>

<p>-deferUpdate time Xvnc uses a &quot;deferred
update&quot; mechanism which enhances perfor- mance in many
cases. After any change to the framebuffer, Xvnc waits for
this number of milliseconds (default 1) before sending an
update to any waiting clients. This means that more changes
tend to get coalesced together in a single update. Setting
it to 0 results in the same behaviour as earlier versions of
Xvnc, where the first change to the framebuffer causes an
immediate update to any waiting clients.</p>

<p>-SendCutText Send clipboard changes to clients (default
is on). Note that you must also run vncconfig(1) to get the
clipboard to work.</p>

<p>-AcceptCutText Accept clipboard updates from clients
(default is on). Note that you must also run vncconfig(1) to
get the clipboard to work.</p>

<p>-AcceptPointerEvents Accept pointer press and release
events from clients (default is on).</p>

<p>-AcceptKeyEvents Accept key press and release events
from clients (default is on).</p>

<p>-DisconnectClients Disconnect existing clients if an
incoming connection is non- shared (default is on). If
DisconnectClients is false, then a new non-shared connection
will be refused while there is a client active. When
combined with NeverShared this means only one client is
allowed at a time.</p>

<p>-NeverShared Never treat incoming connections as shared,
regardless of the client-specified setting (default is
off).</p>

<p>-AlwaysShared Always treat incoming connections as
shared, regardless of the client-specified setting (default
is off).</p>

<p>-Protocol3.3 Always use protocol version 3.3 for
backwards compatibility with badly-behaved clients (default
is off).</p>

<p>-CompareFB Perform pixel comparison on framebuffer to
reduce unnecessary updates (default is on).</p>

<p>-SecurityTypes sec-types Specify which security schemes
to use separated by commas. At present only &quot;None&quot;
and &quot;VncAuth&quot; are supported. The default is
&quot;VncAuth&quot; - note that if you want a server which
does not require a password, you must set this parameter to
&quot;None&quot;.</p>

<p>-IdleTimeout seconds The number of seconds after which
an idle VNC connection will be dropped (default is 0, which
means that idle connections will never be dropped).</p>

<p>-QueryConnect Prompts the user of the desktop to
explicitly accept or reject incoming connections. This is
most useful when using the vnc.so module or x0vncserver(1)
program to access an existing X desktop via VNC.</p>

<p>The vncconfig(1) program must be running on the desktop
in order for QueryConnect to be supported by the vnc.so(1)
module or Xvnc(1) program. The x0vncserver(1) program does
not require vncconfig(1) to be running.</p>

<p>-localhost Only allow connections from the same machine.
Useful if you use SSH and want to stop non-SSH connections
from any other hosts. See the guide to using VNC with SSH on
the web site.</p>

<p>-log logname:dest:level Configures the debug log
settings. dest can currently be stderr or stdout, and level
is between 0 and 100, 100 meaning most ver- bose output.
logname is usually * meaning all, but you can tar- get a
specific source file if you know the name of its &quot;Log-
Writer&quot;. Default is *:stderr:30.</p>

<p>-RemapKeys mapping Sets up a keyboard mapping. mapping
is a comma-separated string of character mappings, each of
the form char-&gt;char, or char&lt;&gt;char, where char is a
hexadecimal keysym. For example, to exchange the &quot; and
@ symbols you would specify the following:</p>

<p>RemapKeys=0x22&lt;&gt;0x40</p>

<p>-SecurityTypes security-type Comma-separated list of
which security type(s) to use. Types include VeNCrypt,
X509Plain, TLSPlain, X509Vnc, TLSVnc, X509None, TLSNone,
VncAuth, None. The list must start with VeNCrypt for the
X509 and TLS types. For example,
-SecurityTypes=VeNCrypt,TLSVnc</p>

<p>Description of options:</p>

<p>VeNCrypt enable X509 and TLS options</p>

<p>X509Plain X.509 encryption with Plain authentication</p>

<p>TLSPlain TLS encryption with Plain authentication</p>

<p>X509Vnc X.509 encryption with VNC password
authentication</p>

<p>TLSVnc TLS encryption with VNC password
authentication</p>

<p>X509None X.509 encryption with no authentication</p>

<p>TLSNone TLS encryption with no authentication</p>

<p>VNCAuth VNC password authencation (no encryption)</p>

<p>None No authentication, no encryption</p>

<p>USAGE WITH INETD By configuring the inetd(1) service
appropriately, Xvnc can be launched on demand when a
connection comes in, rather than having to be started
manually. When given the -inetd option, instead of listening
for TCP connections on a given port it uses its standard
input and standard output. There are two modes controlled by
the wait/nowait entry in the inetd.conf file.</p>

<p>In the nowait mode, Xvnc uses its standard input and
output directly as the connection to a viewer. It never has
a listening socket, so cannot accept further connections
from viewers (it can however connect out to listening
viewers by use of the vncconfig program). Further viewer
connections to the same TCP port result in inetd spawning
off a new Xvnc to deal with each connection. When the
connection to the viewer dies, the Xvnc and any associated X
clients die. This behaviour is most useful when combined
with the XDMCP options -query and -once. An typical example
in inetd.conf might be (all on one line):</p>

<p>5950 stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/local/bin/Xvnc Xvnc
-inetd -query localhost -once securitytypes=none</p>

<p>In this example a viewer connection to :50 will result
in a new Xvnc for that connection which should display the
standard XDM login screen on that machine. Because the user
needs to login via XDM, it is usu- ally OK to accept
connections without a VNC password in this case.</p>

<p>In the wait mode, when the first connection comes in,
inetd gives the listening socket to Xvnc. This means that
for a given TCP port, there is only ever one Xvnc at a time.
Further viewer connections to the same port are accepted by
the same Xvnc in the normal way. Even when the original
connection is broken, the Xvnc will continue to run. If this
is used with the XDMCP options -query and -once, the Xvnc
and associated X clients will die when the user logs out of
the X session in the normal way. It is important to use a
VNC password in this case. A typical entry in inetd.conf
might be:</p>

<p>5951 stream tcp wait james /usr/local/bin/Xvnc Xvnc
-inetd -query localhost -once
passwordFile=/home/james/.vnc/passwd</p>

<p>In fact typically, you would have one entry for each
user who uses VNC regularly, each of whom has their own
dedicated TCP port which they use. In this example, when
user &quot;james&quot; connects to :51, he enters his VNC
password, then gets the XDM login screen where he logs in in
the normal way. However, unlike the previous example, if he
disconnects, the session remains persistent, and when he
reconnects he will get the same session back again. When he
logs out of the X session, the Xvnc will die, but of course
a new one will be created automatically the next time he
connects.</p>
