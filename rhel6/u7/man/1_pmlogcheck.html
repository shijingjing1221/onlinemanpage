<p>NAME pmlogcheck - checks for invalid data in a PCP
archive</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmlogcheck [-lz] [-n pmnsfile] [-S start] [-T
finish] [-Z timezone] archive</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmlogcheck prints information about the
nature of any invalid data which it detects in a PCP
archive. Of particular interest are wrapped values for
metrics which are expected to have monotonically increasing
values. The archive has the base name archive and must have
been pre- viously created using pmlogger(1).</p>

<p>Normally pmlogcheck operates on the default Performance
Metrics Name Space (pmns(5)), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative namespace is loaded from the file
pmnsfile.</p>

<p>The command line options -S and -T can be used to
specify a time window over which metrics should be
summarized. These options are common to many Performance
Co-Pilot tools and are fully described in PCPIntro(1).</p>

<p>The -l option prints the archive label, showing the log
format version, the time and date for the start and
(current) end of the archive, and the host from which the
performance metrics values were collected.</p>

<p>By default, pmlogcheck reports the time of day according
to the local timezone on the system where pmlogcheck is run.
The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(5).
The -z option changes the timezone to the local timezone at
the host that is the source of the performance met- rics, as
specified in the label record of the archive log.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMAT For each metric having counter semantics
(i.e. the metric is expected to increase monotonically)
which has been detected as having wrapped at some point in
the archive, pmlogcheck produces output describing the
metric name (with instance identifiers where appropri- ate),
the internal storage type for the metric, the value of the
metric before the counter wrap (with its associated
timestamp), and the value of the metric after the wrap (also
with a timestamp).</p>

<p>pmlogcheck produces two different timestamp formats,
depending on the interval over which it is run. For an
interval greater than 24 hours, the date is displayed in
addition to the time at which the counter wrap occurred. If
the extent of the data being checked is less than 24 hours,
a more precise format is used (time is displayed with
millisec- ond precision, but without the date).</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* default PMNS specification
files $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/hostname default directory for
PCP archives containing performance data collected from the
host hostname.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

intended to be self- explanatory.</p>
