OCF_HEARTBEAT_IPADDR(7)</p>

<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_IPaddr2 - Manages virtual IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses (Linux specific version)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS IPaddr2 [start | stop | status | monitor |
meta-data | validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This Linux-specific resource manages IP
alias IP addresses. It can add an IP alias, or remove one.
In addition, it can implement Cluster Alias IP functionality
if invoked as a clone resource.</p>

<p>If used as a clone, you should explicitly set
clone-node-max &gt;= 2, and/or clone-max &lt; number of
nodes. In case of node failure, clone instances need to be
re-allocated on surviving nodes. This would not be possible
if there is already an instance on those nodes, and
clone-node-max=1 (which is the default).</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS ip The IPv4 (dotted quad notation)
or IPv6 address (colon hexadecimal notation) example IPv4
&quot;192.168.1.1&quot;. example IPv6
&quot;2001:db8:DC28:0:0:FC57:D4C8:1FFF&quot;.</p>

<p>(unique, required, string, no default)</p>

<p>nic The base network interface on which the IP address
will be brought online. If left empty, the script will try
and determine this from the routing table.</p>

<p>Do NOT specify an alias interface in the form eth0:1 or
anything here; rather, specify the base interface only. If
you want a label, see the iflabel parameter.</p>

<p>Prerequisite:</p>

<p>There must be at least one static IP address, which is
not managed by the cluster, assigned to the network
interface. If you can not assign any static IP address on
the interface, modify this kernel parameter:</p>

<p>sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.promote_secondaries=1 # (or
per device)</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>cidr_netmask The netmask for the interface in CIDR
format (e.g., 24 and not 255.255.255.0)</p>

<p>If unspecified, the script will also try to determine
this from the routing table.</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>broadcast Broadcast address associated with the IP. If
left empty, the script will determine this from the
netmask.</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>iflabel You can specify an additional label for your IP
address here. This label is appended to your interface
name.</p>

<p>A label can be specified in nic parameter but it is
deprecated. If a label is specified in nic name, this
parameter has no effect.</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>lvs_support Enable support for LVS Direct Routing
configurations. In case a IP address is stopped, only move
it to the loopback device to allow the local node to
continue to service requests, but no longer advertise it on
the network.</p>

<p>Notes for IPv6: It is not necessary to enable this
option on IPv6. Instead, enable
&acute;lvs_ipv6_addrlabel&acute; option for LVS-DR usage on
IPv6.</p>

<p>(optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>lvs_ipv6_addrlabel Enable adding IPv6 address label so
IPv6 traffic originating from the address&acute;s interface
does not use this address as the source. This is necessary
for LVS-DR health checks to realservers to work. Without it,
the most recently added IPv6 address (probably the address
added by IPaddr2) will be used as the source address for
IPv6 traffic from that interface and since that address
exists on loopback on the realservers, the realserver
response to pings/connections will never leave its loopback.
See RFC3484 for the detail of the source address
selection.</p>

<p>See also &acute;lvs_ipv6_addrlabel_value&acute;
parameter.</p>

<p>(optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>lvs_ipv6_addrlabel_value Specify IPv6 address label
value used when &acute;lvs_ipv6_addrlabel&acute; is enabled.
The value should be an unused label in the policy table
which is shown by &acute;ip addrlabel list&acute; command.
You would rarely need to change this parameter.</p>

<p>(optional, integer, default 99)</p>

<p>mac Set the interface MAC address explicitly. Currently
only used in case of the Cluster IP Alias. Leave empty to
chose automatically.</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>clusterip_hash Specify the hashing algorithm used for
the Cluster IP functionality.</p>

<p>(optional, string, default
&quot;sourceip-sourceport&quot;)</p>

<p>unique_clone_address If true, add the clone ID to the
supplied value of IP to create a unique address to
manage</p>

<p>(optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>arp_interval Specify the interval between unsolicited
ARP packets in milliseconds.</p>

<p>(optional, integer, default 200)</p>

<p>arp_count Number of unsolicited ARP packets to send.</p>

<p>(optional, integer, default 5)</p>

<p>arp_bg Whether or not to send the ARP packets in the
background.</p>

<p>(optional, string, default &quot;true&quot;)</p>

<p>arp_mac MAC address to send the ARP packets to.</p>

<p>You really shouldn&acute;t be touching this.</p>

<p>(optional, string, default &quot;ffffffffffff&quot;)</p>

<p>arp_sender The program to send ARP packets with on
start. For infiniband interfaces, default is ipoibarping. If
ipoibarping is not available, set this to send_arp.</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>flush_routes Flush the routing table on stop. This is
for applications which use the cluster IP address and which
run on the same physical host that the IP address lives on.
The Linux kernel may force that application to take a
shortcut to the local loopback interface, instead of the
interface the address is really bound to. Under those
circumstances, an application may, somewhat unexpectedly,
continue to use connections for some time even after the IP
address is deconfigured. Set this parameter in order to
immediately disable said shortcut when the IP address goes
away.</p>

<p>(optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20s.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20s.</p>

<p>status Performs a status check. Suggested minimum
timeout: 20s. Suggested interval: 10s.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 20s. Suggested interval: 10s.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5s.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 20s.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
IPaddr2 resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive p_IPaddr2 ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 params
ip=string op monitor depth=&quot;0&quot;
timeout=&quot;20s&quot; interval=&quot;10s&quot;</p>
