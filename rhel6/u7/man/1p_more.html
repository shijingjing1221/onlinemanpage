<p>MORE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MORE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME more - display files on a page-by-page basis</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS more [-ceisu][-n number][-p command][-t
tagstring][file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The more utility shall read files and either
write them to the terminal on a page-by-page basis or filter
them to standard output. If standard output is not a
terminal device, all input files shall be copied to standard
output in their entirety, without modification, except as
specified for the -s option. If standard output is a
terminal device, the files shall be written a number of
lines (one screenful) at a time under the control of user
commands. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION sec- tion.</p>

<p>Certain block-mode terminals do not have all the
capabilities necessary to support the complete more
definition; they are incapable of accept- ing commands that
are not terminated with a &lt;newline&gt;. Implementations
that support such terminals shall provide an operating mode
to more in which all commands can be terminated with a
&lt;newline&gt; on those termi- nals. This mode:</p>

<p>* Shall be documented in the system documentation</p>

<p>* Shall, at invocation, inform the user of the terminal
deficiency that requires the &lt;newline&gt; usage and
provide instructions on how this warning can be suppressed
in future invocations</p>

<p>* Shall not be required for implementations supporting
only fully capable terminals</p>

<p>* Shall not affect commands already requiring
&lt;newline&gt;s</p>

<p>* Shall not affect users on the capable terminals from
using more as described in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001</p>

<p>OPTIONS The more utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c If a screen is to be written that has no lines in
common with the current screen, or more is writing its first
screen, more shall not scroll the screen, but instead shall
redraw each line of the screen in turn, from the top of the
screen to the bottom. In addition, if more is writing its
first screen, the screen shall be cleared. This option may
be silently ignored on devices with insufficient terminal
capabilities.</p>

<p>-e By default, more shall exit immediately after writing
the last line of the last file in the argument list. If the
-e option is specified:</p>

<p>1. If there is only a single file in the argument list
and that file was completely displayed on a single screen,
more shall exit immediately after writing the last line of
that file.</p>

<p>2. Otherwise, more shall exit only after reaching
end-of-file on the last file in the argument list twice
without an intervening operation. See the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>-i Perform pattern matching in searches without regard
to case; see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 9.2, Regular Expression General
Requirements.</p>

<p>-n number Specify the number of lines per screenful. The
number argument is a positive decimal integer. The -n option
shall override any values obtained from any other
source.</p>

<p>-p command Each time a screen from a new file is
displayed or redisplayed (including as a result of more
commands; for example, :p), exe- cute the more command(s) in
the command arguments in the order specified, as if entered
by the user after the first screen has been displayed. No
intermediate results shall be displayed (that is, if the
command is a movement to a screen different from the normal
first screen, only the screen resulting from the command
shall be displayed.) If any of the commands fail for any
reason, an informational message to this effect shall be
written, and no further commands specified using the -p
option shall be executed for this file.</p>

<p>-s Behave as if consecutive empty lines were a single
empty line.</p>

<p>-t tagstring Write the screenful of the file containing
the tag named by the tagstring argument. See the ctags
utility. The tags feature rep- resented by -t tagstring and
the :t command is optional. It shall be provided on any
system that also provides a conforming implementation of
ctags; otherwise, the use of -t produces unde- fined
results.</p>

<p>The filename resulting from the -t option shall be
logically added as a prefix to the list of command line
files, as if specified by the user. If the tag named by the
tagstring argument is not found, it shall be an error, and
more shall take no further action.</p>

<p>If the tag specifies a line number, the first line of
the display shall contain the beginning of that line. If the
tag specifies a pattern, the first line of the display shall
contain the beginning of the matching text from the first
line of the file that contains that pattern. If the line
does not exist in the file or matching text is not found, an
informational message to this effect shall be displayed, and
more shall display the default screen as if -t had not been
specified.</p>

<p>If both the -t tagstring and -p command options are
given, the -t tagstring shall be processed first; that is,
the file and starting line for the display shall be as
specified by -t, and then the -p more com- mand shall be
executed. If the line (matching text) specified by the -t
command does not exist (is not found), no -p more command
shall be exe- cuted for this file at any time.</p>

<p>-u Treat a &lt;backspace&gt; as a printable control
character, displayed as an implementation-defined character
sequence (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section), suppressing
backspacing and the special handling that produces
underlined or standout mode text on some terminal types.
Also, do not ignore a &lt;carriage-return&gt; at the end of
a line.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If no file operands
are specified, the standard input shall be used. If a file
is, the standard input shall be read at that point in the
sequence.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is-.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files being examined shall be text
files. If standard output is a terminal, standard error
shall be used to read commands from the user. If standard
output is a terminal, standard error is not readable, and
command input is needed, more may attempt to obtain user
commands from the controlling terminal (for example,
/dev/tty); otherwise, more shall terminate with an error
indicating that it was unable to read user commands. If
standard output is not a terminal, no error shall result if
standard error cannot be opened for reading.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of more:</p>

<p>COLUMNS Override the system-selected horizontal display
line size. See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables for valid
values and results when it is unset or null.</p>

<p>EDITOR Used by the v command to select an editor. See
the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and the behavior of character classes
within regular expres- sions.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>LINES Override the system-selected vertical screen size,
used as the number of lines in a screenful. See the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8,
Environment Variables for valid values and results when it
is unset or null. The -n option shall take precedence over
the LINES variable for determining the number of lines in a
screenful.</p>

<p>MORE Determine a string containing options described in
the OPTIONS section preceded with hyphens and
&lt;blank&gt;-separated as on the command line. Any command
line options shall be processed after those in the MORE
variable, as if the command line were:</p>

<p>more $MORE options operands</p>

<p>The MORE variable shall take precedence over the TERM
and LINES vari- ables for determining the number of lines in
a screenful.</p>

<p>TERM Determine the name of the terminal type. If this
variable is unset or null, an unspecified default terminal
type is used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall be used to write the
contents of the input files.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used for diagnostic
messages and user com- mands (see the INPUT FILES section),
and, if standard output is a ter- minal device, to write a
prompting string. The prompting string shall appear on the
screen line below the last line of the file displayed in the
current screenful. The prompt shall contain the name of the
file currently being examined and shall contain an
end-of-file indication and the name of the next file, if
any, when prompting at the end-of- file. If an error or
informational message is displayed, it is unspeci- fied
whether it is contained in the prompt. If it is not
contained in the prompt, it shall be displayed and then the
user shall be prompted for a continuation character, at
which point another message or the user prompt may be
displayed. The prompt is otherwise unspecified. It is
unspecified whether informational messages are written for
other user commands.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION The following section describes the
behavior of more when the standard output is a terminal
device. If the standard output is not a terminal device, no
options other than -s shall have any effect, and all input
files shall be copied to standard output otherwise
unmodified, at which time more shall exit without further
action.</p>

<p>The number of lines available per screen shall be
determined by the -n option, if present, or by examining
values in the environment (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
section). If neither method yields a number, an unspecified
number of lines shall be used.</p>

<p>The maximum number of lines written shall be one less
than this number, because the screen line after the last
line written shall be used to write a user prompt and user
input. If the number of lines in the screen is less than
two, the results are undefined. It is unspecified whether
user input is permitted to be longer than the remainder of
the single line where the prompt has been written.</p>

<p>The number of columns available per line shall be
determined by examin- ing values in the environment (see the
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section), with a default value as
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p>Lines that are longer than the display shall be folded;
the length at which folding occurs is unspecified, but
should be appropriate for the output device. Folding may
occur between glyphs of single characters that take up
multiple display columns.</p>

<p>When standard output is a terminal and -u is not
specified, more shall treat &lt;backspace&gt;s and
&lt;carriage-return&gt;s specially:</p>

<p>* A character, followed first by a sequence of n
&lt;backspace&gt;s (where n is the same as the number of
column positions that the character occupies), then by n
underscore characters (_), shall cause that character to be
written as underlined text, if the terminal type supports
that. The n underscore characters, followed first by n
&lt;backspace&gt;s, then any character with n column
positions, shall also cause that character to be written as
underlined text, if the termi- nal type supports that.</p>

<p>* A sequence of n &lt;backspace&gt;s (where n is the
same as the number of column positions that the previous
character occupies) that appears between two identical
printable characters shall cause the first of those two
characters to be written as emboldened text (that is,
visually brighter, standout mode, or inverse-video mode), if
the terminal type supports that, and the second to be
discarded. Immedi- ately subsequent occurrences of
&lt;backspace&gt;/ character pairs for that same character
shall also be discarded. (For example, the bbb sequence
&quot;aaaa&quot; is interpreted as a single emboldened a
.)</p>

<p>* The more utility shall logically discard all other
&lt;backspace&gt;s from the line as well as the character
which precedes them, if any.</p>

<p>* A &lt;carriage-return&gt; at the end of a line shall
be ignored, rather than being written as a non-printable
character, as described in the next paragraph.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined how other non-printable
characters are written. Implementations should use the same
format that they use for the ex print command; see the
OPTIONS section within the ed utility. It is unspecified
whether a multi-column character shall be separated if it
crosses a display line boundary; it shall not be discarded.
The behavior is unspecified if the number of columns on the
display is less than the number of columns any single
character in the line being dis- played would occupy.</p>

<p>When each new file is displayed (or redisplayed), more
shall write the first screen of the file. Once the initial
screen has been written, more shall prompt for a user
command. If the execution of the user com- mand results in a
screen that has lines in common with the current screen, and
the device has sufficient terminal capabilities, more shall
scroll the screen; otherwise, it is unspecified whether the
screen is scrolled or redrawn.</p>

<p>For all files but the last (including standard input if
no file was specified, and for the last file as well, if the
-e option was not specified), when more has written the last
line in the file, more shall prompt for a user command. This
prompt shall contain the name of the next file as well as an
indication that more has reached end-of-file. If the user
command is f, &lt;control&gt;-F, &lt;space&gt;, j,
&lt;newline&gt;, d, &lt;con- trol&gt;-D, or s, more shall
display the next file. Otherwise, if display- ing the last
file, more shall exit. Otherwise, more shall execute the
user command specified.</p>

<p>Several of the commands described in this section
display a previous screen from the input stream. In the case
that text is being taken from a non-rewindable stream, such
as a pipe, it is implementation-defined how much backwards
motion is supported. If a command cannot be executed because
of a limitation on backwards motion, an error message to
this effect shall be displayed, the current screen shall not
change, and the user shall be prompted for another
command.</p>

<p>If a command cannot be performed because there are
insufficient lines to display, more shall alert the
terminal. If a command cannot be per- formed because there
are insufficient lines to display or a / command fails: if
the input is the standard input, the last screen in the file
may be displayed; otherwise, the current file and screen
shall not change, and the user shall be prompted for another
command.</p>

<p>The interactive commands in the following sections shall
be supported. Some commands can be preceded by a decimal
integer, called count in the following descriptions. If not
specified with the command, count shall default to 1. In the
following descriptions, pattern is a basic regular
expression, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Regular
Expressions. The term &quot;examine&quot; is historical
usage meaning &quot;open the file for viewing; for example,
more foo would be expressed as examining file foo.</p>

<p>In the following descriptions, unless otherwise
specified, line is a line in the more display, not a line
from the file being examined.</p>

<p>In the following descriptions, the current position
refers to two things:</p>

<p>1. The position of the current line on the screen</p>

<p>2. The line number (in the file) of the current line on
the screen</p>

<p>Usually, the line on the screen corresponding to the
current position is the third line on the screen. If this is
not possible (there are fewer than three lines to display or
this is the first page of the file, or it is the last page
of the file), then the current position is either the first
or last line on the screen as described later.</p>

<p>Help Synopsis:</p>

<p>h</p>

<p>Write a summary of these commands and other
implementation-defined com- mands. The behavior shall be as
if the more utility were executed with the -e option on a
file that contained the summary information. The user shall
be prompted as described earlier in this section when end-
of-file is reached. If the user command is one of those
specified to continue to the next file, more shall return to
the file and screen state from which the h command was
executed.</p>

<p>Scroll Forward One Screenful Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]f [count]&lt;control&gt;-F</p>

<p>Scroll forward count lines, with a default of one
screenful. If count is more than the screen size, only the
final screenful shall be writ- ten.</p>

<p>Scroll Backward One Screenful Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]b [count]&lt;control&gt;-B</p>

<p>Scroll backward count lines, with a default of one
screenful (see the -n option). If count is more than the
screen size, only the final screenful shall be written.</p>

<p>Scroll Forward One Line Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]&lt;space&gt; [count]j [count]&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>Scroll forward count lines. The default count for the
&lt;space&gt; shall be one screenful; for j and
&lt;newline&gt;, one line. The entire count lines shall be
written, even if count is more than the screen size.</p>

<p>Scroll Backward One Line Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]k</p>

<p>Scroll backward count lines. The entire count lines
shall be written, even if count is more than the screen
size.</p>

<p>Scroll Forward One Half Screenful Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]d [count]&lt;control&gt;-D</p>

<p>Scroll forward count lines, with a default of one half
of the screen size. If count is specified, it shall become
the new default for subse- quent d, &lt;control&gt;-D, and u
commands.</p>

<p>Skip Forward One Line Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]s</p>

<p>Display the screenful beginning with the line count
lines after the last line on the current screen. If count
would cause the current posi- tion to be such that less than
one screenful would be written, the last screenful in the
file shall be written.</p>

<p>Scroll Backward One Half Screenful Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]u [count]&lt;control&gt;-U</p>

<p>Scroll backward count lines, with a default of one half
of the screen size. If count is specified, it shall become
the new default for subse- quent d, &lt;control&gt;-D, u,
and &lt;control&gt;-U commands. The entire count lines shall
be written, even if count is more than the screen size.</p>

<p>Go to Beginning of File Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]g</p>

<p>Display the screenful beginning with line count.</p>

<p>Go to End-of-File Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]G</p>

<p>If count is specified, display the screenful beginning
with the line count. Otherwise, display the last screenful
of the file.</p>

<p>Refresh the Screen Synopsis:</p>

<p>r &lt;control&gt;-L</p>

<p>Refresh the screen.</p>

<p>Discard and Refresh Synopsis:</p>

<p>R</p>

<p>Refresh the screen, discarding any buffered input. If
the current file is non-seekable, buffered input shall not
be discarded and the R com- mand shall be equivalent to the
r command.</p>

<p>Mark Position Synopsis:</p>

<p>mletter</p>

<p>Mark the current position with the letter named by
letter, where letter represents the name of one of the
lowercase letters of the portable character set. When a new
file is examined, all marks may be lost.</p>

<p>Return to Mark Synopsis:</p>

<p>letter</p>

<p>Return to the position that was previously marked with
the letter named by letter, making that line the current
position.</p>

<p>Return to Previous Position Synopsis:</p>

<p>Return to the position from which the last large
movement command was executed (where a &quot;large
movement&quot; is defined as any movement of more than a
screenful of lines). If no such movements have been made,
return to the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>Search Forward for Pattern Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]/[!]pattern&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>Display the screenful beginning with the countth line
containing the pattern. The search shall start after the
first line currently dis- played. The null regular
expression (/followed by a &lt;newline&gt;) shall repeat the
search using the previous regular expression, with a default
count. If the character !is included, the matching lines
shall be those that do not contain the pattern. If no match
is found for the pattern, a message to that effect shall be
displayed.</p>

<p>Search Backward for Pattern Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]?[!]pattern&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>Display the screenful beginning with the countth
previous line contain- ing the pattern. The search shall
start on the last line before the first line currently
displayed. The null regular expression (?fol- lowed by a
&lt;newline&gt;) shall repeat the search using the previous
regu- lar expression, with a default count. If the
character! is included, matching lines shall be those that
do not contain the pattern. If no match is found for the
pattern, a message to that effect shall be dis- played.</p>

<p>Repeat Search Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]n</p>

<p>Repeat the previous search for countth line containing
the last pattern (or not containing the last pattern, if the
previous search was &quot;/!&quot; or &quot;?!&quot; ).</p>

<p>Repeat Search in Reverse Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]N</p>

<p>Repeat the search in the opposite direction of the
previous search for the countth line containing the last
pattern (or not containing the last pattern, if the previous
search was &quot;/!&quot; or &quot;?!&quot; ).</p>

<p>Examine New File Synopsis:</p>

<p>:e [filename]&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>Examine a new file. If the filename argument is not
specified, the cur- rent file (see the :n and :p commands
below) shall be re-examined. The filename shall be subjected
to the process of shell word expansions (see Word Expansions
); if more than a single pathname results, the effects are
unspecified. If filename is a number sign ( # ), the
previously examined file shall be re-examined. If filename
is not accessible for any reason (including that it is a
non-seekable file), an error message to this effect shall be
displayed and the current file and screen shall not
change.</p>

<p>Examine Next File Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]:n</p>

<p>Examine the next file. If a number count is specified,
the countth next file shall be examined. If filename refers
to a non-seekable file, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>Examine Previous File Synopsis:</p>

<p>[count]:p</p>

<p>Examine the previous file. If a number count is
specified, the countth previous file shall be examined. If
filename refers to a non-seekable file, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p>Go to Tag Synopsis:</p>

<p>:t tagstring&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p>If the file containing the tag named by the tagstring
argument is not the current file, examine the file, as if
the :e command was executed with that file as the argument.
Otherwise, or in addition, display the screenful beginning
with the tag, as described for the -t option (see the
OPTIONS section). If the ctags utility is not supported by
the system, the use of :t produces undefined results.</p>

<p>Invoke Editor Synopsis:</p>

<p>v</p>

<p>Invoke an editor to edit the current file being
examined. If standard input is being examined, the results
are unspecified. The name of the editor shall be taken from
the environment variable EDITOR , or shall default to vi. If
the last pathname component in EDITOR is either vi or ex,
the editor shall be invoked with a -c linenumber command
line argu- ment, where linenumber is the line number of the
file line containing the display line currently displayed as
the first line of the screen. It is implementation-defined
whether line-setting options are passed to editors other
than vi and ex.</p>

<p>When the editor exits, more shall resume with the same
file and screen as when the editor was invoked.</p>

<p>Display Position Synopsis:</p>

<p>= &lt;control&gt;-G</p>

<p>Write a message for which the information references the
first byte of the line after the last line of the file on
the screen. This message shall include the name of the file
currently being examined, its number relative to the total
number of files there are to examine, the line number in the
file, the byte number and the total bytes in the file, and
what percentage of the file precedes the current position.
If more is reading from standard input, or the file is
shorter than a single screen, the line number, the byte
number, the total bytes, and the per- centage need not be
written.</p>

<p>Quit Synopsis:</p>

<p>q :q ZZ</p>

<p>Exit more.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If an error is encountered
accessing a file when using the :n command, more shall
attempt to examine the next file in the argument list, but
the final exit status shall be affected. If an error is
encountered accessing a file via the :p command, more shall
attempt to examine the previous file in the argument list,
but the final exit status shall be affected. If an error is
encountered accessing a file via the :e com- mand, more
shall remain in the current file and the final exit status
shall not be affected.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE When the standard output is not a
terminal, only the -s filter-modifi- cation option is
effective. This is based on historical practice. For
example, a typical implementation of man pipes its output
through more -s to squeeze excess white space for terminal
users. When man is piped to lp, however, it is undesirable
for this squeezing to happen.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The -p allows arbitrary commands to be executed
at the start of each file. Examples are:</p>

<p>more -p G file1 file2</p>

<p>Examine each file starting with its last screenful.</p>

<p>more -p 100 file1 file2</p>

<p>Examine each file starting with line 100 in the current
position (usually the third line, so line 98 would be the
first line written).</p>

<p>more -p /100 file1 file2</p>

<p>Examine each file starting with the first line
containing the string &quot;100&quot; in the current
position</p>

<p>RATIONALE The more utility, available in BSD and
BSD-derived systems, was chosen as the prototype for the
POSIX file display program since it is more widely available
than either the public-domain program less or than pg, a
pager provided in System V. The 4.4 BSD more is the model
for the features selected; it is almost fully
upwards-compatible from the 4.3 BSD version in wide use and
has become more amenable for vi users. Several features
originally derived from various file editors, found in both
less and pg, have been added to this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 as they have proved extremely popular with
users.</p>

<p>There are inconsistencies between more and vi that
result from historical practice. For example, the
single-character commands h, f, b, and &lt;space&gt; are
screen movers in more, but cursor movers in vi. These
inconsistencies were maintained because the cursor movements
are not applicable to more and the powerful functionality
achieved without the use of the control key justifies the
differences.</p>

<p>The tags interface has been included in a program that
is not a text editor because it promotes another degree of
consistent operation with vi. It is conceivable that the
paging environment of more would be superior for browsing
source code files in some circumstances.</p>

<p>The operating mode referred to for block-mode terminals
effectively adds a &lt;newline&gt; to each Synopsis line
that currently has none. So, for example, d &lt;newline&gt;
would page one screenful. The mode could be trig- gered by a
command line option, environment variable, or some other
method. The details are not imposed by this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 because there are so few systems known to
support such terminals. Nevertheless, it was considered that
all systems should be able to support more given the
exception cited for this small commu- nity of terminals
because, in comparison to vi, the cursor movements are few
and the command set relatively amenable to the optional
&lt;new- line&gt;s.</p>

<p>Some versions of more provide a shell escaping mechanism
similar to the ex ! command. The standard developers did not
consider that this was necessary in a paginator,
particularly given the wide acceptance of multiple window
terminals and job control features. (They chose to retain
such features in the editors and mailx because the shell
inter- action also gives an opportunity to modify the
editing buffer, which is not applicable to more.)</p>

<p>The -p (position) option replaces the + command because
of the Utility Syntax Guidelines. In early proposals, it
took a pattern argument, but historical less provided the
more general facility of a command. It would have been
desirable to use the same -c as ex and vi, but the let- ter
was already in use.</p>

<p>The text stating &quot;from a non-rewindable stream ...
implementations may limit the amount of backwards motion
supported&quot; would allow an imple- mentation that
permitted no backwards motion beyond text already on the
screen. It was not possible to require a minimum amount of
backwards motion that would be effective for all conceivable
device types. The implementation should allow the user to
back up as far as possible, within device and reasonable
memory allocation constraints.</p>

<p>Historically, non-printable characters were displayed
using the ARPA standard mappings, which are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Printable characters are left alone.</p>

<p>2. Control characters less than 177 are represented as
followed by the character offset from the@character in the
ASCII map; for example, 07 is represented asG.</p>

<p>3. 177 is represented as followed by?.</p>

<p>The display of characters having their eighth bit set
was less stan- dard. Existing implementations use hex
(0x00), octal ( 00), and a meta-bit display. (The latter
displayed characters with their eighth bit set as the two
characters &quot;M-&quot;, followed by the seven-bit display
as described previously.) The latter probably has the best
claim to historical practice because it was used with the -v
option of 4 BSD and 4 BSD-derived versions of the cat
utility since 1980.</p>

<p>No specific display format is required by IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Imple- mentations are encouraged to conform to
historic practice in the absence of any strong reason to
diverge.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
