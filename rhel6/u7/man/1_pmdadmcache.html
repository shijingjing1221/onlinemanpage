<p>NAME pmdadmcache - Device Mapper Cache PMDA</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdadmcache is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values about device mapper
cache target devices, made available by the dm-cache Linux
kernel module.</p>

<p>The device mapper cache target aims to improve the
performance of a block device (such as a spindle) by
dynamically migrating some of its data to a faster, smaller
device (such as a Solid State Drive).</p>

<p>This PMDA exports metrics for each configured cache,
including sizes, cache read and write hits and misses, rates
of cached block demotion and promotion, and the mode each
cache is operating in.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Install the dmcache PMDA by using the
Install script as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dmcache # ./Install</p>

<p>To uninstall, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dmcache # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdadmcache is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dmcache/Install installation script
for the pmdadmcache agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dmcache/Remove undo installation script
for the pmdadmcache agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/dmcache.log default log file for error
messages from pmdadmcache</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
