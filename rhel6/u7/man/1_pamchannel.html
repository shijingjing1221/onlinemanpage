<p>NAME pamchannel - extract channels from a PAM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamchannel [-infile infile] [-tupletype
tupletype] [channum ...]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamchannel reads a PAM or PNM image as input and
produces a PAM image as output, consisting of the indicated
channels (planes) of the input.</p>

<p>The output is the same dimensions as the input, except
that the depth is the number of channum arguments you
supply. The tuple type is a null string unless you specify
the -tupletype option.</p>

<p>This program works on multi-image streams, producing a
corresponding output stream. But before Netpbm 10.32
(February 2006), it ignored every image after the first.</p>

<p>pamstack does the opposite of pamchannel: It takes
multiple PAM or PNM images as input and stacks their planes
(channels) on top of one another to yield a single PAM.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -infile infile This specifies the input file,
which defaults to Standard Input. You may specify - to
select Standard Input explicitly.</p>

<p>This is a little unconventional for Netpbm programs,
which usu- ally have the input file specification as an
argument. For pam- channel, the arguments are channel
numbers.</p>

<p>-tupletype tupletype This specified the tuple type name
to be recorded in the output. You may use any string up to
255 characters. Some programs rec- ognize some names. If you
omit this option, the default tuple type name is null.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamchannel was new, along with the PAM format,
in Netpbm 9.7 (August 2000).</p>
