<p>PERLGLOSSARY(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLGLOSSARY(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlglossary - Perl Glossary</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A glossary of terms (technical and
otherwise) used in the Perl documentation. Other useful
sources include the Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing
&lt;http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/index.html&gt;, the
Jargon File &lt;http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/&gt;, and
Wikipedia &lt;http://www.wikipedia.org/&gt;.</p>

<p>A accessor methods A &quot;method&quot; used to
indirectly inspect or update an &quot;object&quot;s state
(its instance variables).</p>

<p>actual arguments The scalar values that you supply to a
&quot;function&quot; or &quot;subroutine&quot; when you call
it. For instance, when you call
&quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;, the string
&quot;puff&quot; is the actual argument. See also
&quot;argument&quot; and &quot;formal arguments&quot;.</p>

<p>address operator Some languages work directly with the
memory addresses of values, but this can be like playing
with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves for
handling all memory management. The closest to an address
operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you
a &quot;hard reference&quot;, which is much safer than a
memory address.</p>

<p>algorithm A well-defined sequence of steps, clearly
enough explained that even a computer could do them.</p>

<p>alias A nickname for something, which behaves in all
ways as though youd used the original name instead of the
nickname. Temporary aliases are implicitly created in the
loop variable for &quot;foreach&quot; loops, in the $_
variable for map or grep operators, in $a and $b during
sorts comparison function, and in each element of @_ for the
&quot;actual arguments&quot; of a subroutine call. Permanent
aliases are explicitly created in packages by importing
symbols or by assignment to typeglobs. Lexically scoped
aliases for package variables are explicitly created by the
our declaration.</p>

<p>alternatives A list of possible choices from which you
may select only one, as in &quot;Would you like door A, B,
or C?&quot; Alternatives in regular expressions are
separated with a single vertical bar: &quot;|&quot;.
Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with a
double vertical bar: &quot;||&quot;. Logical alternatives in
&quot;Boolean&quot; expressions are separated with either
&quot;||&quot; or &quot;or&quot;.</p>

<p>anonymous Used to describe a &quot;referent&quot; that
is not directly accessible through a named
&quot;variable&quot;. Such a referent must be indirectly
accessible through at least one &quot;hard reference&quot;.
When the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous
referent is destroyed without pity.</p>

<p>architecture The kind of computer you re working on,
where one &quot;kind&quot; of computer means all those
computers sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl
programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable
images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the
architecture its running on than programs in other
languages, such as C, that are compiled into machine code.
See also &quot;platform&quot; and &quot;operating
system&quot;.</p>

<p>argument A piece of data supplied to a program,
&quot;subroutine&quot;, &quot;function&quot;, or
&quot;method&quot; to tell it what its supposed to do. Also
called a &quot;parameter&quot;.</p>

<p>ARGV The name of the array containing the
&quot;argument&quot; &quot;vector&quot; from the command
line. If you use the empty
&quot;E&lt;lt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;&quot; operator,
&quot;ARGV&quot; is the name of both the
&quot;filehandle&quot; used to traverse the arguments and
the &quot;scalar&quot; containing the name of the current
input file.</p>

<p>arithmetical operator A &quot;symbol&quot; such as
&quot;+&quot; or &quot;/&quot; that tells Perl to do the
arithmetic you were supposed to learn in grade school.</p>

<p>array An ordered sequence of values, stored such that
you can easily access any of the values using an integer
&quot;subscript&quot; that specifies the values
&quot;offset&quot; in the sequence.</p>

<p>array context An archaic expression for what is more
correctly referred to as &quot;list context&quot;.</p>

<p>ASCII The American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (a 7-bit character set adequate only for poorly
representing English text). Often used loosely to describe
the lowest 128 values of the various ISO-8859-X character
sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes best
described as half ASCII. See also &quot;Unicode&quot;.</p>

<p>assertion A component of a &quot;regular
expression&quot; that must be true for the pattern to match
but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often
used specifically to mean a &quot;zero width&quot;
assertion.</p>

<p>assignment An &quot;operator&quot; whose assigned
mission in life is to change the value of a
&quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p>assignment operator Either a regular
&quot;assignment&quot;, or a compound &quot;operator&quot;
composed of an ordinary assignment and some other operator,
that changes the value of a variable in place, that is,
relative to its old value. For example, &quot;$a += 2&quot;
adds 2 to $a.</p>

<p>associative array See &quot;hash&quot;. Please.</p>

<p>associativity Determines whether you do the left
&quot;operator&quot; first or the right &quot;operator&quot;
first when you have &quot;A &quot;operator&quot; B
&quot;operator&quot; C&quot; and the two operators are of
the same precedence. Operators like &quot;+&quot; are left
associative, while operators like &quot;**&quot; are right
associative. See perlop for a list of operators and their
associativity.</p>

<p>asynchronous Said of events or activities whose relative
temporal ordering is indeterminate because too many things
are going on at once. Hence, an asynchronous event is one
you didnt know when to expect.</p>

<p>atom A &quot;regular expression&quot; component
potentially matching a &quot;substring&quot; containing one
or more characters and treated as an indivisible syntactic
unit by any following &quot;quantifier&quot;. (Contrast with
an &quot;assertion&quot; that matches something of
&quot;zero width&quot; and may not be quantified.)</p>

<p>atomic operation When Democritus gave the word
&quot;atom&quot; to the indivisible bits of matter, he meant
literally something that could not be cut: a- (not) + tomos
(cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that can t be
interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.</p>

<p>attribute A new feature that allows the declaration of
variables and subroutines with modifiers as in &quot;sub foo
: locked method&quot;. Also, another name for an
&quot;instance variable&quot; of an &quot;object&quot;.</p>

<p>autogeneration A feature of &quot;operator
overloading&quot; of objects, whereby the behavior of
certain operators can be reasonably deduced using more
fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded
operators will often have the same relationships as the
regular operators. See perlop.</p>

<p>autoincrement To add one to something automatically,
hence the name of the &quot;++&quot; operator. To instead
subtract one from something automatically is known as an
&quot;autodecrement&quot;.</p>

<p>autoload To load on demand. (Also called
&quot;lazy&quot; loading.) Specifically, to call an AUTOLOAD
subroutine on behalf of an undefined subroutine.</p>

<p>autosplit To split a string automatically, as the -a
&quot;switch&quot; does when running under -p or -n in order
to emulate &quot;awk&quot;. (See also the AutoSplit module,
which has nothing to do with the -a switch, but a lot to do
with autoloading.)</p>

<p>autovivification A Greco-Roman word meaning &quot;to
bring oneself to life&quot;. In Perl, storage locations
(lvalues) spontaneously generate themselves as needed,
including the creation of any &quot;hard reference&quot;
values to point to the next level of storage. The assignment
&quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] = &quot;quintet&quot;&quot;
potentially creates five scalar storage locations, plus four
references (in the first four scalar locations) pointing to
four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar
locations). But the point of autovivification is that you
dont have to worry about it.</p>

<p>AV Short for &quot;array value&quot;, which refers to
one of Perls internal data types that holds an
&quot;array&quot;. The &quot;AV&quot; type is a subclass of
&quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p>awk Descriptive editing term--short for
&quot;awkward&quot;. Also coincidentally refers to a
venerable text-processing language from which Perl derived
some of its high-level ideas.</p>

<p>B backreference A substring captured by a subpattern
within unadorned parentheses in a &quot;regex&quot;.
Backslashed decimal numbers (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;,
etc.) later in the same pattern refer back to the
corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside the
pattern, the numbered variables ($1, $2, etc.) continue to
refer to these same values, as long as the pattern was the
last successful match of the current dynamic scope.</p>

<p>backtracking The practice of saying, &quot;If I had to
do it all over, I d do it differently,&quot; and then
actually going back and doing it all over differently.
Mathematically speaking, its returning from an unsuccessful
recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when
it attempts to match patterns with a &quot;regular
expression&quot;, and its earlier attempts dont pan out. See
&quot;Backtracking&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p>backward compatibility Means you can still run your old
program because we didnt break any of the features or bugs
it was relying on.</p>

<p>bareword A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed
illegal under use strict subs. In the absence of that
stricture, a bareword is treated as if quotes were around
it.</p>

<p>base class A generic &quot;object&quot; type; that is, a
&quot;class&quot; from which other, more specific classes
are derived genetically by &quot;inheritance&quot;. Also
called a &quot;superclass&quot; by people who respect their
ancestors.</p>

<p>big-endian From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end
first. Also used of computers that store the most
significant &quot;byte&quot; of a word at a lower byte
address than the least significant byte. Often considered
superior to little-endian machines. See also &quot;little-
endian&quot;.</p>

<p>binary Having to do with numbers represented in base 2.
That means theres basically two numbers, 0 and 1. Also used
to describe a &quot;non-text file&quot;, presumably because
such a file makes full use of all the binary bits in its
bytes. With the advent of &quot;Unicode&quot;, this
distinction, already suspect, loses even more of its
meaning.</p>

<p>binary operator An &quot;operator&quot; that takes two
operands.</p>

<p>bind To assign a specific &quot;network address&quot; to
a &quot;socket&quot;.</p>

<p>bit An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The
smallest possible unit of information storage. An eighth of
a &quot;byte&quot; or of a dollar. (The term &quot;Pieces of
Eight&quot; comes from being able to split the old Spanish
dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money.
Thats why a 25-cent piece today is still &quot;two
bits&quot;.)</p>

<p>bit shift The movement of bits left or right in a
computer word, which has the effect of multiplying or
dividing by a power of 2.</p>

<p>bit string A sequence of bits that is actually being
thought of as a sequence of bits, for once.</p>

<p>bless In corporate life, to grant official approval to a
thing, as in, &quot;The VP of Engineering has blessed our
WebCruncher project.&quot; Similarly in Perl, to grant
official approval to a &quot;referent&quot; so that it can
function as an &quot;object&quot;, such as a WebCruncher
object. See &quot;bless&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>block What a &quot;process&quot; does when it has to
wait for something: &quot;My process blocked waiting for the
disk.&quot; As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large chunk
of data, of a size that the &quot;operating system&quot;
likes to deal with (normally a power of two such as 512 or
8192). Typically refers to a chunk of data thats coming from
or going to a disk file.</p>

<p>BLOCK A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of
Perl statements that is delimited by braces. The
&quot;if&quot; and &quot;while&quot; statements are defined
in terms of BLOCKs, for instance. Sometimes we also say
&quot;block&quot; to mean a lexical scope; that is, a
sequence of statements that act like a &quot;BLOCK&quot;,
such as within an eval or a file, even though the statements
arent delimited by braces.</p>

<p>block buffering A method of making input and output
efficient by passing one &quot;block&quot; at a time. By
default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See
&quot;buffer&quot; and &quot;command buffering&quot;.</p>

<p>Boolean A value that is either &quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>Boolean context A special kind of &quot;scalar
context&quot; used in conditionals to decide whether the
&quot;scalar value&quot; returned by an expression is
&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Does not evaluate as
either a string or a number. See &quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p>breakpoint A spot in your program where youve told the
debugger to stop execution so you can poke around and see
whether anything is wrong yet.</p>

<p>broadcast To send a &quot;datagram&quot; to multiple
destinations simultaneously.</p>

<p>BSD A psychoactive drug, popular in the 80s, probably
developed at U. C. Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many
ways to the prescription-only medication called &quot;System
V&quot;, but infinitely more useful. (Or, at least, more
fun.) The full chemical name is &quot;Berkeley Standard
Distribution&quot;.</p>

<p>bucket A location in a &quot;hash table&quot; containing
(potentially) multiple entries whose keys &quot;hash&quot;
to the same hash value according to its hash function. (As
internal policy, you dont have to worry about it, unless
youre into internals, or policy.)</p>

<p>buffer A temporary holding location for data. Block
buffering means that the data is passed on to its
destination whenever the buffer is full. Line buffering
means that it s passed on whenever a complete line is
received. Command buffering means that its passed every time
you do a print command (or equivalent). If your output is
unbuffered, the system processes it one byte at a time
without the use of a holding area. This can be rather
inefficient.</p>

<p>built-in A &quot;function&quot; that is predefined in
the language. Even when hidden by &quot;overriding&quot;,
you can always get at a built-in function by qualifying its
name with the &quot;CORE::&quot; pseudo-package.</p>

<p>bundle A group of related modules on &quot;CPAN&quot;.
(Also, sometimes refers to a group of command-line switches
grouped into one &quot;switch cluster&quot;.)</p>

<p>byte A piece of data worth eight bits in most
places.</p>

<p>bytecode A pidgin-like language spoken among droids when
they dont wish to reveal their orientation (see
&quot;endian&quot;). Named after some similar languages
spoken (for similar reasons) between compilers and
interpreters in the late 20th century. These languages are
characterized by representing everything as a
non-architecture- dependent sequence of bytes.</p>

<p>C C A language beloved by many for its inside-out
&quot;type&quot; definitions, inscrutable
&quot;precedence&quot; rules, and heavy
&quot;overloading&quot; of the function-call mechanism.
(Well, actually, people first switched to C because they
found lowercase identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl
is written in C, so its not surprising that Perl borrowed a
few ideas from it.</p>

<p>C preprocessor The typical C compilers first pass, which
processes lines beginning with &quot;#&quot; for conditional
compilation and macro definition and does various
manipulations of the program text based on the current
definitions. Also known as cpp(1).</p>

<p>call by reference An &quot;argument&quot;-passing
mechanism in which the &quot;formal arguments&quot; refer
directly to the &quot;actual arguments&quot;, and the
&quot;subroutine&quot; can change the actual arguments by
changing the formal arguments. That is, the formal argument
is an &quot;alias&quot; for the actual argument. See also
&quot;call by value&quot;.</p>

<p>call by value An &quot;argument&quot;-passing mechanism
in which the &quot;formal arguments&quot; refer to a copy of
the &quot;actual arguments&quot;, and the
&quot;subroutine&quot; cannot change the actual arguments by
changing the formal arguments. See also &quot;call by
reference&quot;.</p>

<p>callback A &quot;handler&quot; that you register with
some other part of your program in the hope that the other
part of your program will &quot;trigger&quot; your handler
when some event of interest transpires.</p>

<p>canonical Reduced to a standard form to facilitate
comparison.</p>

<p>capturing The use of parentheses around a
&quot;subpattern&quot; in a &quot;regular expression&quot;
to store the matched &quot;substring&quot; as a
&quot;backreference&quot;. (Captured strings are also
returned as a list in &quot;list context&quot;.)</p>

<p>character A small integer representative of a unit of
orthography. Historically, characters were usually stored as
fixed-width integers (typically in a byte, or maybe two,
depending on the character set), but with the advent of
UTF-8, characters are often stored in a variable number of
bytes depending on the size of the integer that represents
the character. Perl manages this transparently for you, for
the most part.</p>

<p>character class A square-bracketed list of characters
used in a &quot;regular expression&quot; to indicate that
any character of the set may occur at a given point.
Loosely, any predefined set of characters so used.</p>

<p>character property A predefined &quot;character
class&quot; matchable by the &quot;&quot;
&quot;metasymbol&quot;. Many standard properties are defined
for &quot;Unicode&quot;.</p>

<p>circumfix operator An &quot;operator&quot; that
surrounds its &quot;operand&quot;, like the angle operator,
or parentheses, or a hug.</p>

<p>class A user-defined &quot;type&quot;, implemented in
Perl via a &quot;package&quot; that provides (either
directly or by inheritance) methods (that is, subroutines)
to handle instances of the class (its objects). See also
&quot;inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p>class method A &quot;method&quot; whose
&quot;invocant&quot; is a &quot;package&quot; name, not an
&quot;object&quot; reference. A method associated with the
class as a whole.</p>

<p>client In networking, a &quot;process&quot; that
initiates contact with a &quot;server&quot; process in order
to exchange data and perhaps receive a service.</p>

<p>cloister A &quot;cluster&quot; used to restrict the
scope of a &quot;regular expression modifier&quot;.</p>

<p>closure An &quot;anonymous&quot; subroutine that, when a
reference to it is generated at run time, keeps track of the
identities of externally visible lexical variables even
after those lexical variables have supposedly gone out of
&quot;scope&quot;. They re called &quot;closures&quot;
because this sort of behavior gives mathematicians a sense
of closure.</p>

<p>cluster A parenthesized &quot;subpattern&quot; used to
group parts of a &quot;regular expression&quot; into a
single &quot;atom&quot;.</p>

<p>CODE The word returned by the ref function when you
apply it to a reference to a subroutine. See also
&quot;CV&quot;.</p>

<p>code generator A system that writes code for you in a
low-level language, such as code to implement the backend of
a compiler. See &quot;program generator&quot;.</p>

<p>code subpattern A &quot;regular expression&quot;
subpattern whose real purpose is to execute some Perl code,
for example, the &quot;(?{...})&quot; and
&quot;(??{...})&quot; subpatterns.</p>

<p>collating sequence The order into which characters sort.
This is used by &quot;string&quot; comparison routines to
decide, for example, where in this glossary to put
&quot;collating sequence&quot;.</p>

<p>command In &quot;shell&quot; programming, the syntactic
combination of a program name and its arguments. More
loosely, anything you type to a shell (a command
interpreter) that starts it doing something. Even more
loosely, a Perl &quot;statement&quot;, which might start
with a &quot;label&quot; and typically ends with a
semicolon.</p>

<p>command buffering A mechanism in Perl that lets you
store up the output of each Perl &quot;command&quot; and
then flush it out as a single request to the &quot;operating
system&quot;. It s enabled by setting the $| ($AUTOFLUSH)
variable to a true value. Its used when you dont want data
sitting around not going where its supposed to, which may
happen because the default on a &quot;file&quot; or
&quot;pipe&quot; is to use &quot;block buffering&quot;.</p>

<p>command name The name of the program currently
executing, as typed on the command line. In C, the
&quot;command&quot; name is passed to the program as the
first command-line argument. In Perl, it comes in separately
as $0.</p>

<p>command-line arguments The values you supply along with
a program name when you tell a &quot;shell&quot; to execute
a &quot;command&quot;. These values are passed to a Perl
program through @ARGV.</p>

<p>comment A remark that doesn t affect the meaning of the
program. In Perl, a comment is introduced by a &quot;#&quot;
character and continues to the end of the line.</p>

<p>compilation unit The &quot;file&quot; (or
&quot;string&quot;, in the case of eval) that is currently
being compiled.</p>

<p>compile phase Any time before Perl starts running your
main program. See also &quot;run phase&quot;. Compile phase
is mostly spent in &quot;compile time&quot;, but may also be
spent in &quot;run time&quot; when &quot;BEGIN&quot; blocks,
use declarations, or constant subexpressions are being
evaluated. The startup and import code of any use
declaration is also run during compile phase.</p>

<p>compile time The time when Perl is trying to make sense
of your code, as opposed to when it thinks it knows what
your code means and is merely trying to do what it thinks
your code says to do, which is &quot;run time&quot;.</p>

<p>compiler Strictly speaking, a program that munches up
another program and spits out yet another file containing
the program in a &quot;more executable&quot; form, typically
containing native machine instructions. The perl program is
not a compiler by this definition, but it does contain a
kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a
more executable form (syntax trees) within the perl process
itself, which the &quot;interpreter&quot; then interprets.
There are, however, extension modules to get Perl to act
more like a &quot;real&quot; compiler. See O.</p>

<p>composer A &quot;constructor&quot; for a
&quot;referent&quot; that isnt really an &quot;object&quot;,
like an anonymous array or a hash (or a sonata, for that
matter). For example, a pair of braces acts as a composer
for a hash, and a pair of brackets acts as a composer for an
array. See &quot;Making References&quot; in perlref.</p>

<p>concatenation The process of gluing one cats nose to
another cats tail. Also, a similar operation on two
strings.</p>

<p>conditional Something &quot;iffy&quot;. See
&quot;Boolean context&quot;.</p>

<p>connection In telephony, the temporary electrical
circuit between the callers and the callees phone. In
networking, the same kind of temporary circuit between a
&quot;client&quot; and a &quot;server&quot;.</p>

<p>construct As a noun, a piece of syntax made up of
smaller pieces. As a transitive verb, to create an
&quot;object&quot; using a &quot;constructor&quot;.</p>

<p>constructor Any &quot;class method&quot;, instance
&quot;method&quot;, or &quot;subroutine&quot; that composes,
initializes, blesses, and returns an &quot;object&quot;.
Sometimes we use the term loosely to mean a
&quot;composer&quot;.</p>

<p>context The surroundings, or environment. The context
given by the surrounding code determines what kind of data a
particular &quot;expression&quot; is expected to return. The
three primary contexts are &quot;list context&quot;,
&quot;scalar context&quot;, and &quot;void context&quot;.
Scalar context is sometimes subdivided into &quot;Boolean
context&quot;, &quot;numeric context&quot;, &quot;string
context&quot;, and &quot;void context&quot;. There s also a
&quot;dont care&quot; scalar context (which is dealt with in
Programming Perl, Third Edition, Chapter 2, &quot;Bits and
Pieces&quot; if you care).</p>

<p>continuation The treatment of more than one physical
&quot;line&quot; as a single logical line.
&quot;Makefile&quot; lines are continued by putting a
backslash before the &quot;newline&quot;. Mail headers as
defined by RFC 822 are continued by putting a space or tab
after the newline. In general, lines in Perl do not need any
form of continuation mark, because &quot;whitespace&quot;
(including newlines) is gleefully ignored. Usually.</p>

<p>core dump The corpse of a &quot;process&quot;, in the
form of a file left in the &quot;working directory&quot; of
the process, usually as a result of certain kinds of fatal
error.</p>

<p>CPAN The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. (See
&quot;What modules and extensions are available for Perl?
What is CPAN? What does CPAN/src/... mean?&quot; in
perlfaq2).</p>

<p>cracker Someone who breaks security on computer systems.
A cracker may be a true &quot;hacker&quot; or only a
&quot;script kiddie&quot;.</p>

<p>current package The &quot;package&quot; in which the
current statement is compiled. Scan backwards in the text of
your program through the current lexical scope or any
enclosing lexical scopes till you find a package
declaration. Thats your current package name.</p>

<p>current working directory See &quot;working
directory&quot;.</p>

<p>currently selected output channel The last
&quot;filehandle&quot; that was designated with
select(&quot;FILEHANDLE&quot;); &quot;STDOUT&quot;, if no
filehandle has been selected.</p>

<p>CV An internal &quot;code value&quot; typedef, holding a
&quot;subroutine&quot;. The &quot;CV&quot; type is a
subclass of &quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p>D dangling statement A bare, single
&quot;statement&quot;, without any braces, hanging off an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;while&quot; conditional. C allows
them. Perl doesnt.</p>

<p>data structure How your various pieces of data relate to
each other and what shape they make when you put them all
together, as in a rectangular table or a triangular-shaped
tree.</p>

<p>data type A set of possible values, together with all
the operations that know how to deal with those values. For
example, a numeric data type has a certain set of numbers
that you can work with and various mathematical operations
that you can do on the numbers but would make little sense
on, say, a string such as &quot;Kilroy&quot;. Strings have
their own operations, such as &quot;concatenation&quot;.
Compound types made of a number of smaller pieces generally
have operations to compose and decompose them, and perhaps
to rearrange them. Objects that model things in the real
world often have operations that correspond to real
activities. For instance, if you model an elevator, your
elevator object might have an &quot;open_door()&quot;
&quot;method&quot;.</p>

<p>datagram A packet of data, such as a &quot;UDP&quot;
message, that (from the viewpoint of the programs involved)
can be sent independently over the network. (In fact, all
packets are sent independently at the &quot;IP&quot; level,
but &quot;stream&quot; protocols such as &quot;TCP&quot;
hide this from your program.)</p>

<p>DBM Stands for &quot;Data Base Management&quot;
routines, a set of routines that emulate an
&quot;associative array&quot; using disk files. The routines
use a dynamic hashing scheme to locate any entry with only
two disk accesses. DBM files allow a Perl program to keep a
persistent &quot;hash&quot; across multiple invocations. You
can tie your hash variables to various DBM
implementations--see AnyDBM_File and DB_File.</p>

<p>declaration An &quot;assertion&quot; that states
something exists and perhaps describes what its like,
without giving any commitment as to how or where you ll use
it. A declaration is like the part of your recipe that says,
&quot;two cups flour, one large egg, four or five
tadpoles...&quot; See &quot;statement&quot; for its
opposite. Note that some declarations also function as
statements. Subroutine declarations also act as definitions
if a body is supplied.</p>

<p>decrement To subtract a value from a variable, as in
&quot;decrement $x&quot; (meaning to remove 1 from its
value) or &quot;decrement $x by 3&quot;.</p>

<p>default A &quot;value&quot; chosen for you if you dont
supply a value of your own.</p>

<p>defined Having a meaning. Perl thinks that some of the
things people try to do are devoid of meaning, in
particular, making use of variables that have never been
given a &quot;value&quot; and performing certain operations
on data that isnt there. For example, if you try to read
data past the end of a file, Perl will hand you back an
undefined value. See also &quot;false&quot; and
&quot;defined&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>delimiter A &quot;character&quot; or &quot;string&quot;
that sets bounds to an arbitrarily-sized textual object, not
to be confused with a &quot;separator&quot; or
&quot;terminator&quot;. &quot;To delimit&quot; really just
means &quot;to surround&quot; or &quot;to enclose&quot;
(like these parentheses are doing).</p>

<p>deprecated modules and features Deprecated modules and
features are those which were part of a stable release, but
later found to be subtly flawed, and which should be
avoided. They are subject to removal and/or bug-
incompatible reimplementation in the next major release (but
they will be preserved through maintenance releases).
Deprecation warnings are issued under -w or &quot;use
diagnostics&quot;, and notices are found in perldeltas, as
well as various other PODs. Coding practices that misuse
features, such as &quot;my $foo if 0&quot;, can also be
deprecated.</p>

<p>dereference A fancy computer science term meaning
&quot;to follow a &quot;reference&quot; to what it points
to&quot;. The &quot;de&quot; part of it refers to the fact
that youre taking away one level of
&quot;indirection&quot;.</p>

<p>derived class A &quot;class&quot; that defines some of
its methods in terms of a more generic class, called a
&quot;base class&quot;. Note that classes arent classified
exclusively into base classes or derived classes: a class
can function as both a derived class and a base class
simultaneously, which is kind of classy.</p>

<p>descriptor See &quot;file descriptor&quot;.</p>

<p>destroy To deallocate the memory of a
&quot;referent&quot; (first triggering its
&quot;DESTROY&quot; method, if it has one).</p>

<p>destructor A special &quot;method&quot; that is called
when an &quot;object&quot; is thinking about destroying
itself. A Perl program s &quot;DESTROY&quot; method doesnt
do the actual destruction; Perl just triggers the method in
case the &quot;class&quot; wants to do any associated
cleanup.</p>

<p>device A whiz-bang hardware gizmo (like a disk or tape
drive or a modem or a joystick or a mouse) attached to your
computer, that the &quot;operating system&quot; tries to
make look like a &quot;file&quot; (or a bunch of files).
Under Unix, these fake files tend to live in the /dev
directory.</p>

<p>directive A &quot;pod&quot; directive. See perlpod.</p>

<p>directory A special file that contains other files. Some
operating systems call these &quot;folders&quot;,
&quot;drawers&quot;, or &quot;catalogs&quot;.</p>

<p>directory handle A name that represents a particular
instance of opening a directory to read it, until you close
it. See the opendir function.</p>

<p>dispatch To send something to its correct destination.
Often used metaphorically to indicate a transfer of
programmatic control to a destination selected
algorithmically, often by lookup in a table of function
references or, in the case of object methods, by traversing
the inheritance tree looking for the most specific
definition for the method.</p>

<p>distribution A standard, bundled release of a system of
software. The default usage implies source code is included.
If that is not the case, it will be called a
&quot;binary-only&quot; distribution.</p>

<p>(to be) dropped modules When Perl 5 was first released
(see perlhistory), several modules were included, which have
now fallen out of common use. It has been suggested that
these modules should be removed, since the distribution
became rather large, and the common criterion for new module
additions is now limited to modules that help to build,
test, and extend perl itself. Furthermore, the CPAN (which
didnt exist at the time of Perl 5.0) can become the new home
of dropped modules. Dropping modules is currently not an
option, but further developments may clear the last
barriers.</p>

<p>dweomer An enchantment, illusion, phantasm, or jugglery.
Said when Perls magical &quot;dwimmer&quot; effects dont do
what you expect, but rather seem to be the product of arcane
dweomercraft, sorcery, or wonder working. [From Old
English]</p>

<p>dwimmer DWIM is an acronym for &quot;Do What I
Mean&quot;, the principle that something should just do what
you want it to do without an undue amount of fuss. A bit of
code that does &quot;dwimming&quot; is a
&quot;dwimmer&quot;. Dwimming can require a great deal of
behind-the-scenes magic, which (if it doesn t stay properly
behind the scenes) is called a &quot;dweomer&quot;
instead.</p>

<p>dynamic scoping Dynamic scoping works over a dynamic
scope, making variables visible throughout the rest of the
&quot;block&quot; in which they are first used and in any
subroutines that are called by the rest of the block.
Dynamically scoped variables can have their values
temporarily changed (and implicitly restored later) by a
local operator. (Compare &quot;lexical scoping&quot;.) Used
more loosely to mean how a subroutine that is in the middle
of calling another subroutine &quot;contains&quot; that
subroutine at &quot;run time&quot;.</p>

<p>E eclectic Derived from many sources. Some would say too
many.</p>

<p>element A basic building block. When youre talking about
an &quot;array&quot;, its one of the items that make up the
array.</p>

<p>embedding When something is contained in something else,
particularly when that might be considered surprising:
&quot;Ive embedded a complete Perl interpreter in my
editor!&quot;</p>

<p>empty subclass test The notion that an empty
&quot;derived class&quot; should behave exactly like its
&quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p>en passant When you change a &quot;value&quot; as it is
being copied. [From French, &quot;in passing&quot;, as in
the exotic pawn-capturing maneuver in chess.]</p>

<p>encapsulation The veil of abstraction separating the
&quot;interface&quot; from the &quot;implementation&quot;
(whether enforced or not), which mandates that all access to
an &quot;object&quot;s state be through methods alone.</p>

<p>endian See &quot;little-endian&quot; and
&quot;big-endian&quot;.</p>

<p>environment The collective set of environment variables
your &quot;process&quot; inherits from its parent. Accessed
via %ENV.</p>

<p>environment variable A mechanism by which some
high-level agent such as a user can pass its preferences
down to its future offspring (child processes, grandchild
processes, great-grandchild processes, and so on). Each
environment variable is a &quot;key&quot;/&quot;value&quot;
pair, like one entry in a &quot;hash&quot;.</p>

<p>EOF End of File. Sometimes used metaphorically as the
terminating string of a &quot;here document&quot;.</p>

<p>errno The error number returned by a &quot;syscall&quot;
when it fails. Perl refers to the error by the name $! (or
$OS_ERROR if you use the English module).</p>

<p>error See &quot;exception&quot; or &quot;fatal
error&quot;.</p>

<p>escape sequence See &quot;metasymbol&quot;.</p>

<p>exception A fancy term for an error. See &quot;fatal
error&quot;.</p>

<p>exception handling The way a program responds to an
error. The exception handling mechanism in Perl is the eval
operator.</p>

<p>exec To throw away the current &quot;process&quot; s
program and replace it with another without exiting the
process or relinquishing any resources held (apart from the
old memory image).</p>

<p>executable file A &quot;file&quot; that is specially
marked to tell the &quot;operating system&quot; that its
okay to run this file as a program. Usually shortened to
&quot;executable&quot;.</p>

<p>execute To run a program or &quot;subroutine&quot;. (Has
nothing to do with the kill built-in, unless you re trying
to run a &quot;signal handler&quot;.)</p>

<p>execute bit The special mark that tells the operating
system it can run this program. There are actually three
execute bits under Unix, and which bit gets used depends on
whether you own the file singularly, collectively, or not at
all.</p>

<p>exit status See &quot;status&quot;.</p>

<p>export To make symbols from a &quot;module&quot;
available for &quot;import&quot; by other modules.</p>

<p>expression Anything you can legally say in a spot where
a &quot;value&quot; is required. Typically composed of
literals, variables, operators, functions, and
&quot;subroutine&quot; calls, not necessarily in that
order.</p>

<p>extension A Perl module that also pulls in compiled C or
C++ code. More generally, any experimental option that can
be compiled into Perl, such as multithreading.</p>

<p>F false In Perl, any value that would look like
&quot;&quot; or &quot;0&quot; if evaluated in a string
context. Since undefined values evaluate to &quot;&quot;,
all undefined values are false, but not all false values are
undefined.</p>

<p>FAQ Frequently Asked Question (although not necessarily
frequently answered, especially if the answer appears in the
Perl FAQ shipped standard with Perl).</p>

<p>fatal error An uncaught &quot;exception&quot;, which
causes termination of the &quot;process&quot; after printing
a message on your &quot;standard error&quot; stream. Errors
that happen inside an eval are not fatal. Instead, the eval
terminates after placing the exception message in the $@
($EVAL_ERROR) variable. You can try to provoke a fatal error
with the die operator (known as throwing or raising an
exception), but this may be caught by a dynamically
enclosing eval. If not caught, the die becomes a fatal
error.</p>

<p>field A single piece of numeric or string data that is
part of a longer &quot;string&quot;, &quot;record&quot;, or
&quot;line&quot;. Variable-width fields are usually split up
by separators (so use split to extract the fields), while
fixed-width fields are usually at fixed positions (so use
unpack). Instance variables are also known as fields.</p>

<p>FIFO First In, First Out. See also &quot;LIFO&quot;.
Also, a nickname for a &quot;named pipe&quot;.</p>

<p>file A named collection of data, usually stored on disk
in a &quot;directory&quot; in a &quot;filesystem&quot;.
Roughly like a document, if you re into office metaphors. In
modern filesystems, you can actually give a file more than
one name. Some files have special properties, like
directories and devices.</p>

<p>file descriptor The little number the &quot;operating
system&quot; uses to keep track of which opened
&quot;file&quot; youre talking about. Perl hides the file
descriptor inside a &quot;standard I/O&quot; stream and then
attaches the stream to a &quot;filehandle&quot;.</p>

<p>file test operator A built-in unary operator that you
use to determine whether something is &quot;true&quot; about
a file, such as &quot;-o $filename&quot; to test whether
youre the owner of the file.</p>

<p>fileglob A &quot;wildcard&quot; match on filenames. See
the glob function.</p>

<p>filehandle An identifier (not necessarily related to the
real name of a file) that represents a particular instance
of opening a file until you close it. If youre going to open
and close several different files in succession, its fine to
open each of them with the same filehandle, so you don t
have to write out separate code to process each file.</p>

<p>filename One name for a file. This name is listed in a
&quot;directory&quot;, and you can use it in an open to tell
the &quot;operating system&quot; exactly which file you want
to open, and associate the file with a
&quot;filehandle&quot; which will carry the subsequent
identity of that file in your program, until you close
it.</p>

<p>filesystem A set of directories and files residing on a
partition of the disk. Sometimes known as a
&quot;partition&quot;. You can change the files name or even
move a file around from directory to directory within a
filesystem without actually moving the file itself, at least
under Unix.</p>

<p>filter A program designed to take a &quot;stream&quot;
of input and transform it into a stream of output.</p>

<p>flag We tend to avoid this term because it means so many
things. It may mean a command-line &quot;switch&quot; that
takes no argument itself (such as Perl s -n and -p flags)
or, less frequently, a single-bit indicator (such as the
&quot;O_CREAT&quot; and &quot;O_EXCL&quot; flags used in
sysopen).</p>

<p>floating point A method of storing numbers in
&quot;scientific notation&quot;, such that the precision of
the number is independent of its magnitude (the decimal
point &quot;floats&quot;). Perl does its numeric work with
floating- point numbers (sometimes called
&quot;floats&quot;), when it can t get away with using
integers. Floating-point numbers are mere approximations of
real numbers.</p>

<p>flush The act of emptying a &quot;buffer&quot;, often
before its full.</p>

<p>FMTEYEWTK Far More Than Everything You Ever Wanted To
Know. An exhaustive treatise on one narrow topic, something
of a super-&quot;FAQ&quot;. See Tom for far more.</p>

<p>fork To create a child &quot;process&quot; identical to
the parent process at its moment of conception, at least
until it gets ideas of its own. A thread with protected
memory.</p>

<p>formal arguments The generic names by which a
&quot;subroutine&quot; knows its arguments. In many
languages, formal arguments are always given individual
names, but in Perl, the formal arguments are just the
elements of an array. The formal arguments to a Perl program
are $ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], and so on. Similarly, the formal
arguments to a Perl subroutine are $_[0], $_[1], and so on.
You may give the arguments individual names by assigning the
values to a my list. See also &quot;actual
arguments&quot;.</p>

<p>format A specification of how many spaces and digits and
things to put somewhere so that whatever youre printing
comes out nice and pretty.</p>

<p>freely available Means you don t have to pay money to
get it, but the copyright on it may still belong to someone
else (like Larry).</p>

<p>freely redistributable Means youre not in legal trouble
if you give a bootleg copy of it to your friends and we find
out about it. In fact, we d rather you gave a copy to all
your friends.</p>

<p>freeware Historically, any software that you give away,
particularly if you make the source code available as well.
Now often called &quot;open source software&quot;. Recently
there has been a trend to use the term in contradistinction
to &quot;open source software&quot;, to refer only to free
software released under the Free Software Foundations GPL
(General Public License), but this is difficult to justify
etymologically.</p>

<p>function Mathematically, a mapping of each of a set of
input values to a particular output value. In computers,
refers to a &quot;subroutine&quot; or &quot;operator&quot;
that returns a &quot;value&quot;. It may or may not have
input values (called arguments).</p>

<p>funny character Someone like Larry, or one of his
peculiar friends. Also refers to the strange prefixes that
Perl requires as noun markers on its variables.</p>

<p>garbage collection A misnamed feature--it should be
called, &quot;expecting your mother to pick up after
you&quot;. Strictly speaking, Perl doesnt do this, but it
relies on a reference-counting mechanism to keep things
tidy. However, we rarely speak strictly and will often refer
to the reference-counting scheme as a form of garbage
collection. (If its any comfort, when your interpreter
exits, a &quot;real&quot; garbage collector runs to make
sure everything is cleaned up if youve been messy with
circular references and such.)</p>

<p>G GID Group ID--in Unix, the numeric group ID that the
&quot;operating system&quot; uses to identify you and
members of your &quot;group&quot;.</p>

<p>glob Strictly, the shells &quot;*&quot; character, which
will match a &quot;glob&quot; of characters when youre
trying to generate a list of filenames. Loosely, the act of
using globs and similar symbols to do pattern matching. See
also &quot;fileglob&quot; and &quot;typeglob&quot;.</p>

<p>global Something you can see from anywhere, usually used
of variables and subroutines that are visible everywhere in
your program. In Perl, only certain special variables are
truly global--most variables (and all subroutines) exist
only in the current &quot;package&quot;. Global variables
can be declared with our. See &quot;our&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p>global destruction The &quot;garbage collection&quot; of
globals (and the running of any associated object
destructors) that takes place when a Perl
&quot;interpreter&quot; is being shut down. Global
destruction should not be confused with the Apocalypse,
except perhaps when it should.</p>

<p>glue language A language such as Perl that is good at
hooking things together that werent intended to be hooked
together.</p>

<p>granularity The size of the pieces youre dealing with,
mentally speaking.</p>

<p>greedy A &quot;subpattern&quot; whose
&quot;quantifier&quot; wants to match as many things as
possible.</p>

<p>grep Originally from the old Unix editor command for
&quot;Globally search for a Regular Expression and Print
it&quot;, now used in the general sense of any kind of
search, especially text searches. Perl has a built-in grep
function that searches a list for elements matching any
given criterion, whereas the grep(1) program searches for
lines matching a &quot;regular expression&quot; in one or
more files.</p>

<p>group A set of users of which you are a member. In some
operating systems (like Unix), you can give certain file
access permissions to other members of your group.</p>

<p>GV An internal &quot;glob value&quot; typedef, holding a
&quot;typeglob&quot;. The &quot;GV&quot; type is a subclass
of &quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p>H hacker Someone who is brilliantly persistent in
solving technical problems, whether these involve golfing,
fighting orcs, or programming. Hacker is a neutral term,
morally speaking. Good hackers are not to be confused with
evil crackers or clueless script kiddies. If you confuse
them, we will presume that you are either evil or
clueless.</p>

<p>handler A &quot;subroutine&quot; or &quot;method&quot;
that is called by Perl when your program needs to respond to
some internal event, such as a &quot;signal&quot;, or an
encounter with an operator subject to &quot;operator
overloading&quot;. See also &quot;callback&quot;.</p>

<p>hard reference A &quot;scalar&quot; &quot;value&quot;
containing the actual address of a &quot;referent&quot;,
such that the referents &quot;reference&quot; count accounts
for it. (Some hard references are held internally, such as
the implicit reference from one of a &quot;typeglob&quot; s
variable slots to its corresponding referent.) A hard
reference is different from a &quot;symbolic
reference&quot;.</p>

<p>hash An unordered association of
&quot;key&quot;/&quot;value&quot; pairs, stored such that
you can easily use a string &quot;key&quot; to look up its
associated data &quot;value&quot;. This glossary is like a
hash, where the word to be defined is the key, and the
definition is the value. A hash is also sometimes
septisyllabically called an &quot;associative array&quot;,
which is a pretty good reason for simply calling it a
&quot;hash&quot; instead.</p>

<p>hash table A data structure used internally by Perl for
implementing associative arrays (hashes) efficiently. See
also &quot;bucket&quot;.</p>

<p>header file A file containing certain required
definitions that you must include &quot;ahead&quot; of the
rest of your program to do certain obscure operations. A C
header file has a .h extension. Perl doesnt really have
header files, though historically Perl has sometimes used
translated .h files with a .ph extension. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc. (Header files have been
superseded by the &quot;module&quot; mechanism.)</p>

<p>here document So called because of a similar construct
in shells that pretends that the lines following the
&quot;command&quot; are a separate &quot;file&quot; to be
fed to the command, up to some terminating string. In Perl,
however, its just a fancy form of quoting.</p>

<p>hexadecimal A number in base 16, &quot;hex&quot; for
short. The digits for 10 through 16 are customarily
represented by the letters &quot;a&quot; through
&quot;f&quot;. Hexadecimal constants in Perl start with
&quot;0x&quot;. See also &quot;hex&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>home directory The directory you are put into when you
log in. On a Unix system, the name is often placed into
$ENV{HOME} or $ENV{LOGDIR} by login, but you can also find
it with &quot;(getpwuid($&lt;))[7]&quot;. (Some platforms do
not have a concept of a home directory.)</p>

<p>host The computer on which a program or other data
resides.</p>

<p>hubris Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you
for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain)
programs that other people wont want to say bad things
about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See
also &quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;impatience&quot;.</p>

<p>HV Short for a &quot;hash value&quot; typedef, which
holds Perl s internal representation of a hash. The
&quot;HV&quot; type is a subclass of &quot;SV&quot;.</p>

<p>I identifier A legally formed name for most anything in
which a computer program might be interested. Many languages
(including Perl) allow identifiers that start with a letter
and contain letters and digits. Perl also counts the
underscore character as a valid letter. (Perl also has more
complicated names, such as &quot;qualified&quot; names.)</p>

<p>impatience The anger you feel when the computer is being
lazy. This makes you write programs that dont just react to
your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least that
pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer.
See also &quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;hubris&quot;.</p>

<p>implementation How a piece of code actually goes about
doing its job. Users of the code should not count on
implementation details staying the same unless they are part
of the published &quot;interface&quot;.</p>

<p>import To gain access to symbols that are exported from
another module. See &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>increment To increase the value of something by 1 (or by
some other number, if so specified).</p>

<p>indexing In olden days, the act of looking up a
&quot;key&quot; in an actual index (such as a phone book),
but now merely the act of using any kind of key or position
to find the corresponding &quot;value&quot;, even if no
index is involved. Things have degenerated to the point that
Perls index function merely locates the position (index) of
one string in another.</p>

<p>indirect filehandle An &quot;expression&quot; that
evaluates to something that can be used as a
&quot;filehandle&quot;: a &quot;string&quot; (filehandle
name), a &quot;typeglob&quot;, a typeglob
&quot;reference&quot;, or a low-level &quot;IO&quot;
object.</p>

<p>indirect object In English grammar, a short noun phrase
between a verb and its direct object indicating the
beneficiary or recipient of the action. In Perl, &quot;print
STDOUT &quot;$foo0;&quot; can be understood as &quot;verb
indirect-object object&quot; where &quot;STDOUT&quot; is the
recipient of the print action, and &quot;$foo&quot; is the
object being printed. Similarly, when invoking a
&quot;method&quot;, you might place the invocant between the
method and its arguments:</p>

<p>$gollum = new Pathetic::Creature &quot;Smeagol&quot;;
give $gollum &quot;Fisssssh!&quot;; give $gollum
&quot;Precious!&quot;;</p>

<p>In modern Perl, calling methods this way is often
considered bad practice and to be avoided.</p>

<p>indirect object slot The syntactic position falling
between a method call and its arguments when using the
indirect object invocation syntax. (The slot is
distinguished by the absence of a comma between it and the
next argument.) &quot;STDERR&quot; is in the indirect object
slot here:</p>

<p>print STDERR &quot;Awake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes!
Awake!0;</p>

<p>indirection If something in a program isnt the value
youre looking for but indicates where the value is, thats
indirection. This can be done with either symbolic
references or hard references.</p>

<p>infix An &quot;operator&quot; that comes in between its
operands, such as multiplication in &quot;24 * 7&quot;.</p>

<p>inheritance What you get from your ancestors,
genetically or otherwise. If you happen to be a
&quot;class&quot;, your ancestors are called base classes
and your descendants are called derived classes. See
&quot;single inheritance&quot; and &quot;multiple
inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p>instance Short for &quot;an instance of a class&quot;,
meaning an &quot;object&quot; of that &quot;class&quot;.</p>

<p>instance variable An &quot;attribute&quot; of an
&quot;object&quot;; data stored with the particular object
rather than with the class as a whole.</p>

<p>integer A number with no fractional (decimal) part. A
counting number, like 1, 2, 3, and so on, but including 0
and the negatives.</p>

<p>interface The services a piece of code promises to
provide forever, in contrast to its
&quot;implementation&quot;, which it should feel free to
change whenever it likes.</p>

<p>interpolation The insertion of a scalar or list value
somewhere in the middle of another value, such that it
appears to have been there all along. In Perl, variable
interpolation happens in double-quoted strings and patterns,
and list interpolation occurs when constructing the list of
values to pass to a list operator or other such construct
that takes a &quot;LIST&quot;.</p>

<p>interpreter Strictly speaking, a program that reads a
second program and does what the second program says
directly without turning the program into a different form
first, which is what compilers do. Perl is not an
interpreter by this definition, because it contains a kind
of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more
executable form (syntax trees) within the perl process
itself, which the Perl &quot;run time&quot; system then
interprets.</p>

<p>invocant The agent on whose behalf a &quot;method&quot;
is invoked. In a &quot;class&quot; method, the invocant is a
package name. In an &quot;instance&quot; method, the
invocant is an object reference.</p>

<p>invocation The act of calling up a deity, daemon,
program, method, subroutine, or function to get it do what
you think it s supposed to do. We usually &quot;call&quot;
subroutines but &quot;invoke&quot; methods, since it sounds
cooler.</p>

<p>I/O Input from, or output to, a &quot;file&quot; or
&quot;device&quot;.</p>

<p>IO An internal I/O object. Can also mean &quot;indirect
object&quot;.</p>

<p>IP Internet Protocol, or Intellectual Property.</p>

<p>IPC Interprocess Communication.</p>

<p>is-a A relationship between two objects in which one
object is considered to be a more specific version of the
other, generic object: &quot;A camel is a mammal.&quot;
Since the generic object really only exists in a Platonic
sense, we usually add a little abstraction to the notion of
objects and think of the relationship as being between a
generic &quot;base class&quot; and a specific &quot;derived
class&quot;. Oddly enough, Platonic classes dont always have
Platonic relationships--see &quot;inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p>iteration Doing something repeatedly.</p>

<p>iterator A special programming gizmo that keeps track of
where you are in something that you re trying to iterate
over. The &quot;foreach&quot; loop in Perl contains an
iterator; so does a hash, allowing you to each through
it.</p>

<p>IV The integer four, not to be confused with six, Toms
favorite editor. IV also means an internal Integer Value of
the type a &quot;scalar&quot; can hold, not to be confused
with an &quot;NV&quot;.</p>

<p>J JAPH &quot;Just Another Perl Hacker,&quot; a clever
but cryptic bit of Perl code that when executed, evaluates
to that string. Often used to illustrate a particular Perl
feature, and something of an ongoing Obfuscated Perl Contest
seen in Usenix signatures.</p>

<p>K key The string index to a &quot;hash&quot;, used to
look up the &quot;value&quot; associated with that key.</p>

<p>keyword See &quot;reserved words&quot;.</p>

<p>L label A name you give to a &quot;statement&quot; so
that you can talk about that statement elsewhere in the
program.</p>

<p>laziness The quality that makes you go to great effort
to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write
labor-saving programs that other people will find useful,
and document what you wrote so you don t have to answer so
many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a
programmer. Also hence, this book. See also
&quot;impatience&quot; and &quot;hubris&quot;.</p>

<p>left shift A &quot;bit shift&quot; that multiplies the
number by some power of 2.</p>

<p>leftmost longest The preference of the &quot;regular
expression&quot; engine to match the leftmost occurrence of
a &quot;pattern&quot;, then given a position at which a
match will occur, the preference for the longest match
(presuming the use of a &quot;greedy&quot; quantifier). See
perlre for much more on this subject.</p>

<p>lexeme Fancy term for a &quot;token&quot;.</p>

<p>lexer Fancy term for a &quot;tokener&quot;.</p>

<p>lexical analysis Fancy term for
&quot;tokenizing&quot;.</p>

<p>lexical scoping Looking at your Oxford English
Dictionary through a microscope. (Also known as &quot;static
scoping&quot;, because dictionaries dont change very fast.)
Similarly, looking at variables stored in a private
dictionary (namespace) for each scope, which are visible
only from their point of declaration down to the end of the
lexical scope in which they are declared. --Syn.
&quot;static scoping&quot;. --Ant. &quot;dynamic
scoping&quot;.</p>

<p>lexical variable A &quot;variable&quot; subject to
&quot;lexical scoping&quot;, declared by my. Often just
called a &quot;lexical&quot;. (The our declaration declares
a lexically scoped name for a global variable, which is not
itself a lexical variable.)</p>

<p>library Generally, a collection of procedures. In
ancient days, referred to a collection of subroutines in a
.pl file. In modern times, refers more often to the entire
collection of Perl modules on your system.</p>

<p>LIFO Last In, First Out. See also &quot;FIFO&quot;. A
LIFO is usually called a &quot;stack&quot;.</p>

<p>line In Unix, a sequence of zero or more non-newline
characters terminated with a &quot;newline&quot; character.
On non-Unix machines, this is emulated by the C library even
if the underlying &quot;operating system&quot; has different
ideas.</p>

<p>line buffering Used by a &quot;standard I/O&quot; output
stream that flushes its &quot;buffer&quot; after every
&quot;newline&quot;. Many standard I/O libraries
automatically set up line buffering on output that is going
to the terminal.</p>

<p>line number The number of lines read previous to this
one, plus 1. Perl keeps a separate line number for each
source or input file it opens. The current source file s
line number is represented by &quot;__LINE__&quot;. The
current input line number (for the file that was most
recently read via &quot;E&lt;lt&gt;FHE&lt;gt&gt;&quot;) is
represented by the $. ($INPUT_LINE_NUMBER) variable. Many
error messages report both values, if available.</p>

<p>link Used as a noun, a name in a &quot;directory&quot;,
representing a &quot;file&quot;. A given file can have
multiple links to it. Its like having the same phone number
listed in the phone directory under different names. As a
verb, to resolve a partially compiled files unresolved
symbols into a (nearly) executable image. Linking can
generally be static or dynamic, which has nothing to do with
static or dynamic scoping.</p>

<p>LIST A syntactic construct representing a
comma-separated list of expressions, evaluated to produce a
&quot;list value&quot;. Each &quot;expression&quot; in a
&quot;LIST&quot; is evaluated in &quot;list context&quot;
and interpolated into the list value.</p>

<p>list An ordered set of scalar values.</p>

<p>list context The situation in which an
&quot;expression&quot; is expected by its surroundings (the
code calling it) to return a list of values rather than a
single value. Functions that want a &quot;LIST&quot; of
arguments tell those arguments that they should produce a
list value. See also &quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p>list operator An &quot;operator&quot; that does
something with a list of values, such as join or grep.
Usually used for named built-in operators (such as print,
unlink, and system) that do not require parentheses around
their &quot;argument&quot; list.</p>

<p>list value An unnamed list of temporary scalar values
that may be passed around within a program from any
list-generating function to any function or construct that
provides a &quot;list context&quot;.</p>

<p>literal A token in a programming language such as a
number or &quot;string&quot; that gives you an actual
&quot;value&quot; instead of merely representing possible
values as a &quot;variable&quot; does.</p>

<p>little-endian From Swift: someone who eats eggs little
end first. Also used of computers that store the least
significant &quot;byte&quot; of a word at a lower byte
address than the most significant byte. Often considered
superior to big-endian machines. See also
&quot;big-endian&quot;.</p>

<p>local Not meaning the same thing everywhere. A global
variable in Perl can be localized inside a dynamic scope via
the local operator.</p>

<p>logical operator Symbols representing the concepts
&quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;xor&quot;, and
&quot;not&quot;.</p>

<p>lookahead An &quot;assertion&quot; that peeks at the
string to the right of the current match location.</p>

<p>lookbehind An &quot;assertion&quot; that peeks at the
string to the left of the current match location.</p>

<p>loop A construct that performs something repeatedly,
like a roller coaster.</p>

<p>loop control statement Any statement within the body of
a loop that can make a loop prematurely stop looping or skip
an &quot;iteration&quot;. Generally you shouldnt try this on
roller coasters.</p>

<p>loop label A kind of key or name attached to a loop (or
roller coaster) so that loop control statements can talk
about which loop they want to control.</p>

<p>lvaluable Able to serve as an &quot;lvalue&quot;.</p>

<p>lvalue Term used by language lawyers for a storage
location you can assign a new &quot;value&quot; to, such as
a &quot;variable&quot; or an element of an
&quot;array&quot;. The &quot;l&quot; is short for
&quot;left&quot;, as in the left side of an assignment, a
typical place for lvalues. An &quot;lvaluable&quot; function
or expression is one to which a value may be assigned, as in
&quot;pos($x) = 10&quot;.</p>

<p>lvalue modifier An adjectival pseudofunction that warps
the meaning of an &quot;lvalue&quot; in some declarative
fashion. Currently there are three lvalue modifiers: my,
our, and local.</p>

<p>M magic Technically speaking, any extra semantics
attached to a variable such as $!, $0, %ENV, or %SIG, or to
any tied variable. Magical things happen when you diddle
those variables.</p>

<p>magical increment An &quot;increment&quot; operator that
knows how to bump up alphabetics as well as numbers.</p>

<p>magical variables Special variables that have side
effects when you access them or assign to them. For example,
in Perl, changing elements of the %ENV array also changes
the corresponding environment variables that subprocesses
will use. Reading the $! variable gives you the current
system error number or message.</p>

<p>Makefile A file that controls the compilation of a
program. Perl programs dont usually need a
&quot;Makefile&quot; because the Perl compiler has plenty of
self-control.</p>

<p>man The Unix program that displays online documentation
(manual pages) for you.</p>

<p>manpage A &quot;page&quot; from the manuals, typically
accessed via the man(1) command. A manpage contains a
SYNOPSIS, a DESCRIPTION, a list of BUGS, and so on, and is
typically longer than a page. There are manpages documenting
commands, syscalls, &quot;library&quot; functions, devices,
protocols, files, and such. In this book, we call any piece
of standard Perl documentation (like perlop or perldelta) a
manpage, no matter what format it s installed in on your
system.</p>

<p>matching See &quot;pattern matching&quot;.</p>

<p>member data See &quot;instance variable&quot;.</p>

<p>memory This always means your main memory, not your
disk. Clouding the issue is the fact that your machine may
implement &quot;virtual&quot; memory; that is, it will
pretend that it has more memory than it really does, and
itll use disk space to hold inactive bits. This can make it
seem like you have a little more memory than you really do,
but its not a substitute for real memory. The best thing
that can be said about virtual memory is that it lets your
performance degrade gradually rather than suddenly when you
run out of real memory. But your program can die when you
run out of virtual memory too, if you havent thrashed your
disk to death first.</p>

<p>metacharacter A &quot;character&quot; that is not
supposed to be treated normally. Which characters are to be
treated specially as metacharacters varies greatly from
context to context. Your &quot;shell&quot; will have certain
metacharacters, double-quoted Perl strings have other
metacharacters, and &quot;regular expression&quot; patterns
have all the double-quote metacharacters plus some extra
ones of their own.</p>

<p>metasymbol Something wed call a
&quot;metacharacter&quot; except that its a sequence of more
than one character. Generally, the first character in the
sequence must be a true metacharacter to get the other
characters in the metasymbol to misbehave along with it.</p>

<p>method A kind of action that an &quot;object&quot; can
take if you tell it to. See perlobj.</p>

<p>minimalism The belief that &quot;small is
beautiful.&quot; Paradoxically, if you say something in a
small language, it turns out big, and if you say it in a big
language, it turns out small. Go figure.</p>

<p>mode In the context of the stat syscall, refers to the
field holding the &quot;permission bits&quot; and the type
of the &quot;file&quot;.</p>

<p>modifier See &quot;statement modifier&quot;,
&quot;regular expression modifier&quot;, and &quot;lvalue
modifier&quot;, not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>module A &quot;file&quot; that defines a
&quot;package&quot; of (almost) the same name, which can
either &quot;export&quot; symbols or function as an
&quot;object&quot; class. (A modules main .pm file may also
load in other files in support of the module.) See the use
built-in.</p>

<p>modulus An integer divisor when you re interested in the
remainder instead of the quotient.</p>

<p>monger Short for Perl Monger, a purveyor of Perl.</p>

<p>mortal A temporary value scheduled to die when the
current statement finishes.</p>

<p>multidimensional array An array with multiple subscripts
for finding a single element. Perl implements these using
references--see perllol and perldsc.</p>

<p>multiple inheritance The features you got from your
mother and father, mixed together unpredictably. (See also
&quot;inheritance&quot;, and &quot;single
inheritance&quot;.) In computer languages (including Perl),
the notion that a given class may have multiple direct
ancestors or base classes.</p>

<p>N named pipe A &quot;pipe&quot; with a name embedded in
the &quot;filesystem&quot; so that it can be accessed by two
unrelated processes.</p>

<p>namespace A domain of names. You neednt worry about
whether the names in one such domain have been used in
another. See &quot;package&quot;.</p>

<p>network address The most important attribute of a
socket, like your telephones telephone number. Typically an
IP address. See also &quot;port&quot;.</p>

<p>newline A single character that represents the end of a
line, with the ASCII value of 012 octal under Unix (but 015
on a Mac), and represented by &quot;0 in Perl strings. For
Windows machines writing text files, and for certain
physical devices like terminals, the single newline gets
automatically translated by your C library into a line feed
and a carriage return, but normally, no translation is
done.</p>

<p>NFS Network File System, which allows you to mount a
remote filesystem as if it were local.</p>

<p>null character A character with the ASCII value of zero.
Its used by C to terminate strings, but Perl allows strings
to contain a null.</p>

<p>null list A &quot;list value&quot; with zero elements,
represented in Perl by &quot;()&quot;.</p>

<p>null string A &quot;string&quot; containing no
characters, not to be confused with a string containing a
&quot;null character&quot;, which has a positive length and
is &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p>numeric context The situation in which an expression is
expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return
a number. See also &quot;context&quot; and &quot;string
context&quot;.</p>

<p>NV Short for Nevada, no part of which will ever be
confused with civilization. NV also means an internal
floating-point Numeric Value of the type a
&quot;scalar&quot; can hold, not to be confused with an
&quot;IV&quot;.</p>

<p>nybble Half a &quot;byte&quot;, equivalent to one
&quot;hexadecimal&quot; digit, and worth four bits.</p>

<p>O object An &quot;instance&quot; of a &quot;class&quot;.
Something that &quot;knows&quot; what user- defined type
(class) it is, and what it can do because of what class it
is. Your program can request an object to do things, but the
object gets to decide whether it wants to do them or not.
Some objects are more accommodating than others.</p>

<p>octal A number in base 8. Only the digits 0 through 7
are allowed. Octal constants in Perl start with 0, as in
013. See also the oct function.</p>

<p>offset How many things you have to skip over when moving
from the beginning of a string or array to a specific
position within it. Thus, the minimum offset is zero, not
one, because you dont skip anything to get to the first
item.</p>

<p>one-liner An entire computer program crammed into one
line of text.</p>

<p>open source software Programs for which the source code
is freely available and freely redistributable, with no
commercial strings attached. For a more detailed definition,
see &lt;http://www.opensource.org/osd.html&gt;.</p>

<p>operand An &quot;expression&quot; that yields a
&quot;value&quot; that an &quot;operator&quot; operates on.
See also &quot;precedence&quot;.</p>

<p>operating system A special program that runs on the bare
machine and hides the gory details of managing processes and
devices. Usually used in a looser sense to indicate a
particular culture of programming. The loose sense can be
used at varying levels of specificity. At one extreme, you
might say that all versions of Unix and Unix- lookalikes are
the same operating system (upsetting many people, especially
lawyers and other advocates). At the other extreme, you
could say this particular version of this particular vendors
operating system is different from any other version of this
or any other vendor s operating system. Perl is much more
portable across operating systems than many other languages.
See also &quot;architecture&quot; and
&quot;platform&quot;.</p>

<p>operator A gizmo that transforms some number of input
values to some number of output values, often built into a
language with a special syntax or symbol. A given operator
may have specific expectations about what types of data you
give as its arguments (operands) and what type of data you
want back from it.</p>

<p>operator overloading A kind of &quot;overloading&quot;
that you can do on built-in operators to make them work on
objects as if the objects were ordinary scalar values, but
with the actual semantics supplied by the object class. This
is set up with the overload &quot;pragma&quot;.</p>

<p>options See either switches or &quot;regular expression
modifier&quot;.</p>

<p>overloading Giving additional meanings to a symbol or
construct. Actually, all languages do overloading to one
extent or another, since people are good at figuring out
things from &quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p>overriding Hiding or invalidating some other definition
of the same name. (Not to be confused with
&quot;overloading&quot;, which adds definitions that must be
disambiguated some other way.) To confuse the issue further,
we use the word with two overloaded definitions: to describe
how you can define your own &quot;subroutine&quot; to hide a
built- in &quot;function&quot; of the same name (see
&quot;Overriding Built-in Functions&quot; in perlsub) and to
describe how you can define a replacement &quot;method&quot;
in a &quot;derived class&quot; to hide a &quot;base
class&quot; s method of the same name (see perlobj).</p>

<p>owner The one user (apart from the superuser) who has
absolute control over a &quot;file&quot;. A file may also
have a &quot;group&quot; of users who may exercise joint
ownership if the real owner permits it. See &quot;permission
bits&quot;.</p>

<p>P package A &quot;namespace&quot; for global variables,
subroutines, and the like, such that they can be kept
separate from like-named symbols in other namespaces. In a
sense, only the package is global, since the symbols in the
package s symbol table are only accessible from code
compiled outside the package by naming the package. But in
another sense, all package symbols are also globals--theyre
just well- organized globals.</p>

<p>pad Short for &quot;scratchpad&quot;.</p>

<p>parameter See &quot;argument&quot;.</p>

<p>parent class See &quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p>parse tree See &quot;syntax tree&quot;.</p>

<p>parsing The subtle but sometimes brutal art of
attempting to turn your possibly malformed program into a
valid &quot;syntax tree&quot;.</p>

<p>patch To fix by applying one, as it were. In the realm
of hackerdom, a listing of the differences between two
versions of a program as might be applied by the patch(1)
program when you want to fix a bug or upgrade your old
version.</p>

<p>PATH The list of directories the system searches to find
a program you want to &quot;execute&quot;. The list is
stored as one of your environment variables, accessible in
Perl as $ENV{PATH}.</p>

<p>pathname A fully qualified filename such as
/usr/bin/perl. Sometimes confused with &quot;PATH&quot;.</p>

<p>pattern A template used in &quot;pattern
matching&quot;.</p>

<p>pattern matching Taking a pattern, usually a
&quot;regular expression&quot;, and trying the pattern
various ways on a string to see whether theres any way to
make it fit. Often used to pick interesting tidbits out of a
file.</p>

<p>permission bits Bits that the &quot;owner&quot; of a
file sets or unsets to allow or disallow access to other
people. These flag bits are part of the &quot;mode&quot;
word returned by the stat built-in when you ask about a
file. On Unix systems, you can check the ls(1) manpage for
more information.</p>

<p>Pern What you get when you do &quot;Perl++&quot; twice.
Doing it only once will curl your hair. You have to
increment it eight times to shampoo your hair. Lather,
rinse, iterate.</p>

<p>pipe A direct &quot;connection&quot; that carries the
output of one &quot;process&quot; to the input of another
without an intermediate temporary file. Once the pipe is set
up, the two processes in question can read and write as if
they were talking to a normal file, with some caveats.</p>

<p>pipeline A series of processes all in a row, linked by
pipes, where each passes its output stream to the next.</p>

<p>platform The entire hardware and software context in
which a program runs. A program written in a
platform-dependent language might break if you change any
of: machine, operating system, libraries, compiler, or
system configuration. The perl interpreter has to be
compiled differently for each platform because it is
implemented in C, but programs written in the Perl language
are largely platform- independent.</p>

<p>pod The markup used to embed documentation into your
Perl code. See perlpod.</p>

<p>pointer A &quot;variable&quot; in a language like C that
contains the exact memory location of some other item. Perl
handles pointers internally so you dont have to worry about
them. Instead, you just use symbolic pointers in the form of
keys and &quot;variable&quot; names, or hard references,
which aren t pointers (but act like pointers and do in fact
contain pointers).</p>

<p>polymorphism The notion that you can tell an
&quot;object&quot; to do something generic, and the object
will interpret the command in different ways depending on
its type. [&lt;Gk many shapes]</p>

<p>port The part of the address of a TCP or UDP socket that
directs packets to the correct process after finding the
right machine, something like the phone extension you give
when you reach the company operator. Also, the result of
converting code to run on a different platform than
originally intended, or the verb denoting this
conversion.</p>

<p>portable Once upon a time, C code compilable under both
BSD and SysV. In general, code that can be easily converted
to run on another &quot;platform&quot;, where
&quot;easily&quot; can be defined however you like, and
usually is. Anything may be considered portable if you try
hard enough. See mobile home or London Bridge.</p>

<p>porter Someone who &quot;carries&quot; software from one
&quot;platform&quot; to another. Porting programs written in
platform-dependent languages such as C can be difficult
work, but porting programs like Perl is very much worth the
agony.</p>

<p>POSIX The Portable Operating System Interface
specification.</p>

<p>postfix An &quot;operator&quot; that follows its
&quot;operand&quot;, as in &quot;$x++&quot;.</p>

<p>pp An internal shorthand for a &quot;push-pop&quot;
code, that is, C code implementing Perls stack machine.</p>

<p>pragma A standard module whose practical hints and
suggestions are received (and possibly ignored) at compile
time. Pragmas are named in all lowercase.</p>

<p>precedence The rules of conduct that, in the absence of
other guidance, determine what should happen first. For
example, in the absence of parentheses, you always do
multiplication before addition.</p>

<p>prefix An &quot;operator&quot; that precedes its
&quot;operand&quot;, as in &quot;++$x&quot;.</p>

<p>preprocessing What some helper &quot;process&quot; did
to transform the incoming data into a form more suitable for
the current process. Often done with an incoming
&quot;pipe&quot;. See also &quot;C preprocessor&quot;.</p>

<p>procedure A &quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p>process An instance of a running program. Under
multitasking systems like Unix, two or more separate
processes could be running the same program independently at
the same time--in fact, the fork function is designed to
bring about this happy state of affairs. Under other
operating systems, processes are sometimes called
&quot;threads&quot;, &quot;tasks&quot;, or &quot;jobs&quot;,
often with slight nuances in meaning.</p>

<p>program generator A system that algorithmically writes
code for you in a high-level language. See also &quot;code
generator&quot;.</p>

<p>progressive matching Pattern matching that picks up
where it left off before.</p>

<p>property See either &quot;instance variable&quot; or
&quot;character property&quot;.</p>

<p>protocol In networking, an agreed-upon way of sending
messages back and forth so that neither correspondent will
get too confused.</p>

<p>prototype An optional part of a &quot;subroutine&quot;
declaration telling the Perl compiler how many and what
flavor of arguments may be passed as &quot;actual
arguments&quot;, so that you can write subroutine calls that
parse much like built-in functions. (Or dont parse, as the
case may be.)</p>

<p>pseudofunction A construct that sometimes looks like a
function but really isnt. Usually reserved for
&quot;lvalue&quot; modifiers like my, for
&quot;context&quot; modifiers like scalar, and for the
pick-your-own-quotes constructs, &quot;q//&quot;,
&quot;qq//&quot;, &quot;qx//&quot;, &quot;qw//&quot;,
&quot;qr//&quot;, &quot;m//&quot;, &quot;s///&quot;,
&quot;y///&quot;, and &quot;tr///&quot;.</p>

<p>pseudohash A reference to an array whose initial element
happens to hold a reference to a hash. You can treat a
pseudohash reference as either an array reference or a hash
reference.</p>

<p>pseudoliteral An &quot;operator&quot; that looks
something like a &quot;literal&quot;, such as the
output-grabbing operator,
&quot;&lsquo;&quot;&quot;command&quot;&quot;&lsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p>public domain Something not owned by anybody. Perl is
copyrighted and is thus not in the public domain--its just
&quot;freely available&quot; and &quot;freely
redistributable&quot;.</p>

<p>pumpkin A notional &quot;baton&quot; handed around the
Perl community indicating who is the lead integrator in some
arena of development.</p>

<p>pumpking A &quot;pumpkin&quot; holder, the person in
charge of pumping the pump, or at least priming it. Must be
willing to play the part of the Great Pumpkin now and
then.</p>

<p>PV A &quot;pointer value&quot;, which is Perl Internals
Talk for a &quot;char*&quot;.</p>

<p>Q qualified Possessing a complete name. The symbol
$Ent::moot is qualified; $moot is unqualified. A fully
qualified filename is specified from the top-level
directory.</p>

<p>quantifier A component of a &quot;regular
expression&quot; specifying how many times the foregoing
&quot;atom&quot; may occur.</p>

<p>R readable With respect to files, one that has the
proper permission bit set to let you access the file. With
respect to computer programs, one thats written well enough
that someone has a chance of figuring out what its trying to
do.</p>

<p>reaping The last rites performed by a parent
&quot;process&quot; on behalf of a deceased child process so
that it doesn t remain a &quot;zombie&quot;. See the wait
and waitpid function calls.</p>

<p>record A set of related data values in a
&quot;file&quot; or &quot;stream&quot;, often associated
with a unique &quot;key&quot; field. In Unix, often
commensurate with a &quot;line&quot;, or a
blank-line-terminated set of lines (a
&quot;paragraph&quot;). Each line of the /etc/passwd file is
a record, keyed on login name, containing information about
that user.</p>

<p>recursion The art of defining something (at least
partly) in terms of itself, which is a naughty no-no in
dictionaries but often works out okay in computer programs
if youre careful not to recurse forever, which is like an
infinite loop with more spectacular failure modes.</p>

<p>reference Where you look to find a pointer to
information somewhere else. (See &quot;indirection&quot;.)
References come in two flavors, symbolic references and hard
references.</p>

<p>referent Whatever a reference refers to, which may or
may not have a name. Common types of referents include
scalars, arrays, hashes, and subroutines.</p>

<p>regex See &quot;regular expression&quot;.</p>

<p>regular expression A single entity with various
interpretations, like an elephant. To a computer scientist,
it s a grammar for a little language in which some strings
are legal and others aren t. To normal people, its a pattern
you can use to find what youre looking for when it varies
from case to case. Perls regular expressions are far from
regular in the theoretical sense, but in regular use they
work quite well. Heres a regular expression: &quot;/Oh
s.*t./&quot;. This will match strings like &quot;&quot;Oh
say can you see by the dawn&rsquo;s early light&quot;&quot;
and &quot;&quot;Oh sit!&quot;&quot;. See perlre.</p>

<p>regular expression modifier An option on a pattern or
substitution, such as &quot;/i&quot; to render the pattern
case insensitive. See also &quot;cloister&quot;.</p>

<p>regular file A &quot;file&quot; thats not a
&quot;directory&quot;, a &quot;device&quot;, a named
&quot;pipe&quot; or &quot;socket&quot;, or a &quot;symbolic
link&quot;. Perl uses the &quot;-f&quot; file test operator
to identify regular files. Sometimes called a
&quot;plain&quot; file.</p>

<p>relational operator An &quot;operator&quot; that says
whether a particular ordering relationship is
&quot;true&quot; about a pair of operands. Perl has both
numeric and string relational operators. See &quot;collating
sequence&quot;.</p>

<p>reserved words A word with a specific, built-in meaning
to a &quot;compiler&quot;, such as &quot;if&quot; or delete.
In many languages (not Perl), it s illegal to use reserved
words to name anything else. (Which is why theyre reserved,
after all.) In Perl, you just cant use them to name labels
or filehandles. Also called &quot;keywords&quot;.</p>

<p>return value The &quot;value&quot; produced by a
&quot;subroutine&quot; or &quot;expression&quot; when
evaluated. In Perl, a return value may be either a
&quot;list&quot; or a &quot;scalar&quot;.</p>

<p>RFC Request For Comment, which despite the timid
connotations is the name of a series of important standards
documents.</p>

<p>right shift A &quot;bit shift&quot; that divides a
number by some power of 2.</p>

<p>root The superuser (UID == 0). Also, the top-level
directory of the filesystem.</p>

<p>RTFM What you are told when someone thinks you should
Read The Fine Manual.</p>

<p>run phase Any time after Perl starts running your main
program. See also &quot;compile phase&quot;. Run phase is
mostly spent in &quot;run time&quot; but may also be spent
in &quot;compile time&quot; when require, do
&quot;FILE&quot;, or eval &quot;STRING&quot; operators are
executed or when a substitution uses the &quot;/ee&quot;
modifier.</p>

<p>run time The time when Perl is actually doing what your
code says to do, as opposed to the earlier period of time
when it was trying to figure out whether what you said made
any sense whatsoever, which is &quot;compile time&quot;.</p>

<p>run-time pattern A pattern that contains one or more
variables to be interpolated before parsing the pattern as a
&quot;regular expression&quot;, and that therefore cannot be
analyzed at compile time, but must be re- analyzed each time
the pattern match operator is evaluated. Run- time patterns
are useful but expensive.</p>

<p>RV A recreational vehicle, not to be confused with
vehicular recreation. RV also means an internal Reference
Value of the type a &quot;scalar&quot; can hold. See also
&quot;IV&quot; and &quot;NV&quot; if you re not confused
yet.</p>

<p>rvalue A &quot;value&quot; that you might find on the
right side of an &quot;assignment&quot;. See also
&quot;lvalue&quot;.</p>

<p>S scalar A simple, singular value; a number,
&quot;string&quot;, or &quot;reference&quot;.</p>

<p>scalar context The situation in which an
&quot;expression&quot; is expected by its surroundings (the
code calling it) to return a single &quot;value&quot; rather
than a &quot;list&quot; of values. See also
&quot;context&quot; and &quot;list context&quot;. A scalar
context sometimes imposes additional constraints on the
return value--see &quot;string context&quot; and
&quot;numeric context&quot;. Sometimes we talk about a
&quot;Boolean context&quot; inside conditionals, but this
imposes no additional constraints, since any scalar value,
whether numeric or &quot;string&quot;, is already true or
false.</p>

<p>scalar literal A number or quoted &quot;string&quot;--an
actual &quot;value&quot; in the text of your program, as
opposed to a &quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p>scalar value A value that happens to be a
&quot;scalar&quot; as opposed to a &quot;list&quot;.</p>

<p>scalar variable A &quot;variable&quot; prefixed with
&quot;$&quot; that holds a single value.</p>

<p>scope How far away you can see a variable from, looking
through one. Perl has two visibility mechanisms: it does
&quot;dynamic scoping&quot; of local variables, meaning that
the rest of the &quot;block&quot;, and any subroutines that
are called by the rest of the block, can see the variables
that are local to the block. Perl does &quot;lexical
scoping&quot; of my variables, meaning that the rest of the
block can see the variable, but other subroutines called by
the block cannot see the variable.</p>

<p>scratchpad The area in which a particular invocation of
a particular file or subroutine keeps some of its temporary
values, including any lexically scoped variables.</p>

<p>script A text &quot;file&quot; that is a program
intended to be executed directly rather than compiled to
another form of file before execution. Also, in the context
of &quot;Unicode&quot;, a writing system for a particular
language or group of languages, such as Greek, Bengali, or
Klingon.</p>

<p>script kiddie A &quot;cracker&quot; who is not a
&quot;hacker&quot;, but knows just enough to run canned
scripts. A cargo-cult programmer.</p>

<p>sed A venerable Stream EDitor from which Perl derives
some of its ideas.</p>

<p>semaphore A fancy kind of interlock that prevents
multiple threads or processes from using up the same
resources simultaneously.</p>

<p>separator A &quot;character&quot; or &quot;string&quot;
that keeps two surrounding strings from being confused with
each other. The split function works on separators. Not to
be confused with delimiters or terminators. The
&quot;or&quot; in the previous sentence separated the two
alternatives.</p>

<p>serialization Putting a fancy &quot;data structure&quot;
into linear order so that it can be stored as a
&quot;string&quot; in a disk file or database or sent
through a &quot;pipe&quot;. Also called marshalling.</p>

<p>server In networking, a &quot;process&quot; that either
advertises a &quot;service&quot; or just hangs around at a
known location and waits for clients who need service to get
in touch with it.</p>

<p>service Something you do for someone else to make them
happy, like giving them the time of day (or of their life).
On some machines, well- known services are listed by the
getservent function.</p>

<p>setgid Same as &quot;setuid&quot;, only having to do
with giving away &quot;group&quot; privileges.</p>

<p>setuid Said of a program that runs with the privileges
of its &quot;owner&quot; rather than (as is usually the
case) the privileges of whoever is running it. Also
describes the bit in the mode word (&quot;permission
bits&quot;) that controls the feature. This bit must be
explicitly set by the owner to enable this feature, and the
program must be carefully written not to give away more
privileges than it ought to.</p>

<p>shared memory A piece of &quot;memory&quot; accessible
by two different processes who otherwise would not see each
others memory.</p>

<p>shebang Irish for the whole McGillicuddy. In Perl
culture, a portmanteau of &quot;sharp&quot; and
&quot;bang&quot;, meaning the &quot;#!&quot; sequence that
tells the system where to find the interpreter.</p>

<p>shell A &quot;command&quot;-line
&quot;interpreter&quot;. The program that interactively
gives you a prompt, accepts one or more lines of input, and
executes the programs you mentioned, feeding each of them
their proper arguments and input data. Shells can also
execute scripts containing such commands. Under Unix,
typical shells include the Bourne shell (/bin/sh), the C
shell (/bin/csh), and the Korn shell (/bin/ksh). Perl is not
strictly a shell because it s not interactive (although Perl
programs can be interactive).</p>

<p>side effects Something extra that happens when you
evaluate an &quot;expression&quot;. Nowadays it can refer to
almost anything. For example, evaluating a simple assignment
statement typically has the &quot;side effect&quot; of
assigning a value to a variable. (And you thought assigning
the value was your primary intent in the first place!)
Likewise, assigning a value to the special variable $|
($AUTOFLUSH) has the side effect of forcing a flush after
every write or print on the currently selected
filehandle.</p>

<p>signal A bolt out of the blue; that is, an event
triggered by the &quot;operating system&quot;, probably when
you re least expecting it.</p>

<p>signal handler A &quot;subroutine&quot; that, instead of
being content to be called in the normal fashion, sits
around waiting for a bolt out of the blue before it will
deign to &quot;execute&quot;. Under Perl, bolts out of the
blue are called signals, and you send them with the kill
built-in. See &quot;%SIG&quot; in perlvar and
&quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc.</p>

<p>single inheritance The features you got from your
mother, if she told you that you dont have a father. (See
also &quot;inheritance&quot; and &quot;multiple
inheritance&quot;.) In computer languages, the notion that
classes reproduce asexually so that a given class can only
have one direct ancestor or &quot;base class&quot;. Perl
supplies no such restriction, though you may certainly
program Perl that way if you like.</p>

<p>slice A selection of any number of elements from a
&quot;list&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, or
&quot;hash&quot;.</p>

<p>slurp To read an entire &quot;file&quot; into a
&quot;string&quot; in one operation.</p>

<p>socket An endpoint for network communication among
multiple processes that works much like a telephone or a
post office box. The most important thing about a socket is
its &quot;network address&quot; (like a phone number).
Different kinds of sockets have different kinds of
addresses--some look like filenames, and some dont.</p>

<p>soft reference See &quot;symbolic reference&quot;.</p>

<p>source filter A special kind of &quot;module&quot; that
does &quot;preprocessing&quot; on your script just before it
gets to the &quot;tokener&quot;.</p>

<p>stack A device you can put things on the top of, and
later take them back off in the opposite order in which you
put them on. See &quot;LIFO&quot;.</p>

<p>standard Included in the official Perl distribution, as
in a standard module, a standard tool, or a standard Perl
&quot;manpage&quot;.</p>

<p>standard error The default output &quot;stream&quot; for
nasty remarks that don t belong in &quot;standard
output&quot;. Represented within a Perl program by the
&quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;STDERR&quot;. You can use this
stream explicitly, but the die and warn built-ins write to
your standard error stream automatically.</p>

<p>standard I/O A standard C library for doing buffered
input and output to the &quot;operating system&quot;. (The
&quot;standard&quot; of standard I/O is only marginally
related to the &quot;standard&quot; of standard input and
output.) In general, Perl relies on whatever implementation
of standard I/O a given operating system supplies, so the
buffering characteristics of a Perl program on one machine
may not exactly match those on another machine. Normally
this only influences efficiency, not semantics. If your
standard I/O package is doing block buffering and you want
it to &quot;flush&quot; the buffer more often, just set the
$| variable to a true value.</p>

<p>standard input The default input &quot;stream&quot; for
your program, which if possible shouldn t care where its
data is coming from. Represented within a Perl program by
the &quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;STDIN&quot;.</p>

<p>standard output The default output &quot;stream&quot;
for your program, which if possible shouldnt care where its
data is going. Represented within a Perl program by the
&quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;STDOUT&quot;.</p>

<p>stat structure A special internal spot in which Perl
keeps the information about the last &quot;file&quot; on
which you requested information.</p>

<p>statement A &quot;command&quot; to the computer about
what to do next, like a step in a recipe: &quot;Add
marmalade to batter and mix until mixed.&quot; A statement
is distinguished from a &quot;declaration&quot;, which doesn
t tell the computer to do anything, but just to learn
something.</p>

<p>statement modifier A &quot;conditional&quot; or
&quot;loop&quot; that you put after the
&quot;statement&quot; instead of before, if you know what we
mean.</p>

<p>static Varying slowly compared to something else.
(Unfortunately, everything is relatively stable compared to
something else, except for certain elementary particles, and
were not so sure about them.) In computers, where things are
supposed to vary rapidly, &quot;static&quot; has a
derogatory connotation, indicating a slightly dysfunctional
&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;subroutine&quot;, or
&quot;method&quot;. In Perl culture, the word is politely
avoided.</p>

<p>static method No such thing. See &quot;class
method&quot;.</p>

<p>static scoping No such thing. See &quot;lexical
scoping&quot;.</p>

<p>static variable No such thing. Just use a &quot;lexical
variable&quot; in a scope larger than your
&quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p>status The &quot;value&quot; returned to the parent
&quot;process&quot; when one of its child processes dies.
This value is placed in the special variable $?. Its upper
eight bits are the exit status of the defunct process, and
its lower eight bits identify the signal (if any) that the
process died from. On Unix systems, this status value is the
same as the status word returned by wait(2). See
&quot;system&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p>STDERR See &quot;standard error&quot;.</p>

<p>STDIN See &quot;standard input&quot;.</p>

<p>STDIO See &quot;standard I/O&quot;.</p>

<p>STDOUT See &quot;standard output&quot;.</p>

<p>stream A flow of data into or out of a process as a
steady sequence of bytes or characters, without the
appearance of being broken up into packets. This is a kind
of &quot;interface&quot;--the underlying
&quot;implementation&quot; may well break your data up into
separate packets for delivery, but this is hidden from
you.</p>

<p>string A sequence of characters such as &quot;He said
!@#*&amp;%@#*?!&quot;. A string does not have to be entirely
printable.</p>

<p>string context The situation in which an expression is
expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return
a &quot;string&quot;. See also &quot;context&quot; and
&quot;numeric context&quot;.</p>

<p>stringification The process of producing a
&quot;string&quot; representation of an abstract object.</p>

<p>struct C keyword introducing a structure definition or
name.</p>

<p>structure See &quot;data structure&quot;.</p>

<p>subclass See &quot;derived class&quot;.</p>

<p>subpattern A component of a &quot;regular
expression&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>subroutine A named or otherwise accessible piece of
program that can be invoked from elsewhere in the program in
order to accomplish some sub-goal of the program. A
subroutine is often parameterized to accomplish different
but related things depending on its input arguments. If the
subroutine returns a meaningful &quot;value&quot;, it is
also called a &quot;function&quot;.</p>

<p>subscript A &quot;value&quot; that indicates the
position of a particular &quot;array&quot;
&quot;element&quot; in an array.</p>

<p>substitution Changing parts of a string via the
&quot;s///&quot; operator. (We avoid use of this term to
mean &quot;variable interpolation&quot;.)</p>

<p>substring A portion of a &quot;string&quot;, starting at
a certain &quot;character&quot; position
(&quot;offset&quot;) and proceeding for a certain number of
characters.</p>

<p>superclass See &quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p>superuser The person whom the &quot;operating
system&quot; will let do almost anything. Typically your
system administrator or someone pretending to be your system
administrator. On Unix systems, the &quot;root&quot; user.
On Windows systems, usually the Administrator user.</p>

<p>SV Short for &quot;scalar value&quot;. But within the
Perl interpreter every &quot;referent&quot; is treated as a
member of a class derived from SV, in an object-oriented
sort of way. Every &quot;value&quot; inside Perl is passed
around as a C language &quot;SV*&quot; pointer. The SV
&quot;struct&quot; knows its own &quot;referent type&quot;,
and the code is smart enough (we hope) not to try to call a
&quot;hash&quot; function on a &quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p>switch An option you give on a command line to influence
the way your program works, usually introduced with a minus
sign. The word is also used as a nickname for a &quot;switch
statement&quot;.</p>

<p>switch cluster The combination of multiple command-line
switches (e.g., -a -b -c) into one switch (e.g., -abc). Any
switch with an additional &quot;argument&quot; must be the
last switch in a cluster.</p>

<p>switch statement A program technique that lets you
evaluate an &quot;expression&quot; and then, based on the
value of the expression, do a multiway branch to the
appropriate piece of code for that value. Also called a
&quot;case structure&quot;, named after the similar Pascal
construct. Most switch statements in Perl are spelled
&quot;for&quot;. See &quot;Basic BLOCKs and Switch
Statements&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p>symbol Generally, any &quot;token&quot; or
&quot;metasymbol&quot;. Often used more specifically to mean
the sort of name you might find in a &quot;symbol
table&quot;.</p>

<p>symbol table Where a &quot;compiler&quot; remembers
symbols. A program like Perl must somehow remember all the
names of all the variables, filehandles, and subroutines
youve used. It does this by placing the names in a symbol
table, which is implemented in Perl using a &quot;hash
table&quot;. There is a separate symbol table for each
&quot;package&quot; to give each package its own
&quot;namespace&quot;.</p>

<p>symbolic debugger A program that lets you step through
the execution of your program, stopping or printing things
out here and there to see whether anything has gone wrong,
and if so, what. The &quot;symbolic&quot; part just means
that you can talk to the debugger using the same symbols
with which your program is written.</p>

<p>symbolic link An alternate filename that points to the
real &quot;filename&quot;, which in turn points to the real
&quot;file&quot;. Whenever the &quot;operating system&quot;
is trying to parse a &quot;pathname&quot; containing a
symbolic link, it merely substitutes the new name and
continues parsing.</p>

<p>symbolic reference A variable whose value is the name of
another variable or subroutine. By dereferencing the first
variable, you can get at the second one. Symbolic references
are illegal under use strict refs.</p>

<p>synchronous Programming in which the orderly sequence of
events can be determined; that is, when things happen one
after the other, not at the same time.</p>

<p>syntactic sugar An alternative way of writing something
more easily; a shortcut.</p>

<p>syntax From Greek, &quot;with-arrangement&quot;. How
things (particularly symbols) are put together with each
other.</p>

<p>syntax tree An internal representation of your program
wherein lower-level constructs dangle off the higher-level
constructs enclosing them.</p>

<p>syscall A &quot;function&quot; call directly to the
&quot;operating system&quot;. Many of the important
subroutines and functions you use arent direct system calls,
but are built up in one or more layers above the system call
level. In general, Perl programmers dont need to worry about
the distinction. However, if you do happen to know which
Perl functions are really syscalls, you can predict which of
these will set the $! ($ERRNO) variable on failure.
Unfortunately, beginning programmers often confusingly
employ the term &quot;system call&quot; to mean what happens
when you call the Perl system function, which actually
involves many syscalls. To avoid any confusion, we nearly
always use say &quot;syscall&quot; for something you could
call indirectly via Perl s syscall function, and never for
something you would call with Perls system function.</p>

<p>T tainted Said of data derived from the grubby hands of
a user and thus unsafe for a secure program to rely on. Perl
does taint checks if you run a &quot;setuid&quot; (or
&quot;setgid&quot;) program, or if you use the -T
switch.</p>

<p>TCP Short for Transmission Control Protocol. A protocol
wrapped around the Internet Protocol to make an unreliable
packet transmission mechanism appear to the application
program to be a reliable &quot;stream&quot; of bytes.
(Usually.)</p>

<p>term Short for a &quot;terminal&quot;, that is, a leaf
node of a &quot;syntax tree&quot;. A thing that functions
grammatically as an &quot;operand&quot; for the operators in
an expression.</p>

<p>terminator A &quot;character&quot; or &quot;string&quot;
that marks the end of another string. The $/ variable
contains the string that terminates a readline operation,
which chomp deletes from the end. Not to be confused with
delimiters or separators. The period at the end of this
sentence is a terminator.</p>

<p>ternary An &quot;operator&quot; taking three operands.
Sometimes pronounced &quot;trinary&quot;.</p>

<p>text A &quot;string&quot; or &quot;file&quot; containing
primarily printable characters.</p>

<p>thread Like a forked process, but without
&quot;fork&quot; s inherent memory protection. A thread is
lighter weight than a full process, in that a process could
have multiple threads running around in it, all fighting
over the same process s memory space unless steps are taken
to protect threads from each other. See threads.</p>

<p>tie The bond between a magical variable and its
implementation class. See &quot;tie&quot; in perlfunc and
perltie.</p>

<p>TMTOWTDI Theres More Than One Way To Do It, the Perl
Motto. The notion that there can be more than one valid path
to solving a programming problem in context. (This doesnt
mean that more ways are always better or that all possible
paths are equally desirable--just that there need not be One
True Way.) Pronounced TimToady.</p>

<p>token A morpheme in a programming language, the smallest
unit of text with semantic significance.</p>

<p>tokener A module that breaks a program text into a
sequence of tokens for later analysis by a parser.</p>

<p>tokenizing Splitting up a program text into tokens. Also
known as &quot;lexing&quot;, in which case you get
&quot;lexemes&quot; instead of tokens.</p>

<p>toolbox approach The notion that, with a complete set of
simple tools that work well together, you can build almost
anything you want. Which is fine if youre assembling a
tricycle, but if youre building a defranishizing comboflux
regurgalator, you really want your own machine shop in which
to build special tools. Perl is sort of a machine shop.</p>

<p>transliterate To turn one string representation into
another by mapping each character of the source string to
its corresponding character in the result string. See
&quot;tr/SEARCHLIST/REPLACEMENTLIST/cds&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p>trigger An event that causes a &quot;handler&quot; to be
run.</p>

<p>trinary Not a stellar system with three stars, but an
&quot;operator&quot; taking three operands. Sometimes
pronounced &quot;ternary&quot;.</p>

<p>troff A venerable typesetting language from which Perl
derives the name of its $% variable and which is secretly
used in the production of Camel books.</p>

<p>true Any scalar value that doesnt evaluate to 0 or
&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>truncating Emptying a file of existing contents, either
automatically when opening a file for writing or explicitly
via the truncate function.</p>

<p>type See &quot;data type&quot; and
&quot;class&quot;.</p>

<p>type casting Converting data from one type to another. C
permits this. Perl does not need it. Nor want it.</p>

<p>typed lexical A &quot;lexical variable&quot; that is
declared with a &quot;class&quot; type: &quot;my Pony
$bill&quot;.</p>

<p>typedef A type definition in the C language.</p>

<p>typeglob Use of a single identifier, prefixed with
&quot;*&quot;. For example, *name stands for any or all of
$name, @name, %name, &amp;name, or just &quot;name&quot;.
How you use it determines whether it is interpreted as all
or only one of them. See &quot;Typeglobs and
Filehandles&quot; in perldata.</p>

<p>typemap A description of how C types may be transformed
to and from Perl types within an &quot;extension&quot;
module written in &quot;XS&quot;.</p>

<p>U UDP User Datagram Protocol, the typical way to send
datagrams over the Internet.</p>

<p>UID A user ID. Often used in the context of
&quot;file&quot; or &quot;process&quot; ownership.</p>

<p>umask A mask of those &quot;permission bits&quot; that
should be forced off when creating files or directories, in
order to establish a policy of whom you ll ordinarily deny
access to. See the umask function.</p>

<p>unary operator An operator with only one
&quot;operand&quot;, like &quot;!&quot; or chdir. Unary
operators are usually prefix operators; that is, they
precede their operand. The &quot;++&quot; and &quot;--&quot;
operators can be either prefix or postfix. (Their position
does change their meanings.)</p>

<p>Unicode A character set comprising all the major
character sets of the world, more or less. See
&lt;http://www.unicode.org&gt;.</p>

<p>Unix A very large and constantly evolving language with
several alternative and largely incompatible syntaxes, in
which anyone can define anything any way they choose, and
usually do. Speakers of this language think its easy to
learn because it s so easily twisted to ones own ends, but
dialectical differences make tribal intercommunication
nearly impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a
pidgin-like subset of the language. To be universally
understood, a Unix shell programmer must spend years of
study in the art. Many have abandoned this discipline and
now communicate via an Esperanto-like language called
Perl.</p>

<p>In ancient times, Unix was also used to refer to some
code that a couple of people at Bell Labs wrote to make use
of a PDP-7 computer that wasnt doing much of anything else
at the time.</p>

<p>V value An actual piece of data, in contrast to all the
variables, references, keys, indexes, operators, and whatnot
that you need to access the value.</p>

<p>variable A named storage location that can hold any of
various kinds of &quot;value&quot;, as your program sees
fit.</p>

<p>variable interpolation The &quot;interpolation&quot; of
a scalar or array variable into a string.</p>

<p>variadic Said of a &quot;function&quot; that happily
receives an indeterminate number of &quot;actual
arguments&quot;.</p>

<p>vector Mathematical jargon for a list of scalar
values.</p>

<p>virtual Providing the appearance of something without
the reality, as in: virtual memory is not real memory. (See
also &quot;memory&quot;.) The opposite of
&quot;virtual&quot; is &quot;transparent&quot;, which means
providing the reality of something without the appearance,
as in: Perl handles the variable-length UTF-8 character
encoding transparently.</p>

<p>void context A form of &quot;scalar context&quot; in
which an &quot;expression&quot; is not expected to return
any &quot;value&quot; at all and is evaluated for its
&quot;side effects&quot; alone.</p>

<p>v-string A &quot;version&quot; or &quot;vector&quot;
&quot;string&quot; specified with a &quot;v&quot; followed
by a series of decimal integers in dot notation, for
instance, &quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;. Each number turns into
a &quot;character&quot; with the specified ordinal value.
(The &quot;v&quot; is optional when there are at least three
integers.)</p>

<p>W warning A message printed to the &quot;STDERR&quot;
stream to the effect that something might be wrong but isnt
worth blowing up over. See &quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc and
the warnings pragma.</p>

<p>watch expression An expression which, when its value
changes, causes a breakpoint in the Perl debugger.</p>

<p>whitespace A &quot;character&quot; that moves your
cursor but doesnt otherwise put anything on your screen.
Typically refers to any of: space, tab, line feed, carriage
return, or form feed.</p>

<p>word In normal &quot;computerese&quot;, the piece of
data of the size most efficiently handled by your computer,
typically 32 bits or so, give or take a few powers of 2. In
Perl culture, it more often refers to an alphanumeric
&quot;identifier&quot; (including underscores), or to a
string of nonwhitespace characters bounded by whitespace or
string boundaries.</p>

<p>working directory Your current &quot;directory&quot;,
from which relative pathnames are interpreted by the
&quot;operating system&quot;. The operating system knows
your current directory because you told it with a chdir or
because you started out in the place where your parent
&quot;process&quot; was when you were born.</p>

<p>wrapper A program or subroutine that runs some other
program or subroutine for you, modifying some of its input
or output to better suit your purposes.</p>

<p>WYSIWYG What You See Is What You Get. Usually used when
something that appears on the screen matches how it will
eventually look, like Perls format declarations. Also used
to mean the opposite of magic because everything works
exactly as it appears, as in the three-argument form of
open.</p>

<p>X XS An extraordinarily exported, expeditiously
excellent, expressly eXternal Subroutine, executed in
existing C or C++ or in an exciting new extension language
called (exasperatingly) XS. Examine perlxs for the exact
explanation or perlxstut for an exemplary unexacting
one.</p>

<p>XSUB An external &quot;subroutine&quot; defined in
&quot;XS&quot;.</p>

<p>Y yacc Yet Another Compiler Compiler. A parser generator
without which Perl probably would not have existed. See the
