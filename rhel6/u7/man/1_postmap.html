<p>POSTMAP(1) POSTMAP(1)</p>

<p>NAME postmap - Postfix lookup table management</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postmap [-Nbfhimnoprsvw] [-c config_dir] [-d
key] [-q key] [file_type:]file_name ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The postmap(1) command creates or queries
one or more Postfix lookup tables, or updates an existing
one. The input and output file formats are expected to be
compatible with:</p>

<p>makemap file_type file_name &lt; file_name</p>

<p>If the result files do not exist they will be created
with the same group and other read permissions as their
source file.</p>

<p>While the table update is in progress, signal delivery
is postponed, and an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on
the entire table, in order to avoid surprises in spectator
processes.</p>

<p>INPUT FILE FORMAT The format of a lookup table input
file is as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; A table entry has the form</p>

<p>key whitespace value</p>

<p>&middot; Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are
ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace character
is a #.</p>

<p>&middot; A logical line starts with non-whitespace text.
A line that starts with whitespace continues a logical
line.</p>

<p>The key and value are processed as is, except that
surrounding white space is stripped off. Unlike with Postfix
alias databases, quotes can- not be used to protect lookup
keys that contain special characters such as # or
whitespace.</p>

<p>By default the lookup key is mapped to lowercase to make
the lookups case insensitive; as of Postfix 2.3 this case
folding happens only with tables whose lookup keys are
fixed-case strings such as btree:, dbm: or hash:. With
earlier versions, the lookup key is folded even with tables
where a lookup field can match both upper and lower case
text, such as regexp: and pcre:. This resulted in loss of
information with $number substitutions.</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS -b Enable message body query
mode. When reading lookup keys from standard input with
&quot;-q -&quot;, process the input as if it is an email
message in RFC 2822 format. Each line of body content
becomes one lookup key.</p>

<p>By default, the -b option starts generating lookup keys
at the first non-header line, and stops when the end of the
message is reached. To simulate body_checks(5) processing,
enable MIME parsing with -m. With this, the -b option
generates no body- style lookup keys for attachment MIME
headers and for attached message/* headers.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix version 2.6 and
later.</p>

<p>-c config_dir Read the main.cf configuration file in the
named directory instead of the default configuration
directory.</p>

<p>-d key Search the specified maps for key and remove one
entry per map. The exit status is zero when the requested
information was found.</p>

<p>If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream. The exit status is
zero when at least one of the requested keys was found.</p>

<p>-f Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while
creating or querying a table.</p>

<p>With Postfix version 2.3 and later, this option has no
effect for regular expression tables. There, case folding is
controlled by appending a flag to a pattern.</p>

<p>-h Enable message header query mode. When reading lookup
keys from standard input with &quot;-q -&quot;, process the
input as if it is an email message in RFC 2822 format. Each
logical header line becomes one lookup key. A multi-line
header becomes one lookup key with one or more embedded
newline characters.</p>

<p>By default, the -h option generates lookup keys until
the first non-header line is reached. To simulate
header_checks(5) pro- cessing, enable MIME parsing with -m.
With this, the -h option also generates header-style lookup
keys for attachment MIME headers and for attached message/*
headers.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix version 2.6 and
later.</p>

<p>-i Incremental mode. Read entries from standard input
and do not truncate an existing database. By default,
postmap(1) creates a new database from the entries in
file_name.</p>

<p>-m Enable MIME parsing with &quot;-b&quot; and
&quot;-h&quot;.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix version 2.6 and
later.</p>

<p>-N Include the terminating null character that
terminates lookup keys and values. By default, postmap(1)
does whatever is the default for the host operating
system.</p>

<p>-n Dont include the terminating null character that
terminates lookup keys and values. By default, postmap(1)
does whatever is the default for the host operating
system.</p>

<p>-o Do not release root privileges when processing a
non-root input file. By default, postmap(1) drops root
privileges and runs as the source file owner instead.</p>

<p>-p Do not inherit the file access permissions from the
input file when creating a new file. Instead, create a new
file with default access permissions (mode 0644).</p>

<p>-q key Search the specified maps for key and write the
first value found to the standard output stream. The exit
status is zero when the requested information was found.</p>

<p>If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key
values from the standard input stream and writes one line of
key value output for each key that was found. The exit
status is zero when at least one of the requested keys was
found.</p>

<p>-r When updating a table, do not complain about attempts
to update existing entries, and make those updates
anyway.</p>

<p>-s Retrieve all database elements, and write one line of
key value output for each element. The elements are printed
in database order, which is not necessarily the same as the
original input order.</p>

<p>This feature is available in Postfix version 2.2 and
later, and is not available for all database types.</p>

<p>-v Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
Multiple -v options make the software increasingly
verbose.</p>

<p>-w When updating a table, do not complain about attempts
to update existing entries, and ignore those attempts.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>file_type The database type. To find out what types are
supported, use the &quot;postconf -m&quot; command.</p>

<p>The postmap(1) command can query any supported file
type, but it can create only the following file types:</p>

<p>btree The output file is a btree file, named
file_name.db. This is available on systems with support for
db databases.</p>

<p>cdb The output consists of one file, named
file_name.cdb. This is available on systems with support for
cdb databases.</p>

<p>dbm The output consists of two files, named
file_name.pag and file_name.dir. This is available on
systems with support for dbm databases.</p>

<p>hash The output file is a hashed file, named
file_name.db. This is available on systems with support for
db databases.</p>

<p>sdbm The output consists of two files, named
file_name.pag and file_name.dir. This is available on
systems with support for sdbm databases.</p>

<p>When no file_type is specified, the software uses the
database type specified via the default_database_type
configuration parameter.</p>

<p>file_name The name of the lookup table source file when
rebuilding a database.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems are logged to the standard error
stream and to syslogd(8). No output means that no problems
were detected. Duplicate entries are skipped and are flagged
with a warning.</p>

<p>postmap(1) terminates with zero exit status in case of
success (includ- ing successful &quot;postmap -q&quot;
lookup) and terminates with non-zero exit status in case of
failure.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT MAIL_CONFIG Directory with Postfix
configuration files.</p>

<p>MAIL_VERBOSE Enable verbose logging for debugging
purposes.</p>
