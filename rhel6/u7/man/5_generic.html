<p>GENERIC(5) GENERIC(5)</p>

<p>NAME generic - Postfix generic table format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS postmap /etc/postfix/generic</p>

<p>postmap -q &quot;string&quot; /etc/postfix/generic</p>

<p>postmap -q - /etc/postfix/generic &lt;inputfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The optional generic(5) table specifies an
address mapping that applies when mail is delivered. This is
the opposite of canonical(5) mapping, which applies when
mail is received.</p>

<p>Typically, one would use the generic(5) table on a
system that does not have a valid Internet domain name and
that uses something like localdo- main.local instead. The
generic(5) table is then used by the smtp(8) client to
transform local mail addresses into valid Internet mail
addresses when mail has to be sent across the Internet. See
the EXAM- PLE section at the end of this document.</p>

<p>The generic(5) mapping affects both message header
addresses (i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and
message envelope addresses (for example, the addresses that
are used in SMTP protocol commands).</p>

<p>Normally, the generic(5) table is specified as a text
file that serves as input to the postmap(1) command. The
result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
&quot;postmap /etc/postfix/generic&quot; to rebuild an
indexed file after changing the corresponding text file.</p>

<p>When the table is provided via other means such as NIS,
LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary
indexed files.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the table can be provided as a
regular-expression map where patterns are given as regular
expressions, or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server.
In those case, the lookups are done in a slightly different
way as described below under &quot;REGULAR EXPRESSION
TABLES&quot; or &quot;TCP-BASED TABLES&quot;.</p>

<p>CASE FOLDING The search string is folded to lowercase
before database lookup. As of Postfix 2.3, the search string
is not case folded with database types such as regexp: or
pcre: whose lookup fields can match both upper and lower
case.</p>

<p>TABLE FORMAT The input format for the postmap(1) command
is as follows:</p>

<p>pattern result When pattern matches a mail address,
replace it by the corre- sponding result.</p>

<p>blank lines and comments Empty lines and whitespace-only
lines are ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace
character is a #.</p>

<p>multi-line text A logical line starts with
non-whitespace text. A line that starts with whitespace
continues a logical line.</p>

<p>TABLE SEARCH ORDER With lookups from indexed files such
as DB or DBM, or from networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or
SQL, patterns are tried in the order as listed below:</p>

<p>user@domain address Replace user@domain by address. This
form has the highest prece- dence.</p>

<p>user address Replace user@site by address when site is
equal to $myorigin, when site is listed in $mydestination,
or when it is listed in $inet_interfaces or
$proxy_interfaces.</p>

<p>@domain address Replace other addresses in domain by
address. This form has the lowest precedence.</p>

<p>RESULT ADDRESS REWRITING The lookup result is subject to
address rewriting:</p>

<p>&middot; When the result has the form @otherdomain, the
result becomes the same user in otherdomain.</p>

<p>&middot; When &quot;append_at_myorigin=yes&quot;, append
&quot;@$myorigin&quot; to addresses without
&quot;@domain&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; When &quot;append_dot_mydomain=yes&quot;,
append &quot;.$mydomain&quot; to addresses without
&quot;.domain&quot;.</p>

<p>ADDRESS EXTENSION When a mail address localpart contains
the optional recipient delimiter (e.g., user+foo@domain),
the lookup order becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain,
user+foo, user, and @domain.</p>

<p>The propagate_unmatched_extensions parameter controls
whether an unmatched address extension (+foo) is propagated
to the result of table lookup.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES This section describes how the
table lookups change when the table is given in the form of
regular expressions. For a description of regular expression
lookup table syntax, see regexp_table(5) or
pcre_table(5).</p>

<p>Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to
the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail
addresses are not bro- ken up into their user and @domain
constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and
foo.</p>

<p>Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the
table, until a pattern is found that matches the search
string.</p>

<p>Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
the pattern can be interpo- lated as $1, $2 and so on.</p>

<p>TCP-BASED TABLES This section describes how the table
lookups change when lookups are directed to a TCP-based
server. For a description of the TCP client/server lookup
protocol, see tcp_table(5). This feature is not available up
to and including Postfix version 2.4.</p>

<p>Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.
Thus, user@domain mail addresses are not broken up into
their user and @domain con- stituent parts, nor is user+foo
broken up into user and foo.</p>

<p>Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following shows a generic mapping with an
indexed file. When mail is sent to a remote host via SMTP,
this replaces his@localdomain.local by his ISP mail address,
replaces her@localdomain.local by her ISP mail address, and
replaces other local addresses by his ISP account, with an
address extension of +local (this example assumes that the
ISP supports &quot;+&quot; style address extensions).</p>

<p>/etc/postfix/main.cf: smtp_generic_maps =
hash:/etc/postfix/generic</p>

<p>/etc/postfix/generic: his@localdomain.local
hisaccount@hisisp.example her@localdomain.local
heraccount@herisp.example @localdomain.local
hisaccount+local@hisisp.example</p>

<p>Execute the command &quot;postmap
/etc/postfix/generic&quot; whenever the table is changed.
Instead of hash, some systems use dbm database files. To
find out what tables your system supports use the command
&quot;postconf -m&quot;.</p>

<p>BUGS The table format does not understand quoting
conventions.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS The following main.cf
parameters are especially relevant. The text below provides
only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for more details
including examples.</p>

<p>smtp_generic_maps Address mapping lookup table for
envelope and header sender and recipient addresses while
delivering mail via SMTP.</p>

<p>propagate_unmatched_extensions A list of address
rewriting or forwarding mechanisms that propa- gate an
address extension from the original address to the result.
Specify zero or more of canonical, virtual, alias, for-
ward, include, or generic.</p>

<p>Other parameters of interest:</p>

<p>inet_interfaces The network interface addresses that
this system receives mail on. You need to stop and start
Postfix when this parameter changes.</p>

<p>proxy_interfaces Other interfaces that this machine
receives mail on by way of a proxy agent or network address
translator.</p>

<p>mydestination List of domains that this mail system
considers local.</p>

<p>myorigin The domain that is appended to locally-posted
mail.</p>

<p>owner_request_special Give special treatment to
owner-xxx and xxx-request addresses.</p>
