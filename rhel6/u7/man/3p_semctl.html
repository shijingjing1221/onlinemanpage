<p>SEMCTL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SEMCTL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME semctl - XSI semaphore control operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;</p>

<p>int semctl(int semid, int semnum, int cmd, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The semctl() function operates on XSI
semaphores (see the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 4.15, Semaphore). It is unspecified
whether this function interoperates with the realtime
interprocess communication facilities defined in Realtime
.</p>

<p>The semctl() function provides a variety of semaphore
control opera- tions as specified by cmd. The fourth
argument is optional and depends upon the operation
requested. If required, it is of type union semun, which the
application shall explicitly declare:</p>

<p>union semun { int val; struct semid_ds *buf; unsigned
short *array; } arg;</p>

<p>The following semaphore control operations as specified
by cmd are exe- cuted with respect to the semaphore
specified by semid and semnum. The level of permission
required for each operation is shown with each com- mand;
see XSI Interprocess Communication . The symbolic names for
the values of cmd are defined in the &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;
header:</p>

<p>GETVAL Return the value of semval; see
&lt;sys/sem.h&gt;. Requires read per- mission.</p>

<p>SETVAL Set the value of semval to arg.val, where arg is
the value of the fourth argument to semctl(). When this
command is success- fully executed, the semadj value
corresponding to the specified semaphore in all processes is
cleared. Requires alter permis- sion; see XSI Interprocess
Communication .</p>

<p>GETPID Return the value of sempid. Requires read
permission.</p>

<p>GETNCNT Return the value of semncnt. Requires read
permission.</p>

<p>GETZCNT Return the value of semzcnt. Requires read
permission.</p>

<p>The following values of cmd operate on each semval in
the set of semaphores:</p>

<p>GETALL Return the value of semval for each semaphore in
the semaphore set and place into the array pointed to by
arg.array, where arg is the fourth argument to semctl().
Requires read permission.</p>

<p>SETALL Set the value of semval for each semaphore in the
semaphore set according to the array pointed to by
arg.array, where arg is the fourth argument to semctl().
When this command is successfully executed, the semadj
values corresponding to each specified semaphore in all
processes are cleared. Requires alter permis- sion.</p>

<p>The following values of cmd are also available:</p>

<p>IPC_STAT Place the current value of each member of the
semid_ds data structure associated with semid into the
structure pointed to by arg.buf, where arg is the fourth
argument to semctl(). The con- tents of this structure are
defined in &lt;sys/sem.h&gt;. Requires read permission.</p>

<p>IPC_SET Set the value of the following members of the
semid_ds data structure associated with semid to the
corresponding value found in the structure pointed to by
arg.buf, where arg is the fourth argument to semctl():</p>

<p>sem_perm.uid sem_perm.gid sem_perm.mode</p>

<p>The mode bits specified in IPC General Description are
copied into the corresponding bits of the sem_perm.mode
associated with semid. The stored values of any other bits
are unspecified.</p>

<p>This command can only be executed by a process that has
an effective user ID equal to either that of a process with
appropriate privileges or to the value of sem_perm.cuid or
sem_perm.uid in the semid_ds data structure associated with
semid.</p>

<p>IPC_RMID Remove the semaphore identifier specified by
semid from the sys- tem and destroy the set of semaphores
and semid_ds data struc- ture associated with it. This
command can only be executed by a process that has an
effective user ID equal to either that of a process with
appropriate privileges or to the value of sem_perm.cuid or
sem_perm.uid in the semid_ds data structure associated with
semid.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the value returned by
semctl() depends on cmd as fol- lows:</p>

<p>GETVAL The value of semval.</p>

<p>GETPID The value of sempid.</p>

<p>GETNCNT The value of semncnt.</p>

<p>GETZCNT The value of semzcnt.</p>

<p>All others 0.</p>

<p>Otherwise, semctl() shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The semctl() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Operation permission is denied to the calling
process; see XSI Interprocess Communication .</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of semid is not a valid semaphore
identifier, or the value of semnum is less than 0 or greater
than or equal to sem_nsems, or the value of cmd is not a
valid command.</p>

<p>EPERM The argument cmd is equal to IPC_RMID or IPC_SET
and the effec- tive user ID of the calling process is not
equal to that of a process with appropriate privileges and
it is not equal to the value of sem_perm.cuid or
sem_perm.uid in the data structure associated with
semid.</p>

<p>ERANGE The argument cmd is equal to SETVAL or SETALL and
the value to which semval is to be set is greater than the
system-imposed maximum.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The fourth parameter in the SYNOPSIS
section is now specified as &quot;...&quot; in order to
avoid a clash with the ISO C standard when referring to the
union semun (as defined in Issue 3) and for
backwards-compatibility.</p>

<p>The POSIX Realtime Extension defines alternative
interfaces for inter- process communication. Application
developers who need to use IPC should design their
applications so that modules using the IPC routines
described in XSI Interprocess Communication can be easily
modified to use the alternative interfaces.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
