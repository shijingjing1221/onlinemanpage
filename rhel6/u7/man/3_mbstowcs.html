<p>MBSTOWCS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MBSTOWCS(3)</p>

<p>NAME mbstowcs - convert a multibyte string to a
wide-character string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t mbstowcs(wchar_t *dest, const char *src, size_t
n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If dest is not a NULL pointer, the
mbstowcs() function converts the multibyte string src to a
wide-character string starting at dest. At most n wide
characters are written to dest. The conversion starts in the
initial state. The conversion can stop for three
reasons:</p>

<p>1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.
In this case (size_t) -1 is returned.</p>

<p>2. n non-L&rsquo; &rsquo; wide characters have been
stored at dest. In this case the number of wide characters
written to dest is returned, but the shift state at this
point is lost.</p>

<p>3. The multibyte string has been completely converted,
including the terminating &rsquo; &rsquo;. In this case the
number of wide characters writ- ten to dest, excluding the
terminating L&rsquo; &rsquo; character, is returned.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least n wide char- acters at dest.</p>

<p>If dest is NULL, n is ignored, and the conversion
proceeds as above, except that the converted wide characters
are not written out to mem- ory, and that no length limit
exists.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer
should make sure n is greater or equal to
mbstowcs(NULL,src,0)+1.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The mbstowcs() function returns the number
of wide characters that make up the converted part of the
wide-character string, not including the terminating null
wide character. If an invalid multibyte sequence was
encountered, (size_t) -1 is returned.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of mbstowcs() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>The function mbsrtowcs(3) provides a better interface to
the same func- tionality.</p>
