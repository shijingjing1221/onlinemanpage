<p>NAME ntp_misc - Miscellaneous Options</p>

<p>broadcastdelay seconds The broadcast and multicast modes
require a special calibration to determine the network delay
between the local and remote servers. Ordinarily, this is
done automatically by the initial protocol exchanges between
the client and server. In some cases, the calibration
procedure may fail due to network or server access controls,
for example. This command specifies the default delay to be
used under these circumstances. Typically (for Ethernet), a
number between 0.003 and 0.007 seconds is appropriate.</p>

<p>driftfile driftfile { tolerance ] This command specifies
the complete path and name of the file used to record the
frequency of the local clock oscillator. This is the same
operation as the -f command linke option. If the file
exists, it is read at startup in order to set the ini- tial
frequency and then updated once per hour or more with the
current frequency computed by the daemon. If the file name
is specified, but the file itself does not exist, the starts
with an initial frequency of zero and creates the file when
writing it for the first time. If this command is not given,
the daemon will always start with an initial frequency of
zero. The file format consists of a single line containing a
single floating point number, which records the frequency
offset measured in parts-per-million (PPM). The file is
updated by first writing the current drift value into a
temporary file and then renaming this file to replace the
old version. This implies that ntpd must have write
permission for the directory the drift file is located in,
and that file system links, symbolic or otherwise, should be
avoided. The parameter tolerance is the wander threshold to
skip writing the new value. If the value of wander computed
from recent frequency changes is greater than this threshold
the file will be updated once per hour. If below the
threshold, the file will not be written.</p>

<p>enable [ auth | bclient | calibrate | kernel | monitor |
ntp | pps | stats]</p>

<p>disable [ auth | bclient | calibrate | kernel | monitor
| ntp | pps | stats ] Provides a way to enable or disable
various system options. Flags not mentioned are unaffected.
Note that all of these flags can be controlled remotely
using the ntpdc utility pro- gram.</p>

<p>auth Enables the server to synchronize with unconfigured
peers only if the peer has been correctly authenticated
using either public key or private key cryptography. The
default for this flag is enable.</p>

<p>bclient Enables the server to listen for a message from
a broadcast or multicast server, as in the multicast- client
command with default address. The default for this flag is
disable.</p>

<p>calibrate Enables the calibrate feature for reference
clocks. The default for this flag is disable.</p>

<p>kernel Enables the kernel time discipline, if available.
The default for this flag is enable if support is avail-
able, otherwise disable.</p>

<p>monitor Enables the monitoring facility. See the ntpdc
program and the monlist command or further information. The
default for this flag is enable.</p>

<p>ntp Enables time and frequency discipline. In effect,
this switch opens and closes the feedback loop, which is
useful for testing. The default for this flag is enable.</p>

<p>stats Enables the statistics facility. See the
Monitoring Options page for further information. The default
for this flag is disable.</p>

<p>includefile includefile This command allows additional
configuration commands to be included from a separate file.
Include files may be nested to a depth of five; upon
reaching the end of any include file, com- mand processing
resumes in the previous configuration file. This option is
useful for sites that run ntpd on multiple hosts, with
(mostly) common options (e.g., a restriction list).</p>

<p>interface [listen | ignore | drop] [all | ipv4 | ipv6 |
wildcard | name | address[/prefixlen]] This command controls
which network addresses ntpd opens, and whether input is
dropped without processing. The first parame- ter determines
the action for addresses which match the second parameter.
That parameter specifies a class of addresses, or a specific
interface name, or an address. In the address case,
prefixlen determines how many bits must match for this rule
to apply. ignore prevents opening matching addresses, drop
causes ntpd to open the address and drop all received
packets without examination. Multiple interface commands can
be used. The last rule which matches a particular address
determines the action for it. interface commands are
disabled if any -I, --interface, -L, or --novirtualips
command-line options are used. If none of those options are
used and no interface actions are specified in the
configuration file, all available network addresses are
opened. The nic command is an alias for interface.</p>

<p>leapfile leapfile This command loads the NIST
leapseconds file and initializes the leapsecond values for
the next leapsecond time, expiration time and TAI offset.
The file can be obtained directly from NIST national time
servers using ftp as the ASCII file pub/leap-seconds. While
not strictly a security function, the Autokey protocol
provides means to securely retrieve the cur- rent or updated
leapsecond values from a server.</p>

<p>logconfig configkeyword This command controls the amount
and type of output written to the system syslog facility or
the alternate logfile log file. All configkeyword keywords
can be prefixed with =, + and -, where = sets the
syslogmask, + adds and - removes messages. syslog messages
can be controlled in four classes (clock, peer, sys and
sync). Within these classes four types of messages can be
controlled: informational messages (info), event messages
(events), statistics messages (statistics) and status
messages (status). Configuration keywords are formed by
concatenating the message class with the event class. The
all prefix can be used instead of a message class. A message
class may also be followed by the all keyword to
enable/disable all messages of the respective message class.
By default, logconfig output is set to =syncall +sysevents
+sysstatus. Thus, a minimal log configuration could look
like this: logconfig =syncstatus +sysevents This would just
list the synchronizations state of ntpd and the major system
events. For a simple reference server, the following minimum
message configuration could be useful: logconfig =syncall
+clockall This configuration will list all clock information
and synchronization information. All other events and
messages about peers, system events and so on is
suppressed.</p>

<p>logfile logfile This command specifies the location of
an alternate log file to be used instead of the default
system syslog facility. This is the same operation as the -l
command line option.</p>

<p>phone dial1 dial2 ... This command is used in
conjunction with the ACTS modem driver (type 18). The
arguments consist of a maximum of 10 telephone numbers used
to dial USNO, NIST or European time services. The Hayes
command ATDT is normally prepended to the number, which can
contain other modem control codes as well.</p>

<p>saveconfigdir directory_path Specify the directory in
which to write configuration snapshots requested with ntpq s
saveconfig command. If saveconfigdir does not appear in the
configuration file, saveconfig requests are rejected by
ntpd.</p>

<p>setvar variable [default] This command adds an
additional system variable. These vari- ables can be used to
distribute additional information such as the access policy.
If the variable of the form name = value is followed by the
default keyword, the variable will be listed as part of the
default system variables (ntpq rv command). These additional
variables serve informational purposes only. They are not
related to the protocol other that they can be listed. The
known protocol variables will always override any variables
defined via the setvar mechanism. There are three special
vari- ables that contain the names of all variable of the
same group. The sys_var_list holds the names of all system
variables. The peer_var_list holds the names of all peer
variables and the clock_var_list holds the names of the
reference clock vari- ables.</p>

<p>tinker [ allan allan | dispersion dispersion | freq freq
| huffpuff huffpuff | panic panic | step step | stepout
stepout ] This command alters certain system variables used
by the clock discipline algorithm. The default values of
these variables have been carefully optimized for a wide
range of network speeds and reliability expectations. Very
rarely is it neces- sary to change the default values; but,
some folks cant resist twisting the knobs. The options are
as follows:</p>

<p>allan allan Spedifies the Allan intercept, which is a
parameter of the PLL/FLL clock discipline algorithm, in
seconds with default 1500 s.</p>

<p>dispersion dispersion Specifies the dispersion increase
rate in parts-per- million (PPM) with default 15 PPM.</p>

<p>freq freq Spedifies the frequency offset in
parts-per-million (PPM) with default the value in the
frequency file.</p>

<p>huffpuff huffpuff Spedifies the huff-n-puff filter span,
which deter- mines the most recent interval the algorithm
will search for a minimum delay. The lower limit is 900 s
(15 m), but a more reasonable value is 7200 (2 hours).</p>

<p>panic panic Spedifies the panic threshold in seconds
with default 1000 s. If set to zero, the panic sanity check
is dis- abled and a clock offset of any value will be
accepted.</p>

<p>step step Spedifies the step threshold in seconds. The
default without this command is 0.128 s. If set to zero,
step adjustments will never occur. Note: The kernel time
discipline is disabled if the step threshold is set to zero
or greater than 0.5 s and the threshold is applied also to
leap second corrections.</p>

<p>stepout stepout Specifies the stepout threshold in
seconds. The default without this command is 900 s. If set
to zero, popcorn spikes will not be suppressed.</p>

<p>tos [ beacon beacon | ceiling ceiling | cohort {0 | 1} |
floor floor | maxclock maxclock | maxdist maxdist | minclock
minclock | mindist mindist | minsane minsane | orphan
stratum ] This command alters certain system variables used
by the the clock selection and clustering algorithms. The
default values of these variables have been carefully
optimized for a wide range of network speeds and reliability
expectations. Very rarely is it necessary to change the
default values; but, some folks cant resist twisting the
knobs. It can be used to select the quality and quantity of
peers used to synchronize the sys- tem clock and is most
useful in dynamic server discovery schemes. The options are
as follows:</p>

<p>beacon beacon The manycast server sends packets at
intervals of 64 s if less than maxclock servers are
available. Otherwise, it sends packets at the beacon
interval in seconds. The default is 3600 s. See the
Automatic Server Discovery page for further details.</p>

<p>ceiling ceiling Specify the maximum stratum (exclusive)
for acceptable server packets. The default is 16. See the
Automatic Server Discovery page for further details.</p>

<p>cohort { 0 | 1 } Specify whether (1) or whether not (0)
a server packet will be accepted for the same stratum as the
client. The default is 0. See the Automatic Server Discovery
page for further details.</p>

<p>floor floor Specify the minimum stratum (inclusive) for
acceptable server packest. The default is 1. See the
Automatic Server Discovery page for further details.</p>

<p>maxclock maxclock Specify the maximum number of servers
retained by the server discovery schemes. The default is 10.
See the Automatic Server Discovery page for further
details.</p>

<p>maxdist maxdistance Specify the synchronization distance
threshold used by the clock selection algorithm. The default
is 1.5 s. This determines both the minimum number of packets
to set the system clock and the maximum roundtrip delay. It
can be decreased to improve reliability or increased to
synchronize clocks on the Moon or planets.</p>

<p>minclock minclock Specify the number of servers used by
the clustering algorithm as the minimum to include on the
candidate list. The default is 3. This is also the number of
servers to be averaged by the combining algorithm.</p>

<p>mindist mindistance Specify the minimum distance used by
the selection and anticlockhop algorithm. Larger values
increase the tol- erance for outliers; smaller values
increase the selec- tivity. The default is .001 s. In some
cases, such as reference clocks with high jitter and a PPS
signal, it is useful to increase the value to insure the
intersec- tion interval is always nonempty.</p>

<p>minsane minsane Specify the number of servers used by
the selection algorithm as the minimum to set the system
clock. The default is 1 for legacy purposes; however, for
critical applications the value should be somewhat higher
but less than minclock.</p>

<p>orphan stratum Specify the orphan stratum with default
16. If less than 16 this is the stratum assumed by the root
servers. See the Association Management page for fur- ther
details.</p>

<p>trap host_address [port port_number] [interface
interfSace_address] This command configures a trap receiver
at the given host address and port number for sending
messages with the specified local interface address. If the
port number is unspecified, a value of 18447 is used. If the
interface address is not speci- fied, the message is sent
with a source address of the local interface the message is
sent through. Note that on a multi- homed host the interface
used may vary from time to time with routing changes. The
trap receiver will generally log event messages and other
information from the server in a log file. While such
monitor programs may also request their own trap
dynamically, configuring a trap receiver will ensure that no
messages are lost when the server is started.</p>

<p>ttl hop ... This command specifies a list of TTL values
in increasing order. up to 8 values can be specified. In
manycast mode these values are used in turn in an
expanding-ring search. The default is eight multiples of 32
starting at 31.</p>
