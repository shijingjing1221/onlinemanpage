<p>Tk_CreateEventHandler(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_CreateEventHandler(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CreateEventHandler, Tk_DeleteEventHandler -
associate procedure callback with an X event</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_CreateEventHandler(tkwin, mask, proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteEventHandler(tkwin, mask, proc, clientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Window tkwin (in) Token for window in which
events may occur.</p>

<p>unsigned long mask (in) Bit-mask of events (such as But-
tonPressMask) for which proc should be called.</p>

<p>Tk_EventProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke whenever an
event in mask occurs in the win- dow given by tkwin.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_CreateEventHandler arranges for proc to
be invoked in the future whenever one of the event types
specified by mask occurs in the window specified by tkwin.
The callback to proc will be made by Tk_Han- dleEvent; this
mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events
through Tk_HandleEvent (or through other Tk procedures that
call Tk_HandleEvent, such as Tk_DoOneEvent or
Tk_MainLoop).</p>

<p>Proc should have arguments and result that match the
type Tk_EventProc: typedef void Tk_EventProc( ClientData
clientData, XEvent *eventPtr); The clientData parameter to
proc is a copy of the clientData argument given to
Tk_CreateEventHandler when the callback was created. Typi-
cally, clientData points to a data structure containing
application- specific information about the window in which
the event occurred. EventPtr is a pointer to the X event,
which will be one of the ones specified in the mask argument
to Tk_CreateEventHandler.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteEventHandler may be called to delete a
previously-created event handler: it deletes the first
handler it finds that is associ- ated with tkwin and matches
the mask, proc, and clientData arguments. If no such handler
exists, then Tk_HandleEvent returns without doing anything.
Although Tk supports it, its probably a bad idea to have
more than one callback with the same mask, proc, and
clientData argu- ments. When a window is deleted all of its
handlers will be deleted automatically; in this case there
is no need to call Tk_DeleteEven- tHandler.</p>

<p>If multiple handlers are declared for the same type of X
event on the same window, then the handlers will be invoked
in the order they were created.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS bind, callback, event, handler</p>
