<p>char * Tcl_DStringAppend(dsPtr, bytes, length)</p>

<p>char * Tcl_DStringAppendElement(dsPtr, element)</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringStartSublist(dsPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringEndSublist(dsPtr)</p>

<p>int Tcl_DStringLength(dsPtr)</p>

<p>char * Tcl_DStringValue(dsPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringSetLength(dsPtr, newLength)</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringResult(interp, dsPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringGetResult(interp, dsPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_DString *dsPtr (in/out) Pointer to
structure that is used to manage a dynamic string.</p>

<p>const char *bytes (in) Pointer to characters to append
to dynamic string.</p>

<p>const char *element (in) Pointer to characters to append
as list element to dynamic string.</p>

<p>int length (in) Number of bytes from bytes to add to
dynamic string. If -1, add all characters up to null
terminating character.</p>

<p>int newLength (in) New length for dynamic string, not
including null terminating charac- ter.</p>

<p>Tcl_Interp *interp (in/out) Interpreter whose result is
to be set from or moved to the dynamic string.

<p>DESCRIPTION Dynamic strings provide a mechanism for
building up arbitrarily long strings by gradually appending
information. If the dynamic string is short then there will
be no memory allocation overhead; as the string gets larger,
additional space will be allocated as needed.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringInit initializes a dynamic string to zero
length. The Tcl_DString structure must have been allocated
by the caller. No assumptions are made about the current
state of the structure; anything already in it is discarded.
If the structure has been used previously, Tcl_DStringFree
should be called first to free up any memory allocated for
the old string.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringAppend adds new information to a dynamic
string, allocating more memory for the string if needed. If
length is less than zero then everything in bytes is
appended to the dynamic string; otherwise length specifies
the number of bytes to append. Tcl_DStringAppend returns a
pointer to the characters of the new string. The string can
also be retrieved from the string field of the Tcl_DString
structure.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringAppendElement is similar to Tcl_DStringAppend
except that it does not take a length argument (it appends
all of element) and it con- verts the string to a proper
list element before appending. Tcl_DStringAppendElement adds
a separator space before the new list element unless the new
list element is the first in a list or sub-list (i.e. either
the current string is empty, or it contains the single
character {, or the last two characters of the current
string are { ). Tcl_DStringAppendElement returns a pointer
to the characters of the new string.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringStartSublist and Tcl_DStringEndSublist can be
used to create nested lists. To append a list element that
is itself a sublist, first call Tcl_DStringStartSublist,
then call Tcl_DStringAppendElement for each of the elements
in the sublist, then call Tcl_DStringEndSublist to end the
sublist. Tcl_DStringStartSublist appends a space character
if needed, followed by an open brace; Tcl_DStringEndSublist
appends a close brace. Lists can be nested to any depth.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringLength is a macro that returns the current
length of a dynamic string (not including the terminating
null character). Tcl_DStringValue is a macro that returns a
pointer to the current con- tents of a dynamic string.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringSetLength changes the length of a dynamic
string. If newLength is less than the strings current
length, then the string is truncated. If newLength is
greater than the strings current length, then the string
will become longer and new space will be allocated for the
string if needed. However, Tcl_DStringSetLength will not
initial- ize the new space except to provide a terminating
null character; it is up to the caller to fill in the new
space. Tcl_DStringSetLength does not free up the strings
storage space even if the string is trun- cated to zero
length, so Tcl_DStringFree will still need to be called.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringTrunc changes the length of a dynamic string.
This proce- dure is now deprecated. Tcl_DStringSetLength
should be used instead.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringFree should be called when you are finished
using the string. It frees up any memory that was allocated
for the string and reinitializes the strings value to an
empty string.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringResult sets the result of interp to the value
of the dynamic string given by dsPtr. It does this by moving
a pointer from dsPtr to the interpreter s result. This saves
the cost of allocating new memory and copying the string.
Tcl_DStringResult also reinitializes the dynamic string to
an empty string.</p>

<p>Tcl_DStringGetResult does the opposite of
Tcl_DStringResult. It sets the value of dsPtr to the result
of interp and it clears interps result. If possible it does
this by moving a pointer rather than by copying the
string.</p>
