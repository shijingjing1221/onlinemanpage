<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKSIZE(3Linux Programmer s
ManuPTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKSIZE(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_setstacksize,
pthread_attr_getstacksize - set/get stack size attribute in
thread attributes object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_setstacksize(pthread_attr_t *attr,
size_t stacksize); int
pthread_attr_getstacksize(pthread_attr_t *attr, size_t
*stacksize);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_setstacksize() function
sets the stack size attribute of the thread attributes
object referred to by attr to the value speci- fied in
stacksize.</p>

<p>The stack size attribute determines the minimum size (in
bytes) that will be allocated for threads created using the
thread attributes object attr.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_getstacksize() function returns the
stack size attribute of the thread attributes object
referred to by attr in the buffer pointed to by
stacksize.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return 0; on
error, they return a non-zero error number.</p>

<p>ERRORS pthread_attr_setstacksize() can fail with the
following error:</p>

<p>EINVAL The stack size is less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
(16384) bytes.</p>

<p>On some systems, pthread_attr_setstacksize() can fail
with the error EINVAL if stacksize is not a multiple of the
system page size.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These functions are provided by glibc since
version 2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE See pthread_create(3).</p>

<p>NOTES For details on the default stack size of new
threads, see pthread_cre- ate(3).</p>

<p>A thread s stack size is fixed at the time of thread
creation. Only the main thread can dynamically grow its
stack.</p>

<p>The pthread_attr_setstack(3) function allows an
application to set both the size and location of a
caller-allocated stack that is to be used by a thread.</p>

<p>BUGS As at glibc 2.8, if the specified stacksize is not
a multiple of STACK_ALIGN (16 bytes on most architectures),
it may be rounded down- wards, in violation of POSIX.1-2001,
which says that the allocated stack will be at least
stacksize bytes.</p>
