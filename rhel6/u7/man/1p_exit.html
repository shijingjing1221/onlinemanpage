<p>EXIT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual EXIT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME exit - cause the shell to exit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS exit [n]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The exit utility shall cause the shell to
exit with the exit status specified by the unsigned decimal
integer n. If n is specified, but its value is not between 0
and 255 inclusively, the exit status is undefined.</p>

<p>A trap on EXIT shall be executed before the shell
terminates, except when the exit utility is invoked in that
trap itself, in which case the shell shall exit
immediately.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status shall be n, if specified.
Otherwise, the value shall be the exit value of the last
command executed, or zero if no command was executed. When
exit is executed in a trap action, the last command is
considered to be the command that executed immediately
preceding the trap action.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Exit with a true value:</p>

<p>exit 0</p>

<p>Exit with a false value:</p>

<p>exit 1</p>

<p>RATIONALE As explained in other sections, certain exit
status values have been reserved for special uses and should
be used by applications only for those purposes:</p>

<p>126 A file to be executed was found, but it was not an
executable utility.</p>

<p>127 A utility to be executed was not found.</p>

<p>&gt;128 A command was interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
