<p>NAME ppmtoyuvsplit - convert a PPM image to 3 subsampled
raw YUV files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoyuvsplit basename [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtoyuvsplit reads a PPM image as input. Produces 3 raw
files base- name.Y, basename.U and basename.V as output.</p>

<p>The output files are the subsampled raw YUV
representation of the input PPM image, as required by the
Stanford MPEG codec. The Y output file contains a byte for
each pixel in the image, with the rows going from top to
bottom and the columns within each row going left to right.
The U and V output files are arranged similarly, except that
each byte rep- resents a square of 4 pixels of the image.
The value is the arithmetic mean of the value for each of
those 4 pixels. Hence, the Y file is 4 times the size of the
U file or V file.</p>

<p>The YUV values are scaled according to CCIR.601, as
assumed by MPEG.</p>
