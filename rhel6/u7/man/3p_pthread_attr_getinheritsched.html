<p>PTHREAD_ATTR_GETINHERITSCHEPOSIX Programmer s
PTHREAD_ATTR_GETINHERITSCHED(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_attr_getinheritsched,
pthread_attr_setinheritsched - get and set the inheritsched
attribute (REALTIME THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_attr_getinheritsched(const pthread_attr_t
*restrict attr, int *restrict inheritsched); int
pthread_attr_setinheritsched(pthread_attr_t *attr, int
inheritsched);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_attr_getinheritsched(), and
pthread_attr_setinheritsched() functions, respectively,
shall get and set the inheritsched attribute in the attr
argument.</p>

<p>When the attributes objects are used by
pthread_create(), the inher- itsched attribute determines
how the other scheduling attributes of the created thread
shall be set.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED</p>

<p>Specifies that the thread scheduling attributes shall be
inher- ited from the creating thread, and the scheduling
attributes in this attr argument shall be ignored.</p>

<p>PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED</p>

<p>Specifies that the thread scheduling attributes shall be
set to the corresponding values from this attributes
object.</p>

<p>The symbols PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED and
PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED are defined in the &lt;pthread.h&gt;
header.</p>

<p>The following thread scheduling attributes defined by
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 are affected by the inheritsched
attribute: scheduling policy ( schedpolicy), scheduling
parameters ( schedparam), and scheduling contention scope (
contentionscope).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the
pthread_attr_getinheritsched() and pthread_attr_set-
inheritsched() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function may
fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of inheritsched is not valid.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP An attempt was made to set the attribute to an
unsupported value.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE After these attributes have been set,
a thread can be created with the specified attributes using
pthread_create(). Using these routines does not affect the
current running thread.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
