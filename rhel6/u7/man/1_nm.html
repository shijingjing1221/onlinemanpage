<p>DESCRIPTION GNU nm lists the symbols from object files
objfile.... If no object files are listed as arguments, nm
assumes the file a.out.</p>

<p>For each symbol, nm shows:</p>

<p>&middot; The symbol value, in the radix selected by
options (see below), or hexadecimal by default.</p>

<p>&middot; The symbol type. At least the following types
are used; others are, as well, depending on the object file
format. If lowercase, the symbol is local; if uppercase, the
symbol is global (external).</p>

<p>&quot;A&quot; The symbol s value is absolute, and will
not be changed by further linking.</p>

<p>&quot;B&quot; &quot;b&quot; The symbol is in the
uninitialized data section (known as BSS).</p>

<p>&quot;C&quot; The symbol is common. Common symbols are
uninitialized data. When linking, multiple common symbols
may appear with the same name. If the symbol is defined
anywhere, the common symbols are treated as undefined
references.</p>

<p>&quot;D&quot; &quot;d&quot; The symbol is in the
initialized data section.</p>

<p>&quot;G&quot; &quot;g&quot; The symbol is in an
initialized data section for small objects. Some object file
formats permit more efficient access to small data objects,
such as a global int variable as opposed to a large global
array.</p>

<p>&quot;i&quot; For PE format files this indicates that
the symbol is in a section specific to the implementation of
DLLs. For ELF format files this indicates that the symbol is
an indirect function. This is a GNU extension to the
standard set of ELF symbol types. It indicates a symbol
which if referenced by a relocation does not evaluate to its
address, but instead must be invoked at runtime. The runtime
execution will then return the value to be used in the
relocation.</p>

<p>&quot;N&quot; The symbol is a debugging symbol.</p>

<p>&quot;p&quot; The symbols is in a stack unwind
section.</p>

<p>&quot;R&quot; &quot;r&quot; The symbol is in a read only
data section.</p>

<p>&quot;S&quot; &quot;s&quot; The symbol is in an
uninitialized data section for small objects.</p>

<p>&quot;T&quot; &quot;t&quot; The symbol is in the text
(code) section.</p>

<p>&quot;U&quot; The symbol is undefined.</p>

<p>&quot;u&quot; The symbol is a unique global symbol. This
is a GNU extension to the standard set of ELF symbol
bindings. For such a symbol the dynamic linker will make
sure that in the entire process there is just one symbol
with this name and type in use.</p>

<p>&quot;V&quot; &quot;v&quot; The symbol is a weak object.
When a weak defined symbol is linked with a normal defined
symbol, the normal defined symbol is used with no error.
When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not
defined, the value of the weak symbol becomes zero with no
error. On some systems, uppercase indicates that a default
value has been specified.</p>

<p>&quot;W&quot; &quot;w&quot; The symbol is a weak symbol
that has not been specifically tagged as a weak object
symbol. When a weak defined symbol is linked with a normal
defined symbol, the normal defined symbol is used with no
error. When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol
is not defined, the value of the symbol is determined in a
system-specific manner without error. On some systems,
uppercase indicates that a default value has been
specified.</p>

<p>&quot;-&quot; The symbol is a stabs symbol in an a.out
object file. In this case, the next values printed are the
stabs other field, the stabs desc field, and the stab type.
Stabs symbols are used to hold debugging information.</p>

<p>&quot;?&quot; The symbol type is unknown, or object file
format specific.</p>

<p>&middot; The symbol name.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The long and short forms of options, shown here
as alternatives, are equivalent.</p>

<p>-A -o --print-file-name Precede each symbol by the name
of the input file (or archive member) in which it was found,
rather than identifying the input file once only, before all
of its symbols.</p>

<p>-a --debug-syms Display all symbols, even debugger-only
symbols; normally these are not listed.</p>

<p>-B The same as --format=bsd (for compatibility with the
MIPS nm).</p>

<p>-C --demangle[=style] Decode (demangle) low-level symbol
names into user-level names. Besides removing any initial
underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function
names readable. Different compilers have different mangling
styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
compiler.</p>

<p>--no-demangle Do not demangle low-level symbol names.
This is the default.</p>

<p>-D --dynamic Display the dynamic symbols rather than the
normal symbols. This is only meaningful for dynamic objects,
such as certain types of shared libraries.</p>

<p>-f format --format=format Use the output format format,
which can be &quot;bsd&quot;, &quot;sysv&quot;, or
&quot;posix&quot;. The default is &quot;bsd&quot;. Only the
first character of format is significant; it can be either
upper or lower case.</p>

<p>-g --extern-only Display only external symbols.</p>

<p>--plugin name Load the plugin called name to add support
for extra target types. This option is only available if the
toolchain has been built with plugin support enabled.</p>

<p>-l --line-numbers For each symbol, use debugging
information to try to find a filename and line number. For a
defined symbol, look for the line number of the address of
the symbol. For an undefined symbol, look for the line
number of a relocation entry which refers to the symbol. If
line number information can be found, print it after the
other symbol information.</p>

<p>-n -v --numeric-sort Sort symbols numerically by their
addresses, rather than alphabetically by their names.</p>

<p>-p --no-sort Do not bother to sort the symbols in any
order; print them in the order encountered.</p>

<p>-P --portability Use the POSIX.2 standard output format
instead of the default format. Equivalent to -f posix.</p>

<p>-S --print-size Print both value and size of defined
symbols for the &quot;bsd&quot; output style. This option
has no effect for object formats that do not record symbol
sizes, unless --size-sort is also used in which case a
calculated size is displayed.</p>

<p>-s --print-armap When listing symbols from archive
members, include the index: a mapping (stored in the archive
by ar or ranlib) of which modules contain definitions for
which names.</p>

<p>-r --reverse-sort Reverse the order of the sort (whether
numeric or alphabetic); let the last come first.</p>

<p>--size-sort Sort symbols by size. The size is computed
as the difference between the value of the symbol and the
value of the symbol with the next higher value. If the
&quot;bsd&quot; output format is used the size of the symbol
is printed, rather than the value, and -S must be used in
order both size and value to be printed.</p>

<p>--special-syms Display symbols which have a
target-specific special meaning. These symbols are usually
used by the target for some special processing and are not
normally helpful when included included in the normal symbol
lists. For example for ARM targets this option would skip
the mapping symbols used to mark transitions between ARM
code, THUMB code and data.</p>

<p>-t radix --radix=radix Use radix as the radix for
printing the symbol values. It must be d for decimal, o for
octal, or x for hexadecimal.</p>

<p>--target=bfdname Specify an object code format other
than your system s default format.</p>

<p>-u --undefined-only Display only undefined symbols
(those external to each object file).</p>

<p>--defined-only Display only defined symbols for each
object file.</p>

<p>-V --version Show the version number of nm and exit.</p>

<p>-X This option is ignored for compatibility with the AIX
version of nm. It takes one parameter which must be the
string 32_64. The default mode of AIX nm corresponds to -X
32, which is not supported by GNU nm.</p>

<p>--help Show a summary of the options to nm and exit.</p>

<p>@file Read command-line options from file. The options
read are inserted in place of the original @file option. If
file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will
be treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p>Options in file are separated by whitespace. A
whitespace character may be included in an option by
surrounding the entire option in either single or double
quotes. Any character (including a backslash) may be
included by prefixing the character to be included with a
backslash. The file may itself contain additional @file
options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>
