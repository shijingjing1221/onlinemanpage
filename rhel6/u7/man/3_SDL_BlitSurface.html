<p>SDL_BlitSurface(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_BlitSurface(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_BlitSurface - This performs a fast blit from
the source surface to the destination surface.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>int SDL_BlitSurface(SDL_Surface *src, SDL_Rect *srcrect,
SDL_Surface *dst, SDL_Rect *dstrect);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This performs a fast blit from the source
surface to the destination surface.</p>

<p>Only the position is used in the dstrect (the width and
height are ignored).</p>

<p>If either srcrect or dstrect are NULL, the entire
surface (src or dst) is copied.</p>

<p>The final blit rectangle is saved in dstrect after all
clipping is per- formed (srcrect is not modified).</p>

<p>The blit function should not be called on a locked
surface.</p>

<p>The results of blitting operations vary greatly
depending on whether SDL_SRCAPLHA is set or not. See
SDL_SetAlpha for an explaination of how this affects your
results. Colorkeying and alpha attributes also inter- act
with surface blitting, as the following pseudo-code should
hope- fully explain.</p>

<p>if (source surface has SDL_SRCALPHA set) { if (source
surface has alpha channel (that is, format-&gt;Amask != 0))
blit using per-pixel alpha, ignoring any colour key else {
if (source surface has SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set) blit using the
colour key AND the per-surface alpha value else blit using
the per-surface alpha value } } else { if (source surface
has SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set) blit using the colour key else
ordinary opaque rectangular blit }</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the blit is successful, it returns 0,
otherwise it returns -1.</p>

<p>If either of the surfaces were in video memory, and the
blit returns -2, the video memory was lost, so it should be
reloaded with artwork and re-blitted:</p>

<p>while ( SDL_BlitSurface(image, imgrect, screen, dstrect)
== -2 ) { while ( SDL_LockSurface(image)) &lt; 0 )
Sleep(10); -- Write image pixels to image-&gt;pixels --
SDL_UnlockSurface(image); }</p>

<p>This happens under DirectX 5.0 when the system switches
away from your fullscreen application. Locking the surface
will also fail until you have access to the video memory
again.</p>
