<p>NAME smbd - server to provide SMB/CIFS services to
clients</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smbd [-D] [-F] [-S] [-i] [-h] [-V] [-b] [-d
&lt;debug level&gt;] [-l &lt;log directory&gt;] [-p &lt;port
number(s)&gt;] [-P &lt;profiling level&gt;] [-O &lt;socket
option&gt;] [-s &lt;configuration file&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>smbd is the server daemon that provides filesharing and
printing services to Windows clients. The server provides
filespace and printer services to clients using the SMB (or
CIFS) protocol. This is compatible with the LanManager
protocol, and can service LanManager clients. These include
MSCLIENT 3.0 for DOS, Windows for Workgroups, Windows
95/98/ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, OS/2, DAVE for
Macintosh, and smbfs for Linux.</p>

<p>An extensive description of the services that the server
can provide is given in the man page for the configuration
file controlling the attributes of those services (see
smb.conf(5). This man page will not describe the services,
but will concentrate on the administrative aspects of
running the server.</p>

<p>Please note that there are significant security
implications to running this server, and the smb.conf(5)
manual page should be regarded as mandatory reading before
proceeding with installation.</p>

<p>A session is created whenever a client requests one.
Each client gets a copy of the server for each session. This
copy then services all connections made by the client during
that session. When all connections from its client are
closed, the copy of the server for that client
terminates.</p>

<p>The configuration file, and any files that it includes,
are automatically reloaded every minute, if they change. You
can force a reload by sending a SIGHUP to the server.
Reloading the configuration file will not affect connections
to any service that is already established. Either the user
will have to disconnect from the service, or smbd killed and
restarted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D If specified, this parameter causes the
server to operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches itself
and runs in the background, fielding requests on the
appropriate port. Operating the server as a daemon is the
recommended way of running smbd for servers that provide
more than casual use file and print services. This switch is
assumed if smbd is executed on the command line of a
shell.</p>

<p>-F If specified, this parameter causes the main smbd
process to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate
with the terminal. Child processes are still created as
normal to service each connection request, but the main
process does not exit. This operation mode is suitable for
running smbd under process supervisors such as supervise and
svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein&rsquo;s daemontools package,
or the AIX process monitor.</p>

<p>-S If specified, this parameter causes smbd to log to
standard output rather than a file.</p>

<p>-i If this parameter is specified it causes the server
to run &quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if
the server is executed on the command line of a shell.
Setting this parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when
run from the command line. smbd also logs to standard
output, as if the -S parameter had been given.</p>

<p>-d|--debuglevel=level level is an integer from 0 to 10.
The default value if this parameter is not specified is
0.</p>

<p>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to
the log files about the activities of the server. At level
0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.
Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it
generates a small amount of information about operations
carried out.</p>

<p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p>Note that specifying this parameter here will override
the log level parameter in the smb.conf file.</p>

<p>-V|--version Prints the program version number.</p>

<p>-s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt; The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>-l|--log-basename=logdirectory Base directory name for
log/debug files. The extension &quot;.progname&quot; will be
appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
file is never removed by the client.</p>

<p>-h|--help Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>-b Prints information about how Samba was built.</p>

<p>-p|--port&lt;port number(s)&gt; port number(s) is a
space or comma-separated list of TCP ports smbd should
listen on. The default value is taken from the ports
parameter in smb.conf</p>

<p>The default ports are 139 (used for SMB over NetBIOS
over TCP) and port 445 (used for plain SMB over TCP).</p>

<p>-P|--profiling-level&lt;profiling level&gt; profiling
level is a number specifying the level of profiling data to
be collected. 0 turns off profiling, 1 turns on counter
profiling only, 2 turns on complete profiling, and 3 resets
all profiling data.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/inetd.conf If the server is to be run by the
inetd meta-daemon, this file must contain suitable startup
information for the meta-daemon.</p>

<p>/etc/rc or whatever initialization script your system
uses).</p>

<p>If running the server as a daemon at startup, this file
will need to contain an appropriate startup sequence for the
server.</p>

<p>/etc/services If running the server via the meta-daemon
inetd, this file must contain a mapping of service name
(e.g., netbios-ssn) to service port (e.g., 139) and protocol
type (e.g., tcp).</p>

<p>/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf This is the default
location of the smb.conf(5) server configuration file. Other
common places that systems install this file are
/usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and /etc/samba/smb.conf.</p>

<p>This file describes all the services the server is to
make available to clients. See smb.conf(5) for more
information.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS On some systems smbd cannot change uid back
to root after a setuid() call. Such systems are called
trapdoor uid systems. If you have such a system, you will be
unable to connect from a client (such as a PC) as two
different users at once. Attempts to connect the second user
will result in access denied or similar.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PRINTER If no printer name is
specified to printable services, most systems will use the
value of this variable (or lp if this variable is not
defined) as the name of the printer to use. This is not
specific to the server, however.</p>

<p>PAM INTERACTION Samba uses PAM for authentication (when
presented with a plaintext password), for account checking
(is this account disabled?) and for session management. The
degree too which samba supports PAM is restricted by the
limitations of the SMB protocol and the obey pam
restrictions smb.conf(5) parameter. When this is set, the
following restrictions apply:</p>

<p>&middot; Account Validation: All accesses to a samba
server are checked against PAM to see if the account is
valid, not disabled and is permitted to login at this time.
This also applies to encrypted logins.</p>

<p>&middot; Session Management: When not using share level
security, users must pass PAM&rsquo;s session checks before
access is granted. Note however, that this is bypassed in
share level security. Note also that some older pam
configuration files may need a line added for session
support.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of the
Samba suite.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Most diagnostics issued by the server are
logged in a specified log file. The log file name is
specified at compile time, but may be overridden on the
command line.</p>

<p>The number and nature of diagnostics available depends
on the debug level used by the server. If you have problems,
set the debug level to 3 and peruse the log files.</p>

<p>Most messages are reasonably self-explanatory.
Unfortunately, at the time this man page was created, there
are too many diagnostics available in the source code to
warrant describing each and every diagnostic. At this stage
your best bet is still to grep the source code and inspect
the conditions that gave rise to the diagnostics you are
seeing.</p>

<p>TDB FILES Samba stores it&rsquo;s data in several TDB
(Trivial Database) files, usually located in
/var/lib/samba.</p>

necessarily important to backup).</p>

<p>SIGNALS Sending the smbd a SIGHUP will cause it to
reload its smb.conf configuration file within a short period
of time.</p>

<p>To shut down a user&rsquo;s smbd process it is
recommended that SIGKILL (-9) NOT be used, except as a last
resort, as this may leave the shared memory area in an
inconsistent state. The safe way to terminate an smbd is to
send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for it to die on its
own.</p>

<p>The debug log level of smbd may be raised or lowered
using smbcontrol(1) program (SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no
longer used since Samba 2.2). This is to allow transient
problems to be diagnosed, whilst still running at a normally
low log level.</p>

<p>Note that as the signal handlers send a debug write,
they are not re-entrant in smbd. This you should wait until
smbd is in a state of waiting for an incoming SMB before
issuing them. It is possible to make the signal handlers
safe by un-blocking the signals before the select call and
re-blocking them after, however this would affect
performance.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
