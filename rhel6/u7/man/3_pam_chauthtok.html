<p>PAM_CHAUTHTOK(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_CHAUTHTOK(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_chauthtok - updating authentication tokens</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_chauthtok(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_chauthtok function is used to change
the authentication token for a given user (as indicated by
the state associated with the handle pamh).</p>

<p>The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained
by a prior call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the
binary or of zero or more of the following values:</p>

<p>PAM_SILENT Do not emit any messages.</p>

<p>PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK This argument indicates to
the modules that the users authentication token (password)
should only be changed if it has expired. If this argument
is not passed, the application requires that all
authentication tokens are to be changed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR A module was unable to
obtain the new authentication token.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR A module was unable to obtain
the old authentication token.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY One or more of the modules was
unable to change the authentication token since it is
currently locked.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING Authentication token aging has
been disabled for at least one of the modules.</p>

<p>PAM_PERM_DENIED Permission denied.</p>

<p>PAM_SUCCESS The authentication token was successfully
updated.</p>

<p>PAM_TRY_AGAIN Not all of the modules were in a position
to update the authentication token(s). In such a case none
of the user&acute;s authentication tokens are updated.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User unknown to password service.</p>
