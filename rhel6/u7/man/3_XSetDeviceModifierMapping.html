<p>XGETDEVICEMODIFIERMA(3) XGETDEVICEMODIFIERMA(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGetDeviceModifierMapping,
XSetDeviceModifierMapping - query or change device modifier
mappings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>int XSetDeviceModifierMapping( Display *display, XDevice
*device, XModifierKeymap *modmap);</p>

<p>XModifierKeymap *XGetDeviceModifierMapping( Display
*display, XDevice *device);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device whose modifier mapping is to
be queried or modified.</p>

<p>modmap Specifies a pointer to the XModifierKeymap
structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetDeviceModifierMapping request
specifies the KeyCodes of the keys (if any) that are to be
used as modifiers for the specified device. If it succeeds,
the X server generates a DeviceMappingNotify event, and
XSetDeviceModifierMapping returns MappingSuccess. X permits
at most eight modifier keys. If more than eight are
specified in the XModifierKeymap structure, a BadLength
error results.</p>

<p>The modifiermap member of the XModifierKeymap structure
contains eight sets of max_keypermod KeyCodes, one for each
modifier in the order Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2,
Mod3, Mod4, and Mod5. Only nonzero KeyCodes have meaning in
each set, and zero KeyCodes are ignored. In addition, all of
the nonzero KeyCodes must be in the range specified by
min_keycode and max_keycode as returned by
XListInputDevices, or a BadValue error results. No KeyCode
may appear twice in the entire map, or a BadValue error
results.</p>

<p>An X server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can
be changed, for example, if certain keys do not generate up
transitions in hardware, if auto-repeat cannot be disabled
on certain keys, or if multiple modifier keys are not
supported. If some such restriction is violated, the status
reply is MappingFailed, and none of the modifiers are
changed. If the new KeyCodes specified for a modifier differ
from those currently defined and any (current or new) keys
for that modifier are in the logically down state,
XSetDeviceModifierMapping returns MappingBusy, and none of
the modifiers is changed.</p>

<p>XSetDeviceModifierMapping can generate BadLength,
BadDevice, BadMatch, BadAlloc, and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XGetDeviceModifierMapping request returns a pointer
to a newly created XModifierKeymap structure that contains
the keys being used as modifiers. The structure should be
freed after use by calling XFreeModifierMapping . If only
zero values appear in the set for any modifier, that
modifier is disabled.</p>

<p>XGetDeviceModifierMapping can generate BadDevice and
BadMatch errors.</p>

<p>Structures</p>

<p>The XModifierKeymap structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int max_keypermod; KeyCode
*modifiermap; } XModifierKeymap;</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadLength More than eight keys were
specified in the XModifierKeymap structure.</p>

<p>BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the requested
resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadDevice An invalid device was specified. The specified
device does not exist or has not been opened by this client
via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the
specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.</p>

<p>BadMatch This error may occur if an
XGetDeviceModifierMapping or XChangeDeviceModifierMapping
request was made specifying a device that has no keys.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
