<p>NAME faillock - Tool for displaying and modifying the
authentication failure record files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS faillock [--dir /path/to/tally-directory]
[--user username] [--reset]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_faillock.so module maintains a list
of failed authentication attempts per user during a
specified interval and locks the account in case there were
more than deny consecutive failed authentications. It stores
the failure records into per-user files in the tally
directory.</p>

<p>The faillock command is an application which can be used
to examine and modify the contents of the the tally files.
It can display the recent failed authentication attempts of
the username or clear the tally files of all or individual
usernames.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --dir /path/to/tally-directory The directory
where the user files with the failure records are kept. The
default is /var/run/faillock.</p>

<p>--user username The user whose failure records should be
displayed or cleared.</p>

<p>--reset Instead of displaying the user&acute;s failure
records, clear them.</p>

<p>FILES /var/run/faillock/* the files logging the
authentication failures for users</p>
