<p>NAME rpmgraph - Display RPM Package Dependency Graph</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpmgraph PACKAGE_FILE ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmgraph uses PACKAGE_FILE arguments to
generate a package dependency graph. Each PACKAGE_FILE
argument is read and added to an rpm transac- tion set. The
elements of the transaction set are partially ordered using
a topological sort. The partially ordered elements are then
printed to standard output.</p>

<p>Nodes in the dependency graph are package names, and
edges in the directed graph point to the parent of each
node. The parent node is defined as the last predecessor of
a package when partially ordered using the package
dependencies as a relation. That means that the par- ent of
a given package is the packages last prerequisite.</p>

<p>The output is in dot(1) directed graph format, and can
be displayed or printed using the dotty graph editor from
the graphviz package. There are no rpmgraph specific
options, only common rpm options. See the rpmgraph usage
message for what is currently implemented.</p>
