<p>NAME glutMenuStatusFunc - Modern variant of
glutMenuStateFunc()</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - menucallback</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutMenuStatusFunc(void( *callback )( int status,
int x, int y ));</p>

<p>PARAMETERS callback Client menu status hook.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Broadly, OpenGLUT operates in two modes. At
any given time, it is either in menu mode (with a popup menu
display, possibly with subitems) or it is not.</p>

<p>When moving from non-menu to menu status, callback (if
defined) will be called with GLUT_MENU_IN_USE . Conversely,
when moving from menu to non-menu status, callback (if
defined) will be called with GLUT_MENU_NOT_IN_USE .</p>

<p>This differs from glutMenuStateFunc() in that callback
is also given the x and y coordinates of the mouse when the
menu state transition took place.</p>

<p>This callback is bound to both the current window and
the current menu .</p>

<p>BUGS Your callback is not actually called presently.</p>
