<p>IPSEC_TNCFG(5) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_TNCFG(5)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_tncfg - lists IPSEC virtual interfaces
attached to real interfaces</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec tncfg cat/proc/net/ipsec_tncfg</p>

<p>OBSOLETE Note that tncfg is only supported on the
classic KLIPS stack. It is not supported on any other stack
and will be completely removed in future versions. A
replacement command still needs to be designed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /proc/net/ipsec_tncfg is a read-only file
which lists which IPSEC virtual interfaces are attached to
which real interfaces, through which packets will be
forwarded once processed by IPSEC.</p>

<p>Each line lists one ipsec I/F. A table entry consists
of:</p>

<p>+ an ipsec virtual I/F name</p>

<p>+ a visual and machine parsable separator
&acute;-&gt;&acute;, separating the virtual I/F and the
physical I/F,</p>

<p>+ a physical I/F name, to which the ipsec virtual I/F is
attached or NULL if it is not attached,</p>

<p>+ the keyword mtu=,</p>

<p>+ the MTU of the ipsec virtual I/F,</p>

<p>+ the automatically adjusted effective MTU for PMTU
discovery, in brackets,</p>

<p>+ a visual and machine parsable separator
&acute;-&gt;&acute;, separating the virtual I/F MTU and the
physical I/F MTU,</p>

<p>+ the MTU of the attached physical I/F.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ipsec2 -&gt; eth3 mtu=16260(1443) -&gt;
1500</p>

<p>shows that virtual device ipsec2 with an MTU of 16260 is
connected to physical device eth3 with an MTU of 1500 and
that the effective MTU as a result of PMTU discovery has
been automatically set to 1443.</p>

<p>ipsec0 -&gt; wvlan0 mtu=1400(16260) -&gt; 1500</p>

<p>shows that virtual device ipsec0 with an MTU of 1400 is
connected to physical device wvlan0 with an MTU of 1500 and
no PMTU packets have gotten far enough to bump down the
effective MTU from its default of 16260.</p>

<p>ipsec3 -&gt; NULL mtu=0(0) -&gt; 0</p>

<p>shows that virtual device ipsec3 is not connected to any
physical device.</p>
