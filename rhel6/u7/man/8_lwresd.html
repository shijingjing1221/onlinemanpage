<p>LWRESD(8) BIND9 LWRESD(8)</p>

<p>NAME lwresd - lightweight resolver daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lwresd [-c config-file] [-C config-file] [-d
debug-level] [-f] [-g] [-i pid-file] [-m flag] [-n #cpus]
[-P port] [-p port] [-s] [-t directory] [-u user] [-v] [-4]
[-6]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lwresd is the daemon providing name lookup
services to clients that use the BIND 9 lightweight resolver
library. It is essentially a stripped-down, caching-only
name server that answers queries using the BIND 9
lightweight resolver protocol rather than the DNS
protocol.</p>

<p>lwresd listens for resolver queries on a UDP port on the
IPv4 loopback interface, 127.0.0.1. This means that lwresd
can only be used by processes running on the local machine.
By default, UDP port number 921 is used for lightweight
resolver requests and responses.</p>

<p>Incoming lightweight resolver requests are decoded by
the server which then resolves them using the DNS protocol.
When the DNS lookup completes, lwresd encodes the answers in
the lightweight resolver format and returns them to the
client that made the request.</p>

<p>If /etc/resolv.conf contains any nameserver entries,
lwresd sends recursive DNS queries to those servers. This is
similar to the use of forwarders in a caching name server.
If no nameserver entries are present, or if forwarding
fails, lwresd resolves the queries autonomously starting at
the root name servers, using a built-in list of root server
hints.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -4 Use IPv4 only even if the host machine is
capable of IPv6. -4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-6 Use IPv6 only even if the host machine is capable of
IPv4. -4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>-c config-file Use config-file as the configuration file
instead of the default, /etc/lwresd.conf. -c can not be used
with -C.</p>

<p>-C config-file Use config-file as the configuration file
instead of the default, /etc/resolv.conf. -C can not be used
with -c.</p>

<p>-d debug-level Set the daemons debug level to
debug-level. Debugging traces from lwresd become more
verbose as the debug level increases.</p>

<p>-f Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not
daemonize).</p>

<p>-g Run the server in the foreground and force all
logging to stderr.</p>

<p>-i pid-file Use pid-file as the PID file instead of the
default, /var/run/lwresd/lwresd.pid.</p>

<p>-m flag Turn on memory usage debugging flags. Possible
flags are usage, trace, record, size, and mctx. These
correspond to the ISC_MEM_DEBUGXXXX flags described in
&lt;isc/mem.h&gt;.</p>

<p>-n #cpus Create #cpus worker threads to take advantage
of multiple CPUs. If not specified, lwresd will try to
determine the number of CPUs present and create one thread
per CPU. If it is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a
single worker thread will be created.</p>

<p>-P port Listen for lightweight resolver queries on port
port. If not specified, the default is port 921.</p>

<p>-p port Send DNS lookups to port port. If not specified,
the default is port 53. This provides a way of testing the
lightweight resolver daemon with a name server that listens
for queries on a non-standard port number.</p>

<p>-s Write memory usage statistics to stdout on exit.
Note: This option is mainly of interest to BIND 9 developers
and may be removed or changed in a future release.</p>

<p>-t directory Chroot to directory after processing the
command line arguments, but before reading the configuration
file. Warning: This option should be used in conjunction
with the -u option, as chrooting a process running as root
doesnt enhance security on most systems; the way chroot(2)
is defined allows a process with root privileges to escape a
chroot jail.</p>

<p>-u user Setuid to user after completing privileged
operations, such as creating sockets that listen on
privileged ports.</p>

<p>-v Report the version number and exit.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/resolv.conf The default configuration
file.</p>

<p>/var/run/lwresd.pid The default process-id file.</p>
