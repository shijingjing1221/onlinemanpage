<p>XInitThreads(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XInitThreads(3)</p>

<p>NAME XInitThreads, XLockDisplay, XUnlockDisplay -
multi-threading support</p>

<p>SYNTAX Status XInitThreads(void);</p>

<p>void XLockDisplay(Display *display);</p>

<p>void XUnlockDisplay(Display *display);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XInitThreads function initializes Xlib
support for concurrent threads. This function must be the
first Xlib function a multi- threaded program calls, and it
must complete before any other Xlib call is made. This
function returns a nonzero status if initialization was
successful; otherwise, it returns zero. On systems that do
not support threads, this function always returns zero.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to call this function if multiple
threads might use Xlib concurrently. If all calls to Xlib
functions are protected by some other access mechanism (for
example, a mutual exclusion lock in a toolkit or through
explicit client programming), Xlib thread initial- ization
is not required. It is recommended that single-threaded pro-
grams not call this function.</p>

<p>The XLockDisplay function locks out all other threads
from using the specified display. Other threads attempting
to use the display will block until the display is unlocked
by this thread. Nested calls to XLockDisplay work correctly;
the display will not actually be unlocked until
XUnlockDisplay has been called the same number of times as
XLock- Display. This function has no effect unless Xlib was
successfully ini- tialized for threads using
XInitThreads.</p>

<p>The XUnlockDisplay function allows other threads to use
the specified display again. Any threads that have blocked
on the display are allowed to continue. Nested locking works
correctly; if XLockDisplay has been called multiple times by
a thread, then XUnlockDisplay must be called an equal number
of times before the display is actually unlocked. This
function has no effect unless Xlib was successfully
initialized for threads using XInitThreads.</p>
