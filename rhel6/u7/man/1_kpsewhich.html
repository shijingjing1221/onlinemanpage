<p>NAME kpsewhich - standalone path lookup and and
expansion for kpathsea</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kpsewhich [options] [filenames]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Kpathsea: A
library for path searching.</p>

<p>kpsewhich is used as a standalone front-end of the
kpathsea library that can be used to examine variables and
find files. When the -format option is not given, the search
path used when looking for a file is inferred from the name
given, by looking for a known extension. If no known
extension is found, the search path for TeX source files is
used.</p>
