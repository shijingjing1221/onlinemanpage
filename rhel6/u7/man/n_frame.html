<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME frame - Create and manipulate frame widgets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS frame pathName ?options?</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -borderwidth -highlightcolor -pady
-cursor -highlightthickness -relief -highlightbackground
-padx -takefocus</p>

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-background
Database Name: background Database Class: Background</p>

<p>This option is the same as the standard background
option except that its value may also be specified as an
empty string. In this case, the widget will display no
background or border, and no colors will be consumed from
its colormap for its background and border.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-class Database Name: class Database
Class: Class</p>

<p>Specifies a class for the window. This class will be
used when querying the option database for the windows other
options, and it will also be used later for other purposes
such as bindings. The class option may not be changed with
the configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-colormap Database Name: colormap
Database Class: Colormap</p>

<p>Specifies a colormap to use for the window. The value
may be either new, in which case a new colormap is created
for the win- dow and its children, or the name of another
window (which must be on the same screen and have the same
visual as pathName), in which case the new window will use
the colormap from the speci- fied window. If the colormap
option is not specified, the new window uses the same
colormap as its parent. This option may not be changed with
the configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-container Database Name: container
Database Class: Container</p>

<p>The value must be a boolean. If true, it means that this
window will be used as a container in which some other
application will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can
be embedded using the -use option). The window will support
the appropriate win- dow manager protocols for things like
geometry requests. The window should not have any children
of its own in this applica- tion. This option may not be
changed with the configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-height Database Name: height Database
Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies the desired height for the window in any of
the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is less
than or equal to zero then the window will not request any
size at all. Note that this sets the total height of the
frame, any -border- width or similar is not added. Normally
-height should not be used if a propagating geometry
manager, such as grid or pack, is used within the frame
since the geometry manager will override the height of the
frame.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-visual Database Name: visual Database
Class: Visual</p>

<p>Specifies visual information for the new window in any
of the forms accepted by Tk_GetVisual. If this option is not
speci- fied, the new window will use the same visual as its
parent. The visual option may not be modified with the
configure widget command.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the
forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is less
than or equal to zero then the window will not request any
size at all. Note that this sets the total width of the
frame, any -border- width or similar is not added. Normally
-width should not be used if a propagating geometry manager,
such as grid or pack, is used within the frame since the
geometry manager will override the width of the frame.

<p>DESCRIPTION The frame command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a frame
widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
con- figure aspects of the frame such as its background
color and relief. The frame command returns the path name of
the new window.</p>

<p>A frame is a simple widget. Its primary purpose is to
act as a spacer or container for complex window layouts. The
only features of a frame are its background color and an
optional 3-D border to make the frame appear raised or
sunken.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The frame command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is the same as the path name of the
frames window. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general form:
pathName option ?arg arg ...? PathName is the name of the
command, which is the same as the frame widgets path name.
Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the
command. The following commands are possible for frame
widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the frame command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
infor- mation on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the frame command.</p>

<p>BINDINGS When a new frame is created, it has no default
event bindings: frames are not intended to be
interactive.</p>
