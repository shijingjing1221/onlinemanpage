<p>FEBOOTSTRAP(8) Virtualization Support FEBOOTSTRAP(8)</p>

<p>NAME febootstrap - Bootstrap a basic Fedora system (like
Debian debootstrap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS febootstrap [--options] REPO TARGET
[MIRROR]</p>

<p>EXAMPLES febootstrap fedora-10 /tmp/f10 febootstrap
rawhide /tmp/rawhide febootstrap rawhide /tmp/rawhide
http://mymirror/rawhide/x86_64/os febootstrap
--groupinstall=&quot;Mail Server&quot; fedora-10
/tmp/mailserver</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION febootstrap creates a Fedora root
filesystem, based on the Fedora version specified by REPO
under the directory specified by TARGET. Optionally MIRROR
can point to a local mirror (otherwise the public Fedora
mirrors are used). REPO names are &quot;fedora-VERSION&quot;
(eg. &quot;fedora-10&quot;) or &quot;rawhide&quot;.</p>

<p>febootstrap does not need to be run as root. If for some
reason you do run it as root, then it works slightly
differently and may have side effects such as stopping or
starting system daemons.</p>

<p>For more advanced needs, take a look at mock(1),
&quot;livecd-creator&quot; and thincrust.nets
&quot;appliance-creator&quot;.</p>

<p>The normal output is a root directory located at TARGET
and a fakeroot logfile at
&quot;TARGET/fakeroot.log&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i package --install=package -g
&quot;group&quot; --groupinstall=&quot;group&quot; Specify
the package or group to install. To list multiple packages
or groups, you must give multiple &quot;-i&quot; or
&quot;-g&quot; options. Group names can contain spaces, so
use quotes where necessary.</p>

<p>These are passed directly to &quot;yum install&quot; or
&quot;yum groupinstall&quot; commands, and thus any
dependencies are also resolved by yum. You can also use
shell globs and filenames here, as with ordinary yum.</p>

<p>If no packages or groups are given, then we install the
&quot;Core&quot; group which is a small working Fedora
installation (but by no means minimal). Use &quot;yum
groupinfo Core&quot; to list the packages currently in the
&quot;Core&quot; group.</p>

<p>--no-clean Normally febootstrap will clean up the yum
repository (&quot;/var/cache/yum&quot; inside the image).
This contains the downloaded RPMs and metadata. However if
you give the &quot;--no-clean&quot; option, then the yum
repository is left. This is useful if you want to run
further yum commands inside the filesystem by hand.</p>

<p>-p &quot;proxyurl&quot; --proxy=&quot;proxyurl&quot; URL
to the proxy server that yum should use.</p>

<p>-u source --updates=source Pull in updates from an
additional updates repository. The possible sources are:</p>

<p>-u &quot;http://...&quot; (a URL) Get updates from the
specific URL.</p>

<p>-u &quot;updates-released-fN&quot; (an updates
repository name) Get updates from the public mirrors of the
named repository (eg. &quot;updates-released-f10&quot;). See
REPOSITORIES below.</p>

<p>-u &quot;none&quot; (default) Dont add an updates
repository. This is the default.</p>

<p>REPOSITORIES You can list available repositories by
visiting this URL:</p>


<p>&lt;http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=help&amp;arch=i386&gt;</p>

<p>(If necessary replace &quot;i386&quot; with your
architecture, but it seems unlikely that this list will
change based on architecture).</p>

<p>RUNNING EXTRA COMMANDS IN THE ROOT FILESYSTEM If you
want to run further commands inside the root filesystem, for
example additional &quot;yum&quot; installs, then use
&quot;febootstrap-run&quot;. See the febootstrap-run(8)
manual page for more details.</p>

<p>You have to be careful about modifying files in the root
filesystem directly (without using
&quot;febootstrap-run&quot;). Its easy to confuse fakeroot
and end up with the wrong permissions on files (see FAKEROOT
LOGFILE below).</p>

<p>&quot;febootstrap-run&quot; runs the command inside the
root filesystem, which means it wont normally have access to
files outside the root. You can use
&quot;FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH&quot; environment variable
(see fakechroot(1)) or copy files into the root first.</p>

<p>FAKEROOT LOGFILE When febootstrap is run as non-root
(the normal case) we use fakeroot so that yum thinks it is
running as root. Fakeroot keeps track of &quot;real&quot;
file permissions in a log file which is saved into the
target directory as &quot;TARGET/fakeroot.log&quot;.</p>

<p>This logfile is indexed by inode number, which makes
certain operations safe and other operations unsafe. Files
should be replaced only by doing:</p>

<p>echo updated-content &gt; old-file</p>

<p>(since that preserves the original inode).</p>

<p>Deleting files and then creating new ones (even with a
different name) is usually unsafe, because the new files
might reuse inodes claimed by the old files, and so appear
with peculiar permissions (eg. unreadable, or as a symbolic
link).</p>

<p>Deleting files is also usually unsafe, although the
reasons are more subtle. If you just use &quot;rm&quot; then
the inode number is not deleted from
&quot;fakeroot.log&quot; which means it can be reused by
another file later on.</p>

<p>In most cases its usually safest to use
&quot;febootstrap-run&quot;.</p>

<p>You can use the fakeroot logfile in a number of
ways:</p>

<p>&middot; Use febootstrap-run(8) to run a command with
the faked file permissions.</p>

<p>&middot; Use febootstrap-install(8) to install a file
with permissions in the root filesystem.</p>

<p>&middot; Generate an initramfs (compressed cpio) file
containing the correct permissions using the tool
&quot;febootstrap-to-initramfs&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Generate a supermin appliance using the tool
&quot;febootstrap-to-supermin&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; Apply the permissions to the target directory
using the forthcoming tool &quot;febootstrap-fix-root&quot;
(requires root).</p>

<p>RUNNING FEBOOTSTRAP AS ROOT There is some rudimentary
support for running &quot;febootstrap&quot; as root. However
it is not well-tested and generally not recommended.</p>

<p>COMPARISON TO DEBOOTSTRAP febootstrap cannot do
cross-architecture installs (&quot;debootstrap
--foreign&quot;). The reason is that %pre and %post scripts
cannot run. It may be possible to defer running of
scriptlets (which is basically how debootstrap works), and
patches to do this are welcomed.</p>

<p>febootstrap cannot do 32-on-64 bit installs. The reason
is that fakeroot and fakechroot do not load the correct
preload library. This is really a bug in
fakeroot/fakechroot, which we think would be easy to fix.
(debootstrap deals with this case the same as for
&quot;--foreign&quot; installs - see previous point).</p>

<p>OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND BUGS The following programs are
not run during %post scriptlets (because they are all
statically linked, and fakechroot cannot run statically
linked programs).</p>

<p>&quot;/sbin/ldconfig&quot; (from many packages)
&quot;/usr/sbin/glibc_post_upgrade&quot; (from
&quot;glibc&quot;)
&quot;/usr/sbin/build-locale-archive&quot; (from
&quot;glibc-common&quot;)
&quot;/usr/sbin/libgcc_post_upgrade&quot; (from
&quot;libgcc&quot;)</p>

<p>If you wish, you can run them the first time you boot
into the new machine.</p>

<p>febootstrap recreates the repository anew each time, and
this causes yum to download all the RPMs every time. This is
very wasteful, and we should provide a way to cache the
repository.</p>
