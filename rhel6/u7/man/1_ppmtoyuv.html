<p>NAME ppmtoyuv - convert a PPM image to an Abekas YUV
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoyuv [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmtoyuv reads a PPM image as input and produces an
Abekas YUV file as output.</p>

<p>The output file contains a raster of four byte YUV
codes, each uniquely associated with two side-by-side pixels
in the image. The raster con- tains rows in order from top
to bottom, and within each row columns from left to right.
So the output file size in bytes is twice the num- ber of
pixels in the image.</p>

<p>Each YUV code is associated with two pixels from the
input image that we will call the left pixel and the right
pixel. The 2nd byte of the code is the Y value of the left
pixel. The 4th byte of the code is the Y value of the right
pixel. The 1st byte of the code is an average of the U value
of the pixel to the left of the left pixel, the left pixel,
and the right pixel. The 3rd byte of the code is analogous
for V val- ues. These averages are weighted arithmetic means
where the left pixel is weighted double what the other two
pixels are weighted.</p>

<p>This format is reminiscent of but rather different from
the common YUV 4:2:0 format (aka YUV 420) and the similar
YUV 4:4:4, YUV 4:2:2, YUV 4:1:1, YUV 4:1:1s, and YUV 4:1:0.
In YUV 4:2:0, the raster is differ- ent for even numbered
lines and odd numbered lines. On even numbered lines, there
are twice as many bits for Y of each pixel as for U or V. On
odd numbered lines, there are the same number of bits for Y
as on even numbered lines, but no bits at all for U and
V.</p>

<p>Another YUV-based format is YUV4MPEG2, which is a movie
format normally used with MJPEGTools . Netpbm does not have
converters for this for- mat, but MJPEGTools does.</p>
