<p>NAME amgpgcrypt - reference crypt program for Amanda
public-key data encryption</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amgpgcrypt to be called by Amanda only</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION amgpgcrypt calls gpg to perform public-key
data encryption on Amanda backup. amgpgcrypt will search for
the gpg program in the following directories:
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin</p>

<p>amgpgcrypt sets GNUPGHOME to $AMANDA_HOME/.gnupg where
gpg will look for the gpg keys. amgpgcrypt uses the public
key to encrypt the Amanda data and uses the private key to
decrypt the Amanda backup data. Thus, passphrase is only
required at the time of data restore.</p>

<p>KEY AND PASSPHRASE amgpgcrypt uses the private key to
decrypt Amanda backup data.</p>

<p>It is very important to store, manage and protect the
key and the passphrase properly. Encrypted backup data can
only be recovered with the correct key and passphrase.</p>

<p>HOW TO CREATE ENCRYPTION KEYS AND PASSPHRASE FOR
AMGPGCRYPT Store the passphrase that you used in following
&quot;gpg --gen-key&quot; command inside the home-directory
of the AMANDA-user($amanda_user) and protect it with proper
permissions:</p>

<p>echo my_secret_passphrase &gt;
~$amanda_user/.am_passphrase chown $amanda_user:disk
~$amanda_user/.am_passphrase chmod 700
~$amanda_user/.am_passphrase</p>

<p>Run &quot;gpg --gen-key&quot;. Below is an example: $
gpg --gen-key gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.6; Copyright (C) 2004 Free
Software Foundation, Inc. This program comes with ABSOLUTELY
NO WARRANTY. This is free software, and you are welcome to
redistribute it under certain conditions. See the file
COPYING for details.</p>

<p>Please select what kind of key you want: (1) DSA and
ElGamal (default) (2) DSA (sign only) (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1 DSA keypair will have 1024 bits. About to
generate a new ELG-E keypair. minimum keysize is 768 bits
default keysize is 1024 bits highest suggested keysize is
2048 bits What keysize do you want? (1024) Requested keysize
is 1024 bits Please specify how long the key should be
valid. 0 = key does not expire (n) = key expires in n days
(n)w = key expires in n weeks (n)m = key expires in n months
(n)y = key expires in n years Key is valid for? (0) 6m Key
expires at Sun 06 Aug 2006 03:51:25 PM PDT Is this correct
(y/n)? y</p>

<p>You need a User-ID to identify your key; the software
constructs the user id from Real Name, Comment and Email
Address in this form: &quot;Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter)
(heinrichh@duesseldorf.de)&quot;</p>

<p>Real name: amandabackup Email address: Comment: gpg keys
for amandabackup You selected this USER-ID:
&quot;amandabackup (gpg keys for amandabackup)&quot;</p>

<p>Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.</p>

<p>We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good
idea to perform some other action (type on the keyboard,
move the mouse, utilize the disks) during the prime
generation; this gives the random number generator a better
chance to gain enough entropy.</p>

<p>FILES $AMANDA_HOME/.gnupg/pubring.gpg The public key.
amgpgcrypt encrypt data with this public key along with the
cipher algorithm.</p>

<p>$AMANDA_HOME/.gnupg/secring.gpg The private/secret key.
It&acute;s only needed during amrecover/amrestore. Store and
protect it properly during other time.</p>

<p>$AMANDA_HOME/.am_passphrase The passphrase. It&acute;s
only needed during amrecover/amrestore. Store and protect it
properly during other time.</p>

<p>BUGS Amanda has problem with gpg mdc(modification
detection code) in the binary mode. amgpgcrypt calls gpg
with mdc disabled</p>
