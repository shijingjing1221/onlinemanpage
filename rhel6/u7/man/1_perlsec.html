<p>PERLSEC(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLSEC(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlsec - Perl security</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Perl is designed to make it easy to program
securely even when running with extra privileges, like
setuid or setgid programs. Unlike most command line shells,
which are based on multiple substitution passes on each line
of the script, Perl uses a more conventional evaluation
scheme with fewer hidden snags. Additionally, because the
language has more builtin functionality, it can rely less
upon external (and possibly untrustworthy) programs to
accomplish its purposes.</p>

<p>SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION If you
believe you have found a security vulnerability in Perl,
please email perl5-security-report@perl.org with details.
This points to a closed subscription, unarchived mailing
list. Please only use this address for security issues in
the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.</p>

<p>SECURITY MECHANISMS AND CONCERNS Taint mode Perl
automatically enables a set of special security checks,
called taint mode, when it detects its program running with
differing real and effective user or group IDs. The setuid
bit in Unix permissions is mode 04000, the setgid bit mode
02000; either or both may be set. You can also enable taint
mode explicitly by using the -T command line flag. This flag
is strongly suggested for server programs and any program
run on behalf of someone else, such as a CGI script. Once
taint mode is on, its on for the remainder of your
script.</p>

<p>While in this mode, Perl takes special precautions
called taint checks to prevent both obvious and subtle
traps. Some of these checks are reasonably simple, such as
verifying that path directories arent writable by others;
careful programmers have always used checks like these.
Other checks, however, are best supported by the language
itself, and it is these checks especially that contribute to
making a set-id Perl program more secure than the
corresponding C program.</p>

<p>You may not use data derived from outside your program
to affect something else outside your program--at least, not
by accident. All command line arguments, environment
variables, locale information (see perllocale), results of
certain system calls (&quot;readdir()&quot;,
&quot;readlink()&quot;, the variable of
&quot;shmread()&quot;, the messages returned by
&quot;msgrcv()&quot;, the password, gcos and shell fields
returned by the &quot;getpwxxx()&quot; calls), and all file
input are marked as &quot;tainted&quot;. Tainted data may
not be used directly or indirectly in any command that
invokes a sub-shell, nor in any command that modifies files,
directories, or processes, with the following
exceptions:</p>

<p>&middot; Arguments to &quot;print&quot; and
&quot;syswrite&quot; are not checked for taintedness.</p>

<p>&middot; Symbolic methods</p>

<p>$obj-&gt;$method(@args);</p>

<p>and symbolic sub references</p>

<p>&amp;{$foo}(@args); $foo-&gt;(@args);</p>

<p>are not checked for taintedness. This requires extra
carefulness unless you want external data to affect your
control flow. Unless you carefully limit what these symbolic
values are, people are able to call functions outside your
Perl code, such as POSIX::system, in which case they are
able to run arbitrary external code.</p>

<p>&middot; Hash keys are never tainted.</p>

<p>For efficiency reasons, Perl takes a conservative view
of whether data is tainted. If an expression contains
tainted data, any subexpression may be considered tainted,
even if the value of the subexpression is not itself
affected by the tainted data.</p>

<p>Because taintedness is associated with each scalar
value, some elements of an array or hash can be tainted and
others not. The keys of a hash are never tainted.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>$arg = shift; # $arg is tainted $hid = $arg,
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;; # $hid is also tainted $line = &lt;&gt;;
# Tainted $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;; # Also tainted open FOO,
&quot;/home/me/bar&quot; or die $!; $line = &lt;FOO&gt;; #
Still tainted $path = $ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;}; # Tainted,
but see below $data = &rsquo;abc&rsquo;; # Not tainted</p>

<p>system &quot;echo $arg&quot;; # Insecure system
&quot;/bin/echo&quot;, $arg; # Considered insecure # (Perl
doesn&rsquo;t know about /bin/echo) system &quot;echo
$hid&quot;; # Insecure system &quot;echo $data&quot;; #
Insecure until PATH set</p>

<p>$path = $ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;}; # $path now
tainted</p>

<p>$ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;} = &rsquo;/bin:/usr/bin&rsquo;;
delete @ENV{&rsquo;IFS&rsquo;, &rsquo;CDPATH&rsquo;,
&rsquo;ENV&rsquo;, &rsquo;BASH_ENV&rsquo;};</p>

<p>$path = $ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;}; # $path now NOT
tainted system &quot;echo $data&quot;; # Is secure now!</p>

<p>open(FOO, &quot;&lt; $arg&quot;); # OK - read-only file
open(FOO, &quot;&gt; $arg&quot;); # Not OK - trying to
write</p>

<p>open(FOO,&quot;echo $arg|&quot;); # Not OK
open(FOO,&quot;-|&quot;) or exec &rsquo;echo&rsquo;, $arg; #
Also not OK</p>

<p>$shout = &lsquo;echo $arg&lsquo;; # Insecure, $shout now
tainted</p>

<p>unlink $data, $arg; # Insecure umask $arg; #
Insecure</p>

<p>exec &quot;echo $arg&quot;; # Insecure exec
&quot;echo&quot;, $arg; # Insecure exec &quot;sh&quot;,
&rsquo;-c&rsquo;, $arg; # Very insecure!</p>

<p>@files = &lt;*.c&gt;; # insecure (uses readdir() or
similar) @files = glob(&rsquo;*.c&rsquo;); # insecure (uses
readdir() or similar)</p>

<p># In Perl releases older than 5.6.0 the &lt;*.c&gt; and
glob(&rsquo;*.c&rsquo;) would # have used an external
program to do the filename expansion; but in # either case
the result is tainted since the list of filenames comes #
from outside of the program.</p>

<p>$bad = ($arg, 23); # $bad will be tainted $arg,
&lsquo;true&lsquo;; # Insecure (although it isn&rsquo;t
really)</p>

<p>If you try to do something insecure, you will get a
fatal error saying something like &quot;Insecure
dependency&quot; or &quot;Insecure $ENV{PATH}&quot;.</p>

<p>The exception to the principle of &quot;one tainted
value taints the whole expression&quot; is with the ternary
conditional operator &quot;?:&quot;. Since code with a
ternary conditional</p>

<p>$result = $tainted_value ? &quot;Untainted&quot; :
&quot;Also untainted&quot;;</p>

<p>is effectively</p>

<p>if ( $tainted_value ) { $result = &quot;Untainted&quot;;
} else { $result = &quot;Also untainted&quot;; }</p>

<p>it doesnt make sense for $result to be tainted.</p>

<p>Laundering and Detecting Tainted Data To test whether a
variable contains tainted data, and whose use would thus
trigger an &quot;Insecure dependency&quot; message, you can
use the &quot;tainted()&quot; function of the Scalar::Util
module, available in your nearby CPAN mirror, and included
in Perl starting from the release 5.8.0. Or you may be able
to use the following &quot;is_tainted()&quot; function.</p>

<p>sub is_tainted { return ! eval { eval(&quot;#&quot; .
substr(join(&quot;&quot;, @_), 0, 0)); 1 }; }</p>

<p>This function makes use of the fact that the presence of
tainted data anywhere within an expression renders the
entire expression tainted. It would be inefficient for every
operator to test every argument for taintedness. Instead,
the slightly more efficient and conservative approach is
used that if any tainted value has been accessed within the
same expression, the whole expression is considered
tainted.</p>

<p>But testing for taintedness gets you only so far.
Sometimes you have just to clear your data s taintedness.
Values may be untainted by using them as keys in a hash;
otherwise the only way to bypass the tainting mechanism is
by referencing subpatterns from a regular expression match.
Perl presumes that if you reference a substring using $1,
$2, etc., that you knew what you were doing when you wrote
the pattern. That means using a bit of thought--dont just
blindly untaint anything, or you defeat the entire
mechanism. Its better to verify that the variable has only
good characters (for certain values of &quot;good&quot;)
rather than checking whether it has any bad characters.
Thats because its far too easy to miss bad characters that
you never thought of.</p>

<p>Heres a test to make sure that the data contains nothing
but &quot;word&quot; characters (alphabetics, numerics, and
underscores), a hyphen, an at sign, or a dot.</p>

<p>if ($data =~ /^([-@192 $data = $1; # $data now untainted
} else { die &quot;Bad data in &rsquo;$data&rsquo;&quot;; #
log this somewhere }</p>

<p>This is fairly secure because &quot;/720 metacharacters,
nor are dot, dash, or at going to mean something special to
the shell. Use of &quot;/.+/&quot; would have been insecure
in theory because it lets everything through, but Perl
doesnt check for that. The lesson is that when untainting,
you must be exceedingly careful with your patterns.
Laundering data using regular expression is the only
mechanism for untainting dirty data, unless you use the
strategy detailed below to fork a child of lesser
privilege.</p>

<p>The example does not untaint $data if &quot;use
locale&quot; is in effect, because the characters matched by
&quot;720 Perl considers that locale definitions are
untrustworthy because they contain data from outside the
program. If you are writing a locale- aware program, and
want to launder data with a regular expression containing
&quot;144no locale&quot; ahead of the expression in the same
block. See &quot;SECURITY&quot; in perllocale for further
discussion and examples.</p>

<p>Switches On the &quot;#!&quot; Line When you make a
script executable, in order to make it usable as a command,
the system will pass switches to perl from the scripts #!
line. Perl checks that any command line switches given to a
setuid (or setgid) script actually match the ones set on the
#! line. Some Unix and Unix-like environments impose a
one-switch limit on the #! line, so you may need to use
something like &quot;-wU&quot; instead of &quot;-w -U&quot;
under such systems. (This issue should arise only in Unix or
Unix-like environments that support #! and setuid or setgid
scripts.)</p>

<p>Taint mode and @INC When the taint mode (&quot;-T&quot;)
is in effect, the &quot;.&quot; directory is removed from
@INC, and the environment variables &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; and
&quot;PERLLIB&quot; are ignored by Perl. You can still
adjust @INC from outside the program by using the
&quot;-I&quot; command line option as explained in perlrun.
The two environment variables are ignored because they are
obscured, and a user running a program could be unaware that
they are set, whereas the &quot;-I&quot; option is clearly
visible and therefore permitted.</p>

<p>Another way to modify @INC without modifying the
program, is to use the &quot;lib&quot; pragma, e.g.:</p>

<p>perl -Mlib=/foo program</p>

<p>The benefit of using &quot;-Mlib=/foo&quot; over
&quot;-I/foo&quot;, is that the former will automagically
remove any duplicated directories, while the later will
not.</p>

<p>Note that if a tainted string is added to @INC, the
following problem will be reported:</p>

<p>Insecure dependency in require while running with -T
switch</p>

<p>Cleaning Up Your Path For &quot;Insecure
$ENV{PATH}&quot; messages, you need to set
$ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;} to a known value, and each
directory in the path must be absolute and non- writable by
others than its owner and group. You may be surprised to get
this message even if the pathname to your executable is
fully qualified. This is not generated because you didnt
supply a full path to the program; instead, its generated
because you never set your PATH environment variable, or you
didnt set it to something that was safe. Because Perl can t
guarantee that the executable in question isnt itself going
to turn around and execute some other program that is
dependent on your PATH, it makes sure you set the PATH.</p>

<p>The PATH isnt the only environment variable which can
cause problems. Because some shells may use the variables
IFS, CDPATH, ENV, and BASH_ENV, Perl checks that those are
either empty or untainted when starting subprocesses. You
may wish to add something like this to your setid and
taint-checking scripts.</p>

<p>delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)}; # Make %ENV
safer</p>

<p>It s also possible to get into trouble with other
operations that dont care whether they use tainted values.
Make judicious use of the file tests in dealing with any
user-supplied filenames. When possible, do opens and such
after properly dropping any special user (or group!)
privileges. Perl doesnt prevent you from opening tainted
filenames for reading, so be careful what you print out. The
tainting mechanism is intended to prevent stupid mistakes,
not to remove the need for thought.</p>

<p>Perl does not call the shell to expand wild cards when
you pass &quot;system&quot; and &quot;exec&quot; explicit
parameter lists instead of strings with possible shell
wildcards in them. Unfortunately, the &quot;open&quot;,
&quot;glob&quot;, and backtick functions provide no such
alternate calling convention, so more subterfuge will be
required.</p>

<p>Perl provides a reasonably safe way to open a file or
pipe from a setuid or setgid program: just create a child
process with reduced privilege who does the dirty work for
you. First, fork a child using the special &quot;open&quot;
syntax that connects the parent and child by a pipe. Now the
child resets its ID set and any other per-process
attributes, like environment variables, umasks, current
working directories, back to the originals or known safe
values. Then the child process, which no longer has any
special permissions, does the &quot;open&quot; or other
system call. Finally, the child passes the data it managed
to access back to the parent. Because the file or pipe was
opened in the child while running under less privilege than
the parent, its not apt to be tricked into doing something
it shouldnt.</p>

<p>Heres a way to do backticks reasonably safely. Notice
how the &quot;exec&quot; is not called with a string that
the shell could expand. This is by far the best way to call
something that might be subjected to shell escapes: just
never call the shell at all.</p>

<p>use English &rsquo;-no_match_vars&rsquo;; die
&quot;Can&rsquo;t fork: $!&quot; unless defined($pid =
open(KID, &quot;-|&quot;)); if ($pid) { # parent while
(&lt;KID&gt;) { # do something } close KID; } else { my
@temp = ($EUID, $EGID); my $orig_uid = $UID; my $orig_gid =
$GID; $EUID = $UID; $EGID = $GID; # Drop privileges $UID =
$orig_uid; $GID = $orig_gid; # Make sure privs are really
gone ($EUID, $EGID) = @temp; die &quot;Can&rsquo;t drop
privileges&quot; unless $UID == $EUID &amp;&amp; $GID eq
$EGID; $ENV{PATH} = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;; # Minimal
PATH. # Consider sanitizing the environment even more. exec
&rsquo;myprog&rsquo;, &rsquo;arg1&rsquo;, &rsquo;arg2&rsquo;
or die &quot;can&rsquo;t exec myprog: $!&quot;; }</p>

<p>A similar strategy would work for wildcard expansion via
&quot;glob&quot;, although you can use &quot;readdir&quot;
instead.</p>

<p>Taint checking is most useful when although you trust
yourself not to have written a program to give away the
farm, you dont necessarily trust those who end up using it
not to try to trick it into doing something bad. This is the
kind of security checking that s useful for set-id programs
and programs launched on someone else s behalf, like CGI
programs.</p>

<p>This is quite different, however, from not even trusting
the writer of the code not to try to do something evil.
Thats the kind of trust needed when someone hands you a
program youve never seen before and says, &quot;Here, run
this.&quot; For that kind of safety, check out the Safe
module, included standard in the Perl distribution. This
module allows the programmer to set up special compartments
in which all system operations are trapped and namespace
access is carefully controlled.</p>

<p>Security Bugs Beyond the obvious problems that stem from
giving special privileges to systems as flexible as scripts,
on many versions of Unix, set-id scripts are inherently
insecure right from the start. The problem is a race
condition in the kernel. Between the time the kernel opens
the file to see which interpreter to run and when the
(now-set-id) interpreter turns around and reopens the file
to interpret it, the file in question may have changed,
especially if you have symbolic links on your system.</p>

<p>Fortunately, sometimes this kernel &quot;feature&quot;
can be disabled. Unfortunately, there are two ways to
disable it. The system can simply outlaw scripts with any
set-id bit set, which doesnt help much. Alternately, it can
simply ignore the set-id bits on scripts. If the latter is
true, Perl can emulate the setuid and setgid mechanism when
it notices the otherwise useless setuid/gid bits on Perl
scripts. It does this via a special executable called
suidperl that is automatically invoked for you if its
needed.</p>

<p>The use of suidperl is considered deprecated, and will
be removed in Perl 5.12.0. It is strongly recommended that
all code uses the simplier and more secure C-wrappers
described below.</p>

<p>If the kernel set-id script feature isn t disabled, Perl
will complain loudly that your set-id script is insecure.
Youll need to either disable the kernel set-id script
feature, or put a C wrapper around the script. A C wrapper
is just a compiled program that does nothing except call
your Perl program. Compiled programs are not subject to the
kernel bug that plagues set-id scripts. Heres a simple
wrapper, written in C:</p>

<p>#define REAL_PATH &quot;/path/to/script&quot; main(ac,
av) char **av; { execv(REAL_PATH, av); }</p>

<p>Compile this wrapper into a binary executable and then
make it rather than your script setuid or setgid.</p>

<p>In recent years, vendors have begun to supply systems
free of this inherent security bug. On such systems, when
the kernel passes the name of the set-id script to open to
the interpreter, rather than using a pathname subject to
meddling, it instead passes /dev/fd/3. This is a special
file already opened on the script, so that there can be no
race condition for evil scripts to exploit. On these
systems, Perl should be compiled with
&quot;-DSETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW&quot;. The Configure
program that builds Perl tries to figure this out for
itself, so you should never have to specify this yourself.
Most modern releases of SysVr4 and BSD 4.4 use this approach
to avoid the kernel race condition.</p>

<p>Prior to release 5.6.1 of Perl, bugs in the code of
suidperl could introduce a security hole. The use of
suidperl is considered deprecated, and will be removed in
Perl 5.12.0.</p>

<p>Protecting Your Programs There are a number of ways to
hide the source to your Perl programs, with varying levels
of &quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p>First of all, however, you cant take away read
permission, because the source code has to be readable in
order to be compiled and interpreted. (That doesnt mean that
a CGI scripts source is readable by people on the web,
though.) So you have to leave the permissions at the
socially friendly 0755 level. This lets people on your local
system only see your source.</p>

<p>Some people mistakenly regard this as a security
problem. If your program does insecure things, and relies on
people not knowing how to exploit those insecurities, it is
not secure. It is often possible for someone to determine
the insecure things and exploit them without viewing the
source. Security through obscurity, the name for hiding your
bugs instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p>You can try using encryption via source filters
(Filter::* from CPAN, or Filter::Util::Call and
Filter::Simple since Perl 5.8). But crackers might be able
to decrypt it. You can try using the byte code compiler and
interpreter described below, but crackers might be able to
de- compile it. You can try using the native-code compiler
described below, but crackers might be able to disassemble
it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty to people
wanting to get at your code, but none can definitively
conceal it (this is true of every language, not just
Perl).</p>

<p>If youre concerned about people profiting from your
code, then the bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive
license will give you legal security. License your software
and pepper it with threatening statements like &quot;This is
unpublished proprietary software of XYZ Corp. Your access to
it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; You should see a lawyer to be sure your license
s wording will stand up in court.</p>

<p>Unicode Unicode is a new and complex technology and one
may easily overlook certain security pitfalls. See
perluniintro for an overview and perlunicode for details,
and &quot;Security Implications of Unicode&quot; in
perlunicode for security implications in particular.</p>

<p>Algorithmic Complexity Attacks Certain internal
algorithms used in the implementation of Perl can be
attacked by choosing the input carefully to consume large
amounts of either time or space or both. This can lead into
the so-called Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</p>

<p>&middot; Hash Function - the algorithm used to
&quot;order&quot; hash elements has been changed several
times during the development of Perl, mainly to be
reasonably fast. In Perl 5.8.1 also the security aspect was
taken into account.</p>

<p>In Perls before 5.8.1 one could rather easily generate
data that as hash keys would cause Perl to consume large
amounts of time because internal structure of hashes would
badly degenerate. In Perl 5.8.1 the hash function is
randomly perturbed by a pseudorandom seed which makes
generating such naughty hash keys harder. See
&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; in perlrun for more
information.</p>

<p>In Perl 5.8.1 the random perturbation was done by
default, but as of 5.8.2 it is only used on individual
hashes if the internals detect the insertion of pathological
data. If one wants for some reason emulate the old behaviour
(and expose oneself to DoS attacks) one can set the
environment variable PERL_HASH_SEED to zero to disable the
protection (or any other integer to force a known
perturbation, rather than random). One possible reason for
wanting to emulate the old behaviour is that in the new
behaviour consecutive runs of Perl will order hash keys
differently, which may confuse some applications (like
Data::Dumper: the outputs of two different runs are no
longer identical).</p>

<p>Perl has never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys,
and the ordering has already changed several times during
the lifetime of Perl 5. Also, the ordering of hash keys has
always been, and continues to be, affected by the insertion
order.</p>

<p>Also note that while the order of the hash elements
might be randomised, this &quot;pseudoordering&quot; should
not be used for applications like shuffling a list randomly
(use List::Util::shuffle() for that, see List::Util, a
standard core module since Perl 5.8.0; or the CPAN module
Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle), or for generating
permutations (use e.g. the CPAN modules Algorithm::Permute
or Algorithm::FastPermute), or for any cryptographic
applications.</p>

<p>&middot; Regular expressions - Perls regular expression
engine is so called NFA (Non-deterministic Finite
Automaton), which among other things means that it can
rather easily consume large amounts of both time and space
if the regular expression may match in several ways. Careful
crafting of the regular expressions can help but quite often
there really isnt much one can do (the book &quot;Mastering
Regular Expressions&quot; is required reading, see
perlfaq2). Running out of space manifests itself by Perl
running out of memory.</p>

<p>&middot; Sorting - the quicksort algorithm used in Perls
before 5.8.0 to implement the sort() function is very easy
to trick into misbehaving so that it consumes a lot of time.
Starting from Perl 5.8.0 a different sorting algorithm,
mergesort, is used by default. Mergesort cannot misbehave on
any input.</p>

<p>See &lt;http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/&gt; for
more information, and any computer science textbook on
algorithmic complexity.</p>
