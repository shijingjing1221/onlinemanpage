<p>READDIR(2) Linux Programmer s Manual READDIR(2)</p>

<p>NAME readdir - read directory entry</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int readdir(unsigned int fd, struct
old_linux_dirent *dirp, unsigned int count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is not the function you are interested
in. Look at readdir(3) for the POSIX conforming C library
interface. This page documents the bare kernel system call
interface, which is superseded by getdents(2).</p>

<p>readdir() reads one old_linux_dirent structure from the
directory referred to by the file descriptor fd into the
buffer pointed to by dirp. The argument count is ignored; at
most one old_linux_dirent structure is read.</p>

<p>The old_linux_dirent structure is declared as
follows:</p>

<p>struct old_linux_dirent { long d_ino; /* inode number */
off_t d_off; /* offset to this old_linux_dirent */ unsigned
short d_reclen; /* length of this d_name */ char
d_name[NAME_MAX+1]; /* filename (null-terminated) */ }</p>

<p>d_ino is an inode number. d_off is the distance from the
start of the directory to this old_linux_dirent. d_reclen is
the size of d_name, not counting the null terminator. d_name
is a null-terminated file- name.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, 1 is returned. On end of
directory, 0 is returned. On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF Invalid file descriptor fd.</p>

<p>EFAULT Argument points outside the calling process s
address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL Result buffer is too small.</p>

<p>ENOENT No such directory.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR File descriptor does not refer to a
directory.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system
call; call it using syscall(2). You will need to define the
old_linux_dirent structure yourself.</p>

man-pages project. A description of the project, and
