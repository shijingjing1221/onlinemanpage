<p>NAME pmprobe - lightweight probe for performance
metrics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmprobe [-fIiLVvz] [-a archive] [-h hostname]
[-K spec] [-n pmnsfile] [-O time] [-Z timezone] [metricname
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmprobe determines the availability of
performance metrics exported through the facilities of the
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).</p>

<p>The metrics of interest are named in the metricname
arguments. If met- ricname is a non-leaf node in the
Performance Metrics Name Space (pmns(5)), then pmprobe will
recursively descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes.
If no metricname argument is given, the root of the
namespace is used.</p>

<p>The output format is spartan and intended for use in
wrapper scripts creating configuration files for other PCP
tools. By default, there is one line of output per metric,
with the metric name followed by a count of the number of
available values. Error conditions are encoded as a negative
value count (as per the PMAPI(3) protocols, but may be
decoded using pmerr(1)) and followed by a textual
description of the error.</p>

<p>Unless directed to another host by the -h option,
pmprobe will contact the Performance Metrics Collector
Daemon (PMCD) on the local host.</p>

<p>The -a option causes pmprobe to use the specified
archive rather than connecting to a PMCD. The -a and -h
options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The -L option causes pmprobe to use a local context to
collect metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.
Only some metrics are available in this mode. The -a,-h and
-L options are mutually exclu- sive.</p>

<p>Normally pmprobe operates on the distributed Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however, if the -n option is
specified an alternative local PMNS file is loaded from the
file pmnsfile.</p>

<p>Other options control the output of additional
information when one or more values is available.</p>

<p>-f When used with -i or -I the set of instances reported
will be all of those known at the source of the performance
data. By default the set of reported instances are those for
which values are cur- rently available, which may be smaller
than the set reported with -f.</p>

<p>-I Report the external identifiers for each instance.
The literal string PM_IN_NULL is reported for singular
metrics.</p>

<p>-i Report the internal identifiers for each instance.
The values are in decimal and prefixed by ?. As a special
case, the literal string PM_IN_NULL is reported for singular
metrics.</p>

<p>-K When using the -L option to fetch metrics from a
local context, the -K option may be used to control the DSO
PMDAs that should be made accessible. The spec argument
conforms to the syntax described in __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).
More than one -K option may be used.</p>

<p>-O When used in conjunction with an archive source of
metrics and the -v option the time argument defines a time
origin at which the metrics should be fetched from the
archive. Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of
this option, and the syntax for the time argument.</p>

<p>When the ctime format is used for the time argument in a
-O option, the timezone becomes an issue. The default is to
use the local timezone on the system where pmprobe is run.
The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(5).
The -z option changes the timezone to the local timezone at
the host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
identified via the -a option.</p>

<p>-v Report the value for each instance, as per the
formatting rules of pmPrintValue(3). When fetching from an
archive, only those instances present in the first archive
record for a metric will be displayed; see also the -O
option.</p>

<p>The -v option is mutually exclusive with either the -I
or -i options.</p>

<p>The -V option provides a cryptic summary of the number
of messages sent and received across the PMAPI
interface.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
