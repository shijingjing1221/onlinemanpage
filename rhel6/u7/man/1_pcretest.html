<p>PCRETEST(1) PCRETEST(1)</p>

<p>NAME pcretest - a program for testing Perl-compatible
regular expressions.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS</p>

<p>pcretest [options] [source] [destination]</p>

<p>pcretest was written as a test program for the PCRE
regular expression library itself, but it can also be used
for experimenting with regular expressions. This document
describes the features of the test program; for details of
the regular expressions themselves, see the pcrepattern
documentation. For details of the PCRE library function
calls and their options, see the pcreapi documentation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS</p>

<p>-b Behave as if each regex has the /B (show byte code)
modifier; the internal form is output after compilation.</p>

<p>-C Output the version number of the PCRE library, and
all avail- able information about the optional features that
are included, and then exit.</p>

<p>-d Behave as if each regex has the /D (debug) modifier;
the internal form and information about the compiled pattern
is output after compilation; -d is equivalent to -b -i.</p>

<p>-dfa Behave as if each data line contains the sequence;
this causes the alternative matching function,
pcre_dfa_exec(), to be used instead of the standard
pcre_exec() function (more detail is given below).</p>

<p>-help Output a brief summary these options and then
exit.</p>

<p>-i Behave as if each regex has the /I modifier;
information about the compiled pattern is given after
compilation.</p>

<p>-m Output the size of each compiled pattern after it has
been compiled. This is equivalent to adding /M to each
regular expression. For compatibility with earlier versions
of pcretest, -s is a synonym for -m.</p>

<p>-o osize Set the number of elements in the output vector
that is used when calling pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec() to
be osize. The default value is 45, which is enough for 14
capturing subex- pressions for pcre_exec() or 22 different
matches for pcre_dfa_exec(). The vector size can be changed
for individ- ual matching calls by including in the data
line (see below).</p>

<p>-p Behave as if each regex has the /P modifier; the
POSIX wrap- per API is used to call PCRE. None of the other
options has any effect when -p is set.</p>

<p>-q Do not output the version number of pcretest at the
start of execution.</p>

<p>-S size On Unix-like systems, set the size of the
run-time stack to size megabytes.</p>

<p>-t Run each compile, study, and match many times with a
timer, and output resulting time per compile or match (in
milliseconds). Do not set -m with -t, because you will then
get the size output a zillion times, and the timing will be
distorted. You can control the number of iterations that are
used for timing by following -t with a number (as a separate
item on the command line). For example, &quot;-t 1000&quot;
would iter- ate 1000 times. The default is to iterate 500000
times.</p>

<p>-tm This is like -t except that it times only the
matching phase, not the compile or study phases.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>If pcretest is given two filename arguments, it reads
from the first and writes to the second. If it is given only
one filename argument, it reads from that file and writes to
stdout. Otherwise, it reads from stdin and writes to stdout,
and prompts for each line of input, using &quot;re&gt;&quot;
to prompt for regular expressions, and &quot;data&gt;&quot;
to prompt for data lines.</p>

<p>When pcretest is built, a configuration option can
specify that it should be linked with the libreadline
library. When this is done, if the input is from a terminal,
it is read using the readline() function. This provides
line-editing and history facilities. The output from the
-help option states whether or not readline() will be
used.</p>

<p>The program handles any number of sets of input on a
single input file. Each set starts with a regular
expression, and continues with any num- ber of data lines to
be matched against the pattern.</p>

<p>Each data line is matched separately and independently.
If you want to do multi-line matches, you have to use the
escape sequenceor (or 0 etc., depending on the newline
setting) in a single line of input to encode the newline
sequences. There is no limit on the length of data lines;
the input buffer is automatically extended if it is too
small.</p>

<p>An empty line signals the end of the data lines, at
which point a new regular expression is read. The regular
expressions are given enclosed in any non-alphanumeric
delimiters other than backslash, for example:</p>

<p>/(a|bc)x+yz/</p>

<p>White space before the initial delimiter is ignored. A
regular expres- sion may be continued over several input
lines, in which case the new- line characters are included
within it. It is possible to include the delimiter within
the pattern by escaping it, for example</p>

<p>/abcdef/</p>

<p>If you do so, the escape and the delimiter form part of
the pattern, but since delimiters are always
non-alphanumeric, this does not affect its interpretation.
If the terminating delimiter is immediately fol- lowed by a
backslash, for example,</p>

<p>/abc/ then a backslash is added to the end of the
pattern. This is done to provide a way of testing the error
condition that arises if a pattern finishes with a
backslash, because</p>

<p>/abc</p>

<p>is interpreted as the first line of a pattern that
starts with &quot;abc/&quot;, causing pcretest to read the
next line as a continuation of the regular expression.</p>

<p>PATTERN MODIFIERS</p>

<p>A pattern may be followed by any number of modifiers,
which are mostly single characters. Following Perl usage,
these are referred to below as, for example, &quot;the /i
modifier&quot;, even though the delimiter of the pattern
need not always be a slash, and no slash is used when
writing modifiers. White space may appear between the final
pattern delimiter and the first modifier, and between the
modifiers themselves.</p>

<p>The /i, /m, /s, and /x modifiers set the PCRE_CASELESS,
PCRE_MULTILINE, PCRE_DOTALL, or PCRE_EXTENDED options,
respectively, when pcre_com- pile() is called. These four
modifier letters have the same effect as they do in Perl.
For example:</p>

<p>/caseless/i</p>

<p>The following table shows additional modifiers for
setting PCRE options that do not correspond to anything in
Perl:</p>

<p>/A PCRE_ANCHORED /C PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT /E
PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY /f PCRE_FIRSTLINE /J PCRE_DUPNAMES /N
PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE /U PCRE_UNGREEDY /X PCRE_EXTRA
/&lt;JS&gt; PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT /&lt;cr&gt;
PCRE_NEWLINE_CR /&lt;lf&gt; PCRE_NEWLINE_LF /&lt;crlf&gt;
PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF /&lt;anycrlf&gt; PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF
/&lt;any&gt; PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY /&lt;bsr_anycrlf&gt;
PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF /&lt;bsr_unicode&gt; PCRE_BSR_UNICODE</p>

<p>Those specifying line ending sequences are literal
strings as shown, but the letters can be in either case.
This example sets multiline matching with CRLF as the line
ending sequence:</p>

<p>/^abc/m&lt;crlf&gt;</p>

<p>Details of the meanings of these PCRE options are given
in the pcreapi documentation.</p>

<p>Finding all matches in a string</p>

<p>Searching for all possible matches within each subject
string can be requested by the /g or /G modifier. After
finding a match, PCRE is called again to search the
remainder of the subject string. The differ- ence between /g
and /G is that the former uses the startoffset argument to
pcre_exec() to start searching at a new point within the
entire string (which is in effect what Perl does), whereas
the latter passes over a shortened substring. This makes a
difference to the matching process if the pattern begins
with a lookbehind assertion o r (including 0 .</p>

<p>If any call to pcre_exec() in a /g or /G sequence
matches an empty string, the next call is done with the
PCRE_NOTEMPTY and PCRE_ANCHORED flags set in order to search
for another, non-empty, match at the same point. If this
second match fails, the start offset is advanced by one, and
the normal match is retried. This imitates the way Perl han-
dles such cases when using the /g modifier or the split()
function.</p>

<p>Other modifiers</p>

<p>There are yet more modifiers for controlling the way
pcretest operates.</p>

<p>The /+ modifier requests that as well as outputting the
substring that matched the entire pattern, pcretest should
in addition output the remainder of the subject string. This
is useful for tests where the subject contains multiple
copies of the same substring.</p>

<p>The /B modifier is a debugging feature. It requests that
pcretest out- put a representation of the compiled byte code
after compilation. Nor- mally this information contains
length and offset values; however, if /Z is also present,
this data is replaced by spaces. This is a special feature
for use in the automatic test scripts; it ensures that the
same output is generated for different internal link
sizes.</p>

<p>The /L modifier must be followed directly by the name of
a locale, for example,</p>

<p>/pattern/Lfr_FR</p>

<p>For this reason, it must be the last modifier. The given
locale is set, pcre_maketables() is called to build a set of
character tables for the locale, and this is then passed to
pcre_compile() when compiling the regular expression.
Without an /L modifier, NULL is passed as the tables
pointer; that is, /L applies only to the expression on which
it appears.</p>

<p>The /I modifier requests that pcretest output
information about the compiled pattern (whether it is
anchored, has a fixed first character, and so on). It does
this by calling pcre_fullinfo() after compiling a pattern.
If the pattern is studied, the results of that are also out-
put.</p>

<p>The /D modifier is a PCRE debugging feature, and is
equivalent to /BI, that is, both the /B and the /I
modifiers.</p>

<p>The /F modifier causes pcretest to flip the byte order
of the fields in the compiled pattern that contain 2-byte
and 4-byte numbers. This facility is for testing the feature
in PCRE that allows it to execute patterns that were
compiled on a host with a different endianness. This feature
is not available when the POSIX interface to PCRE is being
used, that is, when the /P pattern modifier is specified.
See also the section about saving and reloading compiled
patterns below.</p>

<p>The /S modifier causes pcre_study() to be called after
the expression has been compiled, and the results used when
the expression is matched.</p>

<p>The /M modifier causes the size of memory block used to
hold the com- piled pattern to be output.</p>

<p>The /P modifier causes pcretest to call PCRE via the
POSIX wrapper API rather than its native API. When this is
done, all other modifiers except /i, /m, and /+ are ignored.
REG_ICASE is set if /i is present, and REG_NEWLINE is set if
/m is present. The wrapper functions force
PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY always, and PCRE_DOTALL unless
REG_NEWLINE is set.</p>

<p>The /8 modifier causes pcretest to call PCRE with the
PCRE_UTF8 option set. This turns on support for UTF-8
character handling in PCRE, pro- vided that it was compiled
with this support enabled. This modifier also causes any
non-printing characters in output strings to be printed
using the h...} notation if they are valid UTF-8
sequences.</p>

<p>If the /? modifier is used with /8, it causes pcretest
to call pcre_compile() with the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK option,
to suppress the checking of the string for UTF-8
validity.</p>

<p>DATA LINES</p>

<p>Before each data line is passed to pcre_exec(), leading
and trailing white space is removed, and it is then scanned
for escapes. Some of these are pretty esoteric features,
intended for checking out some of the more complicated
features of PCRE. If you are just testing &quot;ordi-
nary&quot; regular expressions, you probably dont need any
of these. The following escapes are recognized:</p>

<p>alarm (BEL, 7) backspace (8) \ escape (7) form feed (c)
newline (a) qdd set the PCRE_MATCH_LIMIT limit to dd (any
number of digits)carriage return (d) tab (9) vertical tab

character (up to 2 hex digits) h...} hexadecimal character,
any number of digits in UTF-8 mode 0 pass the PCRE_ANCHORED
option to pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec() 0 pass the
PCRE_NOTBOL option to pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec() call
pcre_copy_substring() for substring dd after a successful
match (number less than 32) call pcre_copy_named_substring()
for substring &quot;name&quot; after a successful match
(name terminated by next non-alphanumeric character) show
the current captured substrings at callout time do not
supply a callout function return 1 instead of 0 when callout
number n is reached m return 1 instead of 0 when callout
number n is reached for the nth time pass the number n (may
be negative) as callout data; this is used as the callout
return value use the pcre_dfa_exec() match function only
shortest match for pcre_dfa_exec() Gdd call
pcre_get_substring() for substring dd after a successful
match (number less than 32) Gname call
pcre_get_named_substring() for substring &quot;name&quot;
after a successful match (name terminated by next
non-alphanumeric character) call pcre_get_substringlist()
after a successful match discover the minimum MATCH_LIMIT
and MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION settings pass the PCRE_NOTEMPTY
option to pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec() d set the size of
the output vector passed to pcre_exec() to dd (any number of
digits) P pass the PCRE_PARTIAL option to pcre_exec() or
pcre_dfa_exec() Qdd set the PCRE_MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION limit
to dd (any number of digits) pass the PCRE_DFA_RESTART
option to pcre_dfa_exec() output details of memory get/free
calls during matching pass the PCRE_NOTEOL option to
pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec() pcre_exec() or
pcre_dfa_exec() &gt;dd start the match at offset dd
(optional &quot;-&quot;; then any number of digits); this
sets the startoffset argument for pcre_exec() or
pcre_dfa_exec() &lt;cr&gt; pass the PCRE_NEWLINE_CR option
to pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec() &lt;lf&gt; pass the
PCRE_NEWLINE_LF option to pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec()
&lt;crlf&gt; pass the PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF option to
pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec() &lt;anycrlf&gt; pass the
PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF option to pcre_exec() or
pcre_dfa_exec() &lt;any&gt; pass the PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY option
to pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec()</p>

<p>The escapes that specify line ending sequences are
literal strings, exactly as shown. No more than one newline
setting should be present in any data line.</p>

<p>A backslash followed by anything else just escapes the
anything else. If the very last character is a backslash, it
is ignored. This gives a way of passing an empty line as
data, since a real empty line termi- nates the data
input.</p>

<p>If is present, pcretest calls pcre_exec() several times,
with dif- ferent values in the match_limit and
match_limit_recursion fields of the pcre_extra data
structure, until it finds the minimum numbers for each
parameter that allow pcre_exec() to complete. The
match_limit num- ber is a measure of the amount of
backtracking that takes place, and checking it out can be
instructive. For most simple matches, the number is quite
small, but for patterns with very large numbers of matching
possibilities, it can become large very quickly with
increasing length of subject string. The
match_limit_recursion number is a measure of how much stack
(or, if PCRE is compiled with NO_RECURSE, how much heap)
memory is needed to complete the match attempt.</p>

<p>When is used, the value specified may be higher or lower
than the size set by the -O command line option (or
defaulted to 45); applies only to the call of pcre_exec()
for the line in which it appears.</p>

<p>If the /P modifier was present on the pattern, causing
the POSIX wrap- per API to be used, the only option-setting
sequences that have any effect are 0and causing REG_NOTBOL
and REG_NOTEOrespectively, to be passed to regexec().</p>

<p>The use of h...} to represent UTF-8 characters is not
dependent on the use of the /8 modifier on the pattern. It
is recognized always. There may be any number of hexadecimal
digits inside the braces. The result is from one to six
bytes, encoded according to the original UTF-8 rules of RFC
2279. This allows for values in the range 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF.
Note that not all of those are valid Unicode code points, or
indeed valid UTF-8 characters according to the later rules
in RFC 3629.</p>

<p>THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</p>

<p>By default, pcretest uses the standard PCRE matching
function, pcre_exec() to match each data line. From release
6.0, PCRE supports an alternative matching function,
pcre_dfa_test(), which operates in a different way, and has
some restrictions. The differences between the two functions
are described in the pcrematching documentation.</p>

<p>If a data line contains the sequence, or if the command
line contains the -dfa option, the alternative matching
function is called. This function finds all possible matches
at a given point. If, however, the escape sequence is
present in the data line, it stops after the first match is
found. This is always the shortest possible match.</p>

<p>DEFAULT OUTPUT FROM PCRETEST</p>

<p>This section describes the output when the normal
matching function, pcre_exec(), is being used.</p>

<p>When a match succeeds, pcretest outputs the list of
captured substrings that pcre_exec() returns, starting with
number 0 for the string that matched the whole pattern.
Otherwise, it outputs &quot;No match&quot; when the return
is PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH, and &quot;Partial match:&quot;
followed by the par- tially matching substring when
pcre_exec() returns PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL. For any other
return, pcretest outputs the PCRE negative error number and
a short descriptive phrase. If the error is a failed UTF-8
string check, the byte offset of the start of the failing
character and the reason code are also output, provided that
the size of the output vec- tor is at least two. Here is an
example of an interactive pcretest run.</p>

<p>$ pcretest PCRE version 7.0 30-Nov-2006</p>

<p>re&gt; /^abc(+)/ data&gt; abc123 0: abc123 1: 123
data&gt; xyz No match</p>

<p>Unset capturing substrings that are not followed by one
that is set are not returned by pcre_exec(), and are not
shown by pcretest. In the fol- lowing example, there are two
capturing substrings, but when the first data line is
matched, the second, unset substring is not shown. An
&quot;internal&quot; unset substring is shown as
&quot;&lt;unset&gt;&quot;, as for the second data line.</p>

<p>re&gt; /(a)|(b)/ data&gt; a 0: a 1: a data&gt; b 0: b 1:
&lt;unset&gt; 2: b</p>

<p>If the strings contain any non-printing characters, they
are output as x escapes, or as .} escapes if the /8 modifier
was present on the pattern. See below for the definition of
non-printing characters. If the pattern has the /+ modifier,
the output for substring 0 is fol- lowed by the the rest of
the subject string, identified by &quot;0+&quot; like
this:</p>

<p>re&gt; /cat/+ data&gt; cataract 0: cat 0+ aract</p>

<p>If the pattern has the /g or /G modifier, the results of
successive matching attempts are output in sequence, like
this:</p>

<p>re&gt; /0ssissippi 0: iss 1: ss 0: iss 1: ss 0: ipp 1:
pp</p>

<p>&quot;No match&quot; is output only if the first match
attempt fails. Here is an example of a failure message (the
offset 4 that is specified by &gt;4 is past the end of the
subject string):</p>

<p>re&gt; /xyz/ data&gt; xyz&gt;4 Error -24 (bad offset
value)</p>

<p>If any of the sequenceG, or are present in a data line
that is successfully matched, the substrings extracted by
the convenience functions are output with C, G, or L after
the string number instead of a colon. This is in addition to
the normal full list. The string length (that is, the return
from the extraction function) is given in paren- theses
after each string forandG.</p>

<p>Note that whereas patterns can be continued over several
lines (a plain &quot;&gt;&quot; prompt is used for
continuations), data lines may not. However new- lines can
be included in data by means of the escape (or 0 , etc.,
depending on the newline sequence setting).</p>

<p>OUTPUT FROM THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</p>

<p>When the alternative matching function, pcre_dfa_exec(),
is used (by means of the sequence or the -dfa command line
option), the output consists of a list of all the matches
that start at the first point in the subject where there is
at least one match. For example:</p>

<p>re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/ data&gt; yellow tangerine
1: tang 2: tan</p>

<p>(Using the normal matching function on this data finds
only &quot;tang&quot;.) The longest matching string is
always given first (and numbered zero).</p>

<p>If /g is present on the pattern, the search for further
matches resumes at the end of the longest match. For
example:</p>

<p>re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/g data&gt; yellow tangerine
and tangy sultana 1: tang 2: tan 0: tang 1: tan 0: tan</p>

<p>Since the matching function does not support substring
capture, the escape sequences that are concerned with
captured substrings are not relevant.</p>

<p>RESTARTING AFTER A PARTIAL MATCH</p>

<p>When the alternative matching function has given the
PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL return, indicating that the subject
partially matched the pattern, you can restart the match
with additional subject data by means of the escape
sequence. For example:</p>

<p>re&gt;
/^?(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)$/
data&gt; 23jaP data&gt; n05 For further information about
partial matching, see the pcrepartial documentation.</p>

<p>CALLOUTS</p>

<p>If the pattern contains any callout requests, pcretests
callout func- tion is called during matching. This works
with both matching functions. By default, the called
function displays the callout number, the start and current
positions in the text at the callout time, and the next
pattern item to be tested. For example, the output</p>

<p>---&gt;pqrabcdef 0 ^ ^</p>

<p>indicates that callout number 0 occurred for a match
attempt starting at the fourth character of the subject
string, when the pointer was at the seventh character of the
data, and when the next pattern item was . Just one
circumflex is output if the start and current positions are
the same.</p>

<p>Callouts numbered 255 are assumed to be automatic
callouts, inserted as a result of the /C pattern modifier.
In this case, instead of showing the callout number, the
offset in the pattern, preceded by a plus, is output. For
example:</p>

<p>re&gt; /?[A-E]C data&gt; E* ---&gt;E* +0 ^ ? +3 ^ [A-E]
+8 ^^ +10 ^ ^ 0: E*</p>

<p>The callout function in pcretest returns zero (carry on
matching) by default, but you can use a in a data line (as
described above) to change this.</p>

<p>Inserting callouts can be helpful when using pcretest to
check compli- cated regular expressions. For further
information about callouts, see the pcrecallout
documentation.</p>

<p>NON-PRINTING CHARACTERS</p>

<p>When pcretest is outputting text in the compiled version
of a pattern, bytes other than 32-126 are always treated as
non-printing characters are are therefore shown as hex
escapes.</p>

<p>When pcretest is outputting text that is a matched part
of a subject string, it behaves in the same way, unless a
different locale has been set for the pattern (using the /L
modifier). In this case, the isprint() function to
distinguish printing and non-printing characters.</p>

<p>SAVING AND RELOADING COMPILED PATTERNS</p>

<p>The facilities described in this section are not
available when the POSIX interface to PCRE is being used,
that is, when the /P pattern modifier is specified.</p>

<p>When the POSIX interface is not in use, you can cause
pcretest to write a compiled pattern to a file, by following
the modifiers with &gt; and a file name. For example:</p>

<p>/pattern/im &gt;/some/file</p>

<p>See the pcreprecompile documentation for a discussion
about saving and re-using compiled patterns.</p>

<p>The data that is written is binary. The first eight
bytes are the length of the compiled pattern data followed
by the length of the optional study data, each written as
four bytes in big-endian order (most significant byte
first). If there is no study data (either the pattern was
not studied, or studying did not return any data), the sec-
ond length is zero. The lengths are followed by an exact
copy of the compiled pattern. If there is additional study
data, this follows imme- diately after the compiled pattern.
After writing the file, pcretest expects to read a new
pattern.</p>

<p>A saved pattern can be reloaded into pcretest by
specifying &lt; and a file name instead of a pattern. The
name of the file must not contain a &lt; character, as
otherwise pcretest will interpret the line as a pattern
delimited by &lt; characters. For example:</p>

<p>re&gt; &lt;/some/file Compiled regex loaded from
/some/file No study data</p>

<p>When the pattern has been loaded, pcretest proceeds to
read data lines in the usual way.</p>

<p>You can copy a file written by pcretest to a different
host and reload it there, even if the new host has opposite
endianness to the one on which the pattern was compiled. For
example, you can compile on an i86 machine and run on a
SPARC machine.</p>

<p>File names for saving and reloading can be absolute or
relative, but note that the shell facility of expanding a
file name that starts with a tilde (~) is not available.</p>

<p>The ability to save and reload files in pcretest is
intended for test- ing and experimentation. It is not
intended for production use because only a single pattern
can be written to a file. Furthermore, there is no facility
for supplying custom character tables for use with a
reloaded pattern. If the original pattern was compiled with
custom tables, an attempt to match a subject string using a
reloaded pattern is likely to cause pcretest to crash.
Finally, if you attempt to load a file that is not in the
correct format, the result is undefined.</p>
