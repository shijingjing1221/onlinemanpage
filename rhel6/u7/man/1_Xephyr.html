<p>NAME Xephyr - X server outputting to a window on a
pre-existing X display</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Xephyr [:display] [option ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xephyr is a kdrive server that outputs to a
window on a pre-existing &quot;host&quot; X display. Think
Xnest but with support for modern extensions like composite,
damage and randr.</p>

<p>Unlike Xnest which is an X proxy, i.e. limited to the
capabilities of the host X server, Xephyr is a real X server
which uses the host X server window as
&quot;framebuffer&quot; via fast SHM XImages.</p>

<p>It also has support for &quot;visually&quot; debugging
what the server is paint- ing.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The server accepts all the standard options of
Xserver(1) and the fol- lowing additional options:</p>

<p>-screen widthxheight sets the screen size.</p>

<p>-parent id uses existing window id . If a -screen
argument follows a -parent argument, this screen is embedded
into the given win- dow.</p>

<p>-host-cursor set cursor acceleration : The hosts cursor
is reused. This is only really there to aid debugging by
avoiding server paints for the cursor. Performance
improvement is negligible.</p>

<p>-resizeable Allow the Xephyr window to be resized, even
if not embedded into a parent window. By default, the Xephyr
window has a fixed size.</p>

<p>SIGNALS Send a SIGUSR1 to the server (e.g. pkill -USR1
Xephyr) to toggle the debugging mode. In this mode red
rectangles are painted to screen areas getting painted
before painting the actual content. The delay between this
can be altered by setting a XEPHYR_PAUSE env var to a value
in micro seconds.</p>

<p>CAVEATS &middot; Rotated displays are currently updated
via full blits. This is slower than a normal orientated
display. Debug mode will therefore not be of much use
rotated.</p>

<p>&middot; The -host-cursor cursor is static in its
appearance.</p>

<p>&middot; The build gets a warning about nanosleep. I
think the various -D build flags are causing this. I havent
figured as yet how to work round it. It doesnt appear to
break anything however.</p>

<p>&middot; Keyboard handling is basic but works.</p>

<p>&middot; Mouse button 5 probably wont work.</p>
