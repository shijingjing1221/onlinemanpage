<p>NAME pccardctl - PCMCIA card control utility lspcmcia -
display extended PCMCIA debugging information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pccardctl [-V] [-v ...] command [socket]
lspcmcia [-V] [-v ...] [socket]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pccardctl is used to monitor and control the
state of PCMCIA sockets. If a socket number is specified,
the command will be applied to just one socket; otherwise,
all sockets will be affected.</p>

<p>If pccardctl is executed by root, all commands are
available. If it is executed by an unpriviledged user, only
the informational commands are accessible.</p>

<p>lspcmcia is an alias for pccardctl ls, provided for
convenience.</p>

<p>COMMANDS status Display the current socket status
flags.</p>

<p>config Display the socket configuration, including power
settings, inter- rupt and I/O window settings, and
configuration registers. --not yet implemented</p>

<p>ident Display card identification information, including
product identi- fication strings, manufacturer ID codes, and
function ID codes. Not yet implemented for cardbus cards.
Use lspci instead.</p>

<p>info Much like the ident command, but its output is
formatted as a series of Bourne-stype shell variable
definitions for use in scripts. Not yet implemented for
cardbus cards.</p>

<p>ls Display extended debugging information about the
PCMCIA sockets and devices present in the system.</p>

<p>suspend Shut down and then disable power for a
socket.</p>

<p>resume Restore power to a socket, and re-configure for
use.</p>

<p>eject Notify all client drivers that this card will be
ejected, then cut power to the socket.</p>

<p>insert Notify all client drivers that this card has just
been inserted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V Show version information and exit.</p>

<p>-v Increase the verbosity of the ls command. Giving this
option twice increases verbosity further.</p>
