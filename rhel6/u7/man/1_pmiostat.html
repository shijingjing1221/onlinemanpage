<p>PMIOSTAT(1) PMIOSTAT(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmiostat - performance metrics value dumper</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmiostat [-A align --align=TIME] [-a archive
--archive=FILE] [-h host --host=HOST] [-O offset
--origin=TIME] [-S starttime --start=TIME] [-s samples
--samples=N] [-T endtime --finish=TIME] [-t interval
--inter- val=DELTA] [-Z timezone --timezone=TZ] [-z
--hostzone] [-? --help] [-x [dm][,t][,h]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmiostat reports I/O statistics for scsi
devices (by default) or device-mapper devices (if the -x dm
option is specified). By default pmiostat reports live data
for the local host but can also report for a remote host
(-h) or from a previously captured PCP archive (-a).</p>

<p>The -S, -T, -O and -A options may be used to define a
time window to restrict the samples retrieved, set an
initial origin within the time window, or specify a natural
alignment of the sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of these options.</p>

<p>The other options which control the source, timing and
layout of the information reported by pmiostat are as
follows:</p>

<p>-a Performance metric values are retrieved from the
Performance Co- Pilot (PCP) archive log file identified by
the base name archive.</p>

<p>-h Current performance metric values are retrieved from
the nominated host machine.</p>

<p>-s The argument samples defines the number of samples to
be retrieved and reported. If samples is 0 or -s is not
specified, pmiostat will sample and report continuously (in
real time mode) or until the end of the PCP archive (in
archive mode).</p>

<p>-t The default update interval may be set to something
other than the default 1 second. The interval argument
follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1), and in the
simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units
in this case are seconds). The -t option is particularly
useful when replaying large archives (-a option) that span
several hours or even days. In this case specifying a large
interval (e.g. 1h for 1 hour) will reduce the volume of data
reported and the i/o statistics will be averaged
(interpolated) over the reporting interval.</p>

<p>-Z By default, pmiostat reports the time of day
according to the local timezone on the system where pmiostat
is run. The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in
the format of the environment variable TZ as described in
environ(5).</p>

<p>-z Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone
at the host that is the source of the performance metrics,
as identified via either the -h or -a options.</p>

<p>-x Specifies a comma separated list of one or more
extended reporting options as follows: dm - report
statistics for device-mapper logical devices instead of scsi
devices, t - prefix every line in the report with a
timestamp in ctime(3) format, H - omit the heading, which is
otherwise reported every 24 sam- ples.</p>

<p>REPORT The columns in the pmiostat report have the
following interpretation :</p>

<p>Timestamp When the -x t option is specified, this column
is the timestamp in ctime(3) format.</p>

<p>Device Specifies the scsi device name, or if -x dm is
specified, the device-mapper logical device name.</p>

<p>rrqm/s The number of read requests expressed as a rate
per-second that were merged during the reporting interval by
the I/O scheduler.</p>

<p>wrqm/s The number of write requests expressed as a rate
per-second that were merged during the reporting interval by
the I/O scheduler.</p>

<p>r/s The number of read requests completed by the device
(after merges), expressed as a rate per second during the
reporting interval.</p>

<p>w/s The number of write requests completed by the device
(after merges), expressed as a rate per second during the
reporting interval.</p>

<p>rkB/s The average volume of data read from the device
expressed as KBytes/second during the reporting
interval.</p>

<p>wkB/s The average volume of data written to the device
expressed as KBytes/second during the reporting
interval.</p>

<p>avgrq-sz The average I/O request size for both reads and
writes to the device expressed as Kbytes during the
reporting interval.</p>

<p>avgqu-sz The average queue length of read and write
requests to the device during the reporting interval.</p>

<p>await The average time in milliseconds that read and
write requests were queued (and serviced) to the device
during the reporting interval.</p>

<p>r_await The average time in milliseconds that read
requests were queued (and serviced) to the device during the
reporting interval.</p>

<p>w_await The average time in milliseconds that write
requests were queued (and serviced) to the device during the
reporting interval.</p>

<p>%util The percentage of time during the reporting
interval that the device was busy processing requests. A
value of 100% indicates device saturation.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* default PMNS specification
files</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All are generated on standard error and are
intended to be self- explanatory.</p>
