<p>NAME pamtouil - convert a PNM or PNM/alpha image into a
Motif UIL icon file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtouil [-name=uilname] [pamfile]</p>

<p>You may abbreviate any option to its shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to delimit an
option. You may separate an option from its value with
whitespace instead of =.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtouil reads a PNM or PAM image as input and produces
a Motif UIL icon file as output. If the input is PAM, it may
be either a regular grayscale or color image or
grayscale+alpha or color+alpha. Where the alpha channel is
present, pamtouil renders pixels that are more than half
transparent as transparent in the output.</p>

<p>In the UILs colormap, pamtouil uses the color names from
the RGB database -- the same one ppmmake(1) uses. Where a
color in the input does not exactly match one of the colors
named in the RGB database, pamtouil uses the closest color
named in the RGB database.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -name Allows you to specify the prefix string
which is printed in the resulting UIL output. If not
specified, will default to the filename (without extension)
of the ppmfile argument. If -name is not specified and no
ppmfile is specified (i.e. piped input), the prefix string
will default to the string noname.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pam(1) pam(1) ppm(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY Before May 2002, pamtouil was called ppmtouil
and had no way to specify transparency.</p>
