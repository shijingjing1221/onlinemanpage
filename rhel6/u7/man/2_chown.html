<p>CHOWN(2) Linux Programmer s Manual CHOWN(2)</p>

<p>NAME chown, fchown, lchown - change ownership of a
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int chown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
int fchown(int fd, uid_t owner, gid_t group); int
lchown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>fchown(), lchown(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;=
500</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These system calls change the owner and
group of a file. The differ only in how the file is
specified:</p>

<p>* chown() changes the ownership of the file specified by
path, which is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.</p>

<p>* fchown() changes the ownership of the file referred to
by the open file descriptor fd.</p>

<p>* lchown() is like chown(), but does not dereference
symbolic links.</p>

<p>Only a privileged process (Linux: one with the CAP_CHOWN
capability) may change the owner of a file. The owner of a
file may change the group of the file to any group of which
that owner is a member. A privileged process (Linux: with
CAP_CHOWN) may change the group arbi- trarily.</p>

<p>If the owner or group is specified as -1, then that ID
is not changed.</p>

<p>When the owner or group of an executable file are
changed by a non- superuser, the S_ISUID and S_ISGID mode
bits are cleared. POSIX does not specify whether this also
should happen when root does the chown(); the Linux behavior
depends on the kernel version. In case of a non-
group-executable file (i.e., one for which the S_IXGRP bit
is not set) the S_ISGID bit indicates mandatory locking, and
is not cleared by a chown().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS Depending on the file system, other errors can be
returned. The more general errors for chown() are listed
below.</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix. (See also path_resolution(7).)</p>

<p>EFAULT path points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving path.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG path is too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT The file does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process did not have the required
permissions (see above) to change owner and/or group.</p>

<p>EROFS The named file resides on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>The general errors for fchown() are listed below:</p>

<p>EBADF The descriptor is not valid.</p>

<p>EIO A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the
inode.</p>

<p>ENOENT See above.</p>

<p>EPERM See above.</p>

<p>EROFS See above.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.4BSD, SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>The 4.4BSD version can only be used by the superuser
(that is, ordinary users cannot give away files).</p>

<p>NOTES When a new file is created (by, for example,
open(2) or mkdir(2)), its owner is made the same as the file
system user ID of the creating pro- cess. The group of the
file depends on a range of factors, including the type of
file system, the options used to mount the file system, and
whether or not the set-group-ID permission bit is enabled on
the parent directory. If the file system supports the -o
grpid (or, synonymously -o bsdgroups) and -o nogrpid (or,
synonymously -o sysvgroups) mount(8) options, then the rules
are as follows:</p>

<p>* If the file system is mounted with -o grpid, then the
group of a new file is made the same as that of the parent
directory.</p>

<p>* If the file system is mounted with -o nogrpid and the
set-group-ID bit is disabled on the parent directory, then
the group of a new file is made the same as the processs
file system GID.</p>

<p>* If the file system is mounted with -o nogrpid and the
set-group-ID bit is enabled on the parent directory, then
the group of a new file is made the same as that of the
parent directory.</p>

<p>As at Linux 2.6.25, the -o grpid and -o nogrpid mount
options are sup- ported by ext2, ext3, ext4, and XFS. File
systems that dont support these mount options follow the -o
nogrpid rules.</p>

<p>The chown() semantics are deliberately violated on NFS
file systems which have UID mapping enabled. Additionally,
the semantics of all system calls which access the file
contents are violated, because chown() may cause immediate
access revocation on already open files. Client side caching
may lead to a delay between the time where owner- ship have
been changed to allow access for a user and the time where
the file can actually be accessed by the user on other
clients.</p>

<p>In versions of Linux prior to 2.1.81 (and distinct from
2.1.46), chown() did not follow symbolic links. Since Linux
2.1.81, chown() does follow symbolic links, and there is a
new system call lchown() that does not follow symbolic
links. Since Linux 2.1.86, this new call (that has the same
semantics as the old chown()) has got the same syscall
number, and chown() got the newly introduced number.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program changes the ownership of
the file named in its second command-line argument to the
value specified in its first com- mand-line argument. The
new owner can be specified either as a numeric user ID, or
as a username (which is converted to a user ID by using
getpwnam(3) to perform a lookup in the system password
file).</p>

<p>#include &lt;pwd.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { uid_t uid; struct
passwd *pwd; char *endptr;</p>

<p>if (argc != 3 || argv[1][0] == &rsquo; &rsquo;) {
fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s &lt;owner&gt; &lt;file&gt;0,
argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>uid = strtol(argv[1], &amp;endptr, 10); /* Allow a
numeric string */</p>

<p>if (*endptr != &rsquo; &rsquo;) { /* Was not pure
numeric string */ pwd = getpwnam(argv[1]); /* Try getting
UID for username */ if (pwd == NULL) {
perror(&quot;getpwnam&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>uid = pwd-&gt;pw_uid; }</p>

<p>if (chown(argv[2], uid, -1) == -1) {
perror(&quot;chown&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } /* if
*/</p>

<p>exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); } /* main */</p>
