<p>NAME htdig - retrieve HTML documents for ht://Dig search
engine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htdig [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the
HTTP protocol and gathers information from these documents
which can later be used to search these documents. This
program can be referred to as the search robot.</p>

<p>OPTIONS - Get the list of URLs to start indexing from
standard input. This will override the default parameter
start_url specified in the config file and the file supplied
to the -m option.</p>

<p>-a Use alternate work files. Tells htdig to append .work
to database files, causing a second copy of the database to
be built. This allows the original files to be used by
htsearch during the indexing run.</p>

<p>-c configfile Use the specified configfile instead of
the default.</p>

<p>-h maxhops Restrict the dig to documents that are at
most maxhops links away from the starting document. This
only works if option -i is also given.</p>

<p>-i Initial. Do not use any old databases. Old databases
will be erased before runing the program.</p>

<p>-m filename Minimal run. Only index the URLs given in
the file filename, ignoring all others. URLs in the file
should be formatted one URL per line. -s Print statistics
about the dig after comple- tion.</p>

<p>-t Create an ASCII version of the document database.
This database is easy to parse with other programs so that
information can be extracted from it for purposes other than
searching. One could gather some interesting statistics from
this database.</p>

<p>Fieldname Value u URL t Title a State (0 normal, 1 not
found, 2 not indexed, 3 obsolete) m Time of last
modification reported by the server s Document Size in bytes
H Excerpt of the document h Meta Description l Time of last
rerievial L Count of links in the document or of outgoing
links b Number of links to the document, also called
incoming links or backlinks c Hop count of this document g
Signature of this document (used to detect duplicates) e
E-Mail address to use for a notification from htnotify n
Date on which such notification is sent</p>

<p>S Subject of the notfication message d The text of
Incoming links pointing to this document (e.g. &lt;a
href=&quot;docURL&quot;&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;) A Anchors
in the document (i.e. &lt;A NAME=...)</p>

<p>-u username:password Tells htdig to send the supplied
username and password with each HTTP request. The
credentials will be encoded using the &acute;Basic&acute;
authentication method. There HAS to be a colon (:) between
the username and password.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. This increases the verbosity of the
program. Using more than 2 is probably only useful for
debugging purposes. The default verbose mode (using only one
-v) gives a nice progress report while digging. Please
consult the section below on the exact format of the
progress report.</p>

<p>FORMAT OF THE PROGRESS REPORT GIVEN IN VERBOSE MODE A
line is shown for each URL, with 3 numbers before the URL
and some symbols after the URL. The first number is the
number of documents parsed so far, the second is the DocID
for this docu- ment, and the third is the hop count of the
document (number of hops from one of the start_url
documents). Signification of the sybols printed after the
url:</p>

<p>&quot;*&quot; is printed for a link already visited</p>

<p>&quot;+&quot; is printed for a new link just queued</p>

<p>&quot;-&quot; is output for a link rejected for any of a
number of rea- sons. To find out what those reasons are, you
need to run htdig with at least 3 -v options, i.e. -vvv.</p>

<p>If there are no &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot; or
&quot;-&quot; symbols after the URL, it doesnt mean the
document was not parsed or was empty, but only that no links
to other documents were found within it. With more verbose
output, these symbols will get interspersed in several lines
of debugging output.</p>

<p>FILES</p>

<p>/etc/htdig/htdig.conf The default configuration file.
/var/lib/htdig/db.docdb Stores data about each document
(title, url, etc.). /var/lib/htdig/db.words.db,
/var/lib/htdig/db.words.db_weakcmpr Record which documents
each word occurs in. /var/lib/htdig/db.excerpts Stores start
of each document to show context of matches.</p>
