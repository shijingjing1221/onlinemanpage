<p>RM(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RM(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME rm - remove directory entries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rm [-fiRr] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rm utility shall remove the directory
entry specified by each file argument.</p>

<p>If either of the files dot or dot-dot are specified as
the basename portion of an operand (that is, the final
pathname component), rm shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error and do nothing more with such operands.</p>

<p>For each file the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<p>1. If the file does not exist:</p>

<p>a. If the -f option is not specified, rm shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error.</p>

<p>b. Go on to any remaining files.</p>

<p>2. If file is of type directory, the following steps
shall be taken:</p>

<p>a. If neither the -R option nor the -r option is
specified, rm shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with file, and go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p>b. If the -f option is not specified, and either the
permissions of file do not permit writing and the standard
input is a ter- minal or the -i option is specified, rm
shall write a prompt to standard error and read a line from
the standard input. If the response is not affirmative, rm
shall do nothing more with the current file and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p>c. For each entry contained in file, other than dot or
dot-dot, the four steps listed here (1 to 4) shall be taken
with the entry as if it were a file operand. The rm utility
shall not traverse directories by following symbolic links
into other parts of the hierarchy, but shall remove the
links themselves.</p>

<p>d. If the -i option is specified, rm shall write a
prompt to stan- dard error and read a line from the standard
input. If the response is not affirmative, rm shall do
nothing more with the current file, and go on to any
remaining files.</p>

<p>3. If file is not of type directory, the -f option is
not specified, and either the permissions of file do not
permit writing and the standard input is a terminal or the
-i option is specified, rm shall write a prompt to the
standard error and read a line from the standard input. If
the response is not affirmative, rm shall do nothing more
with the current file and go on to any remaining files.</p>

<p>4. If the current file is a directory, rm shall perform
actions equiv- alent to the rmdir() function defined in the
System Interfaces vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 called
with a pathname of the current file used as the path
argument. If the current file is not a direc- tory, rm shall
perform actions equivalent to the unlink() function defined
in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
called with a pathname of the current file used as the path
argu- ment.</p>

<p>If this fails for any reason, rm shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with
the current file, and go on to any remaining files.</p>

<p>The rm utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary
depths in a file hierarchy, and shall not fail due to path
length limitations (unless an operand specified by the user
exceeds system limitations).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The rm utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-f Do not prompt for confirmation. Do not write
diagnostic messages or modify the exit status in the case of
nonexistent operands. Any previous occurrences of the -i
option shall be ignored.</p>

<p>-i Prompt for confirmation as described previously. Any
previous occurrences of the -f option shall be ignored.</p>

<p>-R Remove file hierarchies. See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>-r Equivalent to -R.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a directory entry to be removed.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used to read an input
line in response to each prompt specified in the STDOUT
section. Otherwise, the standard input shall not be
used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of rm:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
used in the extended regular expression defined for the
yesexpr locale key- word in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments) and the behavior of character classes within
regular expressions used in the extended regular expression
defined for the yesexpr locale key- word in the LC_MESSAGES
category.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale for the processing of
affirmative responses that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diag- nostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR Prompts shall be written to standard error under
the conditions speci- fied in the DESCRIPTION and OPTIONS
sections. The prompts shall contain the file pathname, but
their format is otherwise unspecified. The stan- dard error
also shall be used for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All of the named directory entries for which rm
performed actions equivalent to the rmdir() or unlink()
functions were removed.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The rm utility is forbidden to remove
the names dot and dot-dot in order to avoid the consequences
of inadvertently doing something like:</p>

<p>rm -r .*</p>

<p>Some implementations do not permit the removal of the
last link to an executable binary file that is being
executed; see the [EBUSY] error in the unlink() function
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Thus, the rm utility can fail to remove such
files.</p>

<p>The -i option causes rm to prompt and read the standard
input even if the standard input is not a terminal, but in
the absence of -i the mode prompting is not done when the
standard input is not a terminal.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following command:</p>

<p>rm a.out core</p>

<p>removes the directory entries: a.out and core.</p>

<p>2. The following command:</p>

<p>rm -Rf junk</p>

<p>removes the directory junk and all its contents, without
prompting.</p>

<p>RATIONALE For absolute clarity, paragraphs (2b) and (3)
in the DESCRIPTION of rm describing the behavior when
prompting for confirmation, should be interpreted in the
following manner:</p>

<p>if ((NOT f_option) AND ((not_writable AND
input_is_terminal) OR i_option))</p>

<p>The exact format of the interactive prompts is
unspecified. Only the general nature of the contents of
prompts are specified because imple- mentations may desire
more descriptive prompts than those used on his- torical
implementations. Therefore, an application not using the -f
option, or using the -i option, relies on the system to
provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user,
based on the behavior specified.</p>

<p>The -r option is historical practice on all known
systems. The synonym -R option is provided for consistency
with the other utilities in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 that provide options requesting recur- sive
descent through the file hierarchy.</p>

<p>The behavior of the -f option in historical versions of
rm is inconsis- tent. In general, along with
&quot;forcing&quot; the unlink without prompting for
permission, it always causes diagnostic messages to be
suppressed and the exit status to be unmodified for
nonexistent operands and files that cannot be unlinked. In
some versions, however, the -f option sup- presses usage
messages and system errors as well. Suppressing such mes-
sages is not a service to either shell scripts or users.</p>

<p>It is less clear that error messages regarding files
that cannot be unlinked (removed) should be suppressed.
Although this is historical practice, this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does not permit the -f option to suppress
such messages.</p>

<p>When given the -r and -i options, historical versions of
rm prompt the user twice for each directory, once before
removing its contents and once before actually attempting to
delete the directory entry that names it. This allows the
user to &quot;prune&quot; the file hierarchy walk. His-
torical versions of rm were inconsistent in that some did
not do the former prompt for directories named on the
command line and others had obscure prompting behavior when
the -i option was specified and the permissions of the file
did not permit writing. The POSIX Shell and Utilities rm
differs little from historic practice, but does require that
prompts be consistent. Historical versions of rm were also
incon- sistent in that prompts were done to both standard
output and standard error. This volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 requires that prompts be done to standard error,
for consistency with cp and mv, and to allow historical
extensions to rm that provide an option to list deleted
files on standard output.</p>

<p>The rm utility is required to descend to arbitrary
depths so that any file hierarchy may be deleted. This
means, for example, that the rm utility cannot run out of
file descriptors during its descent (that is, if the number
of file descriptors is limited, rm cannot be implemented in
the historical fashion where one file descriptor is used per
direc- tory level). Also, rm is not permitted to fail
because of path length restrictions, unless an operand
specified by the user is longer than {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The rm utility removes symbolic links themselves, not
the files they refer to, as a consequence of the dependence
on the unlink() function- ality, per the DESCRIPTION. When
removing hierarchies with -r or -R, the prohibition on
following symbolic links has to be made explicit.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
