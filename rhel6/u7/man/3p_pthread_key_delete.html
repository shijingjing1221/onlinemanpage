<p>PTHREAD_KEY_DELETE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_KEY_DELETE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_key_delete - thread-specific data key
deletion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_key_delete(pthread_key_t key);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_key_delete() function shall
delete a thread-specific data key previously returned by
pthread_key_create(). The thread-specific data values
associated with key need not be NULL at the time
pthread_key_delete() is called. It is the responsibility of
the appli- cation to free any application storage or perform
any cleanup actions for data structures related to the
deleted key or associated thread- specific data in any
threads; this cleanup can be done either before or after
pthread_key_delete() is called. Any attempt to use key
following the call to pthread_key_delete() results in
undefined behavior.</p>

<p>The pthread_key_delete() function shall be callable from
within destructor functions. No destructor functions shall
be invoked by pthread_key_delete(). Any destructor function
that may have been asso- ciated with key shall no longer be
called upon thread exit.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_key_delete()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_key_delete() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The key value is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_key_delete() function shall not return an
error code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE A thread-specific data key deletion function
has been included in order to allow the resources associated
with an unused thread-specific data key to be freed. Unused
thread-specific data keys can arise, among other scenarios,
when a dynamically loaded module that allocated a key is
unloaded.</p>

<p>Conforming applications are responsible for performing
any cleanup actions needed for data structures associated
with the key to be deleted, including data referenced by
thread-specific data values. No such cleanup is done by
pthread_key_delete(). In particular, destructor functions
are not called. There are several reasons for this division
of responsibility:</p>

<p>1. The associated destructor functions used to free
thread-specific data at thread exit time are only guaranteed
to work correctly when called in the thread that allocated
the thread-specific data. (Destructors themselves may
utilize thread-specific data.) Thus, they cannot be used to
free thread-specific data in other threads at key deletion
time. Attempting to have them called by other threads at key
deletion time would require other threads to be
asynchronously interrupted. But since interrupted threads
could be in an arbitrary state, including holding locks
necessary for the destructor to run, this approach would
fail. In general, there is no safe mechanism whereby an
implementation could free thread-spe- cific data at key
deletion time.</p>

<p>2. Even if there were a means of safely freeing
thread-specific data associated with keys to be deleted,
doing so would require that implementations be able to
enumerate the threads with non-NULL data and potentially
keep them from creating more thread-specific data while the
key deletion is occurring. This special case could cause
extra synchronization in the normal case, which would
otherwise be unnecessary.</p>

<p>For an application to know that it is safe to delete a
key, it has to know that all the threads that might
potentially ever use the key do not attempt to use it again.
For example, it could know this if all the client threads
have called a cleanup procedure declaring that they are
through with the module that is being shut down, perhaps by
setting a reference count to zero.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
