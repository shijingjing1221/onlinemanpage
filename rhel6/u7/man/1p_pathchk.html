<p>PATHCHK(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PATHCHK(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pathchk - check pathnames</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pathchk [-p] pathname...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pathchk utility shall check that one or
more pathnames are valid (that is, they could be used to
access or create a file without causing syntax errors) and
portable (that is, no filename truncation results). More
extensive portability checks are provided by the -p
option.</p>

<p>By default, the pathchk utility shall check each
component of each pathname operand based on the underlying
file system. A diagnostic shall be written for each pathname
operand that:</p>

<p>* Is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (see Pathname Variable
Values in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 13, Head- ers, &lt;limits.h&gt;)</p>

<p>* Contains any component longer than {NAME_MAX} bytes in
its contain- ing directory</p>

<p>* Contains any component in a directory that is not
searchable</p>

<p>* Contains any character in any component that is not
valid in its containing directory</p>

<p>The format of the diagnostic message is not specified,
but shall indi- cate the error detected and the
corresponding pathname operand.</p>

<p>It shall not be considered an error if one or more
components of a pathname operand do not exist as long as a
file matching the pathname specified by the missing
components could be created that does not vio- late any of
the checks specified above.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The pathchk utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-p Instead of performing checks based on the underlying
file sys- tem, write a diagnostic for each pathname operand
that:</p>

<p>* Is longer than {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} bytes (see Minimum
Values in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 13, Headers, &lt;limits.h&gt;)</p>

<p>* Contains any component longer than {_POSIX_NAME_MAX}
bytes</p>

<p>* Contains any character in any component that is not in
the portable filename character set</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>pathname A pathname to be checked.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of pathchk:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All pathname operands passed all of the checks.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The test utility can be used to
determine whether a given pathname names an existing file;
it does not, however, give any indication of whether or not
any component of the pathname was truncated in a direc- tory
where the _POSIX_NO_TRUNC feature is not in effect. The
pathchk utility does not check for file existence; it
performs checks to deter- mine whether a pathname does exist
or could be created with no pathname component
truncation.</p>

<p>The noclobber option in the shell (see the set special
built-in) can be used to atomically create a file. As with
all file creation semantics in the System Interfaces volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, it guarantees atomic creation, but
still depends on applications to agree on conven- tions and
cooperate on the use of files after they have been
created.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To verify that all pathnames in an imported
data interchange archive are legitimate and unambiguous on
the current system:</p>

<p>pax -f archive | sed -e/ == .*/s///| xargs pathchk if [
$? -eq 0 ] then pax -r -f archive else echo Investigate
problems before importing files. exit 1 fi</p>

<p>To verify that all files in the current directory
hierarchy could be moved to any system conforming to the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 that also
supports the pax utility:</p>

<p>find . -print | xargs pathchk -p if [ $? -eq 0 ] then
pax -w -f archive . else echo Portable archive cannot be
created. exit 1 fi</p>

<p>To verify that a user-supplied pathname names a readable
file and that the application can create a file extending
the given path without truncation and without overwriting
any existing file:</p>

<p>case $- in *C*) reset=&quot;&quot;;; *) reset=&quot;set
+C&quot; set -C;; esac test -r &quot;$path&quot; &amp;&amp;
pathchk &quot;$path.out&quot; &amp;&amp; rm
&quot;$path.out&quot; &gt; &quot;$path.out&quot; if [ $? -ne
0 ]; then printf &quot;%s: %s not found or %s.out fails
creation checksn&quot; $0 &quot;$path&quot;
&quot;$path&quot; $reset # Reset the noclobber option in
case a trap # on EXIT depends on it. exit 1 fi $reset
PROCESSING &lt; &quot;$path&quot; &gt;
&quot;$path.out&quot;</p>

<p>The following assumptions are made in this example:</p>

<p>1. PROCESSING represents the code that is used by the
application to use $path once it is verified that $path.out
works as intended.</p>

<p>2. The state of the noclobber option is unknown when
this code is invoked and should be set on exit to the state
it was in when this code was invoked. (The reset variable is
used in this example to restore the initial state.)</p>

<p>3. Note the usage of:</p>

<p>rm &quot;$path.out&quot; &gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;</p>

<p>a. The pathchk command has already verified, at this
point, that $path.out is not truncated.</p>

<p>b. With the noclobber option set, the shell verifies
that $path.out does not already exist before invoking
rm.</p>

<p>c. If the shell succeeded in creating $path.out, rm
removes it so that the application can create the file again
in the PROCESS- ING step.</p>

<p>d. If the PROCESSING step wants the file to exist
already when it is invoked, the:</p>

<p>rm &quot;$path.out&quot; &gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;</p>

<p>should be replaced with:</p>

<p>&gt; &quot;$path.out&quot;</p>

<p>which verifies that the file did not already exist, but
leaves $path.out in place for use by PROCESSING.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pathchk utility was new for the ISO
POSIX-2:1993 standard. It, along with the set -C( noclobber)
option added to the shell, replaces the mktemp, validfnam,
and create utilities that appeared in early pro- posals. All
of these utilities were attempts to solve several common
problems:</p>

<p>* Verify the validity (for several different definitions
of &quot;valid&quot;) of a pathname supplied by a user,
generated by an application, or imported from an external
source.</p>

<p>* Atomically create a file.</p>

<p>* Perform various string handling functions to generate
a temporary filename.</p>

<p>The create utility, included in an early proposal,
provided checking and atomic creation in a single invocation
of the utility; these are orthogonal issues and need not be
grouped into a single utility. Note that the noclobber
option also provides a way of creating a lock for process
synchronization; since it provides an atomic create, there
is no race between a test for existence and the following
creation if it did not exist.</p>

<p>Having a function like tmpnam() in the ISO C standard is
important in many high-level languages. The shell
programming language, however, has built-in string
manipulation facilities, making it very easy to con- struct
temporary filenames. The names needed obviously depend on
the application, but are frequently of a form similar
to:</p>

<p>$TMPDIR/application_abbreviation$$.suffix</p>

<p>In cases where there is likely to be contention for a
given suffix, a simple shell for or while loop can be used
with the shell noclobber option to create a file without
risk of collisions, as long as applica- tions trying to use
the same filename name space are cooperating on the use of
files after they have been created.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
