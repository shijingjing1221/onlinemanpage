<p>SPI_NEW_DEVICE(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
SPI_NEW_DEVICE(9)</p>

<p>NAME spi_new_device - instantiate one new SPI device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct spi_device * spi_new_device(struct
spi_master * master, struct spi_board_info * chip);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS master Controller to which device is
connected</p>

<p>chip Describes the SPI device</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION On typical mainboards, this is purely
internal; and it&acute;s not needed after board init creates
the hard-wired devices. Some development platforms may not
be able to use spi_register_board_info though, and this is
exported so that for example a USB or parport based adapter
driver could add devices (which it would learn about
out-of-band).</p>

<p>Returns the new device, or NULL.</p>
