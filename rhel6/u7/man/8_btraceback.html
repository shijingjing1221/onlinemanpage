<p>NAME btraceback - wrapper script around gdb and
bsmtp</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS btraceback /path/to/binary pid</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION btraceback is a wrapper shell script around
the gdb debugger (or dbx on Solaris systems) and bsmtp,
provided for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>USAGE btraceback is called by the exception handlers of
the Bacula daemons during a crash. It can also be called
interactively to view the cur- rent state of the threads
belonging to a process, but this is not rec- ommended unless
you are trying to debug a problem (see below).</p>

<p>NOTES In order to work properly, debugging symbols must
be available to the debugger on the system, and gdb, or dbx
(on Solaris systems) must be available in the $PATH.</p>

<p>If the Director or Storage daemon runs under a non-root
uid, you will probably need to be modify the btraceback
script to elevate privileges for the call to gdb/dbx, to
ensure it has the proper permissions to debug when called by
the daemon.</p>

<p>Although Bacula s use of btraceback within its exception
handlers is always safe, manual or interactive use of
btraceback is subject to the same risks than live debugging
of any program, which means it could cause Bacula to crash
under rare and abnormal circumstances. Conse- quently we do
not recommend manual use of btraceback in production
environments unless it is required for debugging a
problem.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT btracback relies on $PATH to find the
debugger.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib/bacula/btraceback The script itself.</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/btraceback symbolic link to
/usr/lib/bacula/btraceback</p>

<p>/etc/bacula/scripts/btraceback.gdb the GDB command batch
used to output a stack trace</p>
