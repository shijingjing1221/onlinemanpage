<p>callback(8) mgetty+callback manual callback(8)</p>

<p>NAME callback - call a user back, presenting a login
prompt</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS callback [-x&lt;debuglevel&gt;] [-V]
[-l&lt;modemlines&gt;] [-m&lt;initstring&gt;]
[-s&lt;speed&gt;] [-d] [-S] [phone-number]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Call the given phone number (if none is
given on the command line, ask user for one), and if a
CONNECT is established, hand over control to mgetty(8) to
present user with a login name prompt.</p>

<p>callback is used for various purposes:</p>

<p>* security: make sure your users are who they pretend to
be by calling a well-known phone number.</p>

<p>* cost savings: make your company call you back.</p>

<p>callback can be called directly from the command line
(but you must be &quot;root&quot; to do this, otherwise
callback can t signal mgetty), or from mgettys
&quot;login.config&quot;. See the login.config file shipped
with mgetty for an example.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -x &lt;debug level&gt; Use the given level of
verbosity for logging - 0 means no logging, 5 is really
noisy.</p>

<p>-V Print version number and quit.</p>

<p>-d Do not go into the background. This is helpful for
debug- ging.</p>

<p>-l &lt;modem lines&gt; Use the given modem lines.
Multiple lines can be sepa- rated by &quot;:&quot;, as with
sendfax(8). Example: callback -l tty1a:tty2a</p>

<p>-m &lt;init sequence&gt; Set the modem initialization
sequence (as usual: expect send expect ...). This can do
nearly everything, as long as it leaves the modem command
responses on (that is, no ATQ1 here!) and switches the modem
to data mode (AT+FCLASS=0) if it is used in data/fax
mode.</p>

<p>-s &lt;speed&gt; This is the bit rate that should be
used for the machine- modem connection. Usually youll set
this via the &quot;speed &lt;nnnn&gt;&quot; option in
&quot;callback.config&quot;.</p>

<p>-S Use the line where callback is started from for
dialing out. Callback can make use of multiple modem lines,
and with this options, you can force it to use just one
modem, the one where a call comes in.</p>

<p>CONFIG FILE callback will read all its configuration at
run-time from a file, usually called
/etc/mgetty+sendfax/callback.config. See the documentation
in the mgetty.info manual for details.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS In most cases, callback cant print any error
messages to the console, because it must detach itself
immediately from the ter- minal, in case someone wants to be
called back on the modem line he called in. So, nothing to
print messages to...</p>

<p>Because of this, all callback errors are logged to a
protocol file (the extent of the data written is controlled
by the &quot;-x&quot; option), especially including the
reason why a call was not made, or what exactly failed.</p>

<p>Just two messages are printed on stdout, and those are
self- explaining, a call from a non-root user, and an
invalid option.</p>

<p>INTERNALS How does it work?</p>

<p>This is a bit tricky, because of the way init(8) handles
the utmp(5) file. You cant just have any program ask the
user for a login name, and then start a &quot;login
shell&quot;, it wont work (this is for the same reason
mgetty(8) has to be started from /etc/inittab).</p>

<p>So, mgetty has to do the &quot;asking for login
name&quot;. But I do not want to have all that dialout code
in mgetty, bloating it even more.</p>

<p>The way it works is this: callback dials out on a modem
device. It will only take a modem device that has a mgetty
watching over it (!). When the connection is established
(CONNECT), callback will send a signal SIGUSR1 to mgetty,
which, in turn, will send the same signal back to signal
&quot;I got your signal&quot;. callback then exits, and
mgetty takes over the existing connection, prompts the user
for a login name, and forks off /bin/login.</p>

<p>Conclusion: this will not work with mgetty versions
before February 04, 1996 (no support for this signalling),
and if it doesn t work for you, please send me BOTH the
mgetty and the callback log file, otherwise its very hard to
find the bugs.</p>

<p>BUGS callback is &quot;alpha&quot; code, not very stable
right now.</p>

<p>callback is fairly dumb concerning retries.</p>

<p>callback must be run as root.</p>

<p>Most of the documentation consists of &quot;reading the
source&quot;.</p>
