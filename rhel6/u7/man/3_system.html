<p>SYSTEM(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SYSTEM(3)</p>

<p>NAME system - execute a shell command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int system(const char *command);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION system() executes a command specified in
command by calling /bin/sh -c command, and returns after the
command has been completed. During exe- cution of the
command, SIGCHLD will be blocked, and SIGINT and SIGQUIT
will be ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The value returned is -1 on error (e.g.
fork(2) failed), and the return status of the command
otherwise. This latter return status is in the format
specified in wait(2). Thus, the exit code of the command
will be WEXITSTATUS(status). In case /bin/sh could not be
executed, the exit status will be that of a command that
does exit(127).</p>

<p>If the value of command is NULL, system() returns
non-zero if the shell is available, and zero if not.</p>

<p>system() does not affect the wait status of any other
children.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES If the _XOPEN_SOURCE feature test macro is
defined, then the macros described in wait(2)
(WEXITSTATUS(), etc.) are made available when including
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>

<p>As mentioned, system() ignores SIGINT and SIGQUIT. This
may make pro- grams that call it from a loop
uninterruptible, unless they take care themselves to check
the exit status of the child. E.g.</p>

<p>while (something) { int ret =
system(&quot;foo&quot;);</p>

<p>if (WIFSIGNALED(ret) &amp;&amp; (WTERMSIG(ret) == SIGINT
|| WTERMSIG(ret) == SIGQUIT)) break; }</p>

<p>Do not use system() from a program with set-user-ID or
set-group-ID privileges, because strange values for some
environment variables might be used to subvert system
integrity. Use the exec(3) family of func- tions instead,
but not execlp(3) or execvp(3). system() will not, in fact,
work properly from programs with set-user-ID or set-group-ID
privileges on systems on which /bin/sh is bash version 2,
since bash 2 drops privileges on startup. (Debian uses a
modified bash which does not do this when invoked as
sh.)</p>

<p>In versions of glibc before 2.1.3, the check for the
availability of /bin/sh was not actually performed if
command was NULL; instead it was always assumed to be
available, and system() always returned 1 in this case.
Since glibc 2.1.3, this check is performed because, even
though POSIX.1-2001 requires a conforming implementation to
provide a shell, that shell may not be available or
executable if the calling program has previously called
chroot(2) (which is not specified by POSIX.1-2001).</p>

<p>It is possible for the shell command to return 127, so
that code is not a sure indication that the execve(2) call
failed.</p>
