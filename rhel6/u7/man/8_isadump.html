<p>ISADUMP(8) ISADUMP(8)</p>

<p>NAME isadump - examine ISA registers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isadump [-y] [-k V1,V2...] addrreg datareg
[bank [bankreg]] #for I2C- like access isadump [-y] -f
address [range [bank [bankreg]]] #for flat address space</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION isadump is a small helper program to examine
registers visible through the ISA bus. It is intended to
probe any chip that lives on the ISA bus working with an
address register and a data register (I2C-like access) or a
flat range (of up to 256 bytes).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Enable flat address space mode.</p>

<p>-y Disable interactive mode. By default, isadump will
wait for a confirmation from the user before messing with
the ISA bus. When this flag is used, it will perform the
operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.</p>

<p>-k V1,V2... Specify a comma-separated list of bytes to
send as the key sequence to enter the chip configuration
mode. Most Super-I/O chips need this. Known key sequences
are: 0x87,0x01,0x55,0x55 for ITE, 0x55 for SMSC, 0x87,0x87
for Winbond and VIA, none needed for National
Semiconductor.</p>

<p>OPTIONS (I2C-like access mode) At least two options must
be provided to isadump. addrreg contains the ISA address of
the address register for the chip to probe; datareg con-
tains the address of the data register. Both addresses are
integers between 0x0000 and 0x3FFF. Usually, if the chips
base address is 0x0nn0, the address register is at 0x0nn5
and the data register is at 0x0nn6. The most common base
address for hardware monitoring chips is 0x0290.</p>

<p>For Super-I/O chips, address register is typically at
0x2E with data register at 0x2F.</p>

<p>The bank and bankreg parameters are useful on the
Winbond chips as well as on Super-I/O chips. bank is an
integer between 0 and 31, and bankreg is an integer between
0x00 and 0xFF (default value: 0x4E for Winbond chips, 0x07
for Super-I/O chips). The W83781D datasheet has more
information on bank selection.</p>

<p>OPTIONS (flat address space mode) In flat mode, only one
parameter is mandatory. address contains the ISA address of
the chip to probe; it is an integer between 0x0000 and
0xFFFF. If provided, range is how many bytes should be read
(must be a multiple of 16). If the range isnt provided, it
defaults to 256 bytes and the address is forcibly aligned on
a 256-byte boundary.</p>

<p>The bank and bankreg parameters are useful on the
National Semiconduc- tor PC87365 and PC87366 Super-I/O
chips. bank is an integer between 0 and 31, and bankreg is
an integer between 0x00 and 0xFF (default value: 0x09; must
fit in the specified range). See the PC87365 datasheet for
more information on bank selection.</p>

<p>NOTES If no bank is specified, no bank change operation
is performed.</p>

<p>If a bank is specified, the original value is restored
before isadump exits.</p>

<p>Dumping Super-I/O chips is typically a two-step process.
First, you will have to access the main Super-I/O address
using a command like: isadump 0x2e 0x2f 0x09. This will
select logical device 9 (correct value depend on the chip).
At 0x60 you will find the logical device address word, for
example &quot;ec c0&quot;. Then you can use a command like:
isadump -f 0xecc0 16. This will dump the logical device
registers. The correct range depends on the chip.</p>

<p>WARNING Poking around in ISA data space is extremely
dangerous. Running isad- ump with random parameters can
cause system crashes, data loss, and worse! Be extremely
careful when using this program.</p>
