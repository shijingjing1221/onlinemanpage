<p>TMPNAM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TMPNAM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tmpnam - create a name for a temporary file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *tmpnam(char *s);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tmpnam() function shall generate a
string that is a valid filename and that is not the same as
the name of an existing file. The function is potentially
capable of generating {TMP_MAX} different strings, but any
or all of them may already be in use by existing files and
thus not be suitable return values.</p>

<p>The tmpnam() function generates a different string each
time it is called from the same process, up to {TMP_MAX}
times. If it is called more than {TMP_MAX} times, the
behavior is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The implementation shall behave as if no function
defined in this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 calls
tmpnam().</p>

<p>If the application uses any of the functions guaranteed
to be available if either _POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS or
_POSIX_THREADS is defined, the application shall ensure that
the tmpnam() function is called with a non-NULL
parameter.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, tmpnam() shall
return a pointer to a string. If no suitable string can be
generated, the tmpnam() function shall return a null
pointer.</p>

<p>If the argument s is a null pointer, tmpnam() shall
leave its result in an internal static object and return a
pointer to that object. Subse- quent calls to tmpnam() may
modify the same object. If the argument s is not a null
pointer, it is presumed to point to an array of at least
L_tmpnam chars; tmpnam() shall write its result in that
array and shall return the argument as its value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Generating a Filename The following example
generates a unique filename and stores it in the array
pointed to by ptr.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... char filename[L_tmpnam+1];
char *ptr;</p>

<p>ptr = tmpnam(filename);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This function only creates filenames.
It is the applications responsi- bility to create and remove
the files.</p>

<p>Between the time a pathname is created and the file is
opened, it is possible for some other process to create a
file with the same name. Applications may find tmpfile()
more useful.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
