<p>I2C_NEW_DEVICE(9) I2C and SMBus Subsystem
I2C_NEW_DEVICE(9)</p>

<p>NAME i2c_new_device - instantiate an i2c device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct i2c_client * i2c_new_device(struct
i2c_adapter * adap, struct i2c_board_info const * info);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS adap the adapter managing the device</p>

<p>info describes one I2C device; bus_num is ignored</p>

<p>CONTEXT can sleep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Create an i2c device. Binding is handled
through driver model probe/remove methods. A driver may be
bound to this device when we return from this function, or
any later moment (e.g. maybe hotplugging will load the
driver module). This call is not appropriate for use by
mainboard initialization logic, which usually runs during an
arch_initcall long before any i2c_adapter could exist.</p>

<p>This returns the new i2c client, which may be saved for
later use with i2c_unregister_device; or NULL to indicate an
error.</p>
