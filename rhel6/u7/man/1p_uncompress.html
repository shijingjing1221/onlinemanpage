<p>UNCOMPRESS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
UNCOMPRESS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME uncompress - expand compressed data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS uncompress [-cfv][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uncompress utility shall restore files
to their original state after they have been compressed
using the compress utility. If no files are specified, the
standard input shall be uncompressed to the standard output.
If the invoking process has appropriate privileges, the
ownership, modes, access time, and modification time of the
origi- nal file shall be preserved.</p>

<p>This utility shall support the uncompressing of any
files produced by the compress utility on the same
implementation. For files produced by compress on other
systems, uncompress supports 9 to 14-bit compression (see
compress, -b); it is implementation-defined whether values
of -b greater than 14 are supported.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The uncompress utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Write to standard output; no files are changed.</p>

<p>-f Do not prompt for overwriting files. Except when run
in the background, if -f is not given the user shall be
prompted as to whether an existing file should be
overwritten. If the standard input is not a terminal and -f
is not given, uncompress shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error and exit with a status greater than zero.</p>

<p>-v Write messages to standard error concerning the
expansion of each file.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file. If file already has the .Z
suffix speci- fied, it shall be used as the input file and
the output file shall be named file with the .Z suffix
removed. Otherwise, file shall be used as the name of the
output file and file with the .Z suffix appended shall be
used as the input file.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is-.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES Input files shall be in the format produced
by the compress utility.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of uncompress:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When there are no file operands or the -c option
is specified, the uncompressed output is written to standard
output.</p>

<p>STDERR Prompts shall be written to the standard error
output under the condi- tions specified in the DESCRIPTION
and OPTIONS sections. The prompts shall contain the file
pathname, but their format is otherwise unspeci- fied.
Otherwise, the standard error output shall be used only for
diag- nostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES Output files are the same as the respective
input files to compress.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS The input file remains
unmodified.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The limit of 14 on the compress -b
bits argument is to achieve porta- bility to all systems
(within the restrictions imposed by the lack of an explicit
published file format). Some implementations based on 16-bit
architectures cannot support 15 or 16-bit uncompression.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
