<p>NAME perlamiga - Perl under Amiga OS</p>

<p>NOTE Perl 5.8.0 cannot be built in AmigaOS. You can use
either the maintenance release Perl 5.6.1 or the development
release Perl 5.7.2 in AmigaOS. See &quot;PERL 5.8.0 BROKEN
IN AMIGAOS&quot; if you want to help fixing this
problem.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS One can read this document in the following
formats:</p>

<p>man perlamiga multiview perlamiga.guide</p>

<p>to list some (not all may be available simultaneously),
or it may be read as is: either as README.amiga, or
pod/perlamiga.pod.</p>

<p>A recent version of perl for the Amiga can be found at
the Geek Gadgets section of the Aminet:</p>

<p>http://www.aminet.net/~aminet/dev/gg</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Prerequisites for Compiling Perl on AmigaOS
Unix emulation for AmigaOS: ixemul.library You need the Unix
emulation for AmigaOS, whose most important part is
ixemul.library. For a minimum setup, get the latest versions
of the following packages from the Aminet archives (
http://www.aminet.net/~aminet/ ):</p>

<p>ixemul-bin ixemul-env-bin pdksh-bin</p>

<p>Note also that this is a minimum setup; you might want
to add other packages of ADE (the Amiga Developers
Environment).</p>

<p>Version of Amiga OS You need at the very least AmigaOS
version 2.0. Recommended is version 3.1.</p>

<p>Starting Perl programs under AmigaOS Start your Perl
program foo with arguments &quot;arg1 arg2 arg3&quot; the
same way as on any other platform, by</p>

<p>perl foo arg1 arg2 arg3</p>

<p>If you want to specify perl options &quot;-my_opts&quot;
to the perl itself (as opposed to your program), use</p>

<p>perl -my_opts foo arg1 arg2 arg3</p>

<p>Alternately, you can try to get a replacement for the
systems Execute command that honors the #!/usr/bin/perl
syntax in scripts and set the s-Bit of your scripts. Then
you can invoke your scripts like under UNIX with</p>

<p>foo arg1 arg2 arg3</p>

<p>(Note that having *nixish full path to perl
/usr/bin/perl is not necessary, perl would be enough, but
having full path would make it easier to use your script
under *nix.)</p>

<p>Shortcomings of Perl under AmigaOS Perl under AmigaOS
lacks some features of perl under UNIX because of
deficiencies in the UNIX-emulation, most notably:</p>

<p>&middot; fork()</p>

<p>&middot; some features of the UNIX filesystem regarding
link count and file dates</p>

<p>&middot; inplace operation (the -i switch) without
backup file</p>

<p>&middot; umask() works, but the correct permissions are
only set when the file is finally close()d</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Change to the installation directory (most
probably ADE:), and extract the binary distribution:</p>

<p>lha -mraxe x perl-$VERSION-bin.lha</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>tar xvzpf perl-$VERSION-bin.tgz</p>

<p>(Of course you need lha or tar and gunzip for this.)</p>

<p>For installation of the Unix emulation, read the
appropriate docs.</p>

<p>Accessing documentation Manpages for Perl on AmigaOS If
you have &quot;man&quot; installed on your system, and you
installed perl manpages, use something like this:</p>

<p>man perlfunc man less man ExtUtils.MakeMaker</p>

<p>to access documentation for different components of
Perl. Start with</p>

<p>man perl</p>

<p>Note: You have to modify your man.conf file to search
for manpages in the /ade/lib/perl5/man/man3 directory, or
the man pages for the perl library will not be found.</p>

<p>Note that dot (.) is used as a package separator for
documentation for packages, and as usual, sometimes you need
to give the section - 3 above - to avoid shadowing by the
less(1) manpage.</p>

<p>Perl HTML Documentation on AmigaOS If you have some WWW
browser available, you can build HTML docs. Cd to directory
with .pod files, and do like this</p>

<p>cd /ade/lib/perl5/pod pod2html</p>

<p>After this you can direct your browser the file
perl.html in this directory, and go ahead with reading
docs.</p>

<p>Alternatively you may be able to get these docs prebuilt
from &quot;CPAN&quot;.</p>

<p>Perl GNU Info Files on AmigaOS Users of
&quot;Emacs&quot; would appreciate it very much, especially
with &quot;CPerl&quot; mode loaded. You need to get latest
&quot;pod2info&quot; from &quot;CPAN&quot;, or, alternately,
prebuilt info pages.</p>

<p>Perl LaTeX Documentation on AmigaOS Can be constructed
using &quot;pod2latex&quot;.</p>

<p>BUILDING PERL ON AMIGAOS Here we discuss how to build
Perl under AmigaOS.</p>

<p>Build Prerequisites for Perl on AmigaOS You need to have
the latest ixemul (Unix emulation for Amiga) from
Aminet.</p>

<p>Getting the Perl Source for AmigaOS You can either get
the latest perl-for-amiga source from Ninemoons and extract
it with:</p>

<p>tar xvzpf perl-$VERSION-src.tgz</p>

<p>or get the official source from CPAN:</p>

<p>http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0</p>

<p>Extract it like this</p>

<p>tar xvzpf perl-$VERSION.tar.gz</p>

<p>You will see a message about errors while extracting
Configure. This is normal and expected. (There is a conflict
with a similarly-named file configure, but it causes no
harm.)</p>

<p>Making Perl on AmigaOS Remember to use a hefty wad of
stack (I use 2000000)</p>

<p>sh configure.gnu --prefix=/gg</p>

<p>Now type</p>

<p>make depend</p>

<p>Now!</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>Testing Perl on AmigaOS Now run</p>

<p>make test</p>

<p>Some tests will be skipped because they need the fork()
function:</p>

<p>io/pipe.t, op/fork.t, lib/filehand.t, lib/open2.t,
lib/open3.t, lib/io_pipe.t, lib/io_sock.t</p>

<p>Installing the built Perl on AmigaOS Run</p>

<p>make install</p>

<p>PERL 5.8.0 BROKEN IN AMIGAOS As told above, Perl 5.6.1
was still good in AmigaOS, as was 5.7.2. After Perl 5.7.2
(change #11423, see the Changes file, and the file
pod/perlhack.pod for how to get the individual changes) Perl
dropped its internal support for vfork(), and that was very
probably the step that broke AmigaOS (since the ixemul
library has only vfork). The build finally fails when the
ext/DynaLoader is being built, and PERL ends up as
&quot;0&quot; in the produced Makefile, trying to run
&quot;0&quot; does not quite work. Also, executing miniperl
in backticks seems to generate nothing: very probably
related to the (v)fork problems. Fixing the breakage
requires someone quite familiar with the ixemul library, and
how one is supposed to run external commands in AmigaOS
without fork().</p>
