<p>NAME winicontoppm - convert a Windows .ico image into 1
or more PPM images</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS winicontoppm [-writeands] [-allicons|-bestqual]
[-multippm] [-verbose] [iconfile] [ppmdestfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>winicontoppm reads a Microsoft Windows .ico file and
converts it to one or more PPMs.</p>

<p>A Windows icon contains one or more images, at different
resolutions and color depths. Each image has an and mask,
which contains transparancy data.</p>

<p>By default, the output goes to Standard Output. If you
specify ppmdestfile, output goes into one or more files
named as follows. If it s just one file (i.e. you specify
the -multippm option or dont specify -allicons), the file
name is ppmdestfile.ppm. If its multiple files, their file
names are ppmdestfile_1.ppm, ppmdestfile_2.ppm, etc.</p>

<p>When you specify the -writeands option, the file names
above are modi- fied to include the string xor as in
ppmdestfile_xor.ppm or ppmdest- file_xor_1.ppm.</p>

<p>winicontoppm can convert .ico images with 1, 4, 8, 24,
or 32 bits per pixel. Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), it
could not handle 24 and 32.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -writeands For each icon written, also write the
and (transparancy) mask as a separate PBM file. Its name is
of the form ppmdest- file_and.pbm or
ppmdestfile_and_1.pbm.</p>

<p>-allicons Extract all images from the .ico file.</p>

<p>-bestqual Extract only the best quality (largest, then
highest bpp) image from the .ico file.</p>

<p>-multippm Write all PPMs to a single file.</p>
