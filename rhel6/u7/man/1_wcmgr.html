<p>wcmgr(1) The Webalizer wcmgr(1)</p>

<p>NAME wcmgr - Webalizer (DNS) Cache file Manager</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wcmgr [ option ... ] cache-file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wcmgr is a utility program which allows
manipulation of the DNS cache files used and produced by The
Webalizer. Each record in the cache file contains an IP
address (either IPv4 or IPv6), a timestamp of when the entry
was added to the cache, a flag to indicate if the record
con- tains a resolved name or not, and either the same IP
address or a resolved host name. All records are accessed by
their IP address.</p>

<p>RUNNING WCMGR wcmgr was designed to be run from the Unix
shell command line. This facilitates its use in shell
scripts and other automated processes. A valid DNS cache
file must be specified. Command line options are optional,
and if none are given, the default action is to list the
con- tents of the specified cache file.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS Different functions are selected by
using one or more of the following command line options. If
no options are given, the default is to dis- play the
contents of the cache file to the screen (stdout).</p>

<p>-h Display all available command line options and
exit.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose.</p>

<p>-V Display the program version and exit. Additional
program spe- cific information will be displayed if verbose
mode is also used (e.g. -vV ), which can be useful when
submitting bug reports.</p>

<p>-a address [-n hostname] [-t0] Add a new record to the
cache file. The IP address will be added to the cache file
using the current time as the timestamp and with a resolved
name hostname. If -t0 is specified, the record will be
considered permanent, and will not be removed (during a
purge) or expired. If a hostname is not specified with the
-n option, then the address will be used instead, and the
record will be flagged as unresolved.</p>

<p>-c Create a new cache file. If used alone, this option
will cre- ate a new, empty cache file. If used with the
import option, a new cache file will be created before
importing the data. An error will occur if the file
cache-file already exists.</p>

<p>-d address Delete a record from the cache file using the
specified address.</p>

<p>-f address Find and display information for address from
the cache file. A single line similar to that produced by
the -l option will be displayed unless verbose mode is
enabled, in which case a more detailed listing will be
produced.</p>

<p>-i name [-c] Import data into the cache file from the
file name. The import file must be a valid tab delimited
text file, such as that cre- ated by the export option. If
the imported data contains records already present in the
cache file, those records will be overwritten by the
imported data. The cache file must exist unless the -c
option is specified, in which case, a new cache file will be
created for the imported data.</p>

<p>-l List the contents of the cache file. This is the
default action of the program, so does not necessarily need
to be spec- ified. If verbose mode is enabled, a report
title, column headers and summary totals will also be
displayed.</p>

<p>-p num Purge the cache file of entries older than num
days. If num is not specified, then a default of 7 days will
be used. if ver- bose mode is enabled, each purged record
will be printed and the total number of purged records will
be displayed.</p>

<p>-s [-t num] Display cache file information/statistics.
If a TTL value (in days) is specified using the -t option,
it will be used to cal- culate how many records are older
than num days, otherwise, the default value of 7 days will
be used.</p>

<p>-n name Specify the name to use as the resolved hostname
when adding records to the cache.</p>

<p>-t num Time to live (TTL) value. If used along with the
-p (purge) option, it specifies how many days a record will
remain valid. Any record that is older than num days is
considered expired and will be purged. If used with the -a
(add) option, a zero value will cause the record to be
considered permanent.</p>

<p>-x name Export data from a cache file to a tab delimited
text file named name. If the text file name exists, it will
be overwrit- ten.</p>
