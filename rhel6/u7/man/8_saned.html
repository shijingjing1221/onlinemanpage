<p>saned(8) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy saned(8)</p>

<p>NAME saned - SANE network daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS saned [ -a [ username ] | -d [ n ] | -s [ n ]
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION saned is the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
daemon that allows remote clients to access image
acquisition devices available on the local host.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The -a flag requests that saned run in
standalone daemon mode. In this mode, saned will detach from
the console and run in the background, listening for
incoming client connections; inetd is not required for saned
operations in this mode. If the optional username is given
after -a , saned will drop root privileges and run as this
user (and group).</p>

<p>The -d and -s flags request that saned run in debug mode
(as opposed to inetd(8) mode). In this mode, saned
explicitly waits for a connection request. When compiled
with debugging enabled, these flags may be fol- lowed by a
number to request debug info. The larger the number, the
more verbose the debug output. E.g., -d128 will request
printing of all debug info. Debug level 0 means no debug
output at all. The default value is 2. If flag -d is used,
the debug messages will be printed to stderr while -s
requests using syslog.</p>

<p>If saned is run from inetd or xinetd, no option can be
given.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION First and foremost: saned is not intended
to be exposed to the internet or other non-trusted networks.
Make sure that access is limited by tcp- wrappers and/or a
firewall setup. Dont depend only on saneds own
authentication. Don t run saned as root if it s not
necessary. And do not install saned as setuid root.</p>

<p>The saned.conf configuration file contains both options
for the daemon and the access list.</p>

<p>data_portrange = min_port - max_port Specify the port
range to use for the data connection. Pick a port range
between 1024 and 65535; dont pick a too large port range, as
it may have performance issues. Use this option if your
saned server is sitting behind a firewall. If that firewall
is a Linux machine, we strongly recommend using the
Netfilter nf_conntrack_sane module instead.</p>

<p>The access list is a list of host names, IP addresses or
IP subnets (CIDR notation) that are permitted to use local
SANE devices. IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets,
and should always be specified in their compressed form.
Connections from localhost are always permit- ted. Empty
lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored. A
line containing the single character + is interpreted to
match any hostname. This allows any remote machine to use
your scanner and may present a security risk, so this
shouldnt be used unless you know what youre doing.</p>

<p>A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p># Daemon options data_portrange = 10000 - 10100 # Access
list scan-client.somedomain.firm # this is a comment
192.168.0.1 192.168.2.12/29 [::1]
[2001:7a8:185e::42:12]/64</p>

<p>The case of the host names does not matter, so AHost.COM
is considered identical to ahost.com.</p>

<p>INETD CONFIGURATION For saned to work properly in its
default mode of operation, it is also necessary to add a
configuration line to /etc/inetd.conf. Note that your inetd
must support IPv6 if you want to connect to saned over IPv6
; xinetd and openbsd-inetd are known to support IPv6, check
the docu- mentation for your inetd daemon.</p>

<p>The configuration line normally looks like this:</p>

<p>sane-port stream tcp nowait saned.saned /usr/sbin/saned
saned</p>

<p>However, if your system uses tcpd(8) for additional
security screening, you may want to disable saned access
control by putting + in saned.conf and use a line of the
following form in /etc/inetd.conf instead:</p>

<p>sane-port stream tcp nowait saned.saned /usr/sbin/tcpd
/usr/sbin/saned</p>

<p>Note that both examples assume that there is a saned
group and a saned user. If you follow this example, please
make sure that the access permissions on the special device
are set such that saned can access the scanner (the program
generally needs read and write access to scan- ner
devices).</p>

<p>If xinetd is installed on your system instead of inetd
the following example for xinetd.conf may be helpful:</p>

<p># default: off # description: The sane server accepts
requests # for network access to a local scanner via the #
network. service sane-port { port = 6566 socket_type =
stream wait = no user = saned group = saned server =
/usr/sbin/saned }</p>

<p>Finally, it is also necessary to add a line of the
following form to /etc/services:</p>

<p>sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon</p>

<p>The official IANA short name for port 6566 is
&quot;sane-port&quot;. The older name &quot;sane&quot; is
now deprecated.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts.equiv The hosts listed in this file are
permitted to access all local SANE devices. Caveat: this
file imposes serious security risks and its use is not
recommended.</p>

<p>/etc/sane.d/saned.conf Contains a list of hosts
permitted to access local SANE devices (see also description
of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/etc/sane.d/saned.users If this file contains lines of
the form</p>

<p>user:password:backend</p>

<p>access to the listed backends is restricted. A backend
may be listed multiple times for different user/password
combinations. The server uses MD5 hashing if supported by
the client.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>
