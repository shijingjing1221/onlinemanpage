<p>LSEEK64(3) Linux Programmer s Manual LSEEK64(3)</p>

<p>NAME lseek64 - reposition 64-bit read/write file
offset</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE #include
&lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>off64_t lseek64(int fd, off64_t offset, int whence);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lseek(2) family of functions reposition
the offset of the open file associated with the file
descriptor fd to offset bytes relative to the start, current
position, or end of the file, when whence has the value
SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, respectively.</p>

<p>For more details, return value, and errors, see
lseek(2).</p>

<p>Four interfaces are available: lseek(2), lseek64(),
llseek(2), and the raw system call _llseek(2).</p>

<p>lseek Prototype:</p>

<p>off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);</p>

<p>lseek(2) uses the type off_t. This is a 32-bit signed
type on 32-bit architectures, unless one compiles with</p>

<p>#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64</p>

<p>in which case it is a 64-bit signed type.</p>

<p>lseek64 Prototype:</p>

<p>off64_t lseek64(int fd, off64_t offset, int whence);</p>

<p>The library routine lseek64() uses a 64-bit type even
when off_t is a 32-bit type. Its prototype (and the type
off64_t) is available only when one compiles with</p>

<p>#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE</p>

<p>The function lseek64() is available since glibc 2.1, and
is defined to be an alias for llseek().</p>

<p>llseek Prototype:</p>

<p>loff_t llseek(int fd, loff_t offset, int whence);</p>

<p>The type loff_t is a 64-bit signed type. The library
routine llseek() is available in libc5 and glibc and works
without special defines. Its prototype was given in
&lt;unistd.h&gt; with libc5, but glibc does not pro- vide a
prototype. This is bad, since a prototype is needed. Users
should add the above prototype, or something equivalent, to
their own source. When users complained about data loss
caused by a miscompila- tion of e2fsck(8), glibc 2.1.3 added
the link-time warning</p>

<p>&quot;the &lsquo;llseek&acute; function may be
dangerous; use &lsquo;lseek64&acute; instead.&quot;</p>

<p>This makes this function unusable if one desires a
warning-free compi- lation.</p>

<p>_llseek All the above functions are implemented in terms
of this system call. The prototype is:</p>

<p>int _llseek(int fd, off_t offset_hi, off_t offset_lo,
loff_t *result, int whence);</p>

<p>For more details, see llseek(2).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO llseek(2), lseek(2), feature_test_macros(7)</p>
