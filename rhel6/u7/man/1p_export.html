<p>EXPORT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual EXPORT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME export - set the export attribute for variables</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS export name[=word]...</p>

<p>export -p</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shell shall give the export attribute to
the variables correspond- ing to the specified names, which
shall cause them to be in the envi- ronment of subsequently
executed commands. If the name of a variable is followed by
= word, then the value of that variable shall be set to
word.</p>

<p>The export special built-in shall support the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>When -p is specified, export shall write to the standard
output the names and values of all exported variables, in
the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;export %s=%n&quot;, &lt;name&gt;,
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>if name is set, and:</p>

<p>&quot;export %n&quot;, &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>if name is unset.</p>

<p>The shell shall format the output, including the proper
use of quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the
shell as commands that achieve the same exporting results,
except:</p>

<p>1. Read-only variables with values cannot be reset.</p>

<p>2. Variables that were unset at the time they were
output need not be reset to the unset state if a value is
assigned to the variable between the time the state was
saved and the time at which the saved output is reinput to
the shell.</p>

<p>When no arguments are given, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Zero.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Export PWD and HOME variables:</p>

<p>export PWD HOME</p>

<p>Set and export the PATH variable:</p>

<p>export PATH=/local/bin:$PATH</p>

<p>Save and restore all exported variables:</p>

<p>export -p &gt; temp-fileunset a lot of variables...
processing. temp-file</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some historical shells use the no-argument
case as the functional equivalent of what is required here
with -p. This feature was left unspecified because it is not
historical practice in all shells, and some scripts may rely
on the now-unspecified results on their implemen- tations.
Attempts to specify the -p output as the default case were
unsuccessful in achieving consensus. The -p option was added
to allow portable access to the values that can be saved and
then later restored using; for example, a dot script.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
