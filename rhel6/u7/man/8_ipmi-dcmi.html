<p>IPMI-DCMI(8) System Commands IPMI-DCMI(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipmi-dcmi - IPMI DCMI utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipmi-dcmi [OPTION...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ipmi-dcmi is used to execute Data Center
Manageability Interface (often referred to as DCM or DCMI)
IPMI extension commands. DCMI extensions include support for
asset management and power usage management. Most will be
interested in DCMI for its power management features. By
con- figuring an exception action, power limit, and
correction time limit, power usage in a data center can be
managed more affectively. Please see --set-power-limit
option below for more information.</p>

<p>The DCMI specification encompasses many traditional IPMI
features that are not implemented directly in this tool.
Please see ipmiconsole(8) for Serial-over-LAN (SOL) support,
ipmi-chassis(8) for power status, power control,
identification, and ACPI power state information,
ipmipower(8) for power status and power control, ipmi-sel(8)
for System Event Log (SEL) information, bmc-info(8) for
device and globally unique ID (guid) information,
ipmi-sensors(8) for sensor readings, and bmc- config(8) for
configuration.</p>

<p>Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific
options, trouble shooting information, workaround
information, examples, and known issues. For a general
introduction to FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7).</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS The following options are general
options for configuring IPMI communi- cation and executing
general tool commands.</p>

<p>-D IPMIDRIVER, --driver-type=IPMIDRIVER Specify the
driver type to use instead of doing an auto selec- tion. The
currently available outofband drivers are LAN and LAN_2_0,
which perform IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 respectively. The
currently available inband drivers are KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI,
and SUNBMC.</p>

<p>--disable-auto-probe Do not probe in-band IPMI devices
for default settings.</p>

<p>--driver-address=DRIVER-ADDRESS Specify the in-band
driver address to be used instead of the probed value.
DRIVER-ADDRESS should be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; for a
hex value and 0 for an octal value.</p>

<p>--driver-device=DEVICE Specify the in-band driver device
path to be used instead of the probed path.</p>

<p>--register-spacing=REGISTER-SPACING Specify the in-band
driver register spacing instead of the probed value.
Argument is in bytes (i.e. 32bit register spacing = 4)</p>

<p>--target-channel-number=CHANNEL-NUMBER Specify the
in-band driver target channel number to send IPMI requests
to.</p>

<p>--target-slave-address=SLAVE-ADDRESS Specify the in-band
driver target slave number to send IPMI requests to.</p>

<p>-h IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...,
--hostname=IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMI- HOST2[:PORT],... Specify
the remote host(s) to communicate with. Multiple host- names
may be separated by comma or may be specified in a range
format; see HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below. An optional port can
be specified with each host, which may be useful in port
forwarding or similar situations.</p>

<p>-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME Specify the username to
use when authenticating with the remote host. If not
specified, a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The
user must have atleast ADMIN privileges in order for this
tool to operate fully.</p>

<p>-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD Specify the password to
use when authenticationg with the remote host. If not
specified, a null password is assumed. Maximum password
length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p>-P, --password-prompt Prompt for password to avoid
possibility of listing it in pro- cess lists.</p>

<p>-k K_G, --k-g=K_G Specify the K_g BMC key to use when
authenticating with the remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not
specified, a null key is assumed. To input the key in
hexadecimal form, prefix the string with 0x. E.g., the key
abc can be entered with the either the string abc or the
string 0x616263</p>

<p>-K, --k-g-prompt Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of
listing it in process lists.</p>

<p>--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the session
timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20
seconds) if not specified.</p>

<p>--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the packet
retransmission timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000
milliseconds (1 second) if not specified. The retransmission
timeout cannot be larger than the session time- out.</p>

<p>-a AUTHENTICATION-TYPE,
--authentication-type=AUTHENTICATION-TYPE Specify the IPMI
1.5 authentication type to use. The currently available
authentication types are NONE, STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2,
and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not specified.</p>

<p>-I CIPHER-SUITE-ID, --cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidential- ity algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0
communication. The authenti- cation algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The following cipher suite ids
are currently supported:</p>

<p>0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm
= None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>3 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>7 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>8 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>16 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>17 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>-l PRIVILEGE-LEVEL, --privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL
Specify the privilege level to be used. The currently
available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to ADMIN if not specified.</p>

<p>--config-file=FILE Specify an alternate configuration
file.</p>

<p>-W WORKAROUNDS, --workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS Specify
workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
com- mand line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
workarounds (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p>--debug Turn on debugging.</p>

<p>-?, --help Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p>--usage Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p>IPMI-DCMI OPTIONS The following options are specific to
Ipmi-dcmi.</p>

<p>--get-dcmi-capability-info Get DCMI capability
information.</p>

<p>--get-asset-tag Get asset tag.</p>

<p>--set-asset-tag=STRING Set asset tag.</p>

<p>--get-management-controller-identifier-string Get
management controller identifier string tag.</p>

<p>--set-management-controller-identifier-string=STRING Set
management controller identifier string tag.</p>

<p>--get-dcmi-sensor-info Get DCMI sensor information.</p>

<p>--get-system-power-statistics Get system power
statistics.</p>

<p>--get-enhanced-system-power-statistics Get enhanced
system power statistics.</p>

<p>--get-power-limit Get power limit information.</p>

<p>--set-power-limit Set power limit configuration. Can
specify configuration via the --exception-actions,
--power-limit-requested, --correc- tion-time-limit, and
--correction-time-limit options listed below. If one or more
options below are not specified, current configuration will
be utilized.</p>

<p>--exception-actions=BITMASK Specify exception actions
for set power limit configuration. Special case allowable
values: NO_ACTION, HARD_POWER_OFF_SYSTEM,
LOG_EVENT_TO_SEL_ONLY. Other values (e.g. 0x02 through 0x10)
are OEM dependent. Used with the --set-power-limit
option.</p>

<p>--power-limit-requested=WATTS Specify power limit for
set power limit configuration. Input is specified in watts.
Used with the --set-power-limit option.</p>

<p>--correction-time-limit=MILLISECONDS Specify correction
time limit for set power limit configuration. Input is
specified in milliseconds. Used with the --set-power-limit
option.</p>

<p>--statistics-sampling-period=SECONDS Specify management
application statistics sampling period for set power limit
configuration. Input is specified in seconds. Used with the
--set-power-limit option.</p>

<p>--activate-deactivate-power-limit=OPERATION Activate or
deactivate power limit. Allowed values: ACTIVATE,
DEACTIVATE.</p>

<p>--interpret-oem-data Attempt to interpret OEM data, such
as event data, sensor read- ings, or general extra info,
etc. If an OEM interpretation is not available, the default
output will be generated. Correctness of OEM interpretations
cannot be guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors
may make in products, firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION
below for confirmed supported motherboard inter-
pretations.</p>

<p>HOSTRANGED OPTIONS The following options manipulate
hostranged output. See HOSTRANGED SUP- PORT below for
additional information on hostranges.</p>

<p>-B, --buffer-output Buffer hostranged output. For each
node, buffer standard output until the node has completed
its IPMI operation. When specifying this option, data may
appear to output slower to the user since the the entire
IPMI operation must complete before any data can be output.
See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional informa-
tion.</p>

<p>-C, --consolidate-output Consolidate hostranged output.
The complete standard output from every node specified will
be consolidated so that nodes with identical output are not
output twice. A header will list those nodes with the
consolidated output. When this option is speci- fied, no
output can be seen until the IPMI operations to all nodes
has completed. If the user breaks out of the program early,
all currently consolidated output will be dumped. See
HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for additional information.</p>

<p>-F NUM, --fanout=NUM Specify multiple host fanout. A
&quot;sliding window&quot; (or fanout) algorithm is used for
parallel IPMI communication so that slower nodes or timed
out nodes will not impede parallel communication. The
maximum number of threads available at the same time is lim-
ited by the fanout. The default is 64.</p>

<p>-E, --eliminate Eliminate hosts determined as undetected
by ipmidetect. This attempts to remove the common issue of
hostranged execution tim- ing out due to several nodes being
removed from service in a large cluster. The ipmidetectd
daemon must be running on the node executing the
command.</p>

<p>--always-prefix Always prefix output, even if only one
host is specified or com- municating in-band. This option is
primarily useful for script- ing purposes. Option will be
ignored if specified with the -C option.</p>

<p>HOSTRANGED SUPPORT Multiple hosts can be input either as
an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of
hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l- k,...], where n
&lt; m and l &lt; k, etc. The later form should not be con-
fused with regular expression character classes (also
denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1
or foo9, but rather repre- sents a degenerate range:
foo19.</p>

<p>This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on
clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and specification
of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p>Some examples of range usage follow: foo[01-05] instead
of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 foo[7,9-10] instead of
foo7,foo9,foo10 foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p>As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret
brackets ([ and ]) for pattern matching. Depending on your
shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within
quotes.</p>

<p>When multiple hosts are specified by the user, a thread
will be exe- cuted for each host in parallel up to the
configured fanout (which can be adjusted via the -F option).
This will allow communication to large numbers of nodes far
more quickly than if done in serial.</p>

<p>By default, standard output from each node specified
will be output with the hostname prepended to each line.
Although this output is read- able in many situations, it
may be difficult to read in other situa- tions. For example,
output from multiple nodes may be mixed together. The -B and
-C options can be used to change this default.</p>

<p>In-band IPMI Communication will be used when the host
&quot;localhost&quot; is specified. This allows the user to
add the localhost into the hos- tranged output.</p>

<p>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING Most often, IPMI problems are
due to configuration problems.</p>

<p>IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the
remote machines BMC. Double check to make sure the following
are configured properly in the remote machine s BMC: IP
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privi- lege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration settings.</p>

<p>Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly
configured drivers or non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p>In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please
see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any vendor
specific bugs that have been dis- covered and worked
around.</p>

<p>Listed below are many of the common issues for error
messages. For additional support, please e-mail the
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing list.</p>

<p>&quot;username invalid&quot; - The username entered (or
a NULL username if none was entered) is not available on the
remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC s
username configuration is incorrect.</p>

<p>&quot;password invalid&quot; - The password entered (or
a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
also be possible the password for the user is not correctly
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;password verification timeout&quot; - Password
verification has timed out. A &quot;password invalid&quot;
error (described above) or a generic &quot;session
timeout&quot; (described below) occurred. During this point
in the protocol it cannot be differentiated which
occurred.</p>

<p>&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL
K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It may also be
possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI
command requires a higher user privilege than the one
authenticated with. Please try to authenticate with a higher
privilege. This may require authenticating to a different
user which has a higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level cannot be obtained for this
user&quot; - The privilege level you are attempting to
authenticate with is higher than the maxi- mum allowed for
this user. Please try again with a lower privilege. It may
also be possible the maximum privilege level allowed for a
user is not configured properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted
privilege level&quot; - The authentication type you wish to
authenticate with is not available for this privilege level.
Please try again with an alternate authentication type or
alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the
avail- able authentication types you can authenticate with
are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;cipher suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher
suite id you wish to authen- ticate with is not available on
the remote BMC. Please try again with an alternate cipher
suite id. It may also be possible the available cipher suite
ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not
discovered on the remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5
instead.</p>

<p>&quot;connection timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI
communication failed. A number of potential errors are
possible, including an invalid hostname specified, an IPMI
IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the
remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please
verify con- figuration and connectivity.</p>

<p>&quot;session timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed
out. Please reconnect. If this error occurs often, you may
wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote
BMCs are considerably slower than others.</p>

<p>&quot;device not found&quot; - The specified device
could not be found. Please check configuration or inputs and
try again.</p>

<p>&quot;driver timeout&quot; - Communication with the
driver or device has timed out. Please try again.</p>

<p>&quot;message timeout&quot; - Communication with the
driver or device has timed out. Please try again.</p>

<p>&quot;BMC busy&quot; - The BMC is currently busy. It may
be processing informa- tion or have too many simultaneous
sessions to manage. Please wait and try again.</p>

<p>&quot;could not find inband device&quot; - An inband
device could not be found. Please check configuration or
specify specific device or driver on the command line.</p>

<p>&quot;driver timeout&quot; - The inband driver has timed
out communicating to the local BMC or service processor. The
BMC or service processor may be busy or (worst case)
possibly non-functioning.</p>

<p>WORKAROUNDS With so many different vendors implementing
their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a
number of workarounds currently available to han- dle
discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds
have been implemented so they will be transparent to the
user. However, some will require the user to specify a
workaround be used via the -W option.</p>

<p>The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware
that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware
may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not
listed.</p>

<p>If you believe your hardware has an additional
compliance issue that needs a workaround to be implemented,
please contact the FreeIPMI main- tainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p>assumeio - This workaround flag will assume inband
interfaces communi- cate with system I/O rather than being
memory-mapped. This will work around systems that report
invalid base addresses. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;device not supported&quot; or &quot;could not find
inband device&quot; errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant
DL145 G1.</p>

<p>spinpoll - This workaround flag will inform some inband
drivers (most notably the KCS driver) to spin while polling
rather than putting the process to sleep. This may
significantly improve the wall clock running time of tools
because an operating system scheduler s granularity may be
much larger than the time it takes to perform a single IPMI
message transaction. However, by spinning, your system may
be performing less useful work by not contexting out the
tool for a more useful task.</p>

<p>authcap - This workaround flag will skip early checks
for username capabilities, authentication capabilities, and
K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It
works around multiple issues in which the remote system does
not properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire
2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p>idzero - This workaround flag will allow empty session
IDs to be accepted by the client. It works around IPMI
sessions that report empty session IDs to the client. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>

<p>unexpectedauth - This workaround flag will allow
unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked as though they
were expected. It works around an issue when packets contain
non-null authentication data when they should be null due to
disabled per-message authentication. Those hit- ting this
issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on
newer firmware.</p>

<p>forcepermsg - This workaround flag will force
per-message authentica- tion to be used no matter what is
advertised by the remote system. It works around an issue
when per-message authentication is advertised as disabled on
the remote system, but it is actually required for the pro-
tocol. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;session
timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>

<p>endianseq - This workaround flag will flip the endian of
the session sequence numbers to allow the session to
continue properly. It works around IPMI 1.5 session sequence
numbers that are the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue
may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed
on some Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor
endian).</p>

<p>noauthcodecheck - This workaround flag will tell
FreeIPMI to not check the authentication codes returned from
IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works around systems to
return invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the valid- ity of a packet. However, in most organizations,
this is unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;connection time- out&quot;,
&quot;session timeout&quot;, or &quot;password verification
timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Xyratex
FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p>intel20 - This workaround flag will work around several
Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered
include padding of usernames, and password truncation if the
authentication algorithm is HMAC- MD5-128. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;,
&quot;password invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server
Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p>supermicro20 - This workaround flag will work around
several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI firmware. The issues covered
include handling invalid length authenti- cation codes.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;password
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME
with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver
firmware.</p>

<p>sun20 - This workaround flag will work work around
several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
covered include invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly
hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc
error&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire
4100/4200/4500 with ILOM. This workaround automatically
includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.</p>

<p>opensesspriv - This workaround flag will slightly alter
FreeIPMIs IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an
invalid hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The
privilege level sent during the Open Session stage of an
IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the
privilege level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;password
invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad
rmcpplus status code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun
Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II,
Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta
QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is automatically
triggered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p>integritycheckvalue - This workaround flag will work
around an invalid integrity check value during an IPMI 2.0
session establishment when using Cipher Suite ID 0. The
integrity check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro
512X.</p>

<p>No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support
IPMI 2.0 have been found to not support IPMI 1.5. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
or &quot;connection timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be
worked around by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by
specifying --driver-address=LAN_2_0. Issue observed on HP
Proliant DL 145.</p>

<p>OEM INTERPRETATION The following motherboards are
confirmed to have atleast some support by the
--interpret-oem-data option. While highly probable the OEM
data interpretations would work across other motherboards by
the same manu- facturer, there are no guarantees. Some of
the motherboards below may be rebranded by
vendors/distributors.</p>

<p>Currently None</p>

<p>EXAMPLES # ipmi-dcmi --get-power-limit</p>

<p>Get power limit of the local machine.</p>

<p># ipmi-dcmi -h ahost -u myusername -p mypassword
--get-power-limit</p>

<p>Get power limit of a remote machine using IPMI over
LAN.</p>

<p># ipmi-dcmi -h mycluster[0-127] -u myusername -p
mypassword --get- power-limit</p>

<p>Get power limit across a cluster using IPMI over
LAN.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Upon successful execution, exit status is 0.
On error, exit status is 1.</p>

<p>If multiple hosts are specified for communication, the
exit status is 0 if and only if all targets successfully
execute. Otherwise the exit status is 1.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES On older operating systems, if you input
your username, password, and other potentially security
relevant information on the command line, this information
may be discovered by other users when using tools like the
ps(1) command or looking in the /proc file system. It is
generally more secure to input password information with
options like the -P or -K options. Configuring security
relevant information in the FreeIPMI configuration file
would also be an appropriate way to hide this infor-
mation.</p>

<p>In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will
temporarily &quot;lock up&quot; after a number of remote
authentication errors. You may need to wait awhile in order
to this temporary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may
authenticate again.</p>
