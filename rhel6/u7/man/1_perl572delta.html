<p>PERL572DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL572DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl572delta - whats new for perl v5.7.2</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.7.1 release and the 5.7.2 release.</p>

<p>(To view the differences between the 5.6.0 release and
the 5.7.0 release, see perl570delta. To view the differences
between the 5.7.0 release and the 5.7.1 release, see
perl571delta.)</p>

<p>Security Vulnerability Closed (This change was already
made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)</p>

<p>A security vulnerability affecting all Perl versions
prior to 5.6.1 was found in August 2000. The vulnerability
does not affect default installations and as far as is known
affects only the Linux platform.</p>

<p>You should upgrade your Perl to 5.6.1 as soon as
possible. Patches for earlier releases exist but using the
patches require full recompilation from the source code
anyway, so 5.6.1 is your best choice.</p>

<p>See
http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt
for more information.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes 64-bit platforms and malloc If your
pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl malloc is no more being
used because it simply does not work with 8-byte pointers.
Also, usually the system malloc on such platforms are much
better optimized for such large memory models than the Perl
malloc.</p>

<p>AIX Dynaloading The AIX dynaloading now uses in AIX
releases 4.3 and newer the native dlopen interface of AIX
instead of the old emulated interface. This change will
probably break backward compatibility with compiled modules.
The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other
applications like modperl which are using the AIX native
interface.</p>

<p>Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS The Socket extension is
now dynamically loaded instead of being statically built in.
This may or may not be a problem with ancient TCP/IP stacks
of VMS: we do not know since we werent able to test Perl in
such configurations.</p>

<p>Different Definition of the Unicode Character
Classep{In...} As suggested by the Unicode consortium, the
Unicode character classes now prefer scripts as opposed to
blocks (as defined by Unicode); in Perl, when the
&quot;{In....}&quot; and the &quot;{In....}&quot; regular
expression constructs are used. This has changed the
definition of some of those character classes.</p>

<p>The difference between scripts and blocks is that
scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of
languages, while the blocks are more artificial groupings of
256 characters based on the Unicode numbering.</p>

<p>In general this change results in more inclusive Unicode
character classes, but changes to the other direction also
do take place: for example while the script
&quot;Latin&quot; includes all the Latin characters and
their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not
include the various punctuation or digits (since they are
not solely &quot;Latin&quot;).</p>

<p>Changes in the character class semantics may have
happened if a script and a block happen to have the same
name, for example &quot;Hebrew&quot;. In such cases the
script wins and &quot;{InHebrew}&quot; now means the script
definition of Hebrew. The block definition in still
available, though, by appending &quot;Block&quot; to the
name: &quot;{InHebrewBlock}&quot; means what
&quot;{InHebrew}&quot; meant in perl 5.6.0. For the full
list of affected character classes, see &quot;Blocks&quot;
in perlunicode.</p>

<p>Deprecations The current user-visible implementation of
pseudo-hashes (the weird use of the first array element) is
deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in
Perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be implemented
differently. Not only is the current interface rather ugly,
but the current implementation slows down normal array and
hash use quite noticeably. The &quot;fields&quot; pragma
interface will remain available.</p>

<p>The syntaxes &quot;@a-&gt;[...]&quot; and
&quot;@h-&gt;{...}&quot; have now been deprecated.</p>

<p>The suidperl is also considered to be too much a risk to
continue maintaining and the suidperl code is likely to be
removed in a future release.</p>

<p>The &quot;package;&quot; syntax (&quot;package&quot;
without an argument has been deprecated. Its semantics were
never that clear and its implementation even less so. If you
have used that feature to disallow all but fully qualified
variables, &quot;use strict;&quot; instead.</p>

<p>The chdir(undef) and chdir() behaviors to match chdir()
has been deprecated. In future versions, chdir(undef) and
chdir( ) will simply fail.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements In general a lot of fixing has
happened in the area of Perls understanding of numbers, both
integer and floating point. Since in many systems the
standard number parsing functions like &quot;strtoul()&quot;
and &quot;atof()&quot; seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work
around their deficiencies. This results hopefully in more
accurate numbers.</p>

<p>&middot; The rules for allowing underscores (underbars)
in numeric constants have been relaxed and simplified: now
you can have an underscore between digits.</p>

<p>&middot; GMAGIC (right-hand side magic) could in many
cases such as string concatenation be invoked too many
times.</p>

<p>&middot; Lexicals I: lexicals outside an eval
&quot;&quot; werent resolved correctly inside a subroutine
definition inside the eval &quot;&quot; if they were not
already referenced in the top level of the
eval&quot;&quot;ed code.</p>

<p>&middot; Lexicals II: lexicals leaked at file scope into
subroutines that were declared before the lexicals.</p>

<p>&middot; Lvalue subroutines can now return
&quot;undef&quot; in list context.</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;op_clear&quot; and
&quot;op_null&quot; are now exported.</p>

<p>&middot; A new special regular expression variable has
been introduced: $^N, which contains the most-recently
closed group (submatch).</p>

<p>&middot; utime now supports &quot;utime undef, undef,
@files&quot; to change the file timestamps to the current
time.</p>

<p>&middot; The Perl parser has been stress tested using
both random input and Markov chain input.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;eval &quot;v200&quot;&quot; now
works.</p>

<p>&middot; VMS now works under PerlIO.</p>

<p>&middot; END blocks are now run even if you exit/die in
a BEGIN block. The execution of END blocks is now controlled
by PL_exit_flags &amp; PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END. This enables
the new behaviour for perl embedders. This will default in
5.10. See perlembed.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata New Modules and Distributions
&middot; Attribute::Handlers - Simpler definition of
attribute handlers</p>

<p>&middot; ExtUtils::Constant - generate XS code to import
C header constants</p>

<p>&middot; I18N::Langinfo - query locale information</p>

<p>&middot; I18N::LangTags - functions for dealing with
RFC3066-style language tags</p>

<p>&middot; libnet - a collection of perl5 modules related
to network programming</p>

<p>Perl installation leaves libnet unconfigured, use
libnetcfg to configure.</p>

<p>&middot; List::Util - selection of general-utility list
subroutines</p>

<p>&middot; Locale::Maketext - framework for
localization</p>

<p>&middot; Memoize - Make your functions faster by trading
space for time</p>

<p>&middot; NEXT - pseudo-class for method redispatch</p>

<p>&middot; Scalar::Util - selection of general-utility
scalar subroutines</p>

<p>&middot; Test::More - yet another framework for writing
test scripts</p>

<p>&middot; Test::Simple - Basic utilities for writing
tests</p>

<p>&middot; Time::HiRes - high resolution ualarm, usleep,
and gettimeofday</p>

<p>&middot; Time::Piece - Object Oriented time objects</p>

<p>(Previously known as Time::Object.)</p>

<p>&middot; Time::Seconds - a simple API to convert seconds
to other date values</p>

<p>&middot; UnicodeCD - Unicode Character Database</p>

<p>Updated And Improved Modules and Pragmata &middot;
B::Deparse module has been significantly enhanced. It now
can deparse almost all of the standard test suite (so that
the tests still succeed). There is a make target
&quot;test.deparse&quot; for trying this out.</p>

<p>&middot; Class::Struct now assigns the array/hash
element if the accessor is called with an array/hash element
as the sole argument.</p>

<p>&middot; Cwd extension is now (even) faster.</p>

<p>&middot; DB_File extension has been updated to version
1.77.</p>

<p>&middot; Fcntl, Socket, and Sys::Syslog have been
rewritten to use the new- style constant dispatch section
(see ExtUtils::Constant).</p>

<p>&middot; File::Find is now (again) reentrant. It also
has been made more portable.</p>

<p>&middot; File::Glob now supports &quot;GLOB_LIMIT&quot;
constant to limit the size of the returned list of
filenames.</p>

<p>&middot; IO::Socket::INET now supports
&quot;LocalPort&quot; of zero (usually meaning that the
operating system will make one up.)</p>

<p>&middot; The vars pragma now supports declaring fully
qualified variables. (Something that &quot;our()&quot; does
not and will not support.)</p>

<p>Utility Changes &middot; The emacs/e2ctags.pl is now
much faster.</p>

<p>&middot; h2ph now supports C trigraphs.</p>

<p>&middot; h2xs uses the new ExtUtils::Constant module
which will affect newly created extensions that define
constants. Since the new code is more correct (if you have
two constants where the first one is a prefix of the second
one, the first constant never gets defined), less lossy (it
uses integers for integer constant, as opposed to the old
code that used floating point numbers even for integer
constants), and slightly faster, you might want to consider
regenerating your extension code (the new scheme makes
regenerating easy). h2xs now also supports C trigraphs.</p>

<p>&middot; libnetcfg has been added to configure the
libnet.</p>

<p>&middot; The Pod::Html (and thusly pod2html) now allows
specifying a cache directory.</p>

<p>New Documentation &middot; Locale::Maketext::TPJ13 is an
article about software localization, originally published in
The Perl Journal #13, republished here with kind
permission.</p>

<p>&middot; More README.$PLATFORM files have been converted
into pod, which also means that they also be installed as
perl$PLATFORM documentation files. The new files are
perlapollo, perlbeos, perldgux, perlhurd, perlmint,
perlnetware, perlplan9, perlqnx, and perltru64.</p>

<p>&middot; The Todo and Todo-5.6 files have been merged
into perltodo.</p>

<p>&middot; Use of the gprof tool to profile Perl has been
documented in perlhack. There is a make target
&quot;perl.gprof&quot; for generating a gprofiled Perl
executable.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements New Or
Improved Platforms &middot; AIX should now work better with
gcc, threads, and 64-bitness. Also the long doubles support
in AIX should be better now. See perlaix.</p>

<p>&middot; AtheOS ( http://www.atheos.cx/ ) is a new
platform.</p>

<p>&middot; DG/UX platform now supports the 5.005-style
threads. See perldgux.</p>

<p>&middot; DYNIX/ptx platform (a.k.a. dynixptx) is
supported at or near osvers 4.5.2.</p>

<p>&middot; Several Mac OS (Classic) portability patches
have been applied. We hope to get a fully working port by
5.8.0. (The remaining problems relate to the changed IO
model of Perl.) See perlmacos.</p>

<p>&middot; Mac OS X (or Darwin) should now be able to
build Perl even on HFS+ filesystems. (The case-insensitivity
confused the Perl build process.)</p>

<p>&middot; NetWare from Novell is now supported. See
perlnetware.</p>

<p>&middot; The Amdahl UTS UNIX mainframe platform is now
supported.</p>

<p>Generic Improvements &middot; In AFS installations one
can configure the root of the AFS to be somewhere else than
the default /afs by using the Configure parameter
&quot;-Dafsroot=/some/where/else&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; The version of Berkeley DB used when the Perl
(and, presumably, the DB_File extension) was built is now
available as @Config{qw(db_version_major db_version_minor
db_version_patch)} from Perl and as
&quot;DB_VERSION_MAJOR_CFG DB_VERSION_MINOR_CFG
DB_VERSION_PATCH_CFG&quot; from C.</p>

<p>&middot; The Thread extension is now not built at all
under ithreads (&quot;Configure -Duseithreads&quot;) because
it wouldnt work anyway (the Thread extension requires being
Configured with &quot;-Duse5005threads&quot;).</p>

<p>&middot; The &quot;B::Deparse&quot; compiler backend has
been so significantly improved that almost the whole Perl
test suite passes after being deparsed. A make target has
been added to help in further testing: &quot;make
test.deparse&quot;.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes &middot; The autouse pragma didn t
work for Multi::Part::Function::Names.</p>

<p>&middot; The behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string
constants such as &quot;0x23&quot; was platform-dependent:
in some platforms that was seen as 35, in some as 0, in some
as a floating point number (dont ask). This was caused by
Perl using the operating system libraries in a situation
where the result of the string to number conversion is
undefined: now Perl consistently handles such strings as
zero in numeric contexts.</p>

<p>&middot; dprofpp -R didnt work.</p>

<p>&middot; PERL5OPT with embedded spaces didnt work.</p>

<p>&middot; Sys::Syslog ignored the &quot;LOG_AUTH&quot;
constant.</p>

<p>Platform Specific Changes and Fixes &middot; Some
versions of glibc have a broken modfl(). This affects builds
with &quot;-Duselongdouble&quot;. This version of Perl
detects this brokenness and has a workaround for it. The
glibc release 2.2.2 is known to have fixed the modfl()
bug.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics &middot; In the regular
expression diagnostics the &quot;&lt;&lt; HERE&quot; marker
introduced in 5.7.0 has been changed to be &quot;&lt;--
HERE&quot; since too many people found the
&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; to be too similar to here-document
starters.</p>

<p>&middot; If you try to &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc a
number less than 0 or larger than 255 using the
&quot;C&quot; format you will get an optional warning.
Similarly for the &quot;c&quot; format and a number less
than -128 or more than 127.</p>

<p>&middot; Certain regex modifiers such as
&quot;(?o)&quot; make sense only if applied to the entire
regex. You will an optional warning if you try to do
otherwise.</p>

<p>&middot; Using arrays or hashes as references (e.g.
&quot;%foo-&gt;{bar}&quot; has been deprecated for a while.
Now you will get an optional warning.</p>

<p>Source Code Enhancements MAGIC constants The MAGIC
constants (e.g. &rsquo;P&rsquo;) have been macrofied (e.g.
&quot;PERL_MAGIC_TIED&quot;) for better source code
readability and maintainability.</p>

<p>Better commented code perly.c, sv.c, and sv.h have now
been extensively commented.</p>

<p>Regex pre-/post-compilation items matched up The regex
compiler now maintains a structure that identifies nodes in
the compiled bytecode with the corresponding syntactic
features of the original regex expression. The information
is attached to the new &quot;offsets&quot; member of the
&quot;struct regexp&quot;. See perldebguts for more complete
information.</p>

<p>gcc -Wall The C code has been made much more &quot;gcc
-Wall&quot; clean. Some warning messages still remain,
though, so if you are compiling with gcc you will see some
warnings about dubious practices. The warnings are being
worked on.</p>

<p>New Tests Several new tests have been added, especially
for the lib subsection.</p>

<p>The tests are now reported in a different order than in
earlier Perls. (This happens because the test scripts from
under t/lib have been moved to be closer to the
library/extension they are testing.)</p>

<p>Known Problems Note that unlike other sections in this
document (which describe changes since 5.7.0) this section
is cumulative containing known problems for all the 5.7
releases.</p>

<p>AIX &middot; In AIX 4.2 Perl extensions that use C++
functions that use statics may have problems in that the
statics are not getting initialized. In newer AIX releases
this has been solved by linking Perl with the libC_r
library, but unfortunately in AIX 4.2 the said library has
an obscure bug where the various functions related to time
(such as time() and gettimeofday()) return broken values,
and therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is not linked against the
libC_r.</p>

<p>&middot; vac 5.0.0.0 May Produce Buggy Code For Perl</p>

<p>The AIX C compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy
code, resulting in few random tests failing, but when the
failing tests are run by hand, they succeed. We suggest
upgrading to at least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been
known to compile Perl correctly. &quot;lslpp -L|grep
vac.C&quot; will tell you the vac version.</p>

<p>Amiga Perl Invoking Mystery One cannot call Perl using
the &quot;volume:&quot; syntax, that is, &quot;perl -v&quot;
works, but for example &quot;bin:perl -v&quot; doesnt. The
exact reason is known but the current suspect is the ixemul
library.</p>

<p>lib/ftmp-security tests warnsystem possibly insecure
Dont panic. Read INSTALL make test section instead.</p>

<p>Cygwin intermittent failures of
lib/Memoize/t/expire_file 11 and 12 The subtests 11 and 12
sometimes fail and sometimes work.</p>

<p>HP-UX lib/io_multihomed Fails When LP64-Configured The
lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has been
configured to be 64-bit. Because other 64-bit platforms do
not hang in this test, HP-UX is suspect. All other tests
pass in 64-bit HP-UX. The test attempts to create and
connect to &quot;multihomed&quot; sockets (sockets which
have multiple IP addresses).</p>

<p>HP-UX lib/posix Subtest 9 Fails When LP64-Configured If
perl is configured with -Duse64bitall, the successful result
of the subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the
successful result of the subtest 9, which confuses the test
harness so much that it thinks the subtest 9 failed.</p>

<p>Linux With Sfio Fails op/misc Test 48 No known fix.</p>

<p>OS/390 OS/390 has rather many test failures but the
situation is actually better than it was in 5.6.0, its just
that so many new modules and tests have been added.</p>

<p>op/sprintf tests 129 and 130 The op/sprintf tests 129
and 130 are known to fail on some platforms. Examples
include any platform using sfio, and Compaq/Tandems NonStop-
UX. The failing platforms do not comply with the ANSI C
Standard, line 19ff on page 134 of ANSI X3.159 1989 to be
exact. (They produce something other than &quot;1&quot; and
&quot;-1&quot; when formatting 0.6 and -0.6 using the printf
format &quot;%.0f&quot;, most often they produce
&quot;0&quot; and &quot;-0&quot;.)</p>

<p>Failure of Thread tests Note that support for
5.005-style threading remains experimental.</p>

<p>The following tests are known to fail due to fundamental
problems in the 5.005 threading implementation. These are
not new failures--Perl 5.005_0x has the same bugs, but didnt
have these tests.</p>

<p>lib/autouse.t 4 t/lib/thr5005.t 19-20</p>

<p>UNICOS &middot; ext/POSIX/sigaction subtests 6 and 13

28 failed, which is interesting since the test only has 27
tests.</p>

<p>These tests fail because of yet unresolved floating

<p>UTS There are a few known test failures, see
perluts.</p>

<p>VMS Rather many tests are failing in VMS but that
actually more tests succeed in VMS than they used to, its
just that there are many, many more tests than there used to
be.</p>

<p>Here are the known failures from some compiler/platform
combinations.</p>

<p>Win32 In multi-CPU boxes there are some problems with
the I/O buffering: some output may appear twice.</p>

<p>Localising a Tied Variable Leaks Memory use Tie::Hash;
tie my %tie_hash =&gt; &rsquo;Tie::StdHash&rsquo;;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>local($tie_hash{Foo}) = 1; # leaks</p>

<p>Code like the above is known to leak memory every time
the local() is executed.</p>

<p>Self-tying of Arrays and Hashes Is Forbidden Self-tying
of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to-
fix ways. As a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting
frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most
often) it is for now forbidden (you will get a fatal error
even from an attempt).</p>

<p>Variable Attributes are not Currently Usable for Tieing
This limitation will hopefully be fixed in future.
(Subroutine attributes work fine for tieing, see
Attribute::Handlers).</p>

<p>Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles Some
extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with
largefiles, a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file
offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported. Modules
may fail to compile at all or compile and work incorrectly.
Currently there is no good solution for the problem, but
Configure now provides appropriate non- largefile ccflags,
ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the %Config hash (e.g.,
$Config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are
having problems can try configuring themselves without the
largefileness. This is admittedly not a clean solution, and
the solution may not even work at all. One potential failure
is whether one can (or, if one can, whether it s a good
idea) link together at all binaries with different ideas
about file offsets, all this is platform-dependent.</p>

<p>The Compiler Suite Is Still Experimental The compiler
suite is slowly getting better but is nowhere near working
order yet.</p>

<p>The Long Double Support is Still Experimental The
ability to configure Perl s numbers to use &quot;long
doubles&quot;, floating point numbers of hopefully better
accuracy, is still experimental. The implementations of long
doubles are not yet widespread and the existing
implementations are not quite mature or standardised,
therefore trying to support them is a rare and moving
target. The gain of more precision may also be offset by
slowdown in computations (more bits to move around, and the
operations are more likely to be executed by less optimised
libraries).</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org/ There may also be information at
http://www.perl.com/perl/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team.</p>
