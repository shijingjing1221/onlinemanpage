<p>SETBUF(3) Linux Programmer s Manual SETBUF(3)</p>

<p>NAME setbuf, setbuffer, setlinebuf, setvbuf - stream
buffering operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>void setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);</p>

<p>void setbuffer(FILE *stream, char *buf, size_t
size);</p>

<p>void setlinebuf(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t
size);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>setbuffer(), setlinebuf(): _BSD_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The three types of buffering available are
unbuffered, block buffered, and line buffered. When an
output stream is unbuffered, information appears on the
destination file or terminal as soon as written; when it is
block buffered many characters are saved up and written as a
block; when it is line buffered characters are saved up
until a newline is output or input is read from any stream
attached to a terminal device (typically stdin). The
function fflush(3) may be used to force the block out early.
(See fclose(3).) Normally all files are block buffered. When
the first I/O operation occurs on a file, malloc(3) is
called, and a buffer is obtained. If a stream refers to a
terminal (as stdout normally does) it is line buffered. The
standard error stream stderr is always unbuffered by
default.</p>

<p>The setvbuf() function may be used on any open stream to
change its buffer. The mode argument must be one of the
following three macros:</p>

<p>_IONBF unbuffered</p>

<p>_IOLBF line buffered</p>

<p>_IOFBF fully buffered</p>

<p>Except for unbuffered files, the buf argument should
point to a buffer at least size bytes long; this buffer will
be used instead of the cur- rent buffer. If the argument buf
is NULL, only the mode is affected; a new buffer will be
allocated on the next read or write operation. The setvbuf()
function may only be used after opening a stream and before
any other operations have been performed on it.</p>

<p>The other three calls are, in effect, simply aliases for
calls to setvbuf(). The setbuf() function is exactly
equivalent to the call</p>

<p>setvbuf(stream, buf, buf ? _IOFBF : _IONBF, BUFSIZ);</p>

<p>The setbuffer() function is the same, except that the
size of the buffer is up to the caller, rather than being
determined by the default BUFSIZ. The setlinebuf() function
is exactly equivalent to the call:</p>

<p>setvbuf(stream, (char *) NULL, _IOLBF, 0);</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The function setvbuf() returns 0 on
success. It returns non-zero on failure (mode is invalid or
the request cannot be honored). It may set errno on
failure.</p>

<p>The other functions do not return a value.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The setbuf() and setvbuf() functions
conform to C89 and C99.</p>

<p>BUGS The setbuffer() and setlinebuf() functions are not
portable to versions of BSD before 4.2BSD, and are available
under Linux since libc 4.5.21. On 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD systems,
setbuf() always uses a suboptimal buffer size and should be
avoided.</p>

<p>You must make sure that the space that buf points to
still exists by the time stream is closed, which also
happens at program termination. For example, the following
is invalid:</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(void) { char buf[BUFSIZ]; setbuf(stdin, buf);
printf(&quot;Hello, world!0); return 0; }</p>

malloc(3), printf(3), puts(3)</p>
