<p>WCTOB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCTOB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wctob - wide-character to single-byte
conversion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wctob(wint_t c);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wctob() function shall determine whether
c corresponds to a member of the extended character set
whose character representation is a sin- gle byte when in
the initial shift state.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
LC_CTYPE cate- gory of the current locale.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wctob() function shall return EOF if c
does not correspond to a character with length one in the
initial shift state. Otherwise, it shall return the
single-byte representation of that character as an unsigned
char converted to int.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>
