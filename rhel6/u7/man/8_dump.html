<p>DUMP(8) System management commands DUMP(8)</p>

<p>NAME dump - ext2/3/4 filesystem backup</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dump [-level#] [-ackMnqSuv] [-A file] [-B
records] [-b blocksize] [-d density] [-D file] [-e inode
numbers] [-E file] [-f file] [-F script] [-h level] [-I nr
errors] [-jcompression level] [-L label] [-Q file] [-s feet]
[-T date] [-y] [-zcompression level] files-to-dump</p>

<p>dump [-W | -w]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Dump examines files on an ext2/3/4
filesystem and determines which files need to be backed up.
These files are copied to the given disk, tape or other
storage medium for safe keeping (see the -f option below for
doing remote backups). A dump that is larger than the output
medium is broken into multiple volumes. On most media the
size is determined by writing until an end-of-media
indication is returned.</p>

<p>On media that cannot reliably return an end-of-media
indication (such as some cartridge tape drives), each volume
is of a fixed size; the actual size is determined by
specifying cartridge media, or via the tape size, density
and/or block count options below. By default, the same
output file name is used for each volume after prompting the
oper- ator to change media.</p>

<p>files-to-dump is either a mountpoint of a filesystem or
a list of files and directories to be backed up as a subset
of a filesystem. In the former case, either the path to a
mounted filesystem or the device of an unmounted filesystem
can be used. In the latter case, certain restrictions are
placed on the backup: -u is not allowed, the only dump level
that is supported is 0 and all the files and directories
must reside on the same filesystem.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported by dump:</p>

<p>-level# The dump level (any integer). A level 0, full
backup, specified by -0 guarantees the entire file system is
copied (but see also the -h option below). A level number
above 0, incremental backup, tells dump to copy all files
new or modified since the last dump of a lower level. The
default level is 0. Historically only levels 0 to 9 were
usable in dump, this version is able to understand any
integer as a dump level.</p>

<p>-a auto-size. Bypass all tape length calculations, and
write until an end-of-media indication is returned. This
works best for most modern tape drives, and is the default.
Use of this option is particularly recommended when
appending to an existing tape, or using a tape drive with
hardware compression (where you can never be sure about the
compression ratio).</p>

<p>-A archive_file Archive a dump table-of-contents in the
specified archive_file to be used by restore(8) to determine
whether a file is in the dump file that is being
restored.</p>

<p>-b blocksize The number of kilobytes per dump record.
The default blocksize is 10, unless the -d option has been
used to specify a tape den- sity of 6250BPI or more, in
which case the default blocksize is 32. Th maximal value is
1024. Note however that, since the IO system slices all
requests into chunks of MAXBSIZE (which can be as low as
64kB), you can experience problems with dump(8) and
restore(8) when using a higher value, depending on your
kernel and/or libC versions.</p>

<p>-B records The number of 1 kB blocks per volume. Not
normally required, as dump can detect end-of-media. When the
specified size is reached, dump waits for you to change the
volume. This option overrides the calculation of tape size
based on length and den- sity. If compression is on this
limits the size of the com- pressed output per volume.
Multiple values may be given as a single argument separated
by commas. Each value will be used for one dump volume in
the order listed; if dump creates more volumes than the
number of values given, the last value will be used for the
remaining volumes. This is useful for filling up already
partially filled media (and then continuing with full size
volumes on empty media) or mixing media of different
sizes.</p>

<p>-c Change the defaults for use with a cartridge tape
drive, with a density of 8000 bpi, and a length of 1700
feet. Specifying a cartridge drive overrides the
end-of-media detection.</p>

<p>-d density Set tape density to density. The default is
1600BPI. Specifying a tape density overrides the
end-of-media detection.</p>

<p>-D file Set the path name of the file storing the
information about the previous full and incremental dumps.
The default location is /etc/dumpdates.</p>

<p>-e inodes Exclude inodes from the dump. The inodes
parameter is a comma separated list of inode numbers (you
can use stat(1) to find the inode number for a file or
directory).</p>

<p>-E file Read list of inodes to be excluded from the dump
from the text file file. The file file should be an ordinary
file containing inode numbers separated by newlines.</p>

<p>-f file Write the backup to file; file may be a special
device file like /dev/st0 (a tape drive), /dev/rsd1c (a
floppy disk drive), an ordinary file, or - (the standard
output). Multiple file names may be given as a single
argument separated by commas. Each file will be used for one
dump volume in the order listed; if the dump requires more
volumes than the number of names given, the last file name
will used for all remaining volumes after prompt- ing for
media changes. If the name of the file is of the form
host:file or user@host:file dump writes to the named file on
the remote host (which should already exist, dump doesn t
create a new remote file) using rmt(8). The default path
name of the remote rmt(8) program is /etc/rmt; this can be
overridden by the environment variable RMT.</p>

<p>-F script Run script at the end of each tape (except for
the last one). The device name and the current volume number
are passed on the command line. The script must return 0 if
dump should continue without asking the user to change the
tape, 1 if dump should continue but ask the user to change
the tape. Any other exit code will cause dump to abort. For
security reasons, dump reverts back to the real user ID and
the real group ID before running the script.</p>

<p>-h level Honor the user nodump flag UF_NODUMP only for
dumps at or above the given level. The default honor level
is 1, so that incre- mental backups omit such files but full
backups retain them.</p>

<p>-I nr errors By default, dump will ignore the first 32
read errors on the file system before asking for operator
intervention. You can change this using this flag to any
value. This is useful when running dump on an active
filesystem where read errors simply indicate an
inconsistency between the mapping and dumping passes.</p>

<p>A value of 0 means that all read errors will be
ignored.</p>

<p>-jcompression level Compress every block to be written
on the tape using bzlib library. This option will work only
when dumping to a file or pipe or, when dumping to a tape
drive, if the tape drive is capable of writing variable
length blocks. You will need at least the 0.4b24 version of
restore in order to extract com- pressed tapes. Tapes
written using compression will not be com- patible with the
BSD tape format. The (optional) parameter spec- ifies the
compression level bzlib will use. The default compres- sion
level is 2. If the optional parameter is specified, there
should be no white space between the option letter and the
parameter.</p>

<p>-k Use Kerberos authentication to talk to remote tape
servers. (Only available if this option was enabled when
dump was com- piled.)</p>

<p>-L label The user-supplied text string label is placed
into the dump header, where tools like restore(8) and
file(8) can access it. Note that this label is limited to be
at most LBLSIZE (currently 16) characters, which must
include the terminating .</p>

<p>-m If this flag is specified, dump will optimise the
output for inodes having been changed but not modified since
the last dump ( changed and modified have the meaning
defined in stat(2) ). For those inodes, dump will save only
the metadata, instead of saving the entire inode contents.
Inodes which are either directories or have been modified
since the last dump are saved in a regular way. Uses of this
flag must be consistent, meaning that either every dump in
an incremental dump set have the flag, or no one has it.</p>

<p>If you use this option, be aware that many programs that
unpack files from archives (e.g. tar, rpm, unzip, dpkg) may
set files mtimes to dates in the past. Files installed in
this way may not be dumped correctly using &quot;dump
-m&quot; if the modified mtime is earlier than the previous
level dump.</p>

<p>Tapes written using such metadata only inodes will not
be com- patible with the BSD tape format or older versions
of restore.</p>

<p>-M Enable the multi-volume feature. The name specified
with f is treated as a prefix and dump writes in sequence to
&lt;prefix&gt;001, &lt;prefix&gt;002 etc. This can be useful
when dumping to files on an ext2/3/4 partition, in order to
bypass the 2GB file size limita- tion.</p>

<p>-n Whenever dump requires operator attention, notify all
operators in the group operator by means similar to a
wall(1).</p>

<p>-q Make dump abort immediately whenever operator
attention is required, without prompting in case of write
errors, tape changes etc.</p>

<p>-Q file Enable the Quick File Access support. Tape
positions for each inode are stored into the file file which
is used by restore (if called with parameter -Q and the
filename) to directly position the tape at the file restore
is currently working on. This saves hours when restoring
single files from large backups, saves the tapes and the
drives head.</p>

<p>It is recommended to set up the st driver to return
logical tape positions rather than physical before calling
dump/restore with parameter -Q. Since not all tape devices
support physical tape positions those tape devices return an
error during dump/restore when the st driver is set to the
default physical setting. Please see the st(4) man page,
option MTSETDRVBUFFER , or the mt(1) man page, on how to set
the driver to return logical tape positions.</p>

<p>Before calling restore with parameter -Q, always make
sure the st driver is set to return the same type of tape
position used during the call to dump. Otherwise restore may
be confused.</p>

<p>This option can be used when dumping to local tapes (see
above) or to local files.</p>

<p>-s feet Attempt to calculate the amount of tape needed
at a particular density. If this amount is exceeded, dump
prompts for a new tape. It is recommended to be a bit
conservative on this option. The default tape length is 2300
feet. Specifying the tape size overrides end-of-media
detection.</p>

<p>-S Size estimate. Determine the amount of space that is
needed to perform the dump without actually doing it, and
display the estimated number of bytes it will take. This is
useful with incremental dumps to determine how many volumes
of media will be needed.</p>

<p>-T date Use the specified date as the starting time for
the dump instead of the time determined from looking in
/etc/dumpdates . The format of date is the same as that of
ctime(3) followed by an rfc822 timezone specification:
either a plus or minus sign fol- lowed by two digits for the
number of hours and two digits for the minutes. For example,
-0800 for eight hours west of Green- wich or +0230 for two
hours and a half east of Greenwich. This timezone offset
takes into account daylight savings time (if applicable to
the timezone): UTC offsets when daylight savings time is in
effect will be different than offsets when daylight savings
time is not in effect. For backward compatibility, if no
timezone is specified, a local time is assumed. This option
is useful for automated dump scripts that wish to dump over
a spe- cific period of time. The -T option is mutually
exclusive from the -u option.</p>

<p>-u Update the file /etc/dumpdates after a successful
dump. The for- mat of /etc/dumpdates is readable by people,
consisting of one free format record per line: filesystem
name, increment level and ctime(3) format dump date followed
by a rfc822 timezone specification (see the -u option for
details). If no timezone offset is specified, times are
interpreted as local. Whenever the file is written, all
dates in the file are converted to the local time zone,
without changing the UTC times. There may be only one entry
per filesystem at each level. The file /etc/dump- dates may
be edited to change any of the fields, if necessary.</p>

<p>-v The -v (verbose) makes dump to print extra
information which could be helpful in debug sessions.</p>

<p>-W Dump tells the operator what file systems need to be
dumped. This information is gleaned from the files
/etc/dumpdates and /etc/fstab. The -W option causes dump to
print out, for all file systems in /etc/dumpdates , and
recognized file systems in /etc/mtab and /etc/fstab. the
most recent dump date and level, and highlights those that
should be dumped. If the -W option is set, all other options
are ignored, and dump exits immediately.</p>

<p>-w Is like -W, but prints only recognized filesystems in
/etc/mtab and /etc/fstab which need to be dumped.</p>

<p>-y Compress every block to be written to the tape using
the lzo library. This doesnt compress as well as the zlib
library but its much faster. This option will work only when
dumping to a file or pipe or, when dumping to a tape drive,
if the tape drive is capable of writing variable length
blocks. You will need at least the 0.4b34 version of restore
in order to extract com- pressed tapes. Tapes written using
compression will not be com- patible with the BSD tape
format.</p>

<p>-zcompression level Compress every block to be written
on the tape using zlib library. This option will work only
when dumping to a file or pipe or, when dumping to a tape
drive, if the tape drive is capable of writing variable
length blocks. You will need at least the 0.4b22 version of
restore in order to extract com- pressed tapes. Tapes
written using compression will not be com- patible with the
BSD tape format. The (optional) parameter spec- ifies the
compression level zlib will use. The default compres- sion
level is 2. If the optional parameter is specified, there
should be no white space between the option letter and the
parameter.</p>

<p>Dump requires operator intervention on these conditions:
end of tape, end of dump, tape write error, tape open error
or disk read error (if there is more than a threshold of nr
errors). In addition to alerting all operators implied by
the -n key, dump interacts with the operator on dumps
control terminal at times when dump can no longer proceed,
or if something is grossly wrong. All questions dump poses
must be answered by typing yes or no, appropriately.</p>

<p>Since making a dump involves a lot of time and effort
for full dumps, dump checkpoints itself at the start of each
tape volume. If writing that volume fails for some reason,
dump will, with operator permission, restart itself from the
checkpoint after the old tape has been rewound and removed,
and a new tape has been mounted.</p>

<p>Dump tells the operator what is going on at periodic
intervals, includ- ing usually low estimates of the number
of blocks to write, the number of tapes it will take, the
time to completion, and the time to the tape change. The
output is verbose, so that others know that the terminal
controlling dump is busy, and will be for some time.</p>

<p>In the event of a catastrophic disk event, the time
required to restore all the necessary backup tapes or files
to disk can be kept to a mini- mum by staggering the
incremental dumps. An efficient method of stag- gering
incremental dumps to minimize the number of tapes
follows:</p>

<p>Always start with a level 0 backup, for example:
/sbin/dump -0u -f /dev/st0 /usr/src</p>

<p>This should be done at set intervals, say once a month
or once every two months, and on a set of fresh tapes that
is saved for- ever.</p>

<p>After a level 0, dumps of active file systems are taken
on a daily basis, with this sequence of dump levels: 3 2 5 4
7 6 9 8 9 9 ...</p>

<p>For the daily dumps, it should be possible to use a
fixed number of tapes for each day, used on a weekly basis.
Each week, a level 1 dump is taken, and the daily Hanoi
sequence repeats beginning with 3. For weekly dumps, another
fixed set of tapes per dumped file system is used, also on a
cyclical basis.</p>

<p>After several months or so, the daily and weekly tapes
should get rotated out of the dump cycle and fresh tapes
brought in.</p>

<p>Another backup strategy is the Tower of Hanoi sequence,
which reuses older tapes in a way that for newer dates the
available restore points are more frequent, then for older
dates (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme for
additional information).</p>

<p>(The 4.3BSD option syntax is implemented for backward
compatibility but is not documented here.)</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT TAPE If no -f option was specified, dump
will use the device speci- fied via TAPE as the dump device.
TAPE may be of the form tape- name, host:tapename, or
user@host:tapename.</p>

<p>RMT The environment variable RMT will be used to
determine the path- name of the remote rmt(8) program.</p>

<p>RSH Dump uses the contents of this variable to determine
the name of the remote shell command to use when doing
remote backups (rsh, ssh etc.). If this variable is not set,
rcmd(3) will be used, but only root will be able to do
remote backups.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/st0 default tape unit to dump to</p>

<p>/etc/dumpdates dump date records</p>

<p>/etc/fstab dump table: file systems and frequency</p>

<p>/etc/mtab dump table: mounted file systems</p>

<p>/etc/group to find group operator</p>

<p>SEE ALSO fstab(5), restore(8), rmt(8)</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Many, and verbose.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY The format of the /etc/dumpdates file has
changed in release 0.4b34, however, the file will be read
correctly with either pre-0.4b34 or 0.4b34 and later
versions of dump provided that the machine on which dump is
run did not change timezones (which should be a fairly rare
occurrence).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Dump exits with zero status on success.
Startup errors are indicated with an exit code of 1;
abnormal termination is indicated with an exit code of
3.</p>

<p>BUGS It might be considered a bug that this version of
dump can only handle ext2/3/4 filesystems. Specifically, it
does not work with FAT filesys- tems.</p>

<p>Fewer than 32 read errors (change this with -I) on the
filesystem are ignored. If noticing read errors is
important, the output from dump can be parsed to look for
lines that contain the text read error.</p>

<p>When a read error occurs, dump prints out the
corresponding physical disk block and sector number and the
ext2/3/4 logical block number. It doesn t print out the
corresponding file name or even the inode number. The user
has to use debugfs(8), commands ncheck and icheck to
translate the ext2blk number printed out by dump into an
inode number, then into a file name.</p>

<p>Each reel requires a new process, so parent processes
for reels already written just hang around until the entire
tape is written.</p>

<p>The estimated number of tapes is not correct if
compression is on.</p>

<p>It would be nice if dump knew about the dump sequence,
kept track of the tapes scribbled on, told the operator
which tape to mount when, and provided more assistance for
the operator running restore.</p>

<p>Dump cannot do remote backups without being run as root,
due to its security history. Presently, it works if you set
it setuid (like it used to be), but this might constitute a
security risk. Note that you can set RSH to use a remote
shell program instead.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The dump/restore backup suite was ported to
Linuxs Second Extended File System by Remy Card
&lt;card@Linux.EU.Org&gt;. He maintained the initial
versions of dump (up and including 0.4b4, released in
January 1997).</p>

<p>Starting with 0.4b5, the new maintainer is Stelian Pop
&lt;stelian@popies.net&gt;.</p>
