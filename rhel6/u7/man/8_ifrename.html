<p>NAME ifrename - rename network interfaces based on
various static criteria</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ifrename [-c configfile] [-p] [-d] [-u] [-v]
[-V] [-D] ifrename [-c configfile] [-i interface] [-n
newname]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ifrename is a tool allowing you to assign a
consistent name to each of your network interface.</p>

<p>By default, interface names are dynamic, and each
network interface is assigned the first available name
(eth0, eth1...). The order network interfaces are created
may vary. For built-in interfaces, the kernel boot time
enumeration may vary. For removable interface, the user may
plug them in any order.</p>

<p>Ifrename allow the user to decide what name a network
interface will have. Ifrename can use a variety of selectors
to specify how interface names match the network interfaces
on the system, the most common selector is the interface MAC
address.</p>

<p>Ifrename must be run before interfaces are brought up,
which is why its mostly useful in various scripts (init,
hotplug) but is seldom used directly by the user. By
default, ifrename renames all present system interfaces
using mappings defined in /etc/iftab.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS -c configfile Set the configuration file to
be used (by default /etc/iftab). The configuration file
define the mapping between selectors and interface names,
and is described in iftab(5). If configfile is
&quot;-&quot;, the configuration is read from stdin.</p>

<p>-p Probe (load) kernel modules before renaming
interfaces. By default ifrename only check interfaces
already loaded, and doesn t auto-load the required kernel
modules. This option enables smooth integration with system
not loading modules before calling ifrename.</p>

<p>-d Enable various Debian specific hacks. Combined with
-p, only modules for interfaces specified in
/etc/network/interface are loaded.</p>

<p>-i interface Only rename the specified interface as
opposed to all interfaces on the system. The new interface
name is printed.</p>

<p>-n newname When used with -i, specify the new name of
the interface. The list of mappings from the configuration
file is bypassed, the interface specified with -i is renamed
directly to newname. The new name may be a wildcard
containing a single *. When used without -i, rename
interfaces by using only mappings that would rename them to
newname. The new name may not be a wildcard. This use of
ifrename is discouraged, because ineffi- cient (-n without
-i). All the interfaces of the system need to be processed
at each invocation, therefore in most case it is not faster
than just letting ifrename renaming all of them (without
both -n and -i).</p>

<p>-t Enable name takeover support. This allow interface
name swapping between two or more interfaces. Takeover
enable an interface to steal the name of another interface.
This works only with kernel 2.6.X and if the other interface
is down. Consequently, this is not compatible with Hotplug.
The other interface is assigned a random name, but may be
renamed later with ifrename. The number of takeovers is
limited to avoid circular loops, and therefore some complex
multi-way name swapping situations may not be fully
processed. In any case, name swapping and the use of this
feature is dis- couraged, and you are invited to choose
unique and unambiguous names for your interfaces...</p>

<p>-u Enable udev output mode. This enables proper
integration of ifrename in the udev framework, udevd(8) will
use ifrename to assign interface names present in
/etc/iftab. In this mode the output of ifrename can be
parsed directly by udevd(8) as an IMPORT action. This
requires udev version 107 or later.</p>

<p>-D Dry-run mode. Ifrename wont change any interface, it
will only print new interface name, if applicable, and
return. In dry-run mode, interface name wildcards are not
resolved. New interface name is printed, even if it is the
same as the old name. Be also aware that some selectors can
only be read by root, for example those based on ethtool),
and will fail silently if run by a normal user. In other
words, dry-run mode under a standard user may not give the
expected result.</p>

<p>-V Verbose mode. Ifrename will display internal results
of parsing its configuration file and querying the
interfaces selectors. Combined with the dry-run option, this
is a good way to debug complex configurations or trivial
problems.</p>
