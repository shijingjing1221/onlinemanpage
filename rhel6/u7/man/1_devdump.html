<p>ISOINFO(1) ISOINFO(1)</p>

<p>NAME devdump, isoinfo, isovfy, isodump - Utility
programs for dumping and verifying iso9660 images.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS devdump isoimage</p>

<p>isodump isoimage</p>

<p>isoinfo [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -R ] [ -J ] [ -j charset ] [ -f
] [ -l ] [ -p ] [ -T sector ] [ -N sector ] [ -i isoimage ]
[ -x path ]</p>

<p>isovfy isoimage</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION devdump is a crude utility to interactively
display the contents of device or filesystem images. The
initial screen is a display of the first 256 bytes of the
first 2048 byte sector. The commands are the same as with
isodump.</p>

<p>isodump is a crude utility to interactively display the
contents of iso9660 images in order to verify directory
integrity. The initial screen is a display of the first part
of the root directory, and the prompt shows you the extent
number and offset in the extent.</p>

<p>You can use the a and b commands to move backwards and
for- wards within the image. The g command allows you to
goto an arbitrary extent, and the f command specifies a
search string to be used. The + command searches forward for
the next instance of the search string, and the q command
exits devdump or isodump.</p>

<p>isoinfo is a utility to perform directory like listings
of iso9660 images.</p>

<p>isovfy is a utility to verify the integrity of an
iso9660 image. Most of the tests in isovfy were added after
bugs were discovered in early versions of genisoimage. It
isnt all that clear how useful this is anymore, but it
doesnt hurt to have this around.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The options common to all programs are
-help,-h,-version, i=name,dev=name. The isoinfo program has
additional command line options. The options are:</p>

<p>-help</p>

<p>-h print a summary of all options.</p>

<p>-d Print information from the primary volume descriptor
(PVD) of the iso9660 image. This includes information about
Rock Ridge, Joliet extensions and Eltorito boot information
if present.</p>

<p>-f generate output as if a find . -print command had
been run on the iso9660 image. You should not use the -l
image with the -f option.</p>

<p>-i iso_image Specifies the path of the iso9660 image
that we wish to examine. The options -i and dev=target are
mutual exclusive.</p>

<p>dev=target Sets the SCSI target for the drive, see notes
above. A typical device specification is dev=6,0 . If a
filename must be pro- vided together with the numerical
target specification, the filename is implementation
specific. The correct filename in this case can be found in
the system specific manuals of the target operating system.
On a FreeBSD system without CAM sup- port, you need to use
the control device (e.g. /dev/rcd0.ctl). A correct device
specification in this case may be dev=/dev/rcd0.ctl:@ .</p>

<p>On Linux, drives connected to a parallel port adapter
are mapped to a virtual SCSI bus. Different adapters are
mapped to differ- ent targets on this virtual SCSI bus.</p>

<p>If no dev option is present, the program will try to get
the device from the CDR_DEVICE environment.</p>

<p>If the argument to the dev= option does not contain the
charac- ters ,, /, @ or :, it is interpreted as an label
name that may be found in the file /etc/wodim.conf (see
FILES sec- tion).</p>

<p>The options -i and dev=target are mutual exclusive.</p>

<p>-l generate output as if a ls -lR command had been run
on the iso9660 image. You should not use the -f image with
the -l option.</p>

<p>-N sector Quick hack to help examine single session disc
files that are to be written to a multi-session disc. The
sector number specified is the sector number at which the
iso9660 image should be writ- ten when send to the
cd-writer. Not used for the first session on the disc.</p>

<p>-p Print path table information.</p>

<p>-R Extract information from Rock Ridge extensions (if
present) for permissions, file names and ownerships.</p>

<p>-J Extract information from Joliet extensions (if
present) for file names.</p>

<p>-j charset Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the
supplied charset. See genisoimage(8) for details.</p>

<p>-T sector Quick hack to help examine multi-session
images that have already been burned to a multi-session
disc. The sector number specified is the sector number for
the start of the session we wish to display.</p>

<p>-x pathname Extract specified file to stdout.</p>

<p>This manpage describes the program implementation of
isoinfo as shipped by the cdrkit distribution. See
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/deb- burn/ for details. It
is a spinoff from the original program dis- tributed in the
cdrtools package [1]. However, the cdrtools developers are
not involved in the development of this spinoff and
therefore shall not be made responsible for any problem
caused by it. Do not try to get support for this program by
contacting the original author(s).</p>

<p>If you have support questions, send them to</p>

<p>debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</p>

<p>If you have definitely found a bug, send a mail to this
list or to</p>

<p>submit@bugs.debian.org</p>

<p>writing at least a short description into the Subject
and &quot;Package: cdrkit&quot; into the first line of the
mail body.</p>

<p>BUGS The user interface really sucks.</p>

<p>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS These utilities are really quick
hacks, which are very useful for debugging problems in
genisoimage or in an iso9660 filesystem. In the long run, it
would be nice to have a daemon that would NFS export a
iso9660 image.</p>

<p>The isoinfo program is probably the program that is of
the most use to the general user.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY These utilities come with the cdrkit
package, and the primary download site is
http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/ and FTP mirrors of
distribu- tions. Despite the name, the software is not
beta.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT CDR_DEVICE This may either hold a device
identifier that is suitable to the open call of the SCSI
transport library or a label in the file
/etc/wodim.conf.</p>

<p>RSH If the RSH environment is present, the remote
connection will not be created via rcmd(3) but by calling
the program pointed to by RSH. Use e.g. RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to
create a secure shell connection.</p>

<p>Note that this forces the program to create a pipe to
the rsh(1) program and disallows the program to directly
access the network socket to the remote server. This makes
it impossible to set up performance parameters and slows
down the connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3)
connection.</p>

<p>RSCSI If the RSCSI environment is present, the remote
SCSI server will not be the program /opt/schily/sbin/rscsi
but the program pointed to by RSCSI. Note that the remote
SCSI server program name will be ignored if you log in using
an account that has been created with a remote SCSI server
program as login shell.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/wodim.conf Default values can be set for the
following options in /etc/wodim.conf.</p>

<p>CDR_DEVICE This may either hold a device identifier that
is suitable to the open call of the SCSI transport library
or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf that allows to
identify a specific drive on the system.</p>

<p>Any other label is an identifier for a specific drive on
the system. Such an identifier may not contain the
characters ,, /, @ or :.</p>

<p>Each line that follows a label contains a TAB separated
list of items. Currently, four items are recognized: the
SCSI ID of the drive, the default speed that should be used
for this drive, the default FIFO size that should be used
for this drive and drive specific options. The val- ues for
speed and fifosize may be set to -1 to tell the program to
use the global defaults. The value for driveropts may be set
to &quot;&quot; if no driveropts are used. A typical line
may look this way:</p>

<p>teac1= 0,5,0 4 8m &quot;&quot;</p>

<p>yamaha= 1,6,0 -1 -1 burnfree</p>

<p>This tells the program that a drive named teac1 is at
scsibus 0, target 5, lun 0 and should be used with speed 4
and a FIFO size of 8 MB. A second drive may be found at
scsibus 1, target 6, lun 0 and uses the default speed and
the default FIFO size.</p>
