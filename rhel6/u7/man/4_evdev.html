<p>DESCRIPTION evdev is an Xorg input driver for
Linux&acute;s generic event devices. It therefore supports
all input devices that the kernel knows about, including
most mice, keyboards, tablets and touchscreens. evdev is the
default driver on the major Linux distributions.</p>

<p>The evdev driver can serve as both a pointer and a
keyboard input device. Multiple input devices are supported
by multiple instances of this driver, with one InputDevice
section of your xorg.conf for each input device that will
use this driver.</p>

<p>It is recommended that evdev devices are configured
through the Input- Class directive (refer to xorg.conf(5))
instead of manual per-device configuration. Devices
configured in the xorg.conf(5) are not hot-plug capable.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE In general, any input device that the
kernel has a driver for can be accessed through the evdev
driver. See the Linux kernel documentation for a complete
list.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;ButtonMapping&quot; &quot;string&quot; Sets
the button mapping for this device. The mapping is a space-
separated list of button mappings that correspond in order
to the physical buttons on the device (i.e. the first number
is the mapping for button 1, etc.). The default mapping is
&quot;1 2 3 ... 32&quot;. A mapping of 0 deactivates the
button. Multiple buttons can have the same mapping. For
example, a left-handed mouse with deactivated scroll-wheel
would use a mapping of &quot;3 2 1 0 0&quot;. Invalid
mappings are ignored and the default mapping is used.
Buttons not specified in the users mapping use the default
map- ping.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specifies
the device through which the device can be accessed. This
will generally be of the form &quot;/dev/input/eventX&quot;,
where X is some integer. The mapping from device node to
hardware is system-dependent. Property: &quot;Device
Node&quot; (read-only).</p>

<p>Option &quot;DragLockButtons&quot; &quot;L1 B2 L3
B4&quot; Sets &quot;drag lock buttons&quot; that simulate
holding a button down, so that low dexterity people do not
have to hold a button down at the same time they move a
mouse cursor. Button numbers occur in pairs, with the lock
button number occurring first, followed by the button number
that is the target of the lock button. Prop- erty:
&quot;Evdev Drag Lock Buttons&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DragLockButtons&quot; &quot;M1&quot; Sets a
&quot;master drag lock button&quot; that acts as a
&quot;Meta Key&quot; indi- cating that the next button
pressed is to be &quot;drag locked&quot;. Property:
&quot;Evdev Drag Lock Buttons&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Emulate3Buttons&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable/disable the emulation of the third (middle) mouse
button for mice which only have two physical buttons. The
third button is emulated by pressing both buttons
simultaneously. Default: off for touchscreens, otherwise on
until a middle mouse button event is registered. Prop- erty:
&quot;Evdev Middle Button Emulation&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Emulate3Timeout&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) that the driver waits
before deciding if two buttons where pressed
&quot;simultane- ously&quot; when 3 button emulation is
enabled. Default: 50. Property: &quot;Evdev Middle Button
Timeout&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateWheel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable/disable &quot;wheel&quot; emulation. Wheel emulation
means emulating button press/release events when the mouse
is moved while a specific real button is pressed. Wheel
button events (typically buttons 4 and 5) are usually used
for scrolling. Wheel emulation is useful for get- ting
wheel-like behaviour with trackballs. It can also be useful
for mice with 4 or more buttons but no wheel. See the
description of the EmulateWheelButton, Emulate-
WheelInertia, EmulateWheelTimeout, XAxisMapping, and YAx-
isMapping options. Default: off. Property &quot;Evdev Wheel
Emulation&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateWheelButton&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Specifies which button must be held down
to enable wheel emulation mode. While this button is down, X
and/or Y pointer movement will generate button press/release
events as specified for the XAxisMapping and YAxisMapping
settings. If the button is 0 and EmulateWheel is on, any
motion of the device is converted into wheel events.
Default: 4. Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation
Button&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateWheelInertia&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Specifies how far (in pixels) the
pointer must move to generate button press/release events in
wheel emulation mode. Default: 10. Property: &quot;Evdev
Wheel Emulation Inertia&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateWheelTimeout&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Specifies the time in milliseconds the
EmulateWheelButton must be pressed before wheel emulation is
started. If the EmulateWheelButton is released before this
timeout, the original button press/release event is sent.
Default: 200. Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation
Timeout&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateThirdButton&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; Enable third button emulation. Third
button emulation emits a right button event (by default) by
pressing and holding the first button. The first button must
be held down for the configured timeout and must not move
more than the configured threshold for the emulation to
acti- vate. Otherwise, the first button event is posted as
nor- mal. Default: off. Property: &quot;Evdev Third Button
Emula- tion&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateThirdButtonTimeout&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Specifies the timeout in milliseconds
between the initial button press and the generation of the
emulated button event. Default: 1000. Property: &quot;Evdev
Third Button Emu- lation Timeout&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateThirdButtonButton&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Specifies the physical button number to
be emitted if third button emulation is triggered. Default:
3. Prop- erty: &quot;Evdev Third Button Button&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EmulateThirdButtonMoveThreshold&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Specifies the maximum move fuzz in
device coordinates for third button emulation. If the device
moves by more than this threshold before the third button
emulation is trig- gered, the emulation is cancelled and a
first button event is generated as normal. Default: 20.
Property: &quot;Evdev Third Button Emulation
Threshold&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;GrabDevice&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Force
a grab on the event device. Doing so will ensure that no
other driver can initialise the same device and it will also
stop the device from sending events to /dev/kbd or
/dev/input/mice. Events from this device will not be sent to
virtual devices (e.g. rfkill or the Macin- tosh mouse button
emulation). Default: disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;InvertX&quot; &quot;Bool&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;InvertY&quot; &quot;Bool&quot; Invert the
given axis. Default: off. Property: &quot;Evdev Axis
Inversion&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;IgnoreRelativeAxes&quot;
&quot;Bool&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;IgnoreAbsoluteAxes&quot; &quot;Bool&quot;
Ignore the specified type of axis. Default: unset. The X
server cannot deal with devices that have both relative and
absolute axes. Evdev tries to guess wich axes to ignore
given the device type and disables absolute axes for mice
and relative axes for tablets, touchscreens and touchpad.
These options allow to forcibly disable an axis type. Mouse
wheel axes are exempt and will work even if relative axes
are ignored. No property, this configura- tion must be set
in the configuration. If either option is set to False, the
driver will not ignore the specified axes regardless of the
presence of other axes. This may trigger buggy behavior and
events from this axis are always forwarded. Users are
discour- aged from setting this option.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Calibration&quot; &quot;min-x max-x min-y
max-y&quot; Calibrates the X and Y axes for devices that
need to scale to a different coordinate system than reported
to the X server. This feature is required for devices that
need to scale to a different coordinate system than orig-
inally reported by the kernel (e.g. touchscreens). The
scaling to the custom coordinate system is done in-driver
and the X server is unaware of the transformation. Property:
&quot;Evdev Axis Calibration&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Mode&quot;
&quot;Relative&quot;|&quot;Absolute&quot; Sets the mode of
the device if device has absolute axes. The default value
for touchpads is relative, for other absolute. This option
has no effect on devices without absolute axes.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SwapAxes&quot; &quot;Bool&quot; Swap x/y
axes. Default: off. Property: &quot;Evdev Axes
Swap&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XAxisMapping&quot; &quot;N1 N2&quot;
Specifies which buttons are mapped to motion in the X
direction in wheel emulation mode. Button number N1 is
mapped to the negative X axis motion and button number N2 is
mapped to the positive X axis motion. Default: no mapping.
Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation Axes&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;YAxisMapping&quot; &quot;N1 N2&quot;
Specifies which buttons are mapped to motion in the Y
direction in wheel emulation mode. Button number N1 is
mapped to the negative Y axis motion and button number N2 is
mapped to the positive Y axis motion. Default: &quot;4
5&quot;. Property: &quot;Evdev Wheel Emulation
Axes&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TypeName&quot; &quot;type&quot;&quot;
Specify the X Input 1.x type (see XListInputDevices(3)).
There is rarely a need to use this option, evdev will guess
the device type based on the device s capabilities. This
option is provided for devices that need quirks.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VertScrollDelta&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
The amount of motion considered one unit of scrolling
vertically. Default: &quot;1&quot;. Property: &quot;Evdev
Scrolling Distance&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;HorizScrollDelta&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
The amount of motion considered one unit of scrolling
horizontally. Default: &quot;1&quot;. Property: &quot;Evdev
Scrolling Distance&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DialDelta&quot; &quot;integer&quot; The
amount of motion considered one unit of turning the dial.
Default: &quot;1&quot;. Property: &quot;Evdev Scrolling Dis-
tance&quot;.</p>
