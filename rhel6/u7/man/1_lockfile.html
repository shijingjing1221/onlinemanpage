<p>LOCKFILE(1) LOCKFILE(1)</p>

<p>NAME lockfile - conditional semaphore-file creator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lockfile -sleeptime | -r retries | -l
locktimeout | -s suspend | -! | -ml | -mu | filename ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lockfile can be used to create one or more
semaphore files. If lock- file cant create all the specified
files (in the specified order), it waits sleeptime (defaults
to 8) seconds and retries the last file that didnt succeed.
You can specify the number of retries to do until failure is
returned. If the number of retries is -1 (default, i.e.,
-r-1) lockfile will retry forever.</p>

<p>If the number of retries expires before all files have
been created, lockfile returns failure and removes all the
files it created up till that point.</p>

<p>Using lockfile as the condition of a loop in a shell
script can be done easily by using the -! flag to invert the
exit status. To prevent infinite loops, failures for any
reason other than the lockfile already existing are not
inverted to success but rather are still returned as
failures.</p>

<p>All flags can be specified anywhere on the command line,
they will be processed when encountered. The command line is
simply parsed from left to right.</p>

<p>All files created by lockfile will be read-only, and
therefore will have to be removed with rm -f.</p>

<p>If you specify a locktimeout then a lockfile will be
removed by force after locktimeout seconds have passed since
the lockfile was last modi- fied/created (most likely by
some other program that unexpectedly died a long time ago,
and hence could not clean up any leftover lockfiles).
Lockfile is clock skew immune. After a lockfile has been
removed by force, a suspension of suspend seconds (defaults
to 16) is taken into account, in order to prevent the
inadvertent immediate removal of any newly created lockfile
by another program (compare SUSPEND in proc- mail(1)).</p>

<p>Mailbox locks If the permissions on the system mail
spool directory allow it, or if lockfile is suitably setgid,
it will be able to lock and unlock your system mailbox by
using the options -ml and -mu respectively.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Suppose you want to make sure that access to
the file &quot;important&quot; is serialised, i.e., no more
than one program or shell script should be allowed to access
it. For simplicitys sake, lets suppose that it is a shell
script. In this case you could solve it like this: ...
lockfile important.lock ...
access_&quot;important&quot;_to_your_hearts_content ... rm
-f important.lock ... Now if all the scripts that access
&quot;important&quot; follow this guideline, you will be
assured that at most one script will be executing between
the lockfile and the rm commands.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT LOGNAME used as a hint to determine the
invokers login- name</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd to verify and/or correct the invokers
loginname (and to find out his HOME directory, if
needed)</p>

<p>/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME.lock lockfile for the system
mailbox, the environment variables present in here will not
be taken from the environment, but will be determined by
look- ing in /etc/passwd</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rm(1), mail(1), binmail(1), sendmail(8),
procmail(1)</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Filename too long, ... Use shorter
filenames.</p>

<p>Forced unlock denied on &quot;x&quot; No write
permission in the directory where lock- file &quot;x&quot;
resides, or more than one lockfile try- ing to force a lock
at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>Forcing lock on &quot;x&quot; Lockfile &quot;x&quot; is
going to be removed by force be- cause of a timeout (compare
LOCKTIMEOUT in proc- mail(1)).</p>

<p>Out of memory, ... The system is out of swap space.</p>

<p>Signal received, ... Lockfile will remove anything it
created till now and terminate.</p>

<p>Sorry, ... The retries limit has been reached.</p>

<p>Truncating &quot;x&quot; and retrying lock &quot;x&quot;
does not seem to be a valid filename.</p>

<p>Try praying, ... Missing subdirectories or insufficient
privi- leges.</p>

<p>BUGS Definitely less than one.</p>

<p>WARNINGS The behavior of the -! flag, while useful, is
not necessarily intu- itive or consistent. When testing
lockfile s return value, shell script writers should
consider carefully whether they want to use the -! flag,
simply reverse the test, or do a switch on the exact exit-
code. In general, the -! flag should only be used when
lockfile is the conditional of a loop.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS Lockfile is NFS-resistant and eight-bit
clean.</p>

<p>NOTES Calling up lockfile with the -h or -? options will
cause it to display a command-line help page. Calling it up
with the -v option will cause it to display its version
information.</p>

<p>Multiple -! flags will toggle the return status.</p>

<p>Since flags can occur anywhere on the command line, any
filename start- ing with a - has to be preceded by ./.</p>

<p>The number of retries will not be reset when any
following file is be- ing created (i.e., they are simply
used up). It can, however, be reset by specifying
-rnewretries after every file on the command line.</p>

<p>Although files with any name can be used as lockfiles,
it is common practice to use the extension .lock to lock
mailfolders (it is ap- pended to the mailfolder name). In
case one does not want to have to worry about too long
filenames and does not have to conform to any oth- er
lockfilename convention, then an excellent way to generate a
lock- filename corresponding to some already existing file
is by taking the prefix lock. and appending the i-node
number of the file which is to be locked.</p>
