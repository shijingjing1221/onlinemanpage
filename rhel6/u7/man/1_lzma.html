<p>XZ(1) XZ Utils XZ(1)</p>

<p>NAME xz, unxz, xzcat, lzma, unlzma, lzcat - Compress or
decompress .xz and .lzma files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xz [option]... [file]...</p>

<p>unxz is equivalent to xz --decompress. xzcat is
equivalent to xz --decompress --stdout. lzma is equivalent
to xz --format=lzma. unlzma is equivalent to xz
--format=lzma --decompress. lzcat is equivalent to xz
--format=lzma --decompress --stdout.</p>

<p>When writing scripts that need to decompress files, it
is recommended to always use the name xz with appropriate
arguments (xz -d or xz -dc) instead of the names unxz and
xzcat.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xz is a general-purpose data compression
tool with command line syntax similar to gzip(1) and
bzip2(1). The native file format is the .xz format, but also
the legacy .lzma format and raw compressed streams with no
container format headers are supported.</p>

<p>xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the
selected oper- ation mode. If no files are given or file is
-, xz reads from standard input and writes the processed
data to standard output. xz will refuse (display an error
and skip the file) to write compressed data to stan- dard
output if it is a terminal. Similarly, xz will refuse to
read com- pressed data from standard input if it is a
terminal.</p>

<p>Unless --stdout is specified, files other than - are
written to a new file whose name is derived from the source
file name:</p>

<p>&middot; When compressing, the suffix of the target file
format (.xz or .lzma) is appended to the source filename to
get the target file- name.</p>

<p>&middot; When decompressing, the .xz or .lzma suffix is
removed from the filename to get the target filename. xz
also recognizes the suf- fixes .txz and .tlz, and replaces
them with the .tar suffix.</p>

<p>If the target file already exists, an error is displayed
and the file is skipped.</p>

<p>Unless writing to standard output, xz will display a
warning and skip the file if any of the following
applies:</p>

<p>&middot; File is not a regular file. Symbolic links are
not followed, thus they are never considered to be regular
files.</p>

<p>&middot; File has more than one hardlink.</p>

<p>&middot; File has setuid, setgid, or sticky bit set.</p>

<p>&middot; The operation mode is set to compress, and the
file already has a suffix of the target file format (.xz or
.txz when compressing to the .xz format, and .lzma or .tlz
when compressing to the .lzma for- mat).</p>

<p>&middot; The operation mode is set to decompress, and
the file doesnt have a suffix of any of the supported file
formats (.xz, .txz, .lzma, or .tlz).</p>

<p>After successfully compressing or decompressing the
file, xz copies the owner, group, permissions, access time,
and modification time from the source file to the target
file. If copying the group fails, the permis- sions are
modified so that the target file doesnt become accessible to
users who didnt have permission to access the source file.
xz doesnt support copying other metadata like access control
lists or extended attributes yet.</p>

<p>Once the target file has been successfully closed, the
source file is removed unless --keep was specified. The
source file is never removed if the output is written to
standard output.</p>

<p>Sending SIGINFO or SIGUSR1 to the xz process makes it
print progress information to standard error. This has only
limited use since when standard error is a terminal, using
--verbose will display an automati- cally updating progress
indicator.</p>

<p>Memory usage The memory usage of xz varies from a few
hundred kilobytes to several gigabytes depending on the
compression settings. The settings used when compressing a
file affect also the memory usage of the decompressor.
Typically the decompressor needs only 5 % to 20 % of the
amount of RAM that the compressor needed when creating the
file. Still, the worst- case memory usage of the
decompressor is several gigabytes.</p>

<p>To prevent uncomfortable surprises caused by huge memory
usage, xz has a built-in memory usage limiter. The default
limit is 40 % of total physical RAM. While operating systems
provide ways to limit the memory usage of processes, relying
on it wasn t deemed to be flexible enough.</p>

<p>When compressing, if the selected compression settings
exceed the mem- ory usage limit, the settings are
automatically adjusted downwards and a notice about this is
displayed. As an exception, if the memory usage limit is
exceeded when compressing with --format=raw, an error is
dis- played and xz will exit with exit status 1.</p>

<p>If source file cannot be decompressed without exceeding
the memory usage limit, an error message is displayed and
the file is skipped. Note that compressed files may contain
many blocks, which may have been compressed with different
settings. Typically all blocks will have roughly the same
memory requirements, but it is possible that a block later
in the file will exceed the memory usage limit, and an error
about too low memory usage limit gets displayed after some
data has already been decompressed.</p>

<p>The absolute value of the active memory usage limit can
be seen near the bottom of the output of --long-help. The
default limit can be overriden with --memory=limit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Integer suffixes and special values In most
places where an integer argument is expected, an optional
suf- fix is supported to easily indicate large integers.
There must be no space between the integer and the
suffix.</p>

<p>k or kB The integer is multiplied by 1,000 (10^3). For
example, 5k or 5kB equals 5000.</p>

<p>Ki or KiB The integer is multiplied by 1,024 (2^10).</p>

<p>M or MB The integer is multiplied by 1,000,000
(10^6).</p>

<p>Mi or MiB The integer is multiplied by 1,048,576
(2^20).</p>

<p>G or GB The integer is multiplied by 1,000,000,000
(10^9).</p>

<p>Gi or GiB The integer is multiplied by 1,073,741,824
(2^30).</p>

<p>A special value max can be used to indicate the maximum
integer value supported by the option.</p>

<p>Operation mode If multiple operation mode options are
given, the last one takes effect.</p>

<p>-z, --compress Compress. This is the default operation
mode when no operation mode option is specified, and no
other operation mode is implied from the command name (for
example, unxz implies --decompress).</p>

<p>-d, --decompress, --uncompress Decompress.</p>

<p>-t, --test Test the integrity of compressed files. No
files are created or removed. This option is equivalent to
--decompress --stdout except that the decompressed data is
discarded instead of being written to standard output.</p>

<p>-l, --list View information about the compressed files.
No uncompressed output is produced, and no files are created
or removed. In list mode, the program cannot read the
compressed data from standard input or from other unseekable
sources.</p>

<p>This feature has not been implemented yet.</p>

<p>Operation modifiers -k, --keep Keep (dont delete) the
input files.</p>

<p>-f, --force This option has several effects:</p>

<p>&middot; If the target file already exists, delete it
before compress- ing or decompressing.</p>

<p>&middot; Compress or decompress even if the input is not
a regular file, has more than one hardlink, or has setuid,
setgid, or sticky bit set. The setuid, setgid, and sticky
bits are not copied to the target file.</p>

<p>&middot; If combined with --decompress --stdout and xz
doesnt recog- nize the type of the source file, xz will copy
the source file as is to standard output. This allows using
xzcat --force like cat(1) for files that have not been
compressed with xz. Note that in future, xz might support
new com- pressed file formats, which may make xz decompress
more types of files instead of copying them as is to
standard output. --format=format can be used to restrict xz
to decompress only a single file format.</p>

<p>&middot; Allow writing compressed data to a terminal,
and reading com- pressed data from a terminal.</p>

<p>-c, --stdout, --to-stdout Write the compressed or
decompressed data to standard output instead of a file. This
implies --keep.</p>

<p>-S .suf, --suffix=.suf When compressing, use .suf as the
suffix for the target file instead of .xz or .lzma. If not
writing to standard output and the source file already has
the suffix .suf, a warning is dis- played and the file is
skipped.</p>

<p>When decompressing, recognize also files with the suffix
.suf in addition to files with the .xz, .txz, .lzma, or .tlz
suffix. If the source file has the suffix .suf, the suffix
is removed to get the target filename.</p>

<p>When compressing or decompressing raw streams
(--format=raw), the suffix must always be specified unless
writing to standard output, because there is no default
suffix for raw streams.</p>

<p>--files[=file] Read the filenames to process from file;
if file is omitted, filenames are read from standard input.
Filenames must be termi- nated with the newline character.
If filenames are given also as command line arguments, they
are processed before the filenames read from file.</p>

<p>--files0[=file] This is identical to --files[=file]
except that the filenames must be terminated with the null
character.</p>

<p>Basic file format and compression options -F format,
--format=format Specify the file format to compress or
decompress:</p>

<p>&middot; auto: This is the default. When compressing,
auto is equiva- lent to xz. When decompressing, the format
of the input file is autodetected. Note that raw streams
(created with --for- mat=raw) cannot be autodetected.</p>

<p>&middot; xz: Compress to the .xz file format, or accept
only .xz files when decompressing.</p>

<p>&middot; lzma or alone: Compress to the legacy .lzma
file format, or accept only .lzma files when decompressing.
The alternative name alone is provided for backwards
compatibility with LZMA Utils.</p>

<p>&middot; raw: Compress or uncompress a raw stream (no
headers). This is meant for advanced users only. To decode
raw streams, you need to set not only --format=raw but also
specify the filter chain, which would normally be stored in
the container format headers.</p>

<p>-C check, --check=check Specify the type of the
integrity check, which is calculated from the uncompressed
data. This option has an effect only when compressing into
the .xz format; the .lzma format doesnt sup- port integrity
checks. The integrity check (if any) is verified when the
.xz file is decompressed.</p>

<p>Supported check types:</p>

<p>&middot; none: Dont calculate an integrity check at all.
This is usu- ally a bad idea. This can be useful when
integrity of the data is verified by other means anyway.</p>

<p>&middot; crc32: Calculate CRC32 using the polynomial
from IEEE-802.3 (Ethernet).</p>

<p>&middot; crc64: Calculate CRC64 using the polynomial
from ECMA-182. This is the default, since it is slightly
better than CRC32 at detecting damaged files and the speed
difference is negli- gible.</p>

<p>&middot; sha256: Calculate SHA-256. This is somewhat
slower than CRC32 and CRC64.</p>

<p>Integrity of the .xz headers is always verified with
CRC32. It is not possible to change or disable it.</p>

<p>-0 ... -9 Select compression preset. If a preset level
is specified multi- ple times, the last one takes
effect.</p>

<p>The compression preset levels can be categorised roughly
into three categories:</p>

<p>-0 ... -2 Fast presets with relatively low memory usage.
-1 and -2 should give compression speed and ratios
comparable to bzip2 -1 and bzip2 -9, respectively. Currently
-0 is not very good (not much faster than -1 but much worse
com- pression). In future, -0 may be indicate some fast
algo- rithm instead of LZMA2.</p>

<p>-3 ... -5 Good compression ratio with low to medium
memory usage. These are significantly slower than levels
0-2.</p>

<p>-6 ... -9 Excellent compression with medium to high
memory usage. These are also slower than the lower preset
levels. The default is -6. Unless you want to maximize the
compres- sion ratio, you probably dont want a higher preset
level than -7 due to speed and memory usage.</p>

<p>The exact compression settings (filter chain) used by
each pre- set may vary between xz versions. The settings may
also vary between files being compressed, if xz determines
that modified settings will probably give better compression
ratio without significantly affecting compression time or
memory usage.</p>

<p>Because the settings may vary, the memory usage may vary
too. The following table lists the maximum memory usage of
each pre- set level, which wont be exceeded even in future
versions of xz.</p>

<p>FIXME: The table below is just a rough idea.</p>

<p>Preset Compression Decompression -0 6 MiB 1 MiB -1 6 MiB
1 MiB -2 10 MiB 1 MiB -3 20 MiB 2 MiB -4 30 MiB 3 MiB -5 60
MiB 6 MiB -6 100 MiB 10 MiB -7 200 MiB 20 MiB -8 400 MiB 40
MiB -9 800 MiB 80 MiB</p>

<p>When compressing, xz automatically adjusts the
compression set- tings downwards if the memory usage limit
would be exceeded, so it is safe to specify a high preset
level even on systems that dont have lots of RAM.</p>

<p>--fast and --best These are somewhat misleading aliases
for -0 and -9, respec- tively. These are provided only for
backwards compatibility with LZMA Utils. Avoid using these
options.</p>

<p>Especially the name of --best is misleading, because the
defini- tion of best depends on the input data, and that
usually people don t want the very best compression ratio
anyway, because it would be very slow.</p>

<p>-e, --extreme Modify the compression preset (-0 ... -9)
so that a little bit better compression ratio can be
achieved without increasing mem- ory usage of the compressor
or decompressor (exception: compres- sor memory usage may
increase a little with presets -0 ... -2). The downside is
that the compression time will increase dramati- cally (it
can easily double).</p>

<p>-M limit, --memory=limit Set the memory usage limit. If
this option is specied multiple times, the last one takes
effect. The limit can be specified in multiple ways:</p>

<p>&middot; The limit can be an absolute value in bytes.
Using an integer suffix like MiB can be useful. Example:
--memory=80MiB</p>

<p>&middot; The limit can be specified as a percentage of
physical RAM. Example: --memory=70%</p>

<p>&middot; The limit can be reset back to its default
value (currently 40 % of physical RAM) by setting it to
0.</p>

<p>&middot; The memory usage limiting can be effectively
disabled by set- ting limit to max. This isnt recommended.
It s usually bet- ter to use, for example, --memory=90%.</p>

<p>The current limit can be seen near the bottom of the
output of the --long-help option.</p>

<p>-T threads, --threads=threads Specify the maximum number
of worker threads to use. The default is the number of
available CPU cores. You can see the current value of
threads near the end of the output of the --long-help
option.</p>

<p>The actual number of worker threads can be less than
threads if using more threads would exceed the memory usage
limit. In addition to CPU-intensive worker threads, xz may
use a few aux- iliary threads, which dont use a lot of CPU
time.</p>

<p>Multithreaded compression and decompression are not
implemented yet, so this option has no effect for now.</p>

<p>Custom compressor filter chains A custom filter chain
allows specifying the compression settings in detail instead
of relying on the settings associated to the preset lev-
els. When a custom filter chain is specified, the
compression preset level options (-0 ... -9 and --extreme)
are silently ignored.</p>

<p>A filter chain is comparable to piping on the UN*X
command line. When compressing, the uncompressed input goes
to the first filter, whose output goes to the next filter
(if any). The output of the last filter gets written to the
compressed file. The maximum number of filters in the chain
is four, but typically a filter chain has only one or two
filters.</p>

<p>Many filters have limitations where they can be in the
filter chain: some filters can work only as the last filter
in the chain, some only as a non-last filter, and some work
in any position in the chain. Depending on the filter, this
limitation is either inherent to the fil- ter design or
exists to prevent security issues.</p>

<p>A custom filter chain is specified by using one or more
filter options in the order they are wanted in the filter
chain. That is, the order of filter options is significant!
When decoding raw streams (--for- mat=raw), the filter chain
is specified in the same order as it was specified when
compressing.</p>

<p>Filters take filter-specific options as a
comma-separated list. Extra commas in options are ignored.
Every option has a default value, so you need to specify
only those you want to change.</p>

<p>--lzma1[=options], --lzma2[=options] Add LZMA1 or LZMA2
filter to the filter chain. These filter can be used only as
the last filter in the chain.</p>

<p>LZMA1 is a legacy filter, which is supported almost
solely due to the legacy .lzma file format, which supports
only LZMA1. LZMA2 is an updated version of LZMA1 to fix some
practical issues of LZMA1. The .xz format uses LZMA2, and
doesnt support LZMA1 at all. Compression speed and ratios of
LZMA1 and LZMA2 are practically the same.</p>

<p>LZMA1 and LZMA2 share the same set of options:</p>

<p>preset=preset Reset all LZMA1 or LZMA2 options to
preset. Preset con- sist of an integer, which may be
followed by single-let- ter preset modifiers. The integer
can be from 0 to 9, matching the command line options -0 ...
-9. The only supported modifier is currently e, which
matches --extreme.</p>

<p>The default preset is 6, from which the default values
for the rest of the LZMA1 or LZMA2 options are taken.</p>

<p>dict=size Dictionary (history buffer) size indicates how
many bytes of the recently processed uncompressed data is
kept in memory. One method to reduce size of the
uncompressed data is to store distance-length pairs, which
indicate what data to repeat from the dictionary buffer. The
big- ger the dictionary, the better the compression ratio
usu- ally is, but dictionaries bigger than the uncompressed
data are waste of RAM.</p>

<p>Typical dictionary size is from 64 KiB to 64 MiB. The
minimum is 4 KiB. The maximum for compression is cur- rently
1.5 GiB. The decompressor already supports dictio- naries up
to one byte less than 4 GiB, which is the maxi- mum for
LZMA1 and LZMA2 stream formats.</p>

<p>Dictionary size has the biggest effect on compression
ratio. Dictionary size and match finder together deter- mine
the memory usage of the LZMA1 or LZMA2 encoder. The same
dictionary size is required for decompressing that was used
when compressing, thus the memory usage of the decoder is
determined by the dictionary size used when compressing.</p>

<p>lc=lc Specify the number of literal context bits. The
minimum is 0 and the maximum is 4; the default is 3. In
addition, the sum of lc and lp must not exceed 4.</p>

<p>lp=lp Specify the number of literal position bits. The
minimum is 0 and the maximum is 4; the default is 0.</p>

<p>pb=pb Specify the number of position bits. The minimum
is 0 and the maximum is 4; the default is 2.</p>

<p>mode=mode Compression mode specifies the function used
to analyze the data produced by the match finder. Supported
modes are fast and normal. The default is fast for presets
0-2 and normal for presets 3-9.</p>

<p>mf=mf Match finder has a major effect on encoder speed,
memory usage, and compression ratio. Usually Hash Chain
match finders are faster than Binary Tree match finders.
Hash Chains are usually used together with mode=fast and
Binary Trees with mode=normal. The memory usage formulas are
only rough estimates, which are closest to reality when dict
is a power of two.</p>

<p>hc3 Hash Chain with 2- and 3-byte hashing Minimum value
for nice: 3 Memory usage: dict * 7.5 (if dict &lt;= 16 MiB);
dict * 5.5 + 64 MiB (if dict &gt; 16 MiB)</p>

<p>hc4 Hash Chain with 2-, 3-, and 4-byte hashing Minimum
value for nice: 4 Memory usage: dict * 7.5</p>

<p>bt2 Binary Tree with 2-byte hashing Minimum value for
nice: 2 Memory usage: dict * 9.5</p>

<p>bt3 Binary Tree with 2- and 3-byte hashing Minimum value
for nice: 3 Memory usage: dict * 11.5 (if dict &lt;= 16
MiB); dict * 9.5 + 64 MiB (if dict &gt; 16 MiB)</p>

<p>bt4 Binary Tree with 2-, 3-, and 4-byte hashing Minimum
value for nice: 4 Memory usage: dict * 11.5</p>

<p>nice=nice Specify what is considered to be a nice length
for a match. Once a match of at least nice bytes is found,
the algorithm stops looking for possibly better matches.</p>

<p>nice can be 2-273 bytes. Higher values tend to give bet-
ter compression ratio at expense of speed. The default
depends on the preset level.</p>

<p>depth=depth Specify the maximum search depth in the
match finder. The default is the special value 0, which
makes the compres- sor determine a reasonable depth from mf
and nice.</p>

<p>Using very high values for depth can make the encoder
extremely slow with carefully crafted files. Avoid set- ting
the depth over 1000 unless you are prepared to interrupt the
compression in case it is taking too long.</p>

<p>When decoding raw streams (--format=raw), LZMA2 needs
only the value of dict. LZMA1 needs also lc, lp, and pb.</p>

<p>--x86[=options]</p>

<p>--powerpc[=options]</p>

<p>--ia64[=options]</p>

<p>--arm[=options]</p>

<p>--armthumb[=options]</p>

<p>--sparc[=options] Add a branch/call/jump (BCJ) filter to
the filter chain. These filters can be used only as non-last
filter in the filter chain.</p>

<p>A BCJ filter converts relative addresses in the machine
code to their absolute counterparts. This doesnt change the
size of the data, but it increases redundancy, which allows
e.g. LZMA2 to get better compression ratio.</p>

<p>The BCJ filters are always reversible, so using a BCJ
filter for wrong type of data doesn t cause any data loss.
However, apply- ing a BCJ filter for wrong type of data is a
bad idea, because it tends to make the compression ratio
worse.</p>

<p>Different instruction sets have have different
alignment:</p>

<p>Filter Alignment Notes x86 1 32-bit and 64-bit x86
PowerPC 4 Big endian only ARM 4 Little endian only ARM-Thumb
2 Little endian only IA-64 16 Big or little endian SPARC 4
Big or little endian</p>

<p>Since the BCJ-filtered data is usually compressed with
LZMA2, the compression ratio may be improved slightly if the
LZMA2 options are set to match the alignment of the selected
BCJ fil- ter. For example, with the IA-64 filter, its good
to set pb=4 with LZMA2 (2^4=16). The x86 filter is an
exception; its usu- ally good to stick to LZMA2s default
four-byte alignment when compressing x86 executables.</p>

<p>All BCJ filters support the same options:</p>

<p>start=offset Specify the start offset that is used when
converting between relative and absolute addresses. The
offset must be a multiple of the alignment of the filter
(see the ta- ble above). The default is zero. In practice,
the default is good; specifying a custom offset is almost
never useful.</p>

<p>Specifying a non-zero start offset is probably useful
only if the executable has multiple sections, and there are
many cross-section jumps or calls. Applying a BCJ filter
separately for each section with proper start off- set and
then compressing the result as a single chunk may give some
improvement in compression ratio compared to applying the
BCJ filter with the default offset for the whole
executable.</p>

<p>--delta[=options] Add Delta filter to the filter chain.
The Delta filter can be used only as non-last filter in the
filter chain.</p>

<p>Currently only simple byte-wise delta calculation is
supported. It can be useful when compressing e.g.
uncompressed bitmap images or uncompressed PCM audio.
However, special purpose algo- rithms may give significantly
better results than Delta + LZMA2. This is true especially
with audio, which compresses faster and better e.g. with
FLAC.</p>

<p>Supported options:</p>

<p>dist=distance Specify the distance of the delta
calculation as bytes. distance must be 1-256. The default is
1.</p>

<p>For example, with dist=2 and eight-byte input A1 B1 A2
B3 A3 B5 A4 B7, the output will be A1 B1 01 02 01 02 01
02.</p>

<p>Other options -q, --quiet Suppress warnings and notices.
Specify this twice to suppress errors too. This option has
no effect on the exit status. That is, even if a warning was
suppressed, the exit status to indi- cate a warning is still
used.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be verbose. If standard error is connected
to a terminal, xz will display a progress indicator.
Specifying --verbose twice will give even more verbose
output (useful mostly for debugging).</p>

<p>-Q, --no-warn Don t set the exit status to 2 even if a
condition worth a warn- ing was detected. This option doesn
t affect the verbosity level, thus both --quiet and
--no-warn have to be used to not display warnings and to not
alter the exit status.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a help message describing the most
commonly used options, and exit successfully.</p>

<p>-H, --long-help Display a help message describing all
features of xz, and exit successfully</p>

<p>-V, --version Display the version number of xz and
liblzma.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 All is good.</p>

<p>1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>2 Something worth a warning occurred, but no actual
errors occurred.</p>

<p>Notices (not warnings or errors) printed on standard
error dont affect the exit status.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT XZ_OPT A space-separated list of options is
parsed from XZ_OPT before parsing the options given on the
command line. Note that only options are parsed from XZ_OPT;
all non-options are silently ignored. Parsing is done with
getopt_long(3) which is used also for the command line
arguments.</p>

<p>LZMA UTILS COMPATIBILITY The command line syntax of xz
is practically a superset of lzma, unlzma, and lzcat as
found from LZMA Utils 4.32.x. In most cases, it is possible
to replace LZMA Utils with XZ Utils without breaking
existing scripts. There are some incompatibilities though,
which may sometimes cause problems.</p>

<p>Compression preset levels The numbering of the
compression level presets is not identical in xz and LZMA
Utils. The most important difference is how dictionary sizes
are mapped to different presets. Dictionary size is roughly
equal to the decompressor memory usage.</p>

<p>Level xz LZMA Utils -1 64 KiB 64 KiB -2 512 KiB 1 MiB -3
1 MiB 512 KiB -4 2 MiB 1 MiB -5 4 MiB 2 MiB -6 8 MiB 4 MiB
-7 16 MiB 8 MiB -8 32 MiB 16 MiB -9 64 MiB 32 MiB</p>

<p>The dictionary size differences affect the compressor
memory usage too, but there are some other differences
between LZMA Utils and XZ Utils, which make the difference
even bigger:</p>

<p>Level xz LZMA Utils 4.32.x -1 2 MiB 2 MiB -2 5 MiB 12
MiB -3 13 MiB 12 MiB -4 25 MiB 16 MiB -5 48 MiB 26 MiB -6 94
MiB 45 MiB -7 186 MiB 83 MiB -8 370 MiB 159 MiB -9 674 MiB
311 MiB</p>

<p>The default preset level in LZMA Utils is -7 while in XZ
Utils it is -6, so both use 8 MiB dictionary by default.</p>

<p>Streamed vs. non-streamed .lzma files Uncompressed size
of the file can be stored in the .lzma header. LZMA Utils
does that when compressing regular files. The alternative is
to mark that uncompressed size is unknown and use end of
payload marker to indicate where the decompressor should
stop. LZMA Utils uses this method when uncompressed size
isnt known, which is the case for exam- ple in pipes.</p>

<p>xz supports decompressing .lzma files with or without
end of payload marker, but all .lzma files created by xz
will use end of payload marker and have uncompressed size
marked as unknown in the .lzma header. This may be a problem
in some (uncommon) situations. For exam- ple, a .lzma
decompressor in an embedded device might work only with
files that have known uncompressed size. If you hit this
problem, you need to use LZMA Utils or LZMA SDK to create
.lzma files with known uncompressed size.</p>

<p>Unsupported .lzma files The .lzma format allows lc
values up to 8, and lp values up to 4. LZMA Utils can
decompress files with any lc and lp, but always creates
files with lc=3 and lp=0. Creating files with other lc and
lp is possible with xz and with LZMA SDK.</p>

<p>The implementation of the LZMA1 filter in liblzma
requires that the sum of lc and lp must not exceed 4. Thus,
.lzma files which exceed this limitation, cannot be
decompressed with xz.</p>

<p>LZMA Utils creates only .lzma files which have
dictionary size of 2^n (a power of 2), but accepts files
with any dictionary size. liblzma accepts only .lzma files
which have dictionary size of 2^n or 2^n + 2^(n-1). This is
to decrease false positives when autodetecting .lzma
files.</p>

<p>These limitations shouldnt be a problem in practice,
since practically all .lzma files have been compressed with
settings that liblzma will accept.</p>

<p>Trailing garbage When decompressing, LZMA Utils silently
ignore everything after the first .lzma stream. In most
situations, this is a bug. This also means that LZMA Utils
dont support decompressing concatenated .lzma files.</p>

<p>If there is data left after the first .lzma stream, xz
considers the file to be corrupt. This may break obscure
scripts which have assumed that trailing garbage is
ignored.</p>

<p>NOTES Compressed output may vary The exact compressed
output produced from the same uncompressed input file may
vary between XZ Utils versions even if compression options
are identical. This is because the encoder can be improved
(faster or bet- ter compression) without affecting the file
format. The output can vary even between different builds of
the same XZ Utils version, if differ- ent build options are
used or if the endianness of the hardware is dif- ferent for
different builds.</p>

<p>The above means that implementing --rsyncable to create
rsyncable .xz files is not going to happen without freezing
a part of the encoder implementation, which can then be used
with --rsyncable.</p>

<p>Embedded .xz decompressors Embedded .xz decompressor
implementations like XZ Embedded dont neces- sarily support
files created with check types other than none and crc32.
Since the default is --check=crc64, you must use
--check=none or --check=crc32 when creating files for
embedded systems.</p>

<p>Outside embedded systems, all .xz format decompressors
support all the check types, or at least are able to
decompress the file without veri- fying the integrity check
if the particular check is not supported.</p>

<p>XZ Embedded supports BCJ filters, but only with the
default start off- set.</p>
