<p>NAME makewhatis - Create the whatis database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS makewhatis [-u] [-v] [-w] [-s sections ] [-c
[catpath]] [manpath]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION makewhatis reads all the manual pages
contained in the given sections of manpath or the
preformatted pages contained in the given sections of
catpath. For each page, it writes a line in the whatis
database; each line consists of the name of the page and a
short description, sepa- rated by a dash. The description is
extracted using the content of the NAME section of the
manual page.</p>

<p>Since other languages use a different term for the NAME
section, make- whatis recognizes the equivalent terms in
Czech, Italian, Finnish, French, German and Spanish.</p>

<p>If no manpath argument is given, /usr/man is assumed by
default.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -u Update database with new pages (files status
was last changed 24 hours ago)</p>

<p>-v Verbose output</p>

<p>-w Use manpath obtained from man --path</p>

<p>-s sections Looks in the sections of manpath or catpath.
If the option is absent, the MANSECT env var will be used.
If it too is absent, the MANSECT setting in man.conf will be
used.</p>

<p>-c catpath The preformatted manual pages located in
catpath are scanned. If the argument is not provided, it is
assumed to be the first existing directory between
/usr/man/preformat and /usr/man.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To rebuild only /usr/X11R6/man/whatis and
/usr/local/man/whatis</p>

<p>makewhatis /usr/X11R6/man /usr/local/man</p>

<p>To rebuild all the databases, including those of the
Finnish, French and Italian translations</p>

<p>LANGUAGE=fi:fr:it makewhatis -w</p>

<p>BUGS makewhatis may not handle too well manual pages
written with non-stan- dard troff macros, such as the Tcl/Tk
pages.</p>

<p>makewhatis does not work on preformatted
translations.</p>

<p>AUTHOR John W. Eaton was the original author of man.
Zeyd M. Ben-Halim released man 1.2, and Andries Brouwer
followed up with versions 1.3 thru 1.5p. Federico Lucifredi
&lt;flucifredi@acm.org&gt; is the current maintainer.</p>
