<p>STRCOLL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRCOLL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strcoll - string comparison using collating
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>int strcoll(const char *s1, const char *s2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strcoll() function shall compare the
string pointed to by s1 to the string pointed to by s2, both
interpreted as appropriate to the LC_COL- LATE category of
the current locale.</p>

<p>The strcoll() function shall not change the setting of
errno if suc- cessful.</p>

<p>Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error,
an application wishing to check for error situations should
set errno to 0, then call strcoll(), then check errno.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, strcoll() shall
return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether the string pointed to by s1 is greater
than, equal to, or less than the string pointed to by s2
when both are interpreted as appropriate to the current
locale. On error, strcoll() may set errno, but no return
value is reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The strcoll() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The s1 or s2 arguments contain characters outside
the domain of the collating sequence.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Comparing Nodes The following example uses an
application-defined function, node_com- pare(), to compare
two nodes based on an alphabetical ordering of the string
field.</p>

<p>#include &lt;string.h&gt; ... struct node { /* These are
stored in the table. */ char *string; int length; }; ... int
node_compare(const void *node1, const void *node2) { return
strcoll(((const struct node *)node1)-&gt;string, ((const
struct node *)node2)-&gt;string); } ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The strxfrm() and strcmp() functions
should be used for sorting large lists.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
