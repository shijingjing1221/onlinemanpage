<p>NAME pmdasimple - simple performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/pmdasimple [-d domain]
[-i port] [-l logfile] [-p] [-u socket] [-U username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdasimple is a simple Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports a small number of
synthetic performance metrics.</p>

<p>The simple PMDA is shipped as source code and is
designed to be an aid for PMDA developers. In terms of code
size and features, it is more complex than the trivial PMDA,
about the same as the txmon PMDA and less complex than the
sample PMDA. The source for the simple PMDA is a good
template from which production, customized PMDAs can be
developed.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdasimple command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-i Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the specified
TCP/IP port. port may be a port number or port name.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named simple.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdasimple is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-p Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
pmdasimple is via standard input and standard output. This
is the default con- nection mode.</p>

<p>-u Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the Unix
domain socket named socket.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>At most one of the options -i, -p and -u may be
specified.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access the names, help text and
values for the simple per- formance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdasimple is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdasimple $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/help default help
text file for the simple metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/Install installation script for the
pmdasimple agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdasimple agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/simple.conf configuration file for the
dynamic instance domain that underlies the simple.now
performance metric. For a descrip- tion, refer to the help
text file, or run the command $ pminfo -T simple.now
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/*.pmda_simple.so The DSO version of
the PMDA. The same source is used to cre- ate both the DSO
and the daemon versions of the simple PMDA, and one or the
other may be installed as part of the dialog in the Install
script. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/simple.log default log file for
error messages and other information from pmdasimple</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
