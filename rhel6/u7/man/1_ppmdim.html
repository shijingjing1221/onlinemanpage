<p>NAME ppmdim - dim a PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmdim dimfactor [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>This program is largely obsoleted by the more general
pam- func(1)(usethe-multiplier option). ppmdim remains for
backward compat- ibility and also because its use of integer
arithmetic may make it faster.</p>

<p>ppmdim reads a PPM image input. Diminishes its
brightness by the speci- fied dimfactor. The dimfactor may
be in the range from 0.0 (total blackness, deep night, nada,
null, nothing) to 1.0 (original pictures brightness).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ppm(1), pamfunc(1),</p>
