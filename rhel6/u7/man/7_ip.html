<p>IP(7) Linux Programmer s Manual IP(7)</p>

<p>NAME ip - Linux IPv4 protocol implementation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt; #include &lt;netinet/ip.h&gt; /*
superset of previous */</p>

<p>tcp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); udp_socket
= socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0); raw_socket =
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, protocol);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux implements the Internet Protocol,
version 4, described in RFC 791 and RFC 1122. ip contains a
level 2 multicasting implementation con- forming to RFC
1112. It also contains an IP router including a packet
filter.</p>

<p>The programming interface is BSD-sockets compatible. For
more informa- tion on sockets, see socket(7).</p>

<p>An IP socket is created by calling the socket(2)
function as socket(AF_INET, socket_type, protocol). Valid
socket types are SOCK_STREAM to open a tcp(7) socket,
SOCK_DGRAM to open a udp(7) socket, or SOCK_RAW to open a
raw(7) socket to access the IP protocol directly. protocol
is the IP protocol in the IP header to be received or sent.
The only valid values for protocol are 0 and IPPROTO_TCP for
TCP sockets, and 0 and IPPROTO_UDP for UDP sockets. For
SOCK_RAW you may specify a valid IANA IP protocol defined in
RFC 1700 assigned num- bers.</p>

<p>When a process wants to receive new incoming packets or
connections, it should bind a socket to a local interface
address using bind(2). In this case, only one IP socket may
be bound to any given local (address, port) pair. When
INADDR_ANY is specified in the bind call, the socket will be
bound to all local interfaces. When listen(2) is called on
an unbound socket, the socket is automatically bound to a
random free port with the local address set to INADDR_ANY.
When connect(2) is called on an unbound socket, the socket
is automatically bound to a random free port or an usable
shared port with the local address set to INADDR_ANY.</p>

<p>A TCP local socket address that has been bound is
unavailable for some time after closing, unless the
SO_REUSEADDR flag has been set. Care should be taken when
using this flag as it makes TCP less reliable.</p>

<p>Address Format An IP socket address is defined as a
combination of an IP interface address and a 16-bit port
number. The basic IP protocol does not sup- ply port
numbers, they are implemented by higher level protocols like
udp(7) and tcp(7). On raw sockets sin_port is set to the IP
protocol.</p>

<p>struct sockaddr_in { sa_family_t sin_family; /* address
family: AF_INET */ in_port_t sin_port; /* port in network
byte order */ struct in_addr sin_addr; /* internet address
*/ };</p>

<p>/* Internet address. */ struct in_addr { uint32_t
s_addr; /* address in network byte order */ };</p>

<p>sin_family is always set to AF_INET. This is required;
in Linux 2.2 most networking functions return EINVAL when
this setting is missing. sin_port contains the port in
network byte order. The port numbers below 1024 are called
privileged ports (or sometimes: reserved ports). Only
privileged processes (i.e., those having the
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability) may bind(2) to these
sockets. Note that the raw IPv4 pro- tocol as such has no
concept of a port, they are only implemented by higher
protocols like tcp(7) and udp(7).</p>

<p>sin_addr is the IP host address. The s_addr member of
struct in_addr contains the host interface address in
network byte order. in_addr should be assigned one of the
INADDR_* values (e.g., INADDR_ANY) or set using the
inet_aton(3), inet_addr(3), inet_makeaddr(3) library func-
tions or directly with the name resolver (see
gethostbyname(3)).</p>

<p>IPv4 addresses are divided into unicast, broadcast and
multicast addresses. Unicast addresses specify a single
interface of a host, broadcast addresses specify all hosts
on a network and multicast addresses address all hosts in a
multicast group. Datagrams to broad- cast addresses can be
only sent or received when the SO_BROADCAST socket flag is
set. In the current implementation, connection-oriented
sockets are only allowed to use unicast addresses.</p>

<p>Note that the address and the port are always stored in
network byte order. In particular, this means that you need
to call htons(3) on the number that is assigned to a port.
All address/port manipulation func- tions in the standard
library work in network byte order.</p>

<p>There are several special addresses: INADDR_LOOPBACK
(127.0.0.1) always refers to the local host via the loopback
device; INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0) means any address for binding;
INADDR_BROADCAST (255.255.255.255) means any host and has
the same effect on bind as INADDR_ANY for historical
reasons.</p>

<p>Socket Options IP supports some protocol-specific socket
options that can be set with setsockopt(2) and read with
getsockopt(2). The socket option level for IP is IPPROTO_IP.
A boolean integer flag is zero when it is false, otherwise
true.</p>

<p>IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 1.2) Join a multicast
group. Argument is an ip_mreqn structure.</p>

<p>struct ip_mreqn { struct in_addr imr_multiaddr; /* IP
multicast group address */ struct in_addr imr_address; /* IP
address of local interface */ int imr_ifindex; /* interface
index */ };</p>

<p>imr_multiaddr contains the address of the multicast
group the application wants to join or leave. It must be a
valid multi- cast address (or setsockopt(2) fails with the
error EINVAL). imr_address is the address of the local
interface with which the system should join the multicast
group; if it is equal to INADDR_ANY an appropriate interface
is chosen by the system. imr_ifindex is the interface index
of the interface that should join/leave the imr_multiaddr
group, or 0 to indicate any inter- face.</p>

<p>The ip_mreqn is available only since Linux 2.2. For
compatibil- ity, the old ip_mreq structure (present since
Linux 1.2) is still supported. It differs from ip_mreqn only
by not including the imr_ifindex field. Only valid as a
setsockopt(2).</p>

<p>IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 2.5.68) Join a
multicast group and allow receiving data only from a
specified source. Argument is an ip_mreq_source
structure.</p>

<p>struct ip_mreq_source { struct in_addr imr_multiaddr; /*
IP multicast group address */ struct in_addr imr_interface;
/* IP address of local interface */ struct in_addr
imr_sourceaddr; /* IP address of multicast source */ };</p>

<p>ip_mreq_source structure is similar to ip_mreqn
described at IP_ADD_MEMBERSIP. imr_multiaddr contains the
address of the multicast group the application wants to join
or leave. imr_interface is the address of the local
interface with which the system should join the multicast
group. Finally imr_sourceaddr field contains address of the
source the applica- tion wants to receive data from.</p>

<p>This option can be used multiple times to allow
receiving data from more than one source.</p>

<p>IP_BLOCK_SOURCE (since Linux 2.5.68) Stop receiving
multicast data from a specific source in a given group. This
is valid only after the application has subscribed to the
multicast group using either IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP or
IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p>Argument is an ip_mreq_source structure as described at
IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p>IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 1.2) Leave a multicast
group. Argument is an ip_mreqn or ip_mreq structure similar
to IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p>IP_DROP_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP (since Linux 2.5.68) Leave a
source-specific group, i.e., stop receiving data from a
given multicast group that come from a given source). If the
application has subscribed to multiple sources within the
same group, data from the remaining sources will still be
delivered. To stop receiving data from all sources at once
use IP_LEAVE_GROUP.</p>

<p>Argument is an ip_mreq_source structure as described at
IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p>IP_FREEBIND (since Linux 2.4) If enabled, this boolean
option allows binding to an IP address that is nonlocal or
does not (yet) exist. This permits listen- ing on a socket,
without requiring the underlying network inter- face or the
specified dynamic IP address to be up at the time that the
application is trying to bind to it. This option is the
per-socket equivalent of the ip_nonlocal_bind /proc inter-
face described below.</p>

<p>IP_HDRINCL (since Linux 2.0) If enabled, the user
supplies an IP header in front of the user data. Only valid
for SOCK_RAW sockets. See raw(7) for more information. When
this flag is enabled the values set by IP_OPTIONS, IP_TTL
and IP_TOS are ignored.</p>

<p>IP_MSFILTER (since Linux 2.5.68) This option provides
access to the advanced full-state filtering API. Argument is
an ip_msfilter structure.</p>

<p>struct ip_msfilter { struct in_addr imsf_multiaddr; /*
IP multicast group address */ struct in_addr imsf_interface;
/* IP address of local interface */ uint32_t imsf_fmode; /*
Filter-mode */</p>

<p>uint32_t imsf_numsrc; /* Number of sources in the
following array */ struct in_addr imsf_slist[1]; /* Array of
source addresses */ };</p>

<p>There are two macros, MCAST_INCLUDE and MCAST_EXCLUDE,
which can be used to specify the filtering mode.
Additionaly, IP_MSFIL- TER_SIZE(n) macro exists to determine
how much memory is needed to store ip_msfilter structure
with n sources in the source list.</p>

<p>For the full description of multicast source filtering
refer to RFC 3376.</p>

<p>IP_MTU (since Linux 2.2) Retrieve the current known path
MTU of the current socket. Only valid when the socket has
been connected. Returns an integer. Only valid as a
getsockopt(2).</p>

<p>IP_MTU_DISCOVER (since Linux 2.2) Sets or receives the
Path MTU Discovery setting for a socket. When enabled, Linux
will perform Path MTU Discovery as defined in RFC 1191 on
this socket. The dont-fragment flag is set on all outgoing
datagrams. The system-wide default is controlled by the
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc file for SOCK_STREAM
sockets, and disabled on all others. For non-SOCK_STREAM
sock- ets, it is the users responsibility to packetize the
data in MTU sized chunks and to do the retransmits if
necessary. The kernel will reject packets that are bigger
than the known path MTU if this flag is set (with
EMSGSIZE).</p>

<p>Path MTU discovery flags Meaning IP_PMTUDISC_WANT Use
per-route settings. IP_PMTUDISC_DONT Never do Path MTU
Discovery. IP_PMTUDISC_DO Always do Path MTU Discovery.
IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE Set DF but ignore Path MTU.</p>

<p>When PMTU discovery is enabled, the kernel automatically
keeps track of the path MTU per destination host. When it is
con- nected to a specific peer with connect(2), the
currently known path MTU can be retrieved conveniently using
the IP_MTU socket option (e.g., after a EMSGSIZE error
occurred). It may change over time. For connectionless
sockets with many destinations, the new MTU for a given
destination can also be accessed using the error queue (see
IP_RECVERR). A new error will be queued for every incoming
MTU update.</p>

<p>While MTU discovery is in progress, initial packets from
data- gram sockets may be dropped. Applications using UDP
should be aware of this and not take it into account for
their packet retransmit strategy.</p>

<p>To bootstrap the path MTU discovery process on
unconnected sock- ets, it is possible to start with a big
datagram size (up to 64K-headers bytes long) and let it
shrink by updates of the path MTU.</p>

<p>To get an initial estimate of the path MTU, connect a
datagram socket to the destination address using connect(2)
and retrieve the MTU by calling getsockopt(2) with the
IP_MTU option.</p>

<p>It is possible to implement RFC 4821 MTU probing with
SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_RAW sockets by setting a value of
IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE (available since Linux 2.6.22). This is
also particularly use- ful for diagnostic tools such as
tracepath(8) that wish to deliberately send probe packets
larger than the observed Path MTU.</p>

<p>IP_MULTICAST_ALL (since Linux 2.6.31) Sets the policy
for multicast delivery to the socket. Argument is a boolean
integer that enables or disables multicast delivery from all
groups. If not set, delivery to the socket is restricted to
data from those multicast groups that have been explicitly
subscribed to via a multicast join operation for this
socket. The default is 1 which means that a socket which is
bound to the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY) will receive
multi- cast packets from all groups that have been
subscribed to on this system.</p>

<p>IP_MULTICAST_IF (since Linux 1.2) Set the local device
for a multicast socket. Argument is an ip_mreqn or ip_mreq
structure similar to IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p>When an invalid socket option is passed, ENOPROTOOPT is
returned.</p>

<p>IP_MULTICAST_LOOP (since Linux 1.2) Sets or reads a
boolean integer argument that determines whether sent
multicast packets should be looped back to the local sock-
ets.</p>

<p>IP_MULTICAST_TTL (since Linux 1.2) Set or read the
time-to-live value of outgoing multicast packets for this
socket. It is very important for multicast packets to set
the smallest TTL possible. The default is 1 which means that
multicast packets don t leave the local network unless the
user program explicitly requests it. Argument is an
integer.</p>

<p>IP_OPTIONS (since Linux 2.0) Sets or get the IP options
to be sent with every packet from this socket. The arguments
are a pointer to a memory buffer containing the options and
the option length. The setsockopt(2) call sets the IP
options associated with a socket. The maximum option size
for IPv4 is 40 bytes. See RFC 791 for the allowed options.
When the initial connection request packet for a SOCK_STREAM
socket contains IP options, the IP options will be set
automatically to the options from the initial packet with
routing headers reversed. Incoming packets are not allowed
to change options after the connection is established. The
pro- cessing of all incoming source routing options is
disabled by default and can be enabled by using the
accept_source_route /proc interface. Other options like
timestamps are still han- dled. For datagram sockets, IP
options can be only set by the local user. Calling
getsockopt(2) with IP_OPTIONS puts the cur- rent IP options
used for sending into the supplied buffer.</p>

<p>IP_PKTINFO (since Linux 2.2) Pass an IP_PKTINFO
ancillary message that contains a pktinfo structure that
supplies some information about the incoming packet. This
only works for datagram oriented sockets. The argument is a
flag that tells the socket whether the IP_PKTINFO message
should be passed or not. The message itself can only be
sent/retrieved as control message with a packet using
recvmsg(2) or sendmsg(2).</p>

<p>struct in_pktinfo { unsigned int ipi_ifindex; /*
Interface index */ struct in_addr ipi_spec_dst; /* Local
address */ struct in_addr ipi_addr; /* Header Destination
address */ };</p>

<p>ipi_ifindex is the unique index of the interface the
packet was received on. ipi_spec_dst is the local address of
the packet and ipi_addr is the destination address in the
packet header. If IP_PKTINFO is passed to sendmsg(2) and
ipi_spec_dst is not zero, then it is used as the local
source address for the rout- ing table lookup and for
setting up IP source route options. When ipi_ifindex is not
zero, the primary local address of the interface specified
by the index overwrites ipi_spec_dst for the routing table
lookup.</p>

<p>IP_RECVERR (since Linux 2.2) Enable extended reliable
error message passing. When enabled on a datagram socket,
all generated errors will be queued in a per- socket error
queue. When the user receives an error from a socket
operation, the errors can be received by calling recvmsg(2)
with the MSG_ERRQUEUE flag set. The sock_extended_err
structure describing the error will be passed in an
ancillary message with the type IP_RECVERR and the level
IPPROTO_IP. This is useful for reliable error handling on
unconnected sockets. The received data portion of the error
queue contains the error packet.</p>

<p>The IP_RECVERR control message contains a
sock_extended_err structure:</p>

<p>#define SO_EE_ORIGIN_NONE 0 #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL 1
#define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP 2 #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6 3</p>

<p>struct sock_extended_err { uint32_t ee_errno; /* error
number */ uint8_t ee_origin; /* where the error originated
*/ uint8_t ee_type; /* type */ uint8_t ee_code; /* code */
uint8_t ee_pad; uint32_t ee_info; /* additional information
*/ uint32_t ee_data; /* other data */ /* More data may
follow */ };</p>

<p>struct sockaddr *SO_EE_OFFENDER(struct sock_extended_err
*);</p>

<p>ee_errno contains the errno number of the queued error.
ee_ori- gin is the origin code of where the error
originated. The other fields are protocol-specific. The
macro SO_EE_OFFENDER returns a pointer to the address of the
network object where the error originated from given a
pointer to the ancillary message. If this address is not
known, the sa_family member of the sockaddr contains
AF_UNSPEC and the other fields of the sockaddr are
undefined.</p>

<p>IP uses the sock_extended_err structure as follows:
ee_origin is set to SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP for errors received as
an ICMP packet, or SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL for locally generated
errors. Unknown values should be ignored. ee_type and
ee_code are set from the type and code fields of the ICMP
header. ee_info contains the discovered MTU for EMSGSIZE
errors. The message also contains the sockaddr_in of the
node caused the error, which can be accessed with the
SO_EE_OFFENDER macro. The sin_family field of the
SO_EE_OFFENDER address is AF_UNSPEC when the source was
unknown. When the error originated from the network, all IP
options (IP_OPTIONS, IP_TTL, etc.) enabled on the socket and
contained in the error packet are passed as control
messages. The payload of the packet causing the error is
returned as nor- mal payload. Note that TCP has no error
queue; MSG_ERRQUEUE is not permitted on SOCK_STREAM sockets.
IP_RECVERR is valid for TCP, but all errors are returned by
socket function return or SO_ERROR only.</p>

<p>For raw sockets, IP_RECVERR enables passing of all
received ICMP errors to the application, otherwise errors
are only reported on connected sockets</p>

<p>It sets or retrieves an integer boolean flag. IP_RECVERR
defaults to off.</p>

<p>IP_RECVOPTS (since Linux 2.2) Pass all incoming IP
options to the user in a IP_OPTIONS control message. The
routing header and other options are already filled in for
the local host. Not supported for SOCK_STREAM sockets.</p>

<p>IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR (since Linux 2.6.29) This boolean
option enables the IP_ORIGDSTADDR ancillary message in
recvmsg(2), in which the kernel returns the original
destina- tion address of the datagram being received. The
ancillary mes- sage contains a struct sockaddr_in.</p>

<p>IP_RECVTOS (since Linux 2.2) If enabled the IP_TOS
ancillary message is passed with incoming packets. It
contains a byte which specifies the Type of Ser-
vice/Precedence field of the packet header. Expects a
boolean integer flag.</p>

<p>IP_RECVTTL (since Linux 2.2) When this flag is set, pass
a IP_TTL control message with the time to live field of the
received packet as a byte. Not sup- ported for SOCK_STREAM
sockets.</p>

<p>IP_RETOPTS (since Linux 2.2) Identical to IP_RECVOPTS,
but returns raw unprocessed options with timestamp and route
record options not filled in for this hop.</p>

<p>IP_ROUTER_ALERT (since Linux 2.2) Pass all to-be
forwarded packets with the IP Router Alert option set to
this socket. Only valid for raw sockets. This is use- ful,
for instance, for user-space RSVP daemons. The tapped
packets are not forwarded by the kernel; it is the users
responsibility to send them out again. Socket binding is
ignored, such packets are only filtered by protocol. Expects
an integer flag.</p>

<p>IP_TOS (since Linux 1.0) Set or receive the
Type-Of-Service (TOS) field that is sent with every IP
packet originating from this socket. It is used to
prioritize packets on the network. TOS is a byte. There are
some standard TOS flags defined: IPTOS_LOWDELAY to minimize
delays for interactive traffic, IPTOS_THROUGHPUT to optimize
throughput, IPTOS_RELIABILITY to optimize for reliability,
IPTOS_MINCOST should be used for &quot;filler data&quot;
where slow trans- mission doesn t matter. At most one of
these TOS values can be specified. Other bits are invalid
and shall be cleared. Linux sends IPTOS_LOWDELAY datagrams
first by default, but the exact behavior depends on the
configured queueing discipline. Some high priority levels
may require superuser privileges (the CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability). The priority can also be set in a protocol
independent way by the (SOL_SOCKET, SO_PRIORITY) socket
option (see socket(7)).</p>

<p>IP_TRANSPARENT (since Linux 2.6.24) Setting this boolean
option enables transparent proxying on this socket. This
socket option allows the calling application to bind to a
nonlocal IP address and operate both as a client and a
server with the foreign address as the local endpoint. NOTE:
this requires that routing be set up in a way that packets
going to the foreign address are routed through the TProxy
box. Enabling this socket option requires superuser
privileges (the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability).</p>

<p>TProxy redirection with the iptables TPROXY target also
requires that this option be set on the redirected
socket.</p>

<p>IP_TTL (since Linux 1.0) Set or retrieve the current
time-to-live field that is used in every packet sent from
this socket.</p>

<p>IP_UNBLOCK_SOURCE (since Linux 2.5.68) Unblock
previously blocked multicast source. Returns EADDRNO- TAVAIL
when given source is not being blocked.</p>

<p>Argument is an ip_mreq_source structure as described at
IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p>/proc interfaces The IP protocol supports a set of /proc
interfaces to configure some global parameters. The
parameters can be accessed by reading or writ- ing files in
the directory /proc/sys/net/ipv4/. Interfaces described as
Boolean take an integer value, with a non-zero value
(&quot;true&quot;) mean- ing that the corresponding option
is enabled, and a zero value (&quot;false&quot;) meaning
that the option is disabled.</p>

<p>ip_always_defrag (Boolean; since Linux 2.2.13) [New with
kernel 2.2.13; in earlier kernel versions this feature was
controlled at compile time by the CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG
option; this option is not present in 2.4.x and later]</p>

<p>When this boolean frag is enabled (not equal 0),
incoming frag- ments (parts of IP packets that arose when
some host between origin and destination decided that the
packets were too large and cut them into pieces) will be
reassembled (defragmented) before being processed, even if
they are about to be forwarded.</p>

<p>Only enable if running either a firewall that is the
sole link to your network or a transparent proxy; never ever
use it for a normal router or host. Otherwise fragmented
communication can be disturbed if the fragments travel over
different links. Defragmentation also has a large memory and
CPU time cost.</p>

<p>This is automagically turned on when masquerading or
transparent proxying are configured.</p>

<p>ip_autoconfig (since Linux 2.2 to 2.6.17) Not
documented.</p>

<p>ip_default_ttl (integer; default: 64; since Linux 2.2)
Set the default time-to-live value of outgoing packets. This
can be changed per socket with the IP_TTL option.</p>

<p>ip_dynaddr (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux
2.0.31) Enable dynamic socket address and masquerading entry
rewriting on interface address change. This is useful for
dialup inter- face with changing IP addresses. 0 means no
rewriting, 1 turns it on and 2 enables verbose mode.</p>

<p>ip_forward (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux 1.2)
Enable IP forwarding with a boolean flag. IP forwarding can
be also set on a per-interface basis.</p>

<p>ip_local_port_range (since Linux 2.2) Contains two
integers that define the default local port range allocated
to sockets. Allocation starts with the first number and ends
with the second number. Note that these should not conflict
with the ports used by masquerading (although the case is
handled). Also arbitrary choices may cause problems with
some firewall packet filters that make assumptions about the
local ports in use. First number should be at least greater
than 1024, or better, greater than 4096, to avoid clashes
with well known ports and to minimize firewall problems.</p>

<p>ip_no_pmtu_disc (Boolean; default: disabled; since Linux
2.2) If enabled, dont do Path MTU Discovery for TCP sockets
by default. Path MTU discovery may fail if misconfigured
firewalls (that drop all ICMP packets) or misconfigured
interfaces (e.g., a point-to-point link where the both ends
dont agree on the MTU) are on the path. It is better to fix
the broken routers on the path than to turn off Path MTU
Discovery globally, because not doing it incurs a high cost
to the network.</p>

<p>ip_nonlocal_bind (Boolean; default: disabled; since
Linux 2.4) If set, allows processes to bind(2) to non-local
IP addresses, which can be quite useful, but may break some
applications.</p>

<p>ip6frag_time (integer; default 30) Time in seconds to
keep an IPv6 fragment in memory.</p>

<p>ip6frag_secret_interval (integer; default 600)
Regeneration interval (in seconds) of the hash secret (or
life- time for the hash secret) for IPv6 fragments.</p>

<p>ipfrag_high_thresh (integer), ipfrag_low_thresh
(integer) If the amount of queued IP fragments reaches
ipfrag_high_thresh, the queue is pruned down to
ipfrag_low_thresh. Contains an integer with the number of
bytes.</p>

<p>neigh/* See arp(7).</p>

<p>Ioctls All ioctls described in socket(7) apply to
ip.</p>

<p>Ioctls to configure generic device parameters are
described in netde- vice(7).</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES The user tried to execute an operation
without the necessary permissions. These include: sending a
packet to a broadcast address without having the
SO_BROADCAST flag set; sending a packet via a prohibit
route; modifying firewall settings without superuser
privileges (the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability); binding to a
privileged port without superuser privileges (the
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability).</p>

<p>EADDRINUSE Tried to bind to an address already in
use.</p>

<p>EADDRNOTAVAIL A nonexistent interface was requested or
the requested source address was not local.</p>

<p>EAGAIN Operation on a non-blocking socket would
block.</p>

<p>EALREADY An connection operation on a non-blocking
socket is already in progress.</p>

<p>ECONNABORTED A connection was closed during an
accept(2).</p>

<p>EHOSTUNREACH No valid routing table entry matches the
destination address. This error can be caused by a ICMP
message from a remote router or for the local routing
table.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid argument passed. For send operations this
can be caused by sending to a blackhole route.</p>

<p>EISCONN connect(2) was called on an already connected
socket.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE Datagram is bigger than an MTU on the path and
it cannot be fragmented.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS, ENOMEM Not enough free memory. This often means
that the memory allo- cation is limited by the socket buffer
limits, not by the system memory, but this is not 100%
consistent.</p>

<p>ENOENT SIOCGSTAMP was called on a socket where no packet
arrived.</p>

<p>ENOPKG A kernel subsystem was not configured.</p>

<p>ENOPROTOOPT and EOPNOTSUPP Invalid socket option
passed.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The operation is only defined on a connected
socket, but the socket wasnt connected.</p>

<p>EPERM User doesnt have permission to set high priority,
change con- figuration, or send signals to the requested
process or group.</p>

<p>EPIPE The connection was unexpectedly closed or shut
down by the other end.</p>

<p>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT The socket is not configured or an
unknown socket type was requested.</p>

<p>Other errors may be generated by the overlaying
protocols; see tcp(7), raw(7), udp(7) and socket(7).</p>

<p>NOTES IP_FREEBIND, IP_MSFILTER, IP_MTU, IP_MTU_DISCOVER,
IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR, IP_PKTINFO, IP_RECVERR, IP_ROUTER_ALERT,
and IP_TRANSPARENT are Linux- specific and should not be
used in programs intended to be portable. Be very careful
with the SO_BROADCAST option - it is not privileged in
Linux. It is easy to overload the network with careless
broadcasts. For new application protocols it is better to
use a multicast group instead of broadcasting. Broadcasting
is discouraged.</p>

<p>Some other BSD sockets implementations provide
IP_RCVDSTADDR and IP_RECVIF socket options to get the
destination address and the interface of received datagrams.
Linux has the more general IP_PKTINFO for the same task.</p>

<p>Some BSD sockets implementations also provide an
IP_RECVTTL option, but an ancillary message with type
IP_RECVTTL is passed with the incoming packet. This is
different from the IP_TTL option used in Linux.</p>

<p>Using SOL_IP socket options level isnt portable,
BSD-based stacks use IPPROTO_IP level.</p>

<p>Compatibility For compatibility with Linux 2.0, the
obsolete socket(AF_INET, SOCK_PACKET, protocol) syntax is
still supported to open a packet(7) socket. This is
deprecated and should be replaced by socket(AF_PACKET,
SOCK_RAW, protocol) instead. The main difference is the new
sock- addr_ll address structure for generic link layer
information instead of the old sockaddr_pkt.</p>

<p>BUGS There are too many inconsistent error values.</p>

<p>The ioctls to configure IP-specific interface options
and ARP tables are not described.</p>

<p>Some versions of glibc forget to declare in_pktinfo.
Workaround cur- rently is to copy it into your program from
this man page.</p>

<p>Receiving the original destination address with
MSG_ERRQUEUE in msg_name by recvmsg(2) does not work in some
2.2 kernels.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO recvmsg(2), sendmsg(2), byteorder(3), ipfw(4),
capabilities(7), netlink(7), raw(7), socket(7), tcp(7),
udp(7)</p>

the IPv4 host requirements. RFC 1812 for the IPv4 router
requirements.</p>
