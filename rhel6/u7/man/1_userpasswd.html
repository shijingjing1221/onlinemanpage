<p>NAME userpasswd - A graphical tool to allow users to
change their passwords.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS userpasswd [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION userpasswd is a graphical tool to allow
users to easily change their passwords. Aside from being a
nice GUI frontend, this program does the right thing when
the pam configuration has changed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This program has no command line options of its
own, but it does take the standard X program options like
-display and such. See the X(1) man page for some of the
common options.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO userhelper(8)</p>

<p>BUGS No known bugs, but compatibility with bizarre
changes in the pam con- figuration have not been tested
aggressively. If you have a non-stan- dard pam
configuration, Id be interested to hear whether it worked
and what kind of configuration you have.</p>
