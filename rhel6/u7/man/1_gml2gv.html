<p>NAME gml2gv - GML-DOT converter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gml2gv [ -? ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gml2gv converts a graph specified in the GML
format to a graph in the GV (formerly DOT) format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-? Prints usage information and exits.</p>

<p>-ooutfile Prints output to the file outfile. If not
given, gml2gv uses stdout.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in GML.
If no files operand is specified, the standard input will be
used.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES Return 0 if there were no problems during
conversion; and non-zero if any error occurred.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS As both the graph and graphics models of GV
and GML differ signifi- cantly, the conversion is at best
approximate. In particular, it is not clear how multiedges
are differentiated in GML, so multiedges are cre- ated in GV
with no user-available key. Also, no attribute information
is lost, in that any GML attributes that arent converted to
GV equiva- lents are retained as attributes in the output
graph.</p>
