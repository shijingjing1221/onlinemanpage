<p>WIRELESS(7) Linux Programmer s Manual WIRELESS(7)</p>

<p>NAME wireless - Wireless Tools and Wireless
Extensions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS iwconfig iwpriv -a</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Wireless Extensions is an API allowing
you manipulate Wireless LAN networking interfaces. It is
composed of a variety of tools and con- figuration files. It
is documented in more detail in the Linux Wireless LAN
Howto. The Wireless Tools are used to change the
configuration of wireless LAN networking interfaces on the
fly, to get their current configuration, to get statistics
and diagnose them. They are described in their own man page,
see below for references. Wireless configuration is specific
to each Linux distribution. This man page will contain in
the future the configuration procedure for a few common
distributions. For the time being, check the file DISTRIBU-
TIONS.txt included with the Wireless Tools package.</p>
