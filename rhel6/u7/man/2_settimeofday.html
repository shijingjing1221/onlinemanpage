<p>GETTIMEOFDAY(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETTIMEOFDAY(2)</p>

<p>NAME gettimeofday, settimeofday - get / set time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone
*tz);</p>

<p>int settimeofday(const struct timeval *tv, const struct
timezone *tz);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>settimeofday(): _BSD_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The functions gettimeofday() and
settimeofday() can get and set the time as well as a
timezone. The tv argument is a struct timeval (as specified
in &lt;sys/time.h&gt;):</p>

<p>struct timeval { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */
suseconds_t tv_usec; /* microseconds */ };</p>

<p>and gives the number of seconds and microseconds since
the Epoch (see time(2)). The tz argument is a struct
timezone:</p>

<p>struct timezone { int tz_minuteswest; /* minutes west of
Greenwich */ int tz_dsttime; /* type of DST correction */
};</p>

<p>If either tv or tz is NULL, the corresponding structure
is not set or returned.</p>

<p>The use of the timezone structure is obsolete; the tz
argument should normally be specified as NULL. The
tz_dsttime field has never been used under Linux; it has not
been and will not be supported by libc or glibc. Each and
every occurrence of this field in the kernel source (other
than the declaration) is a bug. Thus, the following is
purely of historic interest.</p>

<p>The field tz_dsttime contains a symbolic constant
(values are given below) that indicates in which part of the
year Daylight Saving Time is in force. (Note: its value is
constant throughout the year: it does not indicate that DST
is in force, it just selects an algorithm.) The daylight
saving time algorithms defined are as follows :</p>

<p>DST_NONE /* not on dst */ DST_USA /* USA style dst */
DST_AUST /* Australian style dst */ DST_WET /* Western
European dst */ DST_MET /* Middle European dst */ DST_EET /*
Eastern European dst */ DST_CAN /* Canada */ DST_GB /* Great
Britain and Eire */ DST_RUM /* Rumania */ DST_TUR /* Turkey
*/ DST_AUSTALT /* Australian style with shift in 1986 */</p>

<p>Of course it turned out that the period in which
Daylight Saving Time is in force cannot be given by a simple
algorithm, one per country; indeed, this period is
determined by unpredictable political decisions. So this
method of representing timezones has been abandoned. Under
Linux, in a call to settimeofday() the tz_dsttime field
should be zero.</p>

<p>Under Linux there are some peculiar &quot;warp
clock&quot; semantics associated with the settimeofday()
system call if on the very first call (after booting) that
has a non-NULL tz argument, the tv argument is NULL and the
tz_minuteswest field is non-zero. In such a case it is
assumed that the CMOS clock is on local time, and that it
has to be incremented by this amount to get UTC system time.
No doubt it is a bad idea to use this feature.</p>

<p>Macros for operating on timeval structures are described
in timer- add(3).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE gettimeofday() and settimeofday() return 0
for success, or -1 for fail- ure (in which case errno is set
appropriately).</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT One of tv or tz pointed outside the
accessible address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL Timezone (or something else) is invalid.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to
call settime- ofday(); under Linux the CAP_SYS_TIME
capability is required.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD. POSIX.1-2001 describes
gettimeofday() but not settimeof- day(). POSIX.1-2008 marks
gettimeofday() as obsolete, recomending the use of
clock_gettime(2) instead.</p>

<p>NOTES Traditionally, the fields of struct timeval were
of type long.</p>
