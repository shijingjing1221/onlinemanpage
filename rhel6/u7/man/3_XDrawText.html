<p>XDrawText(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XDrawText(3)</p>

<p>NAME XDrawText, XDrawText16, XTextItem, XTextItem16 -
draw polytext text and text drawing structures</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XDrawText(Display *display, Drawable d, GC
gc, int x, int y, XTex- tItem *items, int nitems);</p>

<p>int XDrawText16(Display *display, Drawable d, GC gc, int
x, int y, XTextItem16 *items, int nitems);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS d Specifies the drawable.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>items Specifies an array of text items.</p>

<p>nitems Specifies the number of text items in the
array.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
to the origin of the specified drawable and define the
origin of the first character.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XDrawText16 function is similar to
XDrawText except that it uses 2-byte or 16-bit characters.
Both functions allow complex spacing and font shifts between
counted strings.</p>

<p>Each text item is processed in turn. A font member other
than None in an item causes the font to be stored in the GC
and used for subsequent text. A text element delta specifies
an additional change in the posi- tion along the x axis
before the string is drawn. The delta is always added to the
character origin and is not dependent on any characteris-
tics of the font. Each character image, as defined by the
font in the GC, is treated as an additional mask for a fill
operation on the draw- able. The drawable is modified only
where the font character has a bit set to 1. If a text item
generates a BadFont error, the previous text items may have
been drawn.</p>

<p>For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than
2-byte matrix index- ing, each XChar2b structure is
interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most
significant byte.</p>

<p>Both functions use these GC components: function,
plane-mask, fill- style, font, subwindow-mode,
clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip- mask. They also use
these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,
tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-
origin.</p>

<p>XDrawText and XDrawText16 can generate BadDrawable,
BadFont, BadGC, and BadMatch errors.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XTextItem and XTextItem16 structures
contain:</p>

<p>typedef struct { char *chars; /* pointer to string */
int nchars; /* number of characters */ int delta; /* delta
between strings */ Font font; /* Font to print it in, None
don t change */ } XTextItem;</p>

<p>typedef struct { XChar2b *chars; /* pointer to two-byte
characters */ int nchars; /* number of characters */ int
delta; /* delta between strings */ Font font; /* font to
print it in, None don t change */ } XTextItem16;</p>

<p>If the font member is not None, the font is changed
before printing and also is stored in the GC. If an error
was generated during text draw- ing, the previous items may
have been drawn. The baseline of the char- acters are drawn
starting at the x and y coordinates that you pass in the
text drawing functions.</p>

<p>For example, consider the background rectangle drawn by
XDrawIm- ageString. If you want the upper-left corner of the
background rectan- gle to be at pixel coordinate (x,y), pass
the (x,y + ascent) as the baseline origin coordinates to the
text functions. The ascent is the font ascent, as given in
the XFontStruct structure. If you want the lower-left corner
of the background rectangle to be at pixel coordinate (x,y),
pass the (x,y - descent + 1) as the baseline origin
coordinates to the text functions. The descent is the font
descent, as given in the XFontStruct structure.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadFont A value for a Font or GContext argument does not
name a defined Font.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>
