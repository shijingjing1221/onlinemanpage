<p>INTRO(3) Linux Programmer s Manual INTRO(3)</p>

<p>NAME intro - Introduction to library functions</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Section 3 of the manual describes all
library functions excluding the library functions (system
call wrappers) described in section 2, which implement
system calls.</p>

<p>Many of the functions described in the section are part
of the Standard C Library (libc). Some functions are part of
other libraries (e.g., the math library, libm, or the
real-time library, librt) in which case the manual page will
indicate the linker option needed to link against the
required library (e.g., -lm and -lrt, respectively, for the
afore- mentioned libraries).</p>

<p>In some cases, the programmer must define a feature test
macro in order to obtain the declaration of a function from
the header file specified in the man page SYNOPSIS section.
In such cases, the required macro is described in the man
page. For further information on feature test macros, see
feature_test_macros(7).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Certain terms and abbreviations are used
to indicate Unix variants and standards to which calls in
this section conform. See standards(7).</p>

<p>NOTES Authors and Copyright Terms Look at the header of
the manual page source for the author(s) and copyright
conditions. Note that these can be different from page to
page!</p>
