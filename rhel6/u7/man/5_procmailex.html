<p>NAME procmailex - procmail rcfile examples</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $HOME/.procmailrc examples</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For a description of the rcfile format see
procmailrc(5).</p>

<p>The weighted scoring technique is described in detail in
the proc- mailsc(5) man page.</p>

<p>This man page shows several example recipes. For
examples of complete rcfiles you can check the NOTES section
in procmail(1), or look at the example rcfiles part of the
procmail source distribution (proc-
mail*/examples/?procmailrc).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Sort out all mail coming from the scuba-dive
mailing list into the mailfolder scubafile (uses the
locallockfile scubafile.lock).</p>

<p>:0: * ^TOscuba scubafile</p>

<p>Forward all mail from peter about compilers to william
(and keep a copy of it here in petcompil).</p>

<p>:0 * ^From.*peter * ^Subject:.*compilers { :0 c !
william@somewhere.edu</p>

<p>:0 petcompil }</p>

<p>An equivalent solution that accomplishes the same:</p>

<p>:0 c * ^From.*peter * ^Subject:.*compilers !
william@somewhere.edu</p>

<p>:0 A petcompil</p>

<p>An equivalent, but slightly slower solution that
accomplishes the same:</p>

<p>:0 c * ^From.*peter * ^Subject:.*compilers !
william@somewhere.edu</p>

<p>:0 * ^From.*peter * ^Subject:.*compilers petcompil</p>

<p>If you are fairly new to procmail and plan to experiment
a little bit it often helps to have a safety net of some
sort. Inserting the fol- lowing two recipes above all other
recipes will make sure that of all arriving mail always the
last 32 messages will be preserved. In order for it to work
as intended, you have to create a directory named backup in
$MAILDIR prior to inserting these two recipes.</p>

<p>:0 c backup</p>

<p>:0 ic | cd backup &amp;&amp; rm -f dummy ls -t msg.* |
sed -e 1,32d</p>

<p>If your system doesn t generate or generates incorrect
leading From lines on every mail, you can fix this by
calling up procmail with the -f- option. To fix the same
problem by different means, you could have inserted the
following two recipes above all other recipes in your
rcfile. They will filter the header of any mail through
formail which will strip any leading From , and
automatically regenerates it subse- quently.</p>

<p>:0 fhw | formail -I &quot;From &quot; -a &quot;From
&quot;</p>

<p>Add the headers of all messages that didnt come from the
postmaster to your private header collection (for statistics
or mail debugging); and use the lockfile headc.lock. In
order to make sure the lockfile is not removed until the
pipe has finished, you have to specify option w ; otherwise
the lockfile would be removed as soon as the pipe has
accepted the mail.</p>

<p>:0 hwc: * !^FROM_MAILER | uncompress headc.Z; cat
&gt;&gt;headc; compress headc</p>

<p>Or, if you would use the more efficient gzip instead of
compress:</p>

<p>:0 hwc: * !^FROM_MAILER | gzip &gt;&gt;headc.gz</p>

<p>Forward all mails shorter than 1000 bytes to my home
address (no lock- file needed on this recipe).</p>

<p>:0 * &lt; 1000 ! myname@home</p>

<p>Split up incoming digests from the surfing mailing list
into their individual messages, and store them into surfing,
using surfing.lock as the locallockfile.</p>

<p>:0: * ^Subject:.*surfing.*Digest | formail +1 -ds
&gt;&gt;surfing</p>

<p>Store everything coming from the postmaster or
mailer-daemon (like bounced mail) into the file postm, using
postm.lock as the locallock- file.</p>

<p>:0: * ^FROM_MAILER postm</p>

<p>A simple autoreply recipe. It makes sure that neither
mail from any daemon (like bouncing mail or mail from
mailing-lists), nor autoreplies coming from yourself will be
autoreplied to. If this precaution would not be taken,
disaster could result (ringing mail). In order for this
recipe to autoreply to all the incoming mail, you should of
course insert it before all other recipes in your rcfile.
However, it is advisable to put it after any recipes that
process the mails from sub- scribed mailinglists; it
generally is not a good idea to generate autoreplies to
mailinglists (yes, the !^FROM_DAEMON regexp should already
catch those, but if the mailinglist doesnt follow accepted
conventions, this might not be enough).</p>

<p>:0 h c * !^FROM_DAEMON * !^X-Loop: your@own.mail.address
| (formail -r -I&quot;Precedence: junk&quot; -A&quot;X-Loop:
your@own.mail.address&quot; ; echo &quot;Mail
received.&quot;) | $SENDMAIL -t</p>

<p>A more complicated autoreply recipe that implements the
functional equivalent of the well known vacation(1) program.
This recipe is based on the same principles as the last one
(prevent ringing mail). In addition to that however, it
maintains a vacation database by extract- ing the name of
the sender and inserting it in the vacation.cache file if
the name was new (the vacation.cache file is maintained by
formail which will make sure that it always contains the
most recent names, the size of the file is limited to a
maximum of approximately 8192 bytes). If the name was new,
an autoreply will be sent.</p>

<p>As you can see, the following recipe has comments
between the condi- tions. This is allowed. Do not put
comments on the same line as a condition though.</p>

<p>SHELL=/bin/sh # for other shells, this might need
adjustment</p>

<p>:0 Whc: vacation.lock # Perform a quick check to see if
the mail was addressed to us * $^To:.*&lt;$NAME&gt; # Dont
reply to daemons and mailinglists * !^FROM_DAEMON # Mail
loops are evil * !^X-Loop: your@own.mail.address | formail
-rD 8192 vacation.cache</p>

<p>:0 ehc # if the name was not in the cache | (formail
-rI&quot;Precedence: junk&quot; -A&quot;X-Loop:
your@own.mail.address&quot; ; echo &quot;I received your
mail,&quot;; echo &quot;but I wont be back until
Monday.&quot;; echo &quot;-- &quot;; cat $HOME/.signature )
| $SENDMAIL -oi -t</p>

<p>Store all messages concerning TeX in separate, unique
filenames, in a directory named texmail (this directory has
to exist); there is no need to use lockfiles in this case,
so we wont.</p>

<p>:0 * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t] texmail</p>

<p>The same as above, except now we store the mails in
numbered files (MH mail folder).</p>

<p>:0 * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t] texmail/.</p>

<p>Or you could file the mail in several directory folders
at the same time. The following recipe will deliver the mail
to two MH-folders and one directory folder. It is actually
only one file with two extra hardlinks.</p>

<p>:0 * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t] texmail/. wordprocessing
dtp/.</p>

<p>Store all the messages about meetings in a folder that
is in a direc- tory that changes every month. E.g. if it
were January 1994, the folder would have the name
94-01/meeting and the locallockfile would be
94-01/meeting.lock.</p>

<p>:0: * meeting date +%y-%m/meeting</p>

<p>The same as above, but, if the 94-01 directory wouldn t
have existed, it is created automatically:</p>

<p>MONTHFOLDER=date +%y-%m</p>

<p>:0 Wic * ? test ! -d $MONTHFOLDER | mkdir
$MONTHFOLDER</p>

<p>:0: * meeting ${MONTHFOLDER}/meeting</p>

<p>The same as above, but now by slightly different
means:</p>

<p>MONTHFOLDER=date +%y-%m DUMMY=test -d $MONTHFOLDER ||
mkdir $MONTHFOLDER</p>

<p>:0: * meeting ${MONTHFOLDER}/meeting</p>

<p>If you are subscribed to several mailinglists and people
cross-post to some of them, you usually receive several
duplicate mails (one from every list). The following simple
recipe eliminates duplicate mails. It tells formail to keep
an 8KB cache file in which it will store the Message-IDs of
the most recent mails you received. Since Message-IDs are
guaranteed to be unique for every new mail, they are ideally
suited to weed out duplicate mails. Simply put the following
recipe at the top of your rcfile, and no duplicate mail will
get past it.</p>

<p>:0 Wh: msgid.lock | formail -D 8192 msgid.cache</p>

<p>Beware if you have delivery problems in recipes below
this one and procmail tries to requeue the mail, then on the
next queue run, this mail will be considered a duplicate and
will be thrown away. For those not quite so confident in
their own scripting capabilities, you can use the following
recipe instead. It puts duplicates in a separate folder
instead of throwing them away. It is up to you to
periodically empty the folder of course.</p>

<p>:0 Whc: msgid.lock | formail -D 8192 msgid.cache</p>

<p>:0 a: duplicates</p>

<p>Procmail can deliver to MH folders directly, but, it
does not update the unseen sequences the real MH manages. If
you want procmail to update those as well, use a recipe like
the following which will file everything that contains the
word spam in the body of the mail into an MH folder called
spamfold. Note the local lockfile, which is needed because
MH programs do not lock the sequences file. Asynchronous
invo- cations of MH programs that change the sequences file
may therefore corrupt it or silently lose changes.
Unfortunately, the lockfile doesn t completely solve the
problem as rcvstore could be invoked while show or mark or
some other MH program is running. This problem is expected
to be fixed in some future version of MH, but until then,
youll have to balance the risk of lost or corrupt sequences
against the benefits of the unseen sequence.</p>

<p>:0 :spamfold/$LOCKEXT * B ?? spam | rcvstore
+spamfold</p>

<p>When delivering to emacs folders (i.e., mailfolders
managed by any emacs mail package, e.g., RMAIL or VM)
directly, you should use emacs- compatible lockfiles. The
emacs mailers are a bit braindamaged in that respect, they
get very upset if someone delivers to mailfolders which they
already have in their internal buffers. The following recipe
assumes that $HOME equals /home/john.</p>

<p>MAILDIR=Mail</p>

<p>:0:/usr/local/lib/emacs/lock/!home!john!Mail!mailbox *
^Subject:.*whatever mailbox</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can have procmail deliver into its
own set of mail- boxes, which you then periodically empty
and copy over to your emacs files using movemail. Movemail
uses mailbox.lock local lockfiles per mailbox. This actually
is the preferred mode of operation in conjunc- tion with
procmail.</p>

<p>To extract certain headers from a mail and put them into
environment variables you can use any of the following
constructs:</p>

<p>SUBJECT=formail -xSubject: # regular field FROM=formail
-rt -xTo: # special case</p>

<p>:0 h # alternate method KEYWORDS=| formail
-xKeywords:</p>

<p>If you are using temporary files in a procmailrc file,
and want to make sure that they are removed just before
procmail exits, you could use something along the lines
of:</p>

<p>TEMPORARY=$HOME/tmp/pmail.$$ TRAP=&quot;/bin/rm -f
$TEMPORARY&quot;</p>

<p>The TRAP keyword can also be used to change the exitcode
of procmail. I.e. if you want procmail to return an exitcode
of 1 instead of its regular exitcodes, you could use:</p>

<p>EXITCODE=&quot;&quot; TRAP=&quot;exit 1;&quot; # The
trailing semi-colon is important # since exit is not a
standalone program</p>

<p>Or, if the exitcode does not need to depend on the
programs run from the TRAP, you can use a mere:</p>

<p>EXITCODE=1</p>

<p>The following recipe prints every incoming mail that
looks like a postscript file.</p>

<p>:0 Bb * ^^%! | lpr</p>

<p>The following recipe does the same, but is a bit more
selective. It only prints the postscript file if it comes
from the print-server. The first condition matches only if
it is found in the header. The second condition only matches
at the start of the body.</p>

<p>:0 b * ^From[ :].*print-server * B ?? ^^%! | lpr</p>

<p>The same as above, but now by slightly different
means:</p>

<p>:0 * ^From[ :].*print-server { :0 B b * ^^%! | lpr }</p>

<p>Likewise:</p>

<p>:0 HB b * ^^(.+$)*From[ :].*print-server * ^^(.+$)*^%! |
lpr</p>

<p>Suppose you have two accounts, you use both accounts
regularly, but they are in very distinct places (i.e., you
can only read mail that arrived at either one of the
accounts). You would like to forward mail arriving at
account one to account two, and the other way around. The
first thing that comes to mind is using .forward files at
both sites; this wont work of course, since you will be
creating a mail loop. This mail loop can be avoided by
inserting the following recipe in front of all other recipes
in the $HOME/.procmailrc files on both sites. If you make
sure that you add the same X-Loop: field at both sites, mail
can now safely be forwarded to the other account from either
of them.</p>

<p>:0 c * !^X-Loop: yourname@your.main.mail.address |
formail -A &quot;X-Loop:
yourname@your.main.mail.address&quot; | $SENDMAIL -oi
yourname@the.other.account</p>

<p>If someone sends you a mail with the word retrieve in
the subject, the following will automatically send back the
contents of info_file to the sender. Like in all recipes
where we send mail, we watch out for mail loops.</p>

<p>:0 * !^From +YOUR_USERNAME * !^Subject:.*Re: *
!^FROM_DAEMON * ^Subject:.*retrieve | (formail -r ; cat
info_file) | $SENDMAIL -oi -t</p>

<p>Now follows an example for a very simple fileserver
accessible by mail. For more demanding applications, I
suggest you take a look at SmartList (available from the
same place as the procmail distribution). As listed, this
fileserver sends back at most one file per request, it
ignores the body of incoming mails, the Subject: line has to
look like &quot;Subject: send file the_file_you_want&quot;
(the blanks are significant), it does not return files that
have names starting with a dot, nor does it allow files to
be retrieved that are outside the fileserver directory tree
(if you decide to munge this example, make sure you do not
inad- vertently loosen this last restriction).</p>

<p>:0 * ^Subject: send file [0-9a-z] * !^X-Loop:
yourname@your.main.mail.address * !^Subject:.*Re: *
!^FROM_DAEMON * !^Subject: send file .*[/.]. {
MAILDIR=$HOME/fileserver # chdir to the fileserver
directory</p>

<p>:0 fhw # reverse mailheader and extract name * ^Subject:
send file [^ ]* | formail -rA &quot;X-Loop:
yourname@your.main.mail.address&quot;</p>

<p>FILE=&quot;$MATCH&quot; # the requested filename</p>

<p>:0 ah | cat - ./$FILE 2&gt;&amp;1 | $SENDMAIL -oi -t
}</p>

<p>The following example preconverts all plain-text mail
arriving in cer- tain encoded MIME formats into a more
compact 8-bit format which can be used and displayed more
easily by most programs. The mimencode(1) pro- gram is part
of Nathaniel Borensteins metamail package.</p>

<p>:0 * ^Content-Type: *text/plain { :0 fbw *
^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *quoted-printable | mimencode -u
-q</p>

<p>:0 Afhw | formail -I &quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding:
8bit&quot;</p>

<p>:0 fbw * ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *base64 | mimencode
-u -b</p>

<p>:0 Afhw | formail -I &quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding:
8bit&quot; }</p>

<p>The following one is rather exotic, but it only serves
to demonstrate a feature. Suppose you have a file in your
HOME directory called &quot;.urgent&quot;, and the (one)
person named in that file is the sender of an incoming mail,
you d like that mail to be stored in $MAILDIR/urgent instead
of in any of the normal mailfolders it would have been
sorted in. Then this is what you could do (beware, the
filelength of $HOME/.urgent should be well below $LINEBUF,
increase LINEBUF if neces- sary):</p>

<p>URGMATCH=cat $HOME/.urgent</p>

<p>:0: * $^From.*${URGMATCH} urgent</p>

<p>An entirely different application for procmail would be
to condition- ally apply filters to a certain (outgoing)
text or mail. A typical example would be a filter through
which you pipe all outgoing mail, in order to make sure that
it will be MIME encoded only if it needs to be. I.e. in this
case you could start procmail in the middle of a pipe
like:</p>

<p>cat newtext | procmail ./mimeconvert | mail
chris@where.ever</p>

<p>The mimeconvert rcfile could contain something like (the
=0x80= and =0xff= should be substituted with the real 8-bit
characters):</p>

<p>DEFAULT=| # pipe to stdout instead of # delivering mail
as usual :0 Bfbw * [=0x80=-=0xff=] | mimencode -q</p>

<p>:0 Afhw | formail -I MIME-Version: 1.0 -I Content-Type:
text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 -I Content-Transfer-Encoding:
quoted-printable</p>
