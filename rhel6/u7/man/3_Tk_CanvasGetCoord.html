<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Canvas canvas (in) A token that identifies
a can- vas widget.</p>

<p>Tcl_Interp *interp (in/out) Interpreter to use for error
reporting.</p>

<p>const char *string (in) Textual description of a canvas
coordinate.</p>

<p>double *doublePtr (out) Points to place to store a con-
verted coordinate.</p>

<p>double x (in) An x coordinate in the space of the
canvas.</p>

<p>double y (in) A y coordinate in the space of the
canvas.</p>

<p>short *drawableXPtr (out) Pointer to a location in which
to store an x coordinate in the space of the drawable
currently being used to redisplay the canvas.</p>

<p>short *drawableYPtr (out) Pointer to a location in which
to store a y coordinate in the space of the drawable
currently being used to redisplay the canvas.</p>

<p>GC gc (out) Graphics context to modify.</p>

<p>short *screenXPtr (out) Points to a location in which to
store the screen coordinate in the canvas window that cor-
responds to x.</p>

<p>short *screenYPtr (out) Points to a location in which to
store the screen coordinate in the canvas window that cor-
responds to y.</p>

<p>int x1 (in) Left edge of the region that needs
redisplay. Only pixels at or to the right of this coordinate
need to be redis- played.</p>

<p>int y1 (in) Top edge of the region that needs redisplay.
Only pixels at or below this coordinate need to be
redisplayed.</p>

<p>int x2 (in) Right edge of the region that needs
redisplay. Only pixels to the left of this coordinate need
to be redisplayed.</p>

<p>int y2 (in) Bottom edge of the region that needs
redisplay. Only pixels above this coordinate need to be
redisplayed.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are called by canvas type
managers to perform various utility functions.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasTkwin returns the Tk_Window associated with a
particular can- vas.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasGetCoord translates a string specification of a
coordinate (such as 2p or 1.6c) into a double-precision
canvas coordinate. If string is a valid coordinate
description then Tk_CanvasGetCoord stores the corresponding
canvas coordinate at *doublePtr and returns TCL_OK.
Otherwise it stores an error message in interp-&gt;result
and returns TCL_ERROR.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords is called by type managers
during redisplay to compute where to draw things. Given x
and y coordinates in the space of the canvas,
Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords computes the corresponding pixel in
the drawable that is currently being used for redisplay; it
returns those coordinates in *drawableXPtr and
*drawableYPtr. This procedure should not be invoked except
during redisplay.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin is also used during redisplay.
It sets the stipple origin in gc so that stipples drawn with
gc in the current off- screen pixmap will line up with
stipples drawn with origin (0,0) in the canvass actual
window. Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin is needed in order to
guarantee that stipple patterns line up properly when the
canvas is redisplayed in small pieces. Redisplays are
carried out in double- buffered fashion where a piece of the
canvas is redrawn in an offscreen pixmap and then copied
back onto the screen. In this approach the stipple origins
in graphics contexts need to be adjusted during each
redisplay to compensate for the position of the off-screen
pixmap rela- tive to the window. If an item is being drawn
with stipples, its type manager typically calls
Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin just before using gc to draw
something; after it is finished drawing, the type manager
calls XSetTSOrigin to restore the origin in gc back to (0,0)
(the restore is needed because graphics contexts are shared,
so they cannot be modified permanently).</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasWindowCoords is similar to
Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords except that it returns coordinates
in the canvas s window on the screen, instead of coordinates
in an off-screen pixmap.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw may be invoked by a type
manager to inform Tk that a portion of a canvas needs to be
redrawn. The x1, y1, x2, and y2 arguments specify the region
that needs to be redrawn, in canvas coor- dinates. Type
managers rarely need to invoke Tk_CanvasEventuallyRe- draw,
since Tk can normally figure out when an item has changed
and make the redisplay request on its behalf (this happens,
for example whenever Tk calls a configureProc or scaleProc).
The only time that a type manager needs to call
Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw is if an item has changed on its
own without being invoked through one of the procedures in
its Tk_ItemType; this could happen, for example, in an image
item if the image is modified using image commands.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasTagsParseProc and Tk_CanvasTagsPrintProc are
procedures that handle the -tags option for canvas items.
The code of a canvas type manager will not call these
procedures directly, but will use their addresses to create
a Tk_CustomOption structure for the -tags option. The code
typically looks like this: static Tk_CustomOption tagsOption
= {Tk_CanvasTagsParseProc, Tk_CanvasTagsPrintProc,
(ClientData) NULL };</p>

<p>static Tk_ConfigSpec configSpecs[] = { ...
{TK_CONFIG_CUSTOM, &quot;-tags&quot;, (char *) NULL, (char
*) NULL, (char *) NULL, 0, TK_CONFIG_NULL_OK,
&amp;tagsOption}, ... };</p>
