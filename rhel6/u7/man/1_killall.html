<p>KILLALL(1) User Commands KILLALL(1)</p>

<p>NAME killall - kill processes by name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS killall [-Z,--context pattern] [-e,--exact]
[-g,--process-group] [-i,--interactive] [-q,--quiet]
[-r,--regexp] [-s,--signal signal] [-u,--user user]
[-v,--verbose] [-w,--wait] [-I,--ignore-case] [-V,--version]
[--] name ... killall -l killall -V,--version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION killall sends a signal to all processes
running any of the specified commands. If no signal name is
specified, SIGTERM is sent.</p>

<p>Signals can be specified either by name (e.g. -HUP or
-SIGHUP ) or by number (e.g. -1) or by option -s.</p>

<p>If the command name is not regular expression (option
-r) and contains a slash (/), processes executing that
particular file will be selected for killing, independent of
their name.</p>

<p>killall returns a zero return code if at least one
process has been killed for each listed command, or no
commands were listed and at least one process matched the -u
and -Z search criteria. killall returns non- zero
otherwise.</p>

<p>A killall process never kills itself (but may kill other
killall pro- cesses).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -e, --exact Require an exact match for very long
names. If a command name is longer than 15 characters, the
full name may be unavailable (i.e. it is swapped out). In
this case, killall will kill every- thing that matches
within the first 15 characters. With -e, such entries are
skipped. killall prints a message for each skipped entry if
-v is specified in addition to -e,</p>

<p>-I, --ignore-case Do case insensitive process name
match.</p>

<p>-g, --process-group Kill the process group to which the
process belongs. The kill signal is only sent once per
group, even if multiple processes belonging to the same
process group were found.</p>

<p>-i, --interactive Interactively ask for confirmation
before killing.</p>

<p>-l, --list List all known signal names.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Do not complain if no processes were
killed.</p>

<p>-r, --regexp Interpret process name pattern as an
extended regular expres- sion.</p>

<p>-s, --signal Send this signal instead of SIGTERM.</p>

<p>-u, --user Kill only processes the specified user owns.
Command names are optional.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Report if the signal was successfully
sent.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version information.</p>

<p>-w, --wait Wait for all killed processes to die. killall
checks once per second if any of the killed processes still
exist and only returns if none are left. Note that killall
may wait forever if the signal was ignored, had no effect,
or if the process stays in zombie state.</p>

<p>-Z, --context (SELinux Only) Specify security context:
kill only processes having security context that match with
given expended regular expression pattern. Must precede
other arguments on the command line. Command names are
optional.</p>

<p>FILES /proc location of the proc file system</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS Killing by file only works for executables
that are kept open during execution, i.e. impure executables
can t be killed this way.</p>

<p>Be warned that typing killall name may not have the
desired effect on non-Linux systems, especially when done by
a privileged user.</p>

<p>killall -w doesn t detect if a process disappears and is
replaced by a new process with the same PID between
scans.</p>

<p>If processes change their name, killall may not be able
to match them correctly.</p>
