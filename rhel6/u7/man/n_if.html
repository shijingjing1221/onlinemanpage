<p>if(n) Tcl Built-In Commands if(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME if - Execute scripts conditionally</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS if expr1 ?then? body1 elseif expr2 ?then? body2
elseif ... ?else? ?bodyN?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The if command evaluates expr1 as an
expression (in the same way that expr evaluates its
argument). The value of the expression must be a boolean (a
numeric value, where 0 is false and anything is true, or a
string value such as true or yes for true and false or no
for false); if it is true then body1 is executed by passing
it to the Tcl inter- preter. Otherwise expr2 is evaluated as
an expression and if it is true then body2 is executed, and
so on. If none of the expressions evaluates to true then
bodyN is executed. The then and else arguments are optional
noise words to make the command easier to read. There may be
any number of elseif clauses, including zero. BodyN may also
be omitted as long as else is omitted too. The return value
from the com- mand is the result of the body script that was
executed, or an empty string if none of the expressions was
non-zero and there was no bodyN.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A simple conditional: if {$vbl == 1} { puts
&quot;vbl is one&quot; }</p>

<p>With an else-clause: if {$vbl == 1} { puts &quot;vbl is
one&quot; } else { puts &quot;vbl is not one&quot; }</p>

<p>With an elseif-clause too: if {$vbl == 1} { puts
&quot;vbl is one&quot; } elseif {$vbl == 2} { puts &quot;vbl
is two&quot; } else { puts &quot;vbl is not one or two&quot;
}</p>

<p>Remember, expressions can be multi-line, but in that
case it can be a good idea to use the optional then keyword
for clarity: if { $vbl == 1 || $vbl == 2 || $vbl == 3 } then
{ puts &quot;vbl is one, two or three&quot; }</p>
