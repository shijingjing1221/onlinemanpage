<p>STRFMON(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STRFMON(3)</p>

<p>NAME strfmon - convert monetary value to a string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;monetary.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t strfmon(char *s, size_t max, const char *format,
...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strfmon() function formats the specified
amounts according to the format specification format and
places the result in the character array s of size max.</p>

<p>Ordinary characters in format are copied to s without
conversion. Con- version specifiers are introduced by a
&rsquo;%&rsquo; character. Immediately fol- lowing it there
can be zero or more of the following flags:</p>

<p>=f The single-byte character f is used as the numeric
fill charac- ter (to be used with a left precision, see
below). When not specified, the space character is used.</p>

<p>^ Do not use any grouping characters that might be
defined for the current locale. By default, grouping is
enabled.</p>

<p>( or + The ( flag indicates that negative amounts should
be enclosed between parentheses. The + flag indicates that
signs should be handled in the default way, that is, amounts
are preceded by the locales sign indication, for example,
nothing for positive, &quot;-&quot; for negative.</p>

<p>! Omit the currency symbol.</p>

<p>- Left justify all fields. The default is right
justification.</p>

<p>Next, there may be a field width: a decimal digit string
specifying a minimum field width in bytes. The default is 0.
A result smaller than this width is padded with spaces (on
the left, unless the left-justify flag was given).</p>

<p>Next, there may be a left precision of the form
&quot;#&quot; followed by a deci- mal digit string. If the
number of digits left of the radix character is smaller than
this, the representation is padded on the left with the
numeric fill character. Grouping characters are not counted
in this field width.</p>

<p>Next, there may be a right precision of the form
&quot;.&quot; followed by a dec- imal digit string. The
amount being formatted is rounded to the speci- fied number
of digits prior to formatting. The default is specified in
the frac_digits and int_frac_digits items of the current
locale. If the right precision is 0, no radix character is
printed. (The radix character here is determined by
LC_MONETARY, and may differ from that specified by
LC_NUMERIC.)</p>

<p>Finally, the conversion specification must be ended with
a conversion character. The three conversion characters
are</p>

<p>% (In this case the entire specification must be exactly
&quot;%%&quot;.) Put a &rsquo;%&rsquo; character in the
result string.</p>

<p>i One argument of type double is converted using the
locales international currency format.</p>

<p>n One argument of type double is converted using the
locales national currency format.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strfmon() function returns the number
of characters placed in the array s, not including the
terminating null byte, provided the string, including the
terminating null byte, fits. Otherwise, it sets errno to
E2BIG, returns -1, and the contents of the array is
undefined.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO Not in POSIX.1-2001. Present on several
other systems.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The call</p>

<p>strfmon(buf, sizeof(buf), &quot;[%^=*#6n]
[%=*#6i]&quot;, 1234.567, 1234.567);</p>

<p>outputs</p>

<p>[ fl **1234,57] [ NLG **1 234,57]</p>

<p>in the Dutch locale (with fl for &quot;florijnen&quot;
and NLG for Netherlands Guilders). The grouping character is
very ugly because it takes as much space as a digit, while
it should not take more than half that, and will no doubt
cause confusion. Surprisingly, the &quot;fl&quot; is
preceded and followed by a space, and &quot;NLG&quot; is
preceded by one and followed by two spaces. This may be a
bug in the locale files. The Italian, Aus- tralian, Swiss
and Portuguese locales yield</p>

<p>[ L. **1235] [ ITL **1.235] [ $**1234.57] [ AUD
**1,234.57] [Fr. **1234,57] [CHF **1.234,57] [ **1234$57Esc]
[ **1.234$57PTE ]</p>
