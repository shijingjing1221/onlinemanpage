<p>SETBUF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETBUF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setbuf - assign buffering to a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>void setbuf(FILE *restrict stream, char *restrict
buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Except that it returns no value, the
function call:</p>

<p>setbuf(stream, buf)</p>

<p>shall be equivalent to:</p>

<p>setvbuf(stream, buf, _IOFBF, BUFSIZ)</p>

<p>if buf is not a null pointer, or to:</p>

<p>setvbuf(stream, buf, _IONBF, BUFSIZ)</p>

<p>if buf is a null pointer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The setbuf() function shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE A common source of error is allocating
buffer space as an &quot;automatic&quot; variable in a code
block, and then failing to close the stream in the same
block.</p>

<p>With setbuf(), allocating a buffer of BUFSIZ bytes does
not necessarily imply that all of BUFSIZ bytes are used for
the buffer area.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO fopen(), setvbuf(), the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
