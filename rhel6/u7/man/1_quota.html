<p>QUOTA(1) QUOTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME quota - display disk usage and limits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS quota [ -F format-name ] [ -guqvswi ] [ -l | [
-QAm ]] quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm ]]
-u user... quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm
]] -g group... quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswugQm ] -f
filesystem...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION quota displays users disk usage and limits.
By default only the user quotas are printed.</p>

<p>quota reports the quotas of all the filesystems listed
in /etc/mtab. For filesystems that are NFS-mounted a call to
the rpc.rquotad on the server machine is performed to get
the information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -F, --format=format-name Show quota for
specified format (ie. dont perform format autodetection).
Possible format names are: vfsold Original quota format with
16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format with 32-bit UIDs /
GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode usage and limits,
vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit quota limits and usage, rpc
(quota over NFS), xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)</p>

<p>-g, --group Print group quotas for the group of which
the user is a member. The optional group argument(s)
restricts the display to the specified group(s).</p>

<p>-u, --user flag is equivalent to the default.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose will display quotas on filesystems where
no storage is allo- cated.</p>

<p>-s, --human-readable option will make quota(1) try to
choose units for showing lim- its, used space and used
inodes.</p>

<p>--always-resolve Always try to translate user / group
name to uid / gid even if the name is composed of digits
only.</p>

<p>-p, --raw-grace When user is in grace period, report
time in seconds since epoch when his grace time runs out (or
has run out). Field is 0 when no grace time is in effect.
This is especially useful when parsing output by a
script.</p>

<p>-i, --no-autofs ignore mountpoints mounted by
automounter</p>

<p>-l, --local-only report quotas only on local filesystems
(ie. ignore NFS mounted filesystems).</p>

<p>-A, --all-nfs report quotas for all NFS filesystems even
if they report to be on the same device.</p>

<p>-m, --no-mixed-pathnames Currently, pathnames of NFSv4
mountpoints are sent without lead- ing slash in the path.
rpc.rquotad uses this to recognize NFSv4 mounts and properly
prepend pseudoroot of NFS filesystem to the path. If you
specify this option, setquota will always send paths with a
trailing slash. This can be useful for legacy rea- sons but
be aware that quota over RPC will stop working if you are
using new rpc.rquotad.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Print a more terse message, containing only
information on filesystems where usage is over quota.</p>

<p>-Q, --quiet-refuse Do not print error message if
connection to rpc.rquotad is refused (usually this happens
when rpc.rquotad is not running on the server).</p>

<p>-w, --no-wrap Do not wrap the line if the device name is
too long. This can be useful when parsing the output of
quota(1) by a script.</p>

<p>Specifying both -g and -u displays both the user quotas
and the group quotas (for the user).</p>

<p>Only the super-user may use the -u flag and the optional
user argument to view the limits of other users.
Non-super-users can use the the -g flag and optional group
argument to view only the limits of groups of which they are
members.</p>

<p>The -q flag takes precedence over the -v flag.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If quota exits with a non-zero status, one
or more filesystems are over quota.</p>

<p>FILES aquota.user or aquota.group quota file at the
filesystem root (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
quota.user or quota.group quota file at the filesystem root
(version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems) /etc/mtab default
filesystems</p>
