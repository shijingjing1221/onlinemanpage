<p>NAME wimax_msg_send - Send a pre-allocated message to
user space</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int wimax_msg_send(struct wimax_dev *
wimax_dev, struct sk_buff * skb);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS wimax_dev WiMAX device descriptor</p>

<p>skb</p>

<p>struct sk_buff returned by wimax_msg_alloc. Note the
ownership of skb is transferred to this function.</p>

<p>RETURNS 0 if ok, &lt; 0 errno code on error</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a free-form message that was
preallocated with wimax_msg_alloc and filled up.</p>

<p>Assumes that once you pass an skb to this function for
sending, it owns it and will release it when done (on
success).</p>

<p>IMPORTANT Don&acute;t use skb_push/skb_pull/skb_reserve
on the skb, as wimax_msg_send depends on skb-&gt;data being
placed at the beginning of the user message.</p>

<p>Unlike other WiMAX stack calls, this call can be used
way early, even before wimax_dev_add is called, as long as
the wimax_dev-&gt;net_dev pointer is set to point to a
proper net_dev. This is so that drivers can use it early in
case they need to send stuff around or communicate with user
space.</p>
