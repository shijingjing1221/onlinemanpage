<p>Tcl_GetStdChannel(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_GetStdChannel(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_GetStdChannel, Tcl_SetStdChannel - procedures
for retrieving and replacing the standard channels</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel Tcl_GetStdChannel(type)</p>

<p>Tcl_SetStdChannel(channel, type)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int type (in) The identifier for the standard
chan- nel to retrieve or modify. Must be one of TCL_STDIN,
TCL_STDOUT, or TCL_STDERR.</p>

<p>Tcl_Channel channel (in) The channel to use as the new
value for the specified standard channel.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl defines three special channels that are
used by various I/O related commands if no other channels
are specified. The standard input chan- nel has a channel
name of stdin and is used by read and gets. The standard
output channel is named stdout and is used by puts. The
stan- dard error channel is named stderr and is used for
reporting errors. In addition, the standard channels are
inherited by any child processes created using exec or open
in the absence of any other redirections.</p>

<p>The standard channels are actually aliases for other
normal channels. The current channel associated with a
standard channel can be retrieved by calling
Tcl_GetStdChannel with one of TCL_STDIN, TCL_STDOUT, or
TCL_STDERR as the type. The return value will be a valid
channel, or NULL.</p>

<p>A new channel can be set for the standard channel
specified by type by calling Tcl_SetStdChannel with a new
channel or NULL in the channel argument. If the specified
channel is closed by a later call to Tcl_Close, then the
corresponding standard channel will automatically be set to
NULL.</p>

<p>If a non-NULL value for channel is passed to
Tcl_SetStdChannel, then that same value should be passed to
Tcl_RegisterChannel, like so: Tcl_RegisterChannel(NULL,
channel); This is a workaround for a misfeature in
Tcl_SetStdChannel that it fails to do some reference
counting housekeeping. This misfeature can- not be corrected
without contradicting the assumptions of some existing code
that calls Tcl_SetStdChannel.</p>

<p>If Tcl_GetStdChannel is called before Tcl_SetStdChannel,
Tcl will con- struct a new channel to wrap the appropriate
platform-specific standard file handle. If Tcl_SetStdChannel
is called before Tcl_GetStdChannel, then the default channel
will not be created.</p>

<p>If one of the standard channels is set to NULL, either
by calling Tcl_SetStdChannel with a NULL channel argument,
or by calling Tcl_Close on the channel, then the next call
to Tcl_CreateChannel will automati- cally set the standard
channel with the newly created channel. If more than one
standard channel is NULL, then the standard channels will be
assigned starting with standard input, followed by standard
output, with standard error being last.</p>

<p>See Tcl_StandardChannels for a general treatise about
standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with
regard to them.</p>
