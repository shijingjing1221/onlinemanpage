<p>XAUTH(1) XAUTH(1)</p>

<p>NAME xauth - X authority file utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xauth [ -f authfile ] [ -vqibn ] [ command arg
... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xauth program is used to edit and
display the authorization infor- mation used in connecting
to the X server. This program is usually used to extract
authorization records from one machine and merge them in on
another (as is the case when using remote logins or granting
access to other users). Commands (described below) may be
entered interactively, on the xauth command line, or in
scripts. Note that this program does not contact the X
server except when the generate command is used. Normally
xauth is not used to create the authority file entry in the
first place; xdm does that.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options may be used with xauth.
They may be given indi- vidually (e.g., -q -i) or may
combined (e.g., -qi).</p>

<p>-f authfile This option specifies the name of the
authority file to use. By default, xauth will use the file
specified by the XAUTHORITY environment variable or
.Xauthority in the users home direc- tory.</p>

<p>-q This option indicates that xauth should operate
quietly and not print unsolicited status messages. This is
the default if an xauth command is given on the command line
or if the standard output is not directed to a terminal.</p>

<p>-v This option indicates that xauth should operate
verbosely and print status messages indicating the results
of various opera- tions (e.g., how many records have been
read in or written out). This is the default if xauth is
reading commands from its standard input and its standard
output is directed to a terminal.</p>

<p>-i This option indicates that xauth should ignore any
authority file locks. Normally, xauth will refuse to read or
edit any authority files that have been locked by other
programs (usu- ally xdm or another xauth).</p>

<p>-b This option indicates that xauth should attempt to
break any authority file locks before proceeding. Use this
option only to clean up stale locks.</p>

<p>-n This option indicates that xauth should not attempt
to resolve any hostnames, but should simply always print the
host address as stored in the authority file.</p>

<p>COMMANDS The following commands may be used to
manipulate authority files:</p>

<p>add displayname protocolname hexkey An authorization
entry for the indicated display using the given protocol and
key data is added to the authorization file. The data is
specified as an even-lengthed string of hexadecimal digits,
each pair representing one octet. The first digit of each
pair gives the most significant 4 bits of the octet, and the
second digit of the pair gives the least significant 4 bits.
For example, a 32 character hexkey would represent a 128-bit
value. A protocol name consisting of just a single period is
treated as an abbreviation for MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.</p>

<p>generate displayname protocolname [trusted|untrusted]
[timeout seconds] [group group-id] [data hexdata]</p>

<p>This command is similar to add. The main difference is
that instead of requiring the user to supply the key data,
it con- nects to the server specified in displayname and
uses the SECU- RITY extension in order to get the key data
to store in the authorization file. If the server cannot be
contacted or if it does not support the SECURITY extension,
the command fails. Otherwise, an authorization entry for the
indicated display using the given protocol is added to the
authorization file. A protocol name consisting of just a
single period is treated as an abbreviation for
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.</p>

<p>If the trusted option is used, clients that connect
using this authorization will have full run of the display,
as usual. If untrusted is used, clients that connect using
this authoriza- tion will be considered untrusted and
prevented from stealing or tampering with data belonging to
trusted clients. See the SECURITY extension specification
for full details on the restrictions imposed on untrusted
clients. The default is untrusted.</p>

<p>The timeout option specifies how long in seconds this
autho- rization will be valid. If the authorization remains
unused (no clients are connected with it) for longer than
this time period, the server purges the authorization, and
future attempts to connect using it will fail. Note that the
purging done by the server does not delete the authorization
entry from the authorization file. The default timeout is 60
seconds.</p>

<p>The group option specifies the application group that
clients connecting with this authorization should belong to.
See the application group extension specification for more
details. The default is to not belong to an application
group.</p>

<p>The data option specifies data that the server should
use to generate the authorization. Note that this is not the
same data that gets written to the authorization file. The
inter- pretation of this data depends on the authorization
protocol. The hexdata is in the same format as the hexkey
described in the add command. The default is to send no
data.</p>

<p>[n]extract filename displayname... Authorization entries
for each of the specified displays are written to the
indicated file. If the nextract command is used, the entries
are written in a numeric format suitable for non-binary
transmission (such as secure electronic mail). The extracted
entries can be read back in using the merge and nmerge
commands. If the filename consists of just a single dash,
the entries will be written to the standard output.</p>

<p>[n]list [displayname...] Authorization entries for each
of the specified displays (or all if no displays are named)
are printed on the standard out- put. If the nlist command
is used, entries will be shown in the numeric format used by
the nextract command; otherwise, they are shown in a textual
format. Key data is always dis- played in the hexadecimal
format given in the description of the add command.</p>

<p>[n]merge [filename...] Authorization entries are read
from the specified files and are merged into the
authorization database, superceding any match- ing existing
entries. If the nmerge command is used, the numeric format
given in the description of the extract command is used. If
a filename consists of just a single dash, the standard
input will be read if it hasnt been read before.</p>

<p>remove displayname... Authorization entries matching the
specified displays are removed from the authority file.</p>

<p>source filename The specified file is treated as a
script containing xauth com- mands to execute. Blank lines
and lines beginning with a sharp sign (#) are ignored. A
single dash may be used to indicate the standard input, if
it hasnt already been read.</p>

<p>info Information describing the authorization file,
whether or not any changes have been made, and from where
xauth commands are being read is printed on the standard
output.</p>

<p>exit If any modifications have been made, the authority
file is written out (if allowed), and the program exits. An
end of file is treated as an implicit exit command.</p>

<p>quit The program exits, ignoring any modifications. This
may also be accomplished by pressing the interrupt
character.</p>

<p>help [string] A description of all commands that begin
with the given string (or all commands if no string is
given) is printed on the stan- dard output.</p>

<p>? A short list of the valid commands is printed on the
standard output.</p>

<p>DISPLAY NAMES Display names for the add, [n]extract,
[n]list, [n]merge, and remove commands use the same format
as the DISPLAY environment variable and the common -display
command line argument. Display-specific informa- tion (such
as the screen number) is unnecessary and will be ignored.
Same-machine connections (such as local-host sockets, shared
memory, and the Internet Protocol hostname localhost) are
referred to as host- name/unix:displaynumber so that local
entries for different machines may be stored in one
authority file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The most common use for xauth is to extract the
entry for the current display, copy it to another machine,
and merge it into the users authority file on the remote
machine:</p>

<p>% xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh otherhost xauth merge
-</p>

<p>The following command contacts the server :0 to create
an authorization using the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 protocol.
Clients that connect with this authorization will be
untrusted. % xauth generate :0 .</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT This xauth program uses the following
environment variables:</p>

<p>XAUTHORITY to get the name of the authority file to use
if the -f option isnt used.</p>

<p>HOME to get the users home directory if XAUTHORITY isnt
defined.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.Xauthority default authority file if
XAUTHORITY isnt defined.</p>

<p>BUGS Users that have unsecure networks should take care
to use encrypted file transfer mechanisms to copy
authorization entries between machines. Similarly, the
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 protocol is not very use- ful in unsecure
environments. Sites that are interested in additional
security may need to use encrypted authorization mechanisms
such as Kerberos.</p>

<p>Spaces are currently not allowed in the protocol name.
Quoting could be added for the truly perverse.</p>
