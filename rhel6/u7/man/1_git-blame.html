<p>NAME git-blame - Show what revision and author last
modified each line of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git blame [-c] [-b] [-l] [--root] [-t] [-f]
[-n] [-s] [-p] [-w] [--incremental] [-L n,m] [-S
&lt;revs-file&gt;] [-M] [-C] [-C] [-C]
[--since=&lt;date&gt;] [&lt;rev&gt; | --contents
&lt;file&gt; | --reverse &lt;rev&gt;] [--] &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Annotates each line in the given file with
information from the revision which last modified the line.
Optionally, start annotating from the given revision.</p>

<p>The command can also limit the range of lines
annotated.</p>

<p>The report does not tell you anything about lines which
have been deleted or replaced; you need to use a tool such
as git diff or the &quot;pickaxe&quot; interface briefly
mentioned in the following paragraph.</p>

<p>Apart from supporting file annotation, git also supports
searching the development history for when a code snippet
occurred in a change. This makes it possible to track when a
code snippet was added to a file, moved or copied between
files, and eventually deleted or replaced. It works by
searching for a text string in the diff. A small
example:</p>

<p>$ git log --pretty=oneline -S&acute;blame_usage&acute;
5040f17eba15504bad66b14a645bddd9b015ebb7 blame -S
&lt;ancestry-file&gt;
ea4c7f9bf69e781dd0cd88d2bccb2bf5cc15c9a7 git-blame: Make the
output</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Show blank SHA-1 for boundary commits. This
can also be controlled via the blame.blankboundary config
option.</p>

<p>--root Do not treat root commits as boundaries. This can
also be controlled via the blame.showroot config option.</p>

<p>--show-stats Include additional statistics at the end of
blame output.</p>

<p>-L &lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt; Annotate only the given
line range. &lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt; can take one of
these forms:</p>

<p>&middot; number</p>

<p>If &lt;start&gt; or &lt;end&gt; is a number, it
specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).</p>

<p>&middot; /regex/</p>

<p>This form will use the first line matching the given
POSIX regex. If &lt;end&gt; is a regex, it will search
starting at the line given by &lt;start&gt;.</p>

<p>&middot; +offset or -offset</p>

<p>This is only valid for &lt;end&gt; and will specify a
number of lines before or after the line given by
&lt;start&gt;.</p>

<p>-l Show long rev (Default: off).</p>

<p>-t Show raw timestamp (Default: off).</p>

<p>-S &lt;revs-file&gt; Use revisions from revs-file
instead of calling git-rev-list(1).</p>

<p>--reverse Walk history forward instead of backward.
Instead of showing the revision in which a line appeared,
this shows the last revision in which a line has existed.
This requires a range of revision like START..END where the
path to blame exists in START.</p>

<p>-p, --porcelain Show in a format designed for machine
consumption.</p>

<p>--incremental Show the result incrementally in a format
designed for machine consumption.</p>

<p>--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt; Specifies the encoding used
to output author names and commit summaries. Setting it to
none makes blame output unconverted data. For more
information see the discussion about encoding in the git-
log(1) manual page.</p>

<p>--contents &lt;file&gt; When &lt;rev&gt; is not
specified, the command annotates the changes starting
backwards from the working tree copy. This flag makes the
command pretend as if the working tree copy has the contents
of the named file (specify - to make the command read from
the standard input).</p>

<p>--date &lt;format&gt; The value is one of the following
alternatives: {relative,local,default,iso,rfc,short}. If
--date is not provided, the value of the blame.date config
variable is used. If the blame.date config variable is also
not set, the iso format is used. For more information, See
the discussion of the --date option at git-log(1).</p>

<p>-M|&lt;num&gt;| Detect moved or copied lines within a
file. When a commit moves or copies a block of lines (e.g.
the original file has A and then B, and the commit changes
it to B and then A), the traditional blame algorithm notices
only half of the movement and typically blames the lines
that were moved up (i.e. B) to the parent and assigns blame
to the lines that were moved down (i.e. A) to the child
commit. With this option, both groups of lines are blamed on
the parent by running extra passes of inspection.</p>

<p>&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the
number of alphanumeric characters that git must detect as
moving within a file for it to associate those lines with
the parent commit.</p>

<p>-C|&lt;num&gt;| In addition to -M, detect lines moved or
copied from other files that were modified in the same
commit. This is useful when you reorganize your program and
move code around across files. When this option is given
twice, the command additionally looks for copies from other
files in the commit that creates the file. When this option
is given three times, the command additionally looks for
copies from other files in any commit.</p>

<p>&lt;num&gt; is optional but it is the lower bound on the
number of alphanumeric characters that git must detect as
moving between files for it to associate those lines with
the parent commit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show help message.</p>

<p>-c Use the same output mode as git-annotate(1) (Default:
off).</p>

<p>--score-debug Include debugging information related to
the movement of lines between files (see -C) and lines moved
within a file (see -M). The first number listed is the
score. This is the number of alphanumeric characters
detected as having been moved between or within files. This
must be above a certain threshold for git blame to consider
those lines of code to have been moved.</p>

<p>-f, --show-name Show the filename in the original
commit. By default the filename is shown if there is any
line that came from a file with a different name, due to
rename detection.</p>

<p>-n, --show-number Show the line number in the original
commit (Default: off).</p>

<p>-s Suppress the author name and timestamp from the
output.</p>

<p>-w Ignore whitespace when comparing the parents version
and the childs to find where the lines came from.</p>

<p>THE PORCELAIN FORMAT In this format, each line is output
after a header; the header at the minimum has the first line
which has:</p>

<p>&middot; 40-byte SHA-1 of the commit the line is
attributed to;</p>

<p>&middot; the line number of the line in the original
file;</p>

<p>&middot; the line number of the line in the final
file;</p>

<p>&middot; on a line that starts a group of lines from a
different commit than the previous one, the number of lines
in this group. On subsequent lines this field is absent.</p>

<p>This header line is followed by the following
information at least once for each commit:</p>

<p>&middot; the author name (&quot;author&quot;), email
(&quot;author-mail&quot;), time (&quot;author-time&quot;),
and timezone (&quot;author-tz&quot;); similarly for
committer.</p>

<p>&middot; the filename in the commit that the line is
attributed to.</p>

<p>&middot; the first line of the commit log message
(&quot;summary&quot;).</p>

<p>The contents of the actual line is output after the
above header, prefixed by a TAB. This is to allow adding
more header elements later.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING RANGES Unlike git blame and git annotate in
older versions of git, the extent of the annotation can be
limited to both line ranges and revision ranges. When you
are interested in finding the origin for lines 40-60 for
file foo, you can use the -L option like so (they mean the
same thing both ask for 21 lines starting at line 40):</p>

<p>git blame -L 40,60 foo git blame -L 40,+21 foo</p>

<p>Also you can use a regular expression to specify the
line range:</p>

<p>git blame -L &acute;/^sub hello {/,/^}$/&acute; foo</p>

<p>which limits the annotation to the body of the hello
subroutine.</p>

<p>When you are not interested in changes older than
version v2.6.18, or changes older than 3 weeks, you can use
revision range specifiers similar to git rev-list:</p>

<p>git blame v2.6.18.. -- foo git blame --since=3.weeks --
foo</p>

<p>When revision range specifiers are used to limit the
annotation, lines that have not changed since the range
boundary (either the commit v2.6.18 or the most recent
commit that is more than 3 weeks old in the above example)
are blamed for that range boundary commit.</p>

<p>A particularly useful way is to see if an added file has
lines created by copy-and-paste from existing files.
Sometimes this indicates that the developer was being sloppy
and did not refactor the code properly. You can first find
the commit that introduced the file with:</p>

<p>git log --diff-filter=A --pretty=short -- foo</p>

<p>and then annotate the change between the commit and its
parents, using commit^! notation:</p>

<p>git blame -C -C -f $commit^! -- foo</p>

<p>INCREMENTAL OUTPUT When called with --incremental
option, the command outputs the result as it is built. The
output generally will talk about lines touched by more
recent commits first (i.e. the lines will be annotated out
of order) and is meant to be used by interactive
viewers.</p>

<p>The output format is similar to the Porcelain format,
but it does not contain the actual lines from the file that
is being annotated.</p>

<p>1. Each blame entry always starts with a line of:</p>

<p>&lt;40-byte hex sha1&gt; &lt;sourceline&gt;
&lt;resultline&gt; &lt;num_lines&gt;</p>

<p>Line numbers count from 1.</p>

<p>2. The first time that a commit shows up in the stream,
it has various other information about it printed out with a
one-word tag at the beginning of each line describing the
extra commit information (author, email, committer, dates,
summary, etc.).</p>

<p>3. Unlike the Porcelain format, the filename information
is always given and terminates the entry:</p>

<p>&quot;filename&quot;
&lt;whitespace-quoted-filename-goes-here&gt;</p>

<p>and thus it is really quite easy to parse for some line-
and word-oriented parser (which should be quite natural for
most scripting languages).</p>

<p>Note For people who do parsing: to make it more robust,
just ignore any lines between the first and last one
(&quot;&lt;sha1&gt;&quot; and &quot;filename&quot; lines)
where you do not recognize the tag words (or care about that
particular one) at the beginning of the &quot;extended
information&quot; lines. That way, if there is ever added
information (like the commit encoding or extended commit
commentary), a blame viewer will not care.</p>

<p>MAPPING AUTHORS If the file .mailmap exists at the
toplevel of the repository, or at the location pointed to by
the mailmap.file configuration option, it is used to map
author and committer names and email addresses to canonical
real names and email addresses.</p>

<p>In the simple form, each line in the file consists of
the canonical real name of an author, whitespace, and an
email address used in the commit (enclosed by &lt; and &gt;)
to map to the name. For example:</p>

<p>Proper Name &lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p>The more complex forms are:</p>

<p>&lt;proper@email.xx&gt; &lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p>which allows mailmap to replace only the email part of a
commit, and:</p>

<p>Proper Name &lt;proper@email.xx&gt;
&lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p>which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the
email of a commit matching the specified commit email
address, and:</p>

<p>Proper Name &lt;proper@email.xx&gt; Commit Name
&lt;commit@email.xx&gt;</p>

<p>which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the
email of a commit matching both the specified commit name
and email address.</p>

<p>Example 1: Your history contains commits by two authors,
Jane and Joe, whose names appear in the repository under
several forms:</p>

<p>Joe Developer &lt;joe@example.com&gt; Joe R. Developer
&lt;joe@example.com&gt; Jane Doe &lt;jane@example.com&gt;
Jane Doe &lt;jane@laptop.(none)&gt; Jane D.
&lt;jane@desktop.(none)&gt;</p>

<p>Now suppose that Joe wants his middle name initial used,
and Jane prefers her family name fully spelled out. A proper
.mailmap file would look like:</p>

<p>Jane Doe &lt;jane@desktop.(none)&gt; Joe R. Developer
&lt;joe@example.com&gt;</p>

<p>Note how there is no need for an entry for
&lt;jane@laptop[1].(none)&gt;, because the real name of that
author is already correct.</p>

<p>Example 2: Your repository contains commits from the
following authors:</p>

<p>nick1 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt; nick2
&lt;bugs@company.xx&gt; nick2 &lt;nick2@company.xx&gt; santa
&lt;me@company.xx&gt; claus &lt;me@company.xx&gt; CTO
&lt;cto@coompany.xx&gt;</p>

<p>Then you might want a .mailmap file that looks like:</p>

<p>&lt;cto@company.xx&gt; &lt;cto@coompany.xx&gt; Some Dude
&lt;some@dude.xx&gt; nick1 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt; Other
Author &lt;other@author.xx&gt; nick2 &lt;bugs@company.xx&gt;
Other Author &lt;other@author.xx&gt;
&lt;nick2@company.xx&gt; Santa Claus
&lt;santa.claus@northpole.xx&gt; &lt;me@company.xx&gt;</p>

<p>Use hash # for comments that are either on their own
line, or after the email address.</p>
