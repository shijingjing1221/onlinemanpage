<p>NAME pmdalustrecomm - Lustre filesystem comms
performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/pmdalustrecomm [-d
domain] [-l logfile] [-U username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdalustrecomm is a Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics from
the Linux procfs filesystem about the state of various
aspects of the Lustre filesystem.</p>

<p>The lustrecomm PMDA exports metrics that focus on
distributed communi- cation in the filesystem, including
metrics related to timeouts, net- work drops, send/recv
information and route lengths. However, it also covers the
memory use of some of the Lustre filesystem components.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdalustrecomm command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named lus- trecomm.log is written in the current directory
of pmcd(1) when pmdalustrecomm is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the lus- trecomm performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdalustrecomm is launched by pmcd(1) and should never
be executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdalustrecomm $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/help default
help text file for the lustrecomm metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/Install installation script for
the pmdalustrecomm agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/Remove
undo installation script for the pmdalustrecomm agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lustrecomm.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdalustrecomm</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
