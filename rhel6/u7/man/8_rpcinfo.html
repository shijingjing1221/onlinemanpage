<p>RPCINFO(8) BSD System Manager s Manual RPCINFO(8)</p>

<p>NAME rpcinfo - report RPC information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpcinfo [-m | -s] [host] rpcinfo -p [host]
rpcinfo -T transport host prognum [versnum] rpcinfo -l [-T
transport] host prognum [versnum] rpcinfo [-n portnum] -u
host prognum [versnum] rpcinfo [-n portnum] [-t] host
prognum [versnum] rpcinfo -a serv_address -T transport
prognum [versnum] rpcinfo -b [-T transport] prognum versnum
rpcinfo -d [-T transport] prognum versnum</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server
and reports what it finds.</p>

<p>In the first synopsis, rpcinfo lists all the registered
RPC services with rpcbind on host. If host is not specified,
the local host is the default. If -s is used, the
information is displayed in a concise for- mat.</p>

<p>In the second synopsis, rpcinfo lists all the RPC
services registered with rpcbind, version 2. Also note that
the format of the information is different in the first and
the second synopsis. This is because the sec- ond synopsis
is an older protocol used to collect the information dis-
played (version 2 of the rpcbind protocol).</p>

<p>The third synopsis makes an RPC call to procedure 0 of
prognum and versnum on the specified host and reports
whether a response was received. transport is the transport
which has to be used for contacting the given service. The
remote address of the service is obtained by mak- ing a call
to the remote rpcbind.</p>

<p>The prognum argument is a number that represents an RPC
program number. If a versnum is specified, rpcinfo attempts
to call that version of the specified prognum. Otherwise,
rpcinfo attempts to find all the regis- tered version
numbers for the specified prognum by calling version 0,
which is presumed not to exist; if it does exist, rpcinfo
attempts to obtain this information by calling an extremely
high version number instead, and attempts to call each
registered version. Note: the version number is required for
-b and -d options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -T transport Specify the transport on which the
service is required. If this option is not specified,
rpcinfo uses the transport specified in the NETPATH
environment variable, or if that is unset or null, the
transport in the netconfig(5) database is used. This is a
generic option, and can be used in conjunction with other
options as shown in the SYNOPSIS.</p>

<p>-a serv_address Use serv_address as the (universal)
address for the service on transport to ping procedure 0 of
the specified prognum and report whether a response was
received. The -T option is required with the -a option.</p>

<p>If versnum is not specified, rpcinfo tries to ping all
available version numbers for that program number. This
option avoids calls to remote rpcbind to find the address of
the service. The serv_address is specified in universal
address format of the given transport.</p>

<p>-b Make an RPC broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified
prognum and versnum and report all hosts that respond. If
transport is spec- ified, it broadcasts its request only on
the specified transport. If broadcasting is not supported by
any transport, an error mes- sage is printed. Use of
broadcasting should be limited because of the potential for
adverse effect on other systems.</p>

<p>-d Delete registration for the RPC service of the
specified prognum and versnum. If transport is specified,
unregister the service on only that transport, otherwise
unregister the service on all the transports on which it was
registered. Only the owner of a service can delete a
registration, except the super-user who can delete any
service.</p>

<p>-l Display a list of entries with a given prognum and
versnum on the specified host. Entries are returned for all
transports in the same protocol family as that used to
contact the remote rpcbind.</p>

<p>-m Display a table of statistics of rpcbind operations
on the given host. The table shows statistics for each
version of rpcbind (versions 2, 3 and 4), giving the number
of times each procedure was requested and successfully
serviced, the number and type of remote call requests that
were made, and information about RPC address lookups that
were handled. This is useful for monitoring RPC activities
on host.</p>

<p>-n portnum Use portnum as the port number for the -t and
-u options instead of the port number given by rpcbind. Use
of this option avoids a call to the remote rpcbind to find
out the address of the ser- vice. This option is made
obsolete by the -a option.</p>

<p>-p Probe rpcbind on host using version 2 of the rpcbind
protocol, and display a list of all registered RPC programs.
If host is not specified, it defaults to the local host.
Note: Version 2 of the rpcbind protocol was previously known
as the portmapper pro- tocol.</p>

<p>-s Display a concise list of all registered RPC programs
on host. If host is not specified, it defaults to the local
host.</p>

<p>-t Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of prognum on the
specified host using TCP, and report whether a response was
received. This option is made obsolete by the -T option as
shown in the third synopsis.</p>

<p>-u Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of prognum on the
specified host using UDP, and report whether a response was
received. This option is made obsolete by the -T option as
shown in the third synopsis.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To show all of the RPC services registered on
the local machine use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo</p>

<p>To show all of the RPC services registered with rpcbind
on the machine named klaxon use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo klaxon</p>

<p>The information displayed by the above commands can be
quite lengthy. Use the -s option to display a more concise
list:</p>

<p>example$ rpcinfo -s klaxon</p>

<p>program version(s) netid(s) service owner 100000 2,3,4
local,tcp,udp,tcp6,udp6 rpcbind super-user 100008 1
udp,tcp,udp6,tcp6 walld super-user 100002 2,1 udp,udp6
rusersd super-user 100001 2,3,4 udp,udp6 rstatd super-user
100012 1 udp,tcp sprayd super-user 100007 3 udp,tcp ypbind
super-user</p>

<p>To show whether the RPC service with program number
prognum and version versnum is registered on the machine
named klaxon for the transport TCP use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo -T tcp klaxon prognum versnum</p>

<p>To show all RPC services registered with version 2 of
the rpcbind proto- col on the local machine use:</p>

<p>example% rpcinfo -p</p>

<p>To delete the registration for version 1 of the walld
(program number 100008 ) service for all transports use:</p>

<p>example# rpcinfo -d 100008 1</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>example# rpcinfo -d walld 1</p>
