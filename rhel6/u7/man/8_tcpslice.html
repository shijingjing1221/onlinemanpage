<p>NAME tcpslice - extract pieces of and/or merge together
tcpdump files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tcpslice [ -DdlRrt ] [ -w file ] [ start-time [
end-time ] ] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcpslice is a program for extracting
portions of packet-trace files generated using tcpdump(l)s
-w flag. It can also be used to merge together several such
files, as discussed below.</p>

<p>The basic operation of tcpslice is to copy to stdout all
packets from its input file(s) whose timestamps fall within
a given range. The starting and ending times of the range
may be specified on the command line. All ranges are
inclusive. The starting time defaults to the earliest time
of the first packet in any of the input files; we call this
the first time. The ending time defaults to ten years after
the starting time. Thus, the command tcpslice trace-file
simply copies trace-file to stdout (assuming the file does
not include more than ten years worth of data).</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to specify times. The first
is using Unix timestamps of the form sssssssss.uuuuuu (this
is the format specified by tcpdump s -tt flag). For example,
654321098.7654 specifies 38 sec- onds and 765,400
microseconds after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25, 1990.</p>

<p>All examples in this manual are given for PDT times, but
when display- ing times and interpreting times symbolically
as discussed below, tcp- slice uses the local timezone,
regardless of the timezone in which the tcpdump file was
generated. The daylight-savings setting used is that which
is appropriate for the local timezone at the date in
question. For example, times associated with summer months
will usually include daylight-savings effects, and those
with winter months will not.</p>

<p>Times may also be specified relative to either the first
time (when specifying a starting time) or the starting time
(when specifying an ending time) by preceding a numeric
value in seconds with a +. For example, a starting time of
+200 indicates 200 seconds after the first time, and the two
arguments +200 +300 indicate from 200 seconds after the
first time through 500 seconds after the first time.</p>

<p>Times may also be specified in terms of years (y),
months (m), days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s),
and microseconds(u). For example, the Unix timestamp
654321098.7654 discussed above could also be expressed as
1990y9m25d20h51m38s765400u. 2 or 4 digit years may be used;
2 digits can specify years from 1970 to 2069.</p>

<p>When specifying times using this style, fields that are
omitted default as follows. If the omitted field is a unit
greater than that of the first specified field, then its
value defaults to the corresponding value taken from either
first time (if the starting time is being spec- ified) or
the starting time (if the ending time is being specified).
If the omitted field is a unit less than that of the first
specified field, then it defaults to zero. For example,
suppose that the input file has a first time of the Unix
timestamp mentioned above, i.e., 38 seconds and 765,400
microseconds after 8:51PM PDT, Sept. 25, 1990. To specify
9:36PM PDT (exactly) on the same date we could use 21h36m.
To specify a range from 9:36PM PDT through 1:54AM PDT the
next day we could use 21h36m 26d1h54m.</p>

<p>Relative times can also be specified when using the
ymdhmsu format. Omitted fields then default to 0 if the unit
of the field is greater than that of the first specified
field, and to the corresponding value taken from either the
first time or the starting time if the omitted fields unit
is less than that of the first specified field. Given a
first time of the Unix timestamp mentioned above, 22h +1h10m
specifies a range from 10:00PM PDT on that date through
11:10PM PDT, and +1h +1h10m specifies a range from 38.7654
seconds after 9:51PM PDT through 38.7654 seconds after
11:01PM PDT. The first hour of the file could be extracted
using +0 +1h.</p>

<p>Note that with the ymdhmsu format there is an ambiguity
between using m for month or for minute. The ambiguity is
resolved as follows: if an m field is followed by a d field
then it is interpreted as specify- ing months; otherwise it
specifies minutes.</p>

<p>If more than one input file is specified then tcpslice
merges the pack- ets from the various input files into the
single output file. Nor- mally, this merge is done based on
the value of the timestamps in the packets in the individual
files. (Tcpslice assumes that within each input file,
packets are in timestamp order.) If the -l option is used,
the value used for ordering is the timestamp of a given
packet minus the timestamp of the first packet in the input
file in which the given packet occurs.</p>

<p>When merging files, by default tcpslice will discard any
duplicate packet it finds in more than one file. A duplicate
is a packet that has an identical timestamp (either relative
or absolute) and identical packet contents (for as much as
was captured) as another packet previ- ously seen in a
different file. Note that it is possible for the net- work
to generate true replicates of packets, and for systems that
can return the same timestamp for multiple packets, these
can be mistaken for duplicates and discarded. Accordingly,
tcpslice will not discard duplicates in the same trace file.
In addition, you can use the -D option to suppress any
discarding of duplicates.</p>

<p>A different issue arises if a file contains timestamps
that skip back- wards. tcpslice will include these in the
output, even if they precede the minimum time requested.
There should probably be an option to sup- press these.</p>

<p>Another problem relating to backwards timestamps is that
tcpslice uses random access to seek through a file looking
for packets corresponding to the desired range of time.
While doing so leads to a major perfor- mance benefit for
very large trace files, it also means that in the presence
of backwards timestamps tcpslice can fail to find the true
earliest occurrence of a packet matching the time interval
criteria. There should probably be an option to specify not
to use random access but just read the file linearly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS If any of -R, -r or -t are specified then
tcpslice reports the times- tamps of the first and last
packets in each input file and exits. Only one of these
three options may be specified.</p>

<p>-D Do not discard duplicate packets seen when merging
multiple trace files.</p>

<p>-d Dump the start and end times specified by the given
range and exit. This option is useful for checking that the
given range actually specifies the times you think it does.
If one of -R, -r or -t has been specified then the times are
dumped in the corresponding format; otherwise, raw format (
-R) is used.</p>

<p>-l When merging more than one file, merge on the basis
of relative time, rather than absolute time. Normally, when
merging files is done, packets are merged based on absolute
timestamps. With -l packets are merged based on the relative
time between the start of the file in which the packet is
found and the timestamp of the packet itself. The timestamp
of packets in the output file is calculated as the relative
time for the packet within its file plus first time.</p>

<p>-R Dump the timestamps of the first and last packets in
each input file as raw timestamps (i.e., in the form
sssssssss.uuuuuu).</p>

<p>-r Same as -R except the timestamps are dumped in
human-readable format, similar to that used by date(1).</p>

<p>-t Same as -R except the timestamps are dumped in
tcpslice format, i.e., in the ymdhmsu format discussed
above.</p>

<p>-w Direct the output to file rather than stdout.</p>

<p>BUGS Please send bug reports to tcpslice@ee.lbl.gov.</p>

<p>An input filename that beings with a digit or a + can be
confused with a start/end time. Such filenames can be
specified with a leading ./ ; for example, specify the file
04Jul76.trace as ./04Jul76.trace.</p>

<p>tcpslice cannot read its input from stdin, since it uses
random-access to rummage through its input files.</p>

<p>tcpslice refuses to write to its output if it is a
terminal (as indi- cated by isatty(3)). This is not a bug
but a feature, to prevent it from spraying binary data to
the user s terminal. Note that this means you must either
redirect stdout or specify an output file via -w.</p>

<p>tcpslice will not work properly on tcpdump files
spanning more than one year; with files containing portions
of packets whose original length was more than 65,535 bytes;
nor with files containing fewer than two packets. Such files
result in the error message: couldnt find final packet in
file . These problems are due to the interpolation scheme
used by tcpslice to greatly speed up its processing when
dealing with large trace files. Note that tcpslice can
efficiently extract slices from the middle of trace files of
any size, and can also work with truncated trace files
(i.e., the final packet in the file is only par- tially
present, typically due to tcpdump being ungracefully
killed).</p>

<p>Adding -l has broken some compatibility with older
versions, since tcp- slice now merges its input files,
rather than (approximately) concate- nating them together as
it did previously.</p>

<p>It would sometimes be convenient if you could specify a
clock offset to use with the -l option.</p>

<p>It would be nice if tcpslice supported more general
editing of trace files.</p>
