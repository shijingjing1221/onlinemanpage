<p>sane-teco1(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-teco1(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-teco1 - SANE backend for TECO / RELISYS
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-teco1 library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
some TECO SCSI flatbed scanners. This backend should be
considered beta-quality software! TECO scanners are sold
under various brands like RELISYS, PIOTECH, TRUST. This
backend may or may not support yours.</p>

<p>The scanners that should work with this backend are:</p>

<p>Vendor Model TECO model status ----------------------

VM6530+ untested</p>

<p>Note that the untested scanner will not be directly
supported. You should contact the author for that.</p>

<p>The TECO VM number can usually be found at the back of
the scanner. It is also part of the FCC ID.
&quot;sane-find-scanner -v&quot; will also show the scsi
inquiry, and if it is a TECO scanner, the name will be there
too.</p>

<p>The options the backend supports can either be selected
through command line options to programs like scanimage or
through GUI elements in xscanimage or xsane.</p>

<p>If you have any success with a scanner not listed here,
or if you have any strange behavior, please report to the
backend maintainer or to the SANE mailing list.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d teco1</p>

<p>Scan Mode</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
scanner valid choices are Black &amp; White , Grayscale and
Color The Black &amp; White mode is black and white only (1
bit). Grayscale will produce 256 lev- els of gray (8 bits).
Color will produce a 24 bits color image.</p>

<p>--resolution selects the resolution for a scan. The
scanner can do all reso- lutions between 1 and 600, in
increments of 1.</p>

<p>Geometry options</p>

<p>-l -t -x -y control the scan area: -l sets the top left
x coordinate, -t the top left y coordinate, -x selects the
width and -y the height of the scan area. All parameters are
specified in millimeters by default.</p>

<p>Enhancement options</p>

<p>--custom-gamma (color mode only) allows the user to
specify a gamma table (see the next 3 parameters).</p>

<p>--red-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the red channel. The
table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--green-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the green channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--blue-gamma-table (color mode only) can be used to
download a user defined gamma table for the blue channel.
The table must be 256 bytes long.</p>

<p>--dither (Black &amp; White only) select the dither mask
to use. Possible values are Line art , 2x2 , 3x3 , 4x4 bayer
, 4x4 smooth , 8x8 bayer , 8x8 smooth , 8x8 horizontal and
8x8 vertical</p>

<p>--preview requests a preview scan. The resolution used
for that scan is 22 dpi and the scan area is the maximum
allowed. The scan mode is user selected. The default is
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/teco1.conf supports only one infor- mation: the
device name to use (eg /dev/scanner).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-teco1.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-teco1.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_TECO1 If the library was compiled
with debug support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of
128 requests all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The windows TWAIN driver has many more
options than this SANE backend. However they are only
software adjustments. This backend only imple- ments what
the scanner can support.</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>
