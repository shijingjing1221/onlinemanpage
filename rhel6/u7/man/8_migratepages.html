<p>NAME migratepages - Migrate the physical location a
processes pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS migratepages pid from-nodes to-nodes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION migratepages moves the physical location of
a processes pages without any changes of the virtual address
space of the process. Moving the pages allows one to change
the distances of a process to its memory. Performance may be
optimized by moving a processes pages to the node where it
is executing.</p>

<p>If multiple nodes are specified for from-nodes or
to-nodes then an attempt is made to preserve the relative
location of each page in each nodeset.</p>

<p>For example if we move from nodes 2-5 to 7,9,12-13 then
the preferred mode of operation is to move pages from
2-&gt;7, 3-&gt;9, 4-&gt;12 and 5-&gt;13. However, this is
only posssible if enough memory is available.</p>

<p>Valid node specifiers</p>

<p>all All nodes number Node number number1{,number2} Node
number1 and Node number2 number1-number2 Nodes from number1
to number2 ! nodes Invert selection of the following
specification.</p>

<p>NOTES Requires an NUMA policy aware kernel with support
for page migration (linux 2.6.16 and later).</p>

<p>migratepages will only move pages that are not shared
with other pro- cesses if called by a user without
administrative priviledges (but with the right to modify the
process).</p>

<p>migratepages will move all pages if invoked from root
(or a user with administrative priviledges).</p>

<p>FILES /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/numa_maps for information about
the NUMA memory use of a process.</p>
