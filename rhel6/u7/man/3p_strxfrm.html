<p>STRXFRM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRXFRM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strxfrm - string transformation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t strxfrm(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict
s2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strxfrm() function shall transform the
string pointed to by s2 and place the resulting string into
the array pointed to by s1. The trans- formation is such
that if strcmp() is applied to two transformed strings, it
shall return a value greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
corresponding to the result of strcoll() applied to the same
two original strings. No more than n bytes are placed into
the resulting array pointed to by s1, including the
terminating null byte. If n is 0, s1 is permitted to be a
null pointer. If copying takes place between objects that
overlap, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The strxfrm() function shall not change the setting of
errno if suc- cessful.</p>

<p>Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error,
an application wishing to check for error situations should
set errno to 0, then call strxfrm(), then check errno.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, strxfrm() shall
return the length of the transformed string (not including
the terminating null byte). If the value returned is n or
more, the contents of the array pointed to by s1 are
unspecified.</p>

<p>On error, strxfrm() may set errno but no return value is
reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The strxfrm() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The string pointed to by the s2 argument contains
characters outside the domain of the collating sequence.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The transformation function is such
that two transformed strings can be ordered by strcmp() as
appropriate to collating sequence information in the
programs locale (category LC_COLLATE ).</p>

<p>The fact that when n is 0 s1 is permitted to be a null
pointer is use- ful to determine the size of the s1 array
prior to making the transfor- mation.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
