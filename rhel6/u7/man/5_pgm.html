Specification(5)</p>

<p>NAME pgm - Netpbm grayscale image format</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>The PGM format is a lowest common denominator grayscale
file format. It is designed to be extremely easy to learn
and write programs for. (Its so simple that most people will
simply reverse engineer it because its easier than reading
this specification).</p>

<p>A PGM image represents a grayscale graphic image. There
are many psueudo-PGM formats in use where everything is as
specified herein except for the meaning of individual pixel
values. For most purposes, a PGM image can just be thought
of an array of arbitrary integers, and all the programs in
the world that think theyre processing a grayscale image can
easily be tricked into processing something else.</p>

<p>The name &quot;PGM&quot; is an acronym derived from
&quot;Portable Gray Map.&quot;</p>

<p>One official variant of PGM is the transparency mask. A
transparency mask in Netpbm is represented by a PGM image,
except that in place of pixel intensities, there are
opaqueness values. See below.</p>

<p>The format definition is as follows. You can use the
libnetpbm(1)Csub- routinelibrarytoconveniently and
accurately read and interpret the for- mat.</p>

<p>A PGM file consists of a sequence of one or more PGM
images. There are no data, delimiters, or padding before,
after, or between images.</p>

<p>Each PGM image consists of the following:</p>

<p>&middot; A magic number for identifying the file type. A
pgm images magic number is the two characters P5.</p>

<p>&middot; Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).</p>

<p>&middot; A width, formatted as ASCII characters in
decimal.</p>

<p>&middot; Whitespace.</p>

<p>&middot; A height, again in ASCII decimal.</p>

<p>&middot; Whitespace.</p>

<p>&middot; The maximum gray value (Maxval), again in ASCII
decimal. Must be less than 65536, and more than zero.</p>

<p>&middot; A single whitespace character (usually a
newline).</p>

<p>&middot; A raster of Height rows, in order from top to
bottom. Each row consists of Width gray values, in order
from left to right. Each gray value is a number from 0
through Maxval, with 0 being black and Maxval being white.
Each gray value is represented in pure binary by either 1 or
2 bytes. If the Maxval is less than 256, it is 1 byte.
Otherwise, it is 2 bytes. The most signifi- cant byte is
first.</p>

<p>A row of an image is horizontal. A column is vertical.
The pixels in the image are square and contiguous.</p>

<p>Each gray value is a number proportional to the
intensity of the pixel, adjusted by the ITU-R Recommendation
BT.709 gamma trans- fer function. (That transfer function
specifies a gamma number of 2.2 and has a linear section for
small intensities). A value of zero is therefore black. A
value of Maxval represents CIE D65 white and the most
intense value in the image and any other image to which the
image might be compared.</p>

<p>Note that a common variation on the PGM format is to
have the gray value be linear, i.e. as specified above
except without the gamma adjustment. pnmgamma takes such a
PGM variant as input and produces a true PGM as output.</p>

<p>In the transparency mask variation on PGM, the value
represents opaqueness. It is proportional to the fraction of
intensity of a pixel that would show in place of an
underlying pixel. So what normally means white represents
total opaqueness and what normally means black represents
total transparency. In between, you would compute the
intensity of a composite pixel of an under and over pixel as
under * (1-(alpha/alpha_maxval)) + over *
(alpha/alpha_maxval). Note that there is no gamma trans- fer
function in the transparency mask.</p>

<p>Strings starting with # may be comments, the same as
with PBM(1).</p>

<p>Note that you can use pamdepth to convert between a the
format with 1 byte per gray value and the one with 2 bytes
per gray value.</p>

<p>There is actually another version of the PGM format that
is fairly rare: plain PGM format. The format above, which
generally considered the normal one, is known as the raw PGM
format. See pbm(1)for- somecommentaryonhowplain and raw
formats relate to one another and how to use them.</p>

<p>The difference in the plain format is:</p>

<p>- There is exactly one image in a file.</p>

<p>- The magic number is P2 instead of P5.</p>

<p>- Each pixel in the raster is represented as an ASCII
decimal num- ber (of arbitrary size).</p>

<p>- Each pixel in the raster has white space before and
after it. There must be at least one character of white
space between any two pixels, but there is no maximum.</p>

<p>- No line should be longer than 70 characters.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a small image in the plain PGM
format. P2 # feep.pgm 24 7 15 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 11 11 11 11 0 0
15 15 15 15 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 0 0 0 0 15 0 0
15 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 11 11 11 0 0 0 15 15 15 15 0
0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 11 0 0 0 0 0 15 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 11 11 11 11 0 0 15 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</p>

<p>There is a newline character at the end of each of these
lines.</p>

<p>Programs that read this format should be as lenient as
possible, accepting anything that looks remotely like a
PGM.</p>

<p>All characters referred to herein are encoded in ASCII.
newline refers the the character known in ASCII as Line Feed
or LF. A white space character is space, CR, LF, TAB, VT, or
FF (I.e. what the ANSI standard C isspace() function calls
white space).</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY Before April 2000, a raw format PGM file
could not have a maxval greater than 255. Hence, it could
not have more than one byte per sam- ple. Old programs may
depend on this.</p>

<p>Before July 2000, there could be at most one image in a
PGM file. As a result, most tools to process PGM files
ignore (and dont read) any data after the first image.</p>
