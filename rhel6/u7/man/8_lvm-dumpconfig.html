<p>NAME lvm-dumpconfig dump LVM configuration</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvm dumpconfig [-f|--file filename] [--type

ing|new|profilable|profilable-command|profilable-metadata}
[--atversion version] [--ignoreadvanced]
[--ignoreunsupported] [--config Configura- tionString]
[--commandprofile ProfileName] [--profile ProfileName]
[--metadataprofile ProfileName] [--mergedconfig]
[--validate] [--with- comments] [--withversions]
[ConfigurationNode...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvm dumpconfig produces formatted output
with LVM configuration tree.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f, --file filename Dump configuration to a file
named filename.</p>

<p>--type {current|default|diff|missing|new|profilable}
Select the type of configuration to dump. The configuration
set- tings dumped have either default values or currently
used values assigned based on the type selected (if no type
is selected, --type current is used by default). Whenever a
configuration setting with a default value is commented out,
it means the set- ting does not have any concrete default
value defined. All out- put can be saved and reused as
proper lvm.conf(5) file.</p>

<p>current Dump current lvm.conf configuration merged with
any tag con- fig if used. See also lvm.conf(5) for more info
about LVM configuration methods.</p>

<p>default Dump all possible configuration settings with
default values assigned.</p>

<p>diff Dump all configuration settings for which the
values used differ from defaults. The value assigned for
each configura- tion setting is the value currently used.
This is actually minimal LVM configuration which can be used
without a change to current configured behaviour.</p>

<p>missing Dump all configuration settings with default
values assigned which are missing in the configuration
currently used and for which LVM automatically fallbacks to
using these default val- ues.</p>

<p>new Dump all new configuration settings introduced in
current LVM version or specific version as defined by
--atversion option.</p>

<p>profilable Dump all profilable configuration settings
with default val- ues assigned. See lvm.conf(5) for more
info about profile config method.</p>

<p>profilable-command Dump all profilable configuration
settings with default val- ues assigned that can be used in
command profile. This is a subset of settings dumped by
--type --profilable.</p>

<p>profilable-metadata Dump all profilable configuration
settings with default val- ues assigned that can be used in
metadata profile. This is a subset of settings dumped by
--type --profilable.</p>

<p>--atversion version Specify an LVM version in x.y.z
format where x is the major ver- sion, the y is the minor
version and z is the patchlevel (e.g. 2.2.106). When
configuration is dumped, the configuration set- tings
recognized at this LVM version will be considered only. This
can be used to dump a configuration that certain LVM ver-
sion understands and which does not contain any newer
settings for which LVM would issue a warning message when
checking the configuration.</p>

<p>--ignoreadvanced Ignore advanced configuration settings
on dump.</p>

<p>--ignoreunsupported Ignore unsupported configuration
settings on dump. These set- tings are either used for
debugging purposes only or their sup- port is not yet
complete and they are not meant to be used in
production.</p>

<p>--config ConfigurationString Use ConfigurationString to
override existing configuration. This configuration is then
applied for dumpconfig command itself. See also lvm.conf(5)
for more info about config cas- cade.</p>

<p>--commandprofile ProfileName Use ProfileName to override
existing configuration. This con- figuration is then applied
for dumpconfig command itself. See also --mergedconfig
option and lvm.conf(5) for more info about config
cascade.</p>

<p>--profile ProfileName The same as using --commandprofile
but the configuration is not applied for dumpconfig command
itself.</p>

<p>--metadataprofile ProfileName Use ProfileName to
override existing configuration. The config- uration defined
in metadata profile has no effect for dumpconfig command
itself, the dumpconfig dumps the configuration only. See
also --mergedconfig option and lvm.conf(5) for more info
about config cascade.</p>

<p>--mergedconfig When the dumpconfig command is run with
the --config option and/or --commandprofile (or using
LVM_COMMAND_PROFILE environ- ment variable), --profile,
--metadataprofile option, merge all the contents of the
config cascade before dumping it. Without the --mergeconfig
option used, only the configuration at the front of the
cascade is dumped. See also lvm.conf(5) for more info about
config cascade.</p>

<p>--validate Validate current configuration used and exit
with appropriate return code. The validation is done only
for the configuration at the front of the config cascade. To
validate the whole merged configuration tree, use also the
--mergedconfig option. The validation is done even if
config/checks lvm.conf(5) option is disabled.</p>

<p>--withcomments Also dump comments for each configuration
node.</p>

<p>--withversions Also dump a comment containing the
version of introduction for each configuration node.</p>
