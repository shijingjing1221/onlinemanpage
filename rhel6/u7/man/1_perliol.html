<p>NAME perliol - C API for Perls implementation of IO in
Layers.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /* Defining a layer ... */ #include
&lt;perliol.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes the behavior and
implementation of the PerlIO abstraction described in
perlapio when &quot;USE_PERLIO&quot; is defined (and
&quot;USE_SFIO&quot; is not).</p>

<p>History and Background The PerlIO abstraction was
introduced in perl5.003_02 but languished as just an
abstraction until perl5.7.0. However during that time a
number of perl extensions switched to using it, so the API
is mostly fixed to maintain (source) compatibility.</p>

<p>The aim of the implementation is to provide the PerlIO
API in a flexible and platform neutral manner. It is also a
trial of an &quot;Object Oriented C, with vtables&quot;
approach which may be applied to Perl 6.</p>

<p>Basic Structure PerlIO is a stack of layers.</p>

<p>The low levels of the stack work with the low-level
operating system calls (file descriptors in C) getting bytes
in and out, the higher layers of the stack buffer, filter,
and otherwise manipulate the I/O, and return characters (or
bytes) to Perl. Terms above and below are used to refer to
the relative positioning of the stack layers.</p>

<p>A layer contains a &quot;vtable&quot;, the table of I/O
operations (at C level a table of function pointers), and
status flags. The functions in the vtable implement
operations like &quot;open&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, and
&quot;write&quot;.</p>

<p>When I/O, for example &quot;read&quot;, is requested,
the request goes from Perl first down the stack using
&quot;read&quot; functions of each layer, then at the bottom
the input is requested from the operating system services,
then the result is returned up the stack, finally being
interpreted as Perl data.</p>

<p>The requests do not necessarily go always all the way
down to the operating system: thats where PerlIO buffering
comes into play.</p>

<p>When you do an open() and specify extra PerlIO layers to
be deployed, the layers you specify are &quot;pushed&quot;
on top of the already existing default stack. One way to see
it is that &quot;operating system is on the left&quot; and
&quot;Perl is on the right&quot;.</p>

<p>What exact layers are in this default stack depends on a
lot of things: your operating system, Perl version, Perl
compile time configuration, and Perl runtime configuration.
See PerlIO, &quot;PERLIO&quot; in perlrun, and open for more
information.</p>

<p>binmode() operates similarly to open(): by default the
specified layers are pushed on top of the existing
stack.</p>

<p>However, note that even as the specified layers are
&quot;pushed on top&quot; for open() and binmode(), this
doesnt mean that the effects are limited to the
&quot;top&quot;: PerlIO layers can be very active and
inspect and affect layers also deeper in the stack. As an
example there is a layer called &quot;raw&quot; which
repeatedly &quot;pops&quot; layers until it reaches the
first layer that has declared itself capable of handling
binary data. The &quot;pushed&quot; layers are processed in
left-to-right order.</p>

<p>sysopen() operates (unsurprisingly) at a lower level in
the stack than open(). For example in UNIX or UNIX-like
systems sysopen() operates directly at the level of file
descriptors: in the terms of PerlIO layers, it uses only the
&quot;unix&quot; layer, which is a rather thin wrapper on
top of the UNIX file descriptors.</p>

<p>Layers vs Disciplines Initial discussion of the ability
to modify IO streams behaviour used the term
&quot;discipline&quot; for the entities which were added.
This came (I believe) from the use of the term in
&quot;sfio&quot;, which in turn borrowed it from &quot;line
disciplines&quot; on Unix terminals. However, this document
(and the C code) uses the term &quot;layer&quot;.</p>

<p>This is, I hope, a natural term given the
implementation, and should avoid connotations that are
inherent in earlier uses of &quot;discipline&quot; for
things which are rather different.</p>

<p>Data Structures The basic data structure is a
PerlIOl:</p>

<p>typedef struct _PerlIO PerlIOl; typedef struct
_PerlIO_funcs PerlIO_funcs; typedef PerlIOl *PerlIO;</p>

<p>struct _PerlIO { PerlIOl * next; /* Lower layer */
PerlIO_funcs * tab; /* Functions for this layer */ IV flags;
/* Various flags for state */ };</p>

<p>A &quot;PerlIOl *&quot; is a pointer to the struct, and
the application level &quot;PerlIO *&quot; is a pointer to a
&quot;PerlIOl *&quot; - i.e. a pointer to a pointer to the
struct. This allows the application level &quot;PerlIO
*&quot; to remain constant while the actual &quot;PerlIOl
*&quot; underneath changes. (Compare perls &quot;SV *&quot;
which remains constant while its &quot;sv_any&quot; field
changes as the scalar s type changes.) An IO stream is then
in general represented as a pointer to this linked-list of
&quot;layers&quot;.</p>

<p>It should be noted that because of the double
indirection in a &quot;PerlIO *&quot;, a
&quot;&amp;(perlio-&gt;next)&quot; &quot;is&quot; a
&quot;PerlIO *&quot;, and so to some degree at least one
layer can use the &quot;standard&quot; API on the next layer
down.</p>

<p>A &quot;layer&quot; is composed of two parts:</p>

<p>1. The functions and attributes of the &quot;layer
class&quot;.</p>

<p>2. The per-instance data for a particular handle.</p>

<p>Functions and Attributes The functions and attributes
are accessed via the &quot;tab&quot; (for table) member of
&quot;PerlIOl&quot;. The functions (methods of the layer
&quot;class&quot;) are fixed, and are defined by the
&quot;PerlIO_funcs&quot; type. They are broadly the same as
the public &quot;PerlIO_xxxxx&quot; functions:</p>

<p>struct _PerlIO_funcs { Size_t fsize; char * name; Size_t
size; IV kind; IV (*Pushed)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,const char
*mode,SV *arg, PerlIO_funcs *tab); IV (*Popped)(pTHX_ PerlIO
*f); PerlIO * (*Open)(pTHX_ PerlIO_funcs *tab, PerlIO_list_t
*layers, IV n, const char *mode, int fd, int imode, int
perm, PerlIO *old, int narg, SV **args); IV (*Binmode)(pTHX_
PerlIO *f); SV * (*Getarg)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, CLONE_PARAMS
*param, int flags) IV (*Fileno)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); PerlIO *
(*Dup)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, PerlIO *o, CLONE_PARAMS *param, int
flags) /* Unix-like functions - cf sfio line disciplines */
SSize_t (*Read)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, void *vbuf, Size_t count);
SSize_t (*Unread)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, const void *vbuf, Size_t
count); SSize_t (*Write)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, const void *vbuf,
Size_t count); IV (*Seek)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, Off_t offset, int
whence); Off_t (*Tell)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); IV (*Close)(pTHX_
PerlIO *f); /* Stdio-like buffered IO functions */ IV
(*Flush)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); IV (*Fill)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); IV
(*Eof)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); IV (*Error)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); void
(*Clearerr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); void (*Setlinebuf)(pTHX_
PerlIO *f); /* Perl&rsquo;s snooping functions */ STDCHAR *
(*Get_base)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); Size_t (*Get_bufsiz)(pTHX_
PerlIO *f); STDCHAR * (*Get_ptr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); SSize_t
(*Get_cnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f); void (*Set_ptrcnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO
*f,STDCHAR *ptr,SSize_t cnt); };</p>

<p>The first few members of the struct give a function
table size for compatibility check &quot;name&quot; for the
layer, the size to &quot;malloc&quot; for the per-instance
data, and some flags which are attributes of the class as
whole (such as whether it is a buffering layer), then follow
the functions which fall into four basic groups:</p>

<p>1. Opening and setup functions</p>

<p>2. Basic IO operations</p>

<p>3. Stdio class buffering options.</p>

<p>4. Functions to support Perls traditional
&quot;fast&quot; access to the buffer.</p>

<p>A layer does not have to implement all the functions,
but the whole table has to be present. Unimplemented slots
can be NULL (which will result in an error when called) or
can be filled in with stubs to &quot;inherit&quot; behaviour
from a &quot;base class&quot;. This &quot;inheritance&quot;
is fixed for all instances of the layer, but as the layer
chooses which stubs to populate the table, limited
&quot;multiple inheritance&quot; is possible.</p>

<p>Per-instance Data The per-instance data are held in
memory beyond the basic PerlIOl struct, by making a PerlIOl
the first member of the layers struct thus:</p>

<p>typedef struct { struct _PerlIO base; /* Base
&quot;class&quot; info */ STDCHAR * buf; /* Start of buffer
*/ STDCHAR * end; /* End of valid part of buffer */ STDCHAR
* ptr; /* Current position in buffer */ Off_t posn; /*
Offset of buf into the file */ Size_t bufsiz; /* Real size
of buffer */ IV oneword; /* Emergency buffer */ }
PerlIOBuf;</p>

<p>In this way (as for perl s scalars) a pointer to a
PerlIOBuf can be treated as a pointer to a PerlIOl.</p>

<p>Layers in action. table perlio unix | | +-----------+
+----------+ +--------+ PerlIO -&gt;| |---&gt;| next
|---&gt;| NULL | +-----------+ +----------+ +--------+ | | |
buffer | | fd | +-----------+ | | +--------+ | |
+----------+</p>

<p>The above attempts to show how the layer scheme works in
a simple case. The applications &quot;PerlIO *&quot; points
to an entry in the table(s) representing open (allocated)
handles. For example the first three slots in the table
correspond to &quot;stdin&quot;,&quot;stdout&quot; and
&quot;stderr&quot;. The table in turn points to the current
&quot;top&quot; layer for the handle - in this case an
instance of the generic buffering layer &quot;perlio&quot;.
That layer in turn points to the next layer down - in this
case the low- level &quot;unix&quot; layer.</p>

<p>The above is roughly equivalent to a &quot;stdio&quot;
buffered stream, but with much more flexibility:</p>

<p>&middot; If Unix level
&quot;read&quot;/&quot;write&quot;/&quot;lseek&quot; is not
appropriate for (say) sockets then the &quot;unix&quot;
layer can be replaced (at open time or even dynamically)
with a &quot;socket&quot; layer.</p>

<p>&middot; Different handles can have different buffering
schemes. The &quot;top&quot; layer could be the
&quot;mmap&quot; layer if reading disk files was quicker
using &quot;mmap&quot; than &quot;read&quot;. An
&quot;unbuffered&quot; stream can be implemented simply by
not having a buffer layer.</p>

<p>&middot; Extra layers can be inserted to process the
data as it flows through. This was the driving need for
including the scheme in perl 5.7.0+ - we needed a mechanism
to allow data to be translated between perls internal
encoding (conceptually at least Unicode as UTF-8), and the
&quot;native&quot; format used by the system. This is
provided by the &quot;:encoding(xxxx)&quot; layer which
typically sits above the buffering layer.</p>

<p>&middot; A layer can be added that does &quot;0 to CRLF
translation. This layer can be used on any platform, not
just those that normally do such things.</p>

<p>Per-instance flag bits The generic flag bits are a
hybrid of &quot;O_XXXXX&quot; style flags deduced from the
mode string passed to &quot;PerlIO_open()&quot;, and state
bits for typical buffer layers.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_EOF End of file.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_CANWRITE Writes are permitted, i.e. opened as
&quot;w&quot; or &quot;r+&quot; or &quot;a&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_CANREAD Reads are permitted i.e. opened
&quot;r&quot; or &quot;w+&quot; (or even &quot;a+&quot; -
ick).</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_ERROR An error has occurred (for
&quot;PerlIO_error()&quot;).</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_TRUNCATE Truncate file suggested by open
mode.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_APPEND All writes should be appends.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_CRLF Layer is performing Win32-like &quot;0
mapped to CR,LF for output and CR,LF mapped to &quot;0 for
input. Normally the provided &quot;crlf&quot; layer is the
only layer that need bother about this.
&quot;PerlIO_binmode()&quot; will mess with this flag rather
than add/remove layers if the &quot;PERLIO_K_CANCRLF&quot;
bit is set for the layers class.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_UTF8 Data written to this layer should be UTF-8
encoded; data provided by this layer should be considered
UTF-8 encoded. Can be set on any layer by &quot;:utf8&quot;
dummy layer. Also set on &quot;:encoding&quot; layer.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_UNBUF Layer is unbuffered - i.e. write to next
layer down should occur for each write to this layer.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_WRBUF The buffer for this layer currently holds
data written to it but not sent to next layer.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_RDBUF The buffer for this layer currently holds
unconsumed data read from layer below.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_LINEBUF Layer is line buffered. Write data
should be passed to next layer down whenever a &quot;0 is
seen. Any data beyond the &quot;0 should then be
processed.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_TEMP File has been &quot;unlink()&quot;ed, or
should be deleted on &quot;close()&quot;.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_OPEN Handle is open.</p>

<p>PERLIO_F_FASTGETS This instance of this layer supports
the &quot;fast &quot;gets&quot;&quot; interface. Normally
set based on &quot;PERLIO_K_FASTGETS&quot; for the class and
by the existence of the function(s) in the table. However a
class that normally provides that interface may need to
avoid it on a particular instance. The &quot;pending&quot;
layer needs to do this when it is pushed above a layer which
does not support the interface. (Perl s
&quot;sv_gets()&quot; does not expect the streams fast
&quot;gets&quot; behaviour to change during one
&quot;get&quot;.)</p>

<p>Methods in Detail fsize Size_t fsize;</p>

<p>Size of the function table. This is compared against the
value PerlIO code &quot;knows&quot; as a compatibility
check. Future versions may be able to tolerate layers
compiled against an old version of the headers.</p>

<p>name char * name;</p>

<p>The name of the layer whose open() method Perl should
invoke on open(). For example if the layer is called APR,
you will call:</p>

<p>open $fh, &quot;&gt;:APR&quot;, ...</p>

<p>and Perl knows that it has to invoke the
PerlIOAPR_open() method implemented by the APR layer.</p>

<p>size Size_t size;</p>

<p>The size of the per-instance data structure, e.g.:</p>

<p>sizeof(PerlIOAPR)</p>

<p>If this field is zero then &quot;PerlIO_pushed&quot;
does not malloc anything and assumes layer s Pushed function
will do any required layer stack manipulation - used to
avoid malloc/free overhead for dummy layers. If the field is
non-zero it must be at least the size of
&quot;PerlIOl&quot;, &quot;PerlIO_pushed&quot; will allocate
memory for the layers data structures and link new layer
onto the streams stack. (If the layers Pushed method returns
an error indication the layer is popped again.)</p>

<p>kind IV kind;</p>

<p>&middot; PERLIO_K_BUFFERED</p>

<p>The layer is buffered.</p>

<p>&middot; PERLIO_K_RAW</p>

<p>The layer is acceptable to have in a binmode(FH) stack -
i.e. it does not (or will configure itself not to) transform
bytes passing through it.</p>

<p>&middot; PERLIO_K_CANCRLF</p>

<p>Layer can translate between &quot;0 and CRLF line
ends.</p>

<p>&middot; PERLIO_K_FASTGETS</p>

<p>Layer allows buffer snooping.</p>

<p>&middot; PERLIO_K_MULTIARG</p>

<p>Used when the layers open() accepts more arguments than
usual. The extra arguments should come not before the
&quot;MODE&quot; argument. When this flag is used its up to
the layer to validate the args.</p>

<p>Pushed IV (*Pushed)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f,const char *mode, SV
*arg);</p>

<p>The only absolutely mandatory method. Called when the
layer is pushed onto the stack. The &quot;mode&quot;
argument may be NULL if this occurs post-open. The
&quot;arg&quot; will be non-&quot;NULL&quot; if an argument
string was passed. In most cases this should call
&quot;PerlIOBase_pushed()&quot; to convert &quot;mode&quot;
into the appropriate &quot;PERLIO_F_XXXXX&quot; flags in
addition to any actions the layer itself takes. If a layer
is not expecting an argument it need neither save the one
passed to it, nor provide &quot;Getarg()&quot; (it could
perhaps &quot;Perl_warn&quot; that the argument was
un-expected).</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success. On failure returns -1 and should
set errno.</p>

<p>Popped IV (*Popped)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Called when the layer is popped from the stack. A layer
will normally be popped after &quot;Close()&quot; is called.
But a layer can be popped without being closed if the
program is dynamically managing layers on the stream. In
such cases &quot;Popped()&quot; should free any resources
(buffers, translation tables, ...) not held directly in the
layer s struct. It should also &quot;Unread()&quot; any
unconsumed data that has been read and buffered from the
layer below back to that layer, so that it can be
re-provided to what ever is now above.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success and failure. If
&quot;Popped()&quot; returns true then perlio.c assumes that
either the layer has popped itself, or the layer is super
special and needs to be retained for other reasons. In most
cases it should return false.</p>

<p>Open PerlIO * (*Open)(...);</p>

<p>The &quot;Open()&quot; method has lots of arguments
because it combines the functions of perl s
&quot;open&quot;, &quot;PerlIO_open&quot;, perl s
&quot;sysopen&quot;, &quot;PerlIO_fdopen&quot; and
&quot;PerlIO_reopen&quot;. The full prototype is as
follows:</p>

<p>PerlIO * (*Open)(pTHX_ PerlIO_funcs *tab, PerlIO_list_t
*layers, IV n, const char *mode, int fd, int imode, int
perm, PerlIO *old, int narg, SV **args);</p>

<p>Open should (perhaps indirectly) call
&quot;PerlIO_allocate()&quot; to allocate a slot in the
table and associate it with the layers information for the
opened file, by calling &quot;PerlIO_push&quot;. The layers
is an array of all the layers destined for the &quot;PerlIO
*&quot;, and any arguments passed to them, n is the index
into that array of the layer being called. The macro
&quot;PerlIOArg&quot; will return a (possibly
&quot;NULL&quot;) SV * for the argument passed to the
layer.</p>

<p>The mode string is an
&quot;&quot;fopen()&quot;-like&quot; string which would
match the regular expression
&quot;/^[I#]?[rwa]+?[bt]?$/&quot;.</p>

<p>The &rsquo;I&rsquo; prefix is used during creation of
&quot;stdin&quot;..&quot;stderr&quot; via special
&quot;PerlIO_fdopen&quot; calls; the &rsquo;#&rsquo; prefix
means that this is &quot;sysopen&quot; and that imode and
perm should be passed to &quot;PerlLIO_open3&quot;;
&rsquo;r&rsquo; means read, &rsquo;w&rsquo; means write and
&rsquo;a&rsquo; means append. The &rsquo;+&rsquo; suffix
means that both reading and writing/appending are permitted.
The &rsquo;b&rsquo; suffix means file should be binary, and
&rsquo;t&rsquo; means it is text. (Almost all layers should
do the IO in binary mode, and ignore the b/t bits. The
&quot;:crlf&quot; layer should be pushed to handle the
distinction.)</p>

<p>If old is not &quot;NULL&quot; then this is a
&quot;PerlIO_reopen&quot;. Perl itself does not use this
(yet?) and semantics are a little vague.</p>

<p>If fd not negative then it is the numeric file
descriptor fd, which will be open in a manner compatible
with the supplied mode string, the call is thus equivalent
to &quot;PerlIO_fdopen&quot;. In this case nargs will be
zero.</p>

<p>If nargs is greater than zero then it gives the number
of arguments passed to &quot;open&quot;, otherwise it will
be 1 if for example &quot;PerlIO_open&quot; was called. In
simple cases SvPV_nolen(*args) is the pathname to open.</p>

<p>Having said all that translation-only layers do not need
to provide &quot;Open()&quot; at all, but rather leave the
opening to a lower level layer and wait to be
&quot;pushed&quot;. If a layer does provide
&quot;Open()&quot; it should normally call the
&quot;Open()&quot; method of next layer down (if any) and
then push itself on top if that succeeds.</p>

<p>If &quot;PerlIO_push&quot; was performed and open has
failed, it must &quot;PerlIO_pop&quot; itself, since if its
not, the layer wont be removed and may cause bad
problems.</p>

<p>Returns &quot;NULL&quot; on failure.</p>

<p>Binmode IV (*Binmode)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Optional. Used when &quot;:raw&quot; layer is pushed
(explicitly or as a result of binmode(FH)). If not present
layer will be popped. If present should configure layer as
binary (or pop itself) and return 0. If it returns -1 for
error &quot;binmode&quot; will fail with layer still on the
stack.</p>

<p>Getarg SV * (*Getarg)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, CLONE_PARAMS
*param, int flags);</p>

<p>Optional. If present should return an SV * representing
the string argument passed to the layer when it was pushed.
e.g. &quot;:encoding(ascii)&quot; would return an SvPV with
value &quot;ascii&quot;. (param and flags arguments can be
ignored in most cases)</p>

<p>&quot;Dup&quot; uses &quot;Getarg&quot; to retrieve the
argument originally passed to &quot;Pushed&quot;, so you
must implement this function if your layer has an extra
argument to &quot;Pushed&quot; and will ever be
&quot;Dup&quot;ed.</p>

<p>Fileno IV (*Fileno)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Returns the Unix/Posix numeric file descriptor for the
handle. Normally &quot;PerlIOBase_fileno()&quot; (which just
asks next layer down) will suffice for this.</p>

<p>Returns -1 on error, which is considered to include the
case where the layer cannot provide such a file
descriptor.</p>

<p>Dup PerlIO * (*Dup)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, PerlIO *o,
CLONE_PARAMS *param, int flags);</p>

<p>XXX: Needs more docs.</p>

<p>Used as part of the &quot;clone&quot; process when a
thread is spawned (in which case param will be non-NULL) and
when a stream is being duplicated via &amp; in the
&quot;open&quot;.</p>

<p>Similar to &quot;Open&quot;, returns PerlIO* on success,
&quot;NULL&quot; on failure.</p>

<p>Read SSize_t (*Read)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, void *vbuf, Size_t
count);</p>

<p>Basic read operation.</p>

<p>Typically will call &quot;Fill&quot; and manipulate
pointers (possibly via the API).
&quot;PerlIOBuf_read()&quot; may be suitable for derived
classes which provide &quot;fast gets&quot; methods.</p>

<p>Returns actual bytes read, or -1 on an error.</p>

<p>Unread SSize_t (*Unread)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, const void
*vbuf, Size_t count);</p>

<p>A superset of stdios &quot;ungetc()&quot;. Should
arrange for future reads to see the bytes in
&quot;vbuf&quot;. If there is no obviously better
implementation then &quot;PerlIOBase_unread()&quot; provides
the function by pushing a &quot;fake&quot;
&quot;pending&quot; layer above the calling layer.</p>

<p>Returns the number of unread chars.</p>

<p>Write SSize_t (*Write)(PerlIO *f, const void *vbuf,
Size_t count);</p>

<p>Basic write operation.</p>

<p>Returns bytes written or -1 on an error.</p>

<p>Seek IV (*Seek)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, Off_t offset, int
whence);</p>

<p>Position the file pointer. Should normally call its own
&quot;Flush&quot; method and then the &quot;Seek&quot;
method of next layer down.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.</p>

<p>Tell Off_t (*Tell)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Return the file pointer. May be based on layers cached
concept of position to avoid overhead.</p>

<p>Returns -1 on failure to get the file pointer.</p>

<p>Close IV (*Close)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Close the stream. Should normally call
&quot;PerlIOBase_close()&quot; to flush itself and close
layers below, and then deallocate any data structures
(buffers, translation tables, ...) not held directly in the
data structure.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.</p>

<p>Flush IV (*Flush)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Should make stream s state consistent with layers below.
That is, any buffered write data should be written, and file
position of lower layers adjusted for data read from below
but not actually consumed. (Should perhaps
&quot;Unread()&quot; such data to the lower layer.)</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.</p>

<p>Fill IV (*Fill)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>The buffer for this layer should be filled (for read)
from layer below. When you &quot;subclass&quot; PerlIOBuf
layer, you want to use its _read method and to supply your
own fill method, which fills the PerlIOBufs buffer.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.</p>

<p>Eof IV (*Eof)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Return end-of-file indicator.
&quot;PerlIOBase_eof()&quot; is normally sufficient.</p>

<p>Returns 0 on end-of-file, 1 if not end-of-file, -1 on
error.</p>

<p>Error IV (*Error)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Return error indicator. &quot;PerlIOBase_error()&quot;
is normally sufficient.</p>

<p>Returns 1 if there is an error (usually when
&quot;PERLIO_F_ERROR&quot; is set, 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>Clearerr void (*Clearerr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Clear end-of-file and error indicators. Should call
&quot;PerlIOBase_clearerr()&quot; to set the
&quot;PERLIO_F_XXXXX&quot; flags, which may suffice.</p>

<p>Setlinebuf void (*Setlinebuf)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Mark the stream as line buffered.
&quot;PerlIOBase_setlinebuf()&quot; sets the
PERLIO_F_LINEBUF flag and is normally sufficient.</p>

<p>Get_base STDCHAR * (*Get_base)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Allocate (if not already done so) the read buffer for
this layer and return pointer to it. Return NULL on
failure.</p>

<p>Get_bufsiz Size_t (*Get_bufsiz)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Return the number of bytes that last &quot;Fill()&quot;
put in the buffer.</p>

<p>Get_ptr STDCHAR * (*Get_ptr)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Return the current read pointer relative to this layer s
buffer.</p>

<p>Get_cnt SSize_t (*Get_cnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f);</p>

<p>Return the number of bytes left to be read in the
current buffer.</p>

<p>Set_ptrcnt void (*Set_ptrcnt)(pTHX_ PerlIO *f, STDCHAR
*ptr, SSize_t cnt);</p>

<p>Adjust the read pointer and count of bytes to match
&quot;ptr&quot; and/or &quot;cnt&quot;. The application (or
layer above) must ensure they are consistent. (Checking is
allowed by the paranoid.)</p>

<p>Utilities To ask for the next layer down use
PerlIONext(PerlIO *f).</p>

<p>To check that a PerlIO* is valid use PerlIOValid(PerlIO
*f). (All this does is really just to check that the pointer
is non-NULL and that the pointer behind that is
non-NULL.)</p>

<p>PerlIOBase(PerlIO *f) returns the &quot;Base&quot;
pointer, or in other words, the &quot;PerlIOl*&quot;
pointer.</p>

<p>PerlIOSelf(PerlIO* f, type) return the PerlIOBase cast
to a type.</p>

<p>Perl_PerlIO_or_Base(PerlIO* f, callback, base, failure,
args) either calls the callback from the functions of the
layer f (just by the name of the IO function, like
&quot;Read&quot;) with the args, or if there is no such
callback, calls the base version of the callback with the
same args, or if the f is invalid, set errno to EBADF and
return failure.</p>

<p>Perl_PerlIO_or_fail(PerlIO* f, callback, failure, args)
either calls the callback of the functions of the layer f
with the args, or if there is no such callback, set errno to
EINVAL. Or if the f is invalid, set errno to EBADF and
return failure.</p>

<p>Perl_PerlIO_or_Base_void(PerlIO* f, callback, base,
args) either calls the callback of the functions of the
layer f with the args, or if there is no such callback,
calls the base version of the callback with the same args,
or if the f is invalid, set errno to EBADF.</p>

<p>Perl_PerlIO_or_fail_void(PerlIO* f, callback, args)
either calls the callback of the functions of the layer f
with the args, or if there is no such callback, set errno to
EINVAL. Or if the f is invalid, set errno to EBADF.</p>

<p>Implementing PerlIO Layers If you find the
implementation document unclear or not sufficient, look at
the existing PerlIO layer implementations, which
include:</p>

<p>&middot; C implementations</p>

<p>The perlio.c and perliol.h in the Perl core implement
the &quot;unix&quot;, &quot;perlio&quot;, &quot;stdio&quot;,
&quot;crlf&quot;, &quot;utf8&quot;, &quot;byte&quot;,
&quot;raw&quot;, &quot;pending&quot; layers, and also the
&quot;mmap&quot; and &quot;win32&quot; layers if applicable.
(The &quot;win32&quot; is currently unfinished and unused,
to see what is used instead in Win32, see &quot;Querying the
layers of filehandles&quot; in PerlIO .)</p>

<p>PerlIO::encoding, PerlIO::scalar, PerlIO::via in the
Perl core.</p>

<p>PerlIO::gzip and APR::PerlIO (mod_perl 2.0) on CPAN.</p>

<p>&middot; Perl implementations</p>

<p>PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint in the Perl core and
PerlIO::via::* on CPAN.</p>

<p>If you are creating a PerlIO layer, you may want to be
lazy, in other words, implement only the methods that
interest you. The other methods you can either replace with
the &quot;blank&quot; methods</p>

<p>PerlIOBase_noop_ok PerlIOBase_noop_fail</p>

<p>(which do nothing, and return zero and -1, respectively)
or for certain methods you may assume a default behaviour by
using a NULL method. The Open method looks for help in the
parent layer. The following table summarizes the
behaviour:</p>

<p>method behaviour with NULL</p>

<p>Clearerr PerlIOBase_clearerr Close PerlIOBase_close Dup
PerlIOBase_dup Eof PerlIOBase_eof Error PerlIOBase_error
Fileno PerlIOBase_fileno Fill FAILURE Flush SUCCESS Getarg
SUCCESS Get_base FAILURE Get_bufsiz FAILURE Get_cnt FAILURE
Get_ptr FAILURE Open INHERITED Popped SUCCESS Pushed SUCCESS
Read PerlIOBase_read Seek FAILURE Set_cnt FAILURE Set_ptrcnt
FAILURE Setlinebuf PerlIOBase_setlinebuf Tell FAILURE Unread
PerlIOBase_unread Write FAILURE</p>

<p>FAILURE Set errno (to EINVAL in UNIXish, to LIB$_INVARG
in VMS) and return -1 (for numeric return values) or NULL
(for pointers) INHERITED Inherited from the layer below
SUCCESS Return 0 (for numeric return values) or a
pointer</p>

<p>Core Layers The file &quot;perlio.c&quot; provides the
following layers:</p>

<p>&quot;unix&quot; A basic non-buffered layer which calls
Unix/POSIX &quot;read()&quot;, &quot;write()&quot;,
&quot;lseek()&quot;, &quot;close()&quot;. No buffering. Even
on platforms that distinguish between O_TEXT and O_BINARY
this layer is always O_BINARY.</p>

<p>&quot;perlio&quot; A very complete generic buffering
layer which provides the whole of PerlIO API. It is also
intended to be used as a &quot;base class&quot; for other
layers. (For example its &quot;Read()&quot; method is
implemented in terms of the
&quot;Get_cnt()&quot;/&quot;Get_ptr()&quot;/&quot;Set_ptrcnt()&quot;
methods).</p>

<p>&quot;perlio&quot; over &quot;unix&quot; provides a
complete replacement for stdio as seen via PerlIO API. This
is the default for USE_PERLIO when system s stdio does not
permit perl s &quot;fast gets&quot; access, and which do not
distinguish between &quot;O_TEXT&quot; and
&quot;O_BINARY&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;stdio&quot; A layer which provides the PerlIO API
via the layer scheme, but implements it by calling system s
stdio. This is (currently) the default if systems stdio
provides sufficient access to allow perl s &quot;fast
gets&quot; access and which do not distinguish between
&quot;O_TEXT&quot; and &quot;O_BINARY&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;crlf&quot; A layer derived using
&quot;perlio&quot; as a base class. It provides Win32-like
&quot;0 to CR,LF translation. Can either be applied above
&quot;perlio&quot; or serve as the buffer layer itself.
&quot;crlf&quot; over &quot;unix&quot; is the default if
system distinguishes between &quot;O_TEXT&quot; and
&quot;O_BINARY&quot; opens. (At some point &quot;unix&quot;
will be replaced by a &quot;native&quot; Win32 IO layer on
that platform, as Win32s read/write layer has various
drawbacks.) The &quot;crlf&quot; layer is a reasonable model
for a layer which transforms data in some way.</p>

<p>&quot;mmap&quot; If Configure detects &quot;mmap()&quot;
functions this layer is provided (with &quot;perlio&quot; as
a &quot;base&quot;) which does &quot;read&quot; operations
by mmap()ing the file. Performance improvement is marginal
on modern systems, so it is mainly there as a proof of
concept. It is likely to be unbundled from the core at some
point. The &quot;mmap&quot; layer is a reasonable model for
a minimalist &quot;derived&quot; layer.</p>

<p>&quot;pending&quot; An &quot;internal&quot; derivative
of &quot;perlio&quot; which can be used to provide Unread()
function for layers which have no buffer or cannot be
bothered. (Basically this layers &quot;Fill()&quot; pops
itself off the stack and so resumes reading from layer
below.)</p>

<p>&quot;raw&quot; A dummy layer which never exists on the
layer stack. Instead when &quot;pushed&quot; it actually
pops the stack removing itself, it then calls Binmode
function table entry on all the layers in the stack -
normally this (via PerlIOBase_binmode) removes any layers
which do not have &quot;PERLIO_K_RAW&quot; bit set. Layers
can modify that behaviour by defining their own Binmode
entry.</p>

<p>&quot;utf8&quot; Another dummy layer. When pushed it
pops itself and sets the &quot;PERLIO_F_UTF8&quot; flag on
the layer which was (and now is once more) the top of the
stack.</p>

<p>In addition perlio.c also provides a number of
&quot;PerlIOBase_xxxx()&quot; functions which are intended
to be used in the table slots of classes which do not need
to do anything special for a particular method.</p>

<p>Extension Layers Layers can made available by extension
modules. When an unknown layer is encountered the PerlIO
code will perform the equivalent of :</p>

<p>use PerlIO &rsquo;layer&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Where layer is the unknown layer. PerlIO.pm will then
attempt to:</p>

<p>require PerlIO::layer;</p>

<p>If after that process the layer is still not defined
then the &quot;open&quot; will fail.</p>

<p>The following extension layers are bundled with
perl:</p>

<p>&quot;:encoding&quot; use Encoding;</p>

<p>makes this layer available, although PerlIO.pm
&quot;knows&quot; where to find it. It is an example of a
layer which takes an argument as it is called thus:</p>

<p>open( $fh, &quot;&lt;:encoding(iso-8859-7)&quot;,
$pathname );</p>

<p>&quot;:scalar&quot; Provides support for reading data
from and writing data to a scalar.</p>

<p>open( $fh, &quot;+&lt;:scalar&quot;, calar );</p>

<p>When a handle is so opened, then reads get bytes from
the string value of $scalar, and writes change the value. In
both cases the position in $scalar starts as zero but can be
altered via &quot;seek&quot;, and determined via
&quot;tell&quot;.</p>

<p>Please note that this layer is implied when calling
open() thus:</p>

<p>open( $fh, &quot;+&lt;&quot;, calar );</p>

<p>&quot;:via&quot; Provided to allow layers to be
implemented as Perl code. For instance:</p>

<p>use PerlIO::via::StripHTML; open( my $fh,
&quot;&lt;:via(StripHTML)&quot;, &quot;index.html&quot;
);</p>

<p>See PerlIO::via for details.</p>

<p>TODO Things that need to be done to improve this
document.</p>

<p>&middot; Explain how to make a valid fh without going
through open()(i.e. apply a layer). For example if the file
is not opened through perl, but we want to get back a fh,
like it was opened by Perl.</p>

<p>How PerlIO_apply_layera fits in, where its docs, was it
made public?</p>

<p>Currently the example could be something like this:</p>

<p>PerlIO *foo_to_PerlIO(pTHX_ char *mode, ...) { char
*mode; /* &quot;w&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, etc */ const char
*layers = &quot;:APR&quot;; /* the layer name */ PerlIO *f =
PerlIO_allocate(aTHX); if (!f) { return NULL; }</p>

<p>PerlIO_apply_layers(aTHX_ f, mode, layers);</p>

<p>if (f) { PerlIOAPR *st = PerlIOSelf(f, PerlIOAPR); /*
fill in the st struct, as in _open() */ st-&gt;file = file;
PerlIOBase(f)-&gt;flags |= PERLIO_F_OPEN;</p>

<p>return f; } return NULL; }</p>

<p>&middot; fix/add the documentation in places marked as
XXX.</p>

<p>&middot; The handling of errors by the layer is not
specified. e.g. when $! should be set explicitly, when the
error handling should be just delegated to the top
layer.</p>

<p>Probably give some hints on using SETERRNO() or pointers
to where they can be found.</p>

<p>&middot; I think it would help to give some concrete
examples to make it easier to understand the API. Of course
I agree that the API has to be concise, but since there is
no second document that is more of a guide, I think that itd
make it easier to start with the doc which is an API, but
has examples in it in places where things are unclear, to a
person who is not a PerlIO guru (yet).</p>
