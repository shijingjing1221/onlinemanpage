<p>NAME dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dmesg [-c] [-r] [-n level] [-s bufsize]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dmesg is used to examine or control the
kernel ring buffer.</p>

<p>The program helps users to print out their bootup
messages. Instead of copying the messages by hand, the user
need only: dmesg &gt; boot.messages and mail the
boot.messages file to whoever can debug their problem.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c Clear the ring buffer contents after
printing.</p>

<p>-r Print the raw message buffer, i.e., dont strip the
log level prefixes.</p>

<p>-s bufsize Use a buffer of size bufsize to query the
kernel ring buffer. This is 16392 by default. (The default
kernel syslog buffer size was 4096 at first, 8192 since
1.3.54, 16384 since 2.1.113.) If you have set the kernel
buffer to be larger than the default then this option can be
used to view the entire buffer.</p>

<p>-n level Set the level at which logging of messages is
done to the con- sole. For example, -n 1 prevents all
messages, except panic messages, from appearing on the
console. All levels of messages are still written to
/proc/kmsg, so syslogd(8) can still be used to control
exactly where kernel messages appear. When the -n option is
used, dmesg will not print or clear the kernel ring
buffer.</p>

<p>When both options are used, only the last option on the
command line will have an effect.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO syslogd(8)</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The dmesg command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
