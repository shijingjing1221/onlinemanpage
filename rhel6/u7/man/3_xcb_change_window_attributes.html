<p>xcb_change_window_attributes(3) XCB Requests
xcb_change_window_attributes(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_change_window_attributes - change window
attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_void_cookie_t
xcb_change_window_attributes(xcb_connection_t *conn,
xcb_window_t window, uint32_t value_mask, const uint32_t
*value_list);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>window The window to change.</p>

<p>value_mask One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BACK_PIXMAP Overrides the default
background-pixmap. The back- ground pixmap and window must
have the same root and same depth. Any size pixmap can be
used, al- though some sizes may be faster than others.</p>

<p>If XCB_BACK_PIXMAP_NONE is specified, the window has no
defined background. The server may fill the contents with
the previous screen contents or with contents of its own
choosing.</p>

<p>If XCB_BACK_PIXMAP_PARENT_RELATIVE is specified, the
parent s background is used, but the window must have the
same depth as the parent (or a Match error results). The
parent s background is tracked, and the current version is
used each time the window background is required.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BACK_PIXEL Overrides BackPixmap. A pixmap of
undefined size filled with the specified background pixel is
used for the background. Range-checking is not per- formed,
the background pixel is truncated to the appropriate number
of bits.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BORDER_PIXMAP Overrides the default
border-pixmap. The border pixmap and window must have the
same root and the same depth. Any size pixmap can be used,
although some sizes may be faster than others.</p>

<p>The special value XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT means the parent
s border pixmap is copied (subsequent changes to the parent
s border attribute do not af- fect the child), but the
window must have the same depth as the parent.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BORDER_PIXEL Overrides BorderPixmap. A pixmap of
undefined size filled with the specified border pixel is
used for the border. Range checking is not performed on the
border-pixel value, it is truncated to the appro- priate
number of bits.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BIT_GRAVITY Defines which region of the window
should be re- tained if the window is resized.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_WIN_GRAVITY Defines how the window should be
repositioned if the parent is resized (see
ConfigureWindow).</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BACKING_STORE A backing-store of WhenMapped
advises the server that maintaining contents of obscured
regions when the window is mapped would be beneficial. A
back- ing-store of Always advises the server that main-
taining contents even when the window is unmapped would be
beneficial. In this case, the server may generate an
exposure event when the window is cre- ated. A value of
NotUseful advises the server that maintaining contents is
unnecessary, although a server may still choose to maintain
contents while the window is mapped. Note that if the server
main- tains contents, then the server should maintain
complete contents not just the region within the parent
boundaries, even if the window is larger than its parent.
While the server maintains con- tents, exposure events will
not normally be gener- ated, but the server may stop
maintaining contents at any time.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BACKING_PLANES The backing-planes indicates (with
bits set to 1) which bit planes of the window hold dynamic
data that must be preserved in backing-stores and during
save-unders.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_BACKING_PIXEL The backing-pixel specifies what
value to use in planes not covered by backing-planes. The
server is free to save only the specified bit planes in the
backing-store or save-under and regenerate the re- maining
planes with the specified pixel value. Any bits beyond the
specified depth of the window in these values are simply
ignored.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_OVERRIDE_REDIRECT The override-redirect specifies
whether map and configure requests on this window should
override a SubstructureRedirect on the parent, typically to
inform a window manager not to tamper with the win- dow.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_SAVE_UNDER If 1, the server is advised that when
this window is mapped, saving the contents of windows it ob-
scures would be beneficial.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_EVENT_MASK The event-mask defines which events
the client is interested in for this window (or for some
event types, inferiors of the window).</p>

<p>XCB_CW_DONT_PROPAGATE The do-not-propagate-mask defines
which events should not be propagated to ancestor windows
when no client has the event type selected in this win-
dow.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_COLORMAP The colormap specifies the colormap that
best re- flects the true colors of the window. Servers capa-
ble of supporting multiple hardware colormaps may use this
information, and window man- agers may use it for
InstallColormap requests. The colormap must have the same
visual type and root as the window (or a Match error
results). If CopyFromParent is specified, the parent s
colormap is copied (subse- quent changes to the parents
colormap attribute do not affect the child). However, the
window must have the same visual type as the parent (or a
Match error results), and the parent must not have a col-
ormap of None (or a Match error results). For an explanation
of None, see FreeColormap request. The colormap is copied by
sharing the colormap object between the child and the
parent, not by making a complete copy of the colormap
contents.</p>

<p>XCB_CW_CURSOR If a cursor is specified, it will be used
whenever the pointer is in the window. If None is speci-
fied, the parents cursor will be used when the pointer is in
the window, and any change in the parents cursor will cause
an immediate change in the displayed cursor.</p>

<p>value_list Values for each of the attributes specified
in the bitmask value_mask. The order has to correspond to
the order of pos- sible value_mask bits. See the
example.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Changes the attributes specified by
value_mask for the specified win- dow.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if
any) have to be handled in the event loop.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors directly with
xcb_request_check instead, use
xcb_change_window_attributes_checked. See xcb-requests(3)
for de- tails.</p>
