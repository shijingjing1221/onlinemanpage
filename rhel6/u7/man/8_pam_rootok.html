<p>PAM_ROOTOK(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_ROOTOK(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_rootok - Gain only root access</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_rootok.so [debug]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_rootok is a PAM module that
authenticates the user if their UID is 0. Applications that
are created setuid-root generally retain the UID of the user
but run with the authority of an enhanced effective-UID. It
is the real UID that is checked.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the auth type is
provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS The UID is 0.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR The UID is not 0.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In the case of the su(1) application the
historical usage is to permit the superuser to adopt the
identity of a lesser user without the use of a password. To
obtain this behavior with PAM the following pair of lines
are needed for the corresponding entry in the /etc/pam.d/su
configuration file:</p>

<p># su authentication. Root is granted access by default.
auth sufficient pam_rootok.so auth required pam_unix.so</p>

<p>SEE ALSO su(1), pam.conf(5), pam.d(5), pam(8)</p>
