<p>OPEN(2) Linux Programmer s Manual OPEN(2)</p>

<p>NAME open, creat - open and possibly create a file or
device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt; #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int open(const char *pathname, int flags); int
open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>int creat(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Given a pathname for a file, open() returns
a file descriptor, a small, non-negative integer for use in
subsequent system calls (read(2), write(2), lseek(2),
fcntl(2), etc.). The file descriptor returned by a
successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor
not cur- rently open for the process.</p>

<p>By default, the new file descriptor is set to remain
open across an execve(2) (i.e., the FD_CLOEXEC file
descriptor flag described in fcntl(2) is initially disabled;
the Linux-specific O_CLOEXEC flag, described below, can be
used to change this default). The file offset is set to the
beginning of the file (see lseek(2)).</p>

<p>A call to open() creates a new open file description, an
entry in the system-wide table of open files. This entry
records the file offset and the file status flags
(modifiable via the fcntl(2) F_SETFL opera- tion). A file
descriptor is a reference to one of these entries; this
reference is unaffected if pathname is subsequently removed
or modified to refer to a different file. The new open file
description is ini- tially not shared with any other
process, but sharing may arise via fork(2).</p>

<p>The argument flags must include one of the following
access modes: O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR. These request
opening the file read- only, write-only, or read/write,
respectively.</p>

<p>In addition, zero or more file creation flags and file
status flags can be bitwise-ord in flags. The file creation
flags are O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_NOCTTY, and O_TRUNC. The file
status flags are all of the remaining flags listed below.
The distinction between these two groups of flags is that
the file status flags can be retrieved and (in some cases)
mod- ified using fcntl(2). The full list of file creation
flags and file status flags is as follows:</p>

<p>O_APPEND The file is opened in append mode. Before each
write(2), the file offset is positioned at the end of the
file, as if with lseek(2). O_APPEND may lead to corrupted
files on NFS file sys- tems if more than one process appends
data to a file at once. This is because NFS does not support
appending to a file, so the client kernel has to simulate
it, which can t be done without a race condition.</p>

<p>O_ASYNC Enable signal-driven I/O: generate a signal
(SIGIO by default, but this can be changed via fcntl(2))
when input or output becomes possible on this file
descriptor. This feature is only available for terminals,
pseudo-terminals, sockets, and (since Linux 2.6) pipes and
FIFOs. See fcntl(2) for further details.</p>

<p>O_CLOEXEC (Since Linux 2.6.23) Enable the close-on-exec
flag for the new file descriptor. Specifying this flag
permits a program to avoid additional fcntl(2) F_SETFD
operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag. Addi- tionally, use
of this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs
since using a separate fcntl(2) F_SETFD operation to set the
FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid race condi- tions
where one thread opens a file descriptor at the same time as
another thread does a fork(2) plus execve(2).</p>

<p>O_CREAT If the file does not exist it will be created.
The owner (user ID) of the file is set to the effective user
ID of the process. The group ownership (group ID) is set
either to the effective group ID of the process or to the
group ID of the parent direc- tory (depending on file system
type and mount options, and the mode of the parent
directory, see the mount options bsdgroups and sysvgroups
described in mount(8)).</p>

<p>mode specifies the permissions to use in case a new file
is cre- ated. This argument must be supplied when O_CREAT is
specified in flags; if O_CREAT is not specified, then mode
is ignored. The effective permissions are modified by the
processs umask in the usual way: The permissions of the
created file are (mode &amp; ~umask). Note that this mode
only applies to future accesses of the newly created file;
the open() call that creates a read-only file may well
return a read/write file descriptor.</p>

<p>The following symbolic constants are provided for
mode:</p>

<p>S_IRWXU 00700 user (file owner) has read, write and
execute permission</p>

<p>S_IRUSR 00400 user has read permission</p>

<p>S_IWUSR 00200 user has write permission</p>

<p>S_IXUSR 00100 user has execute permission</p>

<p>S_IRWXG 00070 group has read, write and execute
permission</p>

<p>S_IRGRP 00040 group has read permission</p>

<p>S_IWGRP 00020 group has write permission</p>

<p>S_IXGRP 00010 group has execute permission</p>

<p>S_IRWXO 00007 others have read, write and execute
permission</p>

<p>S_IROTH 00004 others have read permission</p>

<p>S_IWOTH 00002 others have write permission</p>

<p>S_IXOTH 00001 others have execute permission</p>

<p>O_DIRECT (Since Linux 2.4.10) Try to minimize cache
effects of the I/O to and from this file. In general this
will degrade performance, but it is useful in special
situations, such as when applications do their own caching.
File I/O is done directly to/from user space buffers. The
I/O is synchronous, that is, at the completion of a read(2)
or write(2), data is guaranteed to have been transferred.
See NOTES below for further discussion.</p>

<p>A semantically similar (but deprecated) interface for
block devices is described in raw(8).</p>

<p>O_DIRECTORY If pathname is not a directory, cause the
open to fail. This flag is Linux-specific, and was added in
kernel version 2.1.126, to avoid denial-of-service problems
if opendir(3) is called on a FIFO or tape device, but should
not be used outside of the implementation of opendir(3).</p>

<p>O_EXCL Ensure that this call creates the file: if this
flag is speci- fied in conjunction with O_CREAT, and
pathname already exists, then open() will fail. The behavior
of O_EXCL is undefined if O_CREAT is not specified.</p>

<p>When these two flags are specified, symbolic links are
not fol- lowed: if pathname is a symbolic link, then open()
fails regard- less of where the symbolic link points to.</p>

<p>O_EXCL is only supported on NFS when using NFSv3 or
later on kernel 2.6 or later. In environments where NFS
O_EXCL support is not provided, programs that rely on it for
performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.
Portable programs that want to perform atomic file locking
using a lockfile, and need to avoid reliance on NFS support
for O_EXCL, can create a unique file on the same file system
(e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and use link(2) to
make a link to the lockfile. If link(2) returns 0, the lock
is successful. Otherwise, use stat(2) on the unique file to
check if its link count has increased to 2, in which case
the lock is also successful.</p>

<p>O_LARGEFILE (LFS) Allow files whose sizes cannot be
represented in an off_t (but can be represented in an
off64_t) to be opened. The _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE macro must be
defined in order to obtain this definition. Setting the
_FILE_OFFSET_BITS feature test macro to 64 (rather than
using O_LARGEFILE) is the preferred method of obtaining
method of accessing large files on 32-bit systems (see
feature_test_macros(7)).</p>

<p>O_NOATIME (Since Linux 2.6.8) Do not update the file
last access time (st_atime in the inode) when the file is
read(2). This flag is intended for use by indexing or backup
programs, where its use can significantly reduce the amount
of disk activity. This flag may not be effec- tive on all
file systems. One example is NFS, where the server maintains
the access time.</p>

<p>O_NOCTTY If pathname refers to a terminal device see
tty(4) it will not become the processs controlling terminal
even if the pro- cess does not have one.</p>

<p>O_NOFOLLOW If pathname is a symbolic link, then the open
fails. This is a FreeBSD extension, which was added to Linux
in version 2.1.126. Symbolic links in earlier components of
the pathname will still be followed.</p>

<p>O_NONBLOCK or O_NDELAY When possible, the file is opened
in non-blocking mode. Neither the open() nor any subsequent
operations on the file descriptor which is returned will
cause the calling process to wait. For the handling of FIFOs
(named pipes), see also fifo(7). For a discussion of the
effect of O_NONBLOCK in conjunction with mandatory file
locks and with file leases, see fcntl(2).</p>

<p>O_SYNC The file is opened for synchronous I/O. Any
write(2)s on the resulting file descriptor will block the
calling process until the data has been physically written
to the underlying hardware. But see NOTES below.</p>

<p>O_TRUNC If the file already exists and is a regular file
and the open mode allows writing (i.e., is O_RDWR or
O_WRONLY) it will be truncated to length 0. If the file is a
FIFO or terminal device file, the O_TRUNC flag is ignored.
Otherwise the effect of O_TRUNC is unspecified.</p>

<p>Some of these optional flags can be altered using
fcntl(2) after the file has been opened.</p>

<p>creat() is equivalent to open() with flags equal to
O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE open() and creat() return the new file
descriptor, or -1 if an error occurred (in which case, errno
is set appropriately).</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES The requested access to the file is not
allowed, or search per- mission is denied for one of the
directories in the path prefix of pathname, or the file did
not exist yet and write access to the parent directory is
not allowed. (See also path_resolu- tion(7).)</p>

<p>EEXIST pathname already exists and O_CREAT and O_EXCL
were used.</p>

<p>EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EFBIG See EOVERFLOW.</p>

<p>EINTR While blocked waiting to complete an open of a
slow device (e.g., a FIFO; see fifo(7)), the call was
interrupted by a sig- nal handler; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EISDIR pathname refers to a directory and the access
requested involved writing (that is, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR is
set).</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving pathname, or O_NOFOLLOW was specified but pathname
was a symbolic link.</p>

<p>EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of
files open.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG pathname was too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENODEV pathname refers to a device special file and no
corresponding device exists. (This is a Linux kernel bug; in
this situation ENXIO must be returned.)</p>

<p>ENOENT O_CREAT is not set and the named file does not
exist. Or, a directory component in pathname does not exist
or is a dangling symbolic link.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOSPC pathname was to be created but the device
containing pathname has no room for the new file.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in pathname is
not, in fact, a directory, or O_DIRECTORY was specified and
pathname was not a directory.</p>

<p>ENXIO O_NONBLOCK | O_WRONLY is set, the named file is a
FIFO and no process has the file open for reading. Or, the
file is a device special file and no corresponding device
exists.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW pathname refers to a regular file that is too
large to be opened. The usual scenario here is that an
application compiled on a 32-bit platform without
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 tried to open a file whose size
exceeds (2&lt;&lt;31)-1 bits; see also O_LARGE- FILE above.
This is the error specified by POSIX.1-2001; in kernels
before 2.6.24, Linux gave the error EFBIG for this case.</p>

<p>EPERM The O_NOATIME flag was specified, but the
effective user ID of the caller did not match the owner of
the file and the caller was not privileged (CAP_FOWNER).</p>

<p>EROFS pathname refers to a file on a read-only file
system and write access was requested.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY pathname refers to an executable image which is
currently being executed and write access was requested.</p>

<p>EWOULDBLOCK The O_NONBLOCK flag was specified, and an
incompatible lease was held on the file (see fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001. The
O_DIRECTORY, O_NOATIME, and O_NOFOLLOW flags are
Linux-specific, and one may need to define _GNU_SOURCE to
obtain their definitions.</p>

<p>The O_CLOEXEC flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, but
is specified in POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<p>O_DIRECT is not specified in POSIX; one has to define
_GNU_SOURCE to get its definition.</p>

<p>NOTES Under Linux, the O_NONBLOCK flag indicates that
one wants to open but does not necessarily have the
intention to read or write. This is typ- ically used to open
devices in order to get a file descriptor for use with
ioctl(2).</p>

<p>Unlike the other values that can be specified in flags,
the access mode values O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR, do
not specify individual bits. Rather, they define the low
order two bits of flags, and are defined respectively as 0,
1, and 2. In other words, the combination O_RDONLY |
O_WRONLY is a logical error, and certainly does not have the
same meaning as O_RDWR. Linux reserves the special,
non-standard access mode 3 (binary 11) in flags to mean:
check for read and write permis- sion on the file and return
a descriptor that cant be used for reading or writing. This
non-standard access mode is used by some Linux drivers to
return a descriptor that is only to be used for device-spe-
cific ioctl(2) operations.</p>

<p>The (undefined) effect of O_RDONLY | O_TRUNC varies
among implementa- tions. On many systems the file is
actually truncated.</p>

<p>There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying
NFS, affecting amongst others O_SYNC and O_NDELAY.</p>

<p>POSIX provides for three different variants of
synchronized I/O, corre- sponding to the flags O_SYNC,
O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC. Currently (2.1.130) these are all
synonymous under Linux.</p>

<p>Note that open() can open device special files, but
creat() cannot cre- ate them; use mknod(2) instead.</p>

<p>On NFS file systems with UID mapping enabled, open() may
return a file descriptor but, for example, read(2) requests
are denied with EACCES. This is because the client performs
open() by checking the permissions, but UID mapping is
performed by the server upon read and write requests.</p>

<p>If the file is newly created, its st_atime, st_ctime,
st_mtime fields (respectively, time of last access, time of
last status change, and time of last modification; see
stat(2)) are set to the current time, and so are the
st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the parent directory.
Otherwise, if the file is modified because of the O_TRUNC
flag, its st_ctime and st_mtime fields are set to the
current time.</p>

<p>O_DIRECT The O_DIRECT flag may impose alignment
restrictions on the length and address of userspace buffers
and the file offset of I/Os. In Linux alignment restrictions
vary by file system and kernel version and might be absent
entirely. However there is currently no file system-indepen-
dent interface for an application to discover these
restrictions for a given file or file system. Some file
systems provide their own inter- faces for doing so, for
example the XFS_IOC_DIOINFO operation in xfsctl(3).</p>

<p>Under Linux 2.4, transfer sizes, and the alignment of
the user buffer and the file offset must all be multiples of
the logical block size of the file system. Under Linux 2.6,
alignment to 512-byte boundaries suffices.</p>

<p>O_DIRECT I/Os should never be run concurrently with the
fork(2) system call, if the memory buffer is a private
mapping (i.e., any mapping cre- ated with the mmap(2)
MAP_PRIVATE flag; this includes memory allocated on the heap
and statically allocated buffers). Any such I/Os, whether
submitted via an asynchronous I/O interface or from another
thread in the process, should be completed before fork(2) is
called. Failure to do so can result in data corruption and
undefined behavior in parent and child processes. This
restriction does not apply when the memory buffer for the
O_DIRECT I/Os was created using shmat(2) or mmap(2) with the
MAP_SHARED flag. Nor does this restriction apply when the
memory buffer has been advised as MADV_DONTFORK with
madvise(2), ensuring that it will not be available to the
child after fork(2).</p>

<p>The O_DIRECT flag was introduced in SGI IRIX, where it
has alignment restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4.
IRIX has also a fcntl(2) call to query appropriate
alignments, and sizes. FreeBSD 4.x intro- duced a flag of
the same name, but without alignment restrictions.</p>

<p>O_DIRECT support was added under Linux in kernel version
2.4.10. Older Linux kernels simply ignore this flag. Some
file systems may not implement the flag and open() will fail
with EINVAL if it is used.</p>

<p>Applications should avoid mixing O_DIRECT and normal I/O
to the same file, and especially to overlapping byte regions
in the same file. Even when the file system correctly
handles the coherency issues in this situation, overall I/O
throughput is likely to be slower than using either mode
alone. Likewise, applications should avoid mixing mmap(2) of
files with direct I/O to the same files.</p>

<p>The behaviour of O_DIRECT with NFS will differ from
local file systems. Older kernels, or kernels configured in
certain ways, may not support this combination. The NFS
protocol does not support passing the flag to the server, so
O_DIRECT I/O will only bypass the page cache on the client;
the server may still cache the I/O. The client asks the
server to make the I/O synchronous to preserve the
synchronous semantics of O_DIRECT. Some servers will perform
poorly under these circumstances, especially if the I/O size
is small. Some servers may also be config- ured to lie to
clients about the I/O having reached stable storage; this
will avoid the performance penalty at some risk to data
integrity in the event of server power failure. The Linux
NFS client places no alignment restrictions on O_DIRECT
I/O.</p>

<p>In summary, O_DIRECT is a potentially powerful tool that
should be used with caution. It is recommended that
applications treat use of O_DIRECT as a performance option
which is disabled by default.</p>

<p>&quot;The thing that has always disturbed me about
O_DIRECT is that the whole interface is just stupid, and was
probably designed by a deranged monkey on some serious
mind-controlling substances.&quot; Linus</p>

<p>BUGS Currently, it is not possible to enable
signal-driven I/O by specifying O_ASYNC when calling open();
use fcntl(2) to enable this flag.</p>
