<p>VGREDUCE(8) VGREDUCE(8)</p>

<p>NAME vgreduce reduce a volume group</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vgreduce [-a|--all] [-A|--autobackup {y|n}]
[--commandprofile Profile- Name] [-d|--debug] [-h|-?|--help]
[--removemissing] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose] VolumeGroupName
[PhysicalVolumePath...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vgreduce allows you to remove one or more
unused physical volumes from a volume group.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-a, --all Removes all empty physical volumes if none are
given on command line.</p>

<p>--removemissing Removes all missing physical volumes
from the volume group, if there are no logical volumes
allocated on those. This resumes normal operation of the
volume group (new logical volumes may again be created,
changed and so on).</p>

<p>If this is not possible (there are logical volumes
referencing the missing physical volumes) and you cannot or
do not want to remove them manually, you can run this option
with --force to have vgreduce remove any partial LVs.</p>

<p>Any logical volumes and dependent snapshots that were
partly on the missing disks get removed completely. This
includes those parts that lie on disks that are still
present.</p>

<p>If your logical volumes spanned several disks including
the ones that are lost, you might want to try to salvage
data first by activating your logical volumes with --partial
as described in lvm(8).</p>
