<p>PMATOP(1) PMATOP(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmatop - System and Process Monitor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Interactive usage:</p>

<p>pmatop [-g|-m] [-L linelen] [-h host | -a archive]
[interval [samples]]</p>

<p>Writing and reading PCP archive folios:</p>

<p>pmatop -w rawfile [interval [samples]] pmatop -r
[rawfile] [-g|-m] [-L linelen]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The program pmatop is an interactive monitor
to view the load on a Linux system. It shows the occupation
of the most critical hardware resources (from a performance
point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory, disk and
network. By default metrics from the local host are
displayed, but a different host may be specified with the
-h/--host option, or from a PCP archive using the
-a/--archive option.</p>

<p>It is modeled on atop(1) and provides a showcase for the
variety of data available from pmcd(1).</p>

<p>Every interval (default: 10 seconds) information is
shown about the resource occupation on system level (cpu,
memory, disks and network layers), followed by a list of
processes which have been active during the last interval If
the list of active processes does not entirely fit on the
screen, only the top of the list is shown. The intervals are
repeated till the number of samples (specified as command
argument) is reached, or till the key q is pressed in inter-
active mode.</p>

<p>When pmatop is started, it checks whether the standard
output channel is connected to a screen, or to a file/pipe.
In the first case it pro- duces screen control codes (via
the ncurses library) and behaves inter- actively; in the
second case it produces flat ASCII-output.</p>

<p>In interactive mode, the output of pmatop scales
dynamically to the current dimensions of the
screen/window.</p>

<p>Furthermore in interactive mode the output of pmatop can
be controlled by pressing particular keys. However it is
also possible to specify such key as flag on the command
line. In that case pmatop switches to the indicated mode on
beforehand; this mode can be modified again interactively.
Specifying such key as flag is especially useful when
running pmatop with output to a pipe or file
(non-interactively). These flags are the same as the keys
that can be pressed in interactive mode (see section
INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMAT The output of pmatop consists of system
level and process level infor- mation. The system level
information consists of the following output lines:</p>

<p>PRC Process and thread level totals. This line contains
the total cpu time consumed in system mode ( sys ) and in
user mode (user), the total number of processes present at
this moment ( #proc ), sleeping interruptible ( #tslpi ) and
sleeping uninterruptible (#tslpu), and the num- ber of
zombie processes (#zombie).</p>

<p>CPU The occupation percentage of this process related to
the available capacity for this resource on system level.
This line contains the total CPU usage in system mode, in
user mode, in irq mode, in idle mode, and in wait mode. The
cpu lines contain this information on a per cpu basis.</p>

<p>CPL This line contains load average information for the
last minute, five minutes, and fifteen minutes. Also the
number of context switches and the number of device
interrupts.</p>

<p>MEM This line contains the size of physical memory, free
memory, page cache, buffer cache, and slab.</p>

<p>SWP This line contains the size of swap, free swap,
committed space, and committed space limit.</p>

<p>PAG This line contains the number of page scans,
allocstalls, swapins, and swapouts.</p>

<p>LVM/MDD/DSK For every logical volume/multiple
device/hard disk one line is shown containing the
n&agrave;me, number of reads, and number of writes.</p>

<p>NET The first line is for the upper TCP/IP layer and
contains the num- ber of packets received, packets
transmitted, packets received. The next line is one per
network interface and contains the number of packets
received and number of packets transmitted.</p>

<p>PROCESS The remaining lines are one line per process and
can be controlled as described below.</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE COMMANDS When running pmatop interactively
(no output redirection), keys can be pressed to control the
output.</p>

<p>g Show generic output (default).</p>

<p>Per process the following fields are shown in case of a
window- width of 80 positions: process-id, cpu consumption
during the last interval in system- and user mode, the
virtual and resident memory growth of the process.</p>

<p>The subsequent columns are the username, number of
threads in the thread group, the status and exit code are
shown. The last columns contain the state, the occupation
percentage for the chosen resource (default: cpu) and the
process name.</p>

<p>When more than 80 positions are available, other
information is added.</p>

<p>m Show memory related output.</p>

<p>Per process the following fields are shown in case of a
window- width of 80 positions: process-id, minor and major
memory faults, size of virtual shared text, total virtual
process size, total resident process size, virtual and
resident growth during last interval, memory occupation
percentage and process name.</p>

<p>When more than 80 positions are available, other
information is added.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous interactive commands:</p>

<p>? Request for help information (also the key h can be
pressed).</p>

<p>z The pause key can be used to freeze the current
situation in order to investigate the output on the screen.
While pmatop is paused, the keys described above can be
pressed to show other information about the current list of
processes. Whenever the pause key is pressed again, pmatop
will continue with a next sample.</p>
