<p>NAME tiff2pdf - convert a TIFF image to a PDF
document</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiff2pdf [ options ] input.tiff</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tiff2pdf opens a TIFF image and writes a PDF
document to standard out- put.</p>

<p>The program converts one TIFF file to one PDF file,
including multiple page TIFF files, tiled TIFF files, black
and white. grayscale, and color TIFF files that contain data
of TIFF photometric interpretations of bilevel, grayscale,
RGB, YCbCr, CMYK separation, and ICC L*a*b* as supported by
libtiff and PDF.</p>

<p>If you have multiple TIFF files to convert into one PDF
file then use tiffcp or other program to concatenate the
files into a multiple page TIFF file. If the input TIFF file
is of huge dimensions (greater than 10000 pixels height or
width) convert the input image to a tiled TIFF if it is not
already.</p>

<p>The standard output is standard output. Set the output
file name with the -o output.pdf option.</p>

<p>All black and white files are compressed into a single
strip CCITT G4 Fax compressed PDF, unless tiled, where tiled
black and white images are compressed into tiled CCITT G4
Fax compressed PDF, libtiff CCITT support is assumed.</p>

<p>Color and grayscale data can be compressed using either
JPEG compres- sion, ITU-T T.81, or Zip/Deflate LZ77
compression. Set the compression type using the -j or -z
options. JPEG compression support requires that libtiff be
configured with JPEG support, and Zip/Deflate compres- sion
support requires that libtiff be configured with Zip
support, in tiffconf.h. Use only one or the other of -j and
-z.</p>

<p>If the input TIFF contains single strip CCITT G4 Fax
compressed infor- mation, then that is written to the PDF
file without transcoding, unless the options of no
compression and no passthrough are set, -d and -n.</p>

<p>If the input TIFF contains JPEG or single strip
Zip/Deflate compressed information, and they are configured,
then that is written to the PDF file without transcoding,
unless the options of no compression and no passthrough are
set.</p>

<p>The default page size upon which the TIFF image is
placed is determined by the resolution and extent of the
image data. Default values for the TIFF image resolution can
be set using the -x and -y options. The page size can be set
using the -p option for paper size, or -w and -l for paper
width and length, then each page of the TIFF image is
centered on its page. The distance unit for default
resolution and page width and length can be set by the -u
option, the default unit is inch.</p>

<p>Various items of the output document information can be
set with the -e, -c, -a, -t, -s, and -k options. Setting the
argument of the option to &quot;&quot; for these tags causes
the relevant document information field to be not written.
Some of the document information values otherwise get their
information from the input TIFF image, the software, author,
doc- ument name, and image description.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -o output-file Set the output to go to file.
output-file</p>

<p>-j Compress with JPEG (requires libjpeg configured with
libtiff).</p>

<p>-z Compress with Zip/Deflate (requires zlib configured
with libtiff).</p>

<p>-q quality Set the compression quality, 1-100 for
JPEG.</p>

<p>-n Do not allow data to be converted without
uncompressing, no com- pressed data passthrough.</p>

<p>-b Set PDF Interpolate user preference.</p>

<p>-d Do not compress (decompress).</p>

<p>-i Invert colors.</p>

<p>-p paper-size Set paper size, e.g., letter, legal,
A4.</p>

<p>-u [i|m] Set distance unit, i for inch, m for
centimeter.</p>

<p>-w width Set width in units.</p>

<p>-l length Set length in units.</p>

<p>-x xres Set x/width resolution default.</p>

<p>-y yres Set y/length resolution default.</p>

<p>-r [d|o] Set d for resolution default for images without
resolution, o for resolution override for all images.</p>

<p>-f Set PDF Fit Window user preference.</p>

<p>-e YYYYMMDDHHMMSS Set document information date,
overrides image or current date/time default,
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.</p>

<p>-c creator Set document information creator, overrides
image software default.</p>

<p>-a author Set document information author, overrides
image artist default.</p>

<p>-t title Set document information title, overrides image
document name default.</p>

<p>-s subject Set document information subject, overrides
image image descrip- tion default.</p>

<p>-k keywords Set document information keywords.</p>

<p>-h List usage reminder to stderr and exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example would generate the file
output.pdf from input.tiff. tiff2pdf -o output.pdf
input.tiff</p>

<p>The following example would generate PDF output from
input.tiff and write it to standard output. tiff2pdf
input.tiff</p>

<p>The following example would generate the file output.pdf
from input.tiff, putting the image pages on a letter sized
page, compressing the output with JPEG, with JPEG quality
75, setting the title to Doc- ument, and setting the Fit
Window option. tiff2pdf -p letter -j -q 75 -t
&quot;Document&quot; -f -o output.pdf input.tiff</p>
