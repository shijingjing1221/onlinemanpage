<p>PERLREPOSITORY(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLREPOSITORY(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlrepository - Using the Perl source
repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS All of Perls source code is kept centrally in a
Git repository at perl5.git.perl.org. The repository
contains many Perl revisions from Perl 1 onwards and all the
revisions from Perforce, the version control system we were
using previously. This repository is accessible in different
ways.</p>

<p>The full repository takes up about 80MB of disk space. A
check out of the blead branch (that is, the main development
branch, which contains bleadperl, the development version of
perl 5) takes up about 160MB of disk space (including the
repository). A build of bleadperl takes up about 200MB
(including the repository and the check out).</p>

<p>GETTING ACCESS TO THE REPOSITORY READ ACCESS VIA THE WEB
You may access the repository over the web. This allows you
to browse the tree, see recent commits, subscribe to RSS
feeds for the changes, search for particular commits and
more. You may access it at:</p>

<p>http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git</p>

<p>A mirror of the repository is found at:</p>

<p>http://github.com/github/perl</p>

<p>READ ACCESS VIA GIT You will need a copy of Git for your
computer. You can fetch a copy of the repository using the
Git protocol (which uses port 9418):</p>

<p>git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl-git</p>

<p>This clones the repository and makes a local copy in the
perl-git directory.</p>

<p>If your local network does not allow you to use port
9418, then you can fetch a copy of the repository over HTTP
(this is slower):</p>

<p>git clone http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git
perl-http</p>

<p>This clones the repository and makes a local copy in the
perl-http directory.</p>

<p>WRITE ACCESS TO THE REPOSITORY If you are a committer,
then you can fetch a copy of the repository that you can
push back on with:</p>

<p>git clone ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/gitroot/perl.git
perl-ssh</p>

<p>This clones the repository and makes a local copy in the
perl-ssh directory.</p>

<p>If you cloned using the git protocol, which is faster
than ssh, then you will need to modify your config in order
to enable pushing. Edit .git/config where you will see
something like:</p>

<p>[remote &quot;origin&quot;] url =
git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git</p>

<p>change that to something like this:</p>

<p>[remote &quot;origin&quot;] url =
ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/gitroot/perl.git</p>

<p>NOTE: there are symlinks set up so that the /gitroot is
optional and since SSH is the default protocol you can
actually shorten the &quot;url&quot; to
&quot;perl5.git.perl.org:/perl.git&quot;.</p>

<p>You can also set up your user name and e-mail address.
For example</p>

<p>% git config user.name &quot;Leon Brocard&quot; % git
config user.email acme@astray.com</p>

<p>It is also possible to keep &quot;origin&quot; as a git
remote, and add a new remote for ssh access:</p>

<p>% git remote add camel perl5.git.perl.org:/perl.git</p>

<p>This allows you to update your local repository by
pulling from &quot;origin&quot;, which is faster and doesn t
require you to authenticate, and to push your changes back
with the &quot;camel&quot; remote:</p>

<p>% git fetch camel % git push camel</p>

<p>The &quot;fetch&quot; command just updates the
&quot;camel&quot; refs, as the objects themselves should
have been fetched when pulling from &quot;origin&quot;.</p>

<p>The committers have access to 2 servers that serve
perl5.git.perl.org. One is camel.booking.com, which is the
master repository. The perl5.git.perl.org IP address also
lives on this machine. The second one is
dromedary.booking.com, which can be used for general testing
and development. Dromedary syncs the git tree from camel
every few minutes, you should not push there. Both machines
also have a full CPAN mirror. To share files with the
general public, dromedary serves your ~/public_html/ as
http://users.perl5.git.perl.org/~yourlogin/</p>

<p>OVERVIEW OF THE REPOSITORY Once you have changed into
the repository directory, you can inspect it.</p>

<p>After a clone the repository will contain a single local
branch, which will be the current branch as well, as
indicated by the asterisk.</p>

<p>% git branch * blead</p>

<p>Using the -a switch to &quot;branch&quot; will also show
the remote tracking branches in the repository:</p>

<p>% git branch -a * blead origin/HEAD origin/blead ...</p>

<p>The branches that begin with &quot;origin&quot;
correspond to the &quot;git remote&quot; that you cloned
from (which is named &quot;origin&quot;). Each branch on the
remote will be exactly tracked by theses branches. You
should NEVER do work on these remote tracking branches. You
only ever do work in a local branch. Local branches can be
configured to automerge (on pull) from a designated remote
tracking branch. This is the case with the default branch
&quot;blead&quot; which will be configured to merge from the
remote tracking branch &quot;origin/blead&quot;.</p>

<p>You can see recent commits:</p>

<p>% git log</p>

<p>And pull new changes from the repository, and update
your local repository (must be clean first)</p>

<p>% git pull</p>

<p>Assuming we are on the branch &quot;blead&quot;
immediately after a pull, this command would be more or less
equivalent to:</p>

<p>% git fetch % git merge origin/blead</p>

<p>In fact if you want to update your local repository
without touching your working directory you do:</p>

<p>% git fetch</p>

<p>And if you want to update your remote-tracking branches
for all defined remotes simultaneously you can do</p>

<p>% git remote update</p>

<p>Neither of these last two commands will update your
working directory, however both will update the
remote-tracking branches in your repository.</p>

<p>To switch to another branch:</p>

<p>% git checkout origin/maint-5.8-dor</p>

<p>To make a local branch of a remote branch:</p>

<p>% git checkout -b maint-5.10 origin/maint-5.10</p>

<p>To switch back to blead:</p>

<p>% git checkout blead</p>

<p>FINDING OUT YOUR STATUS The most common git command you
will use will probably be</p>

<p>% git status</p>

<p>This command will produce as output a description of the
current state of the repository, including modified files
and unignored untracked files, and in addition it will show
things like what files have been staged for the next commit,
and usually some useful information about how to change
things. For instance the following:</p>

<p>$ git status # On branch blead # Your branch is ahead of
&rsquo;origin/blead&rsquo; by 1 commit. # # Changes to be
committed: # (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot;
to unstage) # # modified: pod/perlrepository.pod # # Changed
but not updated: # (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot;
to update what will be committed) # # modified:
pod/perlrepository.pod # # Untracked files: # (use &quot;git
add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be
committed) # # deliberate.untracked</p>

<p>This shows that there were changes to this document
staged for commit, and that there were further changes in
the working directory not yet staged. It also shows that
there was an untracked file in the working directory, and as
you can see shows how to change all of this. It also shows
that there is one commit on the working branch
&quot;blead&quot; which has not been pushed to the
&quot;origin&quot; remote yet. NOTE: that this output is
also what you see as a template if you do not provide a
message to &quot;git commit&quot;.</p>

<p>Assuming we commit all the mentioned changes above:</p>

<p>% git commit -a -m&rsquo;explain git status and stuff
about remotes&rsquo; Created commit daf8e63: explain git
status and stuff about remotes 1 files changed, 83
insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)</p>

<p>We can re-run git status and see something like
this:</p>

<p>% git status # On branch blead # Your branch is ahead of
&rsquo;origin/blead&rsquo; by 2 commits. # # Untracked
files: # (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include
in what will be committed) # # deliberate.untracked nothing
added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git
add&quot; to track)</p>

<p>When in doubt, before you do anything else, check your
status and read it carefully, many questions are answered
directly by the git status output.</p>

<p>SUBMITTING A PATCH If you have a patch in mind for Perl,
you should first get a copy of the repository:</p>

<p>% git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git
perl-git</p>

<p>Then change into the directory:</p>

<p>% cd perl-git</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you already have a Perl repository,
you should ensure that youre on the blead branch, and your
repository is up to date:</p>

<p>% git checkout blead % git pull</p>

<p>Its preferable to patch against the latest blead
version, since this is where new development occurs for all
changes other than critical bug fixes. Critical bug fix
patches should be made against the relevant maint branches,
or should be submitted with a note indicating all the
branches where the fix should be applied.</p>

<p>Now that we have everything up to date, we need to
create a temporary new branch for these changes and switch
into it:</p>

<p>% git checkout -b orange</p>

<p>which is the short form of</p>

<p>% git branch orange % git checkout orange</p>

<p>Then make your changes. For example, if Leon Brocard
changes his name to Orange Brocard, we should change his
name in the AUTHORS file:</p>

<p>% perl -pi -e &rsquo;s{Leon Brocard}{Orange
Brocard}&rsquo; AUTHORS</p>

<p>You can see what files are changed:</p>

<p>% git status # On branch orange # Changes to be
committed: # (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot;
to unstage) # # modified: AUTHORS #</p>

<p>And you can see the changes:</p>

<p>% git diff diff --git a/AUTHORS b/AUTHORS index

<p>Now you should create a patch file for all your local
changes:</p>

<p>% git format-patch origin

<p>You should now send an email to perl5-porters@perl.org
with a description of your changes, and include this patch
file as an attachment.</p>

<p>If you want to delete your temporary branch, you may do
so with:</p>

<p>% git checkout blead % git branch -d orange error: The
branch &rsquo;orange&rsquo; is not an ancestor of your
current HEAD. If you are sure you want to delete it, run
&rsquo;git branch -D orange&rsquo;. % git branch -D orange
Deleted branch orange.</p>

<p>A note on derived files Be aware that many files in the
distribution are derivative--avoid patching them, because
git wont see the changes to them, and the build process will
overwrite them. Patch the originals instead. Most utilities
(like perldoc) are in this category, i.e. patch
utils/perldoc.PL rather than utils/perldoc. Similarly, don t
create patches for files under $src_root/ext from their
copies found in $install_root/lib. If you are unsure about
the proper location of a file that may have gotten copied
while building the source distribution, consult the
&quot;MANIFEST&quot;.</p>

<p>A note on binary files Since the patch(1) utility cannot
deal with binary files, its important that you either avoid
the use of binary files in your patch, generate the files
dynamically, or that you encode any binary files using the
uupacktool.pl utility.</p>

<p>Assuming you needed to include a gzip-encoded file for a
modules test suite, you might do this as follows using the
uupacktool.pl utility:</p>

<p>$ perl uupacktool.pl -v -p -D lib/Some/Module/t/src/t.gz
Writing lib/Some/Module/t/src/t.gz into
lib/Some/Module/t/src/t.gz.packed</p>

<p>This will replace the &quot;t.gz&quot; file with an
encoded counterpart. During &quot;make test&quot;, before
any tests are run, perls Makefile will restore all the
&quot;.packed&quot; files mentioned in the MANIFEST to their
original name. This means that the test suite does not need
to be aware of this packing scheme and will not need to be
altered.</p>

<p>Getting your patch accepted The first thing you should
include with your patch is a description of the problem that
the patch corrects. If it is a code patch (rather than a
documentation patch) you should also include a small test
case that illustrates the bug (a patch to an existing test
file is preferred).</p>

<p>If you are submitting a code patch there are several
other things that you need to do.</p>

<p>Comments, Comments, Comments Be sure to adequately
comment your code. While commenting every line is
unnecessary, anything that takes advantage of side effects
of operators, that creates changes that will be felt outside
of the function being patched, or that others may find
confusing should be documented. If you are going to err, it
is better to err on the side of adding too many comments
than too few.</p>

<p>Style In general, please follow the particular style of
the code you are patching.</p>

<p>In particular, follow these general guidelines for
patching Perl sources:</p>

<p>8-wide tabs (no exceptions!) 4-wide indents for code,
2-wide indents for nested CPP #defines try hard not to
exceed 79-columns ANSI C prototypes uncuddled elses and
&quot;K&amp;R&quot; style for indenting control constructs
no C++ style (//) comments mark places that need to be
revisited with XXX (and revisit often!) opening brace lines
up with &quot;if&quot; when conditional spans multiple
lines; should be at end-of-line otherwise in function
definitions, name starts in column 0 (return value is on
previous line) single space after keywords that are followed
by parens, no space between function name and following
paren avoid assignments in conditionals, but if
they&rsquo;re unavoidable, use extra paren, e.g. &quot;if (a
&amp;&amp; (b = c)) ...&quot; &quot;return foo;&quot; rather
than &quot;return(foo);&quot; &quot;if (!foo) ...&quot;
rather than &quot;if (foo == FALSE) ...&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Testsuite When submitting a patch you should make every
effort to also include an addition to perl s regression
tests to properly exercise your patch. Your testsuite
additions should generally follow these guidelines (courtesy
of Gurusamy Sarathy &lt;gsar@activestate.com&gt;):</p>

<p>Know what you&rsquo;re testing. Read the docs, and the
source. Tend to fail, not succeed. Interpret results
strictly. Use unrelated features (this will flush out
bizarre interactions). Use non-standard idioms (otherwise
you are not testing TIMTOWTDI). Avoid using hardcoded test
numbers whenever possible (the EXPECTED/GOT found in
t/op/tie.t is much more maintainable, and gives better
failure reports). Give meaningful error messages when a test
fails. Avoid using qx// and system() unless you are testing
for them. If you do use them, make sure that you cover _all_
perl platforms. Unlink any temporary files you create.
Promote unforeseen warnings to errors with $SIG{__WARN__}.
Be sure to use the libraries and modules shipped with the
version being tested, not those that were already installed.
Add comments to the code explaining what you are testing
for. Make updating the &rsquo;1..42&rsquo; string
unnecessary. Or make sure that you update it. Test _all_
behaviors of a given operator, library, or function: - All
optional arguments - Return values in various contexts
(boolean, scalar, list, lvalue) - Use both global and
lexical variables - Don&rsquo;t forget the exceptional,
pathological cases.</p>

<p>ACCEPTING A PATCH If you have received a patch file
generated using the above section, you should try out the
patch.</p>

<p>First we need to create a temporary new branch for these
changes and switch into it:</p>

<p>% git checkout -b experimental</p>

<p>Patches that were formatted by &quot;git
format-patch&quot; are applied with &quot;git am&quot;:</p>

<p>% git am
0001-Rename-Leon-Brocard-to-Orange-Brocard.patch Applying
Rename Leon Brocard to Orange Brocard</p>

<p>If just a raw diff is provided, it is also possible use
this two-step process:</p>

<p>% git apply bugfix.diff % git commit -a -m &quot;Some
fixing&quot; --author=&quot;That Guy
&lt;that.guy@internets.com&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>Now we can inspect the change:</p>

<p>% git show HEAD commit
b1b3dab48344cff6de4087efca3dbd63548ab5e2 Author: Leon
Brocard &lt;acme@astray.com&gt; Date: Fri Dec 19 17:02:59

<p>Rename Leon Brocard to Orange Brocard</p>

<p>If you are a committer to Perl and you think the patch
is good, you can then merge it into blead then push it out
to the main repository:</p>

<p>% git checkout blead % git merge experimental % git
push</p>

<p>If you want to delete your temporary branch, you may do
so with:</p>

<p>% git checkout blead % git branch -d experimental error:
The branch &rsquo;experimental&rsquo; is not an ancestor of
your current HEAD. If you are sure you want to delete it,
run &rsquo;git branch -D experimental&rsquo;. % git branch
-D experimental Deleted branch experimental.</p>

<p>CLEANING A WORKING DIRECTORY The command &quot;git
clean&quot; can with varying arguments be used as a
replacement for &quot;make clean&quot;.</p>

<p>To reset your working directory to a pristine condition
you can do:</p>

<p>git clean -dxf</p>

<p>However, be aware this will delete ALL untracked
content. You can use</p>

<p>git clean -Xf</p>

<p>to remove all ignored untracked files, such as build and
test byproduct, but leave any manually created files
alone.</p>

<p>If you only want to cancel some uncommitted edits, you
can use &quot;git checkout&quot; and give it a list of files
to be reverted, or &quot;git checkout -f&quot; to revert
them all.</p>

<p>If you want to cancel one or several commits, you can
use &quot;git reset&quot;.</p>

<p>BISECTING &quot;git&quot; provides a built-in way to
determine, with a binary search in the history, which commit
should be blamed for introducing a given bug.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a script ~/testcase.pl that exits
with 0 when some behaviour is correct, and with 1 when its
faulty. We need an helper script that automates building
&quot;perl&quot; and running the testcase:</p>

<p>% cat ~/run #!/bin/sh git clean -dxf # If you can use
ccache, add -Dcc=ccache gcc -Dld=gcc to the Configure line
sh Configure -des -Dusedevel -Doptimize=&quot;-g&quot; test
-f config.sh || exit 125 # Correct makefile for newer GNU
gcc perl -ni -we &rsquo;print unless
/&lt;(?:built-in|command)/&rsquo; makefile x2p/makefile # if
you just need miniperl, replace test_prep with miniperl make
-j4 test_prep -x ./perl || exit 125 ./perl -Ilib
~/testcase.pl ret=$? git clean -dxf exit $ret</p>

<p>This script may return 125 to indicate that the
corresponding commit should be skipped. Otherwise, it
returns the status of ~/testcase.pl.</p>

<p>We first enter in bisect mode with:</p>

<p>% git bisect start</p>

<p>For example, if the bug is present on &quot;HEAD&quot;
but wasnt in 5.10.0, &quot;git&quot; will learn about this
when you enter:</p>

<p>% git bisect bad % git bisect good perl-5.10.0
Bisecting: 853 revisions left to test after this</p>

<p>This results in checking out the median commit between
&quot;HEAD&quot; and &quot;perl-5.10.0&quot;. We can then
run the bisecting process with:</p>

<p>% git bisect run ~/run</p>

<p>When the first bad commit is isolated, &quot;git
bisect&quot; will tell you so:</p>

<p>ca4cfd28534303b82a216cfe83a1c80cbc3b9dc5 is first bad
commit commit ca4cfd28534303b82a216cfe83a1c80cbc3b9dc5
Author: Dave Mitchell &lt;davem@fdisolutions.com&gt; Date:
Sat Feb 9 14:56:23 2008 +0000</p>

<p>[perl #49472] Attributes + Unknown Error ...</p>

<p>bisect run success</p>

<p>You can peek into the bisecting process with &quot;git
bisect log&quot; and &quot;git bisect visualize&quot;.
&quot;git bisect reset&quot; will get you out of bisect
mode.</p>

<p>Please note that the first &quot;good&quot; state must
be an ancestor of the first &quot;bad&quot; state. If you
want to search for the commit that solved some bug, you have
to negate your test case (i.e. exit with 1 if OK and 0 if
not) and still mark the lower bound as &quot;good&quot; and
the upper as &quot;bad&quot;. The &quot;first bad
commit&quot; has then to be understood as the &quot;first
commit where the bug is solved&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;git help bisect&quot; has much more information on
how you can tweak your binary searches.</p>

<p>SUBMITTING A PATCH VIA GITHUB GitHub is a website that
makes it easy to fork and publish projects with Git. First
you should set up a GitHub account and log in.</p>

<p>Perls git repository is mirrored on GitHub at this
page:</p>

<p>http://github.com/github/perl/tree/blead</p>

<p>Visit the page and click the &quot;fork&quot; button.
This clones the Perl git repository for you and provides you
with &quot;Your Clone URL&quot; from which you should
clone:</p>

<p>% git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/perl.git
perl-github</p>

<p>We shall make the same patch as above, creating a new
branch:</p>

<p>% cd perl-github % git remote add upstream
git://github.com/github/perl.git % git pull upstream blead %
git checkout -b orange % perl -pi -e &rsquo;s{Leon
Brocard}{Orange Brocard}&rsquo; AUTHORS % git commit -a -m
&rsquo;Rename Leon Brocard to Orange Brocard&rsquo; % git
push origin orange</p>

<p>The orange branch has been pushed to GitHub, so you
should now send an email to perl5-porters@perl.org with a
description of your changes and the following
information:</p>

<p>http://github.com/USERNAME/perl/tree/orange
git@github.com:USERNAME/perl.git branch orange</p>

<p>MERGING FROM A BRANCH VIA GITHUB If someone has provided
a branch via GitHub and you are a committer, you should use
the following in your perl-ssh directory:</p>

<p>% git remote add dandv git://github.com/dandv/perl.git %
git fetch</p>

<p>Now you can see the differences between the branch and
blead:</p>

<p>% git diff dandv/blead</p>

<p>And you can see the commits:</p>

<p>% git log dandv/blead</p>

<p>If you approve of a specific commit, you can cherry pick
it:</p>

<p>% git cherry-pick
3adac458cb1c1d41af47fc66e67b49c8dec2323f</p>

<p>Or you could just merge the whole branch if you like it
all:</p>

<p>% git merge dandv/blead</p>

<p>And then push back to the repository:</p>

<p>% git push</p>

<p>COMMITTING TO MAINTENANCE VERSIONS Maintenance versions
should only be altered to add critical bug fixes.</p>

<p>To commit to a maintenance version of perl, you need to
create a local tracking branch:</p>

<p>% git checkout --track -b maint-5.005
origin/maint-5.005</p>

<p>This creates a local branch named
&quot;maint-5.005&quot;, which tracks the remote branch
&quot;origin/maint-5.005&quot;. Then you can pull, commit,
merge and push as before.</p>

<p>You can also cherry-pick commits from blead and another
branch, by using the &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; command. It
is recommended to use the -x option to &quot;git
cherry-pick&quot; in order to record the SHA1 of the
original commit in the new commit message.</p>

help command&quot;.</p>
