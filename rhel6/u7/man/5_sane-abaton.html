<p>sane-abaton(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-abaton(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-abaton - SANE backend for Abaton flatbed
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-abaton library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
Abaton flatbed scanners. At present, only the Scan 300/GS
(8bit, 256 levels of gray) is fully supported, due to the
absence of programming information. The Scan 300/S (black
and white) is recognized, but support for it is
untested.</p>

<p>If you own a Abaton scanner other than the ones listed
above that works with this backend, or if you own an Abaton
scanner that does not work with this backend, please contact
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org with the model number, so
that arrangements can be made to include sup- port for it.
Have a look at http://www.sane-project.org/mail-
ing-lists.html concerning subscription to sane-devel.</p>

<p>Abaton is out of business, and these scanners are not
supported by Everex (the parent company of Abaton), nor is
there any programming information to be found. This driver
is therefore based on information obtained by running
Abatons scanning desk accessory under MacsBug and tracing
the MacOS SCSI Manager calls it made during image
acquisition.</p>

<p>However, the protocol is very similar to, though not
compatible with, the one used by the Apple scanners,
therefore, if this backend is ever extended to support the
other Abaton models (they also made a color flatbed
scanner), it may be possible to fill in some &quot;missing
pieces&quot; from the (quite detailed) Apple scanner
documentation.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the path-name for the special device
that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the
special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a
symlink to such a device. Under Linux, such a device name
takes a format such as /dev/sga or /dev/sg0, for example.
See sane-scsi(5) for details.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the abaton.conf file is a
list of device names that correspond to Abaton scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. See sane-scsi(5) on details of what consti- tutes a
valid device name.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/abaton.conf The backend configuration
file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-abaton.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-abaton.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_ABATON If the library was compiled with debug
support enabled, this environment variable controls the
debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 255 requests
all debug output to be printed. Smaller levels reduce
verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS There are a few known ones, and definitely some
unknown ones.</p>

<p>Scan area miscalculations For the sake of programmer
efficiency, this backend handles all measurements in
millimetres, and floors (rather than rounds) values to avoid
possible damage to the scanner mechanism. Therefore, it may
not be possible to scan to the extreme right or bottom edges
of the page.</p>

<p>Cancelling the scan This might not work correctly, or it
might abort the frontend. The former is more likely than the
latter.</p>

<p>If you have found something that you think is a bug,
please attempt to recreate it with the SANE_DEBUG_ABATON
environment variable set to 255, and send a report detailing
the conditions surrounding the bug to
sane-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.</p>

<p>TODO Implement non-blocking support</p>

<p>Finish reverse-engineering the MacOS driver This will
allow me to add support for other models with reason- able
confidence that it will work, as well as to fully exploit
the information returned by the INQUIRY command.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The sane-abaton backend was partially written by
David Huggins-Daines, based on the sane-apple backend by
Milon Firikis.</p>
