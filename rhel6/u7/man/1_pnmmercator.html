<p>NAME pnmmercator - transform a worldmap from rectangular
projection to Mer- cator projection and vice-versa</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmmercator [-inverse] [-nomix] [-[v]verbose]
[filename]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>The pnmmercator utility, converts a rectangular
projection worldmap to a Mercator projection format, as used
for maps.google.com and many other online maps. The map used
as input for pnmmercator must have rows for -90 to 90
degrees latitude and columns for -180 to +180 degrees
longitude. The file will typically be twice as wide as high,
but this is not a requirement. The output file will be using
the Merca- tor projection and will get double the height of
the input file.</p>

<p>Maps using the Mercator projection are stretched more
the closer a row is to the North or South Pole. The last few
degrees (&gt; 85 or &lt; -85 degrees) are not part of a
Mercator map at all because they would be stretched too much
and the rows close to the edge will show banding, because
they originate from the same row in the original map.</p>

<p>To overcome this, the program will by default do
interpolation of pixel colors, which will eliminate the
banding effect, but will cause some blurring of the output.
With the -nomix option, this interpolation of colors isnt
applied. You can obtain the highest quality output by
starting with an input map of high resolution, so that you
can follow the pnmmercator transformation with a pamscale
reduction in size.</p>

<p>This program can also convert a Mercator projection map
back to a rect- angular projection based. As said, the
Mercator map doesnt have information about the latitudes
close to the poles. Therefore the top rows in the output
image will be identical and copied from the row cor-
responding with latitude of 85 degrees. The same at the
bottom of the map.</p>

<p>Pnmmercator doesnt have any provision for scaling the
image. You can scale by piping the output of the program
through Netpbm programs such as pamscale.</p>

<p>You can find maps to be used as input at
flatplanet.sourceforge.net(1) or uic.edu/pape .</p>

<p>The point of a Mercator projection map is that compass
directions work on it. If you draw a straight line northeast
from some point on the Mercator map, the line traces the
course you would sail if you sailed a compass bearing of
northeast from that spot. Naturally, primitive nav- igators
appreciated that. The biggest drawback of Mercator is that
areas to the north and south appear much larger than they
are in real life. For example, Greenland appears to be
larger than South America even though it only a ninth as
large. Note that areas away from the equator are stretched
north-south as well as east-west.</p>

<p>A rectangular projection is one where vertical distance
is proportional to angular latitude distance of the
represented area and horizontal distance is proportional to
angular longitude.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS filename is the name of the input file. If
you dont specify this, pnmmercator reads the image from
standard Input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;dl compact=&quot;compact&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>-inverse</p>

<p>With this option a conversion from Mercator to degrees
is applied.The output image will have half the height of the
input map.</p>

<p>-nomix</p>

<p>Default behaviour is that color blending is applied in
between two adjacent rows. If you specify the -nomix
parameter there is no blending. The consequence is a banding
at the top and bottom of the map. With this option, the
output map will also consist of exactly the same colors as
the input.</p>

<p>-verbose and -vverbose</p>

<p>This parameter outputs some additional information. If
you dou- ble the v , it will output debug data about the
lat/long degree and Mercator conversions.</p>

<p>HISTORY pnmmercator was new in Netpbm 10.49 (December
2009).</p>

<p>AUTHORS Willem van Schaik (of pnmtopng/pngtopnm fame)
wrote this program in October 2009 and suggested it for
inclusion in Netpbm.</p>
