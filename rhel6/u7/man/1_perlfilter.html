<p>NAME perlfilter - Source Filters</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This article is about a little-known feature
of Perl called source filters. Source filters alter the
program text of a module before Perl sees it, much as a C
preprocessor alters the source text of a C program before
the compiler sees it. This article tells you more about what
source filters are, how they work, and how to write your
own.</p>

<p>The original purpose of source filters was to let you
encrypt your program source to prevent casual piracy. This
isn t all they can do, as youll soon learn. But first, the
basics.</p>

<p>CONCEPTS Before the Perl interpreter can execute a Perl
script, it must first read it from a file into memory for
parsing and compilation. If that script itself includes
other scripts with a &quot;use&quot; or &quot;require&quot;
statement, then each of those scripts will have to be read
from their respective files as well.</p>

<p>Now think of each logical connection between the Perl
parser and an individual file as a source stream. A source
stream is created when the Perl parser opens a file, it
continues to exist as the source code is read into memory,
and it is destroyed when Perl is finished parsing the file.
If the parser encounters a &quot;require&quot; or
&quot;use&quot; statement in a source stream, a new and
distinct stream is created just for that file.</p>

<p>The diagram below represents a single source stream,
with the flow of source from a Perl script file on the left
into the Perl parser on the right. This is how Perl normally
operates.</p>

<p>file -------&gt; parser</p>

<p>There are two important points to remember:</p>

<p>1. Although there can be any number of source streams in
existence at any given time, only one will be active.</p>

<p>2. Every source stream is associated with only one
file.</p>

<p>A source filter is a special kind of Perl module that
intercepts and modifies a source stream before it reaches
the parser. A source filter changes our diagram like
this:</p>

<p>file ----&gt; filter ----&gt; parser</p>

<p>If that doesnt make much sense, consider the analogy of
a command pipeline. Say you have a shell script stored in
the compressed file trial.gz. The simple pipeline command
below runs the script without needing to create a temporary
file to hold the uncompressed file.</p>

<p>gunzip -c trial.gz | sh</p>

<p>In this case, the data flow from the pipeline can be
represented as follows:</p>

<p>trial.gz ----&gt; gunzip ----&gt; sh</p>

<p>With source filters, you can store the text of your
script compressed and use a source filter to uncompress it
for Perls parser:</p>

<p>compressed gunzip Perl program ---&gt; source filter
---&gt; parser</p>

<p>USING FILTERS So how do you use a source filter in a
Perl script? Above, I said that a source filter is just a
special kind of module. Like all Perl modules, a source
filter is invoked with a use statement.</p>

<p>Say you want to pass your Perl source through the C
preprocessor before execution. You could use the existing
&quot;-P&quot; command line option to do this, but as it
happens, the source filters distribution comes with a C
preprocessor filter module called Filter::cpp. Let s use
that instead.</p>

<p>Below is an example program, &quot;cpp_test&quot;, which
makes use of this filter. Line numbers have been added to
allow specific lines to be referenced easily.</p>

<p>1: use Filter::cpp; 2: #define TRUE 1 3: $a = TRUE; 4:
print &quot;a = $a0;</p>

<p>When you execute this script, Perl creates a source
stream for the file. Before the parser processes any of the
lines from the file, the source stream looks like this:</p>

<p>cpp_test ---------&gt; parser</p>

<p>Line 1, &quot;use Filter::cpp&quot;, includes and
installs the &quot;cpp&quot; filter module. All source
filters work this way. The use statement is compiled and
executed at compile time, before any more of the file is
read, and it attaches the cpp filter to the source stream
behind the scenes. Now the data flow looks like this:</p>

<p>cpp_test ----&gt; cpp filter ----&gt; parser</p>

<p>As the parser reads the second and subsequent lines from
the source stream, it feeds those lines through the
&quot;cpp&quot; source filter before processing them. The
&quot;cpp&quot; filter simply passes each line through the
real C preprocessor. The output from the C preprocessor is
then inserted back into the source stream by the filter.</p>

<p>.-&gt; cpp --. | | | | | &lt;-&rsquo; cpp_test ----&gt;
cpp filter ----&gt; parser</p>

<p>The parser then sees the following code:</p>

<p>use Filter::cpp; $a = 1; print &quot;a = $a0;</p>

<p>Lets consider what happens when the filtered code
includes another module with use:</p>

<p>1: use Filter::cpp; 2: #define TRUE 1 3: use Fred; 4: $a
= TRUE; 5: print &quot;a = $a0;</p>

<p>The &quot;cpp&quot; filter does not apply to the text of
the Fred module, only to the text of the file that used it
(&quot;cpp_test&quot;). Although the use statement on line 3
will pass through the cpp filter, the module that gets
included (&quot;Fred&quot;) will not. The source streams
look like this after line 3 has been parsed and before line
4 is parsed:</p>

<p>cpp_test ---&gt; cpp filter ---&gt; parser
(INACTIVE)</p>

<p>Fred.pm ----&gt; parser</p>

<p>As you can see, a new stream has been created for
reading the source from &quot;Fred.pm&quot;. This stream
will remain active until all of &quot;Fred.pm&quot; has been
parsed. The source stream for &quot;cpp_test&quot; will
still exist, but is inactive. Once the parser has finished
reading Fred.pm, the source stream associated with it will
be destroyed. The source stream for &quot;cpp_test&quot;
then becomes active again and the parser reads line 4 and
subsequent lines from &quot;cpp_test&quot;.</p>

<p>You can use more than one source filter on a single
file. Similarly, you can reuse the same filter in as many
files as you like.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a uuencoded and compressed
source file, it is possible to stack a uudecode filter and
an uncompression filter like this:</p>

<p>use Filter::uudecode; use Filter::uncompress;
M&rsquo;XL(&quot;.H&lt;US4&rsquo;&rsquo;V9I;F%L&rsquo;)Q;&gt;7/;1I;_&gt;_I3=&amp;E=%:F*I&quot;T?22Q/
M6]9*&lt;IQCO*XFT&quot;0[PL%%&rsquo;Y+IG?WN^ZYN-$&rsquo;J.[.JE$,20/?K=_[&gt;
...</p>

<p>Once the first line has been processed, the flow will
look like this:</p>

<p>file ---&gt; uudecode ---&gt; uncompress ---&gt; parser
filter filter</p>

<p>Data flows through filters in the same order they appear
in the source file. The uudecode filter appeared before the
uncompress filter, so the source file will be uudecoded
before its uncompressed.</p>

<p>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER There are three ways to write
your own source filter. You can write it in C, use an
external program as a filter, or write the filter in Perl. I
wont cover the first two in any great detail, so Ill get
them out of the way first. Writing the filter in Perl is
most convenient, so Ill devote the most space to it.</p>

<p>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C The first of the three
available techniques is to write the filter completely in C.
The external module you create interfaces directly with the
source filter hooks provided by Perl.</p>

<p>The advantage of this technique is that you have
complete control over the implementation of your filter. The
big disadvantage is the increased complexity required to
write the filter - not only do you need to understand the
source filter hooks, but you also need a reasonable
knowledge of Perl guts. One of the few times it is worth
going to this trouble is when writing a source scrambler.
The &quot;decrypt&quot; filter (which unscrambles the source
before Perl parses it) included with the source filter
distribution is an example of a C source filter (see
Decryption Filters, below).</p>

<p>Decryption Filters All decryption filters work on the
principle of &quot;security through obscurity.&quot;
Regardless of how well you write a decryption filter and how
strong your encryption algorithm is, anyone determined
enough can retrieve the original source code. The reason is
quite simple - once the decryption filter has decrypted the
source back to its original form, fragments of it will be
stored in the computer s memory as Perl parses it. The
source might only be in memory for a short period of time,
but anyone possessing a debugger, skill, and lots of
patience can eventually reconstruct your program.</p>

<p>That said, there are a number of steps that can be taken
to make life difficult for the potential cracker. The most
important: Write your decryption filter in C and statically
link the decryption module into the Perl binary. For further
tips to make life difficult for the potential cracker, see
the file decrypt.pm in the source filters module.</p>

<p>CREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A SEPARATE EXECUTABLE An
alternative to writing the filter in C is to create a
separate executable in the language of your choice. The
separate executable reads from standard input, does whatever
processing is necessary, and writes the filtered data to
standard output. &quot;Filter::cpp&quot; is an example of a
source filter implemented as a separate executable - the
executable is the C preprocessor bundled with your C
compiler.</p>

<p>The source filter distribution includes two modules that
simplify this task: &quot;Filter::exec&quot; and
&quot;Filter::sh&quot;. Both allow you to run any external
executable. Both use a coprocess to control the flow of data
into and out of the external executable. (For details on
coprocesses, see Stephens, W.R. &quot;Advanced Programming
in the UNIX Environment.&quot; Addison-Wesley, ISBN
0-210-56317-7, pages 441-445.) The difference between them
is that &quot;Filter::exec&quot; spawns the external command
directly, while &quot;Filter::sh&quot; spawns a shell to
execute the external command. (Unix uses the Bourne shell;
NT uses the cmd shell.) Spawning a shell allows you to make
use of the shell metacharacters and redirection
facilities.</p>

<p>Here is an example script that uses
&quot;Filter::sh&quot;:</p>

<p>use Filter::sh &rsquo;tr XYZ PQR&rsquo;; $a = 1; print
&quot;XYZ a = $a0;</p>

<p>The output youll get when the script is executed:</p>

<p>PQR a = 1</p>

<p>Writing a source filter as a separate executable works
fine, but a small performance penalty is incurred. For
example, if you execute the small example above, a separate
subprocess will be created to run the Unix &quot;tr&quot;
command. Each use of the filter requires its own subprocess.
If creating subprocesses is expensive on your system, you
might want to consider one of the other options for creating
source filters.</p>

<p>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL The easiest and most
portable option available for creating your own source
filter is to write it completely in Perl. To distinguish
this from the previous two techniques, I ll call it a Perl
source filter.</p>

<p>To help understand how to write a Perl source filter we
need an example to study. Here is a complete source filter
that performs rot13 decoding. (Rot13 is a very simple
encryption scheme used in Usenet postings to hide the
contents of offensive posts. It moves every letter forward
thirteen places, so that A becomes N, B becomes O, and Z
becomes M.)</p>

<p>package Rot13;</p>

<p>use Filter::Util::Call;</p>

<p>sub import { my ($type) = @_; my ($ref) = [];
filter_add(bless $ref); }</p>

<p>sub filter { my ($self) = @_; my ($status);</p>

<p>tr/n-za-mN-ZA-M/a-zA-Z/ if ($status = filter_read())
&gt; 0; $status; }</p>

<p>1;</p>

<p>All Perl source filters are implemented as Perl classes
and have the same basic structure as the example above.</p>

<p>First, we include the &quot;Filter::Util::Call&quot;
module, which exports a number of functions into your filter
s namespace. The filter shown above uses two of these
functions, &quot;filter_add()&quot; and
&quot;filter_read()&quot;.</p>

<p>Next, we create the filter object and associate it with
the source stream by defining the &quot;import&quot;
function. If you know Perl well enough, you know that
&quot;import&quot; is called automatically every time a
module is included with a use statement. This makes
&quot;import&quot; the ideal place to both create and
install a filter object.</p>

<p>In the example filter, the object ($ref) is blessed just
like any other Perl object. Our example uses an anonymous
array, but this isnt a requirement. Because this example
doesnt need to store any context information, we could have
used a scalar or hash reference just as well. The next
section demonstrates context data.</p>

<p>The association between the filter object and the source
stream is made with the &quot;filter_add()&quot; function.
This takes a filter object as a parameter ($ref in this
case) and installs it in the source stream.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the code that actually does the
filtering. For this type of Perl source filter, all the
filtering is done in a method called &quot;filter()&quot;.
(It is also possible to write a Perl source filter using a
closure. See the &quot;Filter::Util::Call&quot; manual page
for more details.) Its called every time the Perl parser
needs another line of source to process. The
&quot;filter()&quot; method, in turn, reads lines from the
source stream using the &quot;filter_read()&quot;
function.</p>

<p>If a line was available from the source stream,
&quot;filter_read()&quot; returns a status value greater
than zero and appends the line to $_. A status value of zero
indicates end-of-file, less than zero means an error. The
filter function itself is expected to return its status in
the same way, and put the filtered line it wants written to
the source stream in $_. The use of $_ accounts for the
brevity of most Perl source filters.</p>

<p>In order to make use of the rot13 filter we need some
way of encoding the source file in rot13 format. The script
below, &quot;mkrot13&quot;, does just that.</p>

<p>die &quot;usage mkrot13 filename0 unless @ARGV; my $in =
$ARGV[0]; my $out = &quot;$in.tmp&quot;; open(IN,
&quot;&lt;$in&quot;) or die &quot;Cannot open file $in: $!0;
open(OUT, &quot;&gt;$out&quot;) or die &quot;Cannot open
file $out: $!0;</p>

<p>print OUT &quot;use Rot13;0; while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
tr/a-zA-Z/n-za-mN-ZA-M/; print OUT; }</p>

<p>close IN; close OUT; unlink $in; rename $out, $in;</p>

<p>If we encrypt this with &quot;mkrot13&quot;:</p>

<p>print &quot; hello fred 0;</p>

<p>the result will be this:</p>

<p>use Rot13; cevag &quot;uryyb serq&quot;;</p>

<p>Running it produces this output:</p>

<p>hello fred</p>

<p>USING CONTEXT: THE DEBUG FILTER The rot13 example was a
trivial example. Heres another demonstration that shows off
a few more features.</p>

<p>Say you wanted to include a lot of debugging code in
your Perl script during development, but you didnt want it
available in the released product. Source filters offer a
solution. In order to keep the example simple, let s say you
wanted the debugging output to be controlled by an
environment variable, &quot;DEBUG&quot;. Debugging code is
enabled if the variable exists, otherwise it is
disabled.</p>

<p>Two special marker lines will bracket debugging code,
like this:</p>

<p>## DEBUG_BEGIN if ($year &gt; 1999) { warn &quot;Debug:
millennium bug in year $year0; } ## DEBUG_END</p>

<p>When the &quot;DEBUG&quot; environment variable exists,
the filter ensures that Perl parses only the code between
the &quot;DEBUG_BEGIN&quot; and &quot;DEBUG_END&quot;
markers. That means that when &quot;DEBUG&quot; does exist,
the code above should be passed through the filter
unchanged. The marker lines can also be passed through
as-is, because the Perl parser will see them as comment
lines. When &quot;DEBUG&quot; isnt set, we need a way to
disable the debug code. A simple way to achieve that is to
convert the lines between the two markers into comments:</p>

<p>## DEBUG_BEGIN #if ($year &gt; 1999) { # warn
&quot;Debug: millennium bug in year $year0; #} ##
DEBUG_END</p>

<p>Here is the complete Debug filter:</p>

<p>package Debug;</p>

<p>use strict; use warnings; use Filter::Util::Call;</p>

<p>use constant TRUE =&gt; 1; use constant FALSE =&gt;
0;</p>

<p>sub import { my ($type) = @_; my (%context) = ( Enabled
=&gt; defined $ENV{DEBUG}, InTraceBlock =&gt; FALSE,
Filename =&gt; (caller)[1], LineNo =&gt; 0, LastBegin =&gt;
0, ); filter_add(bless context); }</p>

<p>sub Die { my ($self) = shift; my ($message) = shift; my
($line_no) = shift || $self-&gt;{LastBegin}; die
&quot;$message at $self-&gt;{Filename} line $line_no.0 }</p>

<p>sub filter { my ($self) = @_; my ($status); $status =
filter_read(); ++ $self-&gt;{LineNo};</p>

<p># deal with EOF/error first if ($status &lt;= 0) {
$self-&gt;Die(&quot;DEBUG_BEGIN has no DEBUG_END&quot;) if
$self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}; return $status; }</p>

<p>if ($self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}) { if (/^##DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) {
$self-&gt;Die(&quot;Nested DEBUG_BEGIN&quot;,
$self-&gt;{LineNo}) } elsif (/^##DEBUG_END/) {
$self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE; }</p>

<p># comment out the debug lines when the filter is
disabled s/^/#/ if ! $self-&gt;{Enabled}; } elsif (
/^##DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) { $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE;
$self-&gt;{LastBegin} = $self-&gt;{LineNo}; } elsif (
/^##DEBUG_END/ ) { $self-&gt;Die(&quot;DEBUG_END has no
DEBUG_BEGIN&quot;, $self-&gt;{LineNo}); } return $status;
}</p>

<p>1;</p>

<p>The big difference between this filter and the previous
example is the use of context data in the filter object. The
filter object is based on a hash reference, and is used to
keep various pieces of context information between calls to
the filter function. All but two of the hash fields are used
for error reporting. The first of those two, Enabled, is
used by the filter to determine whether the debugging code
should be given to the Perl parser. The second,
InTraceBlock, is true when the filter has encountered a
&quot;DEBUG_BEGIN&quot; line, but has not yet encountered
the following &quot;DEBUG_END&quot; line.</p>

<p>If you ignore all the error checking that most of the
code does, the essence of the filter is as follows:</p>

<p>sub filter { my ($self) = @_; my ($status); $status =
filter_read();</p>

<p># deal with EOF/error first return $status if $status
&lt;= 0; if ($self-&gt;{InTraceBlock}) { if (/^##DEBUG_END/)
{ $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE }</p>

<p># comment out debug lines when the filter is disabled
s/^/#/ if ! $self-&gt;{Enabled}; } elsif ( /^##DEBUG_BEGIN/
) { $self-&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE; } return $status; }</p>

<p>Be warned: just as the C-preprocessor doesnt know C, the
Debug filter doesnt know Perl. It can be fooled quite
easily:</p>

<p>print &lt;&lt;EOM; ##DEBUG_BEGIN EOM</p>

<p>Such things aside, you can see that a lot can be
achieved with a modest amount of code.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION You now have better understanding of what a
source filter is, and you might even have a possible use for
them. If you feel like playing with source filters but need
a bit of inspiration, here are some extra features you could
add to the Debug filter.</p>

<p>First, an easy one. Rather than having debugging code
that is all-or- nothing, it would be much more useful to be
able to control which specific blocks of debugging code get
included. Try extending the syntax for debug blocks to allow
each to be identified. The contents of the &quot;DEBUG&quot;
environment variable can then be used to control which
blocks get included.</p>

<p>Once you can identify individual blocks, try allowing
them to be nested. That isnt difficult either.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting idea that doesnt involve the
Debug filter. Currently Perl subroutines have fairly limited
support for formal parameter lists. You can specify the
number of parameters and their type, but you still have to
manually take them out of the @_ array yourself. Write a
source filter that allows you to have a named parameter
list. Such a filter would turn this:</p>

<p>sub MySub ($first, $second, @rest) { ... }</p>

<p>into this:</p>

<p>sub MySub($$@) { my ($first) = shift; my ($second) =
shift; my (@rest) = @_; ... }</p>

<p>Finally, if you feel like a real challenge, have a go at
writing a full-blown Perl macro preprocessor as a source
filter. Borrow the useful features from the C preprocessor
and any other macro processors you know. The tricky bit will
be choosing how much knowledge of Perls syntax you want your
filter to have.</p>

<p>THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR Some Filters Clobber the
&quot;DATA&quot; Handle Some source filters use the
&quot;DATA&quot; handle to read the calling program. When
using these source filters you cannot rely on this handle,
nor expect any particular kind of behavior when operating on
it. Filters based on Filter::Util::Call (and therefore
Filter::Simple) do not alter the &quot;DATA&quot;
filehandle.</p>

<p>REQUIREMENTS The Source Filters distribution is
available on CPAN, in</p>

<p>CPAN/modules/by-module/Filter</p>

<p>Starting from Perl 5.8 Filter::Util::Call (the core part
of the Source Filters distribution) is part of the standard
Perl distribution. Also included is a friendlier interface
called Filter::Simple, by Damian Conway.</p>
