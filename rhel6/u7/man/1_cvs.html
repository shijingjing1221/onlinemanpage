<p>NAME cvs - Concurrent Versions System</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [
command_options ] [ command_args ]</p>

<p>NOTE This manpage is a summary of some of the features
of cvs. It is auto- generated from an appendix of the CVS
manual. For more in-depth docu- mentation, please consult
the Cederqvist manual (via the info CVS com- mand or
otherwise, as described in the SEE ALSO section of this man-
page). Cross-references in this man page refer to nodes in
the same.</p>

<p>CVS commands Guide to CVS commands This appendix
describes the overall structure of cvs commands, and
describes some commands in detail (others are described
elsewhere; for a quick reference to cvs commands, see node
Invoking CVS&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>Structure Overall structure of CVS commands The overall
format of all cvs commands is:</p>

<p>cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [
command_args ]</p>

<p>cvs</p>

<p>The name of the cvs program.</p>

<p>cvs_options</p>

<p>Some options that affect all sub-commands of cvs. These
are described below.</p>

<p>cvs_command</p>

<p>One of several different sub-commands. Some of the
commands have aliases that can be used instead; those
aliases are noted in the ref- erence manual for that
command. There are only two situations where you may omit
cvs_command: cvs -H elicits a list of available com- mands,
and cvs -v displays version information on cvs itself.</p>

<p>command_options</p>

<p>Options that are specific for the command.</p>

<p>command_args</p>

<p>Arguments to the commands.</p>

<p>There is unfortunately some confusion between
cvs_options and com- mand_options. When given as a
cvs_option, some options only affect some of the commands.
When given as a command_option it may have a different
meaning, and be accepted by more commands. In other words,
do not take the above categorization too seriously. Look at
the doc- umentation instead.</p>

<p>Exit status CVS&rsquo;s exit status cvs can indicate to
the calling environment whether it succeeded or failed by
setting its exit status. The exact way of testing the exit
status will vary from one operating system to another. For
example in a unix shell script the $? variable will be 0 if
the last command returned a successful exit status, or
greater than 0 if the exit status indicated failure.</p>

<p>If cvs is successful, it returns a successful status; if
there is an error, it prints an error message and returns a
failure status. The one exception to this is the cvs diff
command. It will return a suc- cessful status if it found no
differences, or a failure status if there were differences
or if there was an error. Because this behavior pro- vides
no good way to detect errors, in the future it is possible
that cvs diff will be changed to behave like the other cvs
commands.</p>

<p>~/.cvsrc Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file There are
some command_options that are used so often that you might
have set up an alias or some other means to make sure you
always spec- ify that option. One example (the one that
drove the implementation of the .cvsrc support, actually) is
that many people find the default out- put of the diff
command to be very hard to read, and that either con- text
diffs or unidiffs are much easier to understand.</p>

<p>The ~/.cvsrc file is a way that you can add default
options to cvs_com- mands within cvs, instead of relying on
aliases or other shell scripts.</p>

<p>The format of the ~/.cvsrc file is simple. The file is
searched for a line that begins with the same name as the
cvs_command being executed. If a match is found, then the
remainder of the line is split up (at whitespace characters)
into separate options and added to the command arguments
before any options from the command line.</p>

<p>If a command has two names (e.g., checkout and co), the
official name, not necessarily the one used on the command
line, will be used to match against the file. So if this is
the contents of the user&rsquo;s ~/.cvsrc file:</p>

<p>log -N diff -uN rdiff -u update -Pd checkout -P release
-d</p>

<p>the command cvs checkout foo would have the -P option
added to the arguments, as well as cvs co foo.</p>

<p>With the example file above, the output from cvs diff
foobar will be in unidiff format. cvs diff -c foobar will
provide context diffs, as usual. Getting &quot;old&quot;
format diffs would be slightly more complicated, because
diff doesn&rsquo;t have an option to specify use of the
&quot;old&quot; format, so you would need cvs -f diff
foobar.</p>

<p>In place of the command name you can use cvs to specify
global options (see node Global options&rsquo; in the CVS
manual). For example the follow- ing line in .cvsrc</p>

<p>cvs -z6</p>

<p>causes cvs to use compression level 6.</p>

<p>Global options The available cvs_options (that are given
to the left of cvs_command) are:</p>

<p>--allow-root=rootdir</p>

<p>Specify legal cvsroot directory. See Password
authentication server&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-a</p>

<p>Authenticate all communication between the client and
the server. Only has an effect on the cvs client. As of this
writing, this is only implemented when using a GSSAPI
connection (see node GSSAPI authenticated&rsquo; in the CVS
manual). Authentication prevents certain sorts of attacks
involving hijacking the active tcp connection. Enabling
authentication does not enable encryption.</p>

<p>-b bindir</p>

<p>In cvs 1.9.18 and older, this specified that rcs
programs are in the bindir directory. Current versions of
cvs do not run rcs programs; for compatibility this option
is accepted, but it does nothing.</p>

<p>-T tempdir</p>

<p>Use tempdir as the directory where temporary files are
located. Overrides the setting of the $TMPDIR environment
variable and any precompiled directory. This parameter
should be specified as an absolute pathname. (When running
client/server, -T affects only the local process; specifying
-T for the client has no effect on the server and vice
versa.)</p>

<p>-d cvs_root_directory</p>

<p>Use cvs_root_directory as the root directory pathname of
the reposi- tory. Overrides the setting of the $CVSROOT
environment variable. See Repository&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>-e editor</p>

<p>Use editor to enter revision log information. Overrides
the setting of the $CVSEDITOR and $EDITOR environment
variables. For more infor- mation, see Committing your
changes&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>Do not read the ~/.cvsrc file. This option is most often
used because of the non-orthogonality of the cvs option set.
For example, the cvs log option -N (turn off display of tag
names) does not have a corresponding option to turn the
display on. So if you have -N in the ~/.cvsrc entry for log,
you may need to use -f to show the tag names.</p>

<p>-H</p>

<p>--help</p>

<p>Display usage information about the specified
cvs_command (but do not actually execute the command). If
you don&rsquo;t specify a command name, cvs -H displays
overall help for cvs, including a list of other help
options.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>Do not change any files. Attempt to execute the
cvs_command, but only to issue reports; do not remove,
update, or merge any existing files, or create any new
files.</p>

<p>Note that cvs will not necessarily produce exactly the
same output as without -n. In some cases the output will be
the same, but in other cases cvs will skip some of the
processing that would have been required to produce the
exact same output.</p>

<p>-Q</p>

<p>Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will
only generate output for serious problems.</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational
messages, such as reports of recursion through
subdirectories, are suppressed.</p>

<p>-r</p>

<p>Make new working files read-only. Same effect as if the
$CVSREAD environment variable is set (see node Environment
variables&rsquo; in the CVS manual). The default is to make
working files writable, unless watches are on (see node
Watches&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>-s variable=value</p>

<p>Set a user variable (see node Variables&rsquo; in the
CVS manual).</p>

<p>-t</p>

<p>Trace program execution; display messages showing the
steps of cvs activity. Particularly useful with -n to
explore the potential impact of an unfamiliar command.</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--version</p>

<p>Display version and copyright information for cvs.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>Make new working files read-write. Overrides the setting
of the $CVSREAD environment variable. Files are created
read-write by default, unless $CVSREAD is set or -r is
given.</p>

<p>-x</p>

<p>Encrypt all communication between the client and the
server. Only has an effect on the cvs client. As of this
writing, this is only implemented when using a GSSAPI
connection (see node GSSAPI authen- ticated&rsquo; in the
CVS manual) or a Kerberos connection (see node Ker- beros
authenticated&rsquo; in the CVS manual). Enabling encryption
implies that message traffic is also authenticated.
Encryption support is not available by default; it must be
enabled using a special config- ure option,
--enable-encryption, when you build cvs.</p>

<p>-z gzip-level</p>

<p>Set the compression level. Valid levels are 1 (high
speed, low com- pression) to 9 (low speed, high
compression), or 0 to disable com- pression (the default).
Only has an effect on the cvs client.</p>

<p>Common options Common command options This section
describes the command_options that are available across
several cvs commands. These options are always given to the
right of cvs_command. Not all commands support all of these
options; each option is only supported for commands where it
makes sense. However, when a command has one of these
options you can almost always count on the same behavior of
the option as in other commands. (Other command options,
which are listed with the individual commands, may have dif-
ferent behavior from one cvs command to the other).</p>

<p>The history command is an exception; it supports many
options that con- flict even with these standard
options.</p>

<p>-D date_spec</p>

<p>Use the most recent revision no later than date_spec.
date_spec is a single argument, a date description
specifying a date in the past.</p>

<p>The specification is sticky when you use it to make a
private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a
working file using -D, cvs records the date you specified,
so that further updates in the same directory will use the
same date (for more information on sticky tags/dates, see
node Sticky tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>-D is available with the annotate, checkout, diff,
export, history, rdiff, rtag, and update commands. (The
history command uses this option in a slightly different
way; see node history options&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>A wide variety of date formats are supported by cvs. The
most stan- dard ones are ISO8601 (from the International
Standards Organization) and the Internet e-mail standard
(specified in RFC822 as amended by RFC1123).</p>

<p>ISO8601 dates have many variants but a few examples
are:</p>

<p>1972-09-24 1972-09-24 20:05</p>

<p>There are a lot more ISO8601 date formats, and cvs
accepts many of them, but you probably don&rsquo;t want to
hear the whole long story :-).</p>

<p>In addition to the dates allowed in Internet e-mail
itself, cvs also allows some of the fields to be omitted.
For example:</p>

<p>24 Sep 1972 20:05 24 Sep</p>

<p>The date is interpreted as being in the local timezone,
unless a spe- cific timezone is specified.</p>

<p>These two date formats are preferred. However, cvs
currently accepts a wide variety of other date formats. They
are intentionally not documented here in any detail, and
future versions of cvs might not accept all of them.</p>

<p>One such format is month/day/year. This may confuse
people who are accustomed to having the month and day in the
other order; 1/4/96 is January 4, not April 1.</p>

<p>Remember to quote the argument to the -D flag so that
your shell doesn&rsquo;t interpret spaces as argument
separators. A command using the -D flag can look like
this:</p>

<p>$ cvs diff -D &quot;1 hour ago&quot; cvs.texinfo</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>When you specify a particular date or tag to cvs
commands, they nor- mally ignore files that do not contain
the tag (or did not exist prior to the date) that you
specified. Use the -f option if you want files retrieved
even when there is no match for the tag or date. (The most
recent revision of the file will be used).</p>

<p>Note that even with -f, a tag that you specify must
exist (that is, in some file, not necessary in every file).
This is so that cvs will continue to give an error if you
mistype a tag name.</p>

<p>-f is available with these commands: annotate, checkout,
export, rdiff, rtag, and update.</p>

<p>WARNING: The commit and remove commands also have a -f
option, but it has a different behavior for those commands.
See commit options&rsquo; in the CVS manual, andRemoving
files&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-k kflag</p>

<p>Alter the default processing of keywords. See Keyword
substitution&rsquo; in the CVS manual, for the meaning of
kflag. Your kflag specifica- tion is sticky when you use it
to create a private copy of a source file; that is, when you
use this option with the checkout or update commands, cvs
associates your selected kflag with the file, and con-
tinues to use it with future update commands on the same
file until you specify otherwise.</p>

<p>The -k option is available with the add, checkout, diff,
rdiff, import and update commands.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory, rather
than recursing through subdirectories.</p>

<p>Available with the following commands: annotate,
checkout, commit, diff, edit, editors, export, log, rdiff,
remove, rtag, status, tag, unedit, update, watch, and
watchers.</p>

<p>-m message</p>

<p>Use message as log information, instead of invoking an
editor.</p>

<p>Available with the following commands: add, commit and
import.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>Do not run any tag program. (A program can be specified
to run in the modules database (see node modules&rsquo; in
the CVS manual); this option bypasses it).</p>

<p>This is not the same as the cvs -n program option, which
you can specify to the left of a cvs command!</p>

<p>Available with the checkout, export, and rtag
commands.</p>

<p>-P</p>

<p>Prune empty directories. See Removing directories&rsquo;
in the CVS man- ual.</p>

<p>-p</p>

<p>Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard
output, rather than writing them in the current directory.
Available with the checkout and update commands.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Process directories recursively. This is on by
default.</p>

<p>Available with the following commands: annotate,
checkout, commit, diff, edit, editors, export, rdiff,
remove, rtag, status, tag, unedit, update, watch, and
watchers.</p>

<p>-r tag</p>

<p>Use the revision specified by the tag argument instead
of the default head revision. As well as arbitrary tags
defined with the tag or rtag command, two special tags are
always available: HEAD refers to the most recent version
available in the repository, and BASE refers to the revision
you last checked out into the current working direc-
tory.</p>

<p>The tag specification is sticky when you use this with
checkout or update to make your own copy of a file: cvs
remembers the tag and continues to use it on future update
commands, until you specify oth- erwise (for more
information on sticky tags/dates, see node Sticky
tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>The tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag, as
described in Tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual, or the name of a
branch, as described in Branching and merging&rsquo; in the
CVS manual. When a command expects a specific revision, the
name of a branch is interpreted as the most recent revision
on that branch.</p>

<p>Specifying the -q global option along with the -r
command option is often useful, to suppress the warning
messages when the rcs file does not contain the specified
tag.</p>

<p>This is not the same as the overall cvs -r option, which
you can specify to the left of a cvs command!</p>

<p>-r is available with the annotate, checkout, commit,
diff, history, export, rdiff, rtag, and update commands.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>Specify file names that should be filtered. You can use
this option repeatedly. The spec can be a file name pattern
of the same type that you can specify in the .cvswrappers
file. Available with the following commands: import, and
update.</p>

<p>add Add files and directories to the repository &middot;
Synopsis: add [-k rcs-kflag] [-m message] files...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository, working directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: repository, working directory.</p>

<p>The add command is used to present new files and
directories for addition into the cvs repository. When add
is used on a directory, a new directory is created in the
repository immediately. When used on a file, only the
working directory is updated. Changes to the repos- itory
are not made until the commit command is used on the newly
added file.</p>

<p>The add command also resurrects files that have been
previously removed. This can be done before or after the
commit command is used to finalize the removal of files.
Resurrected files are restored into the working directory at
the time the add command is executed.</p>

<p>add options These standard options are supported by add
(see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual, for a
complete description of them):</p>

<p>-k kflag</p>

<p>Process keywords according to kflag. See Keyword
substitution&rsquo; in the CVS manual. This option is
sticky; future updates of this file in this working
directory will use the same kflag. The status com- mand can
be viewed to see the sticky options. For more information on
the status command, see node Invoking CVS&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>-m message</p>

<p>Use message as the log message, instead of invoking an
editor.</p>

<p>add examples Adding a directory $ mkdir doc $ cvs add
doc Directory /path/to/repository/doc added to the
repository</p>

<p>Adding a file $ &gt;TODO $ cvs add TODO cvs add:
scheduling file &lsquo;TODO&rsquo; for addition cvs add: use
&rsquo;cvs commit&rsquo; to add this file permanently</p>

<p>Undoing a remove command $ rm -f makefile $ cvs remove
makefile cvs remove: scheduling &lsquo;makefile&rsquo; for
removal cvs remove: use &rsquo;cvs commit&rsquo; to remove
this file permanently $ cvs add makefile U makefile cvs add:
makefile, version 1.2, resurrected</p>

<p>admin Administration &middot; Requires: repository,
working directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Synonym: rcs</p>

<p>This is the cvs interface to assorted administrative
facilities. Some of them have questionable usefulness for
cvs but exist for his- torical purposes. Some of the
questionable options are likely to disappear in the future.
This command does work recursively, so extreme care should
be used.</p>

<p>On unix, if there is a group named cvsadmin, only
members of that group can run cvs admin (except for the cvs
admin -k command, which can be run by anybody). This group
should exist on the server, or any system running the
non-client/server cvs. To disallow cvs admin for all users,
create a group with no users in it. On NT, the cvsad- min
feature does not exist and all users can run cvs admin.</p>

<p>admin options Some of these options have questionable
usefulness for cvs but exist for historical purposes. Some
even make it impossible to use cvs until you undo the
effect!</p>

<p>-Aoldfile</p>

<p>Might not work together with cvs. Append the access list
of oldfile to the access list of the rcs file.</p>

<p>-alogins</p>

<p>Might not work together with cvs. Append the login names
appearing in the comma-separated list logins to the access
list of the rcs file.</p>

<p>-b[rev]</p>

<p>Set the default branch to rev. In cvs, you normally do
not manipu- late default branches; sticky tags (see node
Sticky tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual) are a better way to
decide which branch you want to work on. There is one reason
to run cvs admin -b: to revert to the vendor&rsquo;s version
when using vendor branches (see node Reverting local
changes&rsquo; in the CVS manual). There can be no space
between -b and its argument.</p>

<p>-cstring</p>

<p>Sets the comment leader to string. The comment leader is
not used by current versions of cvs or rcs 5.7. Therefore,
you can almost surely not worry about it. See Keyword
substitution&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-e[logins]</p>

<p>Might not work together with cvs. Erase the login names
appearing in the comma-separated list logins from the access
list of the RCS file. If logins is omitted, erase the entire
access list. There can be no space between -e and its
argument.</p>

<p>-I</p>

<p>Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a
terminal. This option does not work with the client/server
cvs and is likely to disappear in a future release of
cvs.</p>

<p>-i</p>

<p>Useless with cvs. This creates and initializes a new rcs
file, with- out depositing a revision. With cvs, add files
with the cvs add com- mand (see node Adding files&rsquo; in
the CVS manual).</p>

<p>-ksubst</p>

<p>Set the default keyword substitution to subst. See
Keyword substi- tution&rsquo; in the CVS manual. Giving an
explicit -k option to cvs update, cvs export, or cvs
checkout overrides this default.</p>

<p>-l[rev]</p>

<p>Lock the revision with number rev. If a branch is given,
lock the latest revision on that branch. If rev is omitted,
lock the latest revision on the default branch. There can be
no space between -l and its argument.</p>

<p>This can be used in conjunction with the rcslock.pl
script in the contrib directory of the cvs source
distribution to provide reserved checkouts (where only one
user can be editing a given file at a time). See the
comments in that file for details (and see the README file
in that directory for disclaimers about the unsupported
nature of contrib). According to comments in that file,
locking must set to strict (which is the default).</p>

<p>-L</p>

<p>Set locking to strict. Strict locking means that the
owner of an RCS file is not exempt from locking for checkin.
For use with cvs, strict locking must be set; see the
discussion under the -l option above.</p>

<p>-mrev:msg</p>

<p>Replace the log message of revision rev with msg.</p>

<p>-Nname[:[rev]]</p>

<p>Act like -n, except override any previous assignment of
name. For use with magic branches, see Magic branch
numbers&rsquo; in the CVS man- ual.</p>

<p>-nname[:[rev]]</p>

<p>Associate the symbolic name name with the branch or
revision rev. It is normally better to use cvs tag or cvs
rtag instead. Delete the symbolic name if both : and rev are
omitted; otherwise, print an error message if name is
already associated with another number. If rev is symbolic,
it is expanded before association. A rev consisting of a
branch number followed by a . stands for the current latest
revision in the branch. A : with an empty rev stands for the
current latest revision on the default branch, normally the
trunk. For exam- ple, cvs admin -nname: associates name with
the current latest revi- sion of all the RCS files; this
contrasts with cvs admin -nname:$ which associates name with
the revision numbers extracted from key- word strings in the
corresponding working files.</p>

<p>-orange</p>

<p>Deletes (outdates) the revisions given by range.</p>

<p>Note that this command can be quite dangerous unless you
know exactly what you are doing (for example see the
warnings below about how the rev1:rev2 syntax is
confusing).</p>

<p>If you are short on disc this option might help you. But
think twice before using itthere is no way short of
restoring the latest backup to undo this command! If you
delete different revisions than you planned, either due to
carelessness or (heaven forbid) a cvs bug, there is no
opportunity to correct the error before the revisions are
deleted. It probably would be a good idea to experiment on a
copy of the repository first.</p>

<p>Specify range in one of the following ways:</p>

<p>rev1::rev2</p>

<p>Collapse all revisions between rev1 and rev2, so that
cvs only stores the differences associated with going from
rev1 to rev2, not intermediate steps. For example, after -o
1.3::1.5 one can retrieve revision 1.3, revision 1.5, or the
differences to get from 1.3 to 1.5, but not the revision
1.4, or the differences between 1.3 and 1.4. Other examples:
-o 1.3::1.4 and -o 1.3::1.3 have no effect, because there
are no intermediate revisions to remove.</p>

<p>::rev</p>

<p>Collapse revisions between the beginning of the branch
containing rev and rev itself. The branchpoint and rev are
left intact. For example, -o ::1.3.2.6 deletes revision
1.3.2.1, revision 1.3.2.5, and everything in between, but
leaves 1.3 and 1.3.2.6 intact.</p>

<p>rev::</p>

<p>Collapse revisions between rev and the end of the branch
containing rev. Revision rev is left intact but the head
revision is deleted.</p>

<p>rev</p>

<p>Delete the revision rev. For example, -o 1.3 is
equivalent to -o 1.2::1.4.</p>

<p>rev1:rev2</p>

<p>Delete the revisions from rev1 to rev2, inclusive, on
the same branch. One will not be able to retrieve rev1 or
rev2 or any of the revisions in between. For example, the
command cvs admin -oR_1_01:R_1_02 . is rarely useful. It
means to delete revisions up to, and including, the tag
R_1_02. But beware! If there are files that have not changed
between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will have the same
numerical revision number assigned to the tags R_1_02 and
R_1_03. So not only will it be impossible to retrieve
R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to be restored from the tapes!
In most cases you want to specify rev1::rev2 instead.</p>

<p>:rev</p>

<p>Delete revisions from the beginning of the branch
containing rev up to and including rev.</p>

<p>rev:</p>

<p>Delete revisions from revision rev, including rev
itself, to the end of the branch containing rev.</p>

<p>None of the revisions to be deleted may have branches or
locks.</p>

<p>If any of the revisions to be deleted have symbolic
names, and one specifies one of the :: syntaxes, then cvs
will give an error and not delete any revisions. If you
really want to delete both the symbolic names and the
revisions, first delete the symbolic names with cvs tag -d,
then run cvs admin -o. If one specifies the non-:: syntaxes,
then cvs will delete the revisions but leave the symbolic
names pointing to nonexistent revisions. This behavior is
preserved for compatibility with previous versions of cvs,
but because it isn&rsquo;t very useful, in the future it may
change to be like the :: case.</p>

<p>Due to the way cvs handles branches rev cannot be
specified symbol- ically if it is a branch. See Magic branch
numbers&rsquo; in the CVS manual for an explanation.</p>

<p>Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the
revision you outdate. Strange things will happen if he
starts to edit it and tries to check it back in. For this
reason, this option is not a good way to take back a bogus
commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus change
instead (see node Merging two revisions&rsquo; in the CVS
manual).</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.</p>

<p>-sstate[:rev]</p>

<p>Useful with cvs. Set the state attribute of the revision
rev to state. If rev is a branch number, assume the latest
revision on that branch. If rev is omitted, assume the
latest revision on the default branch. Any identifier is
acceptable for state. A useful set of states is Exp (for
experimental), Stab (for stable), and Rel (for released). By
default, the state of a new revision is set to Exp when it
is created. The state is visible in the output from cvs log
(see node log&rsquo; in the CVS manual), and in the $Log$
and $State$ key- words (see node Keyword substitution&rsquo;
in the CVS manual). Note that cvs uses the dead state for
its own purposes (see node Attic&rsquo; in the CVS manual);
to take a file to or from the dead state use commands like
cvs remove and cvs add (see node Adding and removing&rsquo;
in the CVS manual), not cvs admin -s.</p>

<p>-t[file]</p>

<p>Useful with cvs. Write descriptive text from the
contents of the named file into the RCS file, deleting the
existing text. The file pathname may not begin with -. The
descriptive text can be seen in the output from cvs log (see
node log&rsquo; in the CVS manual). There can be no space
between -t and its argument.</p>

<p>If file is omitted, obtain the text from standard input,
terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing . by
itself. Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see
-I.</p>

<p>-t-string</p>

<p>Similar to -tfile. Write descriptive text from the
string into the rcs file, deleting the existing text. There
can be no space between -t and its argument.</p>

<p>-U</p>

<p>Set locking to non-strict. Non-strict locking means that
the owner of a file need not lock a revision for checkin.
For use with cvs, strict locking must be set; see the
discussion under the -l option above.</p>

<p>-u[rev]</p>

<p>See the option -l above, for a discussion of using this
option with cvs. Unlock the revision with number rev. If a
branch is given, unlock the latest revision on that branch.
If rev is omitted, remove the latest lock held by the
caller. Normally, only the locker of a revision may unlock
it; somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock. This
causes the original locker to be sent a commit notifica-
tion (see node Getting Notified&rsquo; in the CVS manual).
There can be no space between -u and its argument.</p>

<p>-Vn</p>

<p>In previous versions of cvs, this option meant to write
an rcs file which would be acceptable to rcs version n, but
it is now obsolete and specifying it will produce an
error.</p>

<p>-xsuffixes</p>

<p>In previous versions of cvs, this was documented as a
way of specify- ing the names of the rcs files. However, cvs
has always required that the rcs files used by cvs end in
,v, so this option has never done anything useful.</p>

<p>annotate What revision modified each line of a file?
&middot; Synopsis: annotate [options] files...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Synonym: blame</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: nothing.</p>

<p>For each file in files, print the head revision of the
trunk, together with information on the last modification
for each line.</p>

<p>annotate options These standard options are supported by
annotate (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual
for a complete description of them):</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local directory only, no recursion.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Process directories recursively.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>Use head revision if tag/date not found.</p>

<p>-F</p>

<p>Annotate binary files.</p>

<p>-r revision</p>

<p>Annotate file as of specified revision/tag.</p>

<p>-D date</p>

<p>Annotate file as of specified date.</p>

<p>annotate example For example:</p>

<p>$ cvs annotate ssfile Annotations for ssfile
*************** 1.1 (mary 27-Mar-96): ssfile line 1 1.2 (joe
28-Mar-96): ssfile line 2</p>

<p>The file ssfile currently contains two lines. The ssfile
line 1 line was checked in by mary on March 27. Then, on
March 28, joe added a line ssfile line 2, without modifying
the ssfile line 1 line. This report doesn&rsquo;t tell you
anything about lines which have been deleted or replaced;
you need to use cvs diff for that (see node diff&rsquo; in
the CVS manual).</p>

<p>The options to cvs annotate are listed in Invoking
CVS&rsquo; in the CVS manual, and can be used to select the
files and revisions to annotate. The options are described
in more detail there and in Common options&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>checkout Check out sources for editing &middot;
Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: working directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Synonyms: co, get</p>

<p>Create or update a working directory containing copies
of the source files specified by modules. You must execute
checkout before using most of the other cvs commands, since
most of them operate on your working directory.</p>

<p>The modules are either symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to
directories or files in the repos- itory. The symbolic names
are defined in the modules file. See modules&rsquo; in the
CVS manual.</p>

<p>Depending on the modules you specify, checkout may
recursively create directories and populate them with the
appropriate source files. You can then edit these source
files at any time (regardless of whether other software
developers are editing their own copies of the sources);
update them to include new changes applied by others to the
source repository; or commit your work as a permanent change
to the source repository.</p>

<p>Note that checkout is used to create directories. The
top-level directory created is always added to the directory
where checkout is invoked, and usually has the same name as
the specified module. In the case of a module alias, the
created sub-directory may have a dif- ferent name, but you
can be sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
checkout will show the relative path leading to each file as
it is extracted into your private work area (unless you
specify the -Q global option).</p>

<p>The files created by checkout are created read-write,
unless the -r option to cvs (see node Global options&rsquo;
in the CVS manual) is speci- fied, the CVSREAD environment
variable is specified (see node Envi- ronment
variables&rsquo; in the CVS manual), or a watch is in effect
for that file (see node Watches&rsquo; in the CVS
manual).</p>

<p>Note that running checkout on a directory that was
already built by a prior checkout is also permitted. This is
similar to specifying the -d option to the update command in
the sense that new directories that have been created in the
repository will appear in your work area. However, checkout
takes a module name whereas update takes a directory name.
Also to use checkout this way it must be run from the top
level directory (where you originally ran checkout from), so
before you run checkout to update an existing directory,
don&rsquo;t forget to change your directory to the top level
directory.</p>

<p>For the output produced by the checkout command, see
node update output&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>checkout options These standard options are supported by
checkout (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual
for a complete description of them):</p>

<p>-D date</p>

<p>Use the most recent revision no later than date. This
option is sticky, and implies -P. See Sticky tags&rsquo; in
the CVS manual for more information on sticky
tags/dates.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>Only useful with the -D date or -r tag flags. If no
matching revi- sion is found, retrieve the most recent
revision (instead of ignoring the file).</p>

<p>-k kflag</p>

<p>Process keywords according to kflag. See Keyword
substitution&rsquo; in the CVS manual. This option is
sticky; future updates of this file in this working
directory will use the same kflag. The status com- mand can
be viewed to see the sticky options. See Invoking CVS&rsquo;
in the CVS manual for more information on the status
command.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>Do not run any checkout program (as specified with the
-o option in the modules file; see node modules&rsquo; in
the CVS manual).</p>

<p>-P</p>

<p>Prune empty directories. See Moving directories&rsquo;
in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-p</p>

<p>Pipe files to the standard output.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Checkout directories recursively. This option is on by
default.</p>

<p>-r tag</p>

<p>Use revision tag. This option is sticky, and implies -P.
See Sticky tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual, for more
information on sticky tags/dates.</p>

<p>In addition to those, you can use these special command
options with checkout:</p>

<p>-A</p>

<p>Reset any sticky tags, dates, or -k options. Does not
reset sticky -k options on modified files. See Sticky
tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual for more information on sticky
tags/dates.</p>

<p>-c</p>

<p>Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output,
instead of cre- ating or modifying any files or directories
in your working direc- tory.</p>

<p>-d dir</p>

<p>Create a directory called dir for the working files,
instead of using the module name. In general, using this
flag is equivalent to using mkdir dir; cd dir followed by
the checkout command without the -d flag.</p>

<p>There is an important exception, however. It is very
convenient when checking out a single item to have the
output appear in a directory that doesn&rsquo;t contain
empty intermediate directories. In this case only, cvs tries
to &lsquo;&lsquo;shorten&rsquo;&rsquo; pathnames to avoid
those empty directories.</p>

<p>For example, given a module foo that contains the file
bar.c, the command cvs co -d dir foo will create directory
dir and place bar.c inside. Similarly, given a module bar
which has subdirectory baz wherein there is a file quux.c,
the command cvs co -d dir bar/baz will create directory dir
and place quux.c inside.</p>

<p>Using the -N flag will defeat this behavior. Given the
same module definitions above, cvs co -N -d dir foo will
create directories dir/foo and place bar.c inside, while cvs
co -N -d dir bar/baz will create directories dir/bar/baz and
place quux.c inside.</p>

<p>-j tag</p>

<p>With two -j options, merge changes from the revision
specified with the first -j option to the revision specified
with the second j option, into the working directory.</p>

<p>With one -j option, merge changes from the ancestor
revision to the revision specified with the -j option, into
the working directory. The ancestor revision is the common
ancestor of the revision which the working directory is
based on, and the revision specified in the -j option.</p>

<p>In addition, each -j option can contain an optional date
specifica- tion which, when used with branches, can limit
the chosen revision to one within a specific date. An
optional date is specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag:
-jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier.</p>

<p>See Branching and merging&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-N</p>

<p>Only useful together with -d dir. With this option, cvs
will not &lsquo;&lsquo;shorten&rsquo;&rsquo; module paths in
your working directory when you check out a single module.
See the -d flag for examples and a discussion.</p>

<p>-s</p>

<p>Like -c, but include the status of all modules, and sort
it by the status string. See modules&rsquo; in the CVS
manual, for info about the -s option that is used inside the
modules file to set the module sta- tus.</p>

<p>checkout examples Get a copy of the module tc:</p>

<p>$ cvs checkout tc</p>

<p>Get a copy of the module tc as it looked one day
ago:</p>

<p>$ cvs checkout -D yesterday tc</p>

<p>commit Check files into the repository &middot;
Synopsis: commit [-lRf] [-m &rsquo;log_message&rsquo; | -F
file] [-r revision] [files...]</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: working directory, repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Synonym: ci</p>

<p>Use commit when you want to incorporate changes from
your working source files into the source repository.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t specify particular files to commit,
all of the files in your working current directory are
examined. commit is careful to change in the repository only
those files that you have really changed. By default (or if
you explicitly specify the -R option), files in
subdirectories are also examined and committed if they have
changed; you can use the -l option to limit commit to the
current directory only.</p>

<p>commit verifies that the selected files are up to date
with the cur- rent revisions in the source repository; it
will notify you, and exit without committing, if any of the
specified files must be made cur- rent first with update
(see node update&rsquo; in the CVS manual). commit does not
call the update command for you, but rather leaves that for
you to do when the time is right.</p>

<p>When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to
enter a log message that will be written to one or more
logging programs (see node modules&rsquo; in the CVS manual,
and see node loginfo&rsquo; in the CVS manual) and placed in
the rcs file inside the repository. This log message can be
retrieved with the log command; see node log&rsquo; in the
CVS manual. You can specify the log message on the command
line with the -m message option, and thus avoid the editor
invocation, or use the -F file option to specify that the
argument file contains the log message.</p>

<p>commit options These standard options are supported by
commit (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for
a complete description of them):</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Commit directories recursively. This is on by
default.</p>

<p>-r revision</p>

<p>Commit to revision. revision must be either a branch, or
a revision on the main trunk that is higher than any
existing revision number (see node Assigning
revisions&rsquo; in the CVS manual). You cannot com- mit to
a specific revision on a branch.</p>

<p>commit also supports these options:</p>

<p>-F file</p>

<p>Read the log message from file, instead of invoking an
editor.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>Note that this is not the standard behavior of the -f
option as defined in Common options&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>Force cvs to commit a new revision even if you
haven&rsquo;t made any changes to the file. If the current
revision of file is 1.7, then the following two commands are
equivalent:</p>

<p>$ cvs commit -f file $ cvs commit -r 1.8 file</p>

<p>The -f option disables recursion (i.e., it implies -l).
To force cvs to commit a new revision for all files in all
subdirectories, you must use -f -R.</p>

<p>-m message</p>

<p>Use message as the log message, instead of invoking an
editor.</p>

<p>commit examples Committing to a branch You can commit to
a branch revision (one that has an even number of dots) with
the -r option. To create a branch revision, use the -b
option of the rtag or tag commands (see node Branching and
merging&rsquo; in the CVS manual). Then, either checkout or
update can be used to base your sources on the newly created
branch. From that point on, all com- mit changes made within
these working sources will be automatically added to a
branch revision, thereby not disturbing main-line develop-
ment in any way. For example, if you had to create a patch
to the 1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0
version is already under development, you might do:</p>

<p>$ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module $
cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module $ cd
product_module [[ hack away ]] $ cvs commit</p>

<p>This works automatically since the -r option is
sticky.</p>

<p>Creating the branch after editing Say you have been
working on some extremely experimental software, based on
whatever revision you happened to checkout last week. If
oth- ers in your group would like to work on this software
with you, but without disturbing main-line development, you
could commit your change to a new branch. Others can then
checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full
benefit of cvs conflict resolution. The scenario might look
like:</p>

<p>[[ hacked sources are present ]] $ cvs tag -b EXPR1 $
cvs update -r EXPR1 $ cvs commit</p>

<p>The update command will make the -r EXPR1 option sticky
on all files. Note that your changes to the files will never
be removed by the update command. The commit will
automatically commit to the correct branch, because the -r
is sticky. You could also do like this:</p>

<p>[[ hacked sources are present ]] $ cvs tag -b EXPR1 $
cvs commit -r EXPR1</p>

<p>but then, only those files that were changed by you will
have the -r EXPR1 sticky flag. If you hack away, and commit
without specifying the -r EXPR1 flag, some files may
accidentally end up on the main trunk.</p>

<p>To work with you on the experimental change, others
would simply do</p>

<p>$ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module</p>

<p>diff Show differences between revisions &middot;
Synopsis: diff [-lR] [-k kflag] [format_options] [[-r rev1 |
-D date1] [-r rev2 | -D date2]] [files...]</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: working directory, repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: nothing.</p>

<p>The diff command is used to compare different revisions
of files. The default action is to compare your working
files with the revi- sions they were based on, and report
any differences that are found.</p>

<p>If any file names are given, only those files are
compared. If any directories are given, all files under them
will be compared.</p>

<p>The exit status for diff is different than for other cvs
commands; for details see node Exit status&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>diff options These standard options are supported by
diff (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for a
complete description of them):</p>

<p>-D date</p>

<p>Use the most recent revision no later than date. See -r
for how this affects the comparison.</p>

<p>-k kflag</p>

<p>Process keywords according to kflag. See Keyword
substitution&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Examine directories recursively. This option is on by
default.</p>

<p>-r tag</p>

<p>Compare with revision tag. Zero, one or two -r options
can be present. With no -r option, the working file will be
compared with the revision it was based on. With one -r,
that revision will be compared to your current working file.
With two -r options those two revisions will be compared
(and your working file will not affect the outcome in any
way).</p>

<p>One or both -r options can be replaced by a -D date
option, described above.</p>

<p>The following options specify the format of the output.
They have the same meaning as in GNU diff. Most options have
two equivalent names, one of which is a single letter
preceded by -, and the other of which is a long name
preceded by --.</p>

<p>-lines</p>

<p>Show lines (an integer) lines of context. This option
does not spec- ify an output format by itself; it has no
effect unless it is com- bined with -c or -u. This option is
obsolete. For proper operation, patch typically needs at
least two lines of context.</p>

<p>-a</p>

<p>Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line,
even if they do not seem to be text.</p>

<p>-b</p>

<p>Ignore trailing white space and consider all other
sequences of one or more white space characters to be
equivalent.</p>

<p>-B</p>

<p>Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank
lines.</p>

<p>--binary</p>

<p>Read and write data in binary mode.</p>

<p>--brief</p>

<p>Report only whether the files differ, not the details of
the differ- ences.</p>

<p>-c</p>

<p>Use the context output format.</p>

<p>-C lines</p>

<p>--context[=lines]</p>

<p>Use the context output format, showing lines (an
integer) lines of context, or three if lines is not given.
For proper operation, patch typically needs at least two
lines of context.</p>

<p>--changed-group-format=format</p>

<p>Use format to output a line group containing differing
lines from both files in if-then-else format. See Line group
formats&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of
changes. This makes diff slower (sometimes much slower).</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--ed</p>

<p>Make output that is a valid ed script.</p>

<p>--expand-tabs</p>

<p>Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the
alignment of tabs in the input files.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>Make output that looks vaguely like an ed script but has
changes in the order they appear in the file.</p>

<p>-F regexp</p>

<p>In context and unified format, for each hunk of
differences, show some of the last preceding line that
matches regexp.</p>

<p>--forward-ed</p>

<p>Make output that looks vaguely like an ed script but has
changes in the order they appear in the file.</p>

<p>-H</p>

<p>Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that
have numerous scattered small changes.</p>

<p>--horizon-lines=lines</p>

<p>Do not discard the last lines lines of the common prefix
and the first lines lines of the common suffix.</p>

<p>-i</p>

<p>Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case
letters equiv- alent.</p>

<p>-I regexp</p>

<p>Ignore white space when comparing lines.</p>

<p>--ignore-blank-lines</p>

<p>Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank
lines.</p>

<p>Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case
to be the same.</p>

<p>--ignore-matching-lines=regexp</p>

<p>Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that
match regexp.</p>

<p>--ignore-space-change</p>

<p>Ignore trailing white space and consider all other
sequences of one or more white space characters to be
equivalent.</p>

<p>--initial-tab</p>

<p>Output a tab rather than a space before the text of a
line in normal or context format. This causes the alignment
of tabs in the line to look normal.</p>

<p>-L label</p>

<p>Use format to output all input lines in if-then-else
format. See Line formats&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>--minimal</p>

<p>Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of
changes. This makes diff slower (sometimes much slower).</p>

<p>Output RCS-format diffs; like -f except that each
command specifies the number of lines affected.</p>

<p>-N</p>

<p>In directory comparison, if a file is found in only one
directory, treat it as present but empty in the other
directory.</p>

file in if- then-else format. See Line formats&rsquo; in the
CVS manual.</p>

<p>--old-group-format=format</p>

<p>Use format to output a group of lines taken from just
the first file in if-then-else format. See Line group
formats&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>--old-line-format=format</p>

<p>Use format to output a line taken from just the first
file in if- then-else format. See Line formats&rsquo; in the
CVS manual.</p>

<p>-p</p>

<p>Show which C function each change is in.</p>

<p>--rcs</p>

<p>Output RCS-format diffs; like -f except that each
command specifies the number of lines affected.</p>

<p>--report-identical-files</p>

<p>-s</p>

<p>Report when two files are the same.</p>

<p>--show-c-function</p>

<p>Show which C function each change is in.</p>

<p>--show-function-line=regexp</p>

<p>In context and unified format, for each hunk of
differences, show some of the last preceding line that
matches regexp.</p>

<p>--side-by-side</p>

<p>Use the side by side output format.</p>

<p>--speed-large-files</p>

<p>Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that
have numerous scattered small changes.</p>

<p>--suppress-common-lines</p>

<p>Do not print common lines in side by side format.</p>

<p>-t</p>

<p>Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the
alignment of tabs in the input files.</p>

<p>-T</p>

<p>Output a tab rather than a space before the text of a
line in normal or context format. This causes the alignment
of tabs in the line to look normal.</p>

<p>--text</p>

<p>Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line,
even if they do not appear to be text.</p>

<p>-u</p>

<p>Use the unified output format.</p>

<p>--unchanged-group-format=format</p>

<p>Use format to output a group of common lines taken from
both files in if-then-else format. see node Line group
formats&rsquo; in the CVS man- ual.</p>

<p>--unchanged-line-format=format</p>

<p>Use format to output a line common to both files in
if-then-else for- mat. see node Line formats&rsquo; in the
CVS manual.</p>

<p>-U lines</p>

<p>Use the side by side output format.</p>

<p>Line group formats Line group formats let you specify
formats suitable for many applica- tions that allow
if-then-else input, including programming languages and text
formatting languages. A line group format specifies the out-
put format for a contiguous group of similar lines.</p>

<p>For example, the following command compares the TeX file
myfile with the original version from the repository, and
outputs a merged file in b which old regions are surrounded
byeegin{em}end{em} lines, and new b regions are surrounded

<p>g i cvs diff --old-group-format=&rsquo;nm} {%&lt;\nd{em}
g i n &rsquo; --new-group-format=&rsquo;{ b f } %&gt;\nd{bf}
&rsquo; myfile</p>

<p>The following command is equivalent to the above
example, but it is a little more verbose, because it spells
out the default line group for- mats.</p>

<p>g i cvs diff --old-group-format=&rsquo;nm} {%&lt;\nd{em}
g i n &rsquo; --new-group-format=&rsquo;{ b f } %&gt;\nd{bf}
&rsquo; --unchanged-group-format=&rsquo;%=&rsquo; g i
--changed-group-format=&rsquo;nm} {%&lt;\nd{em} g i n { b f
} %&gt;\nd{bf} &rsquo; myfile</p>

<p>Here is a more advanced example, which outputs a diff
listing with headers containing line numbers in a
&lsquo;&lsquo;plain English&rsquo;&rsquo; style.</p>

<p>cvs diff --unchanged-group-format=&rsquo;&rsquo;
--old-group-format=&rsquo;-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) deleted
at %df: %&lt;&rsquo; --new-group-format=&rsquo;-------- %dN
line%(N=1?:s) added after %de: %&gt;&rsquo;
--changed-group-format=&rsquo;-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s)
changed at %df: %&lt;-------- to: %&gt;&rsquo; myfile</p>

<p>To specify a line group format, use one of the options
listed below. You can specify up to four line group formats,
one for each kind of line group. You should quote format,
because it typically contains shell metacharacters.</p>

<p>--old-group-format=format</p>

<p>These line groups are hunks containing only lines from
the first file. The default old group format is the same as
the changed group format if it is specified; otherwise it is
a format that outputs the line group as-is.</p>

<p>--new-group-format=format</p>

<p>These line groups are hunks containing only lines from
the second file. The default new group format is same as the
changed group for- mat if it is specified; otherwise it is a
format that outputs the line group as-is.</p>

<p>--changed-group-format=format</p>

<p>These line groups are hunks containing lines from both
files. The default changed group format is the concatenation
of the old and new group formats.</p>

<p>--unchanged-group-format=format</p>

<p>These line groups contain lines common to both files.
The default unchanged group format is a format that outputs
the line group as-is.</p>

<p>In a line group format, ordinary characters represent
themselves; conversion specifications start with % and have
one of the following forms.</p>

<p>%&lt;</p>

<p>stands for the lines from the first file, including the
trailing new- line. Each line is formatted according to the
old line format (see node Line formats&rsquo; in the CVS
manual).</p>

<p>%&gt;</p>

<p>stands for the lines from the second file, including the
trailing newline. Each line is formatted according to the
new line format.</p>

<p>%=</p>

<p>stands for the lines common to both files, including the
trailing newline. Each line is formatted according to the
unchanged line for- mat.</p>

<p>%%</p>

<p>stands for %.</p>

<p>%c&rsquo;C&rsquo;</p>

<p>where C is a single character, stands for C. C may not
be a back- slash or an apostrophe. For example,
%c&rsquo;:&rsquo; stands for a colon, even inside the
then-part of an if-then-else format, which a colon would
normally terminate.</p>

<p>%cO&rsquo;</p>

<p>where O is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands
for the char- acter with octal code O. For example,
%c0&rsquo; stands for a null char- acter.</p>

<p>Fn</p>

<p>where F is a printf conversion specification and n is
one of the fol- lowing letters, stands for n&rsquo;s value
formatted with F.</p>

<p>e</p>

<p>The line number of the line just before the group in the
old file.</p>

<p>f</p>

<p>The line number of the first line in the group in the
old file; equals e + 1.</p>

<p>l</p>

<p>The line number of the last line in the group in the old
file.</p>

<p>m</p>

<p>The line number of the line just after the group in the
old file; equals l + 1.</p>

<p>n</p>

<p>The number of lines in the group in the old file; equals
l - f + 1.</p>

<p>E, F, L, M, N</p>

<p>Likewise, for lines in the new file.</p>

<p>The printf conversion specification can be %d, %o, %x,
or %X, spec- ifying decimal, octal, lower case hexadecimal,
or upper case hex- adecimal output respectively. After the %
the following options can appear in sequence: a - specifying
left-justification; an inte- ger specifying the minimum
field width; and a period followed by an optional integer
specifying the minimum number of digits. For example, %5dN
prints the number of new lines in the group in a field of
width 5 characters, using the printf format
&quot;%5d&quot;.</p>

<p>(A=B?T:E)</p>

<p>If A equals B then T else E. A and B are each either a
decimal con- stant or a single letter interpreted as above.
This format spec is equivalent to T if A&rsquo;s value
equals B&rsquo;s; otherwise it is equivalent to E.</p>

<p>For example, %(N=0?no:%dN) line%(N=1?:s) is equivalent
to no lines if N (the number of lines in the group in the
new file) is 0, to 1 line if N is 1, and to %dN lines
otherwise.</p>

<p>Line formats Line formats control how each line taken
from an input file is output as part of a line group in
if-then-else format.</p>

<p>For example, the following command outputs text with a
one-column change indicator to the left of the text. The
first column of output is - for deleted lines, | for added
lines, and a space for unchanged lines. The formats contain
newline characters where newlines are desired on output.</p>

<p>cvs diff --old-line-format=&rsquo;-%l &rsquo;
--new-line-format=&rsquo;|%l &rsquo;
--unchanged-line-format=&rsquo; %l &rsquo; myfile</p>

<p>To specify a line format, use one of the following
options. You should quote format, since it often contains
shell metacharacters.</p>

<p>--old-line-format=format</p>

<p>formats lines just from the first file.</p>

<p>--new-line-format=format</p>

<p>formats lines just from the second file.</p>

<p>--unchanged-line-format=format</p>

<p>formats lines common to both files.</p>

<p>--line-format=format</p>

<p>formats all lines; in effect, it sets all three above
options simul- taneously.</p>

<p>In a line format, ordinary characters represent
themselves; conver- sion specifications start with % and
have one of the following forms.</p>

<p>%l</p>

<p>stands for the contents of the line, not counting its
trailing new- line (if any). This format ignores whether the
line is incomplete.</p>

<p>%L</p>

<p>stands for the contents of the line, including its
trailing newline (if any). If a line is incomplete, this
format preserves its incom- pleteness.</p>

<p>%%</p>

<p>stands for %.</p>

<p>%c&rsquo;C&rsquo;</p>

<p>where C is a single character, stands for C. C may not
be a back- slash or an apostrophe. For example,
%c&rsquo;:&rsquo; stands for a colon.</p>

<p>%cO&rsquo;</p>

<p>where O is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands
for the char- acter with octal code O. For example,
%c0&rsquo; stands for a null char- acter.</p>

<p>Fn</p>

<p>where F is a printf conversion specification, stands for
the line number formatted with F. For example, %.5dn prints
the line number using the printf format &quot;%.5d&quot;.
see node Line group formats&rsquo; in the CVS manual, for
more about printf conversion specifications.</p>

<p>The default line format is %l followed by a newline
character.</p>

<p>If the input contains tab characters and it is important
that they line up on output, you should ensure that %l or %L
in a line format is just after a tab stop (e.g. by preceding
%l or %L with a tab char- acter), or you should use the -t
or --expand-tabs option.</p>

<p>Taken together, the line and line group formats let you
specify many different formats. For example, the following
command uses a format similar to diff&rsquo;s normal format.
You can tailor this command to get fine control over
diff&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p>cvs diff --old-line-format=&rsquo;&lt; %l &rsquo;
--new-line-format=&rsquo;&gt; %l &rsquo;
--old-group-format=&rsquo;%df%(f=l?:,%dl)d%dE %&lt;&rsquo;
--new-group-format=&rsquo;%dea%dF%(F=L?:,%dL) %&gt;&rsquo;
--changed-group-format=&rsquo;%df%(f=l?:,%dl)c%dF%(F=L?:,%dL)
%&lt; %&gt;&rsquo; --unchanged-group-format=&rsquo;&rsquo;
myfile</p>

<p>diff examples The following line produces a Unidiff (-u
flag) between revision 1.14 and 1.19 of backend.c. Due to
the -kk flag no keywords are substi- tuted, so differences
that only depend on keyword substitution are ignored.</p>

<p>$ cvs diff -kk -u -r 1.14 -r 1.19 backend.c</p>

<p>Suppose the experimental branch EXPR1 was based on a set
of files tagged RELEASE_1_0. To see what has happened on
that branch, the fol- lowing can be used:</p>

<p>$ cvs diff -r RELEASE_1_0 -r EXPR1</p>

<p>A command like this can be used to produce a context
diff between two releases:</p>

<p>$ cvs diff -c -r RELEASE_1_0 -r RELEASE_1_1 &gt;
diffs</p>

<p>If you are maintaining ChangeLogs, a command like the
following just before you commit your changes may help you
write the ChangeLog entry. All local modifications that have
not yet been committed will be printed.</p>

<p>$ cvs diff -u | less</p>

<p>export Export sources from CVS, similar to checkout
&middot; Synopsis: export [-flNnR] [-r rev|-D date] [-k
subst] [-d dir] mod- ule...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: current directory.</p>

<p>This command is a variant of checkout; use it when you
want a copy of the source for module without the cvs
administrative directories. For example, you might use
export to prepare source for shipment off- site. This
command requires that you specify a date or tag (with -D or
-r), so that you can count on reproducing the source you
ship to others (and thus it always prunes empty
directories).</p>

<p>One often would like to use -kv with cvs export. This
causes any keywords to be expanded such that an import done
at some other site will not lose the keyword revision
information. But be aware that doesn&rsquo;t handle an
export containing binary files correctly. Also be aware that
after having used -kv, one can no longer use the ident
command (which is part of the rcs suitesee ident(1)) which
looks for keyword strings. If you want to be able to use
ident you must not use -kv.</p>

<p>export options These standard options are supported by
export (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual,
for a complete description of them):</p>

<p>-D date</p>

<p>Use the most recent revision no later than date.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most
recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>Do not run any checkout program.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Export directories recursively. This is on by
default.</p>

<p>-r tag</p>

<p>Use revision tag.</p>

<p>In addition, these options (that are common to checkout
and export) are also supported:</p>

<p>-d dir</p>

<p>Create a directory called dir for the working files,
instead of using the module name. See checkout
options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for com- plete details on
how cvs handles this flag.</p>

<p>-k subst</p>

<p>Set keyword expansion mode (see node Substitution
modes&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>-N</p>

<p>Only useful together with -d dir. See checkout
options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for complete details on how
cvs handles this flag.</p>

<p>history Show status of files and users &middot;
Synopsis: history [-report] [-flags] [-options args]
[files...]</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: the file $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: nothing.</p>

<p>cvs can keep a history file that tracks each use of the
checkout, commit, rtag, update, and release commands. You
can use history to display this information in various
formats.</p>

<p>Logging must be enabled by creating the file
$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history.</p>

<p>history uses -f, -l, -n, and -p in ways that conflict
with the normal use inside cvs (see node Common
options&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>history options Several options (shown above as -report)
control what kind of report is generated:</p>

<p>-c</p>

<p>Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time the
repository was modified).</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>Everything (all record types). Equivalent to specifying
-x with all record types. Of course, -e will also include
record types which are added in a future version of cvs; if
you are writing a script which can only handle certain
record types, you&rsquo;ll want to specify -x.</p>

<p>-m module</p>

<p>Report on a particular module. (You can meaningfully use
-m more than once on the command line.)</p>

<p>-o</p>

<p>Report on checked-out modules. This is the default
report type.</p>

<p>-T</p>

<p>Report on all tags.</p>

<p>-x type</p>

<p>Extract a particular set of record types type from the
cvs history. The types are indicated by single letters,
which you may specify in combination.</p>

<p>Certain commands have a single record type:</p>

<p>F</p>

<p>release</p>

<p>O</p>

<p>checkout</p>

<p>E</p>

<p>export</p>

<p>T</p>

<p>rtag</p>

<p>One of five record types may result from an update:</p>

<p>C</p>

<p>A merge was necessary but collisions were detected
(requiring man- ual merging).</p>

<p>G</p>

<p>A merge was necessary and it succeeded.</p>

<p>U</p>

<p>A working file was copied from the repository.</p>

<p>P</p>

<p>A working file was patched to match the repository.</p>

<p>W</p>

<p>The working copy of a file was deleted during update
(because it was gone from the repository).</p>

<p>One of three record types results from commit:</p>

<p>A</p>

<p>A file was added for the first time.</p>

<p>M</p>

<p>A file was modified.</p>

<p>R</p>

<p>A file was removed.</p>

<p>The options shown as -flags constrain or expand the
report without requiring option arguments:</p>

<p>-a</p>

<p>Show data for all users (the default is to show data
only for the user executing history).</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Show last modification only.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>Show only the records for modifications done from the
same working directory where history is executing.</p>

<p>The options shown as -options args constrain the report
based on an argument:</p>

<p>-b str</p>

<p>Show data back to a record containing the string str in
either the module name, the file name, or the repository
path.</p>

<p>-D date</p>

<p>Show data since date. This is slightly different from
the normal use of -D date, which selects the newest revision
older than date.</p>

<p>-f file</p>

<p>Show data for a particular file (you can specify several
-f options on the same command line). This is equivalent to
specifying the file on the command line.</p>

<p>-n module</p>

<p>Show data for a particular module (you can specify
several -n options on the same command line).</p>

<p>-p repository</p>

<p>Show data for a particular source repository (you can
specify sev- eral -p options on the same command line).</p>

<p>-r rev</p>

<p>Show records referring to revisions since the revision
or tag named rev appears in individual rcs files. Each rcs
file is searched for the revision or tag.</p>

<p>-t tag</p>

<p>Show records since tag tag was last added to the history
file. This differs from the -r flag above in that it reads
only the history file, not the rcs files, and is much
faster.</p>

<p>-u name</p>

<p>Show records for user name.</p>

<p>-z timezone</p>

<p>Show times in the selected records using the specified
time zone instead of UTC.</p>

<p>import Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches
&middot; Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag
releasetag...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: Repository, source distribution
directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: repository.</p>

<p>Use import to incorporate an entire source distribution
from an out- side source (e.g., a source vendor) into your
source repository directory. You can use this command both
for initial creation of a repository, and for wholesale
updates to the module from the outside source. See Tracking
sources&rsquo; in the CVS manual for a discussion on this
subject.</p>

<p>The repository argument gives a directory name (or a
path to a direc- tory) under the cvs root directory for
repositories; if the directory did not exist, import creates
it.</p>

<p>When you use import for updates to source that has been
modified in your source repository (since a prior import),
it will notify you of any files that conflict in the two
branches of development; use checkout -j to reconcile the
differences, as import instructs you to do.</p>

<p>If cvs decides a file should be ignored (see node
cvsignore&rsquo; in the CVS manual), it does not import it
and prints I followed by the filename (see node import
output&rsquo; in the CVS manual for a complete description
of the output).</p>

<p>If the file $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers exists, any
file whose names match the specifications in that file will
be treated as packages and the appropriate filtering will be
performed on the file/directory before being imported. See
Wrappers&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>The outside source is saved in a first-level branch, by
default 1.1.1. Updates are leaves of this branch; for
example, files from the first imported collection of source
will be revision 1.1.1.1, then files from the first imported
update will be revision 1.1.1.2, and so on.</p>

<p>At least three arguments are required. repository is
needed to iden- tify the collection of source. vendortag is
a tag for the entire branch (e.g., for 1.1.1). You must also
specify at least one releasetag to uniquely identify the
files at the leaves created each time you execute import.
The releasetag should be new, not previ- ously existing in
the repository file, and uniquely identify the imported
release,</p>

<p>Note that import does not change the directory in which
you invoke it. In particular, it does not set up that
directory as a cvs work- ing directory; if you want to work
with the sources import them first and then check them out
into a different directory (see node Getting the
source&rsquo; in the CVS manual).</p>

<p>import options This standard option is supported by
import (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for
a complete description):</p>

<p>-m message</p>

<p>Use message as log information, instead of invoking an
editor.</p>

<p>There are the following additional special options.</p>

<p>-b branch</p>

<p>See Multiple vendor branches&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>Use each file&rsquo;s modification time as the time of
import rather than the current time.</p>

<p>-k subst</p>

<p>Indicate the keyword expansion mode desired. This
setting will apply to all files created during the import,
but not to any files that previously existed in the
repository. See Substitution modes&rsquo; in the CVS manual
for a list of valid -k settings.</p>

<p>-I name</p>

<p>Specify file names that should be ignored during import.
You can use this option repeatedly. To avoid ignoring any
files at all (even those ignored by default), specify
&lsquo;-I !&rsquo;.</p>

<p>name can be a file name pattern of the same type that
you can specify in the .cvsignore file. See cvsignore&rsquo;
in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-W spec</p>

<p>Specify file names that should be filtered during
import. You can use this option repeatedly.</p>

<p>spec can be a file name pattern of the same type that
you can specify in the .cvswrappers file. see node
Wrappers&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>import output import keeps you informed of its progress
by printing a line for each file, preceded by one character
indicating the status of the file:</p>

<p>U file</p>

<p>The file already exists in the repository and has not
been locally modified; a new revision has been created (if
necessary).</p>

<p>N file</p>

<p>The file is a new file which has been added to the
repository.</p>

<p>C file</p>

<p>The file already exists in the repository but has been
locally modi- fied; you will have to merge the changes.</p>

<p>I file</p>

<p>The file is being ignored (see node cvsignore&rsquo; in
the CVS manual).</p>

<p>L file</p>

<p>The file is a symbolic link; cvs import ignores symbolic
links. Peo- ple periodically suggest that this behavior
should be changed, but if there is a consensus on what it
should be changed to, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be apparent.
(Various options in the modules file can be used to recreate
symbolic links on checkout, update, etc.; see node
modules&rsquo; in the CVS manual.)</p>

<p>import examples See Tracking sources&rsquo; in the CVS
manual, and From files&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>log Print out log information for files &middot;
Synopsis: log [options] [files...]</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository, working directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: nothing.</p>

<p>Display log information for files. log used to call the
rcs utility rlog. Although this is no longer true in the
current sources, this history determines the format of the
output and the options, which are not quite in the style of
the other cvs commands.</p>

<p>The output includes the location of the rcs file, the
head revision (the latest revision on the trunk), all
symbolic names (tags) and some other things. For each
revision, the revision number, the author, the number of
lines added/deleted and the log message are printed. All
times are displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
(Other parts of cvs print times in the local timezone).</p>

<p>log uses -R in a way that conflicts with the normal use
inside cvs (see nodeCommon options&rsquo; in the CVS
manual).</p>

<p>log options By default, log prints all information that
is available. All other options restrict the output. Note
that the revision selection options (-b, -d, -r, -s, and -w)
have no effect, other than possibly causing a search for
files in Attic directories, when used in conjunction with
the options that restrict the output to only log header
fields (-h, -R, and -t) unless the -S option is also
specified.</p>

<p>-b</p>

<p>Print information about the revisions on the default
branch, normally the highest branch on the trunk.</p>

<p>-d dates</p>

<p>Print information about revisions with a checkin
date/time in the range given by the semicolon-separated list
of dates. The date for- mats accepted are those accepted by
the -D option to many other cvs commands (see node Common
options&rsquo; in the CVS manual). Dates can be combined
into ranges as follows:</p>

<p>d1&lt;d2</p>

<p>d2&gt;d1</p>

<p>Select the revisions that were deposited between d1 and
d2.</p>

<p>&lt;d</p>

<p>d&gt;</p>

<p>Select all revisions dated d or earlier.</p>

<p>d&lt;</p>

<p>&gt;d</p>

<p>Select all revisions dated d or later.</p>

<p>d</p>

<p>Select the single, latest revision dated d or
earlier.</p>

<p>The &gt; or &lt; characters may be followed by = to
indicate an inclusive range rather than an exclusive
one.</p>

<p>Note that the separator is a semicolon (;).</p>

<p>-h</p>

<p>Print only the name of the rcs file, name of the file in
the working directory, head, default branch, access list,
locks, symbolic names, and suffix.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory. (Default
is to run recursively).</p>

<p>-N</p>

<p>Do not print the list of tags for this file. This option
can be very useful when your site uses a lot of tags, so
rather than &quot;more&quot;&rsquo;ing over 3 pages of tag
information, the log information is presented without tags
at all.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>Print the list of tags for this file. This option can be
very useful when your .cvsrc file has a log -N entry as a
way to get a full list of all of the tags.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Print only the name of the rcs file.</p>

<p>-rrevisions</p>

<p>Print information about revisions given in the
comma-separated list revisions of revisions and ranges. The
following table explains the available range formats:</p>

<p>rev1:rev2</p>

<p>Revisions rev1 to rev2 (which must be on the same
branch).</p>

<p>rev1::rev2</p>

<p>The same, but excluding rev1.</p>

<p>:rev</p>

<p>::rev</p>

<p>Revisions from the beginning of the branch up to and
including rev.</p>

<p>rev:</p>

<p>Revisions starting with rev to the end of the branch
containing rev.</p>

<p>rev::</p>

<p>Revisions starting just after rev to the end of the
branch contain- ing rev.</p>

<p>branch</p>

<p>An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that
branch.</p>

<p>branch1:branch2</p>

<p>branch1::branch2</p>

<p>A range of branches means all revisions on the branches
in that range.</p>

<p>branch.</p>

<p>The latest revision in branch.</p>

<p>A bare -r with no revisions means the latest revision on
the default branch, normally the trunk. There can be no
space between the -r option and its argument.</p>

<p>-S</p>

<p>Suppress the header if no revisions are selected.</p>

<p>-s states</p>

<p>Print information about revisions whose state attributes
match one of the states given in the comma-separated list
states. Individual states may be any text string, though cvs
commonly only uses two states, Exp and dead. See admin
options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for more information.</p>

<p>-t</p>

<p>Print the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.</p>

<p>-wlogins</p>

<p>Print information about revisions checked in by users
with login names appearing in the comma-separated list
logins. If logins is omitted, the user&rsquo;s login is
assumed. There can be no space between the -w option and its
argument.</p>

<p>rdiff &rsquo;patch&rsquo; format diffs between releases
&middot; rdiff [-flags] [-V vn] [-r t|-D d [-r t2|-D d2]]
modules...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: nothing.</p>

<p>&middot; Synonym: patch</p>

<p>Builds a Larry Wall format patch(1) file between two
releases, that can be fed directly into the patch program to
bring an old release up-to-date with the new release. (This
is one of the few cvs com- mands that operates directly from
the repository, and doesn&rsquo;t require a prior checkout.)
The diff output is sent to the standard output device.</p>

<p>You can specify (using the standard -r and -D options)
any combina- tion of one or two revisions or dates. If only
one revision or date is specified, the patch file reflects
differences between that revi- sion or date and the current
head revisions in the rcs file.</p>

<p>Note that if the software release affected is contained
in more than one directory, then it may be necessary to
specify the -p option to the patch command when patching the
old sources, so that patch is able to find the files that
are located in other directories.</p>

<p>rdiff options These standard options are supported by
rdiff (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for
a complete description of them):</p>

<p>-D date</p>

<p>Use the most recent revision no later than date.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most
recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).</p>

<p>-k kflag</p>

<p>Process keywords according to kflag. See Keyword
substitution&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; don&rsquo;t descend subdirectories.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Examine directories recursively. This option is on by
default.</p>

<p>-r tag</p>

<p>Use revision tag.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, these options are
available:</p>

<p>-c</p>

<p>Use the context diff format. This is the default
format.</p>

<p>-s</p>

<p>Create a summary change report instead of a patch. The
summary includes information about files that were changed
or added between the releases. It is sent to the standard
output device. This is useful for finding out, for example,
which files have changed between two dates or revisions.</p>

<p>-t</p>

<p>A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard
output device. This is most useful for seeing what the last
change to a file was.</p>

<p>-u</p>

<p>Use the unidiff format for the context diffs. Remember
that old ver- sions of the patch program can&rsquo;t handle
the unidiff format, so if you plan to post this patch to the
net you should probably not use -u.</p>

<p>-V vn</p>

<p>Expand keywords according to the rules current in rcs
version vn (the expansion format changed with rcs version
5). Note that this option is no longer accepted. cvs will
always expand keywords the way that rcs version 5 does.</p>

<p>rdiff examples Suppose you receive mail from
foo@example.net asking for an update from release 1.2 to 1.4
of the tc compiler. You have no such patches on hand, but
with cvs that can easily be fixed with a command such as
this:</p>

<p>$ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | &gt; Mail -s
&rsquo;The patches you asked for&rsquo; foo@example.net</p>

<p>Suppose you have made release 1.3, and forked a branch
called R_1_3fix for bug fixes. R_1_3_1 corresponds to
release 1.3.1, which was made some time ago. Now, you want
to see how much development has been done on the branch.
This command can be used:</p>

<p>$ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name cvs
rdiff: Diffing module-name File ChangeLog,v changed from
revision 1.52.2.5 to 1.52.2.6 File foo.c,v changed from
revision 1.52.2.3 to 1.52.2.4 File bar.h,v changed from
revision 1.29.2.1 to 1.2</p>

<p>release Indicate that a Module is no longer in use
&middot; release [-d] directories...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: Working directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: Working directory, history log.</p>

<p>This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of cvs
checkout. Since cvs doesn&rsquo;t lock files, it isn&rsquo;t
strictly necessary to use this command. You can always
simply delete your working directory, if you like; but you
risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you leave no
trace in the cvs history file (see node history file&rsquo;
in the CVS manual) that you&rsquo;ve abandoned your
checkout.</p>

<p>Use cvs release to avoid these problems. This command
checks that no uncommitted changes are present; that you are
executing it from imme- diately above a cvs working
directory; and that the repository recorded for your files
is the same as the repository defined in the module
database.</p>

<p>If all these conditions are true, cvs release leaves a
record of its execution (attesting to your intentionally
abandoning your checkout) in the cvs history log.</p>

<p>release options The release command supports one command
option:</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>Delete your working copy of the file if the release
succeeds. If this flag is not given your files will remain
in your working direc- tory.</p>

<p>WARNING: The release command deletes all directories and
files recursively. This has the very serious side-effect
that any direc- tory created inside checked-out sources, and
not added to the reposi- tory (using the add command; see
nodeAdding files&rsquo; in the CVS man- ual) will be
silently deleteeven if it is non-empty!</p>

<p>release output Before release releases your sources it
will print a one-line message for any file that is not
up-to-date.</p>

<p>U file</p>

<p>P file</p>

<p>There exists a newer revision of this file in the
repository, and you have not modified your local copy of the
file (U and P mean the same thing).</p>

<p>A file</p>

<p>The file has been added to your private copy of the
sources, but has not yet been committed to the repository.
If you delete your copy of the sources this file will be
lost.</p>

<p>R file</p>

<p>The file has been removed from your private copy of the
sources, but has not yet been removed from the repository,
since you have not yet committed the removal. See
commit&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>M file</p>

<p>The file is modified in your working directory. There
might also be a newer revision inside the repository.</p>

<p>? file</p>

<p>file is in your working directory, but does not
correspond to any- thing in the source repository, and is
not in the list of files for cvs to ignore (see the
description of the -I option, and see node cvsignore&rsquo;
in the CVS manual). If you remove your working sources, this
file will be lost.</p>

<p>release examples Release the tc directory, and delete
your local working copy of the files.</p>

<p>$ cd .. # You must stand immediately above the # sources
when you issue cvs release. $ cvs release -d tc You have [0]
altered files in this repository. Are you sure you want to
release (and delete) directory &lsquo;tc&rsquo;: y $</p>

<p>remove Remove files from active use &middot; Synopsis:
remove [-flR] [files...]</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository, working directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: working directory.</p>

<p>The remove command is used to remove unwanted files from
active use. The user normally deletes the files from the
working directory prior to invocation of the remove command.
Only the working directory is updated. Changes to the
repository are not made until the commit command is run.</p>

<p>The remove command does not delete files from from the
repository. cvs keeps all historical data in the repository
so that it is possi- ble to reconstruct previous states of
the projects under revision control.</p>

<p>To undo cvs remove or to resurrect files that were
previously removed, see node add&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>remove options These standard options are supported by
remove (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for
a complete description of them):</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory. See
Recursive behav- ior&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Process directories recursively. See Recursive
behavior&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>In addition, these options are also supported:</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>Note that this is not the standard behavior of the -f
option as defined in Common options&rsquo; in the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>Delete files before removing them.</p>

<p>Entire directory hierarchies are easily removed using
-f, but take note that it is not as easy to resurrect
directory hierarchies as it is to remove them.</p>

<p>remove examples Removing a file $ cvs remove remove.me
cvs remove: file &lsquo;remove.me&rsquo; still in working
directory cvs remove: 1 file exists; remove it first $ rm -f
remove.me $ cvs remove remove.me cvs remove: scheduling
&lsquo;remove.me&rsquo; for removal cvs remove: use
&rsquo;cvs commit&rsquo; to remove this file permanently</p>

<p>$ ls remove.it remove.it $ cvs remove -f remove.it cvs
remove: scheduling &lsquo;remove.it&rsquo; for removal cvs
remove: use &rsquo;cvs commit&rsquo; to remove this file
permanently</p>

<p>Removing entire directories $ tree -d a a |-- CVS
&lsquo;-- b &lsquo;-- CVS</p>

<p>3 directories $ cvs remove -f a cvs remove: Removing a
cvs remove: Removing a/b cvs remove: scheduling
&lsquo;a/b/c&rsquo; for removal cvs remove: use &rsquo;cvs
commit&rsquo; to remove this file permanently</p>

<p>update Bring work tree in sync with repository &middot;
update [-ACdflPpR] [-I name] [-j rev [-j rev]] [-k kflag]
[-r tag|-D date] [-W spec] files...</p>

<p>&middot; Requires: repository, working directory.</p>

<p>&middot; Changes: working directory.</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve run checkout to create your private
copy of source from the common repository, other developers
will continue changing the central source. From time to
time, when it is convenient in your development process, you
can use the update command from within your working
directory to reconcile your work with any revisions applied
to the source repository since your last checkout or
update.</p>

<p>update options These standard options are available with
update (see node Common options&rsquo; in the CVS manual for
a complete description of them):</p>

<p>-D date</p>

<p>Use the most recent revision no later than date. This
option is sticky, and implies -P. See Sticky tags&rsquo; in
the CVS manual for more information on sticky
tags/dates.</p>

<p>-f</p>

<p>Only useful with the -D date or -r tag flags. If no
matching revi- sion is found, retrieve the most recent
revision (instead of ignoring the file).</p>

<p>-k kflag</p>

<p>Process keywords according to kflag. See Keyword
substitution&rsquo; in the CVS manual. This option is
sticky; future updates of this file in this working
directory will use the same kflag. The status com- mand can
be viewed to see the sticky options. See Invoking CVS&rsquo;
in the CVS manual for more information on the status
command.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>Local; run only in current working directory. See
Recursive behav- ior&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-P</p>

<p>Prune empty directories. See Moving directories&rsquo;
in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-p</p>

<p>Pipe files to the standard output.</p>

<p>-R</p>

<p>Update directories recursively (default). See Recursive
behavior&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-r rev</p>

<p>Retrieve revision/tag rev. This option is sticky, and
implies -P. See Sticky tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual, for
more information on sticky tags/dates.</p>

<p>These special options are also available with
update.</p>

<p>-A</p>

<p>Reset any sticky tags, dates, or -k options. Does not
reset sticky -k options on modified files. See Sticky
tags&rsquo; in the CVS manual for more information on sticky
tags/dates.</p>

<p>-C</p>

<p>Overwrite locally modified files with clean copies from
the reposi- tory (the modified file is saved in
.#file.revision, however).</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>Create any directories that exist in the repository if
they&rsquo;re miss- ing from the working directory.
Normally, update acts only on direc- tories and files that
were already enrolled in your working direc- tory.</p>

<p>This is useful for updating directories that were
created in the repository since the initial checkout; but it
has an unfortunate side effect. If you deliberately avoided
certain directories in the repository when you created your
working directory (either through use of a module name or by
listing explicitly the files and directo- ries you wanted on
the command line), then updating with -d will cre- ate those
directories, which may not be what you want.</p>

<p>-I name</p>

<p>Ignore files whose names match name (in your working
directory) dur- ing the update. You can specify -I more than
once on the command line to specify several files to ignore.
Use -I ! to avoid ignoring any files at all. See
cvsignore&rsquo; in the CVS manual for other ways to make
cvs ignore some files.</p>

<p>-Wspec</p>

<p>Specify file names that should be filtered during
update. You can use this option repeatedly.</p>

<p>spec can be a file name pattern of the same type that
you can specify in the .cvswrappers file. See
Wrappers&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>-jrevision</p>

<p>With two -j options, merge changes from the revision
specified with the first -j option to the revision specified
with the second j option, into the working directory.</p>

<p>With one -j option, merge changes from the ancestor
revision to the revision specified with the -j option, into
the working directory. The ancestor revision is the common
ancestor of the revision which the working directory is
based on, and the revision specified in the -j option.</p>

<p>Note that using a single -j tagname option rather than
-j branchname to merge changes from a branch will often not
remove files which were removed on the branch. See Merging
adds and removals&rsquo; in the CVS manual for more
information.</p>

<p>In addition, each -j option can contain an optional date
specifica- tion which, when used with branches, can limit
the chosen revision to one within a specific date. An
optional date is specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag:
-jSymbolic_Tag:Date_Specifier.</p>

<p>See Branching and merging&rsquo; in the CVS manual.</p>

<p>update output update and checkout keep you informed of
their progress by printing a line for each file, preceded by
one character indicating the status of the file:</p>

<p>U file</p>

<p>The file was brought up to date with respect to the
repository. This is done for any file that exists in the
repository but not in your working directory, and for files
that you haven&rsquo;t changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.</p>

<p>P file</p>

<p>Like U, but the cvs server sends a patch instead of an
entire file. This accomplishes the same thing as U using
less bandwidth.</p>

<p>A file</p>

<p>The file has been added to your private copy of the
sources, and will be added to the source repository when you
run commit on the file. This is a reminder to you that the
file needs to be committed.</p>

<p>R file</p>

<p>The file has been removed from your private copy of the
sources, and will be removed from the source repository when
you run commit on the file. This is a reminder to you that
the file needs to be committed.</p>

<p>M file</p>

<p>The file is modified in your working directory.</p>

<p>M can indicate one of two states for a file you&rsquo;re
working on: either there were no modifications to the same
file in the repository, so that your file remains as you
last saw it; or there were modifica- tions in the repository
as well as in your copy, but they were merged successfully,
without conflict, in your working directory.</p>

<p>cvs will print some messages if it merges your work, and
a backup copy of your working file (as it looked before you
ran update) will be made. The exact name of that file is
printed while update runs.</p>

<p>C file</p>

<p>A conflict was detected while trying to merge your
changes to file with changes from the source repository.
file (the copy in your working directory) is now the result
of attempting to merge the two revisions; an unmodified copy
of your file is also in your working directory, with the
name .#file.revision where revision is the revi- sion that
your modified file started from. Resolve the conflict as
described in Conflicts example&rsquo; in the CVS manual.
(Note that some systems automatically purge files that begin
with .# if they have not been accessed for a few days. If
you intend to keep a copy of your original file, it is a
very good idea to rename it.) Under vms, the file name
starts with __ rather than .#.</p>

<p>? file</p>

<p>file is in your working directory, but does not
correspond to any- thing in the source repository, and is
not in the list of files for cvs to ignore (see the
description of the -I option, and see node cvsignore&rsquo;
in the CVS manual).</p>
