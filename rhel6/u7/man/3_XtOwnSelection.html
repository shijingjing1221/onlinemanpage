<p>XtOwnSelection(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtOwnSelection(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtOwnSelection, XtOwnSelectionIncremental,
XtDisownSelection - set selection owner</p>

<p>SYNTAX Boolean XtOwnSelection(Widget w, Atom selection,
Time time, XtConvertS- electionProc convert_proc,
XtLoseSelectionProc lose_selection, XtSelectionDoneProc
done_proc);</p>

<p>Boolean XtOwnSelectionIncremental(Widget w, Atom
selection, Time time, XtConvertSelectionIncrProc
convert_callback, XtLoseSelectionIn- crProc lose_callback,
XtSelectionDoneIncrProc done_callback,
XtCancelConvertSelectionProc cancel_callback, XtPointer
client_data);</p>

<p>void XtDisownSelection(Widget w, Atom selection, Time
time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS convert_proc Specifies the procedure that is
to be called whenever someone requests the current value of
the selection.</p>

<p>done_proc Specifies the procedure that is called after
the requestor has received the selection or NULL if the
owner is not inter- ested in being called back.</p>

<p>lose_selection Specifies the procedure that is to be
called whenever the widget has lost selection ownership or
NULL if the owner is not interested in being called
back.</p>

<p>selection Specifies an atom that describes the type of
the selection (for example, XA_PRIMARY, XA_SECONDARY, or
XA_CLIPBOARD).</p>

<p>time Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the
selection ownership should commence or is to be
relinquished.</p>

<p>w Specifies the widget that wishes to become the owner
or to relinquish ownership.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtOwnSelection function informs the
Intrinsics selection mechanism that a widget believes it
owns a selection. It returns True if the widget has
successfully become the owner and False otherwise. The wid-
get may fail to become the owner if some other widget has
asserted own- ership at a time later than this widget. Note
that widgets can lose selection ownership either because
someone else asserted later owner- ship of the selection or
because the widget voluntarily gave up owner- ship of the
selection. Also note that the lose_selection procedure is
not called if the widget fails to obtain selection ownership
in the first place.</p>

<p>The XtOwnSelectionIncremental procedure informs the
Intrinsics incre- mental selection mechanism that the
specified widget wishes to own the selection. It returns
True if the specified widget successfully becomes the
selection owner or False otherwise. For more information
about selection, target, and time, see Section 2.6 of the
Inter-Client Commu- nication Conventions Manual.</p>

<p>A widget that becomes the selection owner using
XtOwnSelection- Incremental may use XtDisownSelection to
relinquish selection owner- ship.</p>

<p>The XtDisownSelection function informs the Intrinsics
selection mecha- nism that the specified widget is to lose
ownership of the selection. If the widget does not currently
own the selection either because it lost the selection or
because it never had the selection to begin with,
XtDisownSelection does nothing.</p>

<p>After a widget has called XtDisownSelection, its convert
procedure is not called even if a request arrives later with
a timestamp during the period that this widget owned the
selection. However, its done proce- dure will be called if a
conversion that started before the call to XtDisownSelection
finishes after the call to XtDisownSelection.</p>
