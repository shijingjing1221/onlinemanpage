<p>BTRECORD(8) BTRECORD(8)</p>

<p>NAME btrecord - recreate IO loads recorded by
blktrace</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Usage:</p>

<p>btrecord [ options ] &lt;dev...&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The btrecord and btreplay tools provide the
ability to record and replay IOs captured by the blktrace
utility. Attempts are made to main- tain ordering, CPU
mappings and time-separation of IOs.</p>

<p>The blktrace utility provides the ability to collect
detailed traces from the kernel for each IO processed by the
block IO layer. The traces provide a complete timeline for
each IO processed, including detailed information concerning
when an IO was first received by the block IO layer
indicating the device, CPU number, time stamp, IO direction,
sector number and IO size (number of sectors). Using this
information, one is able to replay the IO again on the same
machine or another set up entirely.</p>

<p>The basic operating work-flow to replay IOs would be
something like:</p>

<p>- Run blktrace to collect traces. Here you specify the
device or devices that you wish to trace and later replay
IOs upon. Note: the only traces you are interested in are
QUEUE requests thus, to save system resources (including
storage for traces), one could specify the -a queue command
line option to blktrace.</p>

<p>- While blktrace is running, you run the workload that
you are interested in.</p>

<p>- When the work load has completed, you stop the
blktrace utility (thus saving all traces over the complete
workload).</p>

<p>- You extract the pertinent IO information from the
traces saved by blktrace using the btrecord utility. This
will parse each trace file created by blktrace, and crafty
IO descriptions to be used in the next phase of the workload
processing.</p>

<p>- Once btrecord has successfully created a series of
data files to be processed, you can run the btreplay utility
which attempts to generate the same IOs seen during the
sample workload phase.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d &lt;dir&gt; --input-directory=&lt;dir&gt; Set
input directory. This option requires a single parameter
providing the directory name for where input files are to be
found. The default directory is the current directory
(.).</p>

<p>-D &lt;dir&gt; --output-directory=&lt;dir&gt; Set output
directory. This option requires a single parameter providing
the directory name for where output files are to be found.
The default directory is the current directory (.).</p>

<p>-F --find-traces Find trace files automatically This
option instructs btreplay to go find all the trace files in
the directory specified (either via the -d option, or in the
default directory (.).</p>

<p>-h --help Show help and exit.</p>

<p>-V --version Show version number and exit.</p>

<p>-m &lt;nanoseconds&gt;
--max-bunch-time=&lt;nanoseconds&gt; The -m option requires
a single parameter which specifies an amount of time (in
nanoseconds) to include in any one bunch of IOs that are to
be processed. The smaller the value, the smaller the number
of IOs processed at one time perhaps yielding in more
realistic replay. However, after a certain point the amount
of overhead per bunch may result in additional real replay
time, thus yielding less accurate replay times.</p>

<p>The default value is 10,000,000 nanoseconds (10
milliseconds).</p>

<p>-M &lt;num&gt; --max-pkts=&lt;num&gt; Set maximum number
of packets per bunch. The -M option requires a single
parameter which specifies the maximum number of IOs to store
in a single bunch. As with the -m option, smaller values may
or may not yield more accurate replay times.</p>

<p>The default value is 8, with a maximum value of up to
512 being supported.</p>

<p>-o &lt;basename&gt; --output-base=&lt;basename&gt; Set
base name for output files. Each output file has 3
fields:</p>

<p>1. Device identifier (taken directly from the device
name of the blktrace output file).</p>

<p>2. btrecord base name by default replay.</p>

<p>3. The CPU number (again, taken directly from the
blktrace output file name).</p>

<p>This option requires a single parameter that will
override the default name (replay), and replace it with the
specified value.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose output. This option will
output some simple statistics at the end of a successful
run. Example output is:</p>

<p>sdab:0: 580661 pkts (tot), 126030 pkts (replay), 89809
bunches, 1.4 pkts/bunch sdab:1: 2559775 pkts (tot), 430172
pkts (replay), 293029 bunches, 1.5 pkts/bunch sdab:2: 653559
pkts (tot), 136522 pkts (replay), 102288 bunches, 1.3
pkts/bunch sdab:3: 474773 pkts (tot), 117849 pkts (replay),
69572 bunches, 1.7 pkts/bunch</p>

<p>The meaning of the columns is:</p>

<p>1. The first field contains the device name and CPU
identi- fier. Thus: sdab:0: means the device sdab and traces
on CPU 0.</p>

<p>2. The second field contains the total number of packets
pro- cessed for each device file.</p>

<p>3. The next field shows the number of packets eligible
for replay.</p>

<p>4. The fourth field contains the total number of IO
bunches.</p>

<p>5. The last field shows the average number of IOs per
bunch recorded.</p>
