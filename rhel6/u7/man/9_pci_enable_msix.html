<p>SYNOPSIS int pci_enable_msix(struct pci_dev * dev,
struct msix_entry * entries, int nvec);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS dev pointer to the pci_dev data structure of
MSI-X device function</p>

<p>entries pointer to an array of MSI-X entries</p>

<p>nvec number of MSI-X irqs requested for allocation by
device driver</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Setup the MSI-X capability structure of
device function with the number of requested irqs upon its
software driver call to request for MSI-X mode enabled on
its hardware device function. A return of zero indicates the
successful configuration of MSI-X capability structure with
new allocated MSI-X irqs. A return of &lt; 0 indicates a
