<p>NAME pnmtofiasco - Convert PNM file to FIASCO compressed
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmtofiasco [option]... [filename]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtofiasco compresses the named pbm, pgm, or ppm image
files, or Stan- dard Input if no file is named, and produces
a FIASCO file on Standard Output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All option names may be abbreviated; for
example, --optimize may be written --optim or --opt. For
most options a one letter short option is provided.
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are manda-
tory or optional for short options, too. Both short and long
options are case sensitive.</p>

<p>The basic options are:</p>

<p>-i name, --input-name=name Compress the named images,
not Standard Input. If name is -, read Standard Input. name
has to be either an image filename or a template of the
form:</p>

<p>prefix[start-end{+,-}step]suffix</p>

<p>Templates are useful when compressing video streams:
e.g., if you specify the template img0[12-01-2].pgm, then
pnmtofiasco compresses the images img012.pgm, img010.pgm,
..., img002.pgm.</p>

<p>If name is a relative path, pnmtofiasco searches for the
image files in the current directory and in the
(colon-separated) list of directories given by the
environment variable FIASCO_IMAGES.</p>

<p>-o output-file, --output-name=name Write FIASCO output
to the named file, not to Standard Output.</p>

<p>If name is a relative path and the environment variable
FIASCO_DATA is a (colon-separated) list of directories, then
pnmtofiasco writes the output file to the first (writable)
directory of this list. Otherwise, pnmtofiasco write it to
the current directory.</p>

<p>-q N, --quality=N Set quality of compression to N.
Quality is 1 (worst) to 100 (best); default is 20.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print pnmtofiasco version number, then
exit.</p>

<p>-V N, --verbose N Set level of verbosity to N. Level is
0 (no output at all), 1 (show progress meter), or 2 (show
detailed compression statis- tics); default is 1.</p>

<p>-B N, --progress-meter N Set type of progress-meter to
N. The following types are avail- able; default is 1:</p>

<p>0 no progress meter</p>

<p>1 RPM style progress bar using 50 hash marks</p>

<p>2 percentage meter</p>

<p>-f name, --config=name Load parameter file name to
initialize the options of pnmtofi- asco. See file
system.fiascorc for an example of the syntax. Options of
pnmtofiasco are set by any of the following methods (in the
specified order):</p>

<p>&middot; Global resource file /etc/system.fiascorc</p>

<p>&middot; $HOME/.fiascorc</p>

<p>&middot; command line</p>

<p>&middot; --config=name</p>

<p>-h, --info Print brief help, then exit.</p>

<p>-H, --help Print detailed help, then exit.</p>

<p>The options for advanced users are:</p>

<p>-b name, --basis-name=name Preload compression basis
name into FIASCO. The basis name pro- vides the initial
compression dictionary. Either use one of the files
small.fco, medium.fco, or large.fco that come with
pnmtofiasco or create a new ASCII basis file.</p>

<p>-z N, --optimize=N Set optimization level to N. Level is
0 (fastest) to 3 (slow- est); default is 1. Be warned, the
encoding time dramatically increased when N=2 or N=3 while
the compression performance only slightly improves.</p>

<p>-P, --prediction Use additional predictive coding. If
this optimization is enabled then the image is compressed in
two steps. In the first step, a coarse approximation of the
image is computed using large unichrome blocks. Finally, the
delta image is computed and the prediction error is
approximated using the standard FIASCO algorithm.</p>

<p>-D N, --dictionary-size=N Set size of dictionary that is
used when coding the luminance band to N; default is 10000,
i.e., the dictionary is not restricted.</p>

<p>-C N, --chroma-dictionary=N Set size of dictionary that
is used when coding chroma bands to N; default is 40.</p>

<p>-Q N, --chroma-qfactor=N Reduce the quality of chroma
band compression N-times with respect to the user defined
quality q of the luminance band com- pression (--quality=q);
default is 2.</p>

<p>-t N, --tiling-exponent=N Subdivide the image into 2^N
tiles prior coding; default is 4, i.e. the image is
subdivided into 16 tiles. The processing order of the
individual tiles is defined by the option --tiling-
method=name.</p>

<p>-T name, --tiling-method=name Order the individual image
tiles (the image is subdivided into; see option
--tiling-exponent=N) by method name; default is desc-
variance.</p>

<p>desc-variance Tiles with small variances are processed
first.</p>

<p>asc-variance Tiles with large variances are processed
first.</p>

<p>desc-spiral Tiles are process in spiral order starting
in the middle.</p>

<p>asc-spiral Tiles are process in spiral order starting at
the border.</p>

<p>--rpf-mantissa=N Use N mantissa bits for quantized
coefficients.</p>

<p>--dc-rpf-mantissa=N Use N mantissa bits for quantized DC
coefficients.</p>

<p>--rpf-range=N Coefficients outside the quantization
interval [-N,+N] are set to zero.</p>

<p>--dc-rpf-range=N DC coefficients outside the
quantization interval [-N,+N] are set to zero.</p>

<p>Additional options for video compression are</p>

<p>-s N, --smooth=N Smooth decompressed reference frames
along the partitioning bor- ders by the given amount N. N is
0 (no smoothing) to 100; default is 70. This factor is
stored in the FIASCO file.</p>

<p>-m N, --min-level=N Start prediction (motion compensated
prediction or additional prediction) on block level N;
default is level 6. I.e., motion compensation is applied to
all image blocks of at least 8x8 pix- els (binary tree level
N=6), 16x8 (N=7), 16x16 (N=8), etc.</p>

<p>-M N, --max-level=N Stop prediction (motion compensated
prediction or additional prediction) on block level N;
default is level 10. I.e., motion compensation is applied to
all image blocks of at most 16x16 pixels (N=8), 32x16 (N=9),
32x32 (N=10), etc.</p>

<p>-2, --half-pixel Use half pixel precise motion
compensation.</p>

<p>-F N, --fps=N Set number of frames per second to N. This
value is stored in the FIASCO output file and is used in the
decoder fiasco- topnm(1)tocontroltheframerate.</p>

<p>-p type, --pattern=type Defines the type of inter frame
compression which should be applied to individual frames of
a video stream. type is a sequence of characters; default is
IPPPPPPPPP . Element N defines the type of predicting which
should be used for frame N; the frame type pattern is
periodically extended. Valid charac- ters are:</p>

<p>I intra frame, i.e., no motion compensated prediction is
used at all.</p>

<p>P predicted frame, i.e., a previously encoded frame is
used for prediction (forward prediction).</p>

<p>B bidirectional predicted frame, i.e., not only a
previously shown frame but also a frame of the future is
used for prediction (forward, backward or interpolated
prediction).</p>

<p>--cross-B-search Instead of using exhaustive search the
Cross-B-Search algo- rithm is used to find the best
interpolated prediction of B- frames.</p>

<p>--B-as-past-ref Also use previously encoded B-frames
when prediction the current frame. If this option is not
set, only I- and P-frames are used to predict the current
frame.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Compress the still image foo.ppm to the FIASCO
file foo.wfa using the default options:</p>

<p>pnmtofiasco &lt; foo.ppm &gt;foo.wfa</p>

<p>Compress the video frames foo0*.ppm to the FIASCO file
video.wfa using half pixel precise motion compensation at a
frame rate of 15 frames per second. Intra frame 1 is used to
predict P-frame 4, frames 1 and 4 are used to predict
B-frames 2 and 3, and so on. Frame 10 is again an
intra-frame.</p>

<p>pnmtofiasco -2 -p IBBPBBPBB -fps 15 -o video.wfa
foo0*.ppm</p>

<p>FILES /etc/system.fiascorc The systemwide initialization
file.</p>

<p>$HOME/.fiascorc The personal initialization file.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT FIASCO_IMAGES Search path for image files.
Default is ./.</p>

<p>FIASCO_DATA Search and save path for FIASCO files.
Default is ./.</p>
