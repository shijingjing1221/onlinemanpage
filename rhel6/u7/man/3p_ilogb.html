<p>ILOGB(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ILOGB(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ilogb, ilogbf, ilogbl - return an unbiased
exponent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ilogb(double x); int ilogbf(float x); int
ilogbl(long double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall return the exponent
part of their argument x. Formally, the return value is the
integral part of log_r|x| as a signed integral value, for
non-zero x, where r is the radix of the machines
floating-point arithmetic, which is the value of FLT_RADIX
defined in &lt;float.h&gt;.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the exponent part of x as a signed integer
value. They are equivalent to calling the corresponding
logb() function and casting the returned value to type
int.</p>

<p>If x is 0, a domain error shall occur, and the value
FP_ILOGB0 shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is &plusmn;Inf, a domain error shall occur, and the
value {INT_MAX} shall be returned.</p>

<p>If x is a NaN, a domain error shall occur, and the value
FP_ILOGBNAN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the correct value is greater than {INT_MAX},
{INT_MAX} shall be returned and a domain error shall
occur.</p>

<p>If the correct value is less than {INT_MIN}, {INT_MIN}
shall be returned and a domain error shall occur.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>Domain Error The x argument is zero, NaN, or
&plusmn;Inf, or the correct value is not representable as an
integer.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].
If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On error, the expressions
(math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
&amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at
least one of them must be non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The errors come from taking the expected
floating-point value and con- verting it to int, which is an
invalid operation in IEEE Std 754-1985 (since overflow,
infinity, and NaN are not representable in a type int), so
should be a domain error.</p>

<p>There are no known implementations that overflow. For
overflow to hap- pen, {INT_MAX} must be less than
LDBL_MAX_EXP*log2(FLT_RADIX) or {INT_MIN} must be greater
than LDBL_MIN_EXP*log2(FLT_RADIX) if subnor- mals are not
supported, or {INT_MIN} must be greater than
(LDBL_MIN_EXP-LDBL_MANT_DIG)*log2(FLT_RADIX) if subnormals
are sup- ported.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
