<p>NAME vfs_fake_perms - enable read only Roaming
Profiles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = fake_perms</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_fake_perms VFS module was created to allow
Roaming Profile files and directories to be set (on the
Samba server under UNIX) as read only. This module will, if
installed on the Profiles share, report to the client that
the Profile files and directories are writeable. This
satisfies the client even though the files will never be
overwritten as the client logs out or shuts down.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES [Profiles] path = /profiles vfs objects =
fake_perms</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
