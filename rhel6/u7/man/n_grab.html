<p>grab(n) Tk Built-In Commands grab(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME grab - Confine pointer and keyboard events to a
window sub-tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grab ?-global? window</p>

<p>grab option ?arg arg ...?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command implements simple pointer and
keyboard grabs for Tk. Tks grabs are different than the
grabs described in the Xlib documentation. When a grab is
set for a particular window, Tk restricts all pointer events
to the grab window and its descendants in Tks window
hierarchy. Whenever the pointer is within the grab windows
subtree, the pointer will behave exactly the same as if
there had been no grab at all and all events will be
reported in the normal fashion. When the pointer is outside
window s tree, button presses and releases and mouse motion
events are reported to window, and window entry and window
exit events are ignored. The grab subtree owns the pointer:
windows outside the grab subtree will be visible on the
screen but they will be insensitive until the grab is
released. The tree of windows underneath the grab window can
include top-level windows, in which case all of those top-
level windows and their descendants will continue to receive
mouse events during the grab.</p>

<p>Two forms of grabs are possible: local and global. A
local grab affects only the grabbing application: events
will be reported to other applications as if the grab had
never occurred. Grabs are local by default. A global grab
locks out all applications on the screen, so that only the
given subtree of the grabbing application will be sensi-
tive to pointer events (mouse button presses, mouse button
releases, pointer motions, window entries, and window
exits). During global grabs the window manager will not
receive pointer events either.</p>

<p>During local grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key
releases) are delivered as usual: the window manager
controls which application receives keyboard events, and if
they are sent to any window in the grabbing application then
they are redirected to the focus window. During a global
grab Tk grabs the keyboard so that all keyboard events are
always sent to the grabbing application. The focus command
is still used to determine which window in the application
receives the keyboard events. The keyboard grab is released
when the grab is released.</p>

<p>Grabs apply to particular displays. If an application
has windows on multiple displays then it can establish a
separate grab on each dis- play. The grab on a particular
display affects only the windows on that display. It is
possible for different applications on a single display to
have simultaneous local grabs, but only one application can
have a global grab on a given display at once.</p>

<p>The grab command can take any of the following
forms:</p>

<p>grab ?-global? window Same as grab set, described
below.</p>

<p>grab current ?window? If window is specified, returns
the name of the current grab window in this application for
window s display, or an empty string if there is no such
window. If window is omitted, the command returns a list
whose elements are all of the windows grabbed by this
application for all displays, or an empty string if the
application has no grabs.</p>

<p>grab release window Releases the grab on window if there
is one, otherwise does nothing. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p>grab set ?-global? window Sets a grab on window. If
-global is specified then the grab is global, otherwise it
is local. If a grab was already in effect for this
application on windows display then it is automati- cally
released. If there is already a grab on window and it has
the same global/local form as the requested grab, then the
com- mand does nothing. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p>grab status window Returns none if no grab is currently
set on window, local if a local grab is set on window, and
global if a global grab is set.</p>

<p>WARNING It is very easy to use global grabs to render a
display completely unusable (e.g. by setting a grab on a
widget which does not respond to events and not providing
any mechanism for releasing the grab). Take extreme care
when using them!</p>

<p>BUGS It took an incredibly complex and gross
implementation to produce the simple grab effect described
above. Given the current implementation, it is not safe for
applications to use the Xlib grab facilities at all except
through the Tk grab procedures. If applications try to
manipu- late X s grab mechanisms directly, things will
probably break.</p>

<p>If a single process is managing several different Tk
applications, only one of those applications can have a
local grab for a given display at any given time. If the
applications are in different processes, this restriction
does not exist.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Set a grab so that only one button may be
clicked out of a group. The other buttons are unresponsive
to the mouse until the middle button is clicked. pack
[button .b1 -text &quot;Click me! #1&quot; -command {destroy
.b1}] pack [button .b2 -text &quot;Click me! #2&quot;
-command {destroy .b2}] pack [button .b3 -text &quot;Click
me! #3&quot; -command {destroy .b3}] grab .b2</p>
