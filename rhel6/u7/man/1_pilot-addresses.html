<p>NAME pilot-addresses - Read and write address book
databases to and from a Palm handheld.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Userland conduits</p>

<p>LOCATION ./src</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-addresses [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[--version] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-q|--quiet]
[--delete-all] [-t|--delimiter INT] [-d|--delete-category
category ] [-c|--category category] [-a|--augment]
[-r|--read file] [-w|--write file ]
[-C|--human-readable]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pilot-addresses allows the user to read all
entries from a Palm hand- held such as those made by Palm,
Handspring, Handera, TRGPro, Sony or other Palm handheld in
the Palm Address Book application, write new entries into
the database, and delete a category or delete all entries in
the database.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Provide exactly one of --read or --write.</p>

<p>-r, --read=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>Reads records from &lt;file&gt; and install them to the
Palm Address Book application. (Use the -w &lt;file&gt;
option to get a sample &quot;template file&quot; for input
records to see how the fields are laid out).</p>

<p>-w, --write=file</p>

<p>Reads all address book records from the Palm Address
Book application and writes them into file</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-addresses options -a, --augment</p>

<p>Augments fields in address book records with additional
information. The augmented information is placed before and
separated from the field with a semi-colon, (;).</p>

<p>Augmented information can include any of the following
below.</p>

<p>category # Placed in front of each record or..</p>

<p>Placed in front of each phone number field:</p>


<p>[&quot;Work&quot;|&quot;Home&quot;|&quot;Fax&quot;|&quot;Other&quot;|&quot;E-mail&quot;|&quot;Main&quot;|&quot;Pager&quot;|&quot;Mobile&quot;]</p>

<p>Empty fields are not augmented.</p>

<p>-c, --category=category</p>

<p>Install records to category category by default.
Normally pilot-addresses uses the Unfiled category by
default. This option is overridden by the category specified
in the record with the -a option.</p>

<p>-d, --delete-category</p>

<p>Delete all records in the specified category category
before installing new records.</p>

<p>Note that the long name of this option has changed since
0.11.8</p>

<p>-D, --delete-all</p>

<p>Delete all address book records in all categories.
Obviously, be very careful with this one.</p>

<p>Note that the long name of this option has changed since
0.11.8</p>

<p>-t, --delimiter INT</p>

<p>Include category in each record, use the delimiter
specified to sepa- rate all fields of a record. Delimiters
are specified as follows: 3=tab, 2=;, 1=,. This overrides
the default delimiter of comma between fields and semi-colon
between a field s augmented information. (Please note that
this may generate confusing results when used with the -a
option.)</p>

<p>Note that the long name of this option has changed since
0.11.8</p>

<p>-T, --titles</p>

<p>Obsolete. This option has been removed since 0.11.8</p>

<p>Write generic human-readable output instead of CSV.</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port &lt;port&gt;</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the
Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-addresses
will look for the $PILOTPORT environment variable. If
neither are found or supplied, pilot-addresses will print
the usage information.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet</p>

<p>Suppress Hit HotSync button message</p>

<p>-v, --version</p>
