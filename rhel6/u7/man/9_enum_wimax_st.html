<p>ENUM WIMAX_ST(9) Linux Networking ENUM WIMAX_ST(9)</p>

<p>NAME enum_wimax_st - The different states of a WiMAX
device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS enum wimax_st { __WIMAX_ST_NULL, WIMAX_ST_DOWN,
__WIMAX_ST_QUIESCING, WIMAX_ST_UNINITIALIZED,
WIMAX_ST_RADIO_OFF, WIMAX_ST_READY, WIMAX_ST_SCANNING,
WIMAX_ST_CONNECTING, WIMAX_ST_CONNECTED, __WIMAX_ST_INVALID
};</p>

<p>CONSTANTS __WIMAX_ST_NULL The device structure has been
allocated and zeroed, but still wimax_dev_add hasn&acute;t
been called. There is no state.</p>

<p>WIMAX_ST_DOWN The device has been registered with the
WiMAX and networking stacks, but it is not initialized
(normally that is done with &acute;ifconfig DEV up&acute;
[or equivalent], which can upload firmware and enable
communications with the device). In this state, the device
is powered down and using as less power as possible. This
state is the default after a call to wimax_dev_add. It is ok
to have drivers move directly to WIMAX_ST_UNINITIALIZED or
WIMAX_ST_RADIO_OFF in _probe after the call to
wimax_dev_add. It is recommended that the driver leaves this
state when calling &acute;ifconfig DEV up&acute; and enters
it back on &acute;ifconfig DEV down&acute;.</p>

<p>__WIMAX_ST_QUIESCING The device is being torn down, so
no API operations are allowed to proceed except the ones
needed to complete the device clean up process.</p>

<p>WIMAX_ST_UNINITIALIZED [optional] Communication with the
device is setup, but the device still requires some
configuration before being operational. Some WiMAX API calls
might work.</p>

<p>WIMAX_ST_RADIO_OFF The device is fully up; radio is off
(wether by hardware or software switches). It is recommended
to always leave the device in this state after
initialization.</p>

<p>WIMAX_ST_READY The device is fully up and radio is
on.</p>

<p>WIMAX_ST_SCANNING [optional] The device has been
instructed to scan. In this state, the device cannot be
actively connected to a network.</p>

<p>WIMAX_ST_CONNECTING The device is connecting to a
network. This state exists because in some devices, the
connect process can include a number of negotiations between
user space, kernel space and the device. User space needs to
know what the device is doing. If the connect sequence in a
device is atomic and fast, the device can transition
directly to CONNECTED</p>

<p>WIMAX_ST_CONNECTED The device is connected to a
network.</p>

<p>__WIMAX_ST_INVALID This is an invalid state used to mark
the maximum numeric value of states.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Transitions from one state to another one
are atomic and can only be caused in kernel space with
wimax_state_change. To read the state, use
wimax_state_get.</p>

<p>States starting with __ are internal and shall not be
used or referred to by drivers or userspace. They look ugly,
but that&acute;s the point -- if any use is made
non-internal to the stack, it is easier to catch on
review.</p>

<p>All API operations [with well defined exceptions] will
take the device mutex before starting and then check the
state. If the state is __WIMAX_ST_NULL, WIMAX_ST_DOWN,
WIMAX_ST_UNINITIALIZED or __WIMAX_ST_QUIESCING, it will drop
the lock and quit with -EINVAL, -ENOMEDIUM, -ENOTCONN or
-ESHUTDOWN.</p>

<p>The order of the definitions is important, so we can do
numerical comparisons (eg: &lt; WIMAX_ST_RADIO_OFF means the
device is not ready to operate).</p>
