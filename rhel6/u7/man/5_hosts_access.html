<p>HOSTS_ACCESS(5) HOSTS_ACCESS(5)</p>

<p>NAME hosts_access - format of host access control
files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes a simple access
control language that is based on client (host name/address,
user name), and server (process name, host name/address)
patterns. Examples are given at the end. The impatient
reader is encouraged to skip to the EXAMPLES section for a
quick introduction.</p>

<p>An extended version of the access control language is
described in the hosts_options(5) document. The extensions
are turned on at program build time by building with
-DPROCESS_OPTIONS.</p>

<p>In the following text, daemon is the the process name of
a network dae- mon process, and client is the name and/or
address of a host requesting service. Network daemon process
names are specified in the inetd con- figuration file.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL FILES The access control software
consults two files. The search stops at the first match:</p>

<p>&middot; Access will be granted when a (daemon,client)
pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.allow file.</p>

<p>&middot; Otherwise, access will be denied when a
(daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.deny
file.</p>

<p>&middot; Otherwise, access will be granted.</p>

<p>A non-existing access control file is treated as if it
were an empty file. Thus, access control can be turned off
by providing no access control files.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL RULES Each access control file consists
of zero or more lines of text. These lines are processed in
order of appearance. The search terminates when a match is
found.</p>

<p>&middot; A newline character is ignored when it is
preceded by a back- slash character. This permits you to
break up long lines so that they are easier to edit.</p>

<p>&middot; Blank lines or lines that begin with a #&acute;
character are ignored. This permits you to insert comments
and whitespace so that the tables are easier to read.</p>

<p>&middot; All other lines should satisfy the following
format, things between [] being optional:</p>

<p>daemon_list : client_list [ : shell_command ]</p>

<p>daemon_list is a list of one or more daemon process
names (argv[0] val- ues) or wildcards (see below).</p>

<p>client_list is a list of one or more host names, host
addresses, pat- terns or wildcards (see below) that will be
matched against the client host name or address.</p>

<p>The more complex forms daemon@host and user@host are
explained in the sections on server endpoint patterns and on
client username lookups, respectively.</p>

<p>List elements should be separated by blanks and/or
commas.</p>

<p>With the exception of NIS (YP) netgroup lookups, all
access control checks are case insensitive.</p>

<p>PATTERNS The access control language implements the
following patterns:</p>

<p>&middot; A string that begins with a .&acute; character.
A host name is matched if the last components of its name
match the specified pattern. For example, the pattern
.tue.nl&acute; matches the host name
wzv.win.tue.nl&acute;.</p>

<p>&middot; A string that ends with a .&acute; character. A
host address is matched if its first numeric fields match
the given string. For example, the pattern 131.155.&acute;
matches the address of (almost) every host on the Eindhoven
University network (131.155.x.x).</p>

<p>&middot; A string that begins with an @&acute; character
is treated as an NIS (formerly YP) netgroup name. A host
name is matched if it is a host member of the specified
netgroup. Netgroup matches are not supported for daemon
process names or for client user names.</p>

<p>&middot; An expression of the form
n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m&acute; is interpreted as a net/mask&acute;
pair. An IPv4 host address is matched if net&acute; is equal
to the bitwise AND of the address and the mask&acute;. For
example, the net/mask pattern
131.155.72.0/255.255.254.0&acute; matches every address in
the range 131.155.72.0&acute; through
131.155.73.255&acute;.</p>

<p>&middot; An expression of the form
[n:n:n:n:n:n:n:n]/m&acute; is interpreted as a
[net]/prefixlen&acute; pair. An IPv6 host address is matched
if prefixlen&acute; bits of net&acute; is equal to the
prefixlen&acute; bits of the address. For example, the
[net]/prefixlen pattern [3ffe:505:2:1::]/64&acute; matches
every address in the range 3ffe:505:2:1::&acute; through
3ffe:505:2:1:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff&acute;.</p>

<p>&middot; A string that begins with a /&acute; character
is treated as a file name. A host name or address is matched
if it matches any host name or address pattern listed in the
named file. The file for- mat is zero or more lines with
zero or more host name or address patterns separated by
whitespace. A file name pattern can be used anywhere a host
name or address pattern can be used.</p>

<p>&middot; Wildcards *&acute; and ?&acute; can be used to
match hostnames or IP addresses. This method of matching
cannot be used in conjunc- tion with net/mask&acute;
matching, hostname matching beginning with .&acute; or IP
address matching ending with .&acute;.</p>

<p>WILDCARDS The access control language supports explicit
wildcards:</p>

<p>ALL The universal wildcard, always matches.</p>

<p>LOCAL Matches any host whose name does not contain a dot
character.</p>

<p>UNKNOWN Matches any user whose name is unknown, and
matches any host whose name or address are unknown. This
pattern should be used with care: host names may be
unavailable due to temporary name server problems. A network
address will be unavailable when the software cannot figure
out what type of network it is talking to.</p>

<p>KNOWN Matches any user whose name is known, and matches
any host whose name and address are known. This pattern
should be used with care: host names may be unavailable due
to temporary name server problems. A network address will be
unavailable when the soft- ware cannot figure out what type
of network it is talking to.</p>

<p>PARANOID Matches any host whose name does not match its
address. When tcpd is built with -DPARANOID (default mode),
it drops requests from such clients even before looking at
the access control tables. Build without -DPARANOID when you
want more control over such requests.</p>

<p>OPERATORS EXCEPT Intended use is of the form: list_1
EXCEPT list_2&acute;; this con- struct matches anything that
matches list_1 unless it matches list_2. The EXCEPT operator
can be used in daemon_lists and in client_lists. The EXCEPT
operator can be nested: if the control language would permit
the use of parentheses, a EXCEPT b EXCEPT c&acute; would
parse as (a EXCEPT (b EXCEPT c))&acute;.</p>

<p>SHELL COMMANDS If the first-matched access control rule
contains a shell command, that command is subjected to
%&lt;letter&gt; substitutions (see next section). The result
is executed by a /bin/sh child process with standard input,
output and error connected to /dev/null. Specify an
&amp;&acute; at the end of the command if you do not want to
wait until it has completed.</p>

<p>Shell commands should not rely on the PATH setting of
the inetd. Instead, they should use absolute path names, or
they should begin with an explicit PATH=whatever
statement.</p>

<p>The hosts_options(5) document describes an alternative
language that uses the shell command field in a different
and incompatible way.</p>

<p>% EXPANSIONS The following expansions are available
within shell commands:</p>

<p>%a (%A) The client (server) host address.</p>

<p>%c Client information: user@host, user@address, a host
name, or just an address, depending on how much information
is available.</p>

<p>%d The daemon process name (argv[0] value).</p>

<p>%h (%H) The client (server) host name or address, if the
host name is unavailable.</p>

<p>%n (%N) The client (server) host name (or
&quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;paranoid&quot;).</p>

<p>%p The daemon process id.</p>

<p>%s Server information: daemon@host, daemon@address, or
just a dae- mon name, depending on how much information is
available.</p>

<p>%u The client user name (or &quot;unknown&quot;).</p>

<p>%% Expands to a single %&acute; character.</p>

<p>Characters in % expansions that may confuse the shell
are replaced by underscores.</p>

<p>SERVER ENDPOINT PATTERNS In order to distinguish clients
by the network address that they con- nect to, use patterns
of the form:</p>

<p>process_name@host_pattern : client_list ...</p>

<p>Patterns like these can be used when the machine has
different internet addresses with different internet
hostnames. Service providers can use this facility to offer
FTP, GOPHER or WWW archives with internet names that may
even belong to different organizations. See also the twist
option in the hosts_options(5) document. Some systems
(Solaris, FreeBSD) can have more than one internet address
on one physical inter- face; with other systems you may have
to resort to SLIP or PPP pseudo interfaces that live in a
dedicated network address space.</p>

<p>The host_pattern obeys the same syntax rules as host
names and addresses in client_list context. Usually, server
endpoint information is available only with
connection-oriented services.</p>

<p>CLIENT USERNAME LOOKUP When the client host supports the
RFC 931 protocol or one of its descendants (TAP, IDENT, RFC
1413) the wrapper programs can retrieve additional
information about the owner of a connection. Client username
information, when available, is logged together with the
client host name, and can be used to match patterns
like:</p>

<p>daemon_list : ... user_pattern@host_pattern ...</p>

<p>The daemon wrappers can be configured at compile time to
perform rule- driven username lookups (default) or to always
interrogate the client host. In the case of rule-driven
username lookups, the above rule would cause username lookup
only when both the daemon_list and the host_pattern
match.</p>

<p>A user pattern has the same syntax as a daemon process
pattern, so the same wildcards apply (netgroup membership is
not supported). One should not get carried away with
username lookups, though.</p>

<p>&middot; The client username information cannot be
trusted when it is needed most, i.e. when the client system
has been compromised. In general, ALL and (UN)KNOWN are the
only user name patterns that make sense.</p>

<p>&middot; Username lookups are possible only with
TCP-based services, and only when the client host runs a
suitable daemon; in all other cases the result is
&quot;unknown&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; A well-known UNIX kernel bug may cause loss of
service when username lookups are blocked by a firewall. The
wrapper README document describes a procedure to find out if
your kernel has this bug.</p>

<p>&middot; Username lookups may cause noticeable delays
for non-UNIX users. The default timeout for username lookups
is 10 seconds: too short to cope with slow networks, but
long enough to irritate PC users.</p>

<p>Selective username lookups can alleviate the last
problem. For example, a rule like:</p>

<p>daemon_list : @pcnetgroup ALL@ALL</p>

<p>would match members of the pc netgroup without doing
username lookups, but would perform username lookups with
all other systems.</p>

<p>DETECTING ADDRESS SPOOFING ATTACKS A flaw in the
sequence number generator of many TCP/IP implementations
allows intruders to easily impersonate trusted hosts and to
break in via, for example, the remote shell service. The
IDENT (RFC931 etc.) service can be used to detect such and
other host address spoofing attacks.</p>

<p>Before accepting a client request, the wrappers can use
the IDENT ser- vice to find out that the client did not send
the request at all. When the client host provides IDENT
service, a negative IDENT lookup result (the client matches
UNKNOWN@host) is strong evidence of a host spoof- ing
attack.</p>

<p>A positive IDENT lookup result (the client matches
KNOWN@host) is less trustworthy. It is possible for an
intruder to spoof both the client connection and the IDENT
lookup, although doing so is much harder than spoofing just
a client connection. It may also be that the client&acute;s
IDENT server is lying.</p>

<p>Note: IDENT lookups don&acute;t work with UDP
services.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The language is flexible enough that different
types of access control policy can be expressed with a
minimum of fuss. Although the language uses two access
control tables, the most common policies can be imple-
mented with one of the tables being trivial or even
empty.</p>

<p>When reading the examples below it is important to
realize that the allow table is scanned before the deny
table, that the search termi- nates when a match is found,
and that access is granted when no match is found at
all.</p>

<p>The examples use host and domain names. They can be
improved by includ- ing address and/or network/netmask
information, to reduce the impact of temporary name server
lookup failures.</p>

<p>MOSTLY CLOSED In this case, access is denied by default.
Only explicitly authorized hosts are permitted access.</p>

<p>The default policy (no access) is implemented with a
trivial deny file:</p>

<p>/etc/hosts.deny: ALL: ALL</p>

<p>This denies all service to all hosts, unless they are
permitted access by entries in the allow file.</p>

<p>The explicitly authorized hosts are listed in the allow
file. For example:</p>

<p>/etc/hosts.allow: ALL: LOCAL @some_netgroup ALL:
.foobar.edu EXCEPT terminalserver.foobar.edu</p>

<p>The first rule permits access from hosts in the local
domain (no .&acute; in the host name) and from members of
the some_netgroup netgroup. The second rule permits access
from all hosts in the foobar.edu domain (notice the leading
dot), with the exception of terminalserver.foo- bar.edu.</p>

<p>MOSTLY OPEN Here, access is granted by default; only
explicitly specified hosts are refused service.</p>

<p>The default policy (access granted) makes the allow file
redundant so that it can be omitted. The explicitly
non-authorized hosts are listed in the deny file. For
example:</p>

<p>/etc/hosts.deny: ALL: some.host.name, .some.domain ALL
EXCEPT in.fingerd: other.host.name, .other.domain</p>

<p>The first rule denies some hosts and domains all
services; the second rule still permits finger requests from
other hosts and domains.</p>

<p>BOOBY TRAPS The next example permits tftp requests from
hosts in the local domain (notice the leading dot). Requests
from any other hosts are denied. Instead of the requested
file, a finger probe is sent to the offending host. The
result is mailed to the superuser.</p>

<p>/etc/hosts.allow: in.tftpd: LOCAL, .my.domain</p>

<p>/etc/hosts.deny: in.tftpd: ALL: spawn
(/some/where/safe_finger -l @%h | /usr/ucb/mail -s %d-%h
root) &amp;</p>

<p>The safe_finger command comes with the tcpd wrapper and
should be installed in a suitable place. It limits possible
damage from data sent by the remote finger server. It gives
better protection than the stan- dard finger command.</p>

<p>The expansion of the %h (client host) and %d (service
name) sequences is described in the section on shell
commands.</p>

<p>Warning: do not booby-trap your finger daemon, unless
you are prepared for infinite finger loops.</p>

<p>On network firewall systems this trick can be carried
even further. The typical network firewall only provides a
limited set of services to the outer world. All other
services can be &quot;bugged&quot; just like the above tftp
example. The result is an excellent early-warning
system.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS An error is reported when a syntax error is
found in a host access con- trol rule; when the length of an
access control rule exceeds the capac- ity of an internal
buffer; when an access control rule is not termi- nated by a
newline character; when the result of %&lt;letter&gt;
expansion would overflow an internal buffer; when a system
call fails that shouldn&acute;t. All problems are reported
via the syslog daemon.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts.allow, (daemon,client) pairs that are
granted access. /etc/hosts.deny, (daemon,client) pairs that
are denied access.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO tcpd(8) tcp/ip daemon wrapper program.
tcpdchk(8), tcpdmatch(8), test programs.</p>

<p>BUGS If a name server lookup times out, the host name
will not be available to the access control software, even
though the host is registered.</p>

<p>Domain name server lookups are case insensitive; NIS
(formerly YP) net- group lookups are case sensitive.</p>
