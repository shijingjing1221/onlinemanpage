<p>HEAD(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual HEAD(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME head - copy the first part of files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS head [-n number][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The head utility shall copy its input files
to the standard output, ending the output for each file at a
designated point.</p>

<p>Copying shall end at the point in each input file
indicated by the -n number option. The option-argument
number shall be counted in units of lines.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The head utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-n number The first number lines of each input file
shall be copied to standard output. The application shall
ensure that the number option-argument is a positive decimal
integer.</p>

<p>When a file contains less than number lines, it shall be
copied to standard output in its entirety. This shall not be
an error.</p>

<p>If no options are specified, head shall act as if -n 10
had been speci- fied.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If no file operands
are specified, the standard input shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES Input files shall be text files, but the
line length is not restricted to {LINE_MAX} bytes.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of head:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output shall contain designated
portions of the input files.</p>

<p>If multiple file operands are specified, head shall
precede the output for each with the header:</p>

<p>n==&gt; %s &lt;=n&quot;, &lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p>except that the first header written shall not include
the initial &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The obsolescent - number form is
withdrawn in this version. Applica- tions should use the -n
number option.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To write the first ten lines of all files
(except those with a leading period) in the directory:</p>

<p>head *</p>

<p>RATIONALE Although it is possible to simulate head with
sed 10q for a single file, the standard developers decided
that the popularity of head on historical BSD systems
warranted its inclusion alongside tail.</p>

<p>This standard version of head follows the Utility Syntax
Guidelines. The -n option was added to this new interface so
that head and tail would be more logically related.</p>

<p>There is no -c option (as there is in tail) because it
is not histori- cal practice and because other utilities in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 provide similar
functionality.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO sed, tail</p>
