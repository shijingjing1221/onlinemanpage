<p>ERROR::FAULT(7stap) ERROR::FAULT(7stap)</p>

<p>NAME error::fault - memory access faults</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read or write faults can occur during the
operation of a systemtap script, if the script causes
dereferencing of a pointer that turns out to be invalid.
This can be caused by using context variables that do not
happen to have valid values, or perhaps references to memory
that is unavailable at that moment due to paging.</p>

<p>These fault conditions are benign because they are
caught by the sys- temtap runtime, which cleanly terminates
the script. If quick termina- tion is not desired, consider
using the --skip-badvars or --sup- press-handler-errors or
-DMAXERRORS=NN stap options, or wrapping rele- vant parts of
the probe handlers in a try/catch block.</p>

<p>It may be possible to adjust the target program, to make
it more likely that needed context variables are paged in
when systemtap looks for them. Consider adding some
lightweight processing on the key vari- ables, like a
strlen(foo) for a string, or iterating across elements of an
array or linked list, or touching a few bytes of a
heap-allocated block. The idea is to trigger any page faults
in the target program, before systemtap would need to (but
cant).</p>
