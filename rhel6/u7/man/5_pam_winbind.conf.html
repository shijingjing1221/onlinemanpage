<p>PAM_WINBIND.CONF(5) 5 PAM_WINBIND.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME pam_winbind.conf - Configuration file of PAM module
for Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This configuration file is part of the
samba(7) suite.</p>

<p>pam_winbind.conf is the configuration file for the
pam_winbind PAM module. See pam_winbind(8) for further
details.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The pam_winbind.conf configuration file is a
classic ini-style configuration file. There is only one
section (global) where various options are defined.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pam_winbind supports several options which can
either be set in the PAM configuration files or in the
pam_winbind configuration file situated at
/etc/security/pam_winbind.conf. Options from the PAM
configuration file take precedence to those from the
pam_winbind.conf configuration file.</p>

<p>debug = yes|no Gives debugging output to syslog.
Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>debug_state = yes|no Gives detailed PAM state debugging
output to syslog. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>require_membership_of = [SID or NAME] If this option is
set, pam_winbind will only succeed if the user is a member
of the given SID or NAME. A SID can be either a group-SID,
an alias-SID or even an user-SID. It is also possible to
give a NAME instead of the SID. That name must have the
form: MYDOMAINmygroup or MYDOMAINmyuser. pam_winbind will,
in that case, lookup the SID internally. Note that NAME may
not contain any spaces. It is thus recommended to only use
SIDs. You can verify the list of SIDs a user is a member of
with wbinfo --user-sids=SID. This setting is empty by
default.</p>

<p>try_first_pass = yes|no By default, pam_winbind tries to
get the authentication token from a previous module. If no
token is available it asks the user for the old password.
With this option, pam_winbind aborts with an error if no
authentication token from a previous module is available. If
a primary password is not valid, PAM will prompt for a
password. Default to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>krb5_auth = yes|no pam_winbind can authenticate using
Kerberos when winbindd is talking to an Active Directory
domain controller. Kerberos authentication must be enabled
with this parameter. When Kerberos authentication can not
succeed (e.g. due to clock skew), winbindd will fallback to
samlogon authentication over MSRPC. When this parameter is
used in conjunction with winbind refresh tickets, winbind
will keep your Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) uptodate by
refreshing it whenever necessary. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>krb5_ccache_type = [type] When pam_winbind is configured
to try kerberos authentication by enabling the krb5_auth
option, it can store the retrieved Ticket Granting Ticket
(TGT) in a credential cache. The type of credential cache
can be set with this option. Currently the only supported
value is: FILE. In that case a credential cache in the form
of /tmp/krb5cc_UID will be created, where UID is replaced
with the numeric user id. Leave empty to just do kerberos
authentication without having a ticket cache after the logon
has succeeded. This setting is empty by default.</p>

<p>cached_login = yes|no Winbind allows to logon using
cached credentials when winbind offline logon is enabled. To
use this feature from the PAM module this option must be
set. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>silent = yes|no Do not emit any messages. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>mkhomedir = yes|no Create homedirectory for a user
on-the-fly, option is valid in PAM session block. Defaults
to &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>warn_pwd_expire = days Defines number of days before
pam_winbind starts to warn about passwords that are going to
expire. Defaults to 14 days.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3 of
Samba.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>This manpage was written by Jelmer Vernooij and Guenther
Deschner.</p>
