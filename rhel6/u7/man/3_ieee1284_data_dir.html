<p>IEEE1284_DATA(3) Functions IEEE1284_DATA(3)</p>

<p>NAME ieee1284_read_data, ieee1284_write_data,
ieee1284_data_dir, ieee1284_wait_data - control the data
lines</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ieee1284.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ieee1284_read_data(struct parport *port);</p>

<p>void ieee1284_write_data(struct parport *port, unsigned
char dt);</p>

<p>int ieee1284_data_dir(struct parport *port, int
reverse);</p>

<p>int ieee1284_wait_data(struct parport *port, unsigned
char mask, unsigned char val, struct timeval *timeout);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions manipulate the data lines of
the parallel port associated with port (which must have been
claimed using ieee1284_claim(3)). The lines are represented
by an 8-bit number (one line per bit) and a direction. The
data lines are driven as a group; they may be all
host-driven (forward direction) or not (reverse direction).
When the peripheral is driving them the host must not.</p>

<p>For ieee1284_data_dir the reverse parameter should be
zero to turn the data line drivers on and non-zero to turn
them off. Some port types may be unable to switch off the
data line drivers.</p>

<p>Setting the data lines may have side effects on some
port types (for example, some Amiga ports pulse
nStrobe).</p>

<p>ieee1284_wait_data waits, up until the timeout, for the
data bits specified in mask to have the corresponding values
in val.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE ieee1284_read_data returns the 8-bit number
representing the data lines unless it is not possible to
return such a value with this port type, in which case it
returns an error code. Possible error codes:</p>

<p>E1284_NOTAVAIL Bi-directional data lines are not
available on this system.</p>

<p>E1284_INVALIDPORT The port parameter is invalid (perhaps
it has not been claimed, for instance).</p>

<p>E1284_SYS There was an error at the operating system
level, and errno has been set accordingly.</p>

<p>E1284_TIMEDOUT The timeout has elapsed.</p>

<p>Whereas ieee1284_read_data may return E1284_NOTAVAIL on
its first invocation on the port, if it does not do so then
it cannot until ieee1284_close is called for that port.</p>
