<p>TIMEMASTER(8) TIMEMASTER(8)</p>

<p>NAME timemaster - run NTP with PTP as reference
clocks</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS timemaster [ -nmqv ] [ -l print-level ] -f
file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION timemaster is a program that uses ptp4l and
phc2sys in combination with chronyd or ntpd to synchronize
the system clock to NTP and PTP time sources. The PTP time
is provided by phc2sys and ptp4l via SHM refer- ence clocks
to chronyd/ntpd, which can compare all time sources and use
the best sources to synchronize the system clock.</p>

<p>On start, timemaster reads a configuration file that
specifies the NTP and PTP time sources, checks which network
interfaces have and share a PTP hardware clock (PHC),
generates configuration files for ptp4l and chronyd/ntpd,
and start the ptp4l, phc2sys, chronyd/ntpd processes as
needed. Then, it waits for a signal to kill the processes,
remove the generated configuration files and exit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f file Specify the path to the timemaster
configuration file.</p>

<p>-n Don t start the programs, only print their
configuration files and the commands that would be executed
if this option wasnt specified.</p>

<p>-l level Set the maximum syslog level of messages which
should be printed or sent to the system logger. The default
value is 6 (LOG_INFO).</p>

<p>-m Print messages to the standard output.</p>

<p>-q Dont send messages to the system logger.</p>

<p>-v Print the software version and exit.</p>

<p>-h Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file is divided
into sections. Each section starts with a line containing
its name enclosed in brackets and it follows with settings.
Each setting is placed on a separate line, it contains the
name of the option and the value separated by whitespace
charac- ters. Empty lines and lines starting with # are
ignored.</p>

<p>Sections that can used in the configuration file and
options that can be set in them are described below.</p>

<p>[timemaster] ntp_program Select which NTP implementation
should be used. Possible values are chronyd and ntpd. The
default value is chronyd. Limitations of the implementations
relevant to the timemaster configuration are listed in
NOTES.</p>

<p>rundir Specify the directory where should be generated
chronyd, ntpd and ptp4l configuration files and sockets. The
directory will be created if it doesnt exist. The default
value is /var/run/timemaster.</p>

<p>[ntp_server address] The ntp_server section specifies an
NTP server that should be used as a time source. The address
of the server is included in the name of the section.</p>

<p>minpoll maxpoll Specify the minimum and maximum NTP
polling interval as powers of two in seconds. The default
values are 6 (64 seconds) and 10 (1024 seconds)
respectively. Shorter polling intervals usually improve the
accuracy significantly, but they should be used only when
allowed by the operators of the NTP service (pub- lic NTP
servers generally dont allow too frequent queries). If the
NTP server is located on the same LAN, polling intervals
around 4 (16 seconds) might give best accuracy.</p>

<p>iburst Enable or disable sending a burst of NTP packets
on start to speed up the initial synchronization. Possible
values are 1 and 0. The default value is 0 (disabled).</p>

<p>[ptp_domain number] The ptp_domain section specifies a
PTP domain that should be used as a time source. The PTP
domain number is included in the name of the sec- tion. The
ptp4l instances are configured to run in the slaveOnly mode.
In this section at least the interfaces option needs to be
set, other options are optional.</p>

<p>interfaces Specify which network interfaces should be
used for this PTP domain. A separate ptp4l instance will be
started for each group of interfaces sharing the same PHC
and for each interface that supports only SW time stamping.
HW time stamping is enabled automatically. If an interface
with HW time stamping is speci- fied also in other PTP
domains, only the ptp4l instance from the first PTP domain
will be using HW time stamping.</p>

<p>ntp_poll Specify the polling interval of the NTP SHM
reference clock reading samples from ptp4l or phc2sys. It s
specified as a power of two in seconds. The default value is
2 (4 seconds).</p>

<p>phc2sys_poll Specify the polling interval used by
phc2sys to read a PTP clock synchronized by ptp4l and update
the SHM sample for chronyd/ntpd. It s specified as a power
of two in seconds. The default value is 0 (1 second).</p>

<p>delay Specify the maximum assumed roundtrip delay to the
primary source of the time in this PTP domain. This value is
included in the distance used by chronyd in the source
selection algorithm to detect falsetickers and assign
weights for source combining. The default value is 1e-4 (100
microseconds). With ntpd, the tos mindist command can be
used to set a limit with similar purpose globally for all
time sources.</p>

<p>ptp4l_option Specify an extra ptp4l option specific to
this PTP domain that should be added to the configuration
files generated for ptp4l. This option may be used multiple
times in one ptp_domain sec- tion.</p>

<p>[chronyd] path Specify the path to the chronyd binary.
The default value is chronyd to search for the binary in
PATH.</p>

<p>options Specify extra options that should be added to
the chronyd com- mand line. No extra options are added by
default.</p>

<p>[chrony.conf] Settings specified in this section are
copied directly to the configu- ration file generated for
chronyd. If this section is not present in the timemaster
configuration file, the following setting will be added:</p>

<p>makestep 1 3</p>

<p>This configures chronyd to step the system clock in the
first three updates if the offset is larger than 1
second.</p>

<p>[ntpd] path Specify the path to the ntpd binary. The
default value is ntpd to search for the binary in PATH.</p>

<p>options Specify extra options that should be added to
the ntpd command line. No extra options are added by
default.</p>

<p>[ntp.conf] Settings specified in this section are copied
directly to the configu- ration file generated for ntpd. If
this section is not present in the timemaster configuration
file, the following settings will be added:</p>

<p>restrict default nomodify notrap nopeer noquery restrict
127.0.0.1 restrict ::1</p>

<p>This configures ntpd to use safe default
restrictions.</p>

<p>[phc2sys] path Specify the path to the phc2sys binary.
The default value is phc2sys to search for the binary in
PATH.</p>

<p>options Specify extra options that should be added to
all phc2sys com- mand lines. By default, -l 5 is added to
the command lines.</p>

<p>[ptp4l] path Specify the path to the ptp4l binary. The
default value is ptp4l to search for the binary in PATH.</p>

<p>options Specify extra options that should be added to
all ptp4l command lines. By default, -l 5 is added to the
command lines.</p>

<p>[ptp4l.conf] Settings specified in this section are
copied directly to the configu- ration files generated for
all ptp4l instances. There is no default content of this
section.</p>

<p>NOTES For best accuracy, chronyd is usually preferred
over ntpd, it also syn- chronizes the system clock faster.
Both NTP implementations, however, have some limitations
that need to be considered before choosing the one to be
used in a given timemaster configuration.</p>

<p>The chronyd limitations are:</p>

<p>In version 1.31 and older, the maximum number of
reference clocks used at the same time is 8. This limits the
number of PHCs and interfaces using SW time stamping that
can be used for PTP.</p>

<p>Using polling intervals (minpoll, maxpoll, ntp_poll
options) shorter than 2 (4 seconds) is not recommended with
versions before 1.30. With 1.30 and later values of 0 or 1
can be used for NTP sources and negative values for PTP
sources (ntp_poll) to specify a subsecond interval.</p>

<p>The ntpd limitations are:</p>

<p>In versions before 4.2.8p1, only the first two
shared-memory segments created by the ntpd SHM refclock
driver have owner-only access. Other segments are created
with world access, which allows any user on the system to
write to the segments and dis- rupt or take control over the
synchronization of the clock. In 4.2.8p1 the access was made
configurable with the mode option, which is set by
timemaster for owner-ownly access. (in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 it is configurable in ntp-4.2.6p5-3.el6 and
later)</p>

<p>The shortest polling interval for all sources is 3 (8
seconds).</p>

<p>Nanosecond resolution in the SHM refclock driver is
supported in version 4.2.7p303 and later, older versions
have only microsec- ond resolution. (in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6 nanosecond reso- lution is supported in
ntp-4.2.6p5-3.el6 and later)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A minimal configuration file using one NTP
source and two PTP sources would be:</p>

<p>[ntp_server 10.1.1.1]</p>

<p>[ptp_domain 0] interfaces eth0</p>

<p>[ptp_domain 1] interfaces eth1</p>

<p>A more complex example using all timemaster options
would be:</p>

<p>[ntp_server 10.1.1.1] minpoll 3 maxpoll 4 iburst 1</p>

<p>[ptp_domain 0] interfaces eth0 eth1 ntp_poll 0
phc2sys_poll -2 delay 10e-6 ptp4l_option clock_servo linreg
