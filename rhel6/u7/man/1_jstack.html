<p>Name jstack - Stack Trace</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jstack [ option ] pid jstack [ option ]
executable core jstack [ option ]
[server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Options are mutually exclusive. Option, if
used, should follow immedi- ately after the command name.
See OPTIONS.</p>

<p>pid process id for which the stack trace is to be
printed. The pro- cess must be a Java process. To get a list
of Java processes run- ning on a machine, jps(1) may be
used.</p>

<p>executable Java executable from which the core dump was
produced.</p>

<p>core core file for which the stack trace is to be
printed.</p>

<p>remote-hostname-or-IP remote debug servers (see
jsadebugd(1)) hostname or IP address.</p>

<p>server-id optional unique id, if multiple debug servers
are running on the same remote host.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION jstack prints Java stack traces of Java
threads for a given Java pro- cess or core file or a remote
debug server. For each Java frame, the full class name,
method name, bci (byte code index) and line number, if
available, are printed. With the -m option, jstack prints
both Java and native frames of all threads along with the pc
(program counter). For each native frame, the closest native
symbol to pc, if available, is printed. C++ mangled names
are not demangled. To demangle C++ names, the output of this
command may be piped to c++filt. If the given pro- cess is
running on a 64-bit VM, you may need to specify the -J-d64
option, e.g.:</p>

<p>jstack -J-d64 -m pid</p>

<p>NOTE - This utility is unsupported and may or may not be
available in future versions of the JDK. In Windows Systems
where dbgeng.dll is not present, Debugging Tools For Windows
needs to be installed to have these tools working. Also,
PATH environment variable should contain the location of
jvm.dll used by the target process or the location from
which the Crash Dump file was produced.</p>

<p>For example, set PATH=&lt;jdk&gt;jrebinclient;%PATH%</p>

<p>OPTIONS -F Force a stack dump when jstack [-l] pid does
not respond.</p>

<p>-l Long listing. Prints additional information about
locks such as list of owned java.util.concurrent ownable
synchronizers @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concur-
rent/locks/AbstractOwnableSynchronizer.html.</p>

<p>-m prints mixed mode (both Java and native C/C++ frames)
stack trace.</p>

<p>-h prints a help message.</p>

<p>-help prints a help message</p>

<p>KNOWN BUGS Mixed mode stack trace, the -m option, does
not work with the remote debug server.</p>
