<p>BDFLUSH(2) Linux Programmer s Manual BDFLUSH(2)</p>

<p>NAME bdflush - start, flush, or tune buffer-dirty-flush
daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/kdaemon.h&gt;</p>

<p>int bdflush(int func, long *address); int bdflush(int
func, long data);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note: Since Linux 2.6, this system call is
deprecated and does nothing. It is likely to disappear
altogether in a future kernel release. Nowa- days, the task
performed by bdflush() is handled by the kernel pdflush
thread.</p>

<p>bdflush() starts, flushes, or tunes the
buffer-dirty-flush daemon. Only a privileged process (one
with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) may call bdflush().</p>

<p>If func is negative or 0, and no daemon has been
started, then bdflush() enters the daemon code and never
returns.</p>

<p>If func is 1, some dirty buffers are written to
disk.</p>

<p>If func is 2 or more and is even (low bit is 0), then
address is the address of a long word, and the tuning
parameter numbered (func-2)/2 is returned to the caller in
that address.</p>

<p>If func is 3 or more and is odd (low bit is 1), then
data is a long word, and the kernel sets tuning parameter
numbered (func-3)/2 to that value.</p>

<p>The set of parameters, their values, and their valid
ranges are defined in the kernel source file
fs/buffer.c.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If func is negative or 0 and the daemon
successfully starts, bdflush() never returns. Otherwise, the
return value is 0 on success and -1 on failure, with errno
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBUSY An attempt was made to enter the daemon
code after another pro- cess has already entered.</p>

<p>EFAULT address points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL An attempt was made to read or write an invalid
parameter num- ber, or to write an invalid value to a
parameter.</p>

<p>EPERM Caller does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO bdflush() is Linux-specific and should not
be used in programs intended to be portable.</p>
