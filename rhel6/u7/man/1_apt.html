<p>NAME apt - annotation processing tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS apt [-classpath classpath] [-sourcepath
sourcepath] [-d directory] [-s directory] [-factorypath
path] [-factory class] [-print] [-nocompile] [-Akey[=val]
...] [javac option] sourcefiles [@files]</p>

<p>PARAMETERS Options may be in any order. For a discussion
of parameters which apply to a specific option, see OPTIONS
below.</p>

<p>sourcefiles Zero or more source files to be
processed.</p>

<p>@files One or more files that list source files or other
options</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Note: The apt tool and its associated API
contained in the package com.sun.mirror have been deprecated
since JDK 7 and are planned to be removed in the next major
JDK release. Use the options available in the javac(1) tool
and the APIs contained in the packages javax.annota-
tion.processing and javax.lang.model to process
annotations.</p>

<p>The tool apt, annotation processing tool, includes
reflective APIs and supporting infrastructure to process
program annotations. The apt reflective APIs provide a
build-time, source-based, read-only view of program
structure. These reflective APIs are designed to cleanly
model the Java(TM) programming languages type system after
the addition of generics. First, apt runs annotation
processors that can produce new source code and other files.
Next, apt can cause compilation of both original and
generated source files, easing development. The reflective
APIs and other APIs used to interact with the tool are
subpackages of com.sun.mirror.</p>

<p>A fuller discussion of how the tool operates as well as
instructions for developing with apt are in Getting Started
with apt. @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/apt/Get-
tingStarted.html</p>

<p>OPTIONS apt specific options -s dir Specify the
directory root under which processor-generated source files
will be placed; files are placed in subdirectories based on
package namespace.</p>

<p>-nocompile Do not compile source files to class
files.</p>

<p>-print Print out textual representation of specified
types; perform no annotation processing or compilation.</p>

<p>-A[key[=val]] Options to pass to annotation processors
-- these are not inter- preted by apt directly, but are made
available for use by indi- vidual processors</p>

<p>-factorypath path Specify where to find annotation
processor factories; if this option is used, the classpath
is not searched for factories.</p>

<p>-factory classname Name of annotation processor factory
to use; bypasses default discovery process</p>

<p>-version Print version information.</p>

<p>-X Display information about non-standard options.</p>

<p>Options shared with javac -d dir Specify where to place
processor and javac generated class files</p>

<p>-cp path or -classpath path Specify where to find user
class files and annotation processor factories. If
-factorypath is given, the classpath is not searched for
factories.</p>

<p>Consult the javac(1) man page for information on javac
options.</p>

<p>Non-Standard Options -XListAnnotationTypes List found
annotation types.</p>

<p>-XListDeclarations List specified and included
declarations.</p>

<p>-XPrintAptRounds Print information about initial and
recursive apt rounds.</p>

<p>-XPrintFactoryInfo Print information about which
annotations a factory is asked to process.</p>

<p>-XclassesAsDecls Treat both class and source files as
declarations to process.</p>

<p>Note: Because these options are non-standard, they are
subject to change without notice.</p>

<p>NOTES The apt tool and its associated API contained in
the package com.sun.mirror have been deprecated since JDK 7
and are planned to be removed in the next major JDK release.
Use the options available in the javac(1) tool and the APIs
contained in the packages javax.annota- tion.processing and
javax.lang.model to process annotations.</p>
