<p>DIRNAME(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual DIRNAME(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME dirname - return the directory portion of a
pathname</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dirname string</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The string operand shall be treated as a
pathname, as defined in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.266, Path- name. The string
string shall be converted to the name of the directory
containing the filename corresponding to the last pathname
component in string, performing actions equivalent to the
following steps in order:</p>

<p>1. If string is //, skip steps 2 to 5.</p>

<p>2. If string consists entirely of slash characters,
string shall be set to a single slash character. In this
case, skip steps 3 to 8.</p>

<p>3. If there are any trailing slash characters in string,
they shall be removed.</p>

<p>4. If there are no slash characters remaining in string,
string shall be set to a single period character. In this
case, skip steps 5 to 8.</p>

<p>5. If there are any trailing non-slash characters in
string, they shall be removed.</p>

<p>6. If the remaining string is //, it is
implementation-defined whether steps 7 and 8 are skipped or
processed.</p>

<p>7. If there are any trailing slash characters in string,
they shall be removed.</p>

<p>8. If the remaining string is empty, string shall be set
to a single slash character.</p>

<p>The resulting string shall be written to standard
output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>string A string.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of dirname:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The dirname utility shall write a line to the
standard output in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;resulting string&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The definition of pathname specifies
implementation-defined behavior for pathnames starting with
two slash characters. Therefore, applications shall not
arbitrarily add slashes to the beginning of a pathname
unless they can ensure that there are more or less than two
or are prepared to deal with the implementation-defined
consequences.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Command Results dirname / / dirname // / or //
dirname /a/b/ /a dirname //a//b// //a dirname Unspecified
dirname a . ($? = 0) dirname &quot;&quot; . ($? = 0) dirname
/a / dirname /a/b /a dirname a/b a</p>

<p>RATIONALE The dirname utility originated in System III.
It has evolved through the System V releases to a version
that matches the requirements speci- fied in this
description in System V Release 3. 4.3 BSD and earlier
versions did not include dirname.</p>

<p>The behaviors of basename and dirname in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 have been coordinated so that when
string is a valid pathname:</p>

<p>$(basename &quot;string&quot;)</p>

<p>would be a valid filename for the file in the
directory:</p>

<p>$(dirname &quot;string&quot;)</p>

<p>This would not work for the versions of these utilities
in early pro- posals due to the way processing of trailing
slashes was specified. Consideration was given to leaving
processing unspecified if there were trailing slashes, but
this cannot be done; the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.266, Pathname allows trailing
slashes. The basename and dirname utilities have to specify
consistent handling for all valid pathnames.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
