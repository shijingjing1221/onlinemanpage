<p>TEMPNAM(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TEMPNAM(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tempnam - create a name for a temporary file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *tempnam(const char *dir, const char *pfx);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tempnam() function shall generate a
pathname that may be used for a temporary file.</p>

<p>The tempnam() function allows the user to control the
choice of a directory. The dir argument points to the name
of the directory in which the file is to be created. If dir
is a null pointer or points to a string which is not a name
for an appropriate directory, the path prefix defined as
P_tmpdir in the &lt;stdio.h&gt; header shall be used. If
that directory is not accessible, an implementation-defined
directory may be used.</p>

<p>Many applications prefer their temporary files to have
certain initial letter sequences in their names. The pfx
argument should be used for this. This argument may be a
null pointer or point to a string of up to five bytes to be
used as the beginning of the filename.</p>

<p>Some implementations of tempnam() may use tmpnam()
internally. On such implementations, if called more than
{TMP_MAX} times in a single pro- cess, the behavior is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, tempnam() shall
allocate space for a string, put the generated pathname in
that space, and return a pointer to it. The pointer shall be
suitable for use in a subsequent call to free(). Otherwise,
it shall return a null pointer and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tempnam() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Generating a Pathname The following example
generates a pathname for a temporary file in directory /tmp,
with the prefix file. After the filename has been cre- ated,
the call to free() deallocates the space used to store the
file- name.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; ...
char *directory = &quot;/tmp&quot;; char *fileprefix =
&quot;file&quot;; char *file;</p>

<p>file = tempnam(directory, fileprefix); free(file);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This function only creates pathnames.
It is the applications responsi- bility to create and remove
the files. Between the time a pathname is created and the
file is opened, it is possible for some other process to
create a file with the same name. Applications may find
tmpfile() more useful.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
