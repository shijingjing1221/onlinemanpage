<p>NAME XmVaCreateSimplePulldownMenu A RowColumn widget
convenience creation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmVaCreateSimplePulldownMenu( Widget parent, String name,
int post_from_button, XtCallbackProc callback);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmVaCreateSimplePulldownMenu creates an
instance of a RowColumn widget of type XmMENU_PULLDOWN and
returns the associated widget ID. This routine uses the ANSI
C variable-length argument list (varargs) calling
convention.</p>

<p>This routine creates a Pulldown menu pane and its button
children. The name of each button is button_n, where n is an
integer from 0 to the number of buttons in the menu minus 1.
The name of each separator is separator_n, where n is an
integer from 0 to the number of separators in the menu minus
1. The name of each title is label_n, where n is an integer
from 0 (zero) to the number of titles in the menu minus 1.
Buttons, separators, and titles are named and created in the
order in which they are specified in the variable portion of
the argument list.</p>

<p>This routine also attaches the PulldownMenu to a
CascadeButton or Cas- cadeButtonGadget in the parent. The
PulldownMenu is then posted from this button.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the widget ID of the parent of the
MenuShell.</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the created widget.</p>

<p>post_from_button Specifies the CascadeButton or
CascadeButtonGadget in the parent to which the Pulldown menu
pane is attached. The value is the integer n that
corresponds to the nth Cascade- Button or
CascadeButtonGadget specified for the parent of the Pulldown
menu pane. A Pulldown menu pane can be attached only to a
CascadeButton or CascadeButtonGadget, and only Cas-
cadeButtons and CascadeButtonGadgets are counted in
determin- ing the integer n. The first CascadeButton or
CascadeButton- Gadget is number 0 (zero).</p>

<p>callback Specifies a callback procedure to be called
when a button is activated or when its value changes. This
callback function is added to each button after creation.
For a CascadeButton- Gadget or a PushButtonGadget, the
callback is added as the button s XmNactivateCallback, and
it is called when the but- ton is activated. For a
ToggleButtonGadget, the callback is added as the button s
XmNvalueChangedCallback, and it is called when the button s
value changes. The button number is returned in the
client_data field.</p>

<p>The variable portion of the argument list consists of
groups of argu- ments. The first argument in each group is a
constant or a string and determines which arguments follow
in that group. The last argument in the list must be NULL.
Following are the possible first arguments in each group of
varargs:</p>

<p>XmVaCASCADEBUTTON This is followed by two additional
arguments. The set speci- fies one button in the
PulldownMenu and some of its resource values. The button
created is a CascadeButtonGadget. Follow- ing are the
additional two arguments, in order:</p>

<p>label The label string, of type XmString</p>

<p>mnemonic The mnemonic, of type KeySym</p>

<p>XmVaPUSHBUTTON This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies one button in the
PulldownMenu and some of its resource values. The button
created is a PushButtonGadget. Following are the additional
four arguments, in order:</p>

<p>label The label string, of type XmString</p>

<p>mnemonic The mnemonic, of type KeySym</p>

<p>accelerator The accelerator, of type String</p>

<p>accelerator_text The accelerator text, of type
XmString</p>

<p>XmVaRADIOBUTTON This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies one button in the
PulldownMenu and some of its resource values. The button
created is a ToggleButtonGadget. Following are the
additional four arguments, in order:</p>

<p>label The label string, of type XmString</p>

<p>mnemonic The mnemonic, of type KeySym</p>

<p>accelerator The accelerator, of type String</p>

<p>accelerator_text The accelerator text, of type
XmString</p>

<p>XmVaCHECKBUTTON This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies one button in the
PulldownMenu and some of its resource values. The button
created is a ToggleButtonGadget. Following are the
additional four arguments, in order:</p>

<p>label The label string, of type XmString.</p>

<p>mnemonic The mnemonic, of type KeySym</p>

<p>accelerator The accelerator, of type String</p>

<p>accelerator_text The accelerator text, of type
XmString</p>

<p>XmVaTITLE This is followed by one additional argument.
The pair speci- fies a title LabelGadget in the
PulldownMenu. Following is the additional argument:</p>

<p>title The title string, of type XmString</p>

<p>XmVaSEPARATOR This is followed by no additional
arguments. It specifies one separator in the
PulldownMenu.</p>

<p>XmVaDOUBLE_SEPARATOR This is followed by no additional
arguments. It specifies one separator in the PulldownMenu.
The separator type is XmDOU- BLE_LINE.</p>

<p>resource_name This is followed by one additional
argument, the value of the resource, of type XtArgVal. The
pair specifies a resource and its value for the RowColumn
widget.</p>

<p>XtVaTypedArg This is followed by four additional
arguments. The set speci- fies a resource and its value for
the RowColumn widget. A resource type conversion is
performed if necessary. Following are the additional four
arguments, in order:</p>

<p>name The resource name, of type String.</p>

<p>type The type of the resource value supplied, of type
String.</p>

<p>value The resource value (or a pointer to the resource
value, depending on the type and size of the value), of type
XtArgVal.</p>

<p>size The size of the resource value in bytes, of type
int.</p>

<p>XtVaNestedList This is followed by one additional
argument of type XtVarArgsList. This argument is a nested
list of varargs returned by XtVaCreateArgsList.</p>

<p>For more information on variable-length argument lists,
see the X Toolkit Intrinsics documentation.</p>

<p>A number of resources exist specifically for use with
this and other simple menu creation routines. For a complete
definition of RowColumn and its associated resources, see
XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the RowColumn widget ID.</p>
