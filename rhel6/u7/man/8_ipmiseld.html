<p>NAME ipmiseld - IPMI SEL logging daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipmiseld [OPTION...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ipmiseld daemon polls the system event
log (SEL) of specified hosts and stores the logs into the
local syslog. By default, the daemon can also make best
efforts to manage the remote SEL s buffer to ensure events
are never lost. Recent logging data will be cached to disk
to ensure that SEL events are not missed in the event the
client or server is rebooted.</p>

<p>Many of the options for this daemon are very similar to
the ipmi-sel(8) tool. It can be configured to log the local
host, a remote host, or a range of hosts to the local
syslog. It can be configured via the com- mand line
arguments listed below or via the /etc//ipmiseld.conf
config- uration file.</p>

<p>Listed below are general IPMI options, tool specific
options, trouble shooting information, workaround
information, examples, and known issues. For a general
introduction to FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7).</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS The following options are general
options for configuring IPMI communi- cation and executing
general tool commands.</p>

<p>-D IPMIDRIVER, --driver-type=IPMIDRIVER Specify the
driver type to use instead of doing an auto selec- tion. The
currently available outofband drivers are LAN and LAN_2_0,
which perform IPMI 1.5 and IPMI 2.0 respectively. The
currently available inband drivers are KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI,
and SUNBMC.</p>

<p>--disable-auto-probe Do not probe in-band IPMI devices
for default settings.</p>

<p>--driver-address=DRIVER-ADDRESS Specify the in-band
driver address to be used instead of the probed value.
DRIVER-ADDRESS should be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; for a
hex value and 0 for an octal value.</p>

<p>--driver-device=DEVICE Specify the in-band driver device
path to be used instead of the probed path.</p>

<p>--register-spacing=REGISTER-SPACING Specify the in-band
driver register spacing instead of the probed value.
Argument is in bytes (i.e. 32bit register spacing = 4)</p>

<p>--target-channel-number=CHANNEL-NUMBER Specify the
in-band driver target channel number to send IPMI requests
to.</p>

<p>--target-slave-address=SLAVE-ADDRESS Specify the in-band
driver target slave number to send IPMI requests to.</p>

<p>-h IPMIHOST1,IPMIHOST2,...,
--hostname=IPMIHOST1[:PORT],IPMI- HOST2[:PORT],... Specify
the remote host(s) to communicate with. Multiple hostnames
may be separated by comma or may be specified in a range
format; see HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below. An optional port can
be specified with each host, which may be useful in port
for- warding or similar situations.</p>

<p>-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME Specify the username to
use when authenticating with the remote host. If not
specified, a null (i.e. anonymous) username is assumed. The
user must have atleast USER privileges in order for this
tool to operate fully.</p>

<p>-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD Specify the password to
use when authenticationg with the remote host. If not
specified, a null password is assumed. Maximum password
length is 16 for IPMI 1.5 and 20 for IPMI 2.0.</p>

<p>-P, --password-prompt Prompt for password to avoid
possibility of listing it in pro- cess lists.</p>

<p>-k K_G, --k-g=K_G Specify the K_g BMC key to use when
authenticating with the remote host for IPMI 2.0. If not
specified, a null key is assumed. To input the key in
hexadecimal form, prefix the string with 0x. E.g., the key
abc can be entered with the either the string abc or the
string 0x616263</p>

<p>-K, --k-g-prompt Prompt for k-g to avoid possibility of
listing it in process lists.</p>

<p>--session-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the session
timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20
seconds) if not specified.</p>

<p>--retransmission-timeout=MILLISECONDS Specify the packet
retransmission timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000
milliseconds (1 second) if not specified. The retransmission
timeout cannot be larger than the session time- out.</p>

<p>-a AUTHENTICATION-TYPE,
--authentication-type=AUTHENTICATION-TYPE Specify the IPMI
1.5 authentication type to use. The currently available
authentication types are NONE, STRAIGHT_PASSWORD_KEY, MD2,
and MD5. Defaults to MD5 if not specified.</p>

<p>-I CIPHER-SUITE-ID, --cipher-suite-id=CIPHER-SUITE-ID
Specify the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID to use. The Cipher
Suite ID identifies a set of authentication, integrity, and
confidential- ity algorithms to use for IPMI 2.0
communication. The authenti- cation algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for session setup, the integrity algorithm
identifies the algorithm to use for session packet
signatures, and the confidentiality algorithm identifies the
algorithm to use for payload encryption. Defaults to cipher
suite ID 3 if not specified. The following cipher suite ids
are currently supported:</p>

<p>0 - Authentication Algorithm = None; Integrity Algorithm
= None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>1 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>2 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>3 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-SHA1-96; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>6 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>7 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>8 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC-MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>11 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>12 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-MD5; Integrity
Algorithm = MD5-128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>15 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = None; Confidentiality Algorithm = None</p>

<p>16 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
None</p>

<p>17 - Authentication Algorithm = HMAC-SHA256; Integrity
Algorithm = HMAC_SHA256_128; Confidentiality Algorithm =
AES-CBC-128</p>

<p>-l PRIVILEGE-LEVEL, --privilege-level=PRIVILEGE-LEVEL
Specify the privilege level to be used. The currently
available privilege levels are USER, OPERATOR, and ADMIN.
Defaults to OPERATOR if not specified.</p>

<p>--config-file=FILE Specify an alternate configuration
file.</p>

<p>-W WORKAROUNDS, --workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS Specify
workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
com- mand line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
workarounds (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p>--debug Turn on debugging.</p>

<p>-?, --help Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p>--usage Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p>IPMISELD OPTIONS The following options are specific to
Ipmiseld.</p>

<p>-v Log verbose information. This option will log
additional infor- mation. Most notably it will output
additional hex codes to given information on ambiguous SEL
entries or SEL records. For example, it will output
Generator ID hex codes for sensors with- out names.
Additional non-critical SEL errors or issues will also be
logged. Somewhat common errors, such as timeouts or invalid
hostnames, will output with increased verbosity.</p>

<p>-t SENSOR-TYPE-LIST, --sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST
Specify sensor types of SEL events to log. By default, all
sen- sor types are logged. A special command line type of
&quot;all&quot;, will indicate all types should be shown
(may be useful for overriding configured defaults). Multiple
types can be separated by commas or spaces. Users may
specify sensor types by string (see --list-sensor-types in
ipmi-sel(8)) or by number (decimal or hex).</p>

<p>-T SENSOR-TYPE-LIST,
--exclude-sensor-types=SENSOR-TYPE-LIST Specify sensor types
of SEL events to not log. By default, no sensor types are
filtered. A special command line type of &quot;none&quot;,
will indicate no types should be excluded (may be useful for
overriding configured defaults). Multiple types can be sepa-
rated by commas or spaces. Users may specify sensor types by
string (see --list-sensor-types in ipmi-sel(8)) or by number
(decimal or hex).</p>

<p>--system-event-only Log only system event records (i.e.
dont log OEM records).</p>

<p>--oem-event-only Log only OEM event records (i.e. don t
log system event records).</p>

<p>--event-state-config-file=FILE Specify an alternate
event state configuration file.</p>

<p>--interpret-oem-data Attempt to interpret OEM data, such
as event data, sensor read- ings, or general extra info,
etc. If an OEM interpretation is not available, the default
output will be generated. Correctness of OEM interpretations
cannot be guaranteed due to potential changes OEM vendors
may make in products, firmware, etc. See OEM INTERPRETATION
below for confirmed supported motherboard inter-
pretations.</p>

<p>--entity-sensor-names Output sensor names prefixed with
their entity id and instance number when appropriate. This
may be necessary on some mother- boards to help identify
what sensors are referencing. For exam- ple, a motherboard
may have multiple sensors named TEMP. The entity id and
instance number may help clarify which sensor refers to
&quot;Processor 1&quot; vs. &quot;Processor 2&quot;.</p>

<p>--non-abbreviated-units Output non-abbreviated units
(e.g. Amps instead of A). May aid in disambiguation of units
(e.g. C for Celsius or Coulombs).</p>

<p>--event-state-filter=FILTERSTRING Specify event states
to be filtered out and not logged. Possible inputs are
NOMINAL, WARNING, CRITICAL, and NA. Multiple states can be
listed separted by comma. The special case string of
&quot;none&quot; will indicate no event states should be
excluded (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults).</p>

<p>--warning-threshold=PERCENTINT Specify SEL fullness
warning threshold as an integer percentage. When the SEL is
past this percentage full, a warning will be output
indicating that SEL is nearly full. Specify 0 to disable
warning logs. Defaults to 80.</p>

<p>--clear-threshold=PERCENTINT Specify SEL fullness clear
threshold as an integer percentage. When the SEL is past
this percentage full, ipmiseld will attempt to clear the
SEL. Specify 0 to disable clearing. When the SEL is full, it
will be the responsibility of the user to clear the SEL
manually if clearing is disabled. Defaults to 0. If
specified to a non-zero value, be careful that the clearing
of the SEL could affect other applications that monitor the
SEL, such as monitor- ing applications that use ipmi-sel(8)
or libipmimonitoring(3).</p>

<p>--system-event-format=FORMATSTRING Specify the format of
the log output when a SEL system event is encountered.
Defaults to &quot;SEL System Event: %d, %t, %s, %I, %E&quot;
if logging locally, &quot;SEL System Event(%h): %d, %t, %s,
%I, %E&quot; if logging outofband or with hostranges. See
SEL LOG FORMAT STRING below for formatting details.</p>

<p>--oem-timestamped-event-format=FORMATSTRING Specify the
format of the log output when a SEL OEM timestamped event is
encountered. Defaults to &quot;SEL OEM Event: %d, %t, %I,
%o&quot; if logging locally, &quot;SEL OEM Event(%h): %d,
%t, %I, %o&quot; if logging outofband or with hostranges..
See SEL LOG FORMAT STRING below for formatting details.</p>

<p>--oem-non-timestamped-event-format=FORMATSTRING Specify
the format of the log output when a SEL OEM non-times-
tamped event is encountered. Defaults to &quot;SEL OEM
Event: %I, %o&quot; if logging locally, &quot;SEL OEM
Event(%h): %I, %o&quot; if logging out- ofband or with
hostranges.. See SEL LOG FORMAT STRING below for formatting
details.</p>

<p>--poll-interval=SECONDS Specify the poll interval to
check the SEL for new events. Defaults to 300 seconds (i.e.
5 minutes).</p>

<p>--log-facility=STRING Specify the log facility to use.
Defaults to LOG_DAEMON. Legal inputs are LOG_DAEMON,
LOG_USER, LOG_LOCAL0, LOG_LOCAL1, LOG_LOCAL2, LOG_LOCAL3,
LOG_LOCAL4, LOG_LOCAL5, LOG_LOCAL6, LOG_LOCAL7.</p>

<p>--log-priority=STRING Specify the log priority to use.
Defaults to LOG_ERR. Legal inputs are LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT,
LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR, LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO,
LOG_DEBUG.</p>

<p>--cache-directory=DIRECTORY Specify an alternate cache
directory location for ipmiseld to use. The cache directory
will be used to cache a wide variety of data, including the
SDR and recent logging information to ensure log entries are
not missed on reboots and other system failures.</p>

<p>--ignore-sdr Ignore SDR related processing. May lead to
incomplete or less useful information being output, however
it will allow function- ality for systems without SDRs or
when the correct SDR cannot be loaded.</p>

<p>--re-download-sdr Re-download the SDR on start even if
it is not out of date. This may help work around systems
that do not properly timestamp SDR modification times.</p>

<p>--clear-sel On startup, clear any SEL being monitored.
May be useful the first time running ipmiseld to avoid
warning messages or SEL clears until a long time in the
future.</p>

<p>--threadpool-count=NUM Specify the number of threads for
parallel SEL polling. This option is very similar to the
--fanout option in ipmi-sel(8) but the threads are created
only once on initialization for faster processing. Defaults
to 8, however the threadpool count will always be decreased
if the number of nodes specified is less than the number of
threads.</p>

<p>--test-run Do not daemonize, output the current SEL of
configured hosts as a test of current settings and
configuration.</p>

<p>--foreground Run daemon in the foreground.</p>

<p>SEL LOG FORMAT STRING The output format of log messages
can be adjusted via the --sys- tem-event-format,
--oem-timestamped-event-format and --oem-non-times-
tamped-event-format options. Options such as
--interpret-oem-data, --entity-sensor-names, and
--non-abbreviated-units can further adjust the output
format. The following conversion directives will allow the
user to output specifics of each SEL event that occurs.</p>

<p>For System, OEM timestamped, and OEM non-timestamped
events</p>

<p>%h - target host, useful if logging from multiple
hosts</p>

<p>%i - record ID in decimal</p>

<p>%I - event state interpretation (NOMINAL, WARNING, or
CRITICAL)</p>

<p>For System and OEM timestamped events</p>

<p>%t - time in format H:M:S using 24 hour clock</p>

<p>%d - date in format D-M-YEAR</p>

<p>For System events</p>

<p>%T - sensor type</p>

<p>%s - sensor name</p>

<p>%e - event data 1 string</p>

<p>%f - event data 2 string [2]</p>

<p>%h - event data 3 string</p>

<p>%c - combined event data 2 and event data 3 string</p>

<p>%p - event data 2 previous state string</p>

<p>%S - event data 2 severity string</p>

<p>%E - combined event data 1, 2, and 3 string</p>

<p>%k - event direction</p>

<p>For OEM timestamped events</p>

<p>%m - manufacturer id</p>

<p>For OEM timestamped and OEM non-timestamped events</p>

<p>%o - oem data in hex</p>

<p>%O - OEM supplied string describing the event (depends
on manufacturer)</p>

<p>HOSTRANGED SUPPORT Multiple hosts can be input either as
an explicit comma separated lists of hosts or a range of
hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l- k,...], where n
&lt; m and l &lt; k, etc. The later form should not be
confused with regular expression character classes (also
denoted by []). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1
or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range:
foo19.</p>

<p>This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on
clusters with a prefixNN naming convention and specification
of ranges should not be considered necessary -- the list
foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or by the range
foo[1,9].</p>

<p>Some examples of range usage follow: foo[01-05] instead
of foo01,foo02,foo03,foo04,foo05 foo[7,9-10] instead of
foo7,foo9,foo10 foo[0-3] instead of foo0,foo1,foo2,foo3</p>

<p>As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret
brackets ([ and ]) for pattern matching. Depending on your
shell, it may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within
quotes.</p>

<p>In-band IPMI Communication will be used when the host
&quot;localhost&quot; is specified. This allows the user to
add the localhost into the hos- tranged output.</p>

<p>GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING Most often, IPMI problems are
due to configuration problems.</p>

<p>IPMI over LAN problems involve a misconfiguration of the
remote machines BMC. Double check to make sure the following
are configured properly in the remote machines BMC: IP
address, MAC address, subnet mask, username, user
enablement, user privilege, password, LAN privi- lege, LAN
enablement, and allowed authentication type(s). For IPMI 2.0
connections, double check to make sure the cipher suite
privilege(s) and K_g key are configured properly. The
bmc-config(8) tool can be used to check and/or change these
configuration settings.</p>

<p>Inband IPMI problems are typically caused by improperly
configured drivers or non-standard BMCs.</p>

<p>In addition to the troubleshooting tips below, please
see WORKAROUNDS below to also if there are any vendor
specific bugs that have been dis- covered and worked
around.</p>

<p>Listed below are many of the common issues for error
messages. For additional support, please e-mail the
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; mailing list.</p>

<p>&quot;username invalid&quot; - The username entered (or
a NULL username if none was entered) is not available on the
remote machine. It may also be possible the remote BMC s
username configuration is incorrect.</p>

<p>&quot;password invalid&quot; - The password entered (or
a NULL password if none was entered) is not correct. It may
also be possible the password for the user is not correctly
configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;password verification timeout&quot; - Password
verification has timed out. A &quot;password invalid&quot;
error (described above) or a generic &quot;session
timeout&quot; (described below) occurred. During this point
in the protocol it cannot be differentiated which
occurred.</p>

<p>&quot;k_g invalid&quot; - The K_g key entered (or a NULL
K_g key if none was entered) is not correct. It may also be
possible the K_g key is not correctly configured on the
remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level insufficient&quot; - An IPMI
command requires a higher user privilege than the one
authenticated with. Please try to authenticate with a higher
privilege. This may require authenticating to a different
user which has a higher maximum privilege.</p>

<p>&quot;privilege level cannot be obtained for this
user&quot; - The privilege level you are attempting to
authenticate with is higher than the maxi- mum allowed for
this user. Please try again with a lower privilege. It may
also be possible the maximum privilege level allowed for a
user is not configured properly on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;authentication type unavailable for attempted
privilege level&quot; - The authentication type you wish to
authenticate with is not available for this privilege level.
Please try again with an alternate authentication type or
alternate privilege level. It may also be possible the
avail- able authentication types you can authenticate with
are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;cipher suite id unavailable&quot; - The cipher
suite id you wish to authen- ticate with is not available on
the remote BMC. Please try again with an alternate cipher
suite id. It may also be possible the available cipher suite
ids are not correctly configured on the remote BMC.</p>

<p>&quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot; - IPMI 2.0 was not
discovered on the remote machine. Please try to use IPMI 1.5
instead.</p>

<p>&quot;connection timeout&quot; - Initial IPMI
communication failed. A number of potential errors are
possible, including an invalid hostname specified, an IPMI
IP address cannot be resolved, IPMI is not enabled on the
remote server, the network connection is bad, etc. Please
verify con- figuration and connectivity.</p>

<p>&quot;session timeout&quot; - The IPMI session has timed
out. Please reconnect. If this error occurs often, you may
wish to increase the retransmission timeout. Some remote
BMCs are considerably slower than others.</p>

<p>&quot;device not found&quot; - The specified device
could not be found. Please check configuration or inputs and
try again.</p>

<p>&quot;driver timeout&quot; - Communication with the
driver or device has timed out. Please try again.</p>

<p>&quot;message timeout&quot; - Communication with the
driver or device has timed out. Please try again.</p>

<p>&quot;BMC busy&quot; - The BMC is currently busy. It may
be processing informa- tion or have too many simultaneous
sessions to manage. Please wait and try again.</p>

<p>&quot;could not find inband device&quot; - An inband
device could not be found. Please check configuration or
specify specific device or driver on the command line.</p>

<p>&quot;driver timeout&quot; - The inband driver has timed
out communicating to the local BMC or service processor. The
BMC or service processor may be busy or (worst case)
possibly non-functioning.</p>

<p>IPMISELD TROUBLESHOOTING Some timestamps in the SEL may
report a date of 1-Jan-1970, the epoch for SEL timestamps.
This timestamp is not necessarily incorrect. It usually
indicates a hardware event that occurred before a timestamp
in firmware has been initialized. For example, certain
hardware components will have their internal clocks reset
during a power cycle.</p>

<p>However, if the internal clock of the SEL appears to be
regularly incorrect, you may need to set the SEL time. This
can be done using bmc-device(8).</p>

<p>The following are common SEL related messages.</p>

<p>&quot;sel config file parse error&quot; - A parse error
was found in the sel event interpretation configuration
file. Please see freeipmi_interpret_sel.conf(5).</p>

<p>WORKAROUNDS With so many different vendors implementing
their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a
number of workarounds currently available to han- dle
discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds
have been implemented so they will be transparent to the
user. However, some will require the user to specify a
workaround be used via the -W option.</p>

<p>The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware
that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware
may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not
listed.</p>

<p>If you believe your hardware has an additional
compliance issue that needs a workaround to be implemented,
please contact the FreeIPMI main- tainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p>assumeio - This workaround flag will assume inband
interfaces communi- cate with system I/O rather than being
memory-mapped. This will work around systems that report
invalid base addresses. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;device not supported&quot; or &quot;could not find
inband device&quot; errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant
DL145 G1.</p>

<p>spinpoll - This workaround flag will inform some inband
drivers (most notably the KCS driver) to spin while polling
rather than putting the process to sleep. This may
significantly improve the wall clock running time of tools
because an operating system scheduler s granularity may be
much larger than the time it takes to perform a single IPMI
message transaction. However, by spinning, your system may
be performing less useful work by not contexting out the
tool for a more useful task.</p>

<p>authcap - This workaround flag will skip early checks
for username capabilities, authentication capabilities, and
K_g support and allow IPMI authentication to succeed. It
works around multiple issues in which the remote system does
not properly report username capabilities, authentication
capabilities, or K_g status. Those hitting this issue may
see &quot;username invalid&quot;, &quot;authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level&quot;, or
&quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, and Sun Fire
2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.</p>

<p>idzero - This workaround flag will allow empty session
IDs to be accepted by the client. It works around IPMI
sessions that report empty session IDs to the client. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Tyan S2882 with M3289 BMC.</p>

<p>unexpectedauth - This workaround flag will allow
unexpected non-null authcodes to be checked as though they
were expected. It works around an issue when packets contain
non-null authentication data when they should be null due to
disabled per-message authentication. Those hit- ting this
issue may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Dell PowerEdge 2850,SC1425. Confirmed fixed on
newer firmware.</p>

<p>forcepermsg - This workaround flag will force
per-message authentica- tion to be used no matter what is
advertised by the remote system. It works around an issue
when per-message authentication is advertised as disabled on
the remote system, but it is actually required for the pro-
tocol. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;session
timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on IBM eServer 325.</p>

<p>endianseq - This workaround flag will flip the endian of
the session sequence numbers to allow the session to
continue properly. It works around IPMI 1.5 session sequence
numbers that are the wrong endian. Those hitting this issue
may see &quot;session timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed
on some Sun ILOM 1.0/2.0 (depends on service processor
endian).</p>

<p>noauthcodecheck - This workaround flag will tell
FreeIPMI to not check the authentication codes returned from
IPMI 1.5 command responses. It works around systems to
return invalid authentication codes due to hashing or
implementation errors. Users are cautioned on the use of
this option, as it removes an authentication check verifying
the valid- ity of a packet. However, in most organizations,
this is unlikely to be a security issue. Those hitting this
issue may see &quot;connection time- out&quot;,
&quot;session timeout&quot;, or &quot;password verification
timeout&quot; errors. Issue observed on Xyratex
FB-H8-SRAY.</p>

<p>intel20 - This workaround flag will work around several
Intel IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues covered
include padding of usernames, and password truncation if the
authentication algorithm is HMAC- MD5-128. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;username invalid&quot;,
&quot;password invalid&quot;, or &quot;k_g invalid&quot;
errors. Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server
Management Module (Professional Edition).</p>

<p>supermicro20 - This workaround flag will work around
several Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues on
motherboards w/ Peppercon IPMI firmware. The issues covered
include handling invalid length authenti- cation codes.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;password
invalid&quot; errors. Issue observed on Supermicro H8QME
with SIMSO daughter card. Confirmed fixed on newerver
firmware.</p>

<p>sun20 - This workaround flag will work work around
several Sun IPMI 2.0 authentication issues. The issues
covered include invalid lengthed hash keys, improperly
hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite records. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;password invalid&quot; or &quot;bmc
error&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun Fire
4100/4200/4500 with ILOM. This workaround automatically
includes the &quot;opensesspriv&quot; workaround.</p>

<p>opensesspriv - This workaround flag will slightly alter
FreeIPMIs IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an
invalid hashing algorithm used by the remote system. The
privilege level sent during the Open Session stage of an
IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing keys instead of the
privilege level sent during the RAKP1 connection stage.
Those hitting this issue may see &quot;password
invalid&quot;, &quot;k_g invalid&quot;, or &quot;bad
rmcpplus status code&quot; errors. Issue observed on Sun
Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II,
Supermicro X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, and Quanta
QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN. This workaround is automatically
triggered with the &quot;sun20&quot; workaround.</p>

<p>integritycheckvalue - This workaround flag will work
around an invalid integrity check value during an IPMI 2.0
session establishment when using Cipher Suite ID 0. The
integrity check value should be 0 length, however the remote
motherboard responds with a non-empty field. Those hitting
this issue may see &quot;k_g invalid&quot; errors. Issue
observed on Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, and Intel
S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700, and Intel S2600JF/Appro
512X.</p>

<p>assumesystemevent - This workaround option will assume
invalid SEL record types are system event records. Records
may be formatted cor- rectly but report invalid record
types. Those hitting this issue may see &quot;Unknown SEL
Record Type&quot; errors. Output may be unknown, pray for
the best. This option is confirmed to work around
compliances issues on HP DL 380 G5 motherboards.</p>

<p>No IPMI 1.5 Support - Some motherboards that support
IPMI 2.0 have been found to not support IPMI 1.5. Those
hitting this issue may see &quot;ipmi 2.0 unavailable&quot;
or &quot;connection timeout&quot; errors. This issue can be
worked around by using IPMI 2.0 instead of IPMI 1.5 by
specifying --driver-address=LAN_2_0. Issue observed on HP
Proliant DL 145.</p>

<p>OEM INTERPRETATION The following motherboards are
confirmed to have atleast some support by the
--interpret-oem-data option. While highly probable the OEM
data interpretations would work across other motherboards by
the same manu- facturer, there are no guarantees. Some of
the motherboards below may be rebranded by
vendors/distributors.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES On older operating systems, if you input
your username, password, and other potentially security
relevant information on the command line, this information
may be discovered by other users when using tools like the
ps(1) command or looking in the /proc file system. It is
generally more secure to input password information with
options like the -P or -K options. Configuring security
relevant information in the FreeIPMI configuration file
would also be an appropriate way to hide this infor-
mation.</p>

<p>In order to prevent brute force attacks, some BMCs will
temporarily &quot;lock up&quot; after a number of remote
authentication errors. You may need to wait awhile in order
to this temporary &quot;lock up&quot; to pass before you may
authenticate again.</p>
