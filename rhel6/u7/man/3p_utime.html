<p>UTIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UTIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME utime - set file access and modification times</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;utime.h&gt;</p>

<p>int utime(const char *path, const struct utimbuf
*times);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The utime() function shall set the access
and modification times of the file named by the path
argument.</p>

<p>If times is a null pointer, the access and modification
times of the file shall be set to the current time. The
effective user ID of the process shall match the owner of
the file, or the process has write permission to the file or
has appropriate privileges, to use utime() in this
manner.</p>

<p>If times is not a null pointer, times shall be
interpreted as a pointer to a utimbuf structure and the
access and modification times shall be set to the values
contained in the designated structure. Only a process with
the effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file or a
pro- cess with appropriate privileges may use utime() this
way.</p>

<p>The utimbuf structure is defined in the &lt;utime.h&gt;
header. The times in the structure utimbuf are measured in
seconds since the Epoch.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, utime() shall mark the time
of the last file status change, st_ctime, to be updated; see
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno shall be
set to indicate the error, and the file times shall not be
affected.</p>

<p>ERRORS The utime() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied by a component of the
path prefix; or the times argument is a null pointer and the
effective user ID of the process does not match the owner of
the file, the pro- cess does not have write permission for
the file, and the pro- cess does not have appropriate
privileges.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The times argument is not a null pointer and the
calling pro- cess effective user ID does not match the owner
of the file and the calling process does not have the
appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>EROFS The file system containing the file is
read-only.</p>

<p>The utime() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The actime structure member must be present so
that an application may set it, even though an
implementation may ignore it and not change the access time
on the file. If an application intends to leave one of the
times of a file unchanged while changing the other, it
should use stat() to retrieve the files st_atime and
st_mtime parameters, set actime and modtime in the buffer,
and change one of them before making the utime() call.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
