<p>bmc-watchdog(8) System Commands bmc-watchdog(8)</p>

<p>NAME bmc-watchdog - BMC watchdog timer daemon and
control utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bmc-watchdog command [OPTION...]
[COMMAND_OPTIONS...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION bmc-watchdog controls a Baseboard Management
Controller (BMC) watchdog timer. The bmc-watchdog tool
typically executes as a cronjob or daemon to manage the
watchdog timer. A user must be root in order to run bmc-
watchdog.</p>

<p>Listed below are bmc-watchdog details, option details,
examples, and known issues. For a general introduction to
FreeIPMI please see freeipmi(7).</p>

<p>BMC WATCHDOG DETAILS A BMC watchdog timer is part of the
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)
specification and is only available to BMCs that are
compliant with IPMI. When a BMC watchdog timer is started,
it begins counting down to zero from some positive number of
seconds. When the timer hits zero, the timer will execute a
pre-configured pre-timeout interrupt and/or timeout
action.</p>

<p>In order to stop the pre-timeout interrupt or timeout
action from being executed, the watchdog timer must be
periodically reset back to its initial beginning value.</p>

<p>The BMC watchdog timer automatically stops itself when
the machine is rebooted. Therefore, when a machine is
brought up, the BMC watchdog timer must be setup again
before it can be used.</p>

<p>Typically, a BMC watchdog timer is used to automatically
reset a machine that has crashed. When the operating system
first starts up, the BMC timer is set to its initial
countdown value. At periodic inter- vals, when the operating
system is functioning properly, the watchdog timer can be
reset by the OS or a userspace program. Thus, the timer
never counts down to zero. When the system crashes, the
timer cannot be reset by the OS or userspace program.
Eventually, the timer will count- down to zero and reset the
machine.</p>

<p>See EXAMPLES below for examples of how bmc-watchdog is
commonly used.</p>

<p>COMMANDS The following commands are available to
bmc-watchdog.</p>

<p>-s, --set Set BMC Watchdog Configuration. BMC watchdog
timer configuration values can be set using the set command
options listed below under SET OPTIONS. If a particular
configuration parameter is not specified on the command
line, the current configuration of that parameter will not
be changed.</p>

<p>-g, --get Get BMC Watchdog Configuration and State. The
current configura- tion and state is printed to standard
output.</p>

<p>-r, --reset Reset BMC Watchdog Timer.</p>

<p>-t, --start Start BMC Watchdog Timer. Does nothing if
the timer is currently running. Identical to --reset command
when the timer is stopped with the exception of the start
command options listed below under START OPTIONS.</p>

<p>-y, --stop Stop BMC Watchdog Timer. Stops the current
timer.</p>

<p>-c, --clear Clear BMC Watchdog Configuration. Clears all
configuration val- ues for the watchdog timer, except for
timer use, which is kept at its current value.</p>

<p>-d, --daemon Run bmc-watchdog as a daemon. Configurable
BMC watchdog timer options are listed below under DAEMON
OPTIONS. The configuration values are set once, then the
daemon will reset the timer at specified periodic intervals.
The daemon can be stopped using the --stop command, --clear
command, or by setting the stop_timer flag on the --set
command.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS The following options are general
options for configuring IPMI communi- cation and executing
general tool commands. These options are generic and can be
used by any command.</p>

<p>-D IPMIDRIVER, --driver-type=IPMIDRIVER Specify the
driver type to use instead of doing an auto selec- tion. The
currently available inband drivers are KCS, SSIF, OPENIPMI,
and SUNBMC.</p>

<p>--disable-auto-probe Do not probe in-band IPMI devices
for default settings.</p>

<p>--driver-address=DRIVER-ADDRESS Specify the in-band
driver address to be used instead of the probed value.
DRIVER-ADDRESS should be prefixed with &quot;0x&quot; for a
hex value and 0 for an octal value.</p>

<p>--driver-device=DEVICE Specify the in-band driver device
path to be used instead of the probed path.</p>

<p>--register-spacing=REGISTER-SPACING Specify the in-band
driver register spacing instead of the probed value.
Argument is in bytes (i.e. 32bit register spacing = 4)</p>

<p>--target-channel-number=CHANNEL-NUMBER Specify the
in-band driver target channel number to send IPMI requests
to.</p>

<p>--target-slave-address=SLAVE-ADDRESS Specify the in-band
driver target slave number to send IPMI requests to.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose-logging Increase verbosity of logging.</p>

<p>-n, --no-logging Turns off all logging done by
bmc-watchdog.</p>

<p>--config-file=FILE Specify an alternate configuration
file.</p>

<p>-W WORKAROUNDS, --workaround-flags=WORKAROUNDS Specify
workarounds to vendor compliance issues. Multiple
workarounds can be specified separated by commas. A special
com- mand line flag of &quot;none&quot;, will indicate no
workarounds (may be useful for overriding configured
defaults). See WORKAROUNDS below for a list of available
workarounds.</p>

<p>--debug Turn on debugging.</p>

<p>-?, --help Output a help list and exit.</p>

<p>--usage Output a usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Output the program version and exit.</p>

<p>SET OPTIONS The following options can be used by the set
command to set or clear various BMC watchdog configuration
parameters.</p>

<p>-u INT, --timer-use=INT Set timer use. The timer use
value can be set to one of the fol- lowing: 1 = BIOS FRB2, 2
= BIOS POST, 3 = OS_LOAD, 4 = SMS OS, 5 = OEM.</p>

<p>-m INT, --stop-timer=INT Set Stop Timer Flag. A flag
value of 0 stops the current BMC watchdog timer. A value of
1 doesnt turn off the current watch- dog timer.</p>

<p>-l INT, --log=INT Set Log Flag. A flag value of 0 turns
logging on. A value of 1 turns logging off.</p>

<p>-a INT, --timeout-action=INT Set timeout action. The
timeout action can be set to one of the following: 0 = No
action, 1 = Hard Reset, 2 = Power Down, 3 = Power Cycle.</p>

<p>-p INT, --pre-timeout-interrupt=INT Set pre-timeout
interrupt. The pre timeout interrupt can be set to one of
the following: 0 = None, 1 = SMI, 2 = NMI, 3 = Messag- ing
Interrupt.</p>

<p>-z SECONDS, --pre-timeout-interval=SECONDS Set
pre-timeout interval in seconds.</p>

<p>-F, --clear-bios-frb2 Clear BIOS FRB2 Timer Use
Flag.</p>

<p>-P, --clear-bios-post Clear BIOS POST Timer Use
Flag.</p>

<p>-L, --clear-os-load Clear OS Load Timer Use Flag.</p>

<p>-S, --clear-sms-os Clear SMS/OS Timer Use Flag.</p>

<p>-O, --clear-oem Clear OEM Timer Use Flag.</p>

<p>-i SECONDS, --initial-countdown=SECONDS Set initial
countdown in seconds.</p>

<p>-w, --start-after-set Start timer after set command if
timer is stopped. This is typi- cally used when bmc-watchdog
is used as a cronjob. This can be used to automatically
start the timer after it has been set the first time.</p>

<p>-x, --reset-after-set Reset timer after set command if
timer is running.</p>

<p>-j, --start-if-stopped Dont execute set command if timer
is stopped, just start timer.</p>

<p>-k, --reset-if-running Don t execute set command if
timer is running, just reset timer. This is typically used
when bmc-watchdog is used as a cronjob. This can be used to
reset the timer after it has been initially started.</p>

<p>START OPTIONS The following options can be used by the
start command.</p>

<p>-G INT, --gratuitous-arp=INT Suspend or dont suspend
gratuitous ARPs while the BMC timer is running. A flag value

<p>WORKAROUNDS With so many different vendors implementing
their own IPMI solutions, different vendors may implement
their IPMI protocols incorrectly. The following describes a
number of workarounds currently available to han- dle
discovered compliance issues. When possible, workarounds
have been implemented so they will be transparent to the
user. However, some will require the user to specify a
workaround be used via the -W option.</p>

<p>The hardware listed below may only indicate the hardware
that a problem was discovered on. Newer versions of hardware
may fix the problems indicated below. Similar machines from
vendors may or may not exhibit the same problems. Different
vendors may license their firmware from the same IPMI
firmware developer, so it may be worthwhile to try
workarounds listed below even if your motherboard is not
listed.</p>

<p>If you believe your hardware has an additional
compliance issue that needs a workaround to be implemented,
please contact the FreeIPMI main- tainers on
&lt;freeipmi-users@gnu.org&gt; or
&lt;freeipmi-devel@gnu.org&gt;.</p>

<p>assumeio - This workaround flag will assume inband
interfaces communi- cate with system I/O rather than being
memory-mapped. This will work around systems that report
invalid base addresses. Those hitting this issue may see
&quot;device not supported&quot; or &quot;could not find
inband device&quot; errors. Issue observed on HP ProLiant
DL145 G1.</p>

<p>spinpoll - This workaround flag will inform some inband
drivers (most notably the KCS driver) to spin while polling
rather than putting the process to sleep. This may
significantly improve the wall clock running time of tools
because an operating system schedulers granularity may be
much larger than the time it takes to perform a single IPMI
message transaction. However, by spinning, your system may
be performing less useful work by not contexting out the
tool for a more useful task.</p>

<p>ignorestateflag - This workaround option will ignore the
BMC timer state flag (indicating if the timer is running or
stopped) when running in daemon mode. On some BMCs, the flag
is broken and will never report that a BMC timer is running,
even if it is. The workaround will take notice of changes in
the countdown seconds to determine if a timer is running or
stopped. With this type of implementation, the reset-period
must be large enough to ensure minor fluctuations in the
countdown will not affect the workaround. Due to the
implementation of this workaround, if another process stops
the watchdog timer, it may be detectable. This option is
confirmed to work around compliances issues on Sun x4100,
x4200, and x4500.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Setup a bmc-watchdog daemon that resets the
machine after 15 minutes (900 seconds) if the OS has crashed
(see default bmc-watchdog rc script /etc/init.d/bmc-watchdog
for a more complete example): bmc-watchdog -d -u 4 -p 0 -a 1
-i 900</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Upon successful execution, exit status is 0.
On error, exit status is 1.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES Bmc-watchdog may fail to reset the watchdog
timer if it is not sched- uled properly. It is always
recommended that bmc-watchdog be executed with a high
scheduling priority.</p>

<p>On some machines, the hardware based SMI Handler may
disable a proces- sor after a watchdog timer timeout if the
timer use is set to something other than SMS/OS.</p>
