<p>NAME XmGetTearOffControl A RowColumn function that
obtains the widget ID for the tear-off control in a menu</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmGetTearOffControl( Widget menu);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmGetTearOffControl provides the application
with the means for obtain- ing the widget ID of the
internally created tear-off control in a tear- off menu.</p>

<p>RowColumn creates a tear-off control for a PulldownMenu
or PopupMenu when the XmNtearOffModel resource is
initialized or set to XmTEAR_OFF_ENABLED. The tear-off
control is a widget that appears as the first element in the
menu. The user tears off the menu by means of mouse or
keyboard events in the tear-off control.</p>

<p>The tear-off control has Separator-like behavior. Once
the application has obtained the widget ID of the tear-off
control, it can set resources to specify the appearance of
the control. The application or user can also set these
resources in a resource file by using the name of the
control, which is TearOffControl. For a list of the
resources the application or user can set, see
XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>menu Specifies the widget ID of the RowColumn
PulldownMenu or Pop- upMenu</p>

<p>For more information on tear-off menus and a complete
definition of RowColumn and its associated resources, see
XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the widget ID for the tear-off control,
or NULL if no tear-off control exists. An application should
not assume that the returned widget will be of any
particular class.</p>
