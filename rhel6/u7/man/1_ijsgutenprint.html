<p>NAME ijsgutenprint - Ghostscript driver for
Gutenprint</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gs -sDEVICE=ijs
-sIjsServer=/usr/bin/ijsgutenprint -sDeviceManufac-
turer=vendor -sDeviceModel=name [ -dIjsUseOutputFD ]
-sIjsParams=[ key1=value1,keyn=valuen... ] [ options ] [
files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ijsgutenprint provides Ghostscript with a
Gutenprint driver, supporting all printers supported by
libgutenprint.</p>

<p>NOTE: ijsgutenprint should never be called directly.
Ghostscript will run it if the IjsServer parameter is set to
IjsServer=ijsgutenprint when invoking the IJS driver.</p>

<p>NOTE: The only supported method of running ijsgutenprint
is via Foomatic. Users running ghostscript directly will not
be supported. The driver name used by Foomatic is
gutenprint-ijs.5.2.</p>

<p>OPTIONS ijsgutenprint accepts the following Ghostscript
IJS options. The Gutenprint-specific options are not
documented here.</p>

<p>-dIjsUseOutputFD This option should be specified
whenever output from Ghostscript will go to stdout or into a
pipe. It may be specified in all other cases, with only a
slight performance degradation.</p>

<p>-sIjsParams=Option1=Value1,Option2=Value2 This parameter
contains a single string containing a comma-sepa- rated list
of sub-options.</p>

<p>-sDeviceManufacturer=vendor -sDeviceModel=name This
option must be supplied. There is no default. The IJS driver
requires the vendor (it s part of the protocol), but the
ijsgutenprint driver ignores it.</p>

<p>HISTORY The Ghostscript stp driver was originally
written by Henryk Richter (buggs@comlab.uni-rostock.de), and
was integrated into Gutenprint dur- ing the 3.1 development
series. Gutenprint (which was named Gimp-Print prior to
release 5.0) itself was originally written by Michael Sweet
&lt;mike@easysw.com&gt;, who released up to version 2.0;
Robert Krawitz released version 3.0. The Gutenprint
development team (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net) now
maintains the entire package.</p>

<p>The IJS driver was originally written by Russell Lang,
and incorporated into Gutenprint (known then as Gimp-Print)
in early 2002. This driver corresponds with the IJS protocol
0.32.</p>

<p>The stp driver is no longer supported as of Gutenprint
5.0.</p>
