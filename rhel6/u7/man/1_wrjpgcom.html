<p>NAME wrjpgcom - insert text comments into a JPEG
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS wrjpgcom [ -replace ] [ -comment text ] [
-cfile name ] [ filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wrjpgcom reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or
the standard input if no file is named, and generates a new
JPEG/JFIF file on standard output. A comment block is added
to the file.</p>

<p>The JPEG standard allows &quot;comment&quot; (COM)
blocks to occur within a JPEG file. Although the standard
doesnt actually define what COM blocks are for, they are
widely used to hold user-supplied text strings. This lets
you add annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG
files, and later retrieve them as text. COM blocks do not
interfere with the image stored in the JPEG file. The
maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many
of them as you like in one JPEG file.</p>

<p>wrjpgcom adds a COM block, containing text you provide,
to a JPEG file. Ordinarily, the COM block is added after any
existing COM blocks; but you can delete the old COM blocks
if you wish.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Switch names may be abbreviated, and are not
case sensitive.</p>

<p>-replace Delete any existing COM blocks from the
file.</p>

<p>-comment text Supply text for new COM block on command
line.</p>

<p>-cfile name Read text for new COM block from named
file.</p>

<p>If you have only one line of comment text to add, you
can provide it on the command line with -comment. The
comment text must be surrounded with quotes so that it is
treated as a single argument. Longer com- ments can be read
from a text file.</p>

<p>If you give neither -comment nor -cfile, then wrjpgcom
will read the comment text from standard input. (In this
case an input image file name MUST be supplied, so that the
source JPEG file comes from some- where else.) You can enter
multiple lines, up to 64KB worth. Type an end-of-file
indicator (usually control-D) to terminate the comment text
entry.</p>

<p>wrjpgcom will not add a COM block if the provided
comment string is empty. Therefore -replace -comment
&quot;&quot; can be used to delete all COM blocks from a
file.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add a short comment to in.jpg, producing
out.jpg:</p>

<p>wrjpgcom -c &quot;View of my back yard&quot; in.jpg &gt;
out.jpg</p>

<p>Attach a long comment previously stored in
comment.txt:</p>

<p>wrjpgcom in.jpg &lt; comment.txt &gt; out.jpg</p>

<p>or equivalently</p>

<p>wrjpgcom -cfile comment.txt &lt; in.jpg &gt; out.jpg</p>
