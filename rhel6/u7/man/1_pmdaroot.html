<p>NAME pmdaroot - a privileged PMCD helper performance
metrics domain agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/root/pmdaroot [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-s sockname]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaroot is a special Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which cooperates closely with pmcd(1)
and other PMDAs to provide limited privileged services to
these unprivileged processes.</p>

<p>In this role it is used to discover operating system
containers running on the local host. It also enables access
to performance data from within those containers by other
PMDAs running on the bare-metal host, using the
pmdaRootConnect(3) and the associated namespace
interfaces.</p>

<p>Like all other PMDAs, it also exports performance
metrics from the domain it controls. Currently, this is
limited to information about the containers on the local
system, and currently only Docker contain- ers can be
detected.</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named root.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdaroot is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If
the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable, output
is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-s Location of the unix(7) domain socket for
communication with clients seeking privileged operations. By
default, a socket file named $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmcd/root.socket
is used.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Access to the names, help text and values
for the kernel performance metrics is available by default -
unlike most other agents, no action is required to enable
them and they should not be removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/root/help default help text file
for metrics exported by the root PMDA.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/root.log default log file for error
messages and other information from the root PMDA.
$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmcd/root.socket default socket file for
communication with root PMDA clients.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

pmdaRootConnect(3), pcp.conf(5) and unix(7).</p>
