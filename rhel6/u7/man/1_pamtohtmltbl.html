<p>NAME pamtohtmltbl - convert pnm/pam visual image to an
HTML table</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtohtmltbl [-transparent=color] [-verbose]
[file]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtohtmltbl converts a visual image to an HTML table
with one cell per pixel. The cell is empty, but its
background color is that of the pixel.</p>

<p>file is a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM file. If PAM, it must be
a standard visual image of tuple type RGB, GRAYSCALE, or
BLACKANDWHITE, or some- thing equivalent with extra higher
numbered channels, but pamtohtmltbl doesnt check the tuple
type; it just assumes.</p>

<p>Note that the more normal way to include a visual image
in an HTML doc- ument is with a &lt;IMG&gt; tag.</p>

<p>Not all web browsers render tables as pamtohtmltbl
expects, and there- fore show a grossly distorted image.
Internet Explorer 7 on Windows and Opera 9.02 on Windows
have been seen to work; Firefox 2.0.0.16 on the same Windows
system has been seen not to.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -transparent=color This option indicates that
pixels of the specified color are to be transparent in the
HTML table. The table cell for a pixel of this color will
have no background color specified.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine .</p>

<p>-verbose This option causes pamtohtmltbl to display
messages about the conversion process.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtohtmltbl was new in Netpbm 10.15 (April
2003).</p>

<p>AUTHORS Alexander B. Ivanov (SSH) wrote a program he
called pnm2html. Bryan Henderson adapted it to use the
Netpbm libraries and handle PAM images and follow Netpbm
conventions, and named it pamtohtmltbl.</p>
