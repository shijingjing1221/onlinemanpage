<p>NAME units, kilo, kibi, mega, mebi, giga, gibi - decimal
and binary prefixes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Decimal prefixes The SI system of units uses
prefixes that indicate powers of ten. A kilometer is 1000
meter, and a megawatt is 1000000 watt. Below the standard
prefixes.</p>

<p>Prefix Name Value y yocto 10^-24 =
0.000000000000000000000001 z zepto 10^-21 =
0.000000000000000000001 a atto 10^-18 = 0.000000000000000001

0.000001 m milli 10^-3 = 0.001 c centi 10^-2 = 0.01 d deci
10^-1 = 0.1 da deka 10^ 1 = 10 h hecto 10^ 2 = 100 k kilo
10^ 3 = 1000 M mega 10^ 6 = 1000000 G giga 10^ 9 =
1000000000 T tera 10^12 = 1000000000000 P peta 10^15 =
1000000000000000 E exa 10^18 = 1000000000000000000 Z zetta
10^21 = 1000000000000000000000 Y yotta 10^24 =
1000000000000000000000000</p>

<p>The symbol for micro is the Greek letter mu, often
written u in an ASCII context where this Greek letter is not
available. See also</p>

<p>Binary prefixes The binary prefixes resemble the decimal
ones, but have an additional &rsquo;i&rsquo; (and
&quot;Ki&quot; starts with a capital &rsquo;K&rsquo;). The
names are formed by tak- ing the first syllable of the names
of the decimal prefix with roughly the same size, followed
by &quot;bi&quot; for &quot;binary&quot;.</p>

<p>Prefix Name Value Ki kibi 2^10 = 1024 Mi mebi 2^20 =
1048576 Gi gibi 2^30 = 1073741824 Ti tebi 2^40 =
1099511627776 Pi pebi 2^50 = 1125899906842624 Ei exbi 2^60 =
1152921504606846976</p>

<p>Discussion Before these binary prefixes were introduced,
it was fairly common to use k=1000 and K=1024, just like
b=bit, B=byte. Unfortunately, the M is capital already, and
cannot be capitalized to indicate binary-ness.</p>

<p>At first that didn t matter too much, since memory
modules and disks came in sizes that were powers of two, so
everyone knew that in such contexts &quot;kilobyte&quot; and
&quot;megabyte&quot; meant 1024 and 1048576 bytes,
respectively. What originally was a sloppy use of the
prefixes &quot;kilo&quot; and &quot;mega&quot; started to
become regarded as the &quot;real true meaning&quot; when
computers were involved. But then disk technology changed,
and disk sizes became arbitrary numbers. After a period of
uncertainty all disk manufacturers settled on the standard,
namely k=1000, M=1000k, G=1000M.</p>

<p>The situation was messy: in the 14k4 modems, k=1000; in
the 1.44MB diskettes, M=1024000; etc. In 1998 the IEC
approved the standard that defines the binary prefixes given
above, enabling people to be precise and unambiguous.</p>

<p>Thus, today, MB = 1000000B and MiB = 1048576B.</p>

<p>In the free software world programs are slowly being
changed to con- form. When the Linux kernel boots and
says</p>

<p>hda: 120064896 sectors (61473 MB) w/2048KiB Cache</p>

<p>the MB are megabytes and the KiB are kibibytes.</p>
