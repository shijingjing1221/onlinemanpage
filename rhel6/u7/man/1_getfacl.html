<p>GETFACL(1) Access Control Lists GETFACL(1)</p>

<p>NAME getfacl - get file access control lists</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] file ...</p>

<p>getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] -</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For each file, getfacl displays the file
name, owner, the group, and the Access Control List (ACL).
If a directory has a default ACL, get- facl also displays
the default ACL. Non-directories cannot have default
ACLs.</p>

<p>If getfacl is used on a file system that does not
support ACLs, getfacl displays the access permissions
defined by the traditional file mode permission bits.</p>

<p>The output format of getfacl is as follows: 1: # file:
somedir/ 2: # owner: lisa 3: # group: staff 4: # flags: -s-
5: user::rwx 6: user:joe:rwx #effective:r-x 7: group::rwx
#effective:r-x 8: group:cool:r-x 9: mask::r-x 10: other::r-x
11: default:user::rwx 12: default:user:joe:rwx
#effective:r-x 13: default:group::r-x 14: default:mask::r-x
15: default:other::---</p>

<p>Lines 1--3 indicate the file name, owner, and owning
group.</p>

<p>Line 4 indicates the setuid (s), setgid (s), and sticky
(t) bits: either the letter representing the bit, or else a
dash (-). This line is included if any of those bits is set
and left out otherwise, so it will not be shown for most
files. (See CONFORMANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e DRAFT STANDARD 17
below.)</p>

<p>Lines 5, 7 and 10 correspond to the user, group and
other fields of the file mode permission bits. These three
are called the base ACL entries. Lines 6 and 8 are named
user and named group entries. Line 9 is the effective rights
mask. This entry limits the effective rights granted to all
groups and to named users. (The file owner and others
permis- sions are not affected by the effective rights mask;
all other entries are.) Lines 11--15 display the default ACL
associated with this direc- tory. Directories may have a
default ACL. Regular files never have a default ACL.</p>

<p>The default behavior for getfacl is to display both the
ACL and the default ACL, and to include an effective rights
comment for lines where the rights of the entry differ from
the effective rights.</p>

<p>If output is to a terminal, the effective rights comment
is aligned to column 40. Otherwise, a single tab character
separates the ACL entry and the effective rights
comment.</p>

<p>The ACL listings of multiple files are separated by
blank lines. The output of getfacl can also be used as input
to setfacl.</p>

<p>PERMISSIONS Process with search access to a file (i.e.,
processes with read access to the containing directory of a
file) are also granted read access to the files ACLs. This
is analogous to the permissions required for accessing the
file mode.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --access Display the file access control
list.</p>

<p>-d, --default Display the default access control
list.</p>

<p>-c, --omit-header Do not display the comment header (the
first three lines of each files output).</p>

<p>-e, --all-effective Print all effective rights comments,
even if identical to the rights defined by the ACL
entry.</p>

<p>-E, --no-effective Do not print effective rights
comments.</p>

<p>-s, --skip-base Skip files that only have the base ACL
entries (owner, group, oth- ers).</p>

<p>-R, --recursive List the ACLs of all files and
directories recursively.</p>

<p>-L, --logical Logical walk, follow symbolic links to
directories. The default behavior is to follow symbolic link
arguments, and skip symbolic links encountered in
subdirectories. Only effective in combination with -R.</p>

<p>-P, --physical Physical walk, do not follow symbolic
links to directories. This also skips symbolic link
arguments. Only effective in combination with -R.</p>

<p>-t, --tabular Use an alternative tabular output format.
The ACL and the default ACL are displayed side by side.
Permissions that are ineffective due to the ACL mask entry
are displayed capitalized. The entry tag names for the
ACL_USER_OBJ and ACL_GROUP_OBJ entries are also dis- played
in capital letters, which helps in spotting those
entries.</p>

<p>-p, --absolute-names Do not strip leading slash
characters ( / ). The default behavior is to strip leading
slash characters.</p>

<p>-n, --numeric List numeric user and group IDs</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version of getfacl and exit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help explaining the command line
options.</p>

<p>-- End of command line options. All remaining parameters
are inter- preted as file names, even if they start with a
dash character.</p>

<p>- If the file name parameter is a single dash character,
getfacl reads a list of files from standard input.</p>

<p>CONFORMANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e DRAFT STANDARD 17 If the
environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, the default
behavior of getfacl changes in the following ways: Unless
otherwise specified, only the ACL is printed. The default
ACL is only printed if the -d option is given. If no command
line parameter is given, getfacl behaves as if it was
invoked as getfacl -. No flags comments indi- cating the
setuid, setgit, and sticky bits are generated.</p>
