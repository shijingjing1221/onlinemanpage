<p>NAME lefty - A Programmable Graphics Editor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lefty [ options ] [ file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lefty is a two-view graphics editor for
technical pictures. This editor has no hardwired knowledge
about specific picture layouts or editing operations. Each
picture is described by a program that contains func- tions
to draw the picture and functions to perform editing
operations that are appropriate for the specific picture.
Primitive user actions, like mouse and keyboard events, are
also bound to functions in this program. Besides the
graphical view of the picture itself, the editor presents a
textual view of the program that describes the picture. Pro-
grammability and the two-view interface allow the editor to
handle a variety of pictures, but are particularly useful
for pictures used in technical contexts, e.g., graphs and
trees. Also, lefty can communicate with other processes.
This feature allows it to use existing tools to compute
specific picture layouts and allows external processes to
use the editor as a front end to display their data
structures graphically.</p>

<p>USAGE The file name is optional. It may be -, for
reading from standard input. lefty uses two environment
variables, LEFTYPATH and LEFTYOP- TIONS. LEFTYPATH is a
colon separated list of directories. When lefty tries to
open a file, it searches that path for the file. When lefty
tries to start up another process, it searches LEFTYPATH
first, then the standard PATH variable. LEFTYOPTIONS can be
used to set specific options. Options specified on the
command line override options set through this variable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -x Instructs the editor to exit after processing
file.</p>

<p>-e &lt;expression&gt; &lt;expression&gt; is parsed and
executed.</p>

<p>-el &lt;num&gt; Set error reporting level. The default
value is 0. 0 never prints any messages. 1 prints severe
errors, such as trying to return from a non function. 2 is
the most useful: it reports function calls that cannot be
executed, either because there is no function, or because of
argument mismatches. 3 also warns about bad variable names.
4,5 warn about expressions that do not return a value. Only
level 1 messages are real errors. The rest arise from legal
lefty statements, but may be cased by some logic errors.</p>

<p>-sd &lt;num&gt; Specifies how much of the stack to show,
when an error message is to be printed. The default value is
2. With 0, no part of the stack is shown. With 1, only the
top stack frame is printed. With 2, the full stack is
printed.</p>

<p>-sb &lt;num&gt; Specifies how much of each function in
the stack to show, when an error message is to be printed.
The default value is 2. With 0, no part of the function is
shown. With 1, only the line around the error is printed.
With 2, the full function body is printed.</p>

<p>-df &lt;string&gt; Sets the default font. This font is
used whenever a requested font cannot be found. The string
must be a legal X font. If string is , lefty will draw small
boxes instead of text.</p>

<p>-ps &lt;file&gt; Specifies a default file name for
postscript files. This name is used when no name is
specified in the createwidget call. The default file name is
out.ps.</p>

<p>-V Prints the version.</p>
