<p>FWIDE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FWIDE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fwide - set stream orientation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fwide(FILE *stream, int mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fwide() function shall determine the
orientation of the stream pointed to by stream. If mode is
greater than zero, the function first attempts to make the
stream wide-oriented. If mode is less than zero, the
function first attempts to make the stream byte-oriented.
Other- wise, mode is zero and the function does not alter
the orientation of the stream.</p>

<p>If the orientation of the stream has already been
determined, fwide() shall not change it.</p>

<p>Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error,
an application wishing to check for error situations should
set errno to 0, then call fwide(), then check errno, and if
it is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The fwide() function shall return a value
greater than zero if, after the call, the stream has
wide-orientation, a value less than zero if the stream has
byte-orientation, or zero if the stream has no orienta-
tion.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fwide() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The stream argument is not a valid stream.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE A call to fwide() with mode set to
zero can be used to determine the current orientation of a
stream.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
