<p>NAME slappasswd - OpenLDAP password utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/slappasswd [-v] [-u] [-g|-s secret|-T
file] [-h hash] [-c salt-format] [-n] [-o
option[=value]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Slappasswd is used to generate an
userPassword value suitable for use with ldapmodify(1),
slapd.conf(5) rootpw configuration directive or the
slapd-config(5) olcRootPW configuration directive.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v enable verbose mode.</p>

<p>-u Generate RFC 2307 userPassword values (the default).
Future versions of this program may generate alternative
syntaxes by default. This option is provided for forward
compatibility.</p>

<p>-s secret The secret to hash. If this, -g and -T are
absent, the user will be prompted for the secret to hash.
-s, -g and -T are mutually exclusive flags.</p>

<p>-g Generate the secret. If this, -s and -T are absent,
the user will be prompted for the secret to hash. -s, -g and
-T are mutually exclusive flags. If this is present,
{CLEARTEXT} is used as scheme. -g and -h are mutually
exclusive flags.</p>

<p>-T &quot;file&quot; Hash the contents of the file. If
this, -g and -s are absent, the user will be prompted for
the secret to hash. -s, -g and -T and mutually exclusive
flags.</p>

<p>-h &quot;scheme&quot; If -h is specified, one of the
following RFC 2307 schemes may be specified: {CRYPT}, {MD5},
{SMD5}, {SSHA}, and {SHA}. The default is {SSHA}.</p>

<p>Note that scheme names may need to be protected, due to
{ and }, from expansion by the users command
interpreter.</p>

<p>{SHA} and {SSHA} use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1),
the lat- ter with a seed.</p>

<p>{MD5} and {SMD5} use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the
latter with a seed.</p>

<p>{CRYPT} uses the crypt(3).</p>

<p>{CLEARTEXT} indicates that the new password should be
added to userPassword as clear text. Unless {CLEARTEXT} is
used, this flag is incompatible with option -g.</p>

<p>-c crypt-salt-format Specify the format of the salt
passed to crypt(3) when generat- ing {CRYPT} passwords. This
string needs to be in sprintf(3) format and may include one
(and only one) %s conversion. This conversion will be
substituted with a string of random charac- ters from
[A-Za-z0-9./]. For example, %.2s provides a two character
salt and $1$%.8s tells some versions of crypt(3) to use an
MD5 algorithm and provides 8 random characters of salt. The
default is %s, which provides 31 characters of salt.</p>

<p>-n Omit the trailing newline; useful to pipe the
credentials into a command.</p>

<p>-o option[=value] Specify an option with a(n optional)
value. Possible generic options/values are:</p>

<p>module-path=&lt;pathspec&gt; (see modulepath in
slapd.conf(5)) module-load=&lt;filename&gt; (see moduleload
in slapd.conf(5))</p>

<p>You can load a dynamically loadable password hash module
by using this option.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The practice of storing hashed passwords in
userPassword violates Stan- dard Track (RFC 4519) schema
specifications and may hinder interoper- ability. A new
attribute type, authPassword, to hold hashed passwords has
been defined (RFC 3112), but is not yet implemented in
slapd(8).</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the behavior of crypt(3) is
platform spe- cific.</p>

<p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Use of hashed passwords does not
protect passwords during protocol transfer. TLS or other
eavesdropping protections should be in-place before using
LDAP simple bind.</p>

<p>The hashed password values should be protected as if
they were clear text passwords.</p>
