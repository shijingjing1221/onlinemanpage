<p>XResourceManagerString(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XResourceManagerString(3)</p>

<p>NAME XResourceManagerString, XScreenResourceString -
obtain server resource properties</p>

<p>SYNTAX char *XResourceManagerString(Display
*display);</p>

<p>char *XScreenResourceString(Screen *screen);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>screen Specifies the screen.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XResourceManagerString function returns
the RESOURCE_MANAGER prop- erty from the servers root window
of screen zero, which was returned when the connection was
opened using XOpenDisplay. The property is converted from
type STRING to the current locale. The conversion is
identical to that produced by XmbTextPropertyToTextList for
a single element STRING property. The returned string is
owned by Xlib and should not be freed by the client. The
property value must be in a format that is acceptable to
XrmGetStringDatabase. If no property exists, NULL is
returned.</p>

<p>The XScreenResourceString function returns the
SCREEN_RESOURCES prop- erty from the root window of the
specified screen. The property is converted from type STRING
to the current locale. The conversion is identical to that
produced by XmbTextPropertyToTextList for a single element
STRING property. The property value must be in a format that
is acceptable to XrmGetStringDatabase. If no property
exists, NULL is returned. The caller is responsible for
freeing the returned string by using XFree.</p>
