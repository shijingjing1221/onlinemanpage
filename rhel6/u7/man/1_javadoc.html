<p>javadoc(1) javadoc(1)</p>

<p>Name javadoc - The Java API Documentation Generator</p>

<p>Generates HTML pages of API documentation from Java
source files. This document contains Javadoc examples for
Solaris.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS javadoc [ options ] [ packagenames ] [
sourcefilenames ] [ -subpack- ages pkg1:pkg2:... ] [
@argfiles ]</p>

<p>Arguments can be in any order. See processing of Source
Files for details on how the Javadoc tool determines which
&quot;.java&quot; files to pro- cess.</p>

<p>options Command-line options, as specified in this
document. To see a typical use of javadoc options, see
Real-World Example.</p>

<p>packagenames A series of names of packages, separated by
spaces, such as java.lang java.lang.reflect java.awt. You
must separately specify each package you want to document.
Wildcards are not allowed; use -subpackages for recursion.
The Javadoc tool uses -sourcepath to look for these package
names. See Example - Documenting One or More Packages</p>

<p>sourcefilenames A series of source file names, separated
by spaces, each of which can begin with a path and contain a
wildcard such as asterisk (*). The Javadoc tool will process
every file whose name ends with &quot;.java&quot;, and whose
name, when stripped of that suffix, is actually a legal
class name (see the Java Language Specifica- tion).
Therefore, you can name files with dashes (such as
X-Buffer), or other illegal characters, to prevent them from
being documented. This is useful for test files and template
files The path that precedes the source file name determines
where javadoc will look for the file. (The Javadoc tool does
not use -sourcepath to look for these source file names.)
Relative paths are relative to the current directory, so
passing in But- ton.java is identical to ./Button.java. A
source file name with an absolute path and a wildcard, for
example, is /home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java. See Example -
Documenting One or More Classes. You can also mix
packagenames and sourcefile- names, as in Example -
Documenting Both Packages and Classes</p>

<p>-subpackages pkg1:pkg2:... Generates documentation from
source files in the specified pack- ages and recursively in
their subpackages. An alternative to sup- plying
packagenames or sourcefilenames.</p>

<p>@argfiles One or more files that contain a list of
Javadoc options, packa- genames and sourcefilenames in any
order. Wildcards (*) and -J options are not allowed in these
files.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Javadoc tool parses the declarations and
documentation comments in a set of Java source files and
produces a corresponding set of HTML pages describing (by
default) the public and protected classes, nested classes
(but not anonymous inner classes), interfaces, constructors,
methods, and fields. You can use it to generate the API
(Application Programming Interface) documentation or the
implementation documentation for a set of source files.</p>

<p>You can run the Javadoc tool on entire packages,
individual source files, or both. When documenting entire
packages, you can either use -subpackages for traversing
recursively down from a top-level direc- tory, or pass in an
explicit list of package names. When documenting individual
source files, you pass in a list of source (.java) file-
names. Examples are given at the end of this document. How
Javadoc pro- cesses source files is covered next.</p>

<p>Processing of source files The Javadoc tool processes
files that end in &quot;.java&quot; plus other files
described under Source Files. If you run the Javadoc tool by
explicitly passing in individual source filenames, you can
determine exactly which &quot;.java&quot; files are
processed. However, that is not how most developers want to
work, as it is simpler to pass in package names. The Javadoc
tool can be run three ways without explicitly specifying the
source filenames. You can (1) pass in package names, (2) use
-subpackages, and (3) use wildcards with source filenames
(*.java). In these cases, the Javadoc tool processes a
&quot;.java&quot; file only if it fulfills all of the
following requirements:</p>

<p>o Its name, after stripping off the &quot;.java&quot;
suffix, is actually a legal class name (see the Java
Language Specification for legal characters)</p>

<p>o Its directory path relative to the root of the source
tree is actually a legal package name (after converting its
separators to dots)</p>

<p>o Its package statement contains the legal package name
(specified in the previous bullet)</p>

<p>Processing of links - During a run, the Javadoc tool
automatically adds cross-reference links to package, class
and member names that are being documented as part of that
run. Links appear in several places:</p>

<p>o Declarations (return types, argument types, field
types)</p>

<p>o &quot;See Also&quot; sections generated from @see
tags</p>

<p>o In-line text generated from {@link} tags</p>

<p>o Exception names generated from @throws tags</p>

<p>o &quot;Specified by&quot; links to members in
interfaces and &quot;Overrides&quot; links to members in
classes</p>

<p>o Summary tables listing packages, classes and
members</p>

<p>o Package and class inheritance trees</p>

<p>o The index</p>

<p>You can add hyperlinks to existing text for classes not
included on the command line (but generated separately) by
way of the -link and -linkoffline options.</p>

<p>Other processing details - The Javadoc tool produces one
complete docu- ment each time it is run; it cannot do
incremental builds -- that is, it cannot modify or directly
incorporate results from previous runs of the Javadoc tool.
However, it can link to results from other runs, as just
mentioned.</p>

<p>As implemented, the Javadoc tool requires and relies on
the java com- piler to do its job. The Javadoc tool calls
part of javac to compile the declarations, ignoring the
member implementation. It builds a rich internal
representation of the classes, including the class
hierarchy, and &quot;use&quot; relationships, then generates
the HTML from that. The Javadoc tool also picks up
user-supplied documentation from documentation com- ments in
the source code.</p>

<p>In fact, the Javadoc tool will run on .java source files
that are pure stub files with no method bodies. This means
you can write documenta- tion comments and run the Javadoc
tool in the earliest stages of design while creating the
API, before writing the implementation.</p>

<p>Relying on the compiler ensures that the HTML output
corresponds exactly with the actual implementation, which
may rely on implicit, rather than explicit, source code. For
example, the Javadoc tool docu- ments default constructors
(see Java Language Specification) that are present in the
.class files but not in the source code.</p>

<p>In many cases, the Javadoc tool allows you to generate
documentation for source files whose code is incomplete or
erroneous. This is a bene- fit that enables you to generate
documentation before all debugging and troubleshooting is
done. For example, according to the Java Language
Specification, a class that contains an abstract method
should itself be declared abstract. The Javadoc tool does
not check for this, and would proceed without a warning,
whereas the javac compiler stops on this error. The Javadoc
tool does do some primitive checking of doc comments. Use
the DocCheck doclet to check the doc comments more thor-
oughly.</p>

<p>When the Javadoc tool builds its internal structure for
the documenta- tion, it loads all referenced classes.
Because of this, the Javadoc tool must be able to find all
referenced classes, whether bootstrap classes, extensions,
or user classes. For more about this, see How Classes Are
Found @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/finding-
classes.html. Generally speaking, classes you create must
either be loaded as an extension or in the Javadoc tools
class path.</p>

<p>Javadoc Doclets You can customize the content and format
of the Javadoc tools output by using doclets. The Javadoc
tool has a default &quot;built-in&quot; doclet, called the
standard doclet, that generates HTML-formatted API documen-
tation. You can modify or subclass the standard doclet, or
write your own doclet to generate HTML, XML, MIF, RTF or
whatever output format youd like. Information about doclets
and their use is at the following locations:</p>

<p>o Javadoc Doclets @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/javadoc/index.html</p>

<p>o The -doclet command-line option</p>

<p>When a custom doclet is not specified with the -doclet
command line option, the Javadoc tool will use the default
standard doclet. The javadoc tool has several command line
options that are available regardless of which doclet is
being used. The standard doclet adds a supplementary set of
command line options. Both sets of options are described
below in the options section.</p>

tion/index-137868.html for more information about Sun
conventions for writing documentation comments.</p>

<p>o Requirements for Writing API Specifications @
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingapispecs/index.html
- Standard requirements used when writing the Java SE
Platform Spec- ification. It can be useful whether you are
writing API specifica- tions in source file documentation
comments or in other formats. It covers requirements for
packages, classes, interfaces, fields and methods to satisfy
testable assertions.</p>

<p>o Documentation Comment Specification @
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/first_edition/html/18.doc.html
- The original specification on documentation comments,
Chapter 18, Documentation Comments, in the Java Language
Specification, First Edition, by James Gosling, Bill Joy,
and Guy Steele. (This chapter was removed from the second
edition.)</p>

<p>o DocCheck Doclet @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-141437.html - Checks doc comments in source files
and generates a report listing the errors and irregularities
it finds. It is part of the Doc Check Utilities.</p>

<p>o MIF Doclet @
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/mifdoclet/ - Can automate
the generation of API documentation in MIF, FrameMaker and
PDF for- mats. MIF is Adobe FrameMakers interchange
format.</p>

<p>Terminology The terms documentation comment, doc
comment, main description, tag, block tag, and in-line tag
are described at Documentation Comments. These other terms
have specific meanings within the context of the Javadoc
tool:</p>

<p>generated document The document generated by the javadoc
tool from the doc comments in Java source code. The default
generated document is in HTML and is created by the standard
doclet.</p>

<p>name A name of a program element written in the Java
Language -- that is, the name of a package, class,
interface, field, constructor or method. A name can be
fully-qualified, such as
java.lang.String.equals(java.lang.Object), or
partially-quali- fied, such as equals(Object).</p>

<p>documented classes The classes and interfaces for which
detailed documentation is generated during a javadoc run. To
be documented, the source files must be available, their
source filenames or package names must be passed into the
javadoc command, and they must not be filtered out by their
access modifier (public, protected, pack- age-private or
private). We also refer to these as the classes included in
the javadoc output, or the included classes.</p>

<p>included classes Classes and interfaces whose details
are documented during a run of the Javadoc tool. Same as
documented classes.</p>

<p>excluded classes Classes and interfaces whose details
are not documented during a run of the Javadoc tool.</p>

<p>referenced classes The classes and interfaces that are
explicitly referred to in the definition (implementation) or
doc comments of the documented classes and interfaces.
Examples of references include return type, parameter type,
cast type, extended class, implemented interface, imported
classes, classes used in method bodies, @see, {@link},
{@linkplain}, and {@inheritDoc} tags. (Notice this defi-
nition has changed since 1.3 @ http://docs.ora-
cle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html#referenced-
classes.) When the Javadoc tool is run, it should load into
mem- ory all of the referenced classes in javadoc s
bootclasspath and classpath. (The Javadoc tool prints a
&quot;Class not found&quot; warning for referenced classes
not found.) The Javadoc tool can derive enough information
from the .class files to determine their exis- tence and the
fully-qualified names of their members.</p>

<p>external referenced classes The referenced classes whose
documentation is not being generated during a javadoc run.
In other words, these classes are not passed into the
Javadoc tool on the command line. Links in the generated
documentation to those classes are said to be external
references or external links. For example, if you run the
Javadoc tool on only the java.awt package, then any class in
java.lang, such as Object, is an external referenced class.
External refer- enced classes can be linked to using the
-link and -linkoffline options. An important property of an
external referenced class is that its source comments are
normally not available to the Javadoc run. In this case,
these comments cannot be inherited.</p>

<p>SOURCE FILES The Javadoc tool will generate output
originating from four different types of &quot;source&quot;
files: Java language source files for classes (.java),
package comment files, overview comment files, and miscella-
neous unprocessed files. This section also covers test files
and tem- plate files that can also be in the source tree,
but which you want to be sure not to document.</p>

<p>Class Source Code Files Each class or interface and its
members can have their own documenta- tion comments,
contained in a .java file. For more details about these doc
comments, see Documentation Comments.</p>

<p>Package Comment Files Each package can have its own
documentation comment, contained in its own
&quot;source&quot; file, that the Javadoc tool will merge
into the package summary page that it generates. You
typically include in this comment any documentation that
applies to the entire package.</p>

<p>To create a package comment file, you have a choice of
two files to place your comments:</p>

<p>o package-info.java - Can contain a package declaration,
package annotations, package comments and Javadoc tags. This
file is gen- erally preferred over package.html.</p>

<p>o package.html - Can contain only package comments and
Javadoc tags, no package annotations.</p>

<p>A package may have a single package.html file or a
single pack- age-info.java file but not both. Place either
file in the package directory in the source tree along with
your .java files.</p>

<p>package-info.java - This file can contain a package
comment of the fol- lowing structure -- the comment is
placed before the package declara- tion:</p>

<p>File: java/applet/package-info.java</p>

<p>/** * Provides the classes necessary to create an *
applet and the classes an applet uses * to communicate with
its applet context. * &lt;p&gt; * The applet framework
involves two entities: * the applet and the applet context.
* An applet is an embeddable window (see the * {@link
java.awt.Panel} class) with a few extra * methods that the
applet context can use to * initialize, start, and stop the
applet. * * @since 1.0 * @see java.awt */ package
java.lang.applet;</p>

<p>Note that while the comment separators /** and /* must
be present, the leading asterisks on the intermediate lines
can be omitted.</p>

<p>package.html - This file can contain a package comment
of the following structure -- the comment is placed in the
&lt;body&gt; element:</p>

<p>File: java/applet/package.html</p>

<p>&lt;HTML&gt; &lt;BODY&gt; Provides the classes necessary
to create an applet and the classes an applet uses to
communicate with its applet context. &lt;p&gt; The applet
framework involves two entities: the applet and the applet
context. An applet is an embeddable window (see the {@link
java.awt.Panel} class) with a few extra methods that the
applet context can use to initialize, start, and stop the
applet.</p>

<p>@since 1.0 @see java.awt &lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt;</p>

<p>Notice this is just a normal HTML file and does not
include a package declaration. The content of the package
comment file is written in HTML, like all other comments,
with one exception: The documentation comment should not
include the comment separators /** and */ or leading
asterisks. When writing the comment, you should make the
first sentence a summary about the package, and not put a
title or any other text between &lt;body&gt; and the first
sentence. You can include package tags; as with any
documentation comment, all block tags must appear after the
main description. If you add a @see tag in a package comment
file, it must have a fully-qualified name. For more details,
see the example of package.html @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#packagecomments.</p>

<p>Processing of package comment file - When the Javadoc
tool runs, it will automatically look for the package
comment file; if found, the Javadoc tool does the
following:</p>

<p>o Copies the comment for processing. (For package.html,
copies all content between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;
HTML tags. You can include a &lt;head&gt; section to put a
&lt;title&gt;, source file copyright statement, or other
information, but none of these will appear in the gener-
ated documentation.)</p>

<p>o Processes any package tags that are present.</p>

<p>o Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the
package summary page it generates, as shown in Package
Summary @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/applet/package-sum-
mary.html.</p>

<p>o Copies the first sentence of the package comment to
the top of the package summary page. It also adds the
package name and this first sentence to the list of packages
on the overview page, as shown in Overview Summary @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html.
The end-of-sentence is determined by the same rules used for
the end of the first sentence of class and member main
descriptions.</p>

<p>Overview Comment File Each application or set of
packages that you are documenting can have its own overview
documentation comment, kept in its own &quot;source&quot;
file, that the Javadoc tool will merge into the overview
page that it gener- ates. You typically include in this
comment any documentation that applies to the entire
application or set of packages.</p>

<p>To create an overview comment file, you can name the
file anything you want, typically overview.html and place it
anywhere, typically at the top level of the source tree. For
example, if the source files for the java.applet package are
contained in /home/user/src/java/applet direc- tory, you
could create an overview comment file at
/home/user/src/overview.html.</p>

<p>Notice you can have multiple overview comment files for
the same set of source files, in case you want to run
javadoc multiple times on differ- ent sets of packages. For
example, you could run javadoc once with -private for
internal documentation and again without that option for
public documentation. In this case, you could describe the
documenta- tion as public or internal in the first sentence
of each overview com- ment file.</p>

<p>The content of the overview comment file is one big
documentation com- ment, written in HTML, like the package
comment file described previ- ously. See that description
for details. To re-iterate, when writing the comment, you
should make the first sentence a summary about the
application or set of packages, and not put a title or any
other text between &lt;body&gt; and the first sentence. You
can include overview tags; as with any documentation
comment, all tags except in-line tags, such as {@link}, must
appear after the main description. If you add a @see tag, it
must have a fully-qualified name.</p>

<p>When you run the Javadoc tool, you specify the overview
comment file name with the -overview option. The file is
then processed similar to that of a package comment
file.</p>

<p>o Copies all content between &lt;body&gt; and
&lt;/body&gt; tags for processing.</p>

<p>o Processes any overview tags that are present.</p>

<p>o Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the
overview page it generates, as shown in Overview Summary @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html.</p>

<p>o Copies the first sentence of the overview comment to
the top of the overview summary page.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Unprocessed Files You can also include in
your source any miscellaneous files that you want the
Javadoc tool to copy to the destination directory. These
typi- cally includes graphic files, example Java source
(.java) and class (.class) files, and self-standing HTML
files whose content would over- whelm the documentation
comment of a normal Java source file.</p>

<p>To include unprocessed files, put them in a directory
called doc-files which can be a subdirectory of any package
directory that contains source files. You can have one such
subdirectory for each package. You might include images,
example code, source files, .class files, applets and HTML
files. For example, if you want to include the image of a
but- ton button.gif in the java.awt.Button class
documentation, you place that file in the
/home/user/src/java/awt/doc-files/ directory. Notice the
doc-files directory should not be located at
/home/user/src/java/doc-files because java is not a package
-- that is, it does not directly contain any source
files.</p>

<p>All links to these unprocessed files must be hard-coded,
because the Javadoc tool does not look at the files -- it
simply copies the direc- tory and all its contents to the
destination. For example, the link in the Button.java doc
comment might look like:</p>

<p>/** * This button looks like this: * &lt;img
src=&quot;doc-files/Button.gif&quot;&gt; */</p>

<p>Test Files and Template Files Some developers have
indicated they want to store test files and tem- plates
files in the source tree near their corresponding source
files. That is, they would like to put them in the same
directory, or a subdi- rectory, of those source files.</p>

<p>If you run the Javadoc tool by explicitly passing in
individual source filenames, you can deliberately omit test
and templates files and pre- vent them from being processed.
However, if you are passing in package names or wildcards,
you need to follow certain rules to ensure these test files
and templates files are not processed.</p>

<p>Test files differ from template files in that the former
are legal, compilable source files, while the latter are
not, but may end with &quot;.java&quot;.</p>

<p>Test files - Often developers want to put compilable,
runnable test files for a given package in the same
directory as the source files for that package. But they
want the test files to belong to a package other than the
source file package, such as the unnamed package (so the
test files have no package statement or a different package
statement from the source). In this scenario, when the
source is being documented by specifying its package name
specified on the command line, the test files will cause
warnings or errors. You need to put such test files in a
subdirectory. For example, if you want to add test files for
source files in com.package1, put them in a subdirectory
that would be an invalid package name (because it contains a
hyphen):</p>

<p>com/package1/test-files/</p>

<p>The test directory will be skipped by the Javadoc tool
with no warn- ings.</p>

<p>If your test files contain doc comments, you can set up
a separate run of the Javadoc tool to produce documentation
of the test files by pass- ing in their test source
filenames with wildcards, such as com/pack-
age1/test-files/*.java.</p>

<p>Templates for source files - Template files have names
that often end in &quot;.java&quot; and are not compilable.
If you have a template for a source file that you want to
keep in the source directory, you can name it with a dash
(such as Buffer-Template.java), or any other illegal Java
character, to prevent it from being processed. This relies
on the fact that the Javadoc tool will only process source
files whose name, when stripped of the &quot;.java&quot;
suffix, is actually a legal class name (see information
about Identifiers in the Java Language Specification).</p>

<p>GENERATED FILES By default, javadoc uses a standard
doclet that generates HTML-format- ted documentation. This
doclet generates the following kinds of files (where each
HTML &quot;page&quot; corresponds to a separate file). Note
that javadoc generates files with two types of names: those
named after classes/interfaces, and those that are not (such
as package-sum- mary.html). Files in the latter group
contain hyphens to prevent file- name conflicts with those
in the former group.</p>

<p>Basic Content Pages</p>

<p>o One class or interface page (classname.html) for each
class or interface it is documenting.</p>

<p>o One package page (package-summary.html) for each
package it is documenting. The Javadoc tool will include any
HTML text provided in a file named package.html or
package-info.java in the package directory of the source
tree.</p>

<p>o One overview page (overview-summary.html) for the
entire set of packages. This is the front page of the
generated document. The Javadoc tool will include any HTML
text provided in a file speci- fied with the -overview
option. Note that this file is created only if you pass into
javadoc two or more package names. For fur- ther
explanation, see HTML Frames.)</p>

<p>Cross-Reference Pages</p>

<p>o One class hierarchy page for the entire set of
packages (overview-tree.html). To view this, click on
&quot;Overview&quot; in the navigation bar, then click on
&quot;Tree&quot;.</p>

<p>o One class hierarchy page for each package
(package-tree.html) To view this, go to a particular
package, class or interface page; click &quot;Tree&quot; to
display the hierarchy for that package.</p>

<p>o One &quot;use&quot; page for each package
(package-use.html) and a separate one for each class and
interface (class-use/classname.html). This page describes
what packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields use
any part of the given class, interface or package. Given a
class or interface A, its &quot;use&quot; page includes
subclasses of A, fields declared as A, methods that return
A, and methods and constructors with parameters of type A.
You can access this page by first going to the package,
class or interface, then clicking on the &quot;Use&quot;
link in the navigation bar.</p>

<p>o A deprecated API page (deprecated-list.html) listing
all depre- cated names. (A deprecated name is not
recommended for use, gener- ally due to improvements, and a
replacement name is usually given. Deprecated APIs may be
removed in future implementations.)</p>

<p>o A constant field values page (constant-values.html)
for the values of static fields.</p>

<p>o A serialized form page (serialized-form.html) for
information about serializable and externalizable classes.
Each such class has a description of its serialization
fields and methods. This infor- mation is of interest to
re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While
there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this
information by going to any serialized class and clicking
&quot;Serialized Form&quot; in the &quot;See also&quot;
section of the class comment. The standard doclet
automatically generates a serialized form page: any class
(public or non-public) that implements Serializ- able is
included, along with readObject and writeObject methods, the
fields that are serialized, and the doc comments from the
@serial, @serialField, and @serialData tags. Public
serializable classes can be excluded by marking them (or
their package) with @serial exclude, and package-private
serializable classes can be included by marking them (or
their package) with @serial include. As of 1.4, you can
generate the complete serialized form for pub- lic and
private classes by running javadoc without specifying the
-private option.</p>

<p>o An index (index-*.html) of all class, interface,
constructor, field and method names, alphabetically
arranged. This is interna- tionalized for Unicode and can be
generated as a single file or as a separate file for each
starting character (such as A-Z for English).</p>

<p>Support Files</p>

<p>o A help page (help-doc.html) that describes the
navigation bar and the above pages. You can provide your own
custom help file to override the default using
-helpfile.</p>

<p>o One index.html file which creates the HTML frames for
display. This is the file you load to display the front page
with frames. This file itself contains no text content.</p>

<p>o Several frame files (*-frame.html) containing lists of
packages, classes and interfaces, used when HTML frames are
being displayed.</p>

<p>o A package list file (package-list), used by the -link
and -linkof- fline options. This is a text file, not HTML,
and is not reachable through any links.</p>

<p>o A style sheet file (stylesheet.css) that controls a
limited amount of color, font family, font size, font style
and positioning on the generated pages.</p>

<p>o A doc-files directory that holds any image, example,
source code or other files that you want copied to the
destination directory. These files are not processed by the
Javadoc tool in any manner -- that is, any javadoc tags in
them will be ignored. This directory is not generated unless
it exists in the source tree.</p>

<p>HTML Frames</p>

<p>The Javadoc tool will generate either two or three HTML
frames, as shown in the figure below. It creates the minimum
necessary number of frames by omitting the list of packages
if there is only one package (or no packages). That is, when
you pass a single package name or source files (*.java)
belonging to a single package as arguments into the javadoc
command, it will create only one frame (C) in the left-hand
column -- the list of classes. When you pass into javadoc
two or more package names, it creates a third frame (P)
listing all packages, as well as an overview page (Detail).
This overview page has the filename overview-summary.html.
Thus, this file is created only if you pass in two or more
package names. You can bypass frames by clicking on the
&quot;No Frames&quot; link or entering at
overview-summary.html.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with HTML frames, you should be
aware that frames can have focus for printing and scrolling.
To give a frame focus, click on it. Then on many browsers
the arrow keys and page keys will scroll that frame, and the
print menu command will print it.</p>

<p>Load one of the following two files as the starting page
depending on whether you want HTML frames or not:</p>

<p>o index.html (for frames)</p>

<p>o overview-summary.html (for no frames)</p>

<p>Generated File Structure</p>

<p>The generated class and interface files are organized in
the same directory hierarchy that Java source files and
class files are orga- nized. This structure is one directory
per subpackage.</p>

<p>For example, the document generated for the class
java.applet.Applet class would be located at
java/applet/Applet.html. The file structure for the
java.applet package follows, given that the destination
direc- tory is named apidocs. All files that contain the
word &quot;frame&quot; appear in the upper-left or
lower-left frames, as noted. All other HTML files appear in
the right-hand frame.</p>

<p>NOTE - Directories are shown in bold. The asterisks (*)
indicate the files and directories that are omitted when the
arguments to javadoc are source filenames (*.java) rather
than package names. Also when arguments are source
filenames, package-list is created but is empty. The
doc-files directory will not be created in the destination
unless it exists in the source tree.</p>

<p>Generated API Declarations The Javadoc tool generates a
declaration at the start of each class, interface, field,
constructor, and method description for that API item. For
example, the declaration for the Boolean class is:</p>

<p>public final class Boolean extends Object implements
Serializable</p>

<p>and the declaration for the Boolean.valueOfmethod
is:</p>

<p>public static Boolean valueOf(String s)</p>

<p>The Javadoc tool can include the modifiers public,
protected, private, abstract, final, static, transient, and
volatile, but not synchronized or native. These last two
modifiers are considered implementation detail and not part
of the API specification.</p>

<p>Rather than relying on the keyword synchronized, APIs
should document their concurrency semantics in the comment s
main description, as in &quot;a single Enumeration cannot be
used by multiple threads concurrently&quot;. The document
should not describe how to achieve these semantics. As
another example, while Hashtable should be thread-safe,
theres no rea- son to specify that we achieve this by
synchronizing all of its exported methods. We should reserve
the right to synchronize internally at the bucket level,
thus offering higher concurrency.</p>

<p>DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS The original &quot;Documentation
Comment Specification&quot; can be found under related
documentation.</p>

<p>Commenting the Source Code You can include documentation
comments (&quot;doc comments&quot;) in the source code,
ahead of declarations for any class, interface, method,
construc- tor, or field. You can also create doc comments
for each package and another one for the overview, though
their syntax is slightly differ- ent. Doc comments are also
known informally as &quot;Javadoc comments&quot; (but this
term violates its trademark usage). A doc comment consists
of the characters between the characters /** that begin the
comment and the characters */ that end it. Leading asterisks
are allowed on each line and are described further below.
The text in a comment can continue onto multiple lines.</p>

<p>/** * This is the typical format of a simple
documentation comment * that spans two lines. */</p>

<p>To save space you can put a comment on one line:</p>

<p>/** This comment takes up only one line. */</p>

<p>Placement of comments - Documentation comments are
recognized only when placed immediately before class,
interface, constructor, method, or field declarations -- see
the class example, method example, and field example.
Documentation comments placed in the body of a method are
ignored. Only one documentation comment per declaration
statement is recognized by the Javadoc tool.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to put an import statement between
the class com- ment and the class declaration. Avoid this,
as the Javadoc tool will ignore the class comment.</p>

<p>/** * This is the class comment for the class Whatever.
*/</p>

<p>import com.sun; // MISTAKE - Important not to put import
statement here</p>

<p>public class Whatever { }</p>

<p>A doc comment is composed of a main description followed
by a tag sec- tion - The main description begins after the
starting delimiter /** and continues until the tag section.
The tag section starts with the first block tag, which is
defined by the first @ character that begins a line
(ignoring leading asterisks, white space, and leading
separator /**). It is possible to have a comment with only a
tag section and no main description. The main description
cannot continue after the tag section begins. The argument
to a tag can span multiple lines. There can be any number of
tags -- some types of tags can be repeated while others can-
not. For example, this @see starts the tag section:</p>

<p>/** * This sentence would hold the main description for
this doc comment. * @see java.lang.Object */</p>

<p>Block tags and in-line tags - A tag is a special keyword
within a doc comment that the Javadoc tool can process.
There are two kinds of tags: block tags, which appear as
@tag (also known as &quot;standalone tags&quot;), and
in-line tags, which appear within curly braces, as {@tag}.
To be inter- preted, a block tag must appear at the
beginning of a line, ignoring leading asterisks, white
space, and separator (/**). This means you can use the @
character elsewhere in the text and it will not be inter-
preted as the start of a tag. If you want to start a line
with the @ character and not have it be interpreted, use the
HTML entity &amp;#064;. Each block tag has associated text,
which includes any text following the tag up to, but not
including, either the next tag, or the end of the doc
comment. This associated text can span multiple lines. An
in-line tag is allowed and interpreted anywhere that text is
allowed. The following example contains the block tag
@deprecated and in-line tag {@link}.</p>

<p>/** * @deprecated As of JDK 1.1, replaced by {@link
#setBounds(int,int,int,int)} */</p>

<p>Comments are written in HTML - The text must be written
in HTML, in that they should use HTML entities and can use
HTML tags. You can use whichever version of HTML your
browser supports; we have written the standard doclet to
generate HTML 3.2-compliant code elsewhere (outside of the
documentation comments) with the inclusion of cascading
style sheets and frames. (We preface each generated file
with &quot;HTML 4.0&quot; because of the frame sets.)</p>

<p>For example, entities for the less-than (&lt;) and
greater-than (&gt;) sym- bols should be written &lt; and
&gt;. Likewise, the ampersand (&amp;) should be written
&amp;. The bold HTML tag &lt;b&gt; is shown in the following
example.</p>

<p>Here is a doc comment:</p>

<p>/** * This is a &lt;b&gt;doc&lt;/b&gt; comment. * @see
java.lang.Object */</p>

<p>Leading asterisks - When javadoc parses a doc comment,
leading asterisk (*) characters on each line are discarded;
blanks and tabs preceding the initial asterisk (*)
characters are also discarded. Starting with 1.4, if you
omit the leading asterisk on a line, the leading white space
is no longer removed. This enables you to paste code
examples directly into a doc comment inside a &lt;PRE&gt;
tag, and its indentation will be honored. Spaces are
generally interpreted by browsers more uni- formly than
tabs. Indentation is relative to the left margin (rather
than the separator /** or &lt;PRE&gt; tag).</p>

<p>First sentence - The first sentence of each doc comment
should be a summary sentence, containing a concise but
complete description of the declared entity. This sentence
ends at the first period that is fol- lowed by a blank, tab,
or line terminator, or at the first block tag. The Javadoc
tool copies this first sentence to the member summary at the
top of the HTML page.</p>

<p>Declaration with multiple fields - Java allows declaring
multiple fields in a single statement, but this statement
can have only one doc- umentation comment, which is copied
for all fields. Therefore if you want individual
documentation comments for each field, you must declare each
field in a separate statement. For example, the following
documen- tation comment doesnt make sense written as a
single declaration and would be better handled as two
declarations:</p>

<p>/** * The horizontal and vertical distances of point
(x,y) */ public int x, y; // Avoid this</p>

<p>The Javadoc tool generates the following documentation
from the above code:</p>

<p>public int x The horizontal and vertical distances of
point (x,y)</p>

<p>public int y The horizontal and vertical distances of
point (x,y)</p>

<p>Use header tags carefully - When writing documentation
comments for members, it s best not to use HTML heading tags
such as &lt;H1&gt; and &lt;H2&gt;, because the Javadoc tool
creates an entire structured document and these structural
tags might interfere with the formatting of the gener- ated
document. However, it is fine to use these headings in class
and package comments to provide your own structure.</p>

<p>Automatic Copying of Method Comments The Javadoc tool
has the ability to copy or &quot;inherit&quot; method
comments in classes and interfaces under the following two
circumstances. Con- structors, fields and nested classes do
not inherit doc comments.</p>

<p>o Automatically inherit comment to fill in missing text
- When a main description, or @return, @param or @throws tag
is missing from a method comment, the Javadoc tool copies
the corresponding main description or tag comment from the
method it overrides or implements (if any), according to the
algorithm below.</p>

<p>More specifically, when a @param tag for a particular
parameter is missing, then the comment for that parameter is
copied from the method further up the inheritance hierarchy.
When a @throws tag for a particular exception is missing,
the @throws tag is copied only if that exception is
declared.</p>

<p>This behavior contrasts with version 1.3 and earlier,
where the presence of any main description or tag would
prevent all comments from being inherited.</p>

<p>o Explicitly inherit comment with {@inheritDoc} tag -
Insert the inline tag {@inheritDoc} in a method main
description or @return, @param or @throws tag comment -- the
corresponding inherited main description or tag comment is
copied into that spot.</p>

<p>The source file for the inherited method need only be on
the path spec- ified by -sourcepath for the doc comment to
actually be available to copy. Neither the class nor its
package needs to be passed in on the command line. This
contrasts with 1.3.x and earlier releases, where the class
had to be a documented class</p>

<p>Inherit from classes and interfaces - Inheriting of
comments occurs in all three possible cases of inheritance
from classes and interfaces:</p>

<p>o When a method in a class overrides a method in a
superclass</p>

<p>o When a method in an interface overrides a method in a
superinter- face</p>

<p>o When a method in a class implements a method in an
interface</p>

<p>In the first two cases, for method overrides, the
Javadoc tool gener- ates a subheading &quot;Overrides&quot;
in the documentation for the overriding method, with a link
to the method it is overriding, whether or not the comment
is inherited.</p>

<p>In the third case, when a method in a given class
implements a method in an interface, the Javadoc tool
generates a subheading &quot;Specified by&quot; in the
documentation for the overriding method, with a link to the
method it is implementing. This happens whether or not the
comment is inherited.</p>

<p>Algorithm for Inheriting Method Comments - If a method
does not have a doc comment, or has an {@inheritDoc} tag,
the Javadoc tool searches for an applicable comment using
the following algorithm, which is designed to find the most
specific applicable doc comment, giving preference to
interfaces over superclasses:</p>

<p>1. Look in each directly implemented (or extended)
interface in the order they appear following the word
implements (or extends) in the method declaration. Use the
first doc comment found for this method.</p>

<p>2. If step 1 failed to find a doc comment, recursively
apply this entire algorithm to each directly implemented (or
extended) interface, in the same order they were examined in
step 1.</p>

<p>3. If step 2 failed to find a doc comment and this is a
class other than Object (not an interface):</p>

<p>a. If the superclass has a doc comment for this method,
use it.</p>

<p>b. If step 3a failed to find a doc comment, recursively
apply this entire algorithm to the superclass.</p>

<p>JAVADOC TAGS The Javadoc tool parses special tags when
they are embedded within a Java doc comment. These doc tags
enable you to autogenerate a complete, well-formatted API
from your source code. The tags start with an &quot;at&quot;
sign (@) and are case-sensitive -- they must be typed with
the upper- case and lowercase letters as shown. A tag must
start at the beginning of a line (after any leading spaces
and an optional asterisk) or it is treated as normal text.
By convention, tags with the same name are grouped together.
For example, put all @see tags together.</p>

<p>Tags come in two types:</p>

<p>o Block tags - Can be placed only in the tag section
that follows the main description. Block tags are of the
form: @tag.</p>

<p>o Inline tags - Can be placed anywhere in the main
description or in the comments for block tags. Inline tags
are denoted by curly braces: {@tag}.</p>

<p>For information about tags we might introduce in future
releases, see Proposed Tags @
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/proposed-tags.html.</p>

<p>The current tags are:</p>

<p>For custom tags, see the -tag option.</p>

<p>@author name-text Adds an &quot;Author&quot; entry with
the specified name-text to the gener- ated docs when the
-author option is used. A doc comment may con- tain multiple
@author tags. You can specify one name per @author tag or
multiple names per tag. In the former case, the Javadoc tool
inserts a comma (,) and space between names. In the latter
case, the entire text is simply copied to the generated
document without being parsed. Therefore, you can use
multiple names per line if you want a localized name
separator other than comma.</p>

<p>For more details, see Where Tags Can Be Used and writing
@author tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#@author.</p>

<p>@deprecated deprecated-text Note: You can deprecate a
program ele- ment using the @Deprecated annotation.</p>

<p>Adds a comment indicating that this API should no longer
be used (even though it may continue to work). The Javadoc
tool moves the depre- cated-text ahead of the main
description, placing it in italics and preceding it with a
bold warning: &quot;Deprecated&quot;. This tag is valid in
all doc comments: overview, package, class, interface,
constructor, method and field.</p>

<p>The first sentence of deprecated-text should at least
tell the user when the API was deprecated and what to use as
a replacement. The Javadoc tool copies just the first
sentence to the summary section and index. Subsequent
sentences can also explain why it has been depre- cated. You
should include a {@link} tag (for Javadoc 1.2 or later) that
points to the replacement API:</p>

<p>For more details, see writing @deprecated tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#@deprecated.</p>

<p>o For Javadoc 1.2 and later, use a {@link} tag. This
creates the link in-line, where you want it. For
example:</p>

<p>/** * @deprecated As of JDK 1.1, replaced by {@link
#setBounds(int,int,int,int)} */</p>

<p>o For Javadoc 1.1, the standard format is to create a
@see tag (which cannot be in-line) for each @deprecated
tag.</p>

<p>For more about deprecation, see The @deprecated tag @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/depreca-
tion/index.html.</p>

<p>{@code text} Equivalent to
&lt;code&gt;{@literal}&lt;/code&gt;.</p>

<p>Displays text in code font without interpreting the text
as HTML markup or nested javadoc tags. This enables you to
use regular angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) instead of the
HTML entities (&lt; and &gt;) in doc comments, such as in
parameter types (&lt;Object&gt;), inequalities (3 &lt; 4),
or arrows (&lt;-). For example, the doc comment text:</p>

<p>{@code A&lt;B&gt;C}</p>

<p>displays in the generated HTML page unchanged, as:</p>

<p>A&lt;B&gt;C</p>

<p>The noteworthy point is that the &lt;B&gt; is not
interpreted as bold and is in code font.</p>

<p>If you want the same functionality without the code
font, use {@lit- eral}.</p>

<p>{@docRoot} Represents the relative path to the generated
documents (desti- nation) root directory from any generated
page. It is useful when you want to include a file, such as
a copyright page or company logo, that you want to reference
from all generated pages. Link- ing to the copyright page
from the bottom of each page is common.</p>

<p>This {@docRoot} tag can be used both on the command line
and in a doc comment: This tag is valid in all doc comments:
overview, pack- age, class, interface, constructor, method
and field, including the text portion of any tag (such as
@return, @param and @deprecated).</p>

<p>1. On the command line, where the header/footer/bottom
are defined:</p>

<p>javadoc -bottom &lt;a
href=&quot;{@docRoot}/copyright.html&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>NOTE - When using {@docRoot} this way in a make file,
some make- file programs require special escaping for the
brace {} charac- ters. For example, the Inprise MAKE version
5.2 running on Win- dows requires double braces:
{{@docRoot}}. It also requires dou- ble (rather than single)
quotes to enclose arguments to options such as -bottom (with
the quotes around the href argument omit- ted).</p>

<p>2. In a doc comment:</p>

<p>/** * See the &lt;a
href=&quot;{@docRoot}/copyright.html&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;.
*/</p>

<p>The reason this tag is needed is because the generated
docs are in hierarchical directories, as deep as the number
of subpackages. This expression:</p>

<p>&lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/copyright.html&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>would resolve to:</p>

<p>&lt;a href=&quot;../../copyright.html&quot;&gt; for
java/lang/Object.java</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&lt;a href=&quot;../../../copyright.html&quot;&gt; for
java/lang/ref/Reference.java</p>

<p>@exception class-name description The @exception tag is
a synonym for @throws.</p>

<p>{@inheritDoc} Inherits (copies) documentation from the
&quot;nearest&quot; inheritable class or implementable
interface into the current doc comment at this tag s
location. This allows you to write more general com- ments
higher up the inheritance tree, and to write around the
copied text.</p>

<p>This tag is valid only in these places in a doc
comment:</p>

<p>o In the main description block of a method. In this
case, the main description is copied from a class or
interface up the hierarchy.</p>

<p>o In the text arguments of the @return, @param and
@throws tags of a method. In this case, the tag text is
copied from the cor- responding tag up the hierarchy.</p>

<p>See Automatic Copying of Method Comments for a more
precise descrip- tion of how comments are found in the
inheritance hierarchy. Note that if this tag is missing, the
comment is or is not automatically inherited according to
rules described in that section.</p>

<p>{@link package.class#member label} Inserts an in-line
link with visible text label that points to the
documentation for the specified package, class or member
name of a referenced class. This tag is valid in all doc
comments: overview, package, class, interface, constructor,
method and field, including the text portion of any tag
(such as @return, @param and @deprecated).</p>

<p>This tag is very simliar to @see -- both require the
same references and accept exactly the same syntax for
package.class#member and label. The main difference is that
{@link} generates an in-line link rather than placing the
link in the &quot;See Also&quot; section. Also, the {@link}
tag begins and ends with curly braces to separate it from
the rest of the in-line text. If you need to use
&quot;}&quot; inside the label, use the HTML entity notation
&amp;#125;</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of {@link} tags allowed
in a sen- tence. You can use this tag in the main
description part of any doc- umentation comment or in the
text portion of any tag (such as @dep- recated, @return or
@param).</p>

<p>For example, here is a comment that refers to the
getComponen- tAt(int, int) method:</p>

<p>Use the {@link #getComponentAt(int, int) getComponentAt}
method.</p>

<p>From this, the standard doclet would generate the
following HTML (assuming it refers to another class in the
same package):</p>

<p>Use the &lt;a
href=&quot;Component.html#getComponentAt(int,
int)&quot;&gt;getComponentAt&lt;/a&gt; method.</p>

<p>Which appears on the web page as:</p>

<p>Use the getComponentAt method.</p>

<p>You can extend {@link} to link to classes not being
documented by using the -link option.</p>

<p>For more details, see writing {@link} tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#{@link}.</p>

<p>{@linkplain package.class#member label} Identical to
{@link}, except the links label is displayed in plain text
than code font. Useful when the label is plain text.
Example:</p>

<p>Refer to {@linkplain add() the overridden method}.</p>

<p>This would display as:</p>

<p>Refer to the overridden method.</p>

<p>{@literal text} Displays text without interpreting the
text as HTML markup or nested javadoc tags. This enables you
to use regular angle brack- ets (&lt; and &gt;) instead of
the HTML entities (&lt; and &gt;) in doc com- ments, such as
in parameter types (&lt;Object&gt;), inequalities (3 &lt;
4), or arrows (&lt;-). For example, the doc comment
text:</p>

<p>{@literal A&lt;B&gt;C}</p>

<p>displays unchanged in the generated HTML page in your
browser, as:</p>

<p>A&lt;B&gt;C</p>

<p>The noteworthy point is that the &lt;B&gt; is not
interpreted as bold (and it is not in code font).</p>

<p>If you want the same functionality but with the text in
code font, use {@code}.</p>

<p>@param parameter-name description Adds a parameter with
the specified parameter-name followed by the specified
description to the &quot;Parameters&quot; section. When
writ- ing the doc comment, you may continue the description
onto multi- ple lines. This tag is valid only in a doc
comment for a method, constructor or class.</p>

<p>The parameter-name can be the name of a parameter in a
method or constructor, or the name of a type parameter of a
class, method or constructor. Use angle brackets around this
parameter name to spec- ify the use of a type parameter.</p>

<p>Example of a type parameter of a class:</p>

<p>/** * @param &lt;E&gt; Type of element stored in a list
*/ public interface List&lt;E&gt; extends
Collection&lt;E&gt; { }</p>

<p>Example of a type parameter of a method:</p>

<p>/** * @param string the string to be converted * @param
type the type to convert the string to * @param &lt;T&gt;
the type of the element * @param &lt;V&gt; the value of the
element */ &lt;T, V extends T&gt; V convert(String string,
Class&lt;T&gt; type) { }</p>

<p>For more details, see writing @param tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#@param.</p>

<p>@return description Adds a &quot;Returns&quot; section
with the description text. This text should describe the
return type and permissible range of values. This tag is
valid only in a doc comment for a method.</p>

<p>For more details, see writing @return tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#@return.</p>

<p>@see reference Adds a &quot;See Also&quot; heading with
a link or text entry that points to reference. A doc comment
may contain any number of @see tags, which are all grouped
under the same heading. The @see tag has three variations;
the third form below is the most common. This tag is valid
in any doc comment: overview, package, class, inter- face,
constructor, method or field. For inserting an in-line link
within a sentence to a package, class or member, see
{@link}.</p>

<p>@see &quot;string&quot; Adds a text entry for string. No
link is generated. The string is a book or other reference
to information not available by URL. The Javadoc tool
distinguishes this from the previous cases by looking for a
double-quote (&quot;) as the first charac- ter. For
example:</p>

<p>@see &quot;The Java Programming Language&quot;</p>

<p>This generates text such as:</p>

<p>See Also: &quot;The Java Programming Language&quot;</p>

<p>@see &lt;a href=&quot;URL#value&quot;&gt;label&lt;/a&gt;
Adds a link as defined by URL#value. The URL#value is a
rela- tive or absolute URL. The Javadoc tool distinguishes
this from other cases by looking for a less-than symbol
(&lt;) as the first character. For example:</p>

<p>@see &lt;a href=&quot;spec.html#section&quot;&gt;Java
Spec&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>This generates a link such as:</p>

<p>See Also: Java Spec</p>

<p>@see package.class#member label Adds a link, with
visible text label, that points to the docu- mentation for
the specified name in the Java Language that is referenced.
The label is optional; if omitted, the name appears instead
as the visible text, suitably shortened -- see How a name is
displayed. Use -noqualifier to globally remove the package
name from this visible text. Use the label when you want the
visible text to be different from the auto-gener- ated
visible text.</p>

<p>Only in version 1.2, just the name but not the label
would auto- matically appear in &lt;code&gt; HTML tags,
Starting with 1.2.2, the &lt;code&gt; is always included
around the visible text, whether or not a label is used.</p>

<p>o package.class#member is any valid program element name
that is referenced -- a package, class, interface,
constructor, method or field name -- except that the
character ahead of the member name should be a hash
character (#). The class represents any top-level or nested
class or interface. The member represents any constructor,
method or field (not a nested class or interface). If this
name is in the docu- mented classes, the Javadoc tool will
automatically create a link to it. To create links to
external referenced classes, use the -link option. Use
either of the other two @see forms for referring to
documentation of a name that does not belong to a referenced
class. This argument is described at greater length below
under Specifying a Name.</p>

<p>o label is optional text that is visible as the links
label. The label can contain whitespace. If label is
omitted, then package.class.member will appear, suitably
shortened rela- tive to the current class and package -- see
How a name is displayed.</p>

<p>o A space is the delimiter between package.class#member
and label. A space inside parentheses does not indicate the
start of a label, so spaces may be used between parameters
in a method.</p>

<p>Example - In this example, an @see tag (in the Character
class) refers to the equals method in the String class. The
tag includes both arguments: the name
&quot;String#equals(Object)&quot; and the label
&quot;equals&quot;.</p>

<p>/** * @see String#equals(Object) equals */</p>

<p>The standard doclet produces HTML something like
this:</p>

<p>&lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;See Also:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a
href=&quot;../../java/lang/String#equals(java.lang.Object)&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equals&lt;code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</p>

<p>Which looks something like this in a browser, where the
label is the visible link text:</p>

<p>See Also: equals</p>

<p>Specifying a name - This package.class#member name can
be either fully-qualified, such as
java.lang.String#toUpperCase() or not, such as
String#toUpperCase() or #toUpperCase(). If less than
fully-qualified, the Javadoc tool uses the normal Java
compiler search order to find it, further described below in
Search order for @see. The name can contain whitespace
within parentheses, such as between method arguments.</p>

<p>Of course the advantage of providing shorter,
&quot;partially-quali- fied&quot; names is that they are
shorter to type and there is less clutter in the source
code. The following table shows the differ- ent forms of the
name, where Class can be a class or interface, Type can be a
class, interface, array, or primitive, and method can be a
method or constructor.</p>

<p>The following notes apply to the above table:</p>

<p>o The first set of forms (with no class or package) will
cause the Javadoc tool to search only through the current
classs hierarchy. It will find a member of the current class
or interface, one of its superclasses or superinterfaces, or
one of its enclosing classes or interfaces (search steps
1-3). It will not search the rest of the current package or
other packages (search steps 4-5).</p>

<p>o If any method or constructor is entered as a name with
no parentheses, such as getValue, and if there is no field
with the same name, the Javadoc tool will correctly create a
link to it, but will print a warning message reminding you
to add the parentheses and arguments. If this method is
overloaded, the Javadoc tool will link to the first method
its search encounters, which is unspecified.</p>

<p>o Nested classes must be specified as outer.inner, not
simply inner, for all forms.</p>

<p>o As stated, the hash character (#), rather than a dot
(.) separates a member from its class. This enables the
Javadoc tool to resolve ambiguities, since the dot also
separates classes, nested classes, packages, and
subpackages. However, the Javadoc tool is generally lenient
and will properly parse a dot if you know there is no
ambiguity, though it will print a warning.</p>

<p>Search order for @see - the Javadoc tool will process a
@see tag that appears in a source file (.java), package file
(package.html or package-info.java) or overview file
(overview.html). In the latter two files, you must
fully-qualify the name you supply with @see. In a source
file, you can specify a name that is fully-qualified or
partially-qualified.</p>

<p>When the Javadoc tool encounters a @see tag in a .java
file that is not fully qualified, it searches for the
specified name in the same order as the Java compiler would
(except the Javadoc tool will not detect certain namespace
ambiguities, since it assumes the source code is free of
these errors). This search order is formally defined in the
Java Language Specification. The Javadoc tool searches for
that name through all related and imported classes and
packages. In particular, it searches in this order:</p>

<p>1. the current class or interface</p>

<p>2. any enclosing classes and interfaces, searching
closest first</p>

<p>3. any superclasses and superinterfaces, searching
closest first</p>

<p>4. the current package</p>

<p>5. any imported packages, classes and interfaces,
searching in the order of the import statement</p>

<p>The Javadoc tool continues to search recursively through
steps 1-3 for each class it encounters until it finds a
match. That is, after it searches through the current class
and its enclosing class E, it will search through E s
superclasses before Es enclosing classes. In steps 4 and 5,
the Javadoc tool does not search classes or interfaces
within a package in any specified order (that order depends
on the particular compiler). In step 5, the Javadoc tool
looks in java.lang, since that is automatically imported by
all programs.</p>

<p>The Javadoc tool does not necessarily look in
subclasses, nor will it look in other packages even if their
documentation is being generated in the same run. For
example, if the @see tag is in the java.awt.event.KeyEvent
class and refers to a name in the java.awt package, javadoc
does not look in that package unless that class imports
it.</p>

<p>How a name is displayed - If label is omitted, then
pack- age.class.member appears. In general, it is suitably
shortened relative to the current class and package. By
&quot;shortened&quot;, we mean the Javadoc tool displays
only the minimum name necessary. For example, if the
String.toUpperCase() method contains refer- ences to a
member of the same class and to a member of a differ- ent
class, the class name is displayed only in the latter case,
as shown in the following table.</p>

<p>Use -noqualifier to globally remove the package
names.</p>

<p>Examples of @see The comment to the right shows how the
name would be displayed if the @see tag is in a class in
another package, such as java.applet.Applet.</p>

<p>@serial field-description | include | exclude Used in
the doc comment for a default serializable field.</p>

<p>An optional field-description should explain the meaning
of the field and list the acceptable values. If needed, the
description can span multiple lines. The standard doclet
adds this information to the serialized form page.</p>

<p>If a serializable field was added to a class some time
after the class was made serializable, a statement should be
added to its main description to identify at which version
it was added.</p>

<p>The include and exclude arguments identify whether a
class or pack- age should be included or excluded from the
serialized form page. They work as follows:</p>

<p>o A public or protected class that implements
Serializable is included unless that class (or its package)
is marked @serial exclude.</p>

<p>o A private or package-private class that implements
Serializable is excluded unless that class (or its package)
is marked @serial include.</p>

<p>Examples: The javax.swing package is marked @serial
exclude (in package.html or package-info.java). The public
class java.secu- rity.BasicPermission is marked @serial
exclude. The package-private class
java.util.PropertyPermissionCollection is marked @serial
include.</p>

<p>The tag @serial at a class level overrides @serial at a
package level.</p>

<p>For more information about how to use these tags, along
with an example, see &quot; Documenting Serializable Fields
and Data for a Class @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/serializa-
tion/spec/serial-arch.html,&quot; Section 1.6 of the Java
Object Serial- ization Specification. Also see the
Serialization FAQ @
http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/basic/serialization-
FAQ.jsp#javadoc_warn_missing, which covers common questions,
such as &quot;Why do I see javadoc warnings stating that I
am missing @serial tags for private fields if I am not
running javadoc with the -pri- vate switch?&quot;. Also see
Suns criteria @
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingapispecs/serialized-crite-
ria.html for including classes in the serialized form
specification.</p>

<p>@serialField field-name field-type field-description
Documents an ObjectStreamField component of a Serializable
class s serialPersistentFields member. One @serialField tag
should be used for each ObjectStreamField component.</p>

<p>@serialData data-description The data-description
documents the types and order of data in the serialized
form. Specifically, this data includes the optional data
written by the writeObject method and all data (including
base classes) written by the Externalizable.writeExternal
method.</p>

<p>The @serialData tag can be used in the doc comment for
the writeOb- ject, readObject, writeExternal, readExternal,
writeReplace, and readResolve methods.</p>

<p>@since since-text Adds a &quot;Since&quot; heading with
the specified since-text to the gen- erated documentation.
The text has no special internal structure. This tag is
valid in any doc comment: overview, package, class,
interface, constructor, method or field. This tag means that
this change or feature has existed since the software
release speci- fied by the since-text. For example:</p>

<p>@since 1.5</p>

<p>For source code in the Java platform, this tag indicates
the version of the Java platform API specification (not
necessarily when it was added to the reference
implementation). Multiple @since tags are allowed and are
treated like multiple @author tags. You could use multiple
tags if the prgram element is used by more than one API.</p>

<p>@throws class-name description The @throws and
@exception tags are synonyms. Adds a &quot;Throws&quot;
subheading to the generated documentation, with the
class-name and description text. The class-name is the name
of the exception that may be thrown by the method. This tag
is valid only in the doc comment for a method or
constructor. If this class is not fully-specified, the
Javadoc tool uses the search order to look up this class.
Multiple @throws tags can be used in a given doc comment for
the same or different exceptions.</p>

<p>To ensure that all checked exceptions are documented, if
a @throws tag does not exist for an exception in the throws
clause, the Javadoc tool automatically adds that exception
to the HTML output (with no description) as if it were
documented with @throws tag.</p>

<p>The @throws documentation is copied from an overridden
method to a subclass only when the exception is explicitly
declared in the over- ridden method. The same is true for
copying from an interface method to an implementing method.
You can use {@inheritDoc} to force @throws to inherit
documentation.</p>

<p>For more details, see writing @throws tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#@exception.</p>

<p>{@value package.class#field} When {@value} is used
(without any argument) in the doc comment of a static field,
it displays the value of that constant:</p>

<p>/** * The value of this constant is {@value}. */ public
static final String SCRIPT_START =
&quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>When used with argument package.class#field in any doc
comment, it displays the value of the specified
constant:</p>

<p>/** * Evaluates the script starting with {@value
#SCRIPT_START}. */ public String evalScript(String script) {
}</p>

<p>The argument package.class#field takes a form identical
to that of the @see argument, except that the member must be
a static field.</p>

<p>These values of these constants are also displayed on
the Constant Field Values @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/constant-values.html
page.</p>

<p>@version version-text Adds a &quot;Version&quot;
subheading with the specified version-text to the generated
docs when the -version option is used. This tag is intended
to hold the current version number of the software that this
code is part of (as opposed to @since, which holds the ver-
sion number where this code was introduced). The
version-text has no special internal structure. To see where
the version tag can be used, see Where Tags Can Be Used.</p>

<p>A doc comment may contain multiple @version tags. If it
makes sense, you can specify one version number per @version
tag or multiple ver- sion numbers per tag. In the former
case, the Javadoc tool inserts a comma (,) and space between
names. In the latter case, the entire text is simply copied
to the generated document without being parsed. Therefore,
you can use multiple names per line if you want a localized
name separator other than comma.</p>

<p>For more details, see writing @version tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#@version.</p>

<p>Where Tags Can Be Used The following sections describe
where the tags can be used. Note that these tags can be used
in all doc comments: @see, @since, @deprecated, {@link},
{@linkplain}, and {@docroot}.</p>

<p>Overview Documentation Tags Overview tags are tags that
can appear in the documentation comment for the overview
page (which resides in the source file typically named
overview.html). Like in any other documentation comments,
these tags must appear after the main description.</p>

<p>NOTE - The {@link} tag has a bug in overview documents
in version 1.2 -- the text appears properly but has no link.
The {@docRoot} tag does not currently work in overview
documents.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The javadoc tool uses doclets to determine its
output. The Javadoc tool uses the default standard doclet
unless a custom doclet is specified with the -doclet option.
The Javadoc tool provides a set of com- mand-line options
that can be used with any doclet -- these options are
described below under the sub-heading Javadoc Options. The
standard doclet provides an additional set of command-line
options that are described below under the sub-heading
Options Provided by the Standard Doclet. All option names
are case-insensitive, though their arguments can be
case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The options are:</p>

<p>Options shown in italic are the Javadoc core options,
which are pro- vided by the front end of the Javadoc tool
and are available to all doclets. The standard doclet itself
provides the non-italic options.</p>

<p>Javadoc Options -overview path/filename Specifies that
javadoc should retrieve the text for the overview
documentation from the &quot;source&quot; file specified by
path/filename and place it on the Overview page
(overview-summary.html). The path/filename is relative to
the current directory. While you can use any name you want
for filename and place it anywhere you want for path, a
typical thing to do is to name it overview.html and place it
in the source tree at the directory that contains the
topmost package directories. In this location, no path is
needed when documenting packages, since -sourcepath will
point to this file. For example, if the source tree for the
java.lang package is /src/classes/java/lang/, then you could
place the overview file at /src/classes/overview.html. See
Real World Example. For information about the file specified
by path/filename, see overview comment file. Note that the
overview page is created only if you pass into javadoc two
or more package names. For further explanation, see HTML
Frames.) The title on the overview page is set by
-doctitle.</p>

<p>-public Shows only public classes and members.</p>

<p>-protected Shows only protected and public classes and
members. This is the default.</p>

<p>-package Shows only package, protected, and public
classes and members.</p>

<p>-private Shows all classes and members.</p>

<p>-help Displays the online help, which lists these
javadoc and doclet command line options.</p>

<p>-doclet class Specifies the class file that starts the
doclet used in generat- ing the documentation. Use the
fully-qualified name. This doclet defines the content and
formats the output. If the -doclet option is not used,
javadoc uses the standard doclet for generating the default
HTML format. This class must contain the start(Root) method.
The path to this starting class is defined by the
-docletpath option. For example, to call the MIF doclet,
use:</p>

<p>-doclet com.sun.tools.doclets.mif.MIFDoclet</p>

<p>For full, working examples of running a particular
doclet, see the MIF Doclet documentation @
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/mifdoclet/docs/mifdoclet.html.</p>

<p>-docletpath classpathlist Specifies the path to the
doclet starting class file (specified with the -doclet
option) and any jar files it depends on. If the starting
class file is in a jar file, then this specifies the path to
that jar file, as shown in the example below. You can
specify an absolute path or a path relative to the current
direc- tory. If classpathlist contains multiple paths or jar
files, they should be separated with a colon (:) on Solaris
and a semi-colon (;) on Windows. This option is not
necessary if the doclet start- ing class is already in the
search path. Example of path to jar file that contains the
starting doclet class file. Notice the jar filename is
included.</p>

<p>-docletpath /home/user/mifdoclet/lib/mifdoclet.jar</p>

<p>Example of path to starting doclet class file. Notice
the class filename is omitted.</p>

<p>-docletpath
/home/user/mifdoclet/classes/com/sun/tools/doclets/mif/</p>

<p>For full, working examples of running a particular
doclet, see the MIF Doclet documentation @
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/mifdoclet/docs/mifdoclet.html.</p>

<p>-1.1 This feature has been removed from Javadoc 1.4.
There is no replacement for it. This option created
documentation with the appearance and functionality of
documentation generated by Javadoc 1.1 (it never supported
nested classes). If you need this option, use Javadoc 1.2 or
1.3 instead.</p>

<p>-source release Specifies the version of source code
accepted. The following val- ues for release are
allowed:</p>

<p>o 1.5 - javadoc accepts code containing generics and
other lan- guage features introduced in JDK 1.5. The
compiler defaults to the 1.5 behavior if the -source flag is
not used.</p>

<p>o 1.4 - javadoc accepts code containing assertions,
which were introduced in JDK 1.4.</p>

<p>o 1.3 - javadoc does not support assertions, generics,
or other language features introduced after JDK 1.3. Use the
value of release corresponding to that used when compiling
the code with javac.</p>

<p>-sourcepath sourcepathlist Specifies the search paths
for finding source files (.java) when passing package names
or -subpackages into the javadoc command. The sourcepathlist
can contain multiple paths by separating them with a colon
(:). The Javadoc tool will search in all subdirecto- ries of
the specified paths. Note that this option is not only used
to locate the source files being documented, but also to
find source files that are not being documented but whose
com- ments are inherited by the source files being
documented. Note that you can use the -sourcepath option
only when passing package names into the javadoc command --
it will not locate .java files passed into the javadoc
command. (To locate .java files, cd to that directory or
include the path ahead of each file, as shown at Documenting
One or More Classes.) If -sour- cepath is omitted, javadoc
uses the class path to find the source files (see
-classpath). Therefore, the default -sourcepath is the value
of class path. If -classpath is omitted and you are passing
package names into javadoc, it looks in the current
directory (and subdirectories) for the source files. Set
sourcepathlist to the root directory of the source tree for
the package you are documenting. For example, suppose you
want to document a package called com.mypackage whose source
files are located at:</p>

<p>/home/user/src/com/mypackage/*.java</p>

<p>In this case you would specify the sourcepath to
/home/user/src, the directory that contains com/mypackage,
and then supply the package name com.mypackage:</p>

<p>% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src/ com.mypackage This
is easy to remember by noticing that if you concatenate the
value of sourcepath and the package name together and change
the dot to a slash &quot;/&quot;, you end up with the full
path to the package: /home/user/src/com/mypackage. To point
to two source paths:</p>

<p>% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user1/src:/home/user2/src
com.mypackage</p>

<p>-classpath classpathlist Specifies the paths where
javadoc will look for referenced classes (.class files) --
these are the documented classes plus any classes referenced
by those classes. The classpathlist can contain multiple
paths by separating them with a colon (:). The Javadoc tool
will search in all subdirectories of the specified paths.
Follow the instructions in class path @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/tools/index.html#general documentation for specifying
classpathlist. If -sourcepath is omitted, the Javadoc tool
uses -classpath to find the source files as well as class
files (for backward com- patibility). Therefore, if you want
to search for source and class files in separate paths, use
both -sourcepath and -class- path. For example, if you want
to document com.mypackage, whose source files reside in the
directory /home/user/src/com/mypackage, and if this package
relies on a library in /home/user/lib, you would
specify:</p>

<p>% javadoc -classpath /home/user/lib -sourcepath
/home/user/src com.mypackage As with other tools, if you do
not specify -classpath, the Javadoc tool uses the CLASSPATH
environment variable, if it is set. If both are not set, the
Javadoc tool searches for classes from the current
directory. For an in-depth description of how the Javadoc
tool uses -class- path to find user classes as it relates to
extension classes and bootstrap classes, see How Classes Are
Found @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/finding-
classes.html. As a special convenience, a class path element
containing a base- name of * is considered equivalent to
specifying a list of all the files in the directory with the
extension .jar or .JAR (a Java program cannot tell the
difference between the two invoca- tions). For example, if
directory foo contains a.jar and b.JAR, then the class path
element foo/* is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR, except that the
order of jar files is unspecified. All jar files in the
specified directory, even hidden ones, are included in the
list. A classpath entry consisting simply of * expands to a
list of all the jar files in the current directory. The
CLASSPATH environment variable, where defined, will be
similarly expanded. Any class- path wildcard expansion
occurs before the Java virtual machine is started -- no Java
program will ever see unexpanded wildcards except by
querying the environment. For example; by invoking Sys-
tem.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).</p>

<p>-subpackages package1:package2:... Generates
documentation from source files in the specified pack- ages
and recursively in their subpackages. This option is useful
when adding new subpackages to the source code, as they are
auto- matically included. Each package argument is any
top-level sub- package (such as java) or fully qualified
package (such as javax.swing) that does not need to contain
source files. Argu- ments are separated by colons (on all
operating systmes). Wild- cards are not needed or allowed.
Use -sourcepath to specify where to find the packages. This
option is smart about not processing source files that are
in the source tree but do not belong to the packages, as
described at processing of source files. For example:</p>

<p>% javadoc -d docs -sourcepath /home/user/src
-subpackages java:javax.swing This command generates
documentation for packages named &quot;java&quot; and
&quot;javax.swing&quot; and all their subpackages. You can
use -subpackages in conjunction with -exclude to exclude
specific packages.</p>

<p>-exclude packagename1:packagename2:... Unconditionally
excludes the specified packages and their sub- packages from
the list formed by -subpackages. It excludes those packages
even if they would otherwise be included by some previ- ous
or later -subpackages option. For example:</p>

<p>% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src -subpackages java
-exclude java.net:java.lang would include java.io,
java.util, and java.math (among others), but would exclude
packages rooted at java.net and java.lang. Notice this
excludes java.lang.ref, a subpackage of java.lang).</p>

<p>-bootclasspath classpathlist Specifies the paths where
the boot classes reside. These are nom- inally the Java
platform classes. The bootclasspath is part of the search
path the Javadoc tool will use to look up source and class
files. See How Classes Are Found @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/finding-
classes.html#srcfiles. for more details. Separate
directories in classpathlist with colons (:).</p>

<p>-extdirs dirlist Specifies the directories where
extension classes reside. These are any classes that use the
Java Extension mechanism. The extdirs is part of the search
path the Javadoc tool will use to look up source and class
files. See -classpath (above) for more details. Separate
directories in dirlist with colons (:).</p>

<p>-verbose Provides more detailed messages while javadoc
is running. Without the verbose option, messages appear for
loading the source files, generating the documentation (one
message per source file), and sorting. The verbose option
causes the printing of additional messages specifying the
number of milliseconds to parse each java source file.</p>

<p>-quiet Shuts off non-error and non-warning messages,
leaving only the warnings and errors appear, making them
easier to view. Also sup- presses the version string.</p>

<p>-breakiterator Uses the internationalized sentence
boundary of java.text.BreakIterator @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/BreakItera-
tor.html to determine the end of the first sentence for
English (all other locales already use BreakIterator),
rather than an English language, locale-specific algorithm.
By first sentence, we mean the first sentence in the main
description of a package, class or member. This sentence is
copied to the package, class or member summary, and to the
alphabetic index. From JDK 1.2 forward, the BreakIterator
class is already used to determine the end of sentence for
all languages but English. Therefore, the -breakiterator
option has no effect except for English from 1.2 forward.
English has its own default algorithm:</p>

<p>o English default sentence-break algorithm - Stops at a
period followed by a space or a HTML block tag, such as
&lt;P&gt;.</p>

<p>o Breakiterator sentence-break algorithm - In general,
stops at a period, question mark or exclamation mark
followed by a space if the next word starts with a capital
letter. This is meant to handle most abbreviations (such as
&quot;The serial no. is valid&quot;, but wont handle
&quot;Mr. Smith&quot;). Doesnt stop at HTML tags or
sentences that begin with numbers or symbols. Stops at the
last period in &quot;../filename&quot;, even if embedded in
an HTML tag. NOTE: We have removed from 1.5.0 the
breakiterator warning messages that were in 1.4.x and have
left the default sentence-break algo- rithm unchanged. That
is, the -breakiterator option is not the default in 1.5.0,
nor do we expect it to become the default. This is a
reversal from our former intention that the default would
change in the &quot;next major release&quot; (1.5.0). This
means if you have not mod- ified your source code to
eliminate the breakiterator warnings in 1.4.x, then you don
t have to do anything, and the warnings go away starting
with 1.5.0. The reason for this reversal is because any
benefit to having breakiterator become the default would be
out- weighed by the incompatible source change it would
require. We regret any extra work and confusion this has
caused.</p>

<p>-locale language_country_variant Important - The -locale
option must be placed ahead (to the left) of any options
provided by the standard doclet or any other doclet.
Otherwise, the navigation bars will appear in English. This
is the only command-line option that is order-dependent.
Specifies the locale that javadoc uses when generating
documenta- tion. The argument is the name of the locale, as
described in java.util.Locale documentation, such as en_US
(English, United States) or en_US_WIN (Windows variant).
Specifying a locale causes javadoc to choose the resource
files of that locale for messages (strings in the navigation
bar, head- ings for lists and tables, help file contents,
comments in stylesheet.css, and so forth). It also specifies
the sorting order for lists sorted alphabetically, and the
sentence separator to determine the end of the first
sentence. It does not determine the locale of the doc
comment text specified in the source files of the documented
classes.</p>

<p>-encoding name Specifies the encoding name of the source
files, such as EUCJIS/SJIS. If this option is not specified,
the platform default converter is used. Also see
-docencoding and -charset.</p>

<p>-Jflag Passes flag directly to the runtime system java
that runs javadoc. Notice there must be no space between the
J and the flag. For example, if you need to ensure that the
system sets aside 32 megabytes of memory in which to process
the generated documentation, then you would call the -Xmx
option of java as follows (-Xms is optional, as it only sets
the size of initial memory, which is useful if you know the
minimum amount of memory required):</p>

<p>% javadoc -J-Xmx32m -J-Xms32m com.mypackage To tell what
version of javadoc you are using, call the &quot;-ver-
sion&quot; option of java:</p>

<p>% javadoc -J-version java version &quot;1.2&quot;
Classic VM (build JDK-1.2-V, green threads, sunwjit) (The
version number of the standard doclet appears in its output
stream.)</p>

<p>Options Provided by the Standard Doclet -d directory
Specifies the destination directory where javadoc saves the
gen- erated HTML files. (The &quot;d&quot; means
&quot;destination.&quot;) Omitting this option causes the
files to be saved to the current directory. The value
directory can be absolute, or relative to the current work-
ing directory. As of 1.4, the destination directory is
automati- cally created when javadoc is run. For example,
the following generates the documentation for the package
com.mypackage and saves the results in the /home/user/doc/
directory:</p>

<p>% javadoc -d /home/user/doc com.mypackage</p>

<p>-use Includes one &quot;Use&quot; page for each
documented class and package. The page describes what
packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields use any
API of the given class or package. Given class C, things
that use class C would include subclasses of C, fields
declared as C, methods that return C, and methods and
construc- tors with parameters of type C. For example, let
us look at what might appear on the &quot;Use&quot; page for
String. The getName() method in the java.awt.Font class
returns type String. Therefore, getName() uses String, and
you will find that method on the &quot;Use&quot; page for
String. Note that this documents only uses of the API, not
the implemen- tation. If a method uses String in its
implementation but does not take a string as an argument or
return a string, that is not considered a &quot;use&quot; of
String. You can access the generated &quot;Use&quot; page by
first going to the class or package, then clicking on the
&quot;Use&quot; link in the naviga- tion bar.</p>

<p>-version Includes the @version text in the generated
docs. This text is omitted by default. To tell what version
of the Javadoc tool you are using, use the -J-version
option.</p>

<p>-author Includes the @author text in the generated
docs.</p>

<p>-splitindex Splits the index file into multiple files,
alphabetically, one file per letter, plus a file for any
index entries that start with non-alphabetical
characters.</p>

<p>-windowtitle title Specifies the title to be placed in
the HTML &lt;title&gt; tag. This appears in the window title
and in any browser bookmarks (favorite places) that someone
creates for this page. This title should not contain any
HTML tags, as the browser will not prop- erly interpret
them. Any internal quotation marks within title may have to
be escaped. If -windowtitle is omitted, the Javadoc tool
uses the value of -doctitle for this option.</p>

<p>% javadoc -windowtitle &quot;Java SE Platform&quot;
com.mypackage</p>

<p>-doctitle title Specifies the title to be placed near
the top of the overview summary file. The title will be
placed as a centered, level-one heading directly beneath the
upper navigation bar. The title may contain html tags and
white space, though if it does, it must be enclosed in
quotes. Any internal quotation marks within title may have
to be escaped.</p>

<p>% javadoc -doctitle &quot;Java(TM)&quot;
com.mypackage</p>

<p>-title title This option no longer exists. It existed
only in Beta versions of Javadoc 1.2. It has been renamed to
-doctitle. This option is being renamed to make it clear
that it defines the document title rather than the window
title.</p>

<p>-header header Specifies the header text to be placed at
the top of each output file. The header will be placed to
the right of the upper naviga- tion bar. header may contain
HTML tags and white space, though if it does, it must be
enclosed in quotes. Any internal quotation marks within
header may have to be escaped.</p>

<p>% javadoc -header &quot;&lt;b&gt;Java 2 Platform
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;v1.4&quot; com.mypackage</p>

<p>-footer footer Specifies the footer text to be placed at
the bottom of each out- put file. The footer will be placed
to the right of the lower navigation bar. footer may contain
html tags and white space, though if it does, it must be
enclosed in quotes. Any internal quotation marks within
footer may have to be escaped.</p>

<p>-top Specifies the text to be placed at the top of each
output file.</p>

<p>-bottom text Specifies the text to be placed at the
bottom of each output file. The text will be placed at the
bottom of the page, below the lower navigation bar. The text
may contain HTML tags and white space, though if it does, it
must be enclosed in quotes. Any internal quotation marks
within text may have to be escaped.</p>

<p>-link extdocURL Creates links to existing
javadoc-generated documentation of external referenced
classes. It takes one argument:</p>

<p>o extdocURL is the absolute or relative URL of the
directory con- taining the external javadoc-generated
documentation you want to link to. Examples are shown below.
The package-list file must be found in this directory
(otherwise, use -linkoffline). The Javadoc tool reads the
package names from the package-list file and then links to
those packages at that URL. When the Javadoc tool is run,
the extdocURL value is copied literally into the &lt;A
HREF&gt; links that are created. Therefore, extdocURL must
be the URL to the directory, not to a file. You can use an
absolute link for extdocURL to enable your docs to link to a
document on any website, or can use a relative link to link
only to a relative location. If relative, the value you pass
in should be the relative path from the destination
directory (specified with -d) to the directory con- taining
the packages being linked to. When specifying an absolute
link you normally use an http: link. However, if you want to
link to a file system that has no web server, you can use a
file: link -- however, do this only if everyone wanting to
access the generated documentation shares the same file
system. In all cases, and on all operating systems, you
should use a forward slash as the separator, whether the URL
is absolute or relative, and &quot;http:&quot; or
&quot;file:&quot; based (as specified in the URL Memo @
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).</p>

<p>Absolute http: based link: -link
http://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/.../&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>Absolute file: based link: -link
file://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/.../&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>Relative link: -link
&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/.../&lt;name&gt; You can
specify multiple -link options in a given javadoc run to
link to multiple documents. Choosing between -linkoffline
and -link: Use -link:</p>

<p>o when using a relative path to the external API
document, or</p>

<p>o when using an absolute URL to the external API
document, if your shell allows a program to open a
connection to that URL for reading. Use -linkoffline:</p>

<p>o when using an absolute URL to the external API
document, if your shell does not allow a program to open a
connection to that URL for reading. This can occur if you
are behind a fire- wall and the document you want to link to
is on the other side. Example using absolute links to the
external docs - Let us say you want to link to the
java.lang, java.io and other Java Platform pack- ages at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/ @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/. The following
command generates documentation for the package
com.mypackage with links to the Java SE Platform packages.
The generated documentation will con- tain links to the
Object class, for example, in the class trees. (Other
options, such as -sourcepath and -d, are not shown.)</p>

<p>% javadoc -link
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/ com.mypackage
Example using relative links to the external docs - Let us
say you have two packages whose docs are generated in
different runs of the Javadoc tool, and those docs are
separated by a relative path. In this example, the packages
are com.apipackage, an API, and com.spi- package, an SPI
(Service Provide Interface). You want the documenta- tion to
reside in docs/api/com/apipackage and docs/spi/com/spipack-
age. Assuming the API package documentation is already
generated, and that docs is the current directory, you would
document the SPI package with links to the API documentation
by running:</p>

<p>% javadoc -d ./spi -link ../api com.spipackage Notice
the -link argument is relative to the destination directory
(docs/spi). Details - The -link option enables you to link
to classes referenced to by your code but not documented in
the current javadoc run. For these links to go to valid
pages, you must know where those HTML pages are located, and
specify that location with extdocURL. This allows, for
instance, third party documentation to link to java.*
documentation on http://java.sun.com. Omit the -link option
for javadoc to create links only to API within the
documentation it is generating in the current run. (Without
the -link option, the Javadoc tool does not create links to
documenta- tion for external references, because it does not
know if or where that documentation exists.) This option can
create links in several places in the generated doc-
umentation. Another use is for cross-links between sets of
packages: Execute javadoc on one set of packages, then run
javadoc again on another set of packages, creating links
both ways between both sets. How a Class Must be Referenced
- For a link to an external refer- enced class to actually
appear (and not just its text label), the class must be
referenced in the following way. It is not sufficient for it
to be referenced in the body of a method. It must be refer-
enced in either an import statement or in a declaration.
Here are examples of how the class java.io.File can be
referenced:</p>

<p>o In any kind of import statement: by wildcard import,
import explicitly by name, or automatically import for
java.lang.*. For example, this would suffice: import
java.io.*; In 1.3.x and 1.2.x, only an explicit import by
name works -- a wildcard import statement does not work, nor
does the automatic import java.lang.*.</p>

<p>o In a declaration: void foo(File f) {} The reference
and be in the return type or parameter type of a method,
constructor, field, class or interface, or in an imple-
ments, extends or throws statement. An important corollary
is that when you use the -link option, there may be many
links that unintentionally do not appear due to this
constraint. (The text would appear without a hypertext
link.) You can detect these by the warnings they emit. The
most innocuous way to properly reference a class and thereby
add the link would be to import that class, as shown above.
Package List - The -link option requires that a file named
pack- age-list, which is generated by the Javadoc tool,
exist at the URL you specify with -link. The package-list
file is a simple text file that lists the names of packages
documented at that location. In the earlier example, the
Javadoc tool looks for a file named pack- age-list at the
given URL, reads in the package names and then links to
those packages at that URL. For example, the package list
for the Java SE 6 API is located at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/package-list @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/package-list. and
starts as follows:</p>

<p>java.applet java.awt java.awt.color
java.awt.datatransfer java.awt.dnd java.awt.event
java.awt.font etc.</p>

<p>When javadoc is run without the -link option, when it
encounters a name that belongs to an external referenced
class, it prints the name with no link. However, when the
-link option is used, the Javadoc tool searches the
package-list file at the specified extdocURL location for
that package name. If it finds the package name, it prefixes
the name with extdocURL. In order for there to be no broken
links, all of the documentation for the external references
must exist at the specified URLs. The Javadoc tool will not
check that these pages exist -- only that the package-list
exists. Multiple Links - You can supply multiple -link
options to link to any number of external generated
documents. Javadoc 1.2 has a known bug which prevents you
from supplying more than one -link com- mand. This was fixed
in 1.2.2. Specify a different link option for each external
document to link to: % javadoc -link extdocURL1 -link
extdocURL2 ... -link extdocURLn com.mypackage where
extdocURL1, extdocURL2, ... extdocURLn point respectively to
the roots of external documents, each of which contains a
file named package-list. Cross-links - Note that
&quot;bootstrapping&quot; may be required when cross-linking
two or more documents that have not previously been
generated. In other words, if package-list does not exist
for either document, when you run the Javadoc tool on the
first document, the package-list will not yet exist for the
second document. Therefore, to create the external links,
you must re-generate the first document after generating the
second document. In this case, the purpose of first
generating a document is to cre- ate its package-list (or
you can create it by hand it if youre cer- tain of the
package names). Then generate the second document with its
external links. The Javadoc tool prints a warning if a
needed external package-list file does not exist.</p>

<p>-linkoffline extdocURL packagelistLoc This option is a
variation of -link; they both create links to
javadoc-generated documentation for external referenced
classes. Use the -linkoffline option when linking to a
document on the web when the Javadoc tool itself is
&quot;offline&quot; -- that is, it cannot access the
document through a web connection. More specifically, use
-linkoffline if the external documents package-list file is
not accessible or does not exist at the extdocURL location
but does exist at a different location, which can be
specified by packageListLoc (typically local). Thus, if
extdocURL is accessible only on the World Wide Web,
-linkoffline removes the constraint that the Javadoc tool
have a web connec- tion when generating the documentation.
Another use is as a &quot;hack&quot; to update docs: After
you have run javadoc on a full set of packages, then you can
run javadoc again on onlya smaller set of changed packages,
so that the updated files can be inserted back into the
original set. Examples are given below. The -linkoffline
option takes two arguments -- the first for the string to be
embedded in the &lt;a href&gt; links, the second telling it
where to find package-list:</p>

<p>o extdocURL is the absolute or relative URL of the
directory con- taining the external javadoc-generated
documentation you want to link to. If relative, the value
should be the relative path from the destination directory
(specified with -d) to the root of the packages being linked
to. For more details, see extdocURL in the -link option.</p>

<p>o packagelistLoc is the path or URL to the directory
containing the package-list file for the external
documentation. This can be a URL (http: or file:) or file
path, and can be absolute or relative. If relative, make it
relative to the current direc- tory from where javadoc was
run. Do not include the pack- age-list filename. You can
specify multiple -linkoffline options in a given javadoc
run. (Prior to 1.2.2, it could be specified only once.)
Example using absolute links to the external docs - Let us
say you want to link to the java.lang, java.io and other
Java SE Platform packages at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/, but your shell
does not have web access. You could open the package-list
file in a browser at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/pack- age-list @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/package-list, save
it to a local directory, and point to this local copy with
the second argu- ment, packagelistLoc. In this example, the
package list file has been saved to the current directory
&quot;.&quot; . The following command gen- erates
documentation for the package com.mypackage with links to
the Java SE Platform packages. The generated documentation
will contain links to the Object class, for example, in the
class trees. (Other necessary options, such as -sourcepath,
are not shown.)</p>

<p>% javadoc -linkoffline
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/ . com.mypackage
Example using relative links to the external docs - Its not
very common to use -linkoffline with relative paths, for the
simple rea- son that -link usually suffices. When using
-linkoffline, the pack- age-list file is generally local,
and when using relative links, the file you are linking to
is also generally local. So it is usually unnecessary to
give a different path for the two arguments to -linkoffline.
When the two arguments are identical, you can use -link. See
the -link relative example. Manually Creating a package-list
File - If a package-list file does not yet exist, but you
know what package names your document will link to, you can
create your own copy of this file by hand and spec- ify its
path with packagelistLoc. An example would be the previous
case where the package list for com.spipackage did not exist
when com.apipackage was first generated. This technique is
useful when you need to generate documentation that links to
new external documentation whose package names you know, but
which is not yet published. This is also a way of creating
package-list files for packages generated with Javadoc 1.0
or 1.1, where package-list files were not generated.
Likewise, two companies can share their unpub- lished
package-list files, enabling them to release their
cross-linked documentation simultaneously. Linking to
Multiple Documents - You can include -linkoffline once for
each generated document you want to refer to (each option is
shown on a separate line for clarity): % javadoc
-linkoffline extdocURL1 packagelistLoc1 _ -linkoffline
extdocURL2 packagelistLoc2 _ ... Updating docs - Another use
for -linkoffline option is useful if your project has dozens
or hundreds of packages, if you have already run javadoc on
the entire tree, and now, in a separate run, you want to
quickly make some small changes and re-run javadoc on just a
small portion of the source tree. This is somewhat of a hack
in that it works properly only if your changes are only to
doc comments and not to declarations. If you were to add,
remove or change any decla- rations from the source code,
then broken links could show up in the index, package tree,
inherited member lists, use page, and other places. First,
you create a new destination directory (call it update) for
this new small run. Let us say the original destination
directory was named html. In the simplest example, cd to the
parent of html. Set the first argument of -linkoffline to
the current directory &quot;.&quot; and set the second
argument to the relative path to html, where it can find
package-list, and pass in only the package names of the
packages you want to update:</p>

<p>% javadoc -d update -linkoffline . html com.mypackage
When the Javadoc tool is done, copy these generated class
pages in update/com/package (not the overview or index),
over the original files in html/com/package.</p>

<p>-linksource Creates an HTML version of each source file
(with line numbers) and adds links to them from the standard
HTML documentation. Links are created for classes,
interfaces, constructors, methods and fields whose
declarations are in a source file. Otherwise, links are not
created, such as for default constructors and gen- erated
classes. This option exposes all private implementation
details in the included source files, including private
classes, private fields, and the bodies of private methods,
regardless of the -public, -package, -protected and -private
options. Unless you also use the -private option, not all
private classes or interfaces will necessarily be accessible
via links. Each link appears on the name of the identifier
in its declara- tion. For example, the link to the source
code of the Button class would be on the word
&quot;Button&quot;:</p>

<p>public class Button extends Component implements
Accessible</p>

<p>and the link to the source code of the getLabel() method
in the Button class would be on the word
&quot;getLabel&quot;:</p>

<p>public String getLabel()</p>

<p>-group groupheading packagepattern:packagepattern:...
Separates packages on the overview page into whatever groups
you specify, one group per table. You specify each group
with a dif- ferent -group option. The groups appear on the
page in the order specified on the command line; packages
are alphabetized within a group. For a given -group option,
the packages matching the list of packagepattern expressions
appear in a table with the heading groupheading.</p>

<p>o groupheading can be any text, and can include white
space. This text is placed in the table heading for the
group.</p>

<p>o packagepattern can be any package name, or can be the
start of any package name followed by an asterisk (*). The
asterisk is a wildcard meaning &quot;match any
characters&quot;. This is the only wild- card allowed.
Multiple patterns can be included in a group by separating
them with colons (:). NOTE: If using an asterisk in a
pattern or pattern list, the pattern list must be inside
quotes, such as &quot;java.lang*:java.util&quot; If you do
not supply any -group option, all packages are placed in one
group with the heading &quot;Packages&quot;. If the all
groups do not include all documented packages, any leftover
packages appear in a separate group with the heading
&quot;Other Packages&quot;. For example, the following
option separates the four documented packages into core,
extension and other packages. Notice the trail- ing
&quot;dot&quot; does not appear in &quot;java.lang*&quot; --
including the dot, such as &quot;java.lang.*&quot; would
omit the java.lang package.</p>

<p>% javadoc -group &quot;Core Packages&quot;
&quot;java.lang*:java.util&quot; -group &quot;Extension
Packages&quot; &quot;javax.*&quot; java.lang
java.lang.reflect java.util javax.servlet java.new This
results in the groupings:</p>

<p>Core Packages java.lang java.lang.reflect java.util</p>

<p>Extension Packages javax.servlet</p>

<p>Other Packages java.new</p>

<p>-nodeprecated Prevents the generation of any deprecated
API at all in the docu- mentation. This does what
-nodeprecatedlist does, plus it does not generate any
deprecated API throughout the rest of the docu- mentation.
This is useful when writing code and you dont want to be
distracted by the deprecated code.</p>

<p>-nodeprecatedlist Prevents the generation of the file
containing the list of depre- cated APIs
(deprecated-list.html) and the link in the navigation bar to
that page. (However, javadoc continues to generate the
deprecated API throughout the rest of the document.) This is
use- ful if your source code contains no deprecated API, and
you want to make the navigation bar cleaner.</p>

<p>-nosince Omits from the generated docs the
&quot;Since&quot; sections associated with the @since
tags.</p>

<p>-notree Omits the class/interface hierarchy pages from
the generated docs. These are the pages you reach using the
&quot;Tree&quot; button in the navigation bar. The hierarchy
is produced by default.</p>

<p>-noindex Omits the index from the generated docs. The
index is produced by default.</p>

<p>-nohelp Omits the HELP link in the navigation bars at
the top and bottom of each page of output.</p>

<p>-nonavbar Prevents the generation of the navigation bar,
header and footer, otherwise found at the top and bottom of
the generated pages. Has no affect on the &quot;bottom&quot;
option. The -nonavbar option is useful when you are
interested only in the content and have no need for
navigation, such as converting the files to PostScript or
PDF for print only.</p>

<p>-helpfile path/filename Specifies the path of an
alternate help file path/filename that the HELP link in the
top and bottom navigation bars link to. Without this option,
the Javadoc tool automatically creates a help file
help-doc.html that is hard-coded in the Javadoc tool. This
option enables you to override this default. The filename
can be any name and is not restricted to help-doc.html --
the Javadoc tool will adjust the links in the navigation bar
accordingly. For example:</p>

<p>% javadoc -helpfile /home/user/myhelp.html java.awt</p>

<p>-stylesheetfile path/filename Specifies the path of an
alternate HTML stylesheet file. Without this option, the
Javadoc tool automatically creates a stylesheet file
stylesheet.css that is hard-coded in the Javadoc tool. This
option enables you to override this default. The filename
can be any name and is not restricted to stylesheet.css. For
example:</p>

<p>% javadoc -stylesheetfile /home/user/mystylesheet.css
com.mypackage</p>

<p>-serialwarn Generates compile-time warnings for missing
@serial tags. By default, Javadoc 1.2.2 (and later versions)
generates no serial warnings. (This is a reversal from
earlier versions.) Use this option to display the serial
warnings, which helps to properly document default
serializable fields and writeExternal methods.</p>

<p>-charset name Specifies the HTML character set for this
document. The name should be a preferred MIME name as given
in the IANA Registry @
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. For
example:</p>

<p>% javadoc -charset &quot;iso-8859-1&quot; mypackage
would insert the following line in the head of every
generated page:</p>

<p>&lt;META http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;
content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>This META tag is described in the HTML standard @
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.2.2.
(4197265 and 4137321) Also see -encoding and
-docencoding.</p>

<p>-docencoding name Specifies the encoding of the
generated HTML files. The name should be a preferred MIME
name as given in the IANA Registry @
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets. If you omit
this option but use -encoding, then the encoding of the
generated HTML files is determined by -encoding.
Example:</p>

<p>% javadoc -docencoding &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; mypackage
Also see -encoding and -charset.</p>

<p>-keywords Adds HTML meta keyword tags to the generated
file for each class. These tags can help the page be found
by search engines that look for meta tags. (Most search
engines that search the entire Inter- net do not look at
meta tags, because pages can misuse them; but search engines
offered by companies that confine their search to their own
website can benefit by looking at meta tags.) The meta tags
include the fully qualified name of the class and the
unqualified names of the fields and methods. Constructors
are not included because they are identical to the class
name. For example, the class String starts with these
keywords:</p>

<p>&lt;META NAME=&quot;keywords&quot;
CONTENT=&quot;java.lang.String class&quot;&gt; &lt;META
NAME=&quot;keywords&quot;
CONTENT=&quot;CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER&quot;&gt; &lt;META
NAME=&quot;keywords&quot; CONTENT=&quot;length()&quot;&gt;
&lt;META NAME=&quot;keywords&quot;
CONTENT=&quot;charAt()&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>-tag tagname:Xaoptcmf:&quot;taghead&quot; Enables the
Javadoc tool to interpret a simple, one-argument cus- tom
block tag @tagname in doc comments. So the Javadoc tool can
&quot;spell-check&quot; tag names, it is important to
include a -tag option for every custom tag that is present
in the source code, dis- abling (with X) those that are not
being output in the current run. The colon (:) is always the
separator. To use a colon in tagname, see Use of Colon in
Tag Name. The -tag option outputs the tags heading taghead
in bold, fol- lowed on the next line by the text from its
single argument, as shown in the example below. Like any
block tag, this arguments text can contain inline tags,
which are also interpreted. The output is similar to
standard one-argument tags, such as @return and @author.
Omitting taghead causes tagname to appear as the heading.
Placement of tags - The Xaoptcmf part of the argument
determines where in the source code the tag is allowed to be
placed, and whether the tag can be disabled (using X). You
can supply either a, to allow the tag in all places, or any
combination of the other letters: X (disable tag) a (all) o
(overview) p (packages) t (types, that is classes and
interfaces) c (constructors) m (methods) f (fields) Examples
of single tags - An example of a tag option for a tag that
can be used anywhere in the source code is:</p>

<p>-tag todo:a:&quot;To Do:&quot;</p>

<p>If you wanted @todo to be used only with constructors,
methods and fields, you would use:</p>

<p>-tag todo:cmf:&quot;To Do:&quot;</p>

<p>Notice the last colon (:) above is not a parameter
separator, but is part of the heading text (as shown below).
You would use either tag option for source code that
contains the tag @todo, such as:</p>

<p>@todo The documentation for this method needs work.</p>

<p>Use of Colon in Tag Name - A colon can be used in a tag
name if it is escaped with a backslash. For this doc
comment:</p>

<p>/** * @ejb:bean */</p>

<p>use this tag option:</p>

<p>-tag ej:bean:a:&quot;EJB Bean:&quot;</p>

<p>Spell-checking tag names (Disabling tags) - Some
developers put custom tags in the source code that they dont
always want to output. In these cases, it is important to
list all tags that are present in the source code, enabling
the ones you want to output and disabling the ones you dont
want to output. The presence of X disables the tag, while
its absence enables the tag. This gives the Javadoc tool
enough information to know if a tag it encoun- ters is
unknown, probably the results of a typo or a misspelling. It
prints a warning in these cases. You can add X to the
placement values already present, so that when you want to
enable the tag, you can simply delete the X. For example, if
@todo is a tag that you want to suppress on output, you
would use:</p>

<p>-tag todo:Xcmf:&quot;To Do:&quot;</p>

<p>or, if youd rather keep it simple:</p>

<p>-tag todo:X</p>

<p>The syntax -tag todo:X works even if @todo is defined by
a taglet. Order of tags - The order of the -tag (and
-taglet) options determine the order the tags are output.
You can mix the custom tags with the standard tags to
intersperse them. The tag options for standard tags are
placeholders only for determining the order -- they take
only the standard tag s name. (Subheadings for stan- dard
tags cannot be altered.) This is illustrated in the follow-
ing example. If -tag is missing, then the position of
-taglet determines its order. If they are both present, then
whichever appears last on the command line determines its
order. (This happens because the tags and taglets are
processed in the order that they appear on the command line.
For example, if -taglet and -tag both have the name
&quot;todo&quot;, the one that appears last on the command
line will determine its order. Example of a complete set of
tags - This example inserts &quot;To Do&quot; after
&quot;Parameters&quot; and before &quot;Throws&quot; in the
output. By using &quot;X&quot;, it also specifies that
@example is a tag that might be encountered in the source
code that should not be output during this run. Notice that
if you use @argfile, you can put the tags on separate lines
in an argument file like this (no line continu- ation
characters needed):</p>

<p>-tag param -tag return -tag todo:a:&quot;To Do:&quot;
-tag throws -tag see -tag example:X</p>

<p>When javadoc parses the doc comments, any tag
encountered that is neither a standard tag nor passed in
with -tag or -taglet is con- sidered unknown, and a warning
is thrown. The standard tags are initially stored internally
in a list in their default order. Whenever -tag options are
used, those tags get appended to this list -- standard tags
are moved from their default position. Therefore, if a -tag
option is omitted for a standard tag, it remains in its
default position. Avoiding Conflicts - If you want to slice
out your own namespace, you can use a dot-separated naming
convention similar to that used for packages:
com.mycompany.todo. Oracle will continue to create standard
tags whose names do not contain dots. Any tag you create
will override the behavior of a tag by the same name defined
by Oracle. In other words, if you create a tag or taglet
@todo, it will always have the same behavior you define,
even if Oracle later creates a standard tag of the same
name. Annotations vs. Javadoc Tags - In general, if the
markup you want to add is intended to affect or produce
documentation, it should probably be a javadoc tag;
otherwise, it should be an annotation. See Comparing
Annotations and Javadoc Tags @
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documenta-
tion/index-137868.html#annotations&lt; You can also create
more complex block tags, or custom inline tags with the
-taglet option.</p>

<p>-taglet class Specifies the class file that starts the
taglet used in generat- ing the documentation for that tag.
Use the fully-qualified name for class. This taglet also
defines the number of text arguments that the custom tag
has. The taglet accepts those arguments, pro- cesses them,
and generates the output. For extensive documenta- tion with
example taglets, see:</p>

<p>o Taglet Overview @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/javadoc/taglet/overview.html Taglets are useful
for block or inline tags. They can have any num- ber of
arguments and implement custom behavior, such as making text
bold, formatting bullets, writing out the text to a file, or
start- ing other processes. Taglets can only determine where
a tag should appear and in what form. All other decisions
are made by the doclet. So a taglet cannot do things such as
remove a class name from the list of included classes.
However, it can execute side effects, such as printing the
tags text to a file or triggering another process. Use the
-tagletpath option to specify the path to the taglet. Here
is an example that inserts the &quot;To Do&quot; taglet
after &quot;Parameters&quot; and ahead of &quot;Throws&quot;
in the generated pages:</p>

<p>-taglet com.sun.tools.doclets.ToDoTaglet -tagletpath
/home/taglets -tag return -tag param -tag todo -tag throws
-tag see</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the -taglet option in place
of its -tag option, but that may be harder to read.</p>

<p>-tagletpath tagletpathlist Specifies the search paths
for finding taglet class files (.class). The tagletpathlist
can contain multiple paths by sepa- rating them with a colon
(:). The Javadoc tool will search in all subdirectories of
the specified paths.</p>

<p>-docfilessubdirs Enables deep copying of
&quot;doc-files&quot; directories. In other words,
subdirectories and all contents are recursively copied to
the destination. For example, the directory
doc-files/example/images and all its contents would now be
copied. There is also an option to exclude
subdirectories.</p>

<p>-excludedocfilessubdir name1:name2... Excludes any
&quot;doc-files&quot; subdirectories with the given names.
This prevents the copying of SCCS and other
source-code-control subdirectories.</p>

<p>-noqualifier all | packagename1:packagename2:... Omits
qualifying package name from ahead of class names in out-
put. The argument to -noqualifier is either &quot;all&quot;
(all package qualifiers are omitted) or a colon-separate
list of packages, with wildcards, to be removed as
qualifiers. The package name is removed from places where
class or interface names appear. The following example omits
all package qualifiers:</p>

<p>-noqualifier all</p>

<p>The following example omits &quot;java.lang&quot; and
&quot;java.io&quot; package qualifiers:</p>

<p>-noqualifier java.lang:java.io</p>

<p>The following example omits package qualifiers starting
with &quot;java&quot;, and &quot;com.sun&quot; subpackages
(but not &quot;javax&quot;):</p>

<p>-noqualifier java.*:com.sun.*</p>

<p>Where a package qualifier would appear due to the above
behavior, the name can be suitably shortened -- see How a
name is dis- played. This rule is in effect whether or not
-noqualifier is used.</p>

<p>-notimestamp Suppresses the timestamp, which is hidden
in an HTML comment in the generated HTML near the top of
each page. Useful when you want to run javadoc on two source
bases and diff them, as it pre- vents timestamps from
causing a diff (which would otherwise be a diff on every
page). The timestamp includes the javadoc version number,
and currently looks like this:</p>

<p>&lt;!-- Generated by javadoc (build 1.5.0_01) on Thu Apr
02 14:04:52 IST 2009 --&gt;</p>

<p>-nocomment Suppress the entire comment body, including
the main description and all tags, generating only
declarations. This option enables re-using source files
originally intended for a different pur- pose, to produce
skeleton HTML documentation at the early stages of a new
project.</p>

<p>-sourcetab tabLength Specify the number of spaces each
tab takes up in the source.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT FILES To shorten or simplify the
javadoc command line, you can specify one or more files that
themselves contain arguments to the javadoc command (except
-J options). This enables you to create javadoc commands of
any length on any operating system.</p>

<p>An argument file can include javac options and source
filenames in any combination. The arguments within a file
can be space-separated or newline-separated. If a filename
contains embedded spaces, put the whole filename in double
quotes.</p>

<p>Filenames within an argument file are relative to the
current direc- tory, not the location of the argument file.
Wildcards (*) are not allowed in these lists (such as for
specifying *.java). Use of the @ character to recursively
interpret files is not supported. The -J options are not
supported because they are passed to the launcher, which
does not support argument files.</p>

<p>When executing javadoc, pass in the path and name of
each argument file with the @ leading character. When
javadoc encounters an argument beginning with the character
@, it expands the contents of that file into the argument
list.</p>

<p>Example - Single Arg File You could use a single
argument file named &quot;argfile&quot; to hold all Javadoc
arguments:</p>

<p>% javadoc @argfile</p>

<p>This argument file could contain the contents of both
files shown in the next example.</p>

<p>Example - Two Arg Files You can create two argument
files -- one for the Javadoc options and the other for the
package names or source filenames: (Notice the fol- lowing
lists have no line-continuation characters.)</p>

<p>Create a file named &quot;options&quot; containing:</p>

<p>-d docs-filelist -use -splitindex -windowtitleJava SE 7
API Specification -doctitleJava SE 7 API Specification
-header&lt;b&gt;Java(TM) SE 7&lt;/b&gt; -bottom Copyright

<p>Create a file named &quot;packages&quot; containing:</p>

<p>com.mypackage1 com.mypackage2 com.mypackage3</p>

<p>You would then run javadoc with:</p>

<p>% javadoc @options @packages</p>

<p>Example - Arg Files with Paths The argument files can
have paths, but any filenames inside the files are relative
to the current working directory (not path1 or path2):</p>

<p>% javadoc @path1/options @path2/packages</p>

<p>Example - Option Arguments Here s an example of saving
just an argument to a javadoc option in an argument file.
Well use the -bottom option, since it can have a lengthy
argument. You could create a file named &quot;bottom&quot;
containing its text argument:</p>

<p>&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt; &lt;a
href=&quot;http://bugreport.sun.com/bugreport/&quot;&gt;Submit

<p>Then run the Javadoc tool with:</p>

<p>% javadoc -bottom @bottom @packages</p>

<p>Or you could include the -bottom option at the start of
the argument file, and then just run it as:</p>

<p>% javadoc @bottom @packages</p>

<p>Name Running</p>

<p>RUNNING JAVADOC Version Numbers - The version number of
javadoc can be determined using javadoc -J-version. The
version number of the standard doclet appears in its output
stream. It can be turned off with -quiet.</p>

<p>Public programmatic interface - To invoke the Javadoc
tool from within programs written in the Java language. This
interface is in com.sun.tools.javadoc.Main (and javadoc is
re-entrant). For more details, see Standard Doclet @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/stan-
dard-doclet.html#runningprogrammatically.</p>

<p>Running Doclets - The instructions given below are for
invoking the standard HTML doclet. To invoke a custom
doclet, use the -doclet and -docletpath options. For full,
working examples of running a particular doclet, see the MIF
Doclet documentation @
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/mifdoclet/docs/mifdoclet.html.</p>

<p>SIMPLE EXAMPLES You can run javadoc on entire packages
or individual source files. Each package name has a
corresponding directory name. In the following exam- ples,
the source files are located at /home/src/java/awt/*.java.
The destination directory is /home/html.</p>

<p>Documenting One or More Packages To document a package,
the source files (*.java) for that package must be located
in a directory having the same name as the package. If a
package name is made up of several identifiers (separated by
dots, such as java.awt.color), each subsequent identifier
must correspond to a deeper subdirectory (such as
java/awt/color). You may split the source files for a single
package among two such directory trees located at different
places, as long as -sourcepath points to them both -- for
example src1/java/awt/color and src2/java/awt/color.</p>

<p>You can run javadoc either by changing directories (with
cd) or by using -sourcepath option. The examples below
illustrate both alterna- tives.</p>

<p>o Case 1 - Run recursively starting from one or more
packages - This example uses -sourcepath so javadoc can be
run from any directory and -subpackages (a new 1.4 option)
for recursion. It traverses the subpackages of the java
directory excluding packages rooted at java.net and
java.lang. Notice this excludes java.lang.ref, a sub-
package of java.lang).</p>

<p>% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src
-subpackages java -exclude java.net:java.lang</p>

<p>To also traverse down other package trees, append their
names to the -subpackages argument, such as
java:javax:org.xml.sax.</p>

<p>o Case 2 - Run on explicit packages after changing to
the &quot;root&quot; source directory - Change to the parent
directory of the fully-qualified package. Then run javadoc,
supplying names of one or more packages you want to
document:</p>

<p>% cd /home/src/ % javadoc -d /home/html java.awt
java.awt.event</p>

<p>o Case 3 - Run from any directory on explicit packages
in a single directory tree - In this case, it doesnt matter
what the current directory is. Run javadoc supplying
-sourcepath with the parent directory of the top-level
package, and supplying names of one or more packages you
want to document:</p>

<p>% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src java.awt
java.awt.event</p>

<p>o Case 4 - Run from any directory on explicit packages
in multiple directory trees - This is the same as case 3,
but for packages in separate directory trees. Run javadoc
supplying -sourcepath with the path to each tree s root
(colon-separated) and supply names of one or more packages
you want to document. All source files for a given package
do not need to be located under a single root direc- tory --
they just need to be found somewhere along the
sourcepath.</p>

<p>% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath
/home/src1:/home/src2 java.awt java.awt.event</p>

<p>Result: All cases generate HTML-formatted documentation
for the public and protected classes and interfaces in
packages java.awt and java.awt.event and save the HTML files
in the specified destination directory (/home/html). Because
two or more packages are being gener- ated, the document has
three HTML frames -- for the list of packages, the list of
classes, and the main class pages.</p>

<p>Documenting One or More Classes The second way to run
the Javadoc tool is by passing in one or more source files
(.java). You can run javadoc either of the following two
ways -- by changing directories (with cd) or by
fully-specifying the path to the .java files. Relative paths
are relative to the current directory. The -sourcepath
option is ignored when passing in source files. You can use
command line wildcards, such as asterisk (*), to specify
groups of classes.</p>

<p>o Case 1 - Changing to the source directory - Change to
the direc- tory holding the .java files. Then run javadoc,
supplying names of one or more source files you want to
document.</p>

<p>% cd /home/src/java/awt % javadoc -d /home/html
Button.java Canvas.java Graphics*.java This example
generates HTML-formatted documentation for the classes
Button, Canvas and classes beginning with Graphics. Because
source files rather than package names were passed in as
arguments to javadoc, the document has two frames -- for the
list of classes and the main page.</p>

<p>o Case 2 - Changing to the package root directory - This
is useful for documenting individual source files from
different subpackages off the same root. Change to the
package root directory, and sup- ply the source files with
paths from the root.</p>

<p>% cd /home/src/ % javadoc -d /home/html
java/awt/Button.java java/applet/Applet.java This example
generates HTML-formatted documentation for the classes
Button and Applet.</p>

<p>o Case 3 - From any directory - In this case, it doesnt
matter what the current directory is. Run javadoc supplying
the absolute path (or path relative to the current
directory) to the .java files you want to document.</p>

<p>% javadoc -d /home/html /home/src/java/awt/Button.java
/home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java This example generates
HTML-formatted documentation for the class Button and
classes beginning with Graphics.</p>

<p>Documenting Both Packages and Classes You can document
entire packages and individual classes at the same time.
Heres an example that mixes two of the previous examples.
You can use -sourcepath for the path to the packages but not
for the path to the individual classes.</p>

<p>% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src java.awt
/home/src/java/applet/Applet.java</p>

<p>This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for
the package java.awt and class Applet. (The Javadoc tool
determines the package name for Applet from the package
declaration, if any, in the Applet.java source file.)</p>

<p>REAL WORLD EXAMPLE The Javadoc tool has many useful
options, some of which are more com- monly used than others.
Here is effectively the command we use to run the Javadoc
tool on the Java platform API. We use 180MB of memory to
generate the documentation for the 1500 (approx.) public and
protected classes in the Java SE Platform, Standard Edition,
v1.2.</p>

<p>The same example is shown twice -- first as executed on
the command line, then as executed from a makefile. It uses
absolute paths in the option arguments, which enables the
same javadoc command to be run from any directory.</p>

<p>Command Line Example The following example may be too
long for some shells such as DOS. You can use a command line
argument file (or write a shell script) to workaround this
limitation.</p>

<p>NOTES</p>

<p>o If you omit the -windowtitle option, the Javadoc tool
copies the doc title to the window title. The -windowtitle
text is basically the same as the -doctitle but without HTML
tags, to prevent those tags from appearing as raw text in
the window title.</p>

<p>o If you omit the -footer option, as done here, the
Javadoc tool copies the header text to the footer.</p>

<p>o Other important options you might want to use but not
needed in this example are -classpath and -link.</p>

<p>o Bugs and Limitations - You can also see some bugs
listed at Impor- tant Bug Fixes and Changes.</p>

<p>o Version number - See version numbers.</p>

<p>o Documents only legal classes - When documenting a
package, javadoc only reads files whose names are composed
of legal class names. You can prevent javadoc from parsing a
file by including, for example, a hyphen &quot;-&quot; in
its filename.</p>

<p>Errors and Warnings Error and warning messages contain
the filename and line number to the declaration line rather
than to the particular line in the doc comment.</p>

Javadoc tool is trying to load the class Class1.java in the
current directory. The class name is shown with its path
(absolute or relative), which in this case is the same as
./Class1.java.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT CLASSPATH Environment variable that provides
the path which javadoc uses to find user class files. This
environment variable is overridden by the -classpath option.
