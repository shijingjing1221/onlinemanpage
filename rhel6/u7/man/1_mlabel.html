<p>Name mlabel - make an MSDOS volume label</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mlabel command adds a volume label to a
disk. Its syntax is: mlabel [-vcsn] [-N serial]
drive:[new_label]</p>

<p>Mlabel displays the current volume label, if present. If
new_label is not given, and if neither the c nor the s
options are set, it prompts the user for a new volume label.
To delete an existing volume label, press return at the
prompt.</p>

<p>Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MS-DOS volume
label. If an invalid label is specified, mlabel changes the
label (and displays the new label if the verbose mode is
set). Mlabel returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.</p>

<p>Mlabel supports the following options:</p>

<p>c Clears an existing label, without prompting the
user</p>

<p>s Shows the existing label, without prompting the
user.</p>

<p>n Assigns a new (random) serial number to the disk</p>

<p>N serial Sets the supplied serial number. The serial
number should be supplied as an 8 digit hexadecimal number,
without spaces</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
