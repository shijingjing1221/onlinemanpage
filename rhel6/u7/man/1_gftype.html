<p>GFTYPE(1) GFTYPE(1)</p>

<p>NAME gftype - translate a generic font file for humans
to read</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gftype [ -i ] [ -m ] gf_file_name [
output_file_name ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The gftype program translates a gf (generic font) file
output by, for example, mf(1), to a file that humans can
read. It also serves as a gf file-validating program (i.e.,
if gftype can read it, it s correct) and as an example of a
gf-reading program for other software that wants to read gf
files.</p>

<p>The gf_file_name on the command line must be complete.
Because the res- olution is part of the extension, it would
not make sense to append a default extension as is done with
TeX or DVI-reading software. If no output_file_name is
specified, the output goes to stdout.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The output file includes bitmap images of the
characters, if -i is given on the command line, and a
symbolic listing of the gf commands, if -m is specified.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT gftype looks for gf_file_name using the
environment variable GFFONTS. If that is not set, it uses
the variable TEXFONTS. If that is not set, it uses the
system default.</p>

<p>AUTHORS David Fuchs and Don Knuth wrote the program. It
was published as part of the Metafontware technical report,
available from the TeX Users Group. Paul Richards originally
ported it to Unix.</p>
