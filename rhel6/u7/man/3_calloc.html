<p>MALLOC(3) Linux Programmer s Manual MALLOC(3)</p>

<p>NAME calloc, malloc, free, realloc - Allocate and free
dynamic memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size); void
*malloc(size_t size); void free(void *ptr); void
*realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION calloc() allocates memory for an array of
nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to
the allocated memory. The memory is set to zero. If nmemb or
size is 0, then calloc() returns either NULL, or a unique
pointer value that can later be successfully passed to
free().</p>

<p>malloc() allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to
the allocated memory. The memory is not cleared. If size is
0, then malloc() returns either NULL, or a unique pointer
value that can later be suc- cessfully passed to free().</p>

<p>free() frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which
must have been returned by a previous call to malloc(),
calloc() or realloc(). Other- wise, or if free(ptr) has
already been called before, undefined behav- ior occurs. If
ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.</p>

<p>realloc() changes the size of the memory block pointed
to by ptr to size bytes. The contents will be unchanged to
the minimum of the old and new sizes; newly allocated memory
will be uninitialized. If ptr is NULL, then the call is
equivalent to malloc(size), for all values of size; if size
is equal to zero, and ptr is not NULL, then the call is
equivalent to free(ptr). Unless ptr is NULL, it must have
been returned by an earlier call to malloc(), calloc() or
realloc(). If the area pointed to was moved, a free(ptr) is
done.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE For calloc() and malloc(), return a pointer
to the allocated memory, which is suitably aligned for any
kind of variable. On error, these functions return NULL.
NULL may also be returned by a successful call to malloc()
with a size of zero, or by a successful call to calloc()
with nmemb or size equal to zero.</p>

<p>free() returns no value.</p>

<p>realloc() returns a pointer to the newly allocated
memory, which is suitably aligned for any kind of variable
and may be different from ptr, or NULL if the request fails.
If size was equal to 0, either NULL or a pointer suitable to
be passed to free() is returned. If realloc() fails the
original block is left untouched; it is not freed or
moved.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C89, C99.</p>

<p>NOTES Normally, malloc() allocates memory from the heap,
and adjusts the size of the heap as required, using sbrk(2).
When allocating blocks of mem- ory larger than
MMAP_THRESHOLD bytes, the glibc malloc() implementation
allocates the memory as a private anonymous mapping using
mmap(2). MMAP_THRESHOLD is 128 kB by default, but is
adjustable using mal- lopt(3). Allocations performed using
mmap(2) are unaffected by the RLIMIT_DATA resource limit
(see getrlimit(2)).</p>

<p>The Unix98 standard requires malloc(), calloc(), and
realloc() to set errno to ENOMEM upon failure. Glibc assumes
that this is done (and the glibc versions of these routines
do this); if you use a private malloc implementation that
does not set errno, then certain library routines may fail
without having a reason in errno.</p>

<p>Crashes in malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), or free() are
almost always related to heap corruption, such as
overflowing an allocated chunk or freeing the same pointer
twice.</p>

<p>Recent versions of Linux libc (later than 5.4.23) and
glibc (2.x) include a malloc() implementation which is
tunable via environment variables. When MALLOC_CHECK_ is
set, a special (less efficient) implementation is used which
is designed to be tolerant against simple errors, such as
double calls of free() with the same argument, or over- runs
of a single byte (off-by-one bugs). Not all such errors can
be protected against, however, and memory leaks can result.
If MAL- LOC_CHECK_ is set to 0, any detected heap corruption
is silently ignored; if set to 1, a diagnostic message is
printed on stderr; if set to 2, abort(3) is called
immediately; if set to 3, a diagnostic message is printed on
stderr and the program is aborted. Using a non-zero MAL-
LOC_CHECK_ value can be useful because otherwise a crash may
happen much later, and the true cause for the problem is
then very hard to track down.</p>

<p>BUGS By default, Linux follows an optimistic memory
allocation strategy. This means that when malloc() returns
non-NULL there is no guarantee that the memory really is
available. This is a really bad bug. In case it turns out
that the system is out of memory, one or more pro- cesses
will be killed by the infamous OOM killer. In case Linux is
employed under circumstances where it would be less
desirable to sud- denly lose some randomly picked processes,
and moreover the kernel ver- sion is sufficiently recent,
one can switch off this overcommitting behavior using a
command like:</p>

<p># echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</p>

vm/overcommit- accounting and sysctl/vm.txt.</p>
