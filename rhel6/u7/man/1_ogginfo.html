<p>ogginfo(1) Vorbis Tools ogginfo(1)</p>

<p>NAME ogginfo - gives information about Ogg files, and
does extensive valid- ity checking</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ogginfo [ -q ] [ -v ] [ -h ] file1.ogg ...
fileN.ogg</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ogginfo reads one or more Ogg files and
prints information about stream contents (including chained
and/or multiplexed streams) to standard output. It will
detect (but not correct) a wide range of common defects,
with many additional checks specifically for Ogg Vorbis
streams.</p>

<p>For all stream types ogginfo will print the filename
being processed, the stream serial numbers, and various
common error conditions.</p>

<p>For Vorbis streams, information including the version
used for encod- ing, the sample rate and number of channels,
the bitrate and playback length, and the contents of the
comment header are printed.</p>

<p>Similarly, for Theora streams, basic information about
the video is provided, including frame rate, aspect ratio,
bitrate, length, and the comment header.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Show a help and usage message.</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode. This may be specified multiple times.
Doing so once will remove the detailed informative messages,
twice will remove warnings as well.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode. At the current time, this does not do
anything.</p>
