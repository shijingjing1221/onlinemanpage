<p>PTHREAD_CLEANUP_POP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_CLEANUP_POP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_cleanup_pop, pthread_cleanup_push -
establish cancellation han- dlers</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>void pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute); void
pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine)(void*), void *arg);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_cleanup_pop() function shall
remove the routine at the top of the calling threads
cancellation cleanup stack and optionally invoke it (if
execute is non-zero).</p>

<p>The pthread_cleanup_push() function shall push the
specified cancella- tion cleanup handler routine onto the
calling thread s cancellation cleanup stack. The
cancellation cleanup handler shall be popped from the
cancellation cleanup stack and invoked with the argument arg
when:</p>

<p>* The thread exits (that is, calls pthread_exit()).</p>

<p>* The thread acts upon a cancellation request.</p>

<p>* The thread calls pthread_cleanup_pop() with a non-zero
execute argu- ment.</p>

<p>These functions may be implemented as macros. The
application shall ensure that they appear as statements, and
in pairs within the same lexical scope (that is, the
pthread_cleanup_push() macro may be thought to expand to a
token list whose first token is { with pthread_cleanup_pop()
expanding to a token list whose last token is the
corresponding}).</p>

<p>The effect of calling longjmp() or siglongjmp() is
undefined if there have been any calls to
pthread_cleanup_push() or pthread_cleanup_pop() made without
the matching call since the jump buffer was filled. The
effect of calling longjmp() or siglongjmp() from inside a
cancellation cleanup handler is also undefined unless the
jump buffer was also filled in the cancellation cleanup
handler.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The pthread_cleanup_push() and
pthread_cleanup_pop() functions shall not return a
value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following is an example using thread
primitives to implement a can- celable, writers-priority
read-write lock:</p>

<p>typedef struct { pthread_mutex_t lock; pthread_cond_t
rcond, wcond; int lock_count; /* &lt; 0 .. Held by writer.
*/ /* &gt; 0 .. Held by lock_count readers. */ /* = 0 ..
Held by nobody. */ int waiting_writers; /* Count of waiting
writers. */ } rwlock;</p>

<p>void waiting_reader_cleanup(void *arg) { rwlock *l;</p>

<p>l = (rwlock *) arg;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;l-&gt;lock); }</p>

<p>void lock_for_read(rwlock *l) {
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;l-&gt;lock);
pthread_cleanup_push(waiting_reader_cleanup, l); while
((l-&gt;lock_count &lt; 0) &amp;&amp; (l-&gt;waiting_writers
!= 0)) pthread_cond_wait(&amp;l-&gt;rcond, &amp;l-&gt;lock);
l-&gt;lock_count++; /* * Note the pthread_cleanup_pop
executes * waiting_reader_cleanup. */
pthread_cleanup_pop(1); }</p>

<p>void release_read_lock(rwlock *l) {
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;l-&gt;lock); if (--l-&gt;lock_count
== 0) pthread_cond_signal(&amp;l-&gt;wcond);
pthread_mutex_unlock(l); }</p>

<p>void waiting_writer_cleanup(void *arg) { rwlock *l;</p>

<p>l = (rwlock *) arg; if ((--l-&gt;waiting_writers == 0)
&amp;&amp; (l-&gt;lock_count &gt;= 0)) { /* * This only
happens if we have been canceled. */
pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;l-&gt;wcond); }
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;l-&gt;lock); }</p>

<p>void lock_for_write(rwlock *l) {
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;l-&gt;lock);
l-&gt;waiting_writers++;
pthread_cleanup_push(waiting_writer_cleanup, l); while
(l-&gt;lock_count != 0) pthread_cond_wait(&amp;l-&gt;wcond,
&amp;l-&gt;lock); l-&gt;lock_count = -1; /* * Note the
pthread_cleanup_pop executes * waiting_writer_cleanup. */
pthread_cleanup_pop(1); }</p>

<p>void release_write_lock(rwlock *l) {
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;l-&gt;lock); l-&gt;lock_count = 0;
if (l-&gt;waiting_writers == 0)
pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;l-&gt;rcond) else
pthread_cond_signal(&amp;l-&gt;wcond);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;l-&gt;lock); }</p>

<p>/* * This function is called to initialize the
read/write lock. */ void initialize_rwlock(rwlock *l) {
pthread_mutex_init(&amp;l-&gt;lock,
pthread_mutexattr_default);
pthread_cond_init(&amp;l-&gt;wcond,
pthread_condattr_default);
pthread_cond_init(&amp;l-&gt;rcond,
pthread_condattr_default); l-&gt;lock_count = 0;
l-&gt;waiting_writers = 0; }</p>

<p>reader_thread() { lock_for_read(&amp;lock);
pthread_cleanup_push(release_read_lock, &amp;lock); /* *
Thread has read lock. */ pthread_cleanup_pop(1); }</p>

<p>writer_thread() { lock_for_write(&amp;lock);
pthread_cleanup_push(release_write_lock, &amp;lock); /* *
Thread has write lock. */ pthread_cleanup_pop(1); }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The two routines that push and pop
cancellation cleanup handlers, pthread_cleanup_push() and
pthread_cleanup_pop(), can be thought of as left and right
parentheses. They always need to be matched.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The restriction that the two routines that
push and pop cancellation cleanup handlers,
pthread_cleanup_push() and pthread_cleanup_pop(), have to
appear in the same lexical scope allows for efficient macro
or compiler implementations and efficient storage
management. A sample implementation of these routines as
macros might look like this:</p>

<p>#define pthread_cleanup_push(rtn,arg) { struct
_pthread_handler_rec __cleanup_handler, **__head;
__cleanup_handler.rtn = rtn; __cleanup_handler.arg = arg;
(void) pthread_getspecific(_pthread_handler_key,
&amp;__head); __cleanup_handler.next = *__head; *__head =
&amp;__cleanup_handler;</p>

<p>#define pthread_cleanup_pop(ex) *__head =
__cleanup_handler.next; if (ex)
(*__cleanup_handler.rtn)(__cleanup_handler.arg); }</p>

<p>A more ambitious implementation of these routines might
do even better by allowing the compiler to note that the
cancellation cleanup handler is a constant and can be
expanded inline.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 currently leaves
unspecified the effect of calling longjmp() from a signal
handler executing in a POSIX System Interfaces function. If
an implementation wants to allow this and give the
programmer reasonable behavior, the longjmp() function has
to call all cancellation cleanup handlers that have been
pushed but not popped since the time setjmp() was
called.</p>

<p>Consider a multi-threaded function called by a thread
that uses sig- nals. If a signal were delivered to a signal
handler during the opera- tion of qsort() and that handler
were to call longjmp() (which, in turn, did not call the
cancellation cleanup handlers) the helper threads created by
the qsort() function would not be canceled. Instead, they
would continue to execute and write into the argument array
even though the array might have been popped off the
stack.</p>

<p>Note that the specified cleanup handling mechanism is
especially tied to the C language and, while the requirement
for a uniform mechanism for expressing cleanup is
language-independent, the mechanism used in other languages
may be quite different. In addition, this mechanism is
really only necessary due to the lack of a real exception
mechanism in the C language, which would be the ideal
solution.</p>

<p>There is no notion of a cancellation cleanup-safe
function. If an application has no cancellation points in
its signal handlers, blocks any signal whose handler may
have cancellation points while calling async-unsafe
functions, or disables cancellation while calling async-
unsafe functions, all functions may be safely called from
cancellation cleanup routines.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
