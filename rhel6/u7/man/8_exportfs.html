<p>NAME exportfs - maintain table of exported NFS file
systems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /usr/sbin/exportfs [-avi] [-o options,..]
[client:/path ..] /usr/sbin/exportfs -r [-v]
/usr/sbin/exportfs [-av] -u [client:/path ..]
/usr/sbin/exportfs [-v] /usr/sbin/exportfs -f</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION An NFS server maintains a table of local
physical file systems that are accessible to NFS clients.
Each file system in this table is referred to as an exported
file system, or export, for short.</p>

<p>The exportfs command maintains the current table of
exports for the NFS server. The master export table is kept
in a file named /var/lib/nfs/etab. This file is read by
rpc.mountd when a client sends an NFS MOUNT request.</p>

<p>Normally the master export table is initialized with the
contents of /etc/exports and files under /etc/exports.d by
invoking exportfs -a. However, a system administrator can
choose to add or delete exports without modifying
/etc/exports or files under /etc/exports.d by using the
exportfs command.</p>

<p>exportfs and its partner program rpc.mountd work in one
of two modes: a legacy mode which applies to 2.4 and earlier
versions of the Linux ker- nel, and a new mode which applies
to 2.6 and later versions, providing the nfsd virtual
filesystem has been mounted at /proc/fs/nfsd or
/proc/fs/nfs. On 2.6 kernels, if this filesystem is not
mounted, the legacy mode is used.</p>

<p>In the new mode, exportfs does not give any information
to the kernel, but provides it only to rpc.mountd through
the /var/lib/nfs/etab file. rpc.mountd then manages kernel
requests for information about exports, as needed.</p>

<p>In the legacy mode, exports which identify a specific
host, rather than a subnet or netgroup, are entered directly
into the kernel s export ta- ble, as well as being written
to /var/lib/nfs/etab. Further, exports listed in
/var/lib/nfs/rmtab which match a non host-specific export
request will cause an appropriate export entry for the host
given in rmtab to be added to the kernels export table.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Export or unexport all directories.</p>

<p>-o options,... Specify a list of export options in the
same manner as in exports(5).</p>

<p>-i Ignore the /etc/exports file and files under
/etc/exports.d directory. Only default options and options
given on the com- mand line are used.</p>

<p>-r Reexport all directories, synchronizing
/var/lib/nfs/etab with /etc/exports and files under
/etc/exports.d. This option removes entries in
/var/lib/nfs/etab which have been deleted from /etc/exports
or files under /etc/exports.d, and removes any entries from
the kernel export table which are no longer valid.</p>

<p>-u Unexport one or more directories.</p>

<p>-f If /proc/fs/nfsd or /proc/fs/nfs is mounted, flush
everything out of the kernels export table. Fresh entries
for active clients are added to the kernels export table by
rpc.mountd when they make their next NFS mount request.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose. When exporting or unexporting, show whats
going on. When displaying the current export list, also
display the list of export options.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION Exporting Directories The first synopsis
shows how to invoke exportfs when adding new entries to the
export table. When using exportfs -a, all exports listed in
/etc/exports and files under /etc/exports.d are added to
/var/lib/nfs/etab. The kernels export table is also updated
as needed.</p>

<p>The host:/path argument specifies a local directory to
export, along with the client or clients who are permitted
to access it. See exports(5) for a description of supported
options and access list for- mats.</p>

<p>IPv6 presentation addresses contain colons, which are
already used to separate the &quot;host&quot; and
&quot;path&quot; command line arguments. When specifying a
client using a raw IPv6 address, enclose the address in
square brack- ets. For IPv6 network addresses, place the
prefix just after the clos- ing bracket.</p>

<p>To export a directory to the world, simply specify
:/path.</p>

<p>The export options for a particular host/directory pair
derive from several sources. The default export options are
sync,ro,root_squash,wdelay. These can be overridden by
entries in /etc/exports or files under /etc/exports.d.</p>

<p>A system administrator may override options from these
sources using the -o command-line option on exportfs. This
option takes a comma-sep- arated list of options in the same
fashion as one would specify them in /etc/exports. In this
way exportfs can be used to modify the export options of an
already exported directory.</p>

<p>Unexporting Directories The third synopsis shows how to
unexported a currently exported direc- tory. When using
exportfs -ua, all entries listed in /var/lib/nfs/etab are
removed from the kernel export tables, and the file is
cleared. This effectively shuts down all NFS activity.</p>

<p>To remove an export, specify a host:/path pair. This
deletes the speci- fied entry from /var/lib/nfs/etab and
removes the corresponding kernel entry (if any).</p>

<p>Dumping the Export Table Invoking exportfs without
options shows the current list of exported file systems.
Adding the -v option causes exportfs to display the export
options for each export.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following adds all directories listed in
/etc/exports and files under /etc/exports.d to
/var/lib/nfs/etab and pushes the resulting export entries
into the kernel:</p>

<p># exportfs -a</p>

<p>To export the /usr/tmp directory to host django,
allowing insecure file locking requests from clients:</p>

<p># exportfs -o insecure_locks django:/usr/tmp</p>

<p>To unexport the /usr/tmp directory:</p>

<p># exportfs -u django:/usr/tmp</p>

<p>To unexport all exports listed in /etc/exports and files
under /etc/exports.d:</p>

<p># exportfs -au</p>

<p>To export the /usr/tmp directory to IPv6 link-local
clients:</p>

<p># exportfs [fe80::]/64:/usr/tmp</p>

<p>USAGE NOTES Exporting to IP networks or DNS and NIS
domains does not enable clients from these groups to access
NFS immediately. Rather, these sorts of exports are hints to
rpc.mountd(8) to grant any mount requests from these
clients. This is usually not a problem, because any existing
mounts are preserved in rmtab across reboots.</p>

<p>When unexporting a network or domain entry, any current
exports to mem- bers of this group will be checked against
the remaining valid exports and if they themselves are no
longer valid they will be removed.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/exports input file listing exports, export
options, and access control lists</p>

<p>/etc/exports.d directory where extra input files are
stored. Note: only files that end with .exports are
used.</p>

<p>/var/lib/nfs/etab master table of exports</p>

<p>/var/lib/nfs/rmtab table of clients accessing server s
exports</p>
