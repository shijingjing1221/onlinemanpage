<p>NAME Tcl_PrintDouble - Convert floating value to
string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_PrintDouble(interp, value, dst)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Before Tcl 8.0, the
tcl_precision variable in this interpreter con- trolled the
conversion. As of Tcl 8.0, this argument is ignored and the
conversion is controlled by the tcl_precision variable that
is now shared by all interpreters.</p>

<p>double value (in) Floating-point value to be
converted.</p>

<p>char *dst (out) Where to store the string representing
value. Must have at least TCL_DOU- BLE_SPACE characters of
storage.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_PrintDouble generates a string that
represents the value of value and stores it in memory at the
location given by dst. It uses %g for- mat to generate the
string, with one special twist: the string is guar- anteed
to contain either a . or an e so that it does not look like
an integer. Where %g would generate an integer with no
decimal point, Tcl_PrintDouble adds .0.</p>

<p>If the tcl_precision value is non-zero, the result will
have precisely that many digits of significance. If the
value is zero (the default), the result will have the fewest
digits needed to represent the number in such a way that
Tcl_NewDoubleObj will generate the same number when
presented with the given string. IEEE semantics of rounding
to even apply to the conversion.</p>
