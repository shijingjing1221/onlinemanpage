<p>MALLOC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MALLOC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME malloc - a memory allocator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *malloc(size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The malloc() function shall allocate unused
space for an object whose size in bytes is specified by size
and whose value is unspecified.</p>

<p>The order and contiguity of storage allocated by
successive calls to malloc() is unspecified. The pointer
returned if the allocation suc- ceeds shall be suitably
aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type
of object and then used to access such an object in the
space allocated (until the space is explicitly freed or
reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to
an object disjoint from any other object. The pointer
returned points to the start (lowest byte address) of the
allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null
pointer shall be returned. If the size of the space
requested is 0, the behavior is implementation-defined: the
value returned shall be either a null pointer or a unique
pointer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion with size not
equal to 0, malloc() shall return a pointer to the allocated
space. If size is 0, either a null pointer or a unique
pointer that can be successfully passed to free() shall be
returned. Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The malloc() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>
