<p>PERL585DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL585DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl585delta - what is new for perl v5.8.5</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.8.4 release and the 5.8.5 release.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes There are no changes incompatible
with 5.8.4.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements Perl s regular expression engine now
contains support for matching on the intersection of two
Unicode character classes. You can also now refer to
user-defined character classes from within other user
defined character classes.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata &middot; Carp improved to work
nicely with Safe. Carps message reporting should now be
anomaly free - it will always print out line number
information.</p>

<p>&middot; CGI upgraded to version 3.05</p>

<p>&middot; charnames now avoids clobbering $_</p>

<p>&middot; Digest upgraded to version 1.08</p>

<p>&middot; Encode upgraded to version 2.01</p>

<p>&middot; FileCache upgraded to version 1.04</p>

<p>&middot; libnet upgraded to version 1.19</p>

<p>&middot; Pod::Parser upgraded to version 1.28</p>

<p>&middot; Pod::Perldoc upgraded to version 3.13</p>

<p>&middot; Pod::LaTeX upgraded to version 0.57</p>

<p>&middot; Safe now works properly with Carp</p>

<p>&middot; Scalar-List-Utils upgraded to version 1.14</p>

<p>&middot; Shells documentation has been re-written, and
its historical partial auto-quoting of command arguments can
now be disabled.</p>

<p>&middot; Test upgraded to version 1.25</p>

<p>&middot; Test::Harness upgraded to version 2.42</p>

<p>&middot; Time::Local upgraded to version 1.10</p>

<p>&middot; Unicode::Collate upgraded to version 0.40</p>

<p>&middot; Unicode::Normalize upgraded to version 0.30</p>

<p>Utility Changes Pers debugger The debugger can now
emulate stepping backwards, by restarting and rerunning all
bar the last command from a saved command history.</p>

<p>h2ph h2ph is now able to understand a very limited set
of C inline functions -- basically, the inline functions
that look like CPP macros. This has been introduced to deal
with some of the headers of the newest versions of the
glibc. The standard warning still applies; to quote h2phs
documentation, you may need to dicker with the files
produced.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements Perl 5.8.5
should build cleanly from source on LynxOS.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes &middot; The in-place sort
optimisation introduced in 5.8.4 had a bug. For example, in
code such as</p>

<p>@a = sort ($b, @a)</p>

<p>the result would omit the value $b. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; The optimisation for unnecessary assignments
introduced in 5.8.4 could give spurious warnings. This has
been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Perl should now correctly detect and read
BOM-marked and (BOMless) UTF-16 scripts of either
endianness.</p>

<p>&middot; Creating a new thread when weak references
exist was buggy, and would often cause warnings at
interpreter destruction time. The known bug is now
fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Several obscure bugs involving manipulating
Unicode strings with &quot;substr&quot; have been fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Previously if Perls file globbing function
encountered a directory that it did not have permission to
open it would return immediately, leading to unexpected
truncation of the list of results. This has been fixed, to
be consistent with Unix shells globbing behaviour.</p>

<p>&middot; Thread creation time could vary wildly between
identical runs. This was caused by a poor hashing algorithm
in the thread cloning routines, which has now been
fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; The internals of the ithreads implementation
were not checking if OS-level thread creation had failed.
threads-&gt;create() now returns &quot;undef&quot; in if
thread creation fails instead of crashing perl.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics &middot; Perl -V has several
improvements</p>

<p>&middot; correctly outputs local patch names that
contain embedded code snippets or other characters that used
to confuse it.</p>

<p>&middot; arguments to -V that look like regexps will
give multiple lines of output.</p>

<p>&middot; a trailing colon suppresses the linefeed and ;
terminator, allowing embedding of queries into shell
commands.</p>

<p>&middot; a leading colon removes the name= part of the
response, allowing mapping to any name.</p>

<p>&middot; When perl fails to find the specified script,
it now outputs a second line suggesting that the user use
the &quot;-S&quot; flag:</p>

<p>$ perl5.8.5 missing.pl Can&rsquo;t open perl script
&quot;missing.pl&quot;: No such file or directory. Use -S to
search $PATH for it.</p>

<p>Changed Internals The Unicode character class files used
by the regular expression engine are now built at build time
from the supplied Unicode consortium data files, instead of
being shipped prebuilt. This makes the compressed Perl
source tarball about 200K smaller. A side effect is that the
layout of files inside lib/unicore has changed.</p>

<p>Known Problems The regression test t/uni/class.t is now
performing considerably more tests, and can take several
minutes to run even on a fast machine.</p>

<p>Platform Specific Problems This release is known not to
build on Windows 95.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs
at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
