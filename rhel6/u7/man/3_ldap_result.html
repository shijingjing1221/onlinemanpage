<p>LDAP_RESULT(3) LDAP_RESULT(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_result - Wait for the result of an LDAP
operation</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_result( LDAP *ld, int msgid, int all, struct
timeval *timeout, LDAPMessage **result );</p>

<p>int ldap_msgfree( LDAPMessage *msg );</p>

<p>int ldap_msgtype( LDAPMessage *msg );</p>

<p>int ldap_msgid( LDAPMessage *msg );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ldap_result() routine is used to wait
for and return the result of an operation previously
initiated by one of the LDAP asynchronous oper- ation
routines (e.g., ldap_search_ext(3), ldap_modify_ext(3),
etc.). Those routines all return -1 in case of error, and an
invocation iden- tifier upon successful initiation of the
operation. The invocation identifier is picked by the
library and is guaranteed to be unique across the LDAP
session. It can be used to request the result of a specific
operation from ldap_result() through the msgid
parameter.</p>

<p>The ldap_result() routine will block or not, depending
upon the setting of the timeout parameter. If timeout is not
a NULL pointer, it spec- ifies a maximum interval to wait
for the selection to complete. If timeout is a NULL pointer,
the LDAP_OPT_TIMEOUT value set by ldap_set_option(3) is
used. With the default setting, the select blocks
indefinitely. To effect a poll, the timeout argument should
be a non-NULL pointer, pointing to a zero-valued timeval
struc- ture. To obtain the behavior of the default setting,
bypassing any value set by ldap_set_option(3), set to -1 the
tv_sec field of the timeout parameter. See select(2) for
further details.</p>

<p>If the result of a specific operation is required, msgid
should be set to the invocation identifier returned when the
operation was initiated, otherwise LDAP_RES_ANY or
LDAP_RES_UNSOLICITED should be supplied to wait for any or
unsolicited response.</p>

<p>The all parameter, if non-zero, causes ldap_result() to
return all responses with msgid, otherwise only the next
response is returned. This is commonly used to obtain all
the responses of a search opera- tion.</p>

<p>A search response is made up of zero or more search
entries, zero or more search references, and zero or more
extended partial responses followed by a search result. If
all is set to 0, search entries will be returned one at a
time as they come in, via separate calls to ldap_result().
If its set to 1, the search response will only be returned
in its entirety, i.e., after all entries, all references,
all extended partial responses, and the final search result
have been received.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon success, the type of the result
received is returned and the result parameter will contain
the result of the operation; otherwise, the result parameter
is undefined. This result should be passed to the LDAP
parsing routines, ldap_first_message(3) and friends, for
interpre- tation.</p>

<p>The possible result types returned are:</p>

<p>LDAP_RES_BIND (0x61) LDAP_RES_SEARCH_ENTRY (0x64)
LDAP_RES_SEARCH_REFERENCE (0x73) LDAP_RES_SEARCH_RESULT
(0x65) LDAP_RES_MODIFY (0x67) LDAP_RES_ADD (0x69)
LDAP_RES_DELETE (0x6b) LDAP_RES_MODDN (0x6d)
LDAP_RES_COMPARE (0x6f) LDAP_RES_EXTENDED (0x78)
LDAP_RES_INTERMEDIATE (0x79)</p>

<p>The ldap_msgfree() routine is used to free the memory
allocated for result(s) by ldap_result() or
ldap_search_ext_s(3) and friends. It takes a pointer to the
result or result chain to be freed and returns the type of
the last message in the chain. If the parameter is NULL, the
function does nothing and returns zero.</p>

<p>The ldap_msgtype() routine returns the type of a
message.</p>

<p>The ldap_msgid() routine returns the message id of a
message.</p>

<p>ERRORS ldap_result() returns -1 if something bad
happens, and zero if the timeout specified was exceeded.
ldap_msgtype() and ldap_msgid() return -1 on error.</p>
