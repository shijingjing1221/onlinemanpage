<p>AUDISP-RACF(8) System Administration Utilities

<p>NAME audispd-zos-remote - z/OS Remote-services Audit
dispatcher plugin</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS audispd-zos-remote [ config-file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION audispd-zos-remote is a remote-auditing
plugin for the Audit subsystem. It should be started by the
audispd(8) daemon and will forward all incoming audit
events, as they happen, to a configured z/OS SMF (Ser- vice
Management Facility) database, through an IBM Tivoli
Directory Server (ITDS) set for Remote Audit service. See
SMF MAPPING section below for more information about the
resulting SMF record format.</p>

<p>audispd(8) must be configured to start the plugin. This
is done by a configuration file usually located at
/etc/audisp/plugins.d/aud- ispd-zos-remote.conf, but
multiple instances can be spawned by having multiple
configuration files in /etc/audisp/plugins.d for the same
plu- gin executable (see audispd(8)).</p>

<p>Each instance needs a configuration file, located by
default at /etc/audisp/zos-remote.conf. Check
zos-remote.conf(5) for details about the plugin
configuration.</p>

<p>OPTIONS config-file Use an alternate configuration file
instead of /etc/aud- isp/zos-remote.conf.</p>

<p>SIGNALS audispd-zos-remote reacts to SIGTERM and SIGHUP
signals (according to the audispd(8) specification):</p>

<p>SIGHUP Instructs the audispd-zos-remote plugin to
re-read its configu- ration and flush existing network
connections.</p>

<p>SIGTERM Performs a clean exit. audispd-zos-remote will
wait up to 10 seconds if there are queued events to be
delivered, dropping any remaining queued events after that
time.</p>

<p>IBM z/OS ITDS Server and RACF configuration In order to
use this plugin, you must have an IBM z/OS v1R8 (or higher)
server with IBM Tivoli Directory Server (ITDS) configured
for Remote Audit service. For more detailed information
about how to configure the z/OS server for Remote Auditing,
refer to z/OS V1R8.0-9.0 Intergrated Security Services
Enterprise Identity Mapping (EIM) Guide and Reference
(http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/FRAMESET/EIMA1140/CCONTENTS?DT=20070827115119),
chapter &quot;2.0 - Working with remote services&quot;.</p>

<p>Enable ITDS to process Remote Audit requests To enable
ITSD to process Remote Audit requests, the user ID
associated with ITDS must be granted READ access to the
IRR.AUDITX FACILITY Class profile (the profile used to
protect the R_Auditx service). This user ID can usually be
found in the STARTED Class profile for the ITDS started
procedure. If the identity associated with ITDS is ITDSUSER,
the administrator can configure RACF to grant Remote
Auditing process- ing to ITDS with the following TSO
commands:</p>

<p>TSO Commands: Grant ITDSUSER READ access to IRR.AUDITX
FACILITY Class profile rdefine FACILITY IRR.RAUDITX
uacc(none) permit IRR.RAUDITX class(FACILITY) id(ITDSUSER)
access(READ)</p>

<p>Create/enable RACF user ID to perform Remote Audit
requests A z/OS RACF user ID is needed by the plugin - Every
Audit request per- formed by the plugin will use a RACF user
ID, as configured in the plu- gin configuration
zos-remote.conf(5). This user ID needs READ access to
FACILITY Class resource IRR.LDAP.REMOTE.AUDIT. If the user
ID is BINDUSER, the administrator can configure RACF to
enable this user to perform Remote Auditing requests with
the following TSO commands:</p>

<p>TSO Commands: Enable BINDUSER to perform Remote Audit
requests rdefine FACILITY IRR.LDAP.REMOTE.AUDIT uacc(none)
permit IRR.LDAP.REMOTE.AUDIT class(FACILITY) id(BINDUSER)
access(READ)</p>

<p>Add @LINUX Class to RACF When performing remote auditing
requests, the audispd-zos-remote plugin will use the special
@LINUX CDT Class and the audit record type (eg.: SYSCALL,
AVC, PATH...) as the CDT Resource Class for all events pro-
cessed. To make sure events are logged, the RACF server must
be con- figured with a Dynamic CDT Class named @LINUX with
correct sizes and attributes. The following TSO commands can
be used to add this class:</p>

<p>TSO Commands: Add @LINUX CDT Class rdefine cdt @LINUX
cdtinfo(posit(493) FIRST(alpha,national,numeric,special)
OTHER(alpha,national,numeric,special) RACLIST(REQUIRED)
case(asis) generic(allowed) defaultuacc(none)
maxlength(246)) setr classact(cdt) setr raclist(cdt) setr
raclist(cdt) refresh setr classact(@LINUX) setr
raclist(@LINUX) setr generic(@LINUX)</p>

<p>Add profiles to the @LINUX Class Once the CDT Class has
been defined, you can add profiles to it, speci- fying
resources (wildcards allowed) to log or ignore. The
following are examples:</p>

<p>TSO Commands: Log only AVC records (One generic and one
discrete pro- file): rdefine @LINUX * uacc(none)
audit(none(read)) rdefine @LINUX AVC uacc(none)
audit(all(read)) setr raclist(@LINUX) refresh</p>

<p>TSO Commands: Log everything (One generic profile):
rdefine @LINUX * uacc(none) audit(all(read)) setr
raclist(@LINUX) refresh</p>

<p>Resources always match the single profile with the best
match.</p>

<p>There are many other ways to define logging in RACF.
Please refer to the server documentation for more
details.</p>

<p>SMF Mapping The ITDS Remote Audit service will cut SMF
records of type 83 subtype 4 everytime it processes a
request. This plugin will issue a remote audit request for
every incoming Linux Audit record (meaning that one Linux
record will map to one SMF record), and fill this types
records with the following:</p>

<p>Link Value The Linux event serial number, encoded in
network-byte order hexadeci- mal representation. Records
within the same Event share the same Link Value.</p>

<p>Violation Always zero (0) - False</p>

<p>Event Code Always two (2) - Authorization event</p>

<p>Event Qualifier Zero (0) - Success, if the event
reported success=yes or res=success, Three (3) - Fail, if
the event reported success=no or res=failed, or One (1) -
Info otherwise.</p>

<p>Class Always @LINUX</p>

<p>Resource The Linux record type for the processed record.
e.g.: SYSCALL,AVC,PATH,CWD etc.</p>

<p>Log String Textual message bringing the RACF user ID
used to perform the request, plus the Linux hostname and the
record type for the first record in the processed event.
e.g.: Remote audit request from RACFUSER. Linux (host-
name.localdomain):USER_AUTH</p>

<p>Data Field List Also known as relocates, this list will
bring all the field names and values in a fieldname=value
format, as a type 114 (Appication specific Data) relocate.
The plug-in will try to interpret those fields (i.e.: use
human-readable username root instead of numeric userid 0)
whenever possible. Currently, this plugin will also add a
relocate type 113 (Date And Time Security Event Occurred)
with the Event Timestamp in the format as returned by
ctime(3).</p>

<p>ERRORS Errors and warnings are reported to syslog (under
DAEMON facility). In situations where the event was
submitted but the z/OS server returned an error condition,
the logged message brings a name followed by a
human-readable description. Below are some common errors
conditions:</p>

<p>NOTREQ - No logging required Resource (audit record
type) is not set to be logged in the RACF server - The
@LINUX Class profile governing this audit record type is set
to ignore. See IBM z/OS RACF Server configuration</p>

<p>UNDETERMINED - Undetermined result No profile found for
specified resource. There is no @LINUX Class configured or
no @LINUX Class profile associated with this audit record
type. See IBM z/OS RACF Server configuration</p>

<p>UNAUTHORIZED - The user does not have authority the
R_auditx service The user ID associated with the ITDS doesnt
have READ access to the IRR.AUDITX FACILITY Class profile.
See IBM z/OS RACF Server configuration</p>

<p>UNSUF_AUTH - The user has unsuficient authority for the
requested func- tion The RACF user ID used to perform Remote
Audit requests (as configured in zos-remote.conf(5)) don t
have access to the IRR.LDAP.REMOTE.AUDIT FACILITY Class
profile. See IBM z/OS RACF Server configuration</p>

<p>BUGS The plugin currently does remote auditing in a
best-effort basis, and will dischard events in case the z/OS
server cannot be contacted (net- work failures) or in any
other case that event submission fails.</p>
