<p>PROCMAIL(1) PROCMAIL(1)</p>

<p>NAME procmail - autonomous mail processor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS procmail [-ptoY] [-f fromwhom] [parameter=value
| rcfile] ... procmail [-toY] [-f fromwhom] [-a argument]
... -d recipient ... procmail [-ptY] -m [parameter=value]
... rcfile [argument] ... procmail [-toY] [-a argument] -z
procmail -v</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For a quick start, see NOTES at the end.</p>

<p>Procmail should be invoked automatically over the
.forward file mecha- nism as soon as mail arrives.
Alternatively, when installed by a sys- tem administrator
(and in the standard Red Hat Linux configuration), it can be
invoked from within the mailer immediately. When invoked, it
first sets some environment variables to default values,
reads the mail message from stdin until an EOF, separates
the body from the header, and then, if no command line
arguments are present, it starts to look for a file named
$HOME/.procmailrc. According to the processing recipes in
this file, the mail message that just arrived gets dis-
tributed into the right folder (and more). If no rcfile is
found, or processing of the rcfile falls off the end,
procmail will store the mail in the default system
mailbox.</p>

<p>If no rcfiles and no -p have been specified on the
command line, proc- mail will, prior to reading
$HOME/.procmailrc, interpret commands from /etc/procmailrc
(if present). Care must be taken when creating
/etc/procmailrc, because, if circumstances permit, it will
be executed with root privileges (contrary to the
$HOME/.procmailrc file of course).</p>

<p>If running suid root or with root privileges, procmail
will be able to perform as a functionally enhanced,
backwards compatible mail delivery agent.</p>

<p>Procmail can also be used as a general purpose mail
filter, i.e., pro- visions have been made to enable procmail
to be invoked in a special sendmail rule.</p>

<p>The rcfile format is described in detail in the
procmailrc(5) man page.</p>

<p>The weighted scoring technique is described in detail in
the proc- mailsc(5) man page.</p>

<p>Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in the
procmailex(5) man page.</p>

<p>Signals TERMINATE Terminate prematurely and requeue the
mail.</p>

<p>HANGUP Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.</p>

<p>INTERRUPT Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.</p>

<p>QUIT Terminate prematurely and silently lose the
mail.</p>

<p>ALARM Force a timeout (see TIMEOUT).</p>

<p>USR1 Equivalent to a VERBOSE=off.</p>

<p>USR2 Equivalent to a VERBOSE=on.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v Procmail will print its version number,
display its compile time configuration and exit.</p>

<p>-p Preserve any old environment. Normally procmail
clears the envi- ronment upon startup, except for the value
of TZ. However, in any case: any default values will
override any preexisting environment variables, i.e.,
procmail will not pay any attention to any prede- fined
environment variables, it will happily overwrite them with
its own defaults. For the list of environment variables that
procmail will preset see the procmailrc(5) man page. If both
-p and -m are specified, the list of preset environment
variables shrinks to just: LOGNAME, HOME, SHELL, ORGMAIL and
MAILDIR.</p>

<p>-t Make procmail fail softly, i.e., if procmail cannot
deliver the mail to any of the destinations you gave, the
mail will not bounce, but will return to the mailqueue.
Another delivery- attempt will be made at some time in the
future.</p>

<p>-f fromwhom Causes procmail to regenerate the leading
From line with fromwhom as the sender (instead of -f one
could use the alternate and obsolete -r). If fromwhom
consists merely of a single -, then procmail will only
update the timestamp on the From line (if present, if not,
it will generate a new one).</p>

<p>-o Instead of allowing anyone to generate From lines,
simply over- ride the fakes.</p>

<p>-Y Assume traditional Berkeley mailbox format, ignore
any Content- Length: fields.</p>

<p>-a argument This will set $1 to be equal to argument.
Each succeeding -a argument will set the next number
variable ($2, $3, etc). It can be used to pass meta
information along to procmail. This is typi- cally done by
passing along the $@x information from the sendmail mailer
rule.</p>

<p>-d recipient ... This turns on explicit delivery mode,
delivery will be to the local user recipient. This, of
course, only is possible if proc- mail has root privileges
(or if procmail is already running with the recipients euid
and egid). Procmail will setuid to the intended recipients
and delivers the mail as if it were invoked by the recipient
with no arguments (i.e., if no rcfile is found, delivery is
like ordinary mail). This option is incompatible with
-p.</p>

<p>-m Turns procmail into a general purpose mail filter. In
this mode one rcfile must be specified on the command line.
After the rcfile, procmail will accept an unlimited number
of arguments. If the rcfile is an absolute path starting
with /etc/procmailrcs/ without backward references (i.e. the
parent directory cannot be mentioned) procmail will, only if
no security violations are found, take on the identity of
the owner of the rcfile (or sym- bolic link). For some
advanced usage of this option you should look in the
EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p>-z This turns on LMTP mode, wherein procmail acts as an
RFC2033 LMTP server. Delivery takes place in the same manner
and under the same restrictions as the delivery mode enabled
with -d. This option is incompatible with -p and -f.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Any arguments containing an = are considered
to be environment vari- able assignments, they will all be
evaluated after the default values have been assigned and
before the first rcfile is opened.</p>

<p>Any other arguments are presumed to be rcfile paths
(either absolute, or if they start with ./ relative to the
current directory; any other relative path is relative to
$HOME, unless the -m option has been given, in which case
all relative paths are relative to the current directory);
procmail will start with the first one it finds on the com-
mand line. The following ones will only be parsed if the
preceding ones have a not matching HOST-directive entry, or
in case they should not exist.</p>

<p>If no rcfiles are specified, it looks for
$HOME/.procmailrc. If not even that can be found, processing
will continue according to the default settings of the
environment variables and the ones specified on the command
line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in
the procmailex(5) man page. A small sample rcfile can be
found in the NOTES section below.</p>

<p>Skip the rest of this EXAMPLES section unless you are a
system adminis- trator who is vaguely familiar with
sendmail.cf syntax.</p>

<p>The -m option is typically used when procmail is called
from within a rule in the sendmail.cf file. In order to be
able to do this it is convenient to create an extra procmail
mailer in your sendmail.cf file (in addition to the perhaps
already present local mailer that starts up procmail). To
create such a procmail mailer I d suggest something
like:</p>

<p>Mprocmail, P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=mSDFMhun, S=11, R=21,
A=procmail -m $h $g $u</p>

<p>This enables you to use rules like the following (most
likely in rule- set 0) to filter mail through the procmail
mailer (please note the leading tab to continue the rule,
and the tab to separate the com- ments):</p>

<p>R$*&lt;@some.where&gt;$* $#procmail
$@/etc/procmailrcs/some.rc $:$1@some.where.procmail$2
R$*&lt;@$*.procmail&gt;$* $1&lt;@$2&gt;$3 Already filtered,
map back</p>

<p>And /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc could be as simple as:</p>

<p>SENDER = &quot;&lt;$1&gt;&quot; # fix for empty sender
addresses SHIFT = 1 # remove it from $@</p>

<p>:0 # sink all junk mail * ^Subject:.*junk /dev/null</p>

<p>:0 w # pass along all other mail ! -oi -f
&quot;$SENDER&quot; &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p>Do watch out when sending mail from within the
/etc/procmailrcs/some.rc file, if you send mail to addresses
which match the first rule again, you could be creating an
endless mail loop.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd to set the recipients LOGNAME, HOME
and SHELL variable defaults</p>

<p>/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME system mailbox; both the system
mailbox and the immediate directory it is in will be created
every time procmail starts and either one is not present</p>

$DEFAULT equals /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME and procmail is
deliv- ering to $DEFAULT)</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Autoforwarding mailbox found The system
mailbox had its suid or sgid bit set, procmail terminates
with EX_NOUSER assuming that this mailbox must not be
delivered to.</p>

<p>Bad substitution of &quot;x&quot; Not a valid
environment variable name specified.</p>

<p>Closing brace unexpected There was no corresponding
opening brace (nest- ing block).</p>

<p>Conflicting options Not all option combinations are
useful</p>

<p>Conflicting x suppressed Flag x is not compatible with
some other flag on this recipe.</p>

<p>Couldnt create &quot;x&quot; The system mailbox was
missing and could not/will not be created.</p>

<p>Couldnt create maildir part &quot;x&quot; The maildir
folder &quot;x&quot; is missing one or more required
subdirectories and procmail could not create them.</p>

<p>Couldnt create or rename temp file &quot;x&quot; An
error occurred in the mechanics of deliver- ing to the
directory folder &quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p>Couldnt determine implicit lockfile from &quot;x&quot;
There were no &gt;&gt; redirectors to be found, us- ing
simply $LOCKEXT as locallockfile.</p>

<p>Couldnt read &quot;x&quot; Procmail was unable to open
an rcfile or it was not a regular file, or procmail couldnt
open an MH directory to find the highest numbered file.</p>

<p>Couldn t unlock &quot;x&quot; Lockfile was already gone,
or write permission to the directory where the lockfile is
has been denied.</p>

<p>Deadlock attempted on &quot;x&quot; The locallockfile
specified on this recipe is equal to a still active
$LOCKFILE.</p>

<p>Denying special privileges for &quot;x&quot; Procmail
will not take on the identity that comes with the rcfile
because a security viola- tion was found (e.g. -p or
variable assignments on the command line) or procmail had
insuffi- cient privileges to do so.</p>

<p>Descriptor &quot;x&quot; was not open As procmail was
started, stdin, stdout or stderr was not connected (possibly
an attempt to sub- vert security)</p>

<p>Enforcing stricter permissions on &quot;x&quot; The
system mailbox of the recipient was found to be unsecured,
procmail secured it.</p>

<p>Error while writing to &quot;x&quot; Nonexistent
subdirectory, no write permission, pipe died or disk
full.</p>

<p>Exceeded LINEBUF Buffer overflow detected, LINEBUF was
too small, PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been set.</p>

<p>MAILDIR is not an absolute path</p>

<p>MAILDIR path too long</p>

<p>ORGMAIL is not an absolute path</p>

<p>ORGMAIL path too long</p>

<p>default rcfile is not an absolute path</p>

<p>default rcfile path too long The specified item s full
path, when expanded, was longer than LINEBUF or didn t start
with a file separator.</p>

<p>Excessive output quenched from &quot;x&quot; The program
or filter &quot;x&quot; tried to produce too much output for
the current LINEBUF, the rest was discarded and
PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been set.</p>

<p>Extraneous x ignored The action line or other flags on
this recipe makes flag x meaningless.</p>

<p>Failed forking &quot;x&quot; Process table is full (and
NORESRETRY has been exhausted).</p>

<p>Failed to execute &quot;x&quot; Program not in path, or
not executable.</p>

<p>Forced unlock denied on &quot;x&quot; No write
permission in the directory where lock- file &quot;x&quot;
resides, or more than one procmail try- ing to force a lock
at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>Forcing lock on &quot;x&quot; Lockfile &quot;x&quot; is
going to be removed by force be- cause of a timeout (see
also: LOCKTIMEOUT).</p>

<p>Incomplete recipe The start of a recipe was found, but
it stranded in an EOF.</p>

<p>Insufficient privileges Procmail either needs root
privileges, or must have the right (e)uid and (e)gid to run
in de- livery mode. The mail will bounce.</p>

<p>Invalid regexp &quot;x&quot; The regular expression
&quot;x&quot; contains errors (most likely some missing or
extraneous parens).</p>

<p>Kernel-lock failed While trying to use the
kernel-supported locking calls, one of them failed (usually
indicates an OS error), procmail ignores this error and pro-
ceeds.</p>

<p>Kernel-unlock failed See above.</p>

<p>Lock failure on &quot;x&quot; Can only occur if you
specify some real weird (and illegal) lockfilenames or if
the lockfile could not be created because of insufficient
permissions or nonexistent subdirectories.</p>

<p>Lost &quot;x&quot; Procmail tried to clone itself but
could not find back rcfile &quot;x&quot; (it either got
removed or it was a relative path and you changed directory
since procmail opened it last time).</p>

<p>Missing action The current recipe was found to be
incomplete.</p>

<p>Missing closing brace A nesting block was started, but
never finished.</p>

<p>Missing name The -f option needs an extra argument.</p>

<p>Missing argument You specified the -a option but forgot
the argu- ment.</p>

<p>Missing rcfile You specified the -m option, procmail
expects the name of an rcfile as argument.</p>

<p>Missing recipient You specified the -d option or called
procmail under a different name, it expects one or more
recipients as arguments.</p>

<p>No space left to finish writing &quot;x&quot; The
filesystem containing &quot;x&quot; does not have enough
free space to permit delivery of the mes- sage to the
file.</p>

<p>Out of memory The system is out of swap space (and
NORESRETRY has been exhausted).</p>

<p>Processing continued The unrecognised options on the
command line are ignored, proceeding as usual.</p>

<p>Program failure (nnn) of &quot;x&quot; Program that was
started by procmail returned nnn instead of EXIT_SUCCESS
(=0); if nnn is neg- ative, then this is the signal the
program died on.</p>

<p>Quota exceeded while writing &quot;x&quot; The filesize
quota for the recipient on the filesystem containing
&quot;x&quot; does not permit deliv- ering the message to
the file.</p>

<p>Renaming bogus &quot;x&quot; into &quot;x&quot; The
system mailbox of the recipient was found to be bogus,
procmail performed evasive actions.</p>

<p>Rescue of unfiltered data succeeded/failed A filter
returned unsuccessfully, procmail tried to get back the
original text.</p>

<p>Skipped: &quot;x&quot; Couldnt do anything with
&quot;x&quot; in the rcfile (syntax error), ignoring it.</p>

<p>Suspicious rcfile &quot;x&quot; The owner of the rcfile
was not the recipient or root, the file was world writable,
or the direc- tory that contained it was world writable, or
this was the default rcfile ($HOME/.procmailrc) and either
it was group writable or the directo- ry that contained it
was group writable (the rc- file was not used).</p>

<p>Terminating prematurely whilst waiting for ... Procmail
received a signal while it was waiting for ...</p>

<p>Timeout, terminating &quot;x&quot; Timeout has occurred
on program or filter &quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p>Timeout, was waiting for &quot;x&quot; Timeout has
occurred on program, filter or file &quot;x&quot;. If it was
a program or filter, then it didnt seem to be running
anymore.</p>

<p>Truncated file to former size The file could not be
delivered to successfully, so the file was truncated to its
former size.</p>

<p>Truncating &quot;x&quot; and retrying lock &quot;x&quot;
does not seem to be a valid filename or the file is not
empty.</p>

<p>Unable to treat as directory &quot;x&quot; Either the
suffix on &quot;x&quot; would indicate that it should be an
MH or maildir folder, or it was listed as an second folder
into which to link, but it already exists and is not a
directory.</p>

<p>Unexpected EOL Missing closing quote, or trying to
escape EOF.</p>

<p>Unknown user &quot;x&quot; The specified recipient does
not have a corre- sponding uid.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DIAGNOSTICS Extended diagnostics can be turned
on and off through setting the VER- BOSE variable.</p>

<p>[pid] time &amp; date Procmail s pid and a timestamp.
Generated when- ever procmail logs a diagnostic and at least
a second has elapsed since the last timestamp.</p>

<p>Acquiring kernel-lock Procmail now tries to kernel-lock
the most re- cently opened file (descriptor).</p>

<p>Assigning &quot;x&quot; Environment variable
assignment.</p>

<p>Assuming identity of the recipient, VERBOSE=off Dropping
all privileges (if any), implicitly turns off extended
diagnostics.</p>

<p>Bypassed locking &quot;x&quot; The mail spool directory
was not accessible to procmail, it relied solely on kernel
locks.</p>

<p>Executing &quot;x&quot; Starting program &quot;x&quot;.
If it is started by proc- mail directly (without an
intermediate shell), procmail will show where it separated
the argu- ments by inserting commas.</p>

<p>HOST mismatched &quot;x&quot; This host was called
&quot;x&quot;, HOST contained some- thing else.</p>

<p>Locking &quot;x&quot; Creating lockfile
&quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p>Linking to &quot;x&quot; Creating a hardlink between
directory folders.</p>

<p>Match on &quot;x&quot; Condition matched.</p>

<p>Matched &quot;x&quot; Assigned &quot;x&quot; to
MATCH.</p>

<p>No match on &quot;x&quot; Condition didn t match, recipe
skipped.</p>

<p>Non-zero exitcode (nnn) by &quot;x&quot; Program that
was started by procmail as a condi- tion or as the action of
a recipe with the W flag returned nnn instead of
EXIT_SUCCESS (=0); the usage indicates that this is not an
entirely unexpected condition.</p>

<p>Notified comsat: &quot;$LOGNAME@offset:file&quot; Sent
comsat/biff a notice that mail arrived for user $LOGNAME at
offset in file.</p>

<p>Opening &quot;x&quot; Opening file &quot;x&quot; for
appending.</p>

<p>Rcfile: &quot;x&quot; Rcfile changed to
&quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p>Reiterating kernel-lock While attempting several locking
methods, one of these failed. Procmail will reiterate until
they all succeed in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Score: added newtotal &quot;x&quot; This condition
scored added points, which re- sulted in a newtotal
score.</p>

<p>Unlocking &quot;x&quot; Removing lockfile &quot;x&quot;
again.</p>

<p>WARNINGS You should create a shell script that uses
lockfile(1) before invoking your mail shell on any mailbox
file other than the system mailbox (un- less of course, your
mail shell uses the same lockfiles (local or glob- al) you
specified in your rcfile).</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that you absolutely need to kill
procmail before it has finished, first try and use the
regular kill command (i.e., not kill -9, see the subsection
Signals for suggestions), otherwise some lockfiles might not
get removed.</p>

<p>Beware when using the -t option, if procmail repeatedly
is unable to deliver the mail (e.g., due to an incorrect
rcfile), the system mailqueue could fill up. This could
aggravate both the local postmas- ter and other users.</p>

<p>The /etc/procmailrc file might be executed with root
privileges, so be very careful of what you put in it. SHELL
will be equal to that of the current recipient, so if
procmail has to invoke the shell, youd better set it to some
safe value first. See also: DROPPRIVS.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if chown(1) is permitted on files in
/etc/procmail- rcs/, that they can be chowned to root (or
anyone else) by their cur- rent owners. For maximum
security, make sure this directory is exe- cutable to root
only.</p>

<p>Procmail is not the proper tool for sharing one mailbox
among many users, such as when you have one POP account for
all mail to your do- main. It can be done if you manage to
configure your MTA to add some headers with the envelope
recipient data in order to tell Procmail who a message is
for, but this is usually not the right thing to do. Per-
haps you want to investigate if your MTA offers virtual user
tables, or check out the multidrop facility of
Fetchmail.</p>

<p>BUGS After removing a lockfile by force, procmail waits
$SUSPEND seconds be- fore creating a new lockfile so that
another process that decides to remove the stale lockfile
will not remove the newly created lock by mistake.</p>

<p>Procmail uses the regular TERMINATE signal to terminate
any runaway filter, but it does not check if the filter
responds to that signal and it only sends it to the filter
itself, not to any of the filters chil- dren.</p>

<p>A continued Content-Length: field is not handled
correctly.</p>

<p>The embedded newlines in a continued header should be
skipped when matching instead of being treated as a single
space as they are now.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS If there is an existing Content-Length:
field in the header of the mail and the -Y option is not
specified, procmail will trim the field to re- port the
correct size. Procmail does not change the fieldwidth.</p>

<p>If there is no Content-Length: field or the -Y option
has been speci- fied and procmail appends to regular
mailfolders, any lines in the body of the message that look
like postmarks are prepended with &gt; (disarms bogus
mailheaders). The regular expression that is used to search
for these postmarks is: 0rom</p>

<p>If the destination name used in explicit delivery mode
is not in /etc/passwd, procmail will proceed as if explicit
delivery mode was not in effect. If not in explicit delivery
mode and should the uid proc- mail is running under, have no
corresponding /etc/passwd entry, then HOME will default to
/, LOGNAME will default to #uid, SHELL will de- fault to
/bin/sh, and ORGMAIL will default to /tmp/dead.letter.</p>

<p>When in explicit delivery mode, procmail will generate a
leading From line if none is present. If one is already
present procmail will leave it intact. If procmail is not
invoked with one of the following user or group ids : root,
daemon, uucp, mail, x400, network, list, slist, lists or
news, but still has to generate or accept a new From line,
it will generate an additional &gt;From line to help
distinguish fake mails.</p>

<p>For security reasons procmail will only use an absolute
or $HOME-rela- tive rcfile if it is owned by the recipient
or root, not world writable, and the directory it is
contained in is not world writable. The $HOME/.procmailrc
file has the additional constraint of not being
group-writable or in a group-writable directory.</p>

<p>If /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME is a bogus mailbox (i.e.,
does not belong to the recipient, is unwritable, is a
symbolic link or is a hard link), procmail will upon startup
try to rename it into a file starting with BOGUS.$LOGNAME.
and ending in an inode-sequence-code. If this turns out to
be impossible, ORGMAIL will have no initial value, and hence
will inhibit delivery without a proper rcfile.</p>

<p>If /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME already is a valid mailbox,
but has got too loose permissions on it, procmail will
correct this. To prevent proc- mail from doing this make
sure the u+x bit is set.</p>

<p>When delivering to directories, MH folders, or maildir
folders, you don t need to use lockfiles to prevent several
concurrently running procmail programs from messing up.</p>

<p>Delivering to MH folders is slightly more time consuming
than deliver- ing to normal directories or mailboxes,
because procmail has to search for the next available number
(instead of having the filename immedi- ately
available).</p>

<p>On general failure procmail will return EX_CANTCREAT,
unless option -t is specified, in which case it will return
EX_TEMPFAIL.</p>

<p>To make egrepping of headers more consistent, procmail
concatenates all continued header fields; but only
internally. When delivering the mail, line breaks will
appear as before.</p>

<p>If procmail is called under a name not starting with
procmail (e.g., if it is linked to another name and invoked
as such), it comes up in explicit delivery mode, and expects
the recipients names as command line arguments (as if -d had
been specified).</p>

<p>Comsat/biff notifications are done using udp. They are
sent off once when procmail generates the regular logfile
entry. The notification messages have the following extended
format (or as close as you can get when final delivery was
not to a file):
$LOGNAME@offset_of_message_in_mailbox:absolute_path_to_mailbox</p>

<p>Whenever procmail itself opens a file to deliver to, it
consistently uses the following kernel locking strategies:
fcntl(2).</p>

<p>Procmail is NFS-resistant and eight-bit clean.</p>

<p>NOTES Calling up procmail with the -h or -? options will
cause it to display a command-line help and recipe flag
quick-reference page.</p>

<p>There exists an excellent newbie FAQ about mailfilters
(and procmail in particular); it is maintained by Nancy
McGough &lt;nancym@ii.com&gt; and can be obtained by sending
a mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the fol- lowing in
the body: send usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq</p>

<p>If procmail is not installed globally as the default
mail delivery agent (ask your system administrator), you
have to make sure it is in- voked when your mail arrives. In
this case your $HOME/.forward (be- ware, it has to be world
readable) file should contain the line below. Be sure to
include the single and double quotes, and unless you know
your site to be running smrsh (the SendMail Restricted
SHell), it must be an absolute path.</p>

<p>&quot;|exec /usr/bin/procmail&quot;</p>

<p>Some mailers (notably exim) do not currently accept the
above syntax. In such case use this instead:</p>

<p>|/usr/bin/procmail</p>

<p>Procmail can also be invoked to postprocess an already
filled system mailbox. This can be useful if you dont want
to or cant use a $HOME/.forward file (in which case the
following script could periodi- cally be called from within
cron(1), or whenever you start reading mail):</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh</p>

<p>ORGMAIL=/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME</p>

<p>if cd $HOME &amp;&amp; test -s $ORGMAIL &amp;&amp;
lockfile -r0 -l1024 .newmail.lock 2&gt;/dev/null then trap
&quot;rm -f .newmail.lock&quot; 1 2 3 13 15 umask 077
lockfile -l1024 -ml cat $ORGMAIL &gt;&gt;.newmail &amp;&amp;
cat /dev/null &gt;$ORGMAIL lockfile -mu formail -s procmail
&lt;.newmail &amp;&amp; rm -f .newmail rm -f .newmail.lock
