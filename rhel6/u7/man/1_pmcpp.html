<p>NAME pmcpp - simple preprocessor for the Performance
Co-Pilot</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmcpp [-D name[=value] ...] [infile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmcpp provides a very simple pre-processor
for manipulating Performance Metric Name Space (PMNS) files
for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP). It is most commonly used
internally to process the PMNS file(s) after
pmLoadNameSpace(3) or pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3) is called.</p>

<p>Input lines are read from infile (or standard input if
infile is not specified), processed and written to standard
output.</p>

<p>All C-style comments of the form /* ... */ are stripped
from the input stream.</p>

<p>There are no predefined macros for pmcpp although macros
may be defined on the command line using the -D option,
where name and value must fol- low the same rules as
described below for the #define directive.</p>

<p>pmcpp accepts the following directives in the input
stream (like cpp(1)):</p>

<p>* #include &quot;filename&quot; or #include
&lt;filename&gt; In either case the directory search path
for filename tries filename first, then the directory for
the command line infile (if any), fol- lowed by the
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns directory. #include directives may be
nested, up to a maximum depth of 5.</p>

<p>* #define name value Defines a value for the macro name
which must be a valid C-style name, so leading alphabetic or
_ followed by zero or more alphanumerics or _. value is
optional (and defaults to an empty value) but when present
it may not contain white space and quoting or escaping is
not supported.</p>

<p>* #undef name Removes the macro definition, if any, for
name.</p>

<p>* #ifdef name ... #endif or #ifndef name ... #endif The
enclosing lines will be stripped or included, depending if
the macro name is defined or not.</p>

<p>Macro substitution is achieved by breaking the input
stream into words separated by white space or one of the
characters . or : - this matches the syntax of the PMNS, see
pmns(5). Each word is checked and if it matches a macro
name, the word is replaced by the macro value, otherwise the
word is unchanged.</p>

<p>There is generally one output line for each input line,
although the line may be empty if the text has been stripped
due to the handling of comments or conditional directives.
When there is a change in the input stream, an additional
output line is generated of the form:</p>

<p># line &quot;name&quot;</p>

<p>to indicate the following line of output corresponds to
line number line of the input file name.</p>

<p>Important cpp(1) features that are not supported by
pmcpp include:</p>

<p>* #if expr ... #endif</p>

<p>* Nested use of #ifdef or #ifndef.</p>

<p>* #else within an #ifdef or #ifndef.</p>

<p>* Stripping C++ style comments, as in // comment</p>

<p>* Error recovery - the first error encountered by pmcpp
will be fatal.</p>

<p>* cpp(1) command line options like -U , -P and -I.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

pmLoadNameSpace(3), pmns(5), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>
