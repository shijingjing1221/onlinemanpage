<p>NAME rrdgraph_examples - Examples for rrdtool graph</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rrdtool graph /home/httpd/html/test.png
--img-format PNG</p>

<p>followed by any of the examples below</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For your convenience some of the commands
are explained here by using detailed examples. They are not
always cut-and-paste ready because comments are intermixed
with the examples.</p>

columns</p>

GPRINT:ds1pct:&quot;%6.2lf %Sbps Offsetting a line on the
y-axis Depending on your needs you can do this in two
ways:</p>

<p>&middot; Offset the data, then graph this</p>

<p>DEF:mydata=my.rrd:ds:AVERAGE</p>

<p>Note: this will also influence any other command that
uses &quot;data&quot;</p>

<p>CDEF:data=mydata,100,+ LINE1:data#FF0000:&quot;Data with
offset&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Graph the original data, with an offset</p>

<p>DEF:mydata=my.rrd:ds:AVERAGE</p>

<p>Note: no color in the first line so it is not
visible</p>

<p>LINE1:100</p>

<p>Note: the second line gets stacked on top of the first
one</p>

<p>LINE1:data#FF0000:&quot;Data with offset&quot;:STACK</p>

<p>Drawing dashed lines Also works for HRULE and VRULE</p>

<p>&middot; default style: - - - - -
LINE1:data#FF0000:&quot;dashed line&quot;:dashes</p>

<p>&middot; more fancy style with offset: - - --- - --- -
LINE1:data#FF0000:&quot;another dashed
line&quot;:dashes=15,5,5,10:dash-offset=10</p>

<p>Time ranges Last four weeks: --start end-4w --end 00:00
January 2001: --start 20010101 --end start+31d January 2001:
--start 20010101 --end 20010201 Last hour: --start end-1h
Last 24 hours: &lt;nothing at all&gt; Yesterday: --end
00:00</p>

<p>Viewing the current and previous week together --end now
--start end-1w DEF:thisweek=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE
DEF:lastweek=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:end=now-1w:start=end-1w</p>

<p>Shift the data forward by one week (604800 seconds)</p>

<p>SHIFT:lastweek:604800 [ more of the usual VDEF and CDEF
stuff if you like ] AREA:lastweek#0000FF:Last week
LINE1:thisweek#FF0000:This week</p>

<p>Aberrant Behaviour Detection If the specialized function
RRAs exist for aberrant behavior detection, they can be used
to generate the graph of a time series with confidence bands
and failures.</p>

<p>rrdtool graph example.png
DEF:obs=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:AVERAGE
DEF:pred=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:HWPREDICT
DEF:dev=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:DEVPREDICT
DEF:fail=monitor.rrd:ifOutOctets:FAILURES
TICK:fail#ffffa0:1.0:&quot;Failures Average bits out&quot;
CDEF:scaledobs=obs,8,* CDEF:upper=pred,dev,2,*,+
CDEF:lower=pred,dev,2,*,- CDEF:scaledupper=upper,8,*
CDEF:scaledlower=lower,8,*
LINE2:scaledobs#0000ff:&quot;Average bits out&quot;
LINE1:scaledupper#ff0000:&quot;Upper Confidence Bound:
Average bits out&quot; LINE1:scaledlower#ff0000:&quot;Lower
Confidence Bound: Average bits out&quot;</p>

<p>This example generates a graph of the data series in
blue (LINE2 with the scaledobs virtual data source),
confidence bounds in red (scaledupper and scaledlower
virtual data sources), and potential failures (i.e.
potential aberrant aberrant behavior) marked by vertical
yellow lines (the fail data source).</p>

<p>The raw data comes from an AVERAGE RRA, the finest
resolution of the observed time series (one consolidated
data point per primary data point). The predicted (or
smoothed) values are stored in the HWPREDICT RRA. The
predicted deviations (think standard deviation) values are
stored in the DEVPREDICT RRA. Finally, the FAILURES RRA
contains indicators, with 1 denoting a potential
failure.</p>

<p>All of the data is rescaled to bits (instead of Octets)
by multiplying by 8. The confidence bounds are computed by
an offset of 2 deviations both above and below the predicted
values (the CDEFs upper and lower). Vertical lines indicated
potential failures are graphed via the TICK graph element,
which converts non-zero values in an RRA into tick marks.
Here an axis-fraction argument of 1.0 means the tick marks
span the entire y-axis, and hence become vertical lines on
the graph.</p>

<p>The choice of 2 deviations (a scaling factor) matches
the default used internally by the FAILURES RRA. If the
internal value is changed (see rrdtune), this graphing
command should be changed to be consistent.</p>

<p>A note on data reduction:</p>

<p>The rrdtool graph command is designed to plot data at a
specified temporal resolution, regardless of the actually
resolution of the data in the RRD file. This can present a
problem for the specialized consolidation functions which
maintain a one-to-one mapping between primary data points
and consolidated data points. If a graph insists on viewing
the contents of these RRAs on a coarser temporal scale, the
graph command tries to do something intelligent, but the
confidence bands and failures no longer have the same
meaning and may be misleading.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rrdgraph gives an overview of how rrdtool graph
works. rrdgraph_data describes DEF,CDEF and VDEF in detail.
rrdgraph_rpn describes the RPN language used in the xDEF
statements. rrdgraph_graph page describes all the graph and
print functions.</p>
