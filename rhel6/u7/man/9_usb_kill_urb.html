<p>USB_KILL_URB(9) USB Core APIs USB_KILL_URB(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_kill_urb - cancel a transfer request and wait
for it to finish</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void usb_kill_urb(struct urb * urb);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS urb pointer to URB describing a previously
submitted request, may be NULL</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This routine cancels an in-progress request.
It is guaranteed that upon return all completion handlers
will have finished and the URB will be totally idle and
available for reuse. These features make this an ideal way
to stop I/O in a disconnect callback or close function. If
the request has not already finished or been unlinked the
completion handler will see urb-&gt;status == -ENOENT.</p>

<p>While the routine is running, attempts to resubmit the
URB will fail with error -EPERM. Thus even if the
URB&acute;s completion handler always tries to resubmit, it
will not succeed and the URB will become idle.</p>

<p>This routine may not be used in an interrupt context
(such as a bottom half or a completion handler), or when
holding a spinlock, or in other situations where the caller
can&acute;t schedule.</p>

<p>This routine should not be called by a driver after its
disconnect method has returned.</p>
