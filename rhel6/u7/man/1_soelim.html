<p>NAME soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS soelim [ -Cv ] [ -Idir ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between the -I command
line option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION soelim reads files and replaces lines of the
form</p>

<p>.so file</p>

<p>by the contents of file. It is useful if files included
with so need to be preprocessed. Normally, soelim should be
invoked with the -s option of groff.</p>

<p>Note that there must be no whitespace between the
leading dot and the two characters s and o . Otherwise, only
groff interprets the .so request (and soelim ignores
it).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C Recognize .so even when followed by a
character other than space or newline.</p>

<p>-Idir This option may be used to specify a directory to
search for files (both those on the command line and those
named in .so lines). The current directory is always
searched first. This option may be specified more than once,
the directories will be searched in the order specified. No
directory search is per- formed for files specified using an
absolute path.</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>
