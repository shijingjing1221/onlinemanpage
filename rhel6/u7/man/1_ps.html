<p>PS(1) Linux User s Manual PS(1)</p>

<p>NAME ps - report a snapshot of the current
processes.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ps [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ps displays information about a selection of
the active processes. If you want a repetitive update of the
selection and the displayed information, use top(1)
instead.</p>

<p>This version of ps accepts several kinds of options: 1
UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a
dash. 2 BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be
used with a dash. 3 GNU long options, which are preceded by
two dashes.</p>

<p>Options of different types may be freely mixed, but
conflicts can appear. There are some synonymous options,
which are functionally identical, due to the many standards
and ps implementations that this ps is compatible with.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;ps -aux&quot; is distinct from &quot;ps
aux&quot;. The POSIX and UNIX standards require that
&quot;ps -aux&quot; print all processes owned by a user
named &quot;x&quot;, as well as printing all processes that
would be selected by the -a option. If the user named
&quot;x&quot; does not exist, this ps may interpret the
command as &quot;ps aux&quot; instead and print a warning.
This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old
scripts and habits. It is fragile, subject to change, and
thus should not be relied upon.</p>

<p>By default, ps selects all processes with the same
effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and
associated with the same terminal as the invoker. It
displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated
with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in
[dd-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name
(ucmd=CMD). Output is unsorted by default.</p>

<p>The use of BSD-style options will add process state
(stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args
(args=COMMAND) instead of the executable name. You can
override this with the PS_FORMAT environment variable. The
use of BSD-style options will also change the process
selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs)
that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as
setting the selection to be the set of all processes
filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on
a terminal. These effects are not considered when options
are described as being &quot;identical&quot; below, so -M
will be considered identical to Z and so on.</p>

<p>Except as described below, process selection options are
additive. The default selection is discarded, and then the
selected processes are added to the set of processes to be
displayed. A process will thus be shown if it meets any of
the given selection criteria.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see every process on the system using
standard syntax: ps -e ps -ef ps -eF ps -ely</p>

<p>To see every process on the system using BSD syntax: ps
ax ps axu</p>

<p>To print a process tree: ps -ejH ps axjf</p>

<p>To get info about threads: ps -eLf ps axms</p>

<p>To get security info: ps -eo
euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label ps axZ ps -eM</p>

<p>To see every process running as root (real &amp;
effective ID) in user format: ps -U root -u root u</p>

<p>To see every process with a user-defined format: ps -eo
pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm ps
axo stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm ps
-eopid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan</p>

<p>Print only the process IDs of syslogd: ps -C syslogd -o
pid=</p>

<p>Print only the name of PID 42: ps -q 42 -o comm=</p>

<p>SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION -A Select all processes.
Identical to -e.</p>

<p>-N Select all processes except those that fulfill the
specified conditions. (negates the selection) Identical to
--deselect.</p>

<p>T Select all processes associated with this terminal.
Identical to the t option without any argument.</p>

<p>-a Select all processes except both session leaders (see
getsid(2)) and processes not associated with a terminal.</p>

<p>a Lift the BSD-style &quot;only yourself&quot;
restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes
when some BSD-style (without &quot;-&quot;) options are used
or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like. The set of
processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set
of processes selected by other means. An alternate
description is that this option causes ps to list all
processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all processes
when used together with the x option.</p>

<p>-d Select all processes except session leaders.</p>

<p>-e Select all processes. Identical to -A.</p>

<p>g Really all, even session leaders. This flag is
obsolete and may be discontinued in a future release. It is
normally implied by the a flag, and is only useful when
operating in the sunos4 personality.</p>

<p>r Restrict the selection to only running processes.</p>

<p>x Lift the BSD-style &quot;must have a tty&quot;
restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes
when some BSD-style (without &quot;-&quot;) options are used
or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like. The set of
processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set
of processes selected by other means. An alternate
description is that this option causes ps to list all
processes owned by you (same EUID as ps), or to list all
processes when used together with the a option.</p>

<p>--deselect Select all processes except those that
fulfill the specified conditions. (negates the selection)
Identical to -N.</p>

<p>PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST These options accept a single
argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated
list. They can be used multiple times. For example: ps -p
&quot;1 2&quot; -p 3,4</p>

<p>-C cmdlist Select by command name. This selects the
processes whose executable name is given in cmdlist.</p>

<p>-G grplist Select by real group ID (RGID) or name. This
selects the processes whose real group name or ID is in the
grplist list. The real group ID identifies the group of the
user who created the process, see getgid(2).</p>

<p>U userlist Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.
This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID
is in userlist. The effective user ID describes the user
whose file access permissions are used by the process (see
geteuid(2)). Identical to -u and --user.</p>

<p>-U userlist select by real user ID (RUID) or name. It
selects the processes whose real user name or ID is in the
userlist list. The real user ID identifies the user who
created the process, see getuid(2).</p>

<p>-g grplist Select by session OR by effective group name.
Selection by session is specified by many standards, but
selection by effective group is the logical behavior that
several other operating systems use. This ps will select by
session when the list is completely numeric (as sessions
are). Group ID numbers will work only when some group names
are also specified. See the -s and --group options.</p>

<p>p pidlist Select by process ID. Identical to -p and
--pid.</p>

<p>-p pidlist Select by PID. This selects the processes
whose process ID numbers appear in pidlist. Identical to p
and --pid.</p>

<p>q pidlist Quick select by process ID. Identical to -q
and --quick-pid.</p>

<p>-q pidlist Quick select by PID. This selects the
processes whose process ID numbers appear in pidlist. With
this option ps reads the necessary info only for the pids
listed in the pidlist and doesn t apply additional filtering
rules. The order of pids is unsorted and preserved. No
additional selection options, sorting and forest type
listings are allowed in this mode. Identical to q and
--quick-pid.</p>

<p>-s sesslist Select by session ID. This selects the
processes with a session ID specified in sesslist.</p>

<p>t ttylist Select by tty. Nearly identical to -t and
--tty, but can also be used with an empty ttylist to
indicate the terminal associated with ps. Using the T option
is considered cleaner than using T with an empty
ttylist.</p>

<p>-t ttylist Select by tty. This selects the processes
associated with the terminals given in ttylist. Terminals
(ttys, or screens for text output) can be specified in
several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1. A plain &quot;-&quot;
may be used to select processes not attached to any
terminal.</p>

<p>-u userlist Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.
This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID
is in userlist. The effective user ID describes the user
whose file access permissions are used by the process (see
geteuid(2)). Identical to U and --user.</p>

<p>--Group grplist Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.
Identical to -G.</p>

<p>--User userlist Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.
Identical to -U.</p>

<p>--group grplist Select by effective group ID (EGID) or
name. This selects the processes whose effective group name
or ID is in grouplist. The effective group ID describes the
group whose file access permissions are used by the process
(see geteuid(2)). The -g option is often an alternative to
--group.</p>

<p>--pid pidlist Select by process ID. Identical to -p and
p.</p>

<p>--ppid pidlist Select by parent process ID. This selects
the processes with a parent process ID in pidlist. That is,
it selects processes that are children of those listed in
pidlist.</p>

<p>--quick-pid pidlist Quick select by process ID.
Identical to -q and q.</p>

<p>--sid sesslist Select by session ID. Identical to
-s.</p>

<p>--tty ttylist Select by terminal. Identical to -t and
t.</p>

<p>--user userlist Select by effective user ID (EUID) or
name. Identical to -u and U.</p>

<p>-123 Identical to --sid 123.</p>

<p>123 Identical to --pid 123.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL These options are used to choose
the information displayed by ps. The output may differ by
personality.</p>

<p>-F extra full format. See the -f option, which -F
implies.</p>

<p>-O format is like -o, but preloaded with some default
columns. Identical to -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command
or -o pid,format,tname,time,cmd, see -o below.</p>

<p>O format is preloaded o (overloaded). The BSD O option
can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common
fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this
option. To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
(sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other
way (e.g. with -O or --sort). When used as a formatting
option, it is identical to -O, with the BSD personality.</p>

<p>-M Add a column of security data. Identical to Z. (for
SE Linux)</p>

<p>X Register format.</p>

<p>Z Add a column of security data. Identical to -M. (for
SE Linux)</p>

<p>-c Show different scheduler information for the -l
option.</p>

<p>-f does full-format listing. This option can be combined
with many other UNIX-style options to add additional
columns. It also causes the command arguments to be printed.
When used with -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP
(thread ID) columns will be added. See the c option, the
format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.</p>

<p>j BSD job control format.</p>

<p>-j jobs format</p>

<p>l display BSD long format.</p>

<p>-l long format. The -y option is often useful with
this.</p>

<p>o format specify user-defined format. Identical to -o
and --format.</p>

<p>-o format user-defined format. format is a single
argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated
list, which offers a way to specify individual output
columns. The recognized keywords are described in the
STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section below. Headers may be
renamed (ps -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as
desired. If all column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o
comm=) then the header line will not be output. Column width
will increase as needed for wide headers; this may be used
to widen up columns such as WCHAN (ps -o
pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm). Explicit width control
(ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is offered too. The behavior of ps -o
pid=X,comm=Y varies with personality; output may be one
column named &quot;X,comm=Y&quot; or two columns named
&quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Use multiple -o options
when in doubt. Use the PS_FORMAT environment variable to
specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros
that may be used to choose the default UNIX or BSD
columns.</p>

<p>s display signal format</p>

<p>u display user-oriented format</p>

<p>v display virtual memory format</p>

<p>-y Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr. This
option can only be used with -l.</p>

<p>-Z display security context format (SELinux, etc.)</p>

<p>--format format user-defined format. Identical to -o and
o.</p>

<p>--context Display security context format. (for SE
Linux)</p>

<p>OUTPUT MODIFIERS -H show process hierarchy (forest)</p>

<p>N namelist Specify namelist file. Identical to -n, see
-n above.</p>

<p>O order Sorting order. (overloaded) The BSD O option can
act like -O (user-defined output format with some common
fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this
option. To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
(sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other
way (e.g. with -O or --sort).</p>

<p>For sorting, obsolete BSD O option syntax is
O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]]. It orders the processes listing
according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence
of one-letter short keys k1, k2, ... described in the
OBSOLETE SORT KEYS section below. The &quot;+&quot; is
currently optional, merely re-iterating the default
direction on a key, but may help to distinguish an O sort
from an O format. The &quot;-&quot; reverses direction only
on the key it precedes.</p>

<p>S Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead
child processes into their parent. This is useful for
examining a system where a parent process repeatedly forks
off short-lived children to do work.</p>

<p>c Show the true command name. This is derived from the
name of the executable file, rather than from the argv
value. Command arguments and any modifications to them (see
setproctitle(3)) are thus not shown. This option effectively
turns the args format keyword into the comm format keyword;
it is useful with the -f format option and with the various
BSD-style format options, which all normally display the
command arguments. See the -f option, the format keyword
args, and the format keyword comm.</p>

<p>e Show the environment after the command.</p>

<p>f ASCII-art process hierarchy (forest)</p>

<p>h No header. (or, one header per screen in the BSD
personality) The h option is problematic. Standard BSD ps
uses this option to print a header on each page of output,
but older Linux ps uses this option to totally disable the
header. This version of ps follows the Linux usage of not
printing the header unless the BSD personality has been
selected, in which case it prints a header on each page of
output. Regardless of the current personality, you can use
the long options --headers and --no-headers to enable
printing headers each page or disable headers entirely,
respectively.</p>

<p>k spec specify sorting order. Sorting syntax is
[+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]] Choose a multi-letter key from the
STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section. The &quot;+&quot; is
optional since default direction is increasing numerical or
lexicographic order. Identical to --sort. Examples: ps
jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid ps axk comm o comm,args ps kstart_time
-ef</p>

<p>-n namelist set namelist file. Identical to N. The
namelist file is needed for a proper WCHAN display, and must
match the current Linux kernel exactly for correct output.
Without this option, the default search path for the
namelist is:</p>

<p>$PS_SYSMAP $PS_SYSTEM_MAP /proc/*/wchan
/boot/System.map-&lsquo;uname -r&lsquo; /boot/System.map
/lib/modules/&lsquo;uname -r&lsquo;/System.map
/usr/src/linux/System.map /System.map</p>

<p>n Numeric output for WCHAN and USER. (including all
types of UID and GID)</p>

<p>-w Wide output. Use this option twice for unlimited
width.</p>

<p>w Wide output. Use this option twice for unlimited
width.</p>

<p>--cols n set screen width</p>

<p>--columns n set screen width</p>

<p>--cumulative include some dead child process data (as a
sum with the parent)</p>

<p>--forest ASCII art process tree</p>

<p>--headers repeat header lines, one per page of
output</p>

<p>--no-headers print no header line at all</p>

<p>--lines n set screen height</p>

<p>--rows n set screen height</p>

<p>--sort spec specify sorting order. Sorting syntax is
[+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]] Choose a multi-letter key from the
STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section. The &quot;+&quot; is
optional since default direction is increasing numerical or
lexicographic order. Identical to k. For example: ps jax
--sort=uid,-ppid,+pid</p>

<p>--width n set screen width</p>

<p>THREAD DISPLAY H Show threads as if they were
processes</p>

<p>-L Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns</p>

<p>-T Show threads, possibly with SPID column</p>

<p>m Show threads after processes</p>

<p>-m Show threads after processes</p>

<p>OTHER INFORMATION L List all format specifiers.</p>

<p>-V Print the procps version.</p>

<p>V Print the procps version.</p>

<p>--help Print a help message.</p>

<p>--info Print debugging info.</p>

<p>--version Print the procps version.</p>

<p>NOTES This ps works by reading the virtual files in
/proc. This ps does not need to be setuid kmem or have any
privileges to run. Do not give this ps any special
permissions.</p>

<p>This ps needs access to namelist data for proper WCHAN
display. For kernels prior to 2.6, the System.map file must
be installed.</p>

<p>CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of
time spent running during the entire lifetime of a process.
This is not ideal, and it does not conform to the standards
that ps otherwise conforms to. CPU usage is unlikely to add
up to exactly 100%.</p>

<p>The SIZE and RSS fields dont count some parts of a
process including the page tables, kernel stack, struct
thread_info, and struct task_struct. This is usually at
least 20 KiB of memory that is always resident. SIZE is the
virtual size of the process (code+data+stack).</p>

<p>Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes
(so-called &quot;zombies&quot;) that remain because their
parent has not destroyed them properly. These processes will
be destroyed by init(8) if the parent process exits.</p>

<p>If the length of the username is greater than the length
of the display column, the numeric user ID is displayed
instead.</p>

<p>PROCESS FLAGS The sum of these values is displayed in
the &quot;F&quot; column, which is provided by the flags
output specifier. 1 forked but didnt exec 4 used super-user
privileges</p>

<p>PROCESS STATE CODES Here are the different values that
the s, stat and state output specifiers (header
&quot;STAT&quot; or &quot;S&quot;) will display to describe
the state of a process. D Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
R Running or runnable (on run queue) S Interruptible sleep
(waiting for an event to complete) T Stopped, either by a
job control signal or because it is being traced. W paging
(not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel) X dead (should never be
seen) Z Defunct (&quot;zombie&quot;) process, terminated but
not reaped by its parent.</p>

<p>For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used,
additional characters may be displayed: &lt; high-priority
(not nice to other users) N low-priority (nice to other
users) L has pages locked into memory (for real-time and
custom IO) s is a session leader l is multi-threaded (using
CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do) + is in the foreground
process group</p>

<p>OBSOLETE SORT KEYS These keys are used by the BSD O
option (when it is used for sorting). The GNU --sort option
doesn t use these keys, but the specifiers described below
in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section. Note that the
values used in sorting are the internal values ps uses and
not the &quot;cooked&quot; values used in some of the output
format fields (e.g. sorting on tty will sort into device
number, not according to the terminal name displayed). Pipe
ps output into the sort(1) command if you want to sort the
cooked values.</p>

<p>KEY LONG DESCRIPTION c cmd simple name of executable C
pcpu cpu utilization f flags flags as in long format F field
g pgrp process group ID G tpgid controlling tty process

<p>S share amount of shared pages t tty the device number
of the controlling tty T start_time time process was started
U uid user ID number u user user name v vsize total VM size

<p>AIX FORMAT DESCRIPTORS This ps supports AIX format
descriptors, which work somewhat like the formatting codes
of printf(1) and printf(3). For example, the normal default
output can be produced with this: ps -eo &quot;%p %y %x
%c&quot;. The NORMAL codes are described in the next
section.</p>

<p>CODE NORMAL HEADER %C pcpu %CPU %G group GROUP %P ppid
PPID %U user USER %a args COMMAND %c comm COMMAND %g rgroup
RGROUP %n nice NI %p pid PID %r pgid PGID %t etime ELAPSED
%u ruser RUSER %x time TIME %y tty TTY %z vsz VSZ</p>

<p>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS Here are the different
keywords that may be used to control the output format (e.g.
with option -o) or to sort the selected processes with the
GNU-style --sort option.</p>

<p>For example: ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user</p>

<p>This version of ps tries to recognize most of the
keywords used in other implementations of ps.</p>

<p>The following user-defined format specifiers may contain
spaces: args, cmd, comm, command, fname, ucmd, ucomm,
lstart, bsdstart, start.</p>

<p>Some keywords may not be available for sorting.</p>

<p>CODE HEADER DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>%cpu %CPU cpu utilization of the process in
&quot;##.#&quot; format. Currently, it is the CPU time used
divided by the time the process has been running
(cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage. It will
not add up to 100% unless you are lucky. (alias pcpu).</p>

<p>%mem %MEM ratio of the processs resident set size to the
physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.
(alias pmem).</p>

<p>args COMMAND command with all its arguments as a string.
Modifications to the arguments may be shown. The output in
this column may contain spaces. A process marked
&lt;defunct&gt; is partly dead, waiting to be fully
destroyed by its parent. Sometimes the process args will be
unavailable; when this happens, ps will instead print the
executable name in brackets. (alias cmd, command). See also
the comm format keyword, the -f option, and the c option.
When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of
the display. If ps can not determine display width, as when
output is redirected (piped) into a file or another command,
the output width is undefined. (it may be 80, unlimited,
determined by the TERM variable, and so on) The COLUMNS
environment variable or --cols option may be used to exactly
determine the width in this case. The w or -w option may be
also be used to adjust width.</p>

<p>blocked BLOCKED mask of the blocked signals, see
signal(7). According to the width of the field, a 32-bit or
64-bit mask in hexadecimal format is displayed. (alias
sig_block, sigmask).</p>

<p>bsdstart START time the command started. If the process
was started less than 24 hours ago, the output format is
&quot; HH:MM&quot;, else it is &quot;mmm dd&quot; (where mmm
is the three letters of the month). See also lstart, start,
start_time, and stime.</p>

<p>bsdtime TIME accumulated cpu time, user + system. The
display format is usually &quot;MMM:SS&quot;, but can be
shifted to the right if the process used more than 999
minutes of cpu time.</p>

<p>c C processor utilization. Currently, this is the
integer value of the percent usage over the lifetime of the
process. (see %cpu).</p>

<p>caught CAUGHT mask of the caught signals, see signal(7).
According to the width of the field, a 32 or 64 bits mask in
hexadecimal format is displayed. (alias sig_catch,
sigcatch).</p>

<p>cgroup CGROUP display control groups to which the
process belonges.</p>

<p>class CLS scheduling class of the process. (alias
policy, cls). Fields possible values are: - not reported TS
SCHED_OTHER FF SCHED_FIFO RR SCHED_RR B SCHED_BATCH ISO
SCHED_ISO IDL SCHED_IDLE ? unknown value</p>

<p>cls CLS scheduling class of the process. (alias policy,
class). Fields possible values are: - not reported TS
SCHED_OTHER FF SCHED_FIFO RR SCHED_RR B SCHED_BATCH ISO
SCHED_ISO IDL SCHED_IDLE ? unknown value</p>

<p>cmd CMD see args. (alias args, command).</p>

<p>comm COMMAND command name (only the executable name).
Modifications to the command name will not be shown. A
process marked &lt;defunct&gt; is partly dead, waiting to be
fully destroyed by its parent. The output in this column may
contain spaces. (alias ucmd, ucomm). See also the args
format keyword, the -f option, and the c option. When
specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the
display. If ps can not determine display width, as when
output is redirected (piped) into a file or another command,
the output width is undefined. (it may be 80, unlimited,
determined by the TERM variable, and so on) The COLUMNS
environment variable or --cols option may be used to exactly
determine the width in this case. The w or -w option may be
also be used to adjust width.</p>

<p>command COMMAND see args. (alias args, cmd).</p>

<p>cp CP per-mill (tenths of a percent) CPU usage. (see
%cpu).</p>

<p>cputime TIME cumulative CPU time,
&quot;[dd-]hh:mm:ss&quot; format. (alias time).</p>

<p>egid EGID effective group ID number of the process as a
decimal integer. (alias gid).</p>

<p>egroup EGROUP effective group ID of the process. This
will be the textual group ID, if it can be obtained and the
field width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.
(alias group).</p>

<p>eip EIP instruction pointer.</p>

<p>esp ESP stack pointer.</p>

<p>etime ELAPSED elapsed time since the process was
started, in the form [[dd-]hh:]mm:ss.</p>

<p>euid EUID effective user ID. (alias uid).</p>

<p>euser EUSER effective user name. This will be the
textual user ID, if it can be obtained and the field width
permits, or a decimal representation otherwise. The n option
can be used to force the decimal representation. (alias
uname, user).</p>

<p>f F flags associated with the process, see the PROCESS
FLAGS section. (alias flag, flags).</p>

<p>fgid FGID filesystem access group ID. (alias fsgid).</p>

<p>fgroup FGROUP filesystem access group ID. This will be
the textual user ID, if it can be obtained and the field
width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise. (alias
fsgroup).</p>

<p>flag F see f. (alias f, flags).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables could affect ps:</p>

<p>COLUMNS Override default display width.</p>

<p>LINES Override default display height.</p>

<p>PS_PERSONALITY Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd,
sun, digital... (see section PERSONALITY below).</p>

<p>CMD_ENV Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun,
digital... (see section PERSONALITY below).</p>

<p>I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS Force obsolete command line
interpretation.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Date format.</p>

<p>PS_COLORS Not currently supported.</p>

<p>PS_FORMAT Default output format override. You may set
this to a format string of the type used for the -o option.
The DefSysV and DefBSD values are particularly useful.</p>

<p>PS_SYSMAP Default namelist (System.map) location.</p>

<p>PS_SYSTEM_MAP Default namelist (System.map)
location.</p>

<p>POSIXLY_CORRECT Dont find excuses to ignore bad
&quot;features&quot;.</p>

<p>POSIX2 When set to &quot;on&quot;, acts as
POSIXLY_CORRECT.</p>

<p>UNIX95 Dont find excuses to ignore bad
&quot;features&quot;.</p>

<p>_XPG Cancel CMD_ENV=irix non-standard behavior.</p>

<p>In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables. The
one exception is CMD_ENV or PS_PERSONALITY, which could be
set to Linux for normal systems. Without that setting, ps
follows the useless and bad parts of the Unix98
standard.</p>

<p>PERSONALITY 390 like the S/390 OpenEdition ps aix like
AIX ps bsd like FreeBSD ps (totally non-standard) compaq
like Digital Unix ps debian like the old Debian ps digital
like Tru64 (was Digital Unix, was OSF/1) ps gnu like the old
Debian ps hp like HP-UX ps hpux like HP-UX ps irix like Irix
ps linux ***** RECOMMENDED ***** old like the original Linux
ps (totally non-standard) os390 like OS/390 Open Edition ps
posix standard s390 like OS/390 Open Edition ps sco like SCO
ps sgi like Irix ps solaris2 like Solaris 2+ (SunOS 5) ps
sunos4 like SunOS 4 (Solaris 1) ps (totally non-standard)
svr4 standard sysv standard tru64 like Tru64 (was Digital
Unix, was OSF/1) ps unix standard unix95 standard unix98
standard</p>

<p>SEE ALSO top(1), pgrep(1), pstree(1), proc(5).</p>

<p>STANDARDS This ps conforms to:</p>

<p>1 Version 2 of the Single Unix Specification 2 The Open
Group Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 6 3 IEEE
Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition 4 X/Open System Interfaces
Extension [UP XSI] 5 ISO/IEC 9945:2003</p>

<p>AUTHOR ps was originally written by Branko Lankester
&lt;lankeste@fwi.uva.nl&gt;. Michael K. Johnson
&lt;johnsonm@redhat.com&gt; re-wrote it significantly to use
the proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.
Michael Shields &lt;mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu&gt; added the
pid-list feature. Charles Blake &lt;cblake@bbn.com&gt; added
multi-level sorting, the dirent-style library, the device
name-to-number mmaped database, the approximate binary
search directly on System.map, and many code and
documentation cleanups. David Mossberger-Tang wrote the
generic BFD support for psupdate. Albert Cahalan
&lt;albert@users.sf.net&gt; rewrote ps for full Unix98 and
BSD support, along with some ugly hacks for obsolete and
foreign syntax.</p>
