<p>NAME replace - a string-replacement utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS replace arguments</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The replace utility program changes strings
in place in files or on the standard input.</p>

<p>Invoke replace in one of the following ways:</p>

<p>shell&gt; replace from to [from to] ... -- file_name
[file_name] ... shell&gt; replace from to [from to] ... &lt;
file_name</p>

<p>from represents a string to look for and to represents
its replacement. There can be one or more pairs of
strings.</p>

<p>Use the -- option to indicate where the
string-replacement list ends and the file names begin. In
this case, any file named on the command line is modified in
place, so you may want to make a copy of the original before
converting it. replace prints a message indicating which of
the input files it actually modifies.</p>

<p>If the -- option is not given, replace reads the
standard input and writes to the standard output.</p>

<p>replace uses a finite state machine to match longer
strings first. It can be used to swap strings. For example,
the following command swaps a and b in the given files,
file1 and file2:</p>

<p>shell&gt; replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...</p>

<p>The replace program is used by msql2mysql. See
msql2mysql(1).</p>

<p>replace supports the following options.</p>

<p>&middot; -?, -I</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; -#debug_options</p>

<p>Enable debugging.</p>

<p>&middot; -v</p>

program does.</p>
