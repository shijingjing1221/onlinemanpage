<p>NAME gc - count graph components</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gc [ -necCaDUrs? ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gc is a graph analogue to wc in that it
prints to standard output the number of nodes, edges,
connected components or clusters contained in the input
files. It also prints a total count for all graphs if more
than one graph is given.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-n Count nodes.</p>

<p>-e Count edges.</p>

<p>-c Count connected components.</p>

<p>-C Count clusters. By definition, a cluster is a graph
or subgraph whose name begins with &quot;cluster&quot;.</p>

<p>-a Count all. Equivalent to -encC</p>

<p>-r Recursively analyze subgraphs.</p>

<p>-s Print no output. Only exit value is important.</p>

<p>-D Only analyze directed graphs.</p>

<p>-U Only analyze undirected graphs.</p>

<p>-? Print usage information.</p>

<p>By default, gc returns the number of nodes and
edges.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot
format. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>1 The -U or -E option was used, and a graph of the wrong
type was encountered.</p>
