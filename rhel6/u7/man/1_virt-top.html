<p>VIRT-TOP(1) Virtualization Support VIRT-TOP(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-top - top-like utility for virtualization
stats</p>

<p>SUMMARY virt-top [-options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-top is a top(1)-like utility for
showing stats of virtualized domains. Many keys and command
line options are the same as for ordinary top.</p>

<p>It uses libvirt so it is capable of showing stats across
a variety of different virtualization systems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -1 Display physical CPUs by default (instead of
domains).</p>

<p>Under each domain column, two numbers are shown. The
first is the percentage of the physical CPU used by the
domain and the hypervisor together. The second is the
percentage used by just the domain.</p>

<p>When virt-top is running, use the 1 key to toggle
between physical CPUs and domains display.</p>

<p>-2 Display network interfaces by default (instead of
domains). When virt-top is running, use the 2 key to toggle
between network interfaces and domains display.</p>

<p>-3 Display block devices (virtual disks) by default
(instead of domains). When virt-top is running, use the 3
key to toggle between block devices and domains display.</p>

<p>-b Batch mode. In this mode keypresses are ignored.</p>

<p>-c uri or --connect uri Connect to the libvirt URI
given.</p>

<p>To connect to QEMU/KVM you would normally do -c
qemu:///system</p>

<p>To connect to Xen on the same host, do -c xen:///</p>

<p>To connect to libvirtd on a remote machine you would
normally do -c qemu://host/system</p>

<p>If this option is not given then virt-top connects by
default to whatever is the default hypervisor for libvirt,
although this can be overridden by setting environment
variables.</p>

<p>See the libvirt documentation at
&lt;http://libvirt.org/uri.html&gt; for further
information.</p>

<p>-d delay Set the delay between screen updates in
seconds. The default is 3.0 seconds. You can change this
while virt-top is running by pressing either s or d key.</p>

<p>-n iterations Set the number of iterations to run. The
default is to run continuously.</p>

<p>-o sort Set the sort order to one of: cpu (sort by %CPU
used), mem (sort by total memory), time (sort by total
time), id (sort by domain ID), name (sort by domain name),
netrx (sort by network received bytes), nettx (sort by
network transmitted bytes), blockrdrq (sort by block device
[disk] read requests), blockwrrq (sort by block device
[disk] write requests).</p>

<p>While virt-top is running you can change the sort order
using keys P (cpu), M (memory), T (total time), N (domain
ID), F (interactively select the sort field).</p>

<p>-s Secure mode. Currently this does nothing.</p>

<p>--hist-cpu secs Set the time in seconds between updates
of the historical %CPU at the top right of the display.</p>

<p>--csv file.csv Write the statistics to file file.csv.
First a header is written showing the statistics being
recorded in each column, then one line is written for each
screen update. The CSV file can be loaded directly by most
spreadsheet programs.</p>

<p>Currently the statistics which this records vary between
releases of virt-top (but the column headers will stay the
same, so you can use those to process the CSV file).</p>

<p>Not every version of virt-top supports CSV output - it
depends how the program was compiled (see README file in the
source distribution for details).</p>

<p>To save space you can compress your CSV files (if your
shell supports this feature, eg. bash):</p>

<p>virt-top --csv &gt;(gzip -9 &gt; output.csv.gz)</p>

<p>You can use a similar trick to split the CSV file up. In
this example the CSV file is split every 1000 lines into
files called output.csv.00, output.csv.01 etc.</p>

<p>virt-top --csv &gt;(split -d -l 1000 - output.csv.)</p>

<p>RHEL 6 provides a short Python script called
&quot;processcsv.py&quot; which can be used to post-process
the CSV output. Run it like this:</p>

<p>virt-top --csv data.csv processcsv.py &lt; data.csv</p>

<p>This creates or overwrites the following files in the
current directory:</p>

<p>global.csv domain&lt;NNN&gt;.csv</p>

<p>&quot;global.csv&quot; will contain the global data. One
&quot;domain&lt;NNN&gt;.csv&quot; file will also be created
for each domain with ID &quot;NNN&quot;, containing the
per-domain data.</p>

<p>--no-csv-cpu Disable domain CPU stats in CSV output.</p>

<p>--no-csv-mem Disable domain memory stats in CSV
output.</p>

<p>--no-csv-block Disable domain block device stats in CSV
output.</p>

<p>--no-csv-net Disable domain network interface stats in
CSV output.</p>

<p>--debug filename Send debug and error messages to
filename. To send error messages to syslog you can do:</p>

<p>virt-top --debug &gt;(logger -t virt-top)</p>

<p>See also REPORTING BUGS below.</p>

<p>--init-file filename Read filename as the init file
instead of the default which is $HOME/.virt-toprc. See also
INIT FILE below.</p>

<p>--no-init-file Do not read any init file.</p>

<p>--script Script mode. There will be no user interface.
This is most useful when used together with the --csv and -n
options.</p>

<p>--stream Stream mode. All output is sent to stdout. This
can be used from shell scripts etc. There is no user
interface.</p>

<p>--block-in-bytes Show I/O statistics in Bytes. Default
is shown in the number of Requests.</p>

<p>--end-time time The program will exit at the time
given.</p>

<p>The time may be given in one of the following
formats:</p>

<p>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS End time is the date and time
given.</p>

<p>HH:MM:SS End time is the time given, today.</p>

<p>+HH:MM:SS End time is HH hours, MM minutes, SS seconds
in the future (counted from the moment that program
starts).</p>

<p>+secs End time is secs seconds in the future.</p>

<p>For example to run the program for 3 minutes you could
do:</p>

<p>virt-top --end-time +00:03:00</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>virt-top --end-time +180</p>

<p>Not every version of virt-top supports this option - it
depends how the program was compiled (see README file in the
source distribution for details).</p>

<p>--help Display usage summary.</p>

<p>KEYS Note that keys are case sensitive. For example use
upper-case P (shift P) to sort by %CPU. ^ before a key means
a Ctrl key, so ^L is Ctrl L.</p>

<p>space or ^L Updates the display.</p>

<p>q Quits the program.</p>

<p>h Displays help.</p>

<p>s or d Change the delay between screen updates.</p>

<p>B Toggle Block I/O statistics so they are shown in
either bytes or requests.</p>

<p>0 (number 0) Show the normal list of domains
display.</p>

<p>1 (number 1) Toggle into showing physical CPUs. If
pressed again toggles back to showing domains (the normal
display).</p>

<p>2 Toggle into showing network interfaces. If pressed
again toggles back to showing domains.</p>

<p>3 Toggle into showing block devices (virtual disks). If
pressed again toggles back to showing domains.</p>

<p>P Sort by %CPU.</p>

<p>M Sort by total memory. Note that this shows the total
memory allocated to the guest, not the memory being
used.</p>

<p>T Sort by total time.</p>

<p>N Sort by domain ID.</p>

<p>F Select the sort field interactively (there are other
sort fields you can choose using this key).</p>

<p>W This creates or overwrites the init file with the
current settings.</p>

<p>This key is disabled if --no-init-file was specified on
the command line or if overwrite-init-file false is given in
the init file.</p>

<p>INIT FILE When virt-top starts up, it reads initial
settings from the file .virt-toprc in the users home
directory.</p>

<p>The name of this file may be overridden using the
--init-file filename command line option or may be disabled
entirely using --no-init-file.</p>

<p>The init file has a simple format. Blank lines and
comments beginning with # are ignored. Everything else is a
set of key value pairs, described below.</p>

<p>display task|pcpu|block|net Sets the major display mode
to one of task (tasks, the default), pcpu (physical CPUs),
block (block devices), or net (network interfaces).</p>

<p>delay secs Sets the delay between display updates in
seconds.</p>

<p>hist-cpu secs Sets the historical CPU delay in
seconds.</p>

<p>iterations n Sets the number of iterations to run before
we exit. Setting this to -1 means to run continuously.</p>

<p>sort cpu|mem|time|id|name|... Sets the sort order. The
option names are the same as for the command line -o
option.</p>

<p>connect uri Sets the default connection URI.</p>

<p>debug filename Sets the default filename to use for
debug and error messages.</p>

<p>csv filename Enables CSV output to the named file.</p>

<p>csv-cpu true|false Enable or disable domain CPU stats in
CSV output.</p>

<p>csv-mem true|false Enable or disable domain memory stats
in CSV output.</p>

<p>csv-block true|false Enable or disable domain block
device stats in CSV output.</p>

<p>csv-net true|false Enable or disable domain network
interface stats in CSV output.</p>

<p>batch true|false Sets batch mode.</p>

<p>secure true|false Sets secure mode.</p>

<p>script true|false Sets script mode.</p>

<p>stream true|false Sets stream mode.</p>

<p>block-in-bytes true|false Show block device statistics
in bytes.</p>

<p>end-time time Set the time at which the program exits.
See above for the time formats supported.</p>

<p>overwrite-init-file false If set to false then the W key
will not overwrite the init file.</p>

<p>Note that in the current implementation, options
specified in the init file override options specified on the
command line. This is a bug and this behaviour may change in
the future.</p>

<p>COLUMN HEADINGS %CPU Percentage of CPU used. As with
top(1), 100% means that all physical CPUs are being fully
used.</p>

<p>DEVICE The block device name.</p>

<p>DOMAIN NAME The name of the libvirt domain.</p>

<p>ID The libvirt domain ID.</p>

<p>INTERFACE The network interface name.</p>

<p>%MEM The percentage of host memory assigned to the
guest.</p>

<p>PHYCPU The physical CPU.</p>

<p>RDBY Disk bytes read since last displayed.</p>

<p>RDRQ Disk read requests since last displayed.</p>

<p>RXBY Network bytes received since last displayed.</p>

<p>RXPK Network packets received since last displayed.</p>

<p>S The state of the domain, one of:</p>

<p>? Unknown.</p>

<p>R Running.</p>

<p>S Blocked.</p>

<p>P Paused.</p>

<p>D O Shutdown.</p>

<p>X Crashed.</p>

<p>TIME Total CPU time used.</p>

<p>TXBY Network bytes transmitted since last displayed.</p>

<p>TXPK Network packets transmitted since last
displayed.</p>

<p>WRBY Disk bytes written since last displayed.</p>

<p>WRRQ Disk write requests since last displayed.</p>

<p>NOTES Block I/O statistics This I/O value is the amount
of I/O since the previous iteration of virt-top. To
calculate speed of I/O, you should divide the number by
delay secs.</p>

<p>NETWORK RX BYTES AND PACKETS Libvirt/virt-top has no way
to know that a packet transmitted to a guest was received
(eg. if the guest is not listening). In the network RX
stats, virt-top reports the packets transmitted to the
guest, on the basis that the guest might receive them.</p>

<p>In particular this includes broadcast packets. Because
of the way that Linux bridges work, if the guest is
connected to a bridge, it will probably see a steady
&quot;background noise&quot; of RX packets even when the
network interface is idle or down. These are caused by STP
packets generated by the bridge.</p>

<p>DEBUGGING LIBVIRT ISSUES virt-top tries to turn libvirt
errors into informative messages. However if libvirt
initialization fails then this is not possible. Instead you
will get an obscure error like:</p>

<p>libvir: error : Unknown failure Fatal error: exception
Libvirt.Virterror(...)</p>

<p>To see the cause of libvirt errors in more detail,
enable libvirt debugging by setting this environment
variable:</p>

<p>export LIBVIRT_DEBUG=1</p>
