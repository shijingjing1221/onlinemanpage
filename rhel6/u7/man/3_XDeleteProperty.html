<p>XGetWindowProperty(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XGetWindowProperty(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGetWindowProperty, XListProperties,
XChangeProperty, XRotateWindow- Properties, XDeleteProperty
- obtain and change window properties</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XGetWindowProperty(Display *display, Window
w, Atom property, long long_offset, long long_length, Bool
delete, Atom req_type, Atom *actual_type_return, int
*actual_format_return, unsigned long *nitems_return,
unsigned long *bytes_after_return, unsigned char
**prop_return);</p>

<p>Atom *XListProperties(Display *display, Window w, int
*num_prop_return);</p>

<p>int XChangeProperty(Display *display, Window w, Atom
property, Atom type, int format, int mode, unsigned char
*data, int nelements);</p>

<p>int XRotateWindowProperties(Display *display, Window w,
Atom proper- ties[], int num_prop, int npositions);</p>

<p>int XDeleteProperty(Display *display, Window w, Atom
property);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS actual_format_return Returns the actual format
of the property.</p>

<p>actual_type_return Returns the atom identifier that
defines the actual type of the property.</p>

<p>bytes_after_return Returns the number of bytes remaining
to be read in the prop- erty if a partial read was
performed.</p>

<p>data Specifies the property data.</p>

<p>delete Specifies a Boolean value that determines whether
the prop- erty is deleted.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>format Specifies whether the data should be viewed as a
list of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit quantities. Possible values
are 8, 16, and 32. This information allows the X server to
cor- rectly perform byte-swap operations as necessary. If
the format is 16-bit or 32-bit, you must explicitly cast
your data pointer to an (unsigned char *) in the call to
XChange- Property.</p>

<p>long_length Specifies the length in 32-bit multiples of
the data to be retrieved.</p>

<p>long_offset Specifies the offset in the specified
property (in 32-bit quantities) where the data is to be
retrieved.</p>

<p>mode Specifies the mode of the operation. You can pass
PropMod- eReplace, PropModePrepend, or PropModeAppend.</p>

<p>nelements Specifies the number of elements of the
specified data for- mat.</p>

<p>nitems_return Returns the actual number of 8-bit,
16-bit, or 32-bit items stored in the prop_return data.</p>

<p>num_prop Specifies the length of the properties
array.</p>

<p>num_prop_return Returns the length of the properties
array.</p>

<p>npositions Specifies the rotation amount.</p>

<p>prop_return Returns the data in the specified format. If
the returned format is 8, the returned data is represented
as a char array. If the returned format is 16, the returned
data is represented as a array of short int type and should
be cast to that type to obtain the elements. If the returned
format is 32, the property data will be stored as an array
of longs (which in a 64-bit application will be 64-bit
values that are padded in the upper 4 bytes).</p>

<p>property Specifies the property name.</p>

<p>properties Specifies the array of properties that are to
be rotated.</p>

<p>req_type Specifies the atom identifier associated with
the property type or AnyPropertyType.</p>

<p>type Specifies the type of the property. The X server
does not interpret the type but simply passes it back to an
applica- tion that later calls XGetWindowProperty.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window whose property you want to
obtain, change, rotate or delete.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGetWindowProperty function returns the
actual type of the prop- erty; the actual format of the
property; the number of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit items
transferred; the number of bytes remaining to be read in the
property; and a pointer to the data actually returned.
XGetWin- dowProperty sets the return arguments as
follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If the specified property does not exist for
the specified window, XGetWindowProperty returns None to
actual_type_return and the value zero to
actual_format_return and bytes_after_return. The
nitems_return argument is empty. In this case, the delete
argu- ment is ignored.</p>

<p>&middot; If the specified property exists but its type
does not match the specified type, XGetWindowProperty
returns the actual property type to actual_type_return, the
actual property format (never zero) to actual_format_return,
and the property length in bytes (even if the
actual_format_return is 16 or 32) to bytes_after_return. It
also ignores the delete argument. The nitems_return argument
is empty.</p>

<p>&middot; If the specified property exists and either you
assign AnyProper- tyType to the req_type argument or the
specified type matches the actual property type,
XGetWindowProperty returns the actual prop- erty type to
actual_type_return and the actual property format (never
zero) to actual_format_return. It also returns a value to
bytes_after_return and nitems_return, by defining the
following values:</p>

<p>N = actual length of the stored property in bytes (even
if the format is 16 or 32) I = 4 * long_offset T = N - I L =
MINIMUM(T, 4 * long_length) A = N - (I + L)</p>

<p>The returned value starts at byte index I in the
property (index- ing from zero), and its length in bytes is
L. If the value for long_offset causes L to be negative, a
BadValue error results. The value of bytes_after_return is
A, giving the number of trail- ing unread bytes in the
stored property.</p>

<p>If the returned format is 8, the returned data is
represented as a char array. If the returned format is 16,
the returned data is represented as a short array and should
be cast to that type to obtain the ele- ments. If the
returned format is 32, the returned data is represented as a
long array and should be cast to that type to obtain the
elements.</p>

<p>XGetWindowProperty always allocates one extra byte in
prop_return (even if the property is zero length) and sets
it to zero so that simple properties consisting of
characters do not have to be copied into yet another string
before use.</p>

<p>If delete is True and bytes_after_return is zero,
XGetWindowProperty deletes the property from the window and
generates a PropertyNotify event on the window.</p>

<p>The function returns Success if it executes
successfully. To free the resulting data, use XFree.</p>

<p>XGetWindowProperty can generate BadAtom, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XListProperties function returns a pointer to an
array of atom properties that are defined for the specified
window or returns NULL if no properties were found. To free
the memory allocated by this func- tion, use XFree.</p>

<p>XListProperties can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>The XChangeProperty function alters the property for the
specified win- dow and causes the X server to generate a
PropertyNotify event on that window. XChangeProperty
performs the following:</p>

<p>&middot; If mode is PropModeReplace, XChangeProperty
discards the previous property value and stores the new
data.</p>

<p>&middot; If mode is PropModePrepend or PropModeAppend,
XChangeProperty inserts the specified data before the
beginning of the existing data or onto the end of the
existing data, respectively. The type and format must match
the existing property value, or a BadMatch error results. If
the property is undefined, it is treated as defined with the
correct type and format with zero-length data.</p>

<p>If the specified format is 8, the property data must be
a char array. If the specified format is 16, the property
data must be a short array. If the specified format is 32,
the property data must be a long array.</p>

<p>The lifetime of a property is not tied to the storing
client. Proper- ties remain until explicitly deleted, until
the window is destroyed, or until the server resets. For a
discussion of what happens when the connection to the X
server is closed, see section 2.6. The maximum size of a
property is server dependent and can vary dynamically
depend- ing on the amount of memory the server has
available. (If there is insufficient space, a BadAlloc error
results.)</p>

<p>XChangeProperty can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom,
BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XRotateWindowProperties function allows you to
rotate properties on a window and causes the X server to
generate PropertyNotify events. If the property names in the
properties array are viewed as being numbered starting from
zero and if there are num_prop property names in the list,
then the value associated with property name I becomes the
value associated with property name (I + npositions) mod N
for all I from zero to N - 1. The effect is to rotate the
states by npositions places around the virtual ring of
property names (right for positive nposi- tions, left for
negative npositions). If npositions mod N is nonzero, the X
server generates a PropertyNotify event for each property in
the order that they are listed in the array. If an atom
occurs more than once in the list or no property with that
name is defined for the win- dow, a BadMatch error results.
If a BadAtom or BadMatch error results, no properties are
changed.</p>

<p>XRotateWindowProperties can generate BadAtom, BadMatch,
and BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XDeleteProperty function deletes the specified
property only if the property was defined on the specified
window and causes the X server to generate a PropertyNotify
event on the window unless the property does not exist.</p>

<p>XDeleteProperty can generate BadAtom and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadAtom A value for an Atom argument does not name a
defined Atom.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
