xcb_expose_event_t(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_expose_event_t - NOT YET DOCUMENTED</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Event datastructure typedef struct xcb_expose_event_t {
uint8_t response_type; uint8_t pad0; uint16_t sequence;
xcb_window_t window; uint16_t x; uint16_t y; uint16_t width;
uint16_t height; uint16_t count; uint8_t pad1[2]; }
xcb_expose_event_t;</p>

<p>EVENT FIELDS response_type The type of this event, in
this case XCB_EXPOSE. This field is also present in the
xcb_generic_event_t and can be used to tell events apart
from each other.</p>

<p>sequence The sequence number of the last request
processed by the X11 server.</p>

<p>window The exposed (damaged) window.</p>

<p>x The X coordinate of the left-upper corner of the
exposed rectangle, relative to the windows origin.</p>

<p>y The Y coordinate of the left-upper corner of the
exposed rectangle, relative to the windows origin.</p>

<p>width The width of the exposed rectangle.</p>

<p>height The height of the exposed rectangle.</p>

<p>count The amount of Expose events following this one.
Simple appli- cations that do not want to optimize redisplay
by distin- guishing between subareas of its window can just
ignore all Expose events with nonzero counts and perform
full redisplays on events with zero counts.</p>
