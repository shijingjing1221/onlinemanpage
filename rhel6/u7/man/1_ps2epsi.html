<p>NAME ps2epsi - generate conforming Encapsulated
PostScript</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ] (Unix)
ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epi ] (DOS)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ps2epsi uses gs(1) to process a
PostScript(tm) file and generate as output a new file which
conforms to Adobes Encapsulated PostScript Interchange
(EPSI) format. EPSI is a special form of encapsulated
PostScript (EPS) which adds to the beginning of the file in
the form of PostScript comments a bitmapped version of the
final displayed page. Programs which understand EPSI
(usually word processors or DTP pro- grams) can use this
bitmap to give a preview version on screen of the
PostScript. The displayed quality is often not very good
(e.g., low resolution, no colours), but the final printed
version uses the real PostScript, and thus has the normal
PostScript quality.</p>

<p>USAGE On Unix systems invoke ps2epsi like this:</p>

<p>ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ]</p>

<p>where &quot;infile.ps&quot; is the input file and
&quot;outfile.epsi&quot; is the resulting EPSI file. If the
output filename is omitted, it is generated from the input
filename. When a standard extension (&quot;.ps&quot;,
&quot;.cps&quot;, &quot;.eps&quot; or &quot;.epsf&quot;) is
used, it is replaced with the output extension
&quot;.epsi&quot;. On DOS systems the command is:</p>

<p>ps2epsi infile.ps outfile.epi</p>

<p>where &quot;infile.ps&quot; is the original PostScript
file, and &quot;outfile.epi&quot; is the name of the output
file.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Not every PostScript file can be
encapsulated successfully, because there are restrictions on
what PostScript constructs a correct encapsu- lated file may
contain. ps2epsi does a little extra work to try to help
encapsulation, and it automatically calculates the bounding
box required for all encapsulated PostScript files, so most
of the time it does a pretty good job. There are certain to
be cases, however, where the encapsulation does not work
because of the content of the original PostScript file.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY The Framemaker DTP system is one
application which understands EPSI files, and ps2epsi has
been tested on a number of PostScript diagrams from a
variety of sources, using Framemaker 3.0 on a Sun
workstation. Framemaker on other platforms should be able to
use these files, although I have not been able to test
this.</p>
