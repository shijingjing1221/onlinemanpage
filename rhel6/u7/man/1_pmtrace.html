<p>NAME pmtrace - command line performance
instrumentation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmtrace [-q] [-c value | -e command | -v value]
[-h host] [-S state] tag</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmtrace provides a simple command line
interface to the trace Perfor- mance Metrics Domain Agent
(PMDA) and the associated pcp_trace library.</p>

<p>The default pmtrace behavior is to provide point trace
data to the trace PMDA, using the tag argument as the
identifying name associated with each trace point. The tag
then becomes an instance identifier within the set of
trace.point metrics.</p>

<p>The -e option allows an arbitrary command to be
executed. This command will be measured as a transaction
since it has well defined start and end points. The
information is made available through the trace.trans- act
metrics.</p>

<p>Trace data can be sent to the trace PMDA running on
host, rather than the localhost, using the -h option. This
overrides use of the environ- ment variable
PCP_TRACE_HOST.</p>

<p>The -q option suppresses messages from a successful
trace, so that pmtrace runs quietly.</p>

<p>The -c option allows an arbitrary counter value to be
exported through the trace.count metrics, while the -v
option allows an arbitrary float- ing point value to be
exported through the trace.observe metrics</p>

<p>The -S option enables internal debugging and tracing.
The value of state is a bit-wise combination of debug flags
as defined in pmtraces- tate(3), and may be specified using
the decimal or hexadecimal syntax prescribed by
strtol(3).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Since pmtrace uses the libpcp_trace library
routines, the environment variables PCP_TRACE_HOST,
PCP_TRACE_PORT, and PCP_TRACE_TIMEOUT are all honored. Refer
to pmdatrace(3) for a detailed description of the semantics
of each.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/trace/pmtrace.c source code for
pmtrace</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pmcd(1), pmdatrace(1), pmprobe(1), PMAPI(3),
and pmdatrace(3).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All are generated on standard error and are
intended to be self- explanatory.</p>

<p>The pmtrace exit status is always zero except when the
-e option is in use, in which case the exit status of
command is returned.</p>
