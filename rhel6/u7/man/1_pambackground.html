<p>NAME pambackground - create a mask of the background
area of an image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pambackground</p>

<p>[netpbmfile]</p>

<p>[-verbose=]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of options are acceptable.
You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to
denote options. You may use white space in place of the
equals sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pambackground reads a PNM or PAM image as input. It
generates as out- put a PAM image that identifies the
background area of the image (a mask).</p>

<p>To identify the background, pambackground assumes the
image is a fore- ground image, smaller than the total image
size, placed over a single- color background. It assumes
that foreground image is solid -- it does not have holes
through which the background can be seen. So in spe- cific,
pambackground first identifies the background color, then
finds all contiguous pixels of that color in regions
touching any edge of the image. Think of it as starting at
each of the four edges and moving inward as far as possible
until it hits pixels of another color (the foreground
image).</p>

<p>pambackground identifies the background color as
follows: If any 3 cor- ners of the image are the same color,
that s the background color. If not, but 2 corners are the
same color, the background color is the color of a pair of
identically colored corners in this priority order: top,
right, left, bottom. If no two corners have the same color,
the background color is the color of the upper left
corner.</p>

<p>In a typical photograph, the area that you would
consider the back- ground is many shades of a color, so to
pambackground it is multiple colors and pambackground will
not meaningfully identify the background of your image. To
use pambackground in this case, you might use ppm- change to
change all similar colors to a single one first. For exam-
ple, if the photograph is a building against a blue sky,
where nothing remotely sky-blue appears in the building, you
could use ppmchange to change all pixels within 20% of
SkyBlue to SkyBlue, then run pamback- ground on it.</p>

<p>In Release 10.37, pambackground does not really do what
is promised above. It cant see places where the background
appears in the middle of a row (think of the sky between two
buildings). From Release 10.38 forward, it snakes through
whatever passages it has to to find all the background.</p>

<p>The PAM that pambackground creates has a single plane,
with a maxval of 1. The sample value 1 means background; 0
means foreground. There is no tuple type. Some older
programs (but none that are part of Netpbm) dont know what a
PAM is and expect a mask to be in the form of a PGM or PBM
image. To convert pambackgrounds output to PBM, use pamtopnm
-assume. To convert to PGM, use pgmtopgm.</p>

<p>netpbmfile is the file specification of the input file,
or - to indi- cate Standard Input. The default is Standard
Input.</p>

<p>A common use for a background mask is with pamcomp. You
could replace the entire background (or foreground) of your
image with something else.</p>

<p>Another common use is to make an image with the
background transparent (in some image format that has a
concept of transparency; not Netpbm formats) so that image
can be overlaid onto another image later. Netpbms converters
to image formats that have transparency (e.g. PNG) let you
use the mask that pambackground generates to identify the
transparent areas for the output.</p>

<p>To simply make a mask of all the areas of a specified
color, use ppm- colormask. If you have a unique background
color (one that doesnt occur in the foreground) and know
what it is, this can create a back- ground mask in cases
that pambackground cannot: where there are see- through
holes in the foreground image.</p>

process.</p>
