<p>guestfs-testing(1) Virtualization Support
guestfs-testing(1)</p>

<p>NAME guestfs-testing - manual testing of libguestfs, you
can help!</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This page has manual tests you can try on
libguestfs. Everyone has a slightly different combination of
platform, hardware and guests, so this testing is very
valuable. Thanks for helping out!</p>

<p>These tests require libguestfs 1.14.</p>

<p>Tests marked with a * (asterisk) can destroy data if
youre not careful. The others are safe and wont modify
anything.</p>

<p>You can report bugs you find through this link:</p>


<p>https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?component=libguestfs&amp;product=Virtualization+Tools</p>

<p>or post on the mailing list (registration is not
required, but if youre not registered then you ll have to
wait for a moderator to manually approve your message):</p>

<p>https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libguestfs</p>

<p>TESTS Run libguestfs-test-tool Run:</p>

<p>libguestfs-test-tool</p>

<p>This command does a very simple, non-destructive test
that basic libguestfs is functioning. You dont need to run
it as root.</p>

<p>If it doesnt print &quot;===== TEST FINISHED OK
=====&quot;, report it as a bug. It is very important that
you include the complete, unedited output of
&quot;libguestfs-test-tool&quot; in your bug report. See the
&quot;BUGS&quot; section at the end of this page.</p>

<p>Check KVM acceleration is being used. If your host has
hardware virt acceleration, then with a hot cache libguestfs
should be able to start up in a few seconds. Run the
following command a few times:</p>

<p>time guestfish -a /dev/null run</p>

<p>After a few runs, the time should settle down to a few
seconds (under 5 seconds on fast 64 bit hardware).</p>

<p>How to check for hardware virt:</p>

<p>http://virt-tools.org/learning/check-hardware-virt/</p>

<p>If the command above does not work at all, use
libguestfs-test-tool(1).</p>

<p>Run virt-alignment-scan on all your guests. Run
virt-alignment-scan(1) on guests or disk images:</p>

<p>virt-alignment-scan -a /path/to/disk.img</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>virt-alignment-scan -d Guest</p>

<p>Does the alignment report match how the guest partitions
are aligned?</p>

<p>Run virt-cat on some files in guests. virt-cat(1) can
display files from guests. For a Linux guest, try:</p>

<p>virt-cat LinuxGuest /etc/passwd</p>

<p>A recent feature is support for Windows paths, for
example:</p>

<p>virt-cat WindowsGuest &rsquo;c:192&rsquo;</p>

<p>An even better test is if you have a Windows guest with
multiple drives. Do &quot;D:&quot;, &quot;E:&quot; etc paths
work correctly?</p>

<p>* Copy some files into a shut off guest. virt-copy-in(1)
can recursively copy files and directories into a guest or
disk image.</p>

<p>virt-copy-in -d Guest /etc /tmp</p>

<p>This should copy local directory &quot;/etc&quot; to
&quot;/tmp/etc&quot; in the guest (recursively). If you boot
the guest, can you see all of the copied files and
directories?</p>

<p>Shut the guest down and try copying multiple files and
directories:</p>

<p>virt-copy-in -d Guest /home /etc/issue /tmp</p>

<p>Copy some files out of a guest. virt-copy-out(1) can
recursively copy files and directories out of a guest or
disk image.</p>

<p>virt-copy-out -d Guest /home .</p>

<p>Note the final space and period in the command is not a
typo.</p>

<p>This should copy &quot;/home&quot; from the guest into
the current directory.</p>

<p>Run virt-df. virt-df(1) lists disk space. Run:</p>

<p>virt-df</p>

<p>You can try comparing this to the results from df(1)
inside the guest, but there are some provisos:</p>

<p>&middot; The guest must be idle.</p>

<p>&middot; The guest disks must be synched using
sync(1).</p>

<p>&middot; Any action such as booting the guest will write
log files causing the numbers to change.</p>

<p>We dont guarantee that the numbers will be identical
even under these circumstances. They should be similar. It
would indicate a bug if you saw greatly differing
numbers.</p>

<p>Try importing virt-df CSV output into a spreadsheet or
database. Run:</p>

<p>virt-df --csv &gt; /tmp/report.csv</p>

<p>Now try to load this into your favorite spreadsheet or
database. Are the results reproduced faithfully in the
spreadsheet/database?</p>

<p>http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/sql-copy.html
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html</p>

<p>* Edit a file in a shut off guest. virt-edit(1) can edit
files in guests. Try this command on a RHEL or Fedora
guest:</p>

<p>virt-edit LinuxGuest /etc/sysconfig/network</p>

<p>On other Linux guests try editing other files such
as:</p>

<p>virt-edit LinuxGuest /etc/motd</p>

<p>Are the changes seen inside the guest when it is
booted?</p>

<p>Display the filesystems / partitions / LVs in a guest.
virt-filesystems(1) can be used to display filesystems in a
guest. Try this command on any disk image or guest:</p>

<p>virt-filesystems -a /path/to/disk.img --all --long
-h</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>virt-filesystems -d Guest --all --long -h</p>

<p>Do the results match what is seen in the guest?</p>

<p>Run virt-inspector on all your guests. Use
virt-inspector(1) to get a report on all of your guests or
disk images:</p>

<p>virt-inspector -a /path/to/disk.img | less</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>virt-inspector -d Guest | less</p>

<p>Do the results match what is actually in the guest?</p>

<p>Try the auditing features of virt-ls on all your guests.
List all setuid or setgid programs in a Linux virtual
machine:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d Guest / | grep &rsquo;^- [42]&rsquo;</p>

<p>List all public-writable directories in a Linux virtual
machine:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d Guest / | grep &rsquo;^d ...7&rsquo;</p>

<p>List all Unix domain sockets in a Linux virtual
machine:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d Guest / | grep &rsquo;^s&rsquo;</p>

<p>List all regular files with filenames ending in
.png:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d Guest / | grep -i
&rsquo;^-.*.png$&rsquo;</p>

<p>Display files larger than 10MB in home directories:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d Guest /home | awk &rsquo;$3 &gt;
10*1024*1024&rsquo;</p>

<p>Find everything modified in the last 7 days:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d Guest --time-days / | awk &rsquo;$6 &lt;=
7&rsquo;</p>

<p>Find regular files modified in the last 24 hours:</p>

<p>virt-ls -lR -d Guest --time-days / | grep
&rsquo;^-&rsquo; | awk &rsquo;$6 &lt; 1&rsquo;</p>

<p>Do the results match what is in the guest?</p>

<p>Create a disk image from a tarball. Use virt-make-fs(1)
to create a disk image from any tarball that you happen to
have:</p>

<p>virt-make-fs --partition=mbr --type=vfat
/any/tarball.tar.gz output.img</p>

<p>Add output.img as a raw disk to an existing guest. Check
the guest can see the files. This test is particularly
useful if you try it with a Windows guest.</p>

<p>Try other partitioning schemes, eg. --partition=gpt.</p>

<p>Try other filesystem formats, eg. --type=ntfs,
--type=ext2.</p>

<p>* Run virt-rescue on a shut off disk image or guest. Use
virt-rescue(1) to examine, rescue or repair a shut off guest
or disk image:</p>

<p>virt-rescue -a /path/to/disk.img</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>virt-rescue -d Guest</p>

<p>Can you use ordinary shell commands to examine the
guest?</p>

<p>* Resize your guests. Use virt-resize(1) to give a guest
some more disk space. For example, if you have a disk image
that is smaller than 30G, increase it to 30G by doing:</p>

<p>truncate -s 30G newdisk.img virt-filesystems -a
/path/to/olddisk.img --all --long -h virt-resize
/path/to/olddisk.img newdisk.img --expand /dev/sda1 qemu-kvm
-m 1024 -hda newdisk.img</p>

<p>Does the guest still boot? Try expanding other
partitions.</p>

<p>* Sparsify a guest disk. Using virt-sparsify(1), make a
disk image more sparse:</p>

<p>virt-sparsify /path/to/olddisk.img newdisk.img</p>

<p>Is &quot;newdisk.img&quot; still bootable after
sparsifying? Is the resulting disk image smaller (use
&quot;du&quot; to check)?</p>

<p>* &quot;sysprep&quot; a shut off Linux guest. Note that
this really will mess up an existing guest, so its better to
clone the guest before trying this.</p>

<p>virt-sysprep --hostname newhost.example.com -a
/path/to/disk.img</p>

<p>Was the sysprep successful? After booting, what changes
were made and were they successful?</p>

<p>Dump the Windows Registry from your Windows guests. Use
virt-win-reg(1) to dump out the Windows Registry from any
Windows guests that you have.</p>

<p>virt-win-reg --unsafe-printable-strings WindowsGuest
&rsquo;HKLMtware&rsquo; | less</p>

<p>virt-win-reg --unsafe-printable-strings WindowsGuest
&rsquo;HKLMtem&rsquo; | less</p>

<p>Does the output match running &quot;regedit&quot; inside
the guest?</p>

<p>A recent feature is the ability to dump user registries,
so try this, replacing username with the name of a local
user in the guest:</p>

<p>virt-win-reg --unsafe-printable-strings WindowsGuest
&rsquo;HKEY_USERSsername&rsquo; | less</p>
