<p>UNGETC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UNGETC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME ungetc - push byte back into input stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ungetc() function shall push the byte
specified by c (converted to an unsigned char) back onto the
input stream pointed to by stream. The pushed-back bytes
shall be returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the
reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening
call (with the stream pointed to by stream) to a
file-positioning function ( fseek(), fsetpos(), or rewind())
shall discard any pushed-back bytes for the stream. The
external storage corresponding to the stream shall be
unchanged.</p>

<p>One byte of push-back shall be provided. If ungetc() is
called too many times on the same stream without an
intervening read or file-position- ing operation on that
stream, the operation may fail.</p>

<p>If the value of c equals that of the macro EOF, the
operation shall fail and the input stream shall be left
unchanged.</p>

<p>A successful call to ungetc() shall clear the
end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the
file-position indicator for the stream after reading or
discarding all pushed-back bytes shall be the same as it was
before the bytes were pushed back. The file-position
indicator is decremented by each successful call to
ungetc(); if its value was 0 before a call, its value is
unspecified after the call.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, ungetc() shall
return the byte pushed back after conversion. Otherwise, it
shall return EOF.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>
