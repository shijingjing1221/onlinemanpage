<p>INTLTOOL-PREPARE(8) INTLTOOL-PREPARE(8)</p>

<p>NAME intltool-prepare - Prepare software to make use of
intltool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS intltool-prepare [option] [KEYWORD]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For software packages that include some
specific type of translatable files (such as .desktop and
.soundlist), before they make use of intl- tool, translators
have to dig through them one by one, and add their
localization into each file. This process is error prone,
since trans- lators may include typing errors, or add their
localization in wrong encoding. Besides, translators may not
alwas know other files (beside .po files) are
translatable.</p>

<p>intltool avoids all the problems above by extracting
strings inside those translatable files into po template
(.pot) file. All translators need to care about is just
translating po files. Afterwards, intltool- merge(8) will
merge localized strings into those files.</p>

<p>Before your software becomes intltool-aware, a few
issues have to be sorted out, and intltool-prepare tries to
take care of all of them. intltool-prepare will:</p>

<p>&middot; Extract all localized strings in .desktop style
files (including &quot;.desktop&quot;,
&quot;.soundlist&quot;, &quot;.keys&quot; and
&quot;.directory&quot;) into correspond- ing po files.</p>

<p>&middot; Convert the translatable files into templates
that don t contain any localization.</p>

<p>&middot; Add the list of template files above into
POTFILES.in.</p>

<p>&middot; Add the list of old translatable files into
.cvsignore (since they will be generated by intltool
later).</p>

<p>&middot; Add the rules for generating these files into
Makefile.am.</p>

<p>NOTE: You must change working directory to the top level
source direc- tory before running intltool-prepare.</p>

<p>OPTIONS KEYWORD is a list of additional keywords beside
&quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Comment&quot; and
&quot;description&quot;. intltool-prepare will recognize any
line starting with those KEYWORD and extract localized
strings after equal sign (&quot;=&quot;).</p>

<p>-x --verbose Be verbose to give user additional
feedback.</p>

<p>-v --version Show version information. -h --help Show
usage and basic help information.</p>
