<p>NAME XCreateWindowEvent - CreateNotify event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for CreateNotify events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* CreateNotify */ unsigned
long serial; /* # of last request processed by server */
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ Display *display; /* Display the event was read
from */ Window parent; /* parent of the window */ Window
window; /* window id of window created */ int x, y; /*
window location */ int width, height; /* size of window */
int border_width; /* border width */ Bool override_redirect;
/* creation should be overridden */ }
XCreateWindowEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive this event, the structure members are
set as follows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The parent member is set to the created window s parent.
The window member specifies the created window. The x and y
members are set to the created windows coordinates relative
to the parent windows origin and indicate the position of
the upper-left outside corner of the cre- ated window. The
width and height members are set to the inside size of the
created window (not including the border) and are always
nonzero. The border_width member is set to the width of the
created window s border, in pixels. The override_redirect
member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the
window. Window manager clients nor- mally should ignore this
window if the override_redirect member is True.</p>
