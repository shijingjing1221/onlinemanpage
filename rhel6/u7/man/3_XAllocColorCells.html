<p>DESCRIPTION The XAllocColor function allocates a
read-only colormap entry corre- sponding to the closest RGB
value supported by the hardware. XAlloc- Color returns the
pixel value of the color closest to the specified RGB
elements supported by the hardware and returns the RGB value
actually used. The corresponding colormap cell is read-only.
In addition, XAl- locColor returns nonzero if it succeeded
or zero if it failed. Multi- ple clients that request the
same effective RGB value can be assigned the same read-only
entry, thus allowing entries to be shared. When the last
client deallocates a shared cell, it is deallocated.
XAllocColor does not use or affect the flags in the XColor
structure.</p>

<p>XAllocColor can generate a BadColor error.</p>

<p>The XAllocNamedColor function looks up the named color
with respect to the screen that is associated with the
specified colormap. It returns both the exact database
definition and the closest color supported by the screen.
The allocated color cell is read-only. The pixel value is
returned in screen_def_return. If the color name is not in
the Host Portable Character Encoding, the result is
implementation-dependent. Use of uppercase or lowercase does
not matter. If screen_def_return and exact_def_return point
to the same structure, the pixel field will be set
correctly, but the color values are undefined.
XAllocNamedColor returns nonzero if a cell is allocated;
otherwise, it returns zero.</p>

<p>XAllocNamedColor can generate a BadColor error.</p>

<p>The XAllocColorCells function allocates read/write color
cells. The number of colors must be positive and the number
of planes nonnegative, or a BadValue error results. If
ncolors and nplanes are requested, then ncolors pixels and
nplane plane masks are returned. No mask will have any bits
set to 1 in common with any other mask or with any of the
pixels. By ORing together each pixel with zero or more
masks, ncolors * 2nplanes distinct pixels can be produced.
All of these are allocated writable by the request. For
GrayScale or PseudoColor, each mask has exactly one bit set
to 1. For DirectColor, each has exactly three bits set to 1.
If contig is True and if all masks are ORed together, a sin-
gle contiguous set of bits set to 1 will be formed for
GrayScale or PseudoColor and three contiguous sets of bits
set to 1 (one within each pixel subfield) for DirectColor.
The RGB values of the allocated entries are undefined.
XAllocColorCells returns nonzero if it suc- ceeded or zero
if it failed.</p>

<p>XAllocColorCells can generate BadColor and BadValue
errors.</p>

<p>The specified ncolors must be positive; and nreds,
ngreens, and nblues must be nonnegative, or a BadValue error
results. If ncolors colors, nreds reds, ngreens greens, and
nblues blues are requested, ncolors pixels are returned; and
the masks have nreds, ngreens, and nblues bits set to 1,
respectively. If contig is True, each mask will have a con-
tiguous set of bits set to 1. No mask will have any bits set
to 1 in common with any other mask or with any of the
pixels. For DirectColor, each mask will lie within the
corresponding pixel subfield. By ORing together subsets of
masks with each pixel value, ncolors *
2(nreds+ngreens+nblues) distinct pixel values can be
produced. All of these are allocated by the request.
However, in the colormap, there are only ncolors * 2nreds
independent red entries, ncolors * 2ngreens independent
green entries, and ncolors * 2nblues independent blue
entries. This is true even for PseudoColor. When the
colormap entry of a pixel value is changed (using
XStoreColors, XStoreColor, or XStoreNamedColor), the pixel
is decomposed according to the masks, and the corresponding
independent entries are updated. XAllocColorPlanes returns
nonzero if it succeeded or zero if it failed.</p>

<p>XAllocColorPlanes can generate BadColor and BadValue
errors.</p>

<p>The XFreeColors function frees the cells represented by
pixels whose values are in the pixels array. The planes
argument should not have any bits set to 1 in common with
any of the pixels. The set of all pixels is produced by
ORing together subsets of the planes argument with the
pixels. The request frees all of these pixels that were
allo- cated by the client (using XAllocColor,
XAllocNamedColor, XAllocColor- Cells, and
XAllocColorPlanes). Note that freeing an individual pixel
obtained from XAllocColorPlanes may not actually allow it to
be reused until all of its related pixels are also freed.
Similarly, a read-only entry is not actually freed until it
has been freed by all clients, and if a client allocates the
same read-only entry multiple times, it must free the entry
that many times before the entry is actually freed.</p>

<p>All specified pixels that are allocated by the client in
the colormap are freed, even if one or more pixels produce
an error. If a specified pixel is not a valid index into the
colormap, a BadValue error results. If a specified pixel is
not allocated by the client (that is, is unal- located or is
only allocated by another client) or if the colormap was
created with all entries writable (by passing AllocAll to
XCreateCol- ormap), a BadAccess error results. If more than
one pixel is in error, the one that gets reported is
arbitrary.</p>

<p>XFreeColors can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess A client attempted to free a color
map entry that it did not already allocate.</p>

<p>BadAccess A client attempted to store into a read-only
color map entry.</p>

<p>BadColor A value for a Colormap argument does not name a
defined Col- ormap.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
