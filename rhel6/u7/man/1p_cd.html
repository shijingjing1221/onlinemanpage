<p>CD(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CD(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cd - change the working directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cd [-L | -P] [directory]</p>

<p>cd -</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cd utility shall change the working
directory of the current shell execution environment (see
Shell Execution Environment ) by executing the following
steps in sequence. (In the following steps, the symbol
curpath represents an intermediate value used to simplify
the descrip- tion of the algorithm used by cd. There is no
requirement that curpath be made visible to the
application.)</p>

<p>1. If no directory operand is given and the HOME
environment variable is empty or undefined, the default
behavior is implementation- defined and no further steps
shall be taken.</p>

<p>2. If no directory operand is given and the HOME
environment variable is set to a non-empty value, the cd
utility shall behave as if the directory named in the HOME
environment variable was specified as the directory
operand.</p>

<p>3. If the directory operand begins with a slash
character, set curpath to the operand and proceed to step
7.</p>

<p>4. If the first component of the directory operand is
dot or dot-dot, proceed to step 6.</p>

<p>5. Starting with the first pathname in the
colon-separated pathnames of CDPATH (see the ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES section) if the pathname is non-null, test if the
concatenation of that pathname, a slash character, and the
directory operand names a directory. If the pathname is
null, test if the concatenation of dot, a slash charac- ter,
and the operand names a directory. In either case, if the
resulting string names an existing directory, set curpath to
that string and proceed to step 7. Otherwise, repeat this
step with the next pathname in CDPATH until all pathnames
have been tested.</p>

<p>6. Set curpath to the string formed by the concatenation
of the value of PWD, a slash character, and the operand.</p>

<p>7. If the -P option is in effect, the cd utility shall
perform actions equivalent to the chdir() function, called
with curpath as the path argument. If these actions succeed,
the PWD environment variable shall be set to an absolute
pathname for the current working direc- tory and shall not
contain filename components that, in the context of pathname
resolution, refer to a file of type symbolic link. If there
is insufficient permission on the new directory, or on any
parent of that directory, to determine the current working
direc- tory, the value of the PWD environment variable is
unspecified. If the actions equivalent to chdir() fail for
any reason, the cd util- ity shall display an appropriate
error message and not alter the PWD environment variable.
Whether the actions equivalent to chdir() succeed or fail,
no further steps shall be taken.</p>

<p>8. The curpath value shall then be converted to
canonical form as fol- lows, considering each component from
beginning to end, in sequence:</p>

<p>a. Dot components and any slashes that separate them
from the next component shall be deleted.</p>

<p>b. For each dot-dot component, if there is a preceding
component and it is neither root nor dot-dot, the preceding
component, all slashes separating the preceding component
from dot-dot, dot-dot and all slashes separating dot-dot
from the following component shall be deleted.</p>

<p>c. An implementation may further simplify curpath by
removing any trailing slash characters that are not also
leading slashes, replacing multiple non-leading consecutive
slashes with a sin- gle slash, and replacing three or more
leading slashes with a single slash. If, as a result of this
canonicalization, the curpath variable is null, no further
steps shall be taken.</p>

<p>9. The cd utility shall then perform actions equivalent
to the chdir() function called with curpath as the path
argument. If these actions failed for any reason, the cd
utility shall display an appropriate error message and no
further steps shall be taken. The PWD envi- ronment variable
shall be set to curpath.</p>

<p>If, during the execution of the above steps, the PWD
environment vari- able is changed, the OLDPWD environment
variable shall also be changed to the value of the old
working directory (that is the current working directory
immediately prior to the call to cd).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The cd utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-L Handle the operand dot-dot logically; symbolic link
components shall not be resolved before dot-dot components
are processed (see steps 8. and 9. in the DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p>-P Handle the operand dot-dot physically; symbolic link
components shall be resolved before dot-dot components are
processed (see step 7. in the DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p>If both -L and -P options are specified, the last of
these options shall be used and all others ignored. If
neither -L nor -P is speci- fied, the operand shall be
handled dot-dot logically; see the DESCRIP- TION.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>directory An absolute or relative pathname of the
directory that shall become the new working directory. The
interpretation of a rela- tive pathname by cd depends on the
-L option and the CDPATH and PWD environment variables. If
directory is an empty string, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p>- When a hyphen is used as the operand, this shall be
equivalent to the command:</p>

<p>cd &quot;$OLDPWD&quot; &amp;&amp; pwd</p>

<p>which changes to the previous working directory and then
writes its name.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of cd:</p>

<p>CDPATH A colon-separated list of pathnames that refer to
directories. The cd utility shall use this list in its
attempt to change the directory, as described in the
DESCRIPTION. An empty string in place of a directory
pathname represents the current directory. If CDPATH is not
set, it shall be treated as if it were an empty string.</p>

<p>HOME The name of the directory, used when no directory
operand is specified.</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>OLDPWD A pathname of the previous working directory,
used by cd -.</p>

<p>PWD This variable shall be set as specified in the
DESCRIPTION. If an application sets or unsets the value of
PWD, the behavior of cd is unspecified.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is
used, or if cd - is used, an absolute pathname of the new
working directory shall be written to the standard output as
follows:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;new directory&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, there shall be no output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The directory was successfully changed.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS The working directory shall
remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since cd affects the current shell
execution environment, it is always provided as a shell
regular built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate
utility execution environment, such as one of the
following:</p>

<p>(cd /tmp) nohup cd find . -exec cd {};</p>

<p>it does not affect the working directory of the callers
environment.</p>

<p>The user must have execute (search) permission in
directory in order to change to it.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The use of the CDPATH was introduced in the
System V shell. Its use is analogous to the use of the PATH
variable in the shell. The BSD C shell used a shell
parameter cdpath for this purpose.</p>

<p>A common extension when HOME is undefined is to get the
login directory from the user database for the invoking
user. This does not occur on System V implementations.</p>

<p>Some historical shells, such as the KornShell, took
special actions when the directory name contained a dot-dot
component, selecting the logical parent of the directory,
rather than the actual parent direc- tory; that is, it moved
up one level toward the/in the pathname, remembering what
the user typed, rather than performing the equivalent
of:</p>

<p>chdir(&quot;..&quot;);</p>

<p>In such a shell, the following commands would not
necessarily produce equivalent output for all
directories:</p>

<p>cd .. &amp;&amp; ls ls ..</p>

<p>This behavior is now the default. It is not consistent
with the defini- tion of dot-dot in most historical
practice; that is, while this behav- ior has been optionally
available in the KornShell, other shells have historically
not supported this functionality. The logical pathname is
stored in the PWD environment variable when the cd utility
completes and this value is used to construct the next
directory name if cd is invoked with the -L option.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
