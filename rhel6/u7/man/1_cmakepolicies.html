<p>NAME cmakepolicies - Reference of CMake policies.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &quot;cmake&quot; executable is the
CMake command-line interface. It may be used to configure
projects in scripts. Project configuration settings may be
specified on the command line with the -D option. The -i
option will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such
settings.</p>

<p>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.
Projects specify their build process with
platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build
system for a native tool on their platform.</p>

<p>POLICIES CMP0000 A minimum required CMake version must
be specified.</p>

<p>CMake requires that projects specify the version of
CMake to which they have been written. This policy has been
put in place so users trying to build the project may be
told when they need to update their CMake. Specifying a
version also helps the project build with CMake versions
newer than that specified. Use the cmake_minimum_required
command at the top of your main CMakeLists.txt file:</p>

<p>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION
&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;)</p>

<p>where &quot;&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;&quot; is the
version of CMake you want to sup- port (such as
&quot;2.6&quot;). The command will ensure that at least the
given version of CMake is running and help newer versions be
compatible with the project. See documentation of
cmake_mini- mum_required for details.</p>

<p>Note that the command invocation must appear in the
CMake- Lists.txt file itself; a call in an included file is
not suffi- cient. However, the cmake_policy command may be
called to set policy CMP0000 to OLD or NEW behavior
explicitly. The OLD behavior is to silently ignore the
missing invocation. The NEW behavior is to issue an error
instead of a warning. An included file may set CMP0000
explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the
main CMakeLists.txt file.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.</p>

<p>CMP0001 CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY should no longer
be used.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior is to check
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY and present it to the user.
The NEW behavior is to ignore CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
completely.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.4 and below the variable
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY was used to request
compatibility with earlier versions of CMake. In CMake 2.6
and above all com- patibility issues are handled by policies
and the cmake_policy command. However, CMake must still
check CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COM- PATIBILITY for projects written
for CMake 2.4 and below.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0002 Logical target names must be globally
unique.</p>

<p>Targets names created with add_executable, add_library,
or add_custom_target are logical build target names. Logical
tar- get names must be globally unique because:</p>

<p>- Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in
CMake code and on make tool command lines. - Logical names
are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators to produce
meaningful project names for the targets.</p>

<p>The logical name of executable and library targets does
not have to correspond to the physical file names built.
Consider using the OUTPUT_NAME target property to create two
targets with the same physical name while keeping logical
names distinct. Custom targets must simply have globally
unique names (unless one uses the global property
ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Make- files
generator).</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0003 Libraries linked via full path no longer produce
linker search paths.</p>

<p>This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are
NOT known are found at link time, but was created due to a
change in how CMake deals with libraries whose full paths
are known. Consider the code</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)</p>

<p>CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries
whose full paths are known by splitting them on the link
line into separate components consisting of the linker
search path and the library name. The example code might
have produced something like</p>

<p>... -L/path/to -lA ...</p>

<p>in order to link to library A. An analysis was performed
to order multiple link directories such that the linker
would find library A in the desired location, but there are
cases in which this does not work. CMake versions 2.6 and
above use the more reliable approach of passing the full
path to libraries directly to the linker in most cases. The
example code now produces something like</p>

<p>... /path/to/libA.so ....</p>

<p>Unfortunately this change can break code like</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)</p>

<p>where &quot;B&quot; is meant to find
&quot;/path/to/libB.so&quot;. This code is wrong because the
user is asking the linker to find library B but has not
provided a linker search path (which may be added with the
link_directories command). However, with the old link- ing
implementation the code would work accidentally because the
linker search path added for library A allowed library B to
be found.</p>

<p>In order to support projects depending on linker search
paths added by linking to libraries with known full paths,
the OLD behavior for this policy will add the linker search
paths even though they are not needed for their own
libraries. When this policy is set to OLD, CMake will
produce a link line such as</p>

<p>... -L/path/to /path/to/libA.so -lB ...</p>

<p>which will allow library B to be found as it was
previously. When this policy is set to NEW, CMake will
produce a link line such as</p>

<p>... /path/to/libA.so -lB ...</p>

<p>which more accurately matches what the project
specified.</p>

<p>The setting for this policy used when generating the
link line is that in effect when the target is created by an
add_exe- cutable or add_library command. For the example
described above, the code</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION
2.4) add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)</p>

<p>will work and suppress the warning for this policy. It
may also be updated to work with the corrected linking
approach:</p>

<p>cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION
2.6) link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
add_executable(myexe myexe.c) target_link_libraries(myexe
/path/to/libA.so B)</p>

<p>Even better, library B may be specified with a full
path:</p>

<p>add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so
/path/to/libB.so)</p>

<p>When all items on the link line have known paths CMake
does not check this policy so it has no effect.</p>

<p>Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for
at most one target. This avoids flooding users with messages
for every target when setting the policy once will probably
fix all tar- gets.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0004 Libraries linked may not have leading or
trailing whitespace.</p>

<p>CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading
and trail- ing whitespace from libraries linked with code
like</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe &quot; A &quot;)</p>

<p>This could lead to subtle errors in user projects.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently remove
leading and trailing whitespace. The NEW behavior for this
policy is to diagnose the existence of such whitespace as an
error. The set- ting for this policy used when checking the
library names is that in effect when the target is created
by an add_executable or add_library command.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0005 Preprocessor definition values are now escaped
automatically.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether or not CMake should
generate escaped preprocessor definition values added via
add_defini- tions. CMake versions 2.4 and below assumed that
only trivial values would be given for macros in
add_definitions calls. It did not attempt to escape
non-trivial values such as string lit- erals in generated
build rules. CMake versions 2.6 and above support escaping
of most values, but cannot assume the user has not added
escapes already in an attempt to work around limita- tions
in earlier versions.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to place definition
values given to add_definitions directly in the generated
build rules without attempting to escape anything. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to generate correct escapes for
all native build tools automatically. See documentation of
the COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS target property for limitations of
the escaping implemen- tation.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0006 Installing MACOSX_BUNDLE targets requires a
BUNDLE DESTINATION.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether the install(TARGETS)
command must be given a BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to
install a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set. CMake
2.4 and below did not distinguish application bundles from
normal executables when installing targets. CMake 2.6
provides a BUNDLE option to the install(TARGETS) command
that specifies rules specific to appli- cation bundles on
the Mac. Projects should use this option when installing a
target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back to the
RUNTIME DESTINATION if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a
bundle tar- get is installed without a BUNDLE
DESTINATION.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0007 list command no longer ignores empty
elements.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether the list command will
ignore empty elements in the list. CMake 2.4 and below list
commands ignored all empty elements in the list. For
example, a;b;;c would have length 3 and not 4. The OLD
behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list elements.
The NEW behavior for this pol- icy is to correctly count
empty elements in a list.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0008 Libraries linked by full-path must have a valid
library file name.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code
like</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(myexe /full/path/to/somelib)</p>

<p>where &quot;somelib&quot; is supposed to be a valid
library file name such as &quot;libsomelib.a&quot; or
&quot;somelib.lib&quot;. For Makefile generators this
produces an error at build time because the dependency on
the full path cannot be found. For VS IDE and Xcode
generators this used to work by accident because CMake would
always split off the library directory and ask the linker to
search for the library by name (-lsomelib or somelib.lib).
Despite the failure with Makefiles, some projects have code
like this and build only with VS and/or Xcode. This version
of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the
native build tool, which will fail in this case because it
does not name a valid library file.</p>

<p>This policy determines what to do with full paths that
do not appear to name a valid library file. The OLD behavior
for this policy is to split the library name from the path
and ask the linker to search for it. The NEW behavior for
this policy is to trust the given path and pass it directly
to the native build tool unchanged.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.1. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0009 FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow
symlinks by default.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.6.1 and below, FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls would
follow through symlinks, sometimes coming up with
unexpectedly large result sets because of symlinks to top
level directories that contain hundreds of thousands of
files.</p>

<p>This policy determines whether or not to follow symlinks
encoun- tered during a FILE GLOB_RECURSE call. The OLD
behavior for this policy is to follow the symlinks. The NEW
behavior for this pol- icy is not to follow the symlinks by
default, but only if FOL- LOW_SYMLINKS is given as an
additional argument to the FILE com- mand.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.2. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0010 Bad variable reference syntax is an error.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference
syntax such as a missing close-brace (&quot;${FOO&quot;) was
reported but did not stop processing of CMake code. This
policy determines whether a bad variable reference is an
error. The OLD behavior for this policy is to warn about the
error, leave the string untouched, and continue. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to report an error.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0011 Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH
and POP.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in
scripts loaded by the include() and find_package() commands
would affect the includer. Explicit invocations of
cmake_policy(PUSH) and cmake_policy(POP) were required to
isolate policy changes and protect the includer. While some
scripts intend to affect the policies of their includer,
most do not. In CMake 2.6.3 and above, include() and
find_package() by default PUSH and POP an entry on the
policy stack around an included script, but provide a
NO_POLICY_SCOPE option to disable it. This policy determines
whether or not to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for compatibility.
The OLD behavior for this policy is to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE
for include() and find_package() commands. The NEW behavior
for this policy is to allow the commands to do their default
cmake_policy PUSH and POP.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0012 if() recognizes numbers and boolean
constants.</p>

<p>In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the if() command
implicitly dereferenced arguments corresponding to
variables, even those named like numbers or boolean
constants, except for 0 and 1. Numbers and boolean constants
such as true, false, yes, no, on, off, y, n, notfound,
ignore (all case insensitive) were recog- nized in some
cases but not all. For example, the code
&quot;if(TRUE)&quot; might have evaluated as false. Numbers
such as 2 were recognized only in boolean expressions like
&quot;if(NOT 2)&quot; (leading to false) but not as a
single-argument like &quot;if(2)&quot; (also leading to
false). Later versions of CMake prefer to treat numbers and
boolean constants literally, so they should not be used as
variable names.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to implicitly
dereference variables named like numbers and boolean
constants. The NEW behavior for this policy is to recognize
numbers and boolean constants without dereferencing
variables with such names.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0013 Duplicate binary directories are not
allowed.</p>

<p>CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted
add_subdirectory() calls to create the same binary directory
multiple times. Dur- ing build system generation files would
be written and then overwritten in the build tree and could
lead to strange behav- ior. CMake 2.6.4 and above explicitly
detect duplicate binary directories. CMake 2.6.4 always
considers this case an error. In CMake 2.8.0 and above this
policy determines whether or not the case is an error. The
OLD behavior for this policy is to allow duplicate binary
directories. The NEW behavior for this policy is to disallow
duplicate binary directories with an error.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0014 Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.</p>

<p>CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing
CMake- Lists.txt files in directories referenced by
add_subdirectory() or subdirs(), treating them as if present
but empty. In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines
whether or not the case is an error. The OLD behavior for
this policy is to silently ignore the problem. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to report an error.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0015 link_directories() treats paths relative to the
source dir.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the link_directories() command
passed relative paths unchanged to the linker. In CMake
2.8.1 and above the link_directories() command prefers to
interpret rela- tive paths with respect to
CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, which is consistent with
include_directories() and other commands. The OLD behavior
for this policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the
linker command. The NEW behavior for this policy is to
convert relative paths to absolute paths by appending the
rela- tive path to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.1. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0016 target_link_libraries() reports error if its
only argument is not a target.</p>

<p>In CMake 2.8.2 and lower the target_link_libraries()
command silently ignored if it was called with only one
argument, and this argument wasnt a valid target. In CMake
2.8.3 and above it reports an error in this case.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.3. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0017 Prefer files from the CMake module directory
when including from there.</p>

<p>Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped
with CMake (i.e. located in the CMake module directory)
calls include() or find_package(), the files located in the
CMake module directory are preferred over the files in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH. This makes sure that the modules
belonging to CMake always get those files included which
they expect, and against which they were devel- oped and
tested. In all other cases, the files found in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH still take precedence over the ones in the
CMake module directory. The OLD behaviour is to always
prefer files from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files from the
CMake modules directory.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.4. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0018 Ignore CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS
variable.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in SHARED and
MODULE libraries using the value of the undocumented
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS platform variable.
The vari- able contained platform-specific flags needed to
compile objects for shared libraries. Typically it included
a flag such as -fPIC for position independent code but also
included other flags needed on certain platforms. CMake
2.8.9 and higher pre- fer instead to use the
POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property to determine what
targets should be position independent, and new undocumented
platform variables to select flags while ignor- ing
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS completely.</p>

<p>The default for either approach produces identical
compilation flags, but if a project modifies
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS from its original
value this policy determines which approach to use.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore the
POSITION_INDE- PENDENT_CODE property for all targets and use
the modified value of
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS for SHARED and
MODULE libraries.</p>

<p>The NEW behavior for this policy is to ignore
CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_&lt;Lang&gt;_FLAGS whether it is
modified or not and honor the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
target property.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.9. CMake
ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD
or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0019 Do not re-expand variables in include and link
information.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the
include_directories, link_directories, and link_libraries
com- mands to expand any leftover variable references at the
end of the configuration step. This was for strict
compatibility with VERY early CMake versions because all
variable references are now normally evaluated during CMake
language processing. CMake 2.8.11 and higher prefer to skip
the extra evaluation.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to re-evaluate the
values for strict compatibility. The NEW behavior for this
policy is to leave the values untouched.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0020 Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain
target on Windows.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.10 and lower required users of Qt to always
specify a link dependency to the qtmain.lib static library
manually on Windows. CMake 2.8.11 gained the ability to
evaluate generator expressions while determining the link
dependencies from IMPORTED targets. This allows CMake itself
to automatically link executables which link to Qt to the
qtmain.lib library when using IMPORTED Qt targets. For
applications already linking to qtmain.lib, this should have
little impact. For applications which supply their own
alternative WinMain implementation and for applications
which use the QAxServer library, this automatic linking will
need to be disabled as per the documentation.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is not to link
executables to qtmain.lib automatically when they link to
the QtCore IMPORTED- target. The NEW behavior for this
policy is to link executables to qtmain.lib automatically
when they link to QtCore IMPORTED target.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0021 Fatal error on relative paths in
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.10.2 and lower allowed the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
target property to contain relative paths. The base path for
such rel- ative entries is not well defined. CMake 2.8.12
issues a FATAL_ERROR if the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property
contains a rela- tive path.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is not to warn about
relative paths in the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR
if INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES contains a relative path.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0022 INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES defines the link
interface.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.11 constructed the link interface of a target
from properties matching
(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CON- FIG&gt;)?.
The modern way to specify config-sensitive content is to use
generator expressions and the IMPORTED_ prefix makes uniform
processing of the link interface with generator expres-
sions impossible. The INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target
property was introduced as a replacement in CMake 2.8.12.
This new prop- erty is named consistently with the
INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINI- TIONS,
INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COM-
PILE_OPTIONS properties. For in-build targets, CMake will
use the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as the source of
the link interface only if policy CMP0022 is NEW. When
exporting a tar- get which has this policy set to NEW, only
the INTER- FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property will be processed
and generated for the IMPORTED target by default. A new
option to the install(EXPORT) and export commands allows
export of the old-style properties for compatibility with
downstream users of CMake versions older than 2.8.12. The
target_link_libraries command will no longer populate the
properties matching
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)? if this policy is
NEW.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore the INTER-
FACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property for in-build targets. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to use the
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property for in-build targets, and
ignore the old properties matching
(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_&lt;CONFIG&gt;)?.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.
CMake ver- sion 2.8.12.2 warns when the policy is not set
and uses OLD behavior. Use the cmake_policy command to set
it to OLD or NEW explicitly.</p>

<p>CMP0023 Plain and keyword target_link_libraries
signatures cannot be mixed.</p>

<p>CMake 2.8.12 introduced the target_link_libraries
signature using the PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and INTERFACE keywords
to generalize the LINK_PUBLIC and LINK_PRIVATE keywords
introduced in CMake 2.8.7. Use of signatures with any of
these keywords sets the link interface of a target
explicitly, even if empty. This pro- duces confusing
behavior when used in combination with the his- torical
behavior of the plain target_link_libraries signature. For
example, consider the code:</p>

<p>target_link_libraries(mylib A)
target_link_libraries(mylib PRIVATE B)</p>

<p>After the first line the link interface has not been set
explic- itly so CMake would use the link implementation, A,
as the link interface. However, the second line sets the
link interface to empty. In order to avoid this subtle
behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the plain and
keyword signatures of tar- get_link_libraries for a single
target.</p>

<p>The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow keyword and
plain target_link_libraries signatures to be mixed. The NEW
behavior for this policy is to not to allow mixing of the
keyword and plain signatures.</p>

<p>This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.
