<p>ACCT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual ACCT(2)</p>

<p>NAME acct - switch process accounting on or off</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acct(const char *filename);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>acct(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp;
_XOPEN_SOURCE &lt; 500)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acct() system call enables or disables
process accounting. If called with the name of an existing
file as its argument, accounting is turned on, and records
for each terminating process are appended to filename as it
terminates. An argument of NULL causes accounting to be
turned off.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Write permission is denied for the
specified file, or search permission is denied for one of
the directories in the path pre- fix of filename (see also
path_resolution(7)), or filename is not a regular file.</p>

<p>EFAULT filename points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EIO Error writing to the file filename.</p>

<p>EISDIR filename is a directory.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving filename.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG filename was too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOENT The specified filename does not exist.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Out of memory.</p>

<p>ENOSYS BSD process accounting has not been enabled when
the operating system kernel was compiled. The kernel
configuration parameter controlling this feature is
CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component used as a directory in filename is
not in fact a directory.</p>

<p>EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to
enable process accounting. On Linux the CAP_SYS_PACCT
capability is required.</p>

<p>EROFS filename refers to a file on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>EUSERS There are no more free file structures or we ran
out of memory.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD (but not POSIX).</p>

<p>NOTES No accounting is produced for programs running
when a system crash occurs. In particular, non-terminating
processes are never accounted for.</p>

<p>The structure of the records written to the accounting
file is described in acct(5).</p>
