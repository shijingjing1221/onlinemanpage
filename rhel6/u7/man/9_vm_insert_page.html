<p>NAME vm_insert_page - insert single page into user
vma</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int vm_insert_page(struct vm_area_struct * vma,
unsigned long addr, struct page * page);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS vma user vma to map to</p>

<p>addr target user address of this page</p>

<p>page source kernel page</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This allows drivers to insert individual
pages they&acute;ve allocated into a user vma.</p>

<p>The page has to be a nice clean _individual_ kernel
allocation. If you allocate a compound page, you need to
have marked it as such (__GFP_COMP), or manually just split
the page up yourself (see split_page).</p>

<p>NOTE! Traditionally this was done with remap_pfn_range
which took an arbitrary page protection parameter. This
doesn&acute;t allow that. Your vma protection will have to
be set up correctly, which means that if you want a shared
writable mapping, you&acute;d better ask for a shared
writable mapping!</p>

<p>The page does not need to be reserved.</p>
