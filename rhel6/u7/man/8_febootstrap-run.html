<p>NAME febootstrap-run - Run extra commands in febootstrap
root filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS febootstrap-run [--options] DIR [--] [CMD
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This can be used to run extra commands in
the febootstrap root filesystem. It is just a simple wrapper
around the standard &quot;fakeroot&quot; and
&quot;fakechroot&quot; commands.</p>

<p>If given, the &quot;CMD ...&quot; is run inside the root
filesystem. The command acts as if it was run as root and
chrooted into the root filesystem.</p>

<p>If the command is omitted, then we start a shell.</p>

<p>If &quot;CMD ...&quot; could contain anything starting
with a &quot;-&quot; character then use &quot;--&quot; to
separate &quot;febootstrap-run&quot; parameters from the
command:</p>

<p>febootstrap-run ./f10 -- ls -l</p>

<p>OPTIONS --ro Usually any changes to permissions made by
the command are recorded in the &quot;fakeroot.log&quot;
file. However if &quot;--ro&quot; flag is given, then
changes to permissions are not recorded. (Note: changes to
file contents still happen).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Remove a directory subtree safely:</p>

<p>febootstrap-run initramfs -- rm -r /etc</p>

<p>(This requires that you have a compatible rm command in
the root).</p>

<p>Another way to do complex operations from a script is to
export a function:</p>

<p>#!/bin/bash</p>

<p>do_stuff () { # complex operations inside the root }
export -f do_stuff febootstrap-run root -- bash -c
do_stuff</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES Some fakechroot(1) environment
variables are applicable. In particular you may want to
set:</p>

<p>export FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH=/proc</p>
