<p>NAME tuna - program for tuning running processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tuna [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page explains the tuna program.
The program can be used to change the attributes of
application and kernel threads. The tuna can operate on IRQs
by name or number, and tasks or threads by process ID or
command-line. CPUs and sets of CPUs can be specified by CPU
or socket number. IRQ names and process command-lines can
include wild- cards.</p>

<p>tuna can change scheduling policy, scheduler priority
and processor affinity for processes and process threads.
tuna can also change the processor affinity for interrupts.
When tuna is invoked without any options it starts up in its
graphical interface mode. This manual page explains only the
command-line options for tuna</p>

<p>OPTIONS tuna has both action options and modifier
options. Modifier options must be specified on the
command-line before the actions they are intended to modify.
Any modifier option applies to following actions on the same
command-line until it is over-ridden.</p>

<p>Actions</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a list of options. tuna will exit after
this action, ignoring the remainder of the command-line.</p>

<p>-g, --gui Start the GUI. Actions that follow this on the
command-line will be processed without waiting for the GUI
to complete.</p>

<p>-a, --config_file_apply=profilename Apply changes
described in profile</p>

<p>-l, --config_file_list List preloaded profiles</p>

<p>-i, --isolate Move all threads away from CPU-LIST.
Requires -c or -S.</p>

<p>-I, --include Allow all threads to run on CPU-LIST.
Requires -c or -S.</p>

<p>-m, --move Move selected entities to CPU-LIST. Requires
-c and either -t or -q.</p>

<p>-p, --priority=[POLICY:]RTPRIO Set thread scheduler
tunables: POLICY and RTPRIO. POLICY is one of OTHER, FIFO,
RR, or BATCH. Requires -t.</p>

<p>-P, --show_threads Show thread list.</p>

<p>-s, --save=FILENAME Save kthreads sched tunables to
FILENAME.</p>

<p>-v, --version Show version</p>

<p>-W, --what_is Provides help about selected entities.
Requires -t.</p>

<p>-x, --spread Spread selected entities over CPU-LIST.
Requires at least one of -t or -q. The specified threads and
IRQs are each assigned to one cpu in CPU-LIST.</p>

<p>Modifiers</p>

<p>-c, --cpus=CPU-LIST CPU-LIST affected by commands.
Requires a CPU number or a comma- separated list of CPU
numbers.</p>

<p>-C, --affect_children Operation will affect children
threads.</p>

<p>-f, --filter Disable display of selected CPUs in --gui.
Requires -c</p>

<p>-G, --cgroup Display the processes with the type of
cgroups they are in. Requires -P</p>

<p>-K, --no_kthreads Operations will not affect kernel
threads.</p>

<p>-q, --irqs=IRQ-LIST IRQ-LIST affected by commands.
Requires an IRQ number or a comma-separated list of IRQ
numbers.</p>

<p>-S, --sockets=CPU-SOCKET-LIST CPU-SOCKET-LIST affected
by commands. Requires a socket number or a comma-separated
list of socket numbers.</p>

<p>-t, --threads=THREAD-LIST THREAD-LIST affected by
commands. Requires a thread number or thread name, or a
comma-separated list of thread numbers and/or names. Thread
names may contain wildcards. Be sure to quote or escape any
wildcard specifications.</p>

<p>-U, --no_uthreads Operations will not affect user
threads.</p>

<p>USAGE EXAMPLES If for instance the Ethernet NICs have
multiple queues for both receive and transmit, each with its
own IRQ, the Ethernet IRQs can be associ- ated with a CPU
socket:</p>

<p>tuna -S 2 -i -qeth*-x</p>

<p>Move everything off the CPUs in socket 2, then spread
the IRQs for the Ethernet devices acrross those same
CPUs.</p>
