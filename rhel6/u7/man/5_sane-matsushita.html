<p>sane-matsushita(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-matsushita(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-matsushita - SANE backend for Panasonic KV-SS
high speed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-matsushita library implements a
SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access
to some Panasonic KV-SS high speed scan- ners. This backend
is stable.</p>

<p>At present, the following scanners are known to work
with this backend:</p>

<p>Product id -------------- KV-SS25 KV-SS25D KV-SS55EX (*)
KV-S2025C (*) KV-S2045C (*) KV-S2065L (*)</p>

<p>(*) WARNING: None of the advanced options of these
scanners are avail- able (ie no color, no high resolution,
no automatic cropping). Basi- cally, the driver does no more
than what it does for the KV-SS25. I don t have access to
such scanners, and thus cannot add these options.</p>

<p>Other Panasonic high speed scanners may or may not work
with that back- end.</p>

<p>Valid command line options and their syntax can be
listed by using scanimage --help -d matsushita</p>

<p>Scan Mode</p>

<p>--mode selects the basic mode of operation of the
scanner.</p>

<p>--resolution selects the resolution for a scan. Each
model supports all or a subset of these resolutions: 100,
150, 200, 240, 300, 360, 400.</p>

<p>--duplex indicates whether to scan both side of the
sheet.</p>

<p>--feeder-mode selects the number of pages to scan (one
or until the tray is empty).</p>

<p>Geometry</p>

<p>--paper-size A4|...|Legal|Letter [A4] options selects
the area to scan. It adjust the -l -t -x -y options
accordingly. It does not need to be the real size of the
paper.</p>

<p>-l -t -x -y control the scan area: -l sets the top left
x coordinate, -t the top left y coordinate, -x selects the
width and -y the height of the scan area. All parameters are
specified in millimeters. It is possible to use the option
--paper-size instead.</p>

<p>Enhancement</p>

<p>--brightness controls the brightness of the acquired
image. The value varies from 1 to 255, or less, depending on
the scanner model.</p>

<p>--contrast controls the contrast of the acquired image.
Some models do not support that option.</p>

<p>--automatic-threshold automatically sets brightness,
contrast, white level, gamma, noise reduction and image
emphasis. These options are not avail- able when
automatic-threshold is in use.</p>

<p>--halftone-pattern option sets the tonal gradation for
the halftone mode. Pattern downloading is not implemented by
the backend.</p>

<p>--autoseparation provides automatic separation of text
and images.</p>

<p>--white-level option indicate the source of the white
base.</p>

<p>--noise-reduction reduces the isolated dot noise. This
option is not supported by all scanners.</p>

<p>--image-emphasis option sets the image emphasis. Some
selection are not available on all scanners.</p>

<p>--gamma options set the gamma curve. It is only valid
for Gray modes, and is not available on all scanners. Gamma
downloading is not implemented by the backend.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file
/etc/sane.d/matsushita.conf supports the device name to use
(eg /dev/scanner) and the SCSI option to auto-detect the
scanners supported.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib64/sane/libsane-matsushita.a The static
library implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-matsushita.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_MATSUSHITA If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for this backend. E.g., a
value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.
Smaller levels reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Memory in the KV-SS 25 The KV-SS 25 has not
enough internal memory to scan a whole A4 page in duplex
mode at high resolution. The frontend will return a memory
error in that case. Apparently, the KV-SS 25D has not that
problem.</p>

<p>Pattern and gamma downloading The scanner, with the
proper firmware, can download a halftone pattern and a gamma
table. This is not implemented.</p>

<p>Sub-areas The scanner can support up to 3 sub-areas on
each side to define some more precise enhancement options.
This is not implemented.</p>

<p>Duplex mode The backend does not support the setting of
different options for each side. The scan will occur with
the same options (halftone pattern, brightness, image
emphasis) for both sides.</p>

<p>SCANNING EXAMPLE To date, the only frontend capable of
using this scanner at full speed is scanadf.</p>

<p>A scanadf command line would be:</p>

<p>scanadf -d matsushita --output-file scan%04d.pbm
--start-count 0 --duplex --resolution 300
--feeder-mode=&quot;All pages&quot;
--paper-size=&quot;A4&quot;</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>
