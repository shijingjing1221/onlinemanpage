<p>LDAP_DELETE(3) LDAP_DELETE(3)</p>

<p>NAME ldap_delete, ldap_delete_s, ldap_delete_ext,
ldap_delete_ext_s - Per- form an LDAP delete operation.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ldap_delete_s(ld, dn) LDAP *ld; char *dn;</p>

<p>int ldap_delete(ld, dn) LDAP *ld; char *dn;</p>

<p>int ldap_delete_ext(ld, dn, serverctrls, clientctrls,
msgidp) LDAP *ld; char *dn; LDAPControl **serverctrls,
**clientctrls; int *msgidp;</p>

<p>int ldap_delete_ext_s(ld, dn, serverctrls, clientctrls)
LDAP *ld; char *dn; LDAPControl **serverctrls,
**clientctrls;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ldap_delete_s() routine is used to
perform an LDAP delete operation synchronously. It takes dn,
the DN of the entry to be deleted. It returns an LDAP error
code, indicating the success or failure of the
operation.</p>

<p>The ldap_delete() routine is used to perform an LDAP
delete operation asynchronously. It takes the same
parameters as ldap_delete_s(), but returns the message id of
the request it initiated. The result of the delete can be
obtained by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3).</p>

<p>The ldap_delete_ext() routine allows server and client
controls to be specified to extend the delete request. This
routine is asynchronous like ldap_delete(), but its return
value is an LDAP error code. It stores the message id of the
request in the integer pointed to by msgidp.</p>

<p>The ldap_delete_ext_s() routine is the synchronous
version of ldap_delete_ext(). It also returns an LDAP error
code indicating suc- cess or failure of the operation.</p>

<p>ERRORS ldap_delete_s() returns an LDAP error code which
can be interpreted by calling one of ldap_perror(3) and
friends. ldap_delete() returns -1 if something went wrong
initiating the request. It returns the non-nega- tive
message id of the request if things went ok.</p>

<p>ldap_delete_ext() and ldap_delete_ext_s() return some
Non-zero value if something went wrong initiating the
request, else return 0.</p>
