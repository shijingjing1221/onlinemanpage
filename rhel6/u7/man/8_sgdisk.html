<p>SGDISK(8) GPT fdisk Manual SGDISK(8)</p>

<p>NAME sgdisk - Command-line GUID partition table (GPT)
manipulator for Linux and Unix</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sgdisk [ options ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GPT fdisk is a text-mode menu-driven package
for creation and manipula- tion of partition tables. It
consists of two programs: the text-mode interactive gdisk
and the command-line sgdisk. Either program will
automatically convert an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR)
partition table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR
carrier partition to the newer Globally Unique Identifier
(GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a GUID
partition table. This man page documents the com- mand-line
sgdisk program.</p>

<p>Some advanced data manipulation and recovery options
require you to understand the distinctions between the main
and backup data, as well as between the GPT headers and the
partition tables. For information on MBR vs. GPT, as well as
GPT terminology and structure, see the extended gdisk
documentation at http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/ or consult
Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The sgdisk program employs a user interface thats based
entirely on the command line, making it suitable for use in
scripts or by experts who want to make one or two quick
changes to a disk. (The program may query the user when
certain errors are encountered, though.) The pro- gram s
name is based on sfdisk, but the user options of the two
pro- grams are entirely different from one another.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, sgdisk operates on disk device files, such
as /dev/sda or /dev/hda under Linux, /dev/disk0 under Mac OS
X, or /dev/ad0 or /dev/da0 under FreeBSD. The program can
also operate on disk image files, which can be either copies
of whole disks (made with dd, for instance) or raw disk
images used by emulators such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that
only raw disk images are supported; sgdisk cannot work on
compressed or other advanced disk image formats.</p>

<p>The MBR partitioning system uses a combination of
cylinder/head/sector (CHS) addressing and logical block
addressing (LBA). The former is klunky and limiting. GPT
drops CHS addressing and uses 64-bit LBA mode exclusively.
Thus, GPT data structures, and therefore sgdisk, do not need
to deal with CHS geometries and all the problems they
create.</p>

<p>For best results, you should use an OS-specific
partition table program whenever possible. For example, you
should make Mac OS X partitions with the Mac OS X Disk
Utility program and Linux partitions with the Linux gdisk,
sgdisk, or GNU Parted programs.</p>

<p>Upon start, sgdisk attempts to identify the partition
type in use on the disk. If it finds valid GPT data, sgdisk
will use it. If sgdisk finds a valid MBR or BSD disklabel
but no GPT data, it will attempt to convert the MBR or
disklabel into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are likely to have
unusable first and/or final partitions because they overlap
with the GPT data structures, though.) GPT fdisk can
identify, but not use data in, Apple Partition Map (APM)
disks, which are used on 680x0- and PowerPC-based
Macintoshes. If you specify any option that results in
changes to an MBR or BSD disklabel, sgdisk ignores those
changes unless the -g (--mbrtogpt), -z (--zap), or -Z
(--zap-all) option is used. If you use the -g option, sgdisk
replaces the MBR or disklabel with a GPT. This action is
potentially dangerous! Your system may become unbootable,
and partition type codes may become corrupted if the disk
uses unrecognized type codes. Boot problems are particularly
likely if youre multi-booting with any GPT-unaware OS.</p>

<p>The MBR-to-GPT conversion will leave at least one gap in
the partition numbering if the original MBR used logical
partitions. These gaps are harmless, but you can eliminate
them by using the -s (--sort) option, if you like. (Doing
this may require you to update your /etc/fstab file.)</p>

<p>When creating a fresh partition table, certain
considerations may be in order:</p>

<p>* For data (non-boot) disks, and for boot disks used on
BIOS-based computers with GRUB as the boot loader,
partitions may be cre- ated in whatever order and in
whatever sizes are desired.</p>

<p>* Boot disks for EFI-based systems require an EFI System
Partition (sgdisk internal code 0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32.
The recom- mended size of this partition is between 100 and
300 MiB. Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that GNU
Parted iden- tifies such partitions as having the &quot;boot
flag&quot; set.)</p>

<p>* Some boot loaders for BIOS-based systems make use of a
BIOS Boot Partition (sgdisk internal code 0xEF02), in which
the secondary boot loader is stored, possibly without the
benefit of a filesystem. This partition can typically be
quite small (roughly 32 to 200 KiB), but you should consult
your boot loader documen- tation for details.</p>

<p>* If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of
type Microsoft Reserved (sgdisk internal code 0x0C01) is
recommended. This partition should be about 128 MiB in size.
It ordinarily follows the EFI System Partition and
immediately precedes the Windows data partitions. (Note that
GNU Parted creates all FAT partitions as this type, which
actually makes the partition unusable for normal file
storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)</p>

<p>* Some OSes GPT utilities create some blank space
(typically 128 MiB) after each partition. The intent is to
enable future disk utilities to use this space. Such free
space is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may help
in future disk maintenance.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Some options take no arguments, others take one
argument (typically a partition number), and others take
compound arguments with colon delim- itation. For instance,
-n (--new) takes a partition number, a starting sector
number, and an ending sector number, as in sgdisk -n
2:2000:50000 /dev/sdc, which creates a new partition,
numbered 2, starting at sector 2000 an ending at sector
50,000, on /dev/sdc.</p>

<p>Unrelated options may be combined; however, some such
combinations will be nonsense (such as deleting a partition
and then changing its GUID type code). sgdisk interprets
options in the order in which theyre entered, so effects can
vary depending on order. For instance, sgdisk -s -d 2 sorts
the partition table entries and then deletes partition 2
from the newly-sorted list; but sgdisk -d 2 -s deletes the
original partition 2 and then sorts the modified partition
table.</p>

<p>Error checking and opportunities to correct mistakes in
sgdisk are min- imal. Although the program endeavors to keep
the GPT data structures legal, it does not prompt for
verification before performing its actions. Unless you
require a command-line-driven program, you should use the
interactive gdisk instead of sgdisk, since gdisk allows you
to quit without saving your changes, should you make a
mistake.</p>

<p>Although sgdisk is based on the same
partition-manipulation code as gdisk, sgdisk implements
fewer features than its interactive sibling. Options
available in sgdisk are:</p>

<p>-a, --set-alignment=value Set the sector alignment
multiple. GPT fdisk aligns the start of partitions to
sectors that are multiples of this value, which defaults to
2048 on freshly formatted disks. This alignment value is
necessary to obtain optimum performance with Western Digital
Advanced Format and similar drives with larger physical than
logical sector sizes, with some types of RAID arrays, and
with SSD devices.</p>

<p>-A,
--attributes=list|[partnum:show|or|nand|xor|=|set|clear|tog-
gle|get[:bitnum|hexbitmask]] View or set partition
attributes. Use list to see defined (known) attribute
values. Omit the partition number (and even the device
filename) when using this option. The others require a
partition number. The show and get options show the current
attribute settings (all attributes or for a particular bit,
respectively). The or, nand, xor, =, set, clear, and toggle
options enable you to change the attribute bit value. The
set, clear, toggle, and get options work on a bit number;
the others work on a hexadecimal bit mask. For example, type
sgdisk -A 4:set:2 /dev/sdc to set the bit 2 attribute
(legacy BIOS bootable) on partition 4 on /dev/sdc.</p>

<p>-b, --backup=file Save partition data to a backup file.
You can back up your cur- rent in-memory partition table to
a disk file using this option. The resulting file is a
binary file consisting of the protective MBR, the main GPT
header, the backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition
table, in that order. Note that the backup is of the current
in-memory data structures, so if you launch the pro- gram,
make changes, and then use this option, the backup will
reflect your changes. If the GPT data structures are
damaged, the backup may not accurately reflect the damaged
state; instead, they will reflect GPT fdisks first-pass
interpretation of the GPT.</p>

<p>-c, --change-name=partnum:name Change the GPT name of a
partition. This name is encoded as a UTF-16 string, but
proper entry and display of anything beyond basic ASCII
values requires suitable locale and font support. For the
most part, Linux ignores the partition name, but it may be
important in some OSes. If you want to set a name that
includes a space, enclose it in quotation marks, as in
sgdisk -c 1:&quot;Sample Name&quot; /dev/sdb. Note that the
GPT name of a partition is distinct from the filesystem
name, which is encoded in the filesystems data
structures.</p>

<p>-C, --recompute-chs Recompute CHS values in protective
or hybrid MBR. This option can sometimes help if a disk
utility, OS, or BIOS doesnt like the CHS values used by the
partitions in the protective or hybrid MBR. In particular,
the GPT specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for
over-8GiB partitions, but this value is technically illegal
by the usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they encounter
this value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS
value -- 0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, enabling these
BIOSes to boot.</p>

<p>-d, --delete=partnum Delete a partition. This action
deletes the entry from the par- tition table but does not
disturb the data within the sectors originally allocated to
the partition on the disk. If a corre- sponding hybrid MBR
partition exists, gdisk deletes it, as well, and expands any
adjacent 0xEE (EFI GPT) MBR protective partition to fill the
new free space.</p>

<p>-D, --display-alignment Display current sector alignment
value. Partitions will be cre- ated on multiples of the
sector value reported by this option. You can change the
alignment value with the -a option.</p>

<p>e, --move-second-header Move backup GPT data structures
to the end of the disk. Use this option if you ve added
disks to a RAID array, thus creating a virtual disk with
space that follows the backup GPT data struc- tures. This
command moves the backup GPT data structures to the end of
the disk, where they belong.</p>

<p>-E, --end-of-largest Displays the sector number of the
end of the largest available block of sectors on the disk. A
script may store this value and pass it back as part of -n s
option to create a partition. If no unallocated sectors are
available, this function returns the value 0.</p>

<p>-f, --first-in-largest Displays the sector number of the
start of the largest available block of sectors on the disk.
A script may store this value and pass it back as part of -n
s option to create a partition. If no unallocated sectors
are available, this function returns the value 0. Note that
this parameter is blind to partition align- ment; when you
actually create a partition, its start point might be
changed from this value.</p>

<p>-F, --first-aligned-in-largest Similar to -f
(--first-in-largest), except returns the sector number with
the current alignment correction applied. Use this function
if you need to compute the actual partition start point
rather than a theoretical start point or the actual start
point if you set the alignment value to 1.</p>

<p>-g, --mbrtogpt Convert an MBR or BSD disklabel disk to a
GPT disk. As a safety measure, use of this option is
required on MBR or BSD disklabel disks if you intend to save
your changes, in order to prevent accidentally damaging such
disks.</p>

<p>-G, --randomize-guids Randomize the disks GUID and all
partitions unique GUIDs (but not their partition type code
GUIDs). This function may be used after cloning a disk in
order to render all GUIDs once again unique.</p>

<p>-h, --hybrid Create a hybrid MBR. This option takes from
one to three parti- tion numbers, separated by colons, as
arguments. The created hybrid MBR places an EFI GPT (type
0xEE) partition first in the table, followed by the
partition(s) you specify. Their type codes are based on the
GPT fdisk type codes divided by 0x0100, which is usually
correct for Windows partitions. If the active/bootable flag
should be set, you must do so in another program, such as
fdisk. The gdisk program offers additional hybrid MBR
creation options.</p>

<p>-i, --info=partnum Show detailed partition information.
The summary information produced by the -p command
necessarily omits many details, such as the partitions
unique GUID and the translation of sgdisks internal
partition type code to a plain type name. The -i option
displays this information for a single partition.</p>

<p>-l, --load-backup=file Load partition data from a backup
file. This option is the reverse of the -b option. Note that
restoring partition data from anything but the original disk
is not recommended. This option will work even if the disk s
original partition table is bad; however, most other options
on the same command line will be ignored.</p>

<p>-L, --list-types Display a summary of partition types.
GPT uses a GUID to iden- tify partition types for particular
OSes and purposes. For ease of data entry, sgdisk compresses
these into two-byte (four-digit hexadecimal) values that are
related to their equivalent MBR codes. Specifically, the MBR
code is multiplied by hexadecimal 0x0100. For instance, the
code for Linux swap space in MBR is 0x82, and it s 0x8200 in
gdisk. A one-to-one correspondence is impossible, though.
Most notably, the codes for all varieties of FAT and NTFS
partition correspond to a single GPT code (entered as 0x0700
in sgdisk). Some OSes use a single MBR code but employ many
more codes in GPT. For these, sgdisk adds code numbers
sequentially, such as 0xa500 for a FreeBSD disklabel, 0xa501
for FreeBSD boot, 0xa502 for FreeBSD swap, and so on. Note
that these two-byte codes are unique to gdisk and sgdisk.
This option does not require you to specify a valid disk
device filename.</p>

<p>-m, --gpttombr Convert disk from GPT to MBR form. This
option takes from one to four partition numbers, separated
by colons, as arguments. Their type codes are based on the
GPT fdisk type codes divided by 0x0100. If the
active/bootable flag should be set, you must do so in
another program, such as fdisk. The gdisk program offers
additional MBR conversion options. It is not possible to
convert more than four partitions from GPT to MBR form or to
convert partitions that start above the 2TiB mark or that
are larger than 2TiB.</p>

<p>-n, --new=partnum:start:end Create a new partition. You
enter a partition number, starting sector, and an ending
sector. Both start and end sectors can be specified in
absolute terms as sector numbers or as positions measured in
kibibytes (K), mebibytes (M), gibibytes (G), tebibytes (T),
or pebibytes (P); for instance, 40M specifies a position
40MiB from the start of the disk. You can specify loca-
tions relative to the start or end of the specified default
range by preceding the number by a + or - symbol, as in +2G
to specify a point 2GiB after the default start sector, or
-200M to specify a point 200MiB before the last available
sector. A start or end value of 0 specifies the default
value, which is the start of the largest available block for
the start sector and the end of the same block for the end
sector. A partnum value of 0 causes the program to use the
first available parti- tion number. Subsequent uses of the
-A, -c, -t, and -u options may also use 0 to refer to the
same partition.</p>

<p>-N, --largest-new=num Create a new partition that fills
the largest available block of space on the disk. Note that
if used on a completely blank disk, this is likely to result
in a sector-moved warning, since the first available sector
(normally 34) doesnt fall on a 2048-sec- tor boundary (the
default for alignment). You can use the -a (--set-alignment)
option to adjust the alignment, if desired. A num value of 0
causes the program to use the first available partition
number.</p>

<p>-o, --clear Clear out all partition data. This includes
GPT header data, all partition definitions, and the
protective MBR. Note that this operation will, like most
other operations, fail on a damaged disk. If you want to
prepare a disk you know to be damaged for GPT use, you
should first wipe it with -Z and then partition it normally.
This option will work even if the disks original par- tition
table is bad; however, most other options on the same
command line will be ignored.</p>

<p>-p, --print Display basic partition summary data. This
includes partition numbers, starting and ending sector
numbers, partition sizes, sgdisks partition types codes, and
partition names. For addi- tional information, use the -i
(--info) option.</p>

<p>-P, --pretend Pretend to make specified changes.
In-memory GPT data structures are altered according to other
parameters, but changes are not written to disk.</p>

<p>-r, --transpose Swap two partitions entries in the
partition table. One or both partitions may be empty,
although swapping two empty partitions is pointless. For
instance, if partitions 1-4 are defined, transposing 1 and 5
results in a table with partitions numbered from 2-5.
Transposing partitions in this way has no effect on their
disk space allocation; it only alters their order in the
partition table.</p>

<p>-R, --replicate=second_device_filename Replicate the
main devices partition table on the specified second device.
Note that the replicated partition table is an exact copy,
including all GUIDs; if the device should have its own
unique GUIDs, you should use the -G option on the new
disk.</p>

<p>-s, --sort Sort partition entries. GPT partition numbers
need not match the order of partitions on the disk. If you
want them to match, you can use this option. Note that some
partitioning utilities sort partitions whenever they make
changes. Such changes will be reflected in your device
filenames, so you may need to edit /etc/fstab if you use
this option.</p>

<p>-t, --typecode=partnum:{hexcode|GUID} Change a single
partitions type code. You enter the type code using either a
two-byte hexadecimal number, as described ear- lier, or a
fully-specified GUID value, such as
EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7.</p>

<p>-T, --transform-bsd=partnum Transform BSD partitions
into GPT partitions. This option works on BSD disklabels
held within GPT (or converted MBR) partitions. Converted
partitions type codes are likely to need manual adjustment.
sgdisk will attempt to convert BSD disklabels stored on the
main disk when launched, but this conversion is likely to
produce first and/or last partitions that are unusable. The
many BSD variants means that the probability of sgdisk being
unable to convert a BSD disklabel is high compared to the
likelihood of problems with an MBR conversion.</p>

<p>-u, --partition-guid=partnum:guid Set the partition
unique GUID for an individual partition. The GUID may be a
complete GUID or R to set a random GUID.</p>

<p>-U, --disk-guid=guid Set the GUID for the disk. The GUID
may be a complete GUID or R to set a random GUID.</p>

<p>--usage Print a brief summary of available options.</p>

<p>-v, --verify Verify disk. This option checks for a
variety of problems, such as incorrect CRCs and mismatched
main and backup data. This option does not automatically
correct most problems, though; for that, you must use
options on the recovery &amp; transformation menu. If no
problems are found, this command displays a summary of
unallocated disk space. This option will work even if the
disk s original partition table is bad; however, most other
options on the same command line will be ignored.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display program version information. This
option may be used without specifying a device filename.</p>

<p>-z, --zap Zap (destroy) the GPT data structures and then
exit. Use this option if you want to repartition a GPT disk
using fdisk or some other GPT-unaware program. This option
destroys only the GPT data structures; it leaves the MBR
intact. This makes it useful for wiping out GPT data
structures after a disk has been repar- titioned for MBR
using a GPT-unaware utility; however, theres a risk that it
will damage boot loaders or even the start of the first or
end of the last MBR partition. If you use it on a valid GPT
disk, the MBR will be left with an inappropriate EFI GPT
(0xEE) partition definition, which you can delete using
another utility.</p>

<p>-Z, --zap-all Zap (destroy) the GPT and MBR data
structures and then exit. This option works much like -z,
but as it wipes the MBR as well as the GPT, it s more
suitable if you want to repartition a disk after using this
option, and completely unsuitable if youve already
repartitioned the disk.</p>

<p>-?, --help Print a summary of options.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES sgdisk returns various values depending on
its success or failure:</p>

<p>0 Normal program execution</p>

<p>1 Too few arguments</p>

<p>2 An error occurred while reading the partition
table</p>

<p>3 Non-GPT disk detected and no -g option</p>

<p>4 An error prevented saving changes</p>

<p>5 An error occurred while reading standard input (should
never occur with sgdisk, but may with gdisk)</p>

<p>8 Disk replication operation (-R) failed</p>

<p>BUGS As of March 2014 (version 0.8.10), sgdisk should be
considered beta software. Known bugs and limitations
include:</p>

<p>* The program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD,
and Mac OS X. Linux versions for x86-64 (64-bit), x86
(32-bit), and Pow- erPC (32-bit) have been tested, with the
x86-64 version having seen the most testing.</p>

<p>* The FreeBSD version of the program can t write changes
to the partition table to a disk when existing partitions on
that disk are mounted. (The same problem exists with many
other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.) This
limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p>* The fields used to display the start and end sector
numbers for partitions in the -p option are 14 characters
wide. This trans- lates to a limitation of about 45 PiB. On
larger disks, the dis- played columns will go out of
alignment.</p>

<p>* The program can load only up to 128 partitions (4
primary parti- tions and 124 logical partitions) when
converting from MBR for- mat. This limit can be raised by
changing the #define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in the basicmbr.h
source code file and recom- piling; however, such a change
will require using a larger-than-normal partition table.
(The limit of 128 partitions was chosen because that number
equals the 128 partitions sup- ported by the most common
partition table size.)</p>

<p>* Converting from MBR format sometimes fails because of
insuffi- cient space at the start or (more commonly) the end
of the disk. Resizing the partition table (using the s
option in the experts menu) can sometimes overcome this
problem; however, in extreme cases it may be necessary to
resize a partition using GNU Parted or a similar tool prior
to conversion with gdisk.</p>

<p>* MBR conversions work only if the disk has correct LBA
partition descriptors. These descriptors should be present
on any disk over 8 GiB in size or on smaller disks
partitioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p>* BSD disklabel support can create first and/or last
partitions that overlap with the GPT data structures. This
can sometimes be compensated by adjusting the partition
table size, but in extreme cases the affected partition(s)
may need to be deleted.</p>

<p>* Because of the highly variable nature of BSD disklabel
struc- tures, conversions from this form may be unreliable
-- parti- tions may be dropped, converted in a way that
creates overlaps with other partitions, or converted with
incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with
caution!</p>

<p>* Booting after converting an MBR or BSD disklabel disk
is likely to be disrupted. Sometimes re-installing a boot
loader will fix the problem, but other times you may need to
switch boot load- ers. Except on EFI-based platforms,
Windows through at least Windows 7 RC doesn t support
booting from GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the h
option on the recovery &amp; transforma- tion menu) or
abandoning GPT in favor of MBR may be your only options in
this case.</p>
