<p>KDEINIT4(8) KDE User s Manual KDEINIT4(8)</p>

<p>NAME kdeinit4 - Start all other KDE programs and kdeinit
loadable modules (KLMs).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kdeinit4 [--help] [--no-fork | --no-kded |
--suicide] [+programs | programs]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION kdeinit4 is a process launcher somewhat
similar to the famous init used for booting UNIX. It
executes KDE programs and kdeinit loadable modules (KLMs)
starting them more efficiently.</p>

<p>Using kdeinit4 to launch KDE applications makes starting
a typical KDE application a couple times faster and reduces
memory consumption by a substantial amount.</p>

<p>kdeinit4 is linked against all libraries a standard KDE
application needs. With this technique, starting an
application becomes much faster because now only the
application itself needs to be linked whereas oth- erwise
both the application as well as all the libaries it uses
need to be linked.</p>

<p>DISADVANTAGES The process name of applications started
via kdeinit4 is &quot;kdeinit4&quot;. This problem can be
corrected to a degree by changing the application name as
shown by ps. However, applications like killall will only
see kdeinit4 as the process name. To workaround this, use
kdekillall (from kdesdk/scripts) for applications started
via kdeinit4.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Show help about options</p>

<p>--no-fork Do not fork, i.e. do not exit until all the
executed programs ends</p>

<p>--no-kded Do not start kded</p>

<p>--suicide Terminate when no KDE applications are left
running</p>

<p>+programs runs the programs handling requests</p>

<p>programs runs the programs without handling requests</p>

<p>USAGE A standard way to run this program is by simply
specifying the follow- ing command at the prompt kdeinit4
program or kdeinit4 +program</p>

<p>FILES /tmp/kde-$USER/kdeinit4_$INSTANCE ...</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES $HOME Specifies the home directory
of the current user</p>

<p>$KDE_HOME_READONLY Specifies if the home directory of
the current user is read only</p>

<p>$KDE_IS_PRELINKED If set, tells kdeinit4 that the KDE
programs are pre-linked.</p>

<p>(Prelinking is a process that allows you to speed up the
process of dynamic linking.)</p>

<p>$KDE_DISPLAY If set, tells kdeinit4 that it is running
on a KDE desktop.</p>
