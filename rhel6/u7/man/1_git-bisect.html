<p>NAME git-bisect - Find by binary search the change that
introduced a bug</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git bisect &lt;subcommand&gt;
&lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The command takes various subcommands, and
different options depending on the subcommand:</p>

<p>git bisect help git bisect start [&lt;bad&gt;
[&lt;good&gt;...]] [--] [&lt;paths&gt;...] git bisect bad
[&lt;rev&gt;] git bisect good [&lt;rev&gt;...] git bisect
skip [(&lt;rev&gt;|&lt;range&gt;)...] git bisect reset
[&lt;commit&gt;] git bisect visualize git bisect replay
&lt;logfile&gt; git bisect log git bisect run
&lt;cmd&gt;...</p>

<p>This command uses git rev-list --bisect to help drive
the binary search process to find which change introduced a
bug, given an old &quot;good&quot; commit object name and a
later &quot;bad&quot; commit object name.</p>

<p>Getting help Use &quot;git bisect&quot; to get a short
usage description, and &quot;git bisect help&quot; or
&quot;git bisect -h&quot; to get a long usage
description.</p>

<p>Basic bisect commands: start, bad, good Using the Linux
kernel tree as an example, basic use of the bisect command
is as follows:</p>

<p>$ git bisect start $ git bisect bad # Current version is
bad $ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2 # v2.6.13-rc2 was the last
version # tested that was good</p>

<p>When you have specified at least one bad and one good
version, the command bisects the revision tree and outputs
something similar to the following:</p>

<p>Bisecting: 675 revisions left to test after this</p>

<p>The state in the middle of the set of revisions is then
checked out. You would now compile that kernel and boot it.
If the booted kernel works correctly, you would then issue
the following command:</p>

<p>$ git bisect good # this one is good</p>

<p>The output of this command would be something similar to
the following:</p>

<p>Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this</p>

<p>You keep repeating this process, compiling the tree,
testing it, and depending on whether it is good or bad
issuing the command &quot;git bisect good&quot; or &quot;git
bisect bad&quot; to ask for the next bisection.</p>

<p>Eventually there will be no more revisions left to
bisect, and you will have been left with the first bad
kernel revision in &quot;refs/bisect/bad&quot;.</p>

<p>Bisect reset After a bisect session, to clean up the
bisection state and return to the original HEAD, issue the
following command:</p>

<p>$ git bisect reset</p>

<p>By default, this will return your tree to the commit
that was checked out before git bisect start. (A new git
bisect start will also do that, as it cleans up the old
bisection state.)</p>

<p>With an optional argument, you can return to a different
commit instead:</p>

<p>$ git bisect reset &lt;commit&gt;</p>

<p>For example, git bisect reset HEAD will leave you on the
current bisection commit and avoid switching commits at all,
while git bisect reset bisect/bad will check out the first
bad revision.</p>

<p>Bisect visualize To see the currently remaining suspects
in gitk, issue the following command during the bisection
process:</p>

<p>$ git bisect visualize</p>

<p>view may also be used as a synonym for visualize.</p>

<p>If the DISPLAY environment variable is not set, git log
is used instead. You can also give command line options such
as -p and --stat.</p>

<p>$ git bisect view --stat</p>

<p>Bisect log and bisect replay After having marked
revisions as good or bad, issue the following command to
show what has been done so far:</p>

<p>$ git bisect log</p>

<p>If you discover that you made a mistake in specifying
the status of a revision, you can save the output of this
command to a file, edit it to remove the incorrect entries,
and then issue the following commands to return to a
corrected state:</p>

<p>$ git bisect reset $ git bisect replay that-file</p>

<p>Avoiding testing a commit If, in the middle of a bisect
session, you know that the next suggested revision is not a
good one to test (e.g. the change the commit introduces is
known not to work in your environment and you know it does
not have anything to do with the bug you are chasing), you
may want to find a nearby commit and try that instead.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>$ git bisect good/bad # previous round was good or bad.
Bisecting: 337 revisions left to test after this $ git
bisect visualize # oops, that is uninteresting. $ git reset
--hard HEAD~3 # try 3 revisions before what # was
suggested</p>

<p>Then compile and test the chosen revision, and
afterwards mark the revision as good or bad in the usual
manner.</p>

<p>Bisect skip Instead of choosing by yourself a nearby
commit, you can ask git to do it for you by issuing the
command:</p>

<p>$ git bisect skip # Current version cannot be tested</p>

<p>But git may eventually be unable to tell the first bad
commit among a bad commit and one or more skipped
commits.</p>

<p>You can even skip a range of commits, instead of just
one commit, using the
&quot;&lt;commit1&gt;..&lt;commit2&gt;&quot; notation. For
example:</p>

<p>$ git bisect skip v2.5..v2.6</p>

<p>This tells the bisect process that no commit after v2.5,
up to and including v2.6, should be tested.</p>

<p>Note that if you also want to skip the first commit of
the range you would issue the command:</p>

<p>$ git bisect skip v2.5 v2.5..v2.6</p>

<p>This tells the bisect process that the commits between
v2.5 included and v2.6 included should be skipped.</p>

<p>Cutting down bisection by giving more parameters to
bisect start You can further cut down the number of trials,
if you know what part of the tree is involved in the problem
you are tracking down, by specifying path parameters when
issuing the bisect start command:</p>

<p>$ git bisect start -- arch/i386 include/asm-i386</p>

<p>If you know beforehand more than one good commit, you
can narrow the bisect space down by specifying all of the
good commits immediately after the bad commit when issuing
the bisect start command:</p>

<p>$ git bisect start v2.6.20-rc6 v2.6.20-rc4 v2.6.20-rc1
-- # v2.6.20-rc6 is bad # v2.6.20-rc4 and v2.6.20-rc1 are
good</p>

<p>Bisect run If you have a script that can tell if the
current source code is good or bad, you can bisect by
issuing the command:</p>

<p>$ git bisect run my_script arguments</p>

<p>Note that the script (my_script in the above example)
should exit with code 0 if the current source code is good,
and exit with a code between 1 and 127 (inclusive), except
125, if the current source code is bad.</p>

<p>Any other exit code will abort the bisect process. It
should be noted that a program that terminates via
&quot;exit(-1)&quot; leaves $? = 255, (see the exit(3)
manual page), as the value is chopped with &quot;&amp;
0377&quot;.</p>

<p>The special exit code 125 should be used when the
current source code cannot be tested. If the script exits
with this code, the current revision will be skipped (see
git bisect skip above).</p>

<p>You may often find that during a bisect session you want
to have temporary modifications (e.g. s/#define DEBUG
0/#define DEBUG 1/ in a header file, or &quot;revision that
does not have this commit needs this patch applied to work
around another problem this bisection is not interested
in&quot;) applied to the revision being tested.</p>

<p>To cope with such a situation, after the inner git
bisect finds the next revision to test, the script can apply
the patch before compiling, run the real test, and
afterwards decide if the revision (possibly with the needed
patch) passed the test and then rewind the tree to the
pristine state. Finally the script should exit with the
status of the real test to let the &quot;git bisect
run&quot; command loop determine the eventual outcome of the
bisect session.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES &middot; Automatically bisect a broken build
between v1.2 and HEAD:</p>

<p>$ git bisect start HEAD v1.2 -- # HEAD is bad, v1.2 is
good $ git bisect run make # &quot;make&quot; builds the
app</p>

<p>&middot; Automatically bisect a test failure between
origin and HEAD:</p>

<p>$ git bisect start HEAD origin -- # HEAD is bad, origin
is good $ git bisect run make test # &quot;make test&quot;
builds and tests</p>

<p>&middot; Automatically bisect a broken test suite:</p>

<p>$ cat ~/test.sh #!/bin/sh make || exit 125 # this skips
broken builds make test # &quot;make test&quot; runs the
test suite $ git bisect start v1.3 v1.1 -- # v1.3 is bad,
v1.1 is good $ git bisect run ~/test.sh</p>

<p>Here we use a &quot;test.sh&quot; custom script. In this
script, if &quot;make&quot; fails, we skip the current
commit.</p>

<p>It is safer to use a custom script outside the
repository to prevent interactions between the bisect, make
and test processes and the script.</p>

<p>&quot;make test&quot; should &quot;exit 0&quot;, if the
test suite passes, and &quot;exit 1&quot; otherwise.</p>

<p>&middot; Automatically bisect a broken test case:</p>

<p>$ cat ~/test.sh #!/bin/sh make || exit 125 # this skips
broken builds ~/check_test_case.sh # does the test case
passes ? $ git bisect start HEAD HEAD~10 -- # culprit is
among the last 10 $ git bisect run ~/test.sh</p>

<p>Here &quot;check_test_case.sh&quot; should &quot;exit
0&quot; if the test case passes, and &quot;exit 1&quot;
otherwise.</p>

<p>It is safer if both &quot;test.sh&quot; and
&quot;check_test_case.sh&quot; scripts are outside the
repository to prevent interactions between the bisect, make
and test processes and the scripts.</p>

<p>&middot; Automatically bisect a broken test suite:</p>

<p>$ git bisect start HEAD HEAD~10 -- # culprit is among
the last 10 $ git bisect run sh -c &quot;make || exit 125;
~/check_test_case.sh&quot;</p>

<p>Does the same as the previous example, but on a single
line.</p>
