<p>NAME vfs_streams_xattr - Store alternate data streams in
posix xattrs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = streams_xattr</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_streams_xattr enables storing of NTFS alternate
data streams in the file system. As a normal posix file
system does not support the concept of multiple data streams
per file, the streams_xattr module stores the data in posix
extended attributes (xattrs). The name of these attributes
is user.DosStream.&quot;ADS-NAME&quot;.</p>

<p>The file system that is shared with this module enabled
must support xattrs.</p>

<p>Please note that most file systems have severe
limitations on the size of xattrs. So this module might work
for applications like IE that stores small zone information
in streams but will fail for applications that store serious
amounts of data in ADSs.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES [share] vfs objects = streams_xattr</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
