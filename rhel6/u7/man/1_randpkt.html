<p>NAME randpkt - Random Packet Generator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS randpkt [ -b &lt;maxbytes&gt; ] [ -c
&lt;count&gt; ] [ -t &lt;type&gt; ] &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION randpkt is a small utility that creates a
libpcap trace file full of random packets.</p>

<p>By creating many randomized packets of a certain type,
you can test packet sniffers to see how well they handle
malformed packets. The sniffer can never trust the data that
it sees in the packet because you can always sniff a very
bad packet that conforms to no standard. randpkt produces
very bad packets.</p>

<p>When creating packets of a certain type, randpkt uses a
sample packet that is stored internally to randpkt. It uses
this as the starting point for your random packets, and then
adds extra random bytes to the end of this sample
packet.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose to create random ARP packets,
randpkt will create a packet which contains a predetermined
Ethernet II header, with the Type field set to ARP. After
the Ethernet II header, it will put a random number of bytes
with random values.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b &lt;maxbytes&gt; Default 5000.</p>

<p>Defines the maximum number of bytes added to the sample
packet. If you choose a maxbytes value that is less than the
size of the sample packet, then your packets would contain
only the sample packet... not much variance there! randpkt
exits on that condition.</p>

<p>-c &lt;count&gt; Default 1000.</p>

<p>Defines the number of packets to generate.</p>

<p>-t &lt;type&gt; Default Ethernet II frame.</p>

<p>Defines the type of packet to generate:</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To see a description of the randpkt options
use:</p>

<p>randpkt</p>

<p>To generate a capture file with 1000 DNS packets
use:</p>

<p>randpkt -b 500 -t dns rand_dns.pcap</p>

<p>To generate a small capture file with just a single LLC
frame use:</p>

<p>randpkt -b 100 -c 1 -t llc single_llc.pcap</p>
