<p>NAME pamtompfont - Convert Netpbm image to Mplayer
bitmap font file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamtompfont [imagefile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamtompfont reads a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) and
converts it to an Mplayer bitmap font raster file.</p>

<p>This is the original font format used by Mplayer (for
subtitles, on- screen messages, etc.), before it had the
ability to use Freetype to access standard fonts.</p>

<p>The format was apparently an image format before Mplayer
adopted it for fonts, but I have no idea where it came from
or where else it might be used.</p>

<p>An Mplayer bitmap font consists of a font descriptor
file and raster files. The font descriptor file identifies
the raster files by file name. A raster file contains a
single rectangular raster image which contains an
arrangement of a bunch of glyphs. Each glyph is a rectan-
gular image and the font descriptor indicates where in the
image the glyph for each codepoint is. Every glyph in the
font has the same height, so the font descriptor just
indicates the file position in the raster file of the to
left corner of the glyph, and the width of the glyph in
pixels.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>HISTORY pamtompfont was added to Netpbm in Release 10.43
(June 2008).</p>
