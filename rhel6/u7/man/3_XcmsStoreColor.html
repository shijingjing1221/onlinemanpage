<p>XcmsStoreColor(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XcmsStoreColor(3)</p>

<p>NAME XcmsStoreColor, XcmsStoreColors - set colors</p>

<p>SYNTAX Status XcmsStoreColor(Display *display, Colormap
colormap, XcmsColor *color);</p>

<p>Status XcmsStoreColors(Display *display, Colormap
colormap, XcmsColor colors[], int ncolors, Bool
compression_flags_return[]);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>color Specifies the color cell and the color to store.
Values specified in this XcmsColor structure remain
unchanged on return.</p>

<p>colors Specifies the color specification array of
XcmsColor struc- tures, each specifying a color cell and the
color to store in that cell. Values specified in the array
remain unchanged upon return.</p>

<p>colormap Specifies the colormap.</p>

<p>compression_flags_return Returns an array of Boolean
values indicating compression status. If a non-NULL pointer
is supplied, each element of the array is set to True if the
corresponding color was com- pressed and False otherwise.
Pass NULL if the compression status is not useful.</p>

<p>ncolors Specifies the number of XcmsColor structures in
the color- specification array.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XcmsStoreColor function converts the
color specified in the Xcms- Color structure into RGB
values. It then uses this RGB specification in an XColor
structure, whose three flags (DoRed, DoGreen, and DoBlue)
are set, in a call to XStoreColor to change the color cell
specified by the pixel member of the XcmsColor structure.
This pixel value must be a valid index for the specified
colormap, and the color cell specified by the pixel value
must be a read/write cell. If the pixel value is not a valid
index, a BadValue error results. If the color cell is
unallocated or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess error
results. If the colormap is an installed map for its screen,
the changes are visi- ble immediately.</p>

<p>Note that XStoreColor has no return value; therefore, an
XcmsSuccess return value from this function indicates that
the conversion to RGB succeeded and the call to XStoreColor
was made. To obtain the actual color stored, use
XcmsQueryColor. Because of the screen s hardware limitations
or gamut compression, the color stored in the colormap may
not be identical to the color specified.</p>

<p>XcmsStoreColor can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XcmsStoreColors function converts the colors
specified in the array of XcmsColor structures into RGB
values and then uses these RGB speci- fications in XColor
structures, whose three flags (DoRed, DoGreen, and DoBlue)
are set, in a call to XStoreColors to change the color cells
specified by the pixel member of the corresponding XcmsColor
structure. Each pixel value must be a valid index for the
specified colormap, and the color cell specified by each
pixel value must be a read/write cell. If a pixel value is
not a valid index, a BadValue error results. If a color cell
is unallocated or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess error
results. If more than one pixel is in error, the one that
gets reported is arbitrary. If the colormap is an installed
map for its screen, the changes are visible immediately.</p>

<p>Note that XStoreColors has no return value; therefore,
an XcmsSuccess return value from this function indicates
that conversions to RGB suc- ceeded and the call to
XStoreColors was made. To obtain the actual colors stored,
use XcmsQueryColors. Because of the screen s hardware
limitations or gamut compression, the colors stored in the
colormap may not be identical to the colors specified.</p>

<p>XcmsStoreColors can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAccess A client attempted to free a color
map entry that it did not already allocate.</p>

<p>BadAccess A client attempted to store into a read-only
color map entry.</p>

<p>BadColor A value for a Colormap argument does not name a
defined Col- ormap.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
