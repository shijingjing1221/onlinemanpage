<p>ISGREATER(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
ISGREATER(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME isgreater - test if x greater than y</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>int isgreater(real-floating x, real-floating y);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The isgreater() macro shall determine
whether its first argument is greater than its second
argument. The value of isgreater( x, y) shall be equal to
(x) &gt; (y); however, unlike (x) &gt; (y), isgreater( x, y)
shall not raise the invalid floating-point exception when x
and y are unordered.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the isgreater()
macro shall return the value of (x) &gt; (y).</p>

<p>If x or y is NaN, 0 shall be returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The relational and equality operators
support the usual mathematical relationships between numeric
values. For any ordered pair of numeric values, exactly one
of the relationships (less, greater, and equal) is true.
Relational operators may raise the invalid floating-point
excep- tion when argument values are NaNs. For a NaN and a
numeric value, or for two NaNs, just the unordered
relationship is true. This macro is a quiet
(non-floating-point exception raising) version of a
relational operator. It facilitates writing efficient code
that accounts for NaNs without suffering the invalid
floating-point exception. In the SYNOPSIS section,
real-floating indicates that the argument shall be an
expres- sion of real-floating type.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
