<p>TCFLOW(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TCFLOW(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcflow - suspend or restart the transmission or
reception of data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;termios.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tcflow(int fildes, int action);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tcflow() function shall suspend or
restart transmission or recep- tion of data on the object
referred to by fildes, depending on the value of action. The
fildes argument is an open file descriptor associ- ated with
a terminal.</p>

<p>* If action is TCOOFF, output shall be suspended.</p>

<p>* If action is TCOON, suspended output shall be
restarted.</p>

<p>* If action is TCIOFF, the system shall transmit a STOP
character, which is intended to cause the terminal device to
stop transmitting data to the system.</p>

<p>* If action is TCION, the system shall transmit a START
character, which is intended to cause the terminal device to
start transmitting data to the system.</p>

<p>The default on the opening of a terminal file is that
neither its input nor its output are suspended.</p>

<p>Attempts to use tcflow() from a process which is a
member of a back- ground process group on a fildes
associated with its controlling termi- nal, shall cause the
process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling
process is blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process
shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is
sent.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcflow() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The action argument is not a supported value.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The file associated with fildes is not a
terminal.</p>

<p>The tcflow() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EIO The process group of the writing process is
orphaned, and the writing process is not ignoring or
blocking SIGTTOU.</p>
