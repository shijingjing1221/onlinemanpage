<p>ACCESS.CONF(5) Linux-PAM Manual ACCESS.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME access.conf - the login access control table
file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The /etc/security/access.conf file specifies
(user/group, host), (user/group, network/netmask) or
(user/group, tty) combinations for which a login will be
either accepted or refused.</p>

<p>When someone logs in, the file access.conf is scanned
for the first entry that matches the (user/group, host) or
(user/group, network/netmask) combination, or, in case of
non-networked logins, the first entry that matches the
(user/group, tty) combination. The permissions field of that
table entry determines whether the login will be accepted or
refused.</p>

<p>Each line of the login access control table has three
fields separated by a &quot;:&quot; character (colon):</p>

<p>permission:users/groups:origins</p>

<p>The first field, the permission field, can be either a
&quot;+&quot; character (plus) for access granted or a
&quot;-&quot; character (minus) for access denied.</p>

<p>The second field, the users/group field, should be a
list of one or more login names, group names, or ALL (which
always matches). To differentiate user entries from group
entries, group entries should be written with brackets, e.g.
(group).</p>

<p>The third field, the origins field, should be a list of
one or more tty names (for non-networked logins), host
names, domain names (begin with &quot;.&quot;), host
addresses, internet network numbers (end with
&quot;.&quot;), internet network addresses with network mask
(where network mask can be a decimal number or an internet
address also), ALL (which always matches) or LOCAL. LOCAL
keyword matches if and only if the PAM_RHOST is not set and
&lt;origin&gt; field is thus set from PAM_TTY or
PAM_SERVICE&quot;. If supported by the system you can use
@netgroupname in host or user patterns. The @@netgroupname
syntax is supported in the user pattern only and it makes
the local system hostname to be passed to the netgroup match
call in addition to the user name. This might not work
correctly on some libc implementations causing the match to
always fail.</p>

<p>The EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very
compact rules.</p>

<p>If the nodefgroup is not set, the group file is searched
when a name does not match that of the logged-in user. Only
groups are matched in which users are explicitly listed.
However the PAM module does not look at the primary group id
of a user.</p>

<p>The &quot;#&quot; character at start of line (no space
at front) can be used to mark this line as a comment
line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES These are some example lines which might be
specified in /etc/security/access.conf.</p>

<p>User root should be allowed to get access via cron, X11
terminal :0, tty1, ..., tty5, tty6.</p>

<p>+ : root : crond :0 tty1 tty2 tty3 tty4 tty5 tty6</p>

<p>User root should be allowed to get access from hosts
which own the IPv4 addresses. This does not mean that the
connection have to be a IPv4 one, a IPv6 connection from a
host with one of this IPv4 addresses does work, too.</p>

<p>+ : root : 192.168.200.1 192.168.200.4 192.168.200.9</p>

<p>+ : root : 127.0.0.1</p>

<p>User root should get access from network 192.168.201.
where the term will be evaluated by string matching. But it
might be better to use network/netmask instead. The same
meaning of 192.168.201. is 192.168.201.0/24 or
192.168.201.0/255.255.255.0.</p>

<p>+ : root : 192.168.201.</p>

<p>User root should be able to have access from hosts
foo1.bar.org and foo2.bar.org (uses string matching
also).</p>

<p>+ : root : foo1.bar.org foo2.bar.org</p>

<p>User root should be able to have access from domain
foo.bar.org (uses string matching also).</p>

<p>+ : root : .foo.bar.org</p>

<p>User root should be denied to get access from all other
sources.</p>

<p>- : root : ALL</p>

<p>User foo and members of netgroup admins should be
allowed to get access from all sources. This will only work
if netgroup service is available.</p>

<p>+ : @admins foo : ALL</p>

<p>User john and foo should get access from IPv6 host
address.</p>

<p>+ : john foo : 2001:db8:0:101::1</p>

<p>User john should get access from IPv6 net/mask.</p>

<p>+ : john : 2001:db8:0:101::/64</p>

<p>Disallow console logins to all but the shutdown, sync
and all other accounts, which are a member of the wheel
group.</p>

<p>-:ALL EXCEPT (wheel) shutdown sync:LOCAL</p>

<p>All other users should be denied to get access from all
sources.</p>

<p>- : ALL : ALL</p>

<p>AUTHORS Original login.access(5) manual was provided by
Guido van Rooij which was renamed to access.conf(5) to
reflect relation to default config file.</p>

<p>Network address / netmask description and example text
was introduced by Mike Becher
&lt;mike.becher@lrz-muenchen.de&gt;.</p>
