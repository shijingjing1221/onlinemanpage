<p>FSCANF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FSCANF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fscanf, scanf, sscanf - convert formatted input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fscanf(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict
format, ... ); int scanf(const char *restrict format, ... );
int sscanf(const char *restrict s, const char *restrict
format, ... );</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fscanf() function shall read from the
named input stream. The scanf() function shall read from the
standard input stream stdin. The sscanf() function shall
read from the string s. Each function reads bytes,
interprets them according to a format, and stores the
results in its arguments. Each expects, as arguments, a
control string format described below, and a set of pointer
arguments indicating where the converted input should be
stored. The result is undefined if there are insufficient
arguments for the format. If the format is exhausted while
arguments remain, the excess arguments shall be evaluated
but otherwise ignored.</p>

<p>Conversions can be applied to the nth argument after the
format in the argument list, rather than to the next unused
argument. In this case, the conversion specifier character %
(see below) is replaced by the sequence &quot;%n$&quot;,
where n is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}].
This feature provides for the definition of format strings
that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific
lan- guages. In format strings containing the
&quot;%n$&quot; form of conversion spec- ifications, it is
unspecified whether numbered arguments in the argu- ment
list can be referenced from the format string more than
once.</p>

<p>The format can contain either form of a conversion
specification-that is, % or &quot;%n$&quot;-but the two
forms cannot be mixed within a single format string. The
only exception to this is that %% or %* can be mixed with
the &quot;%n$&quot; form. When numbered argument
specifications are used, speci- fying the Nth argument
requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to
the ( N-1)th, are pointers.</p>

<p>The fscanf() function in all its forms shall allow
detection of a lan- guage-dependent radix character in the
input string. The radix charac- ter is defined in the
programs locale (category LC_NUMERIC ). In the POSIX locale,
or in a locale where the radix character is not defined, the
radix character shall default to a period (.).</p>

<p>The format is a character string, beginning and ending
in its initial shift state, if any, composed of zero or more
directives. Each direc- tive is composed of one of the
following: one or more white-space char- acters (
&lt;space&gt;s, &lt;tab&gt;s, &lt;newline&gt;s,
&lt;vertical-tab&gt;s, or &lt;form- feed&gt;s); an ordinary
character (neither%nor a white-space charac- ter); or a
conversion specification. Each conversion specification is
introduced by the character% or the character sequence
&quot;%n$&quot;, after which the following appear in
sequence:</p>

<p>* An optional assignment-suppressing character*.</p>

<p>* An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies
the maximum field width.</p>

<p>* An option length modifier that specifies the size of
the receiving object.</p>

<p>* A conversion specifier character that specifies the
type of conver- sion to be applied. The valid conversion
specifiers are described below.</p>

<p>The fscanf() functions shall execute each directive of
the format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below,
the function shall return. Failures are described as input
failures (due to the unavail- ability of input bytes) or
matching failures (due to inappropriate input).</p>

<p>A directive composed of one or more white-space
characters shall be executed by reading input until no more
valid input can be read, or up to the first byte which is
not a white-space character, which remains unread.</p>

<p>A directive that is an ordinary character shall be
executed as follows: the next byte shall be read from the
input and compared with the byte that comprises the
directive; if the comparison shows that they are not
equivalent, the directive shall fail, and the differing and
subsequent bytes shall remain unread. Similarly, if
end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a
character from being read, the direc- tive shall fail.</p>

<p>A directive that is a conversion specification defines a
set of match- ing input sequences, as described below for
each conversion character. A conversion specification shall
be executed in the following steps.</p>

<p>Input white-space characters (as specified by isspace())
shall be skipped, unless the conversion specification
includes a [, c, C, or n conversion specifier.</p>

<p>An item shall be read from the input, unless the
conversion specifica- tion includes an n conversion
specifier. An input item shall be defined as the longest
sequence of input bytes (up to any specified maximum field
width, which may be measured in characters or bytes
dependent on the conversion specifier) which is an initial
subsequence of a matching sequence. The first byte, if any,
after the input item shall remain unread. If the length of
the input item is 0, the execution of the con- version
specification shall fail; this condition is a matching
failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read
error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is
an input failure.</p>

<p>Except in the case of a % conversion specifier, the
input item (or, in the case of a %n conversion
specification, the count of input bytes) shall be converted
to a type appropriate to the conversion character. If the
input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the
con- version specification fails; this condition is a
matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was
indicated by a, the result of the conversion shall be placed
in the object pointed to by the first argu- ment following
the format argument that has not already received a con-
version result if the conversion specification is introduced
by %, or in the nth argument if introduced by the character
sequence &quot;%n$&quot;. If this object does not have an
appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot
be represented in the space provided, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>The length modifiers and their meanings are:</p>

<p>hh Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to signed char or unsigned char.</p>

<p>h Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to short or unsigned short.</p>

<p>l (ell) Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or
n conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to long or unsigned long; that a following a, A, e,
E, f, F, g, or G con- version specifier applies to an
argument with type pointer to double; or that a following c,
s, or [ conversion specifier applies to an argument with
type pointer to wchar_t.</p>

<p>ll (ell-ell)</p>

<p>Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to long long or unsigned long long.</p>

<p>j Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to intmax_t or uintmax_t.</p>

<p>z Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to size_t or the corresponding signed integer
type.</p>

<p>t Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to ptrdiff_t or the corresponding unsigned type.</p>

<p>L Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G
conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
pointer to long dou- ble.</p>

<p>If a length modifier appears with any conversion
specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>The following conversion specifiers are valid:</p>

<p>d Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose
format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of
strtol() with the value 10 for the base argument. In the
absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to int.</p>

<p>i Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is
the same as expected for the subject sequence of strtol()
with 0 for the base argument. In the absence of a size
modifier, the applica- tion shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to int.</p>

<p>o Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose
format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of
strtoul() with the value 8 for the base argument. In the
absence of a size modi- fier, the application shall ensure
that the corresponding argu- ment is a pointer to
unsigned.</p>

<p>u Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose
format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of
strtoul() with the value 10 for the base argument. In the
absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to
unsigned.</p>

<p>x Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer,
whose format is the same as expected for the subject
sequence of strtoul() with the value 16 for the base
argument. In the absence of a size modifier, the application
shall ensure that the correspond- ing argument is a pointer
to unsigned.</p>

<p>a, e, f, g</p>

<p>Matches an optionally signed floating-point number,
infinity, or NaN, whose format is the same as expected for
the subject sequence of strtod(). In the absence of a size
modifier, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to float.</p>

<p>If the fprintf() family of functions generates character
string repre- sentations for infinity and NaN (a symbolic
entity encoded in floating- point format) to support IEEE
Std 754-1985, the fscanf() family of functions shall
recognize them as input.</p>

<p>s Matches a sequence of bytes that are not white-space
characters. The application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to the initial byte of
an array of char, signed char, or unsigned char large enough
to accept the sequence and a ter- minating null character
code, which shall be added automati- cally.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the input is a
sequence of charac- ters that begins in the initial shift
state. Each character shall be converted to a wide character
as if by a call to the mbrtowc() func- tion, with the
conversion state described by an mbstate_t object ini-
tialized to zero before the first character is converted.
The applica- tion shall ensure that the corresponding
argument is a pointer to an array of wchar_t large enough to
accept the sequence and the terminat- ing null wide
character, which shall be added automatically.</p>

<p>[ Matches a non-empty sequence of bytes from a set of
expected bytes (the scanset). The normal skip over
white-space characters shall be suppressed in this case. The
application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is
a pointer to the initial byte of an array of char, signed
char, or unsigned char large enough to accept the sequence
and a terminating null byte, which shall be added
automatically.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the input is a
sequence of charac- ters that begins in the initial shift
state. Each character in the sequence shall be converted to
a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc() function,
with the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
initialized to zero before the first character is converted.
The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
is a pointer to an array of wchar_t large enough to accept
the sequence and the ter- minating null wide character,
which shall be added automatically.</p>

<p>The conversion specification includes all subsequent
bytes in the for- mat string up to and including the
matching right square bracket ( ] ). The bytes between the
square brackets (the scanlist) comprise the scanset, unless
the byte after the left square bracket is a circumflex ( ^
), in which case the scanset contains all bytes that do not
appear in the scanlist between the circumflex and the right
square bracket. If the conversion specification begins with
&quot;[]&quot; or &quot;[^]&quot;, the right square bracket
is included in the scanlist and the next right square
bracket is the matching right square bracket that ends the
con- version specification; otherwise, the first right
square bracket is the one that ends the conversion
specification. If a-is in the scanlist and is not the first
character, nor the second where the first charac- ter is a ^
, nor the last character, the behavior is implementation-
defined.</p>

<p>c Matches a sequence of bytes of the number specified by
the field width (1 if no field width is present in the
conversion specifi- cation). The application shall ensure
that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the initial
byte of an array of char, signed char, or unsigned char
large enough to accept the sequence. No null byte is added.
The normal skip over white- space characters shall be
suppressed in this case.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the input shall be a
sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift
state. Each character in the sequence is converted to a wide
character as if by a call to the mbrtowc() function, with
the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
initialized to zero before the first character is converted.
The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
is a pointer to an array of wchar_t large enough to accept
the resulting sequence of wide characters. No null wide
character is added.</p>

<p>p Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences,
which shall be the same as the set of sequences that is
produced by the %p conversion specification of the
corresponding fprintf() func- tions. The application shall
ensure that the corresponding argu- ment is a pointer to a
pointer to void. The interpretation of the input item is
implementation-defined. If the input item is a value
converted earlier during the same program execution, the
pointer that results shall compare equal to that value;
other- wise, the behavior of the %p conversion specification
is unde- fined.</p>

<p>n No input is consumed. The application shall ensure
that the cor- responding argument is a pointer to the
integer into which shall be written the number of bytes read
from the input so far by this call to the fscanf()
functions. Execution of a %n conver- sion specification
shall not increment the assignment count returned at the
completion of execution of the function. No argument shall
be converted, but one shall be consumed. If the conversion
specification includes an assignment-suppressing character
or a field width, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>C Equivalent to lc .</p>

<p>S Equivalent to ls .</p>

<p>% Matches a single% character; no conversion or
assignment occurs. The complete conversion specification
shall be %% .</p>

<p>If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior
is undefined.</p>

<p>The conversion specifiers A, E, F, G, and X are also
valid and shall be equivalent to a, e, f, g, and x,
respectively.</p>

<p>If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion
shall be termi- nated. If end-of-file occurs before any
bytes matching the current conversion specification (except
for %n ) have been read (other than leading white-space
characters, where permitted), execution of the cur- rent
conversion specification shall terminate with an input
failure. Otherwise, unless execution of the current
conversion specification is terminated with a matching
failure, execution of the following conver- sion
specification (if any) shall be terminated with an input
failure.</p>

<p>Reaching the end of the string in sscanf() shall be
equivalent to encountering end-of-file for fscanf().</p>

<p>If conversion terminates on a conflicting input, the
offending input is left unread in the input. Any trailing
white space (including &lt;newline&gt;s) shall be left
unread unless matched by a conversion speci- fication. The
success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is
only directly determinable via the %n conversion
specification.</p>

<p>The fscanf() and scanf() functions may mark the st_atime
field of the file associated with stream for update. The
st_atime field shall be marked for update by the first
successful execution of fgetc(), fgets(), fread(), getc(),
getchar(), gets(), fscanf(), or fscanf() using stream that
returns data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the number of successfully matched and assigned
input items; this number can be zero in the event of an
early matching failure. If the input ends before the first
matching failure or conversion, EOF shall be returned. If a
read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is
set, EOF shall be returned, and errno shall be set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS For the conditions under which the fscanf()
functions fail and may fail, refer to fgetc() or
fgetwc().</p>

<p>In addition, fscanf() may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ Input byte sequence does not form a valid
character.</p>

<p>EINVAL There are insufficient arguments.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The call:</p>

<p>int i, n; float x; char name[50]; n =
scanf(&quot;%d%f%s&quot;, &amp;i, &amp;x, name);</p>

<p>with the input line:</p>

<p>25 54.32E-1 Hamster</p>

<p>assigns to n the value 3, to i the value 25, to x the
value 5.432, and name contains the string
&quot;Hamster&quot; .</p>

<p>The call:</p>

<p>int i; float x; char name[50]; (void)
scanf(&quot;%2d%f%*d %[0123456789]&quot;, &amp;i, &amp;x,
name);</p>

<p>with input:</p>

<p>56789 0123 56a72</p>

<p>assigns 56 to i, 789.0 to x, skips 0123, and places the
string &quot;50&quot; in name. The next call to getchar()
shall return the charactera.</p>

<p>Reading Data into an Array The following call uses
fscanf() to read three floating-point numbers from standard
input into the input array.</p>

<p>float input[3]; fscanf (stdin, &quot;%f %f %f&quot;,
input, input+1, input+2);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the application calling fscanf()
has any objects of type wint_t or wchar_t, it must also
include the &lt;wchar.h&gt; header to have these objects
defined.</p>

<p>RATIONALE This function is aligned with the ISO/IEC
9899:1999 standard, and in doing so a few
&quot;obvious&quot; things were not included. Specifically,
the set of characters allowed in a scanset is limited to
single-byte char- acters. In other similar places,
multi-byte characters have been per- mitted, but for
alignment with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, it has not
been done here. Applications needing this could use the
correspond- ing wide-character functions to achieve the
desired results.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
