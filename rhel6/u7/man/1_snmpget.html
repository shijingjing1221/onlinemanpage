<p>SNMPGET(1) Net-SNMP SNMPGET(1)</p>

<p>NAME snmpget - communicates with a network entity using
SNMP GET requests</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpget [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] OID [OID]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the
SNMP GET request to query for information on a network
entity. One or more object identifiers (OIDs) may be given
as arguments on the command line. Each variable name is
given in the format specified in variables(5).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -Cf If -Cf is not specified, some applications
(snmpdelta, snmpget, snmpgetnext and snmpstatus) will try to
fix errors returned by the agent that you were talking to
and resend the request. The only time this is really useful
is if you specified a OID that didnt exist in your request
and you re using SNMPv1 which requires &quot;all or
nothing&quot; kinds of requests.</p>

<p>In addition to this option, snmpget REQUIRES options and
agent argu- ments, as described in the snmpcmd(1) manual
page.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The command:</p>

<p>snmpget -c public zeus system.sysDescr.0</p>

<p>will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0 from the
host zeus using the community string public :</p>

<p>system.sysDescr.0 = &quot;SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu
4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m&quot;</p>

<p>If the network entity has an error processing the
request packet, an error packet will be returned and a
message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what way the
request was malformed. If there were other variables in the
request, the request will be resent without the bad
variable.</p>

<p>Here is another example. The -c and -v options are
defined in the snm- pcmd(1) manual page. (Note that
system.sysUpTime is an incomplete OID, as it needs the .0
index appended to it):</p>

<p>snmpget -v1 -Cf -c public localhost system.sysUpTime
system.sysContact.0</p>

<p>This example will return the following:</p>

<p>Error in packet Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such
variable name in this MIB. This name doesnt exist:
system.sysUpTime</p>

<p>Similarly, the command: snmpget -v1 -c public localhost
system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0</p>

<p>Will return:</p>

<p>Error in packet Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such
variable name in this MIB. This name doesnt exist:
system.sysUpTime</p>

<p>system.sysContact.0 = STRING: root@localhost</p>

<p>With the -Cf flag specified the application will not try
to fix the PDU for you.</p>
