<p>GPG2(1) GNU Privacy Guard GPG2(1)</p>

<p>NAME gpg2 - OpenPGP encryption and signing tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpg2 [--homedir dir] [--options file] [options]
command [args]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gpg2 is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy
Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption
and signing services using the OpenPGP standard. gpg2
features complete key management and all bells and whis-
tles you can expect from a decent OpenPGP
implementation.</p>

<p>In contrast to the standalone version gpg, which is more
suited for server and embedded platforms, this version is
installed under the name gpg2 and more targeted to the
desktop as it requires several other mod- ules to be
installed. The standalone version will be kept maintained
and it is possible to install both versions on the same
system. If you need to use different configuration files,
you should make use of some- thing like gpg.conf-2 instead
of just gpg.conf.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The program returns 0 if everything was
fine, 1 if at least a signature was bad, and other error
codes for fatal errors.</p>

<p>WARNINGS Use a *good* password for your user account and
a *good* passphrase to protect your secret key. This
passphrase is the weakest part of the whole system. Programs
to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring are very
easy to write and so you should protect your
&quot;~/.gnupg/&quot; directory very well.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a
network (telnet), it is *very* easy to spy out your
passphrase!</p>

<p>If you are going to verify detached signatures, make
sure that the pro- gram knows about it; either give both
filenames on the command line or use &rsquo;-&rsquo; to
specify STDIN.</p>

<p>INTEROPERABILITY GnuPG tries to be a very flexible
implementation of the OpenPGP stan- dard. In particular,
GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of the standard,
such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2 compression
algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all OpenPGP
programs implement these optional algorithms and that by
forcing their use via the --cipher-algo, --digest-algo,
--cert-digest-algo, or --compress- algo options in GnuPG, it
is possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but
one that cannot be read by the intended recipient.</p>

<p>There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs
available, and each supports a slightly different subset of
these optional algorithms. For example, until recently, no
(unhacked) version of PGP supported the BLOWFISH cipher
algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be read
by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP
prefer- ences system that will always do the right thing and
create messages that are usable by all recipients,
regardless of which OpenPGP program they use. Only override
this safe default if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p>If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if
the preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason,
you are far better off using the --pgp6, --pgp7, or --pgp8
options. These options are safe as they do not force any
particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but rather
reduce the available algorithms to a &quot;PGP-safe&quot;
list.</p>

<p>COMMANDS Commands are not distinguished from options
except for the fact that only one command is allowed.</p>

<p>gpg2 may be run with no commands, in which case it will
perform a rea- sonable action depending on the type of file
it is given as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a
signature is verified, a file con- taining keys is
listed).</p>

<p>Please remember that option as well as command parsing
stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you can
explicitly stop parsing by using the special option --.</p>

<p>Commands not specific to the function</p>

<p>--version Print the program version and licensing
information. Note that you cannot abbreviate this
command.</p>

<p>--help</p>

<p>-h Print a usage message summarizing the most useful
command line options. Note that you cannot abbreviate this
command.</p>

<p>--warranty Print warranty information.</p>

<p>--dump-options Print a list of all available options and
commands. Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.</p>

<p>Commands to select the type of operation</p>

<p>--sign</p>

<p>-s Make a signature. This command may be combined with
--encrypt (for a signed and encrypted message), --symmetric
(for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), or
--encrypt and --symmet- ric together (for a signed message
that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase). The
key to be used for signing is chosen by default or can be
set with the --local-user and --default-key options.</p>

<p>--clearsign Make a clear text signature. The content in
a clear text signa- ture is readable without any special
software. OpenPGP software is only needed to verify the
signature. Clear text signatures may modify end-of-line
whitespace for platform independence and are not intended to
be reversible. The key to be used for sign- ing is chosen by
default or can be set with the --local-user and
--default-key options.</p>

<p>--detach-sign</p>

<p>-b Make a detached signature.</p>

<p>--encrypt</p>

<p>-e Encrypt data. This option may be combined with --sign
(for a signed and encrypted message), --symmetric (for a
message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a
passphrase), or --sign and --symmetric together (for a
signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a
passphrase).</p>

<p>--symmetric</p>

<p>-c Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.
The default symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be
chosen with the --cipher-algo option. This option may be
combined with --sign (for a signed and symmetrically
encrypted message), --encrypt (for a message that may be
decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or --sign and
--encrypt together (for a signed mes- sage that may be
decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).</p>

<p>--store Store only (make a simple RFC1991 literal data
packet).</p>

<p>--decrypt</p>

<p>-d Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN
if no file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file
specified with --output). If the decrypted file is signed,
the signature is also verified. This command differs from
the default operation, as it never writes to the filename
which is included in the file and it rejects files which
dont begin with an encrypted mes- sage.</p>

<p>--verify Assume that the first argument is a signed file
or a detached signature and verify it without generating any
output. With no arguments, the signature packet is read from
STDIN. If only a sigfile is given, it may be a complete
signature or a detached signature, in which case the signed
stuff is expected in a file without the &quot;.sig&quot; or
&quot;.asc&quot; extension. With more than 1 argu- ment, the
first should be a detached signature and the remaining files
are the signed stuff. To read the signed stuff from STDIN,
use &rsquo;-&rsquo; as the second filename. For security
reasons a detached signature cannot read the signed material
from STDIN without denoting it in the above way.</p>

<p>--multifile This modifies certain other commands to
accept multiple files for processing on the command line or
read from STDIN with each filename on a separate line. This
allows for many files to be processed at once. --multifile
may currently be used along with --verify, --encrypt, and
--decrypt. Note that --multifile --ver- ify may not be used
with detached signatures.</p>

<p>--verify-files Identical to --multifile --verify.</p>

<p>--encrypt-files Identical to --multifile --encrypt.</p>

<p>--decrypt-files Identical to --multifile --decrypt.</p>

<p>--list-keys</p>

<p>-k</p>

<p>--list-public-keys List all keys from the public
keyrings, or just the keys given on the command line.</p>

<p>Avoid using the output of this command in scripts or
other pro- grams as it is likely to change as GnuPG changes.
See --with- colons for a machine-parseable key listing
command that is appropriate for use in scripts and other
programs.</p>

<p>--list-secret-keys</p>

<p>-K List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the
ones given on the command line. A # after the letters sec
means that the secret key is not usable (for example, if it
was created via --export-secret-subkeys).</p>

<p>--list-sigs Same as --list-keys, but the signatures are
listed too. This command has the same effect as using
--list-keys with --with- sig-list.</p>

<p>For each signature listed, there are several flags in
between the &quot;sig&quot; tag and keyid. These flags give
additional information about each signature. From left to
right, they are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level
(see --ask-cert-level), &quot;L&quot; for a local or
non-exportable signature (see --lsign-key), &quot;R&quot;
for a nonRevocable signature (see the --edit-key command
&quot;nrsign&quot;), &quot;P&quot; for a signature that
contains a policy URL (see --cert-pol- icy-url),
&quot;N&quot; for a signature that contains a notation (see
--cert-notation), &quot;X&quot; for an eXpired signature
(see --ask-cert- expire), and the numbers 1-9 or
&quot;T&quot; for 10 and above to indicate trust signature
levels (see the --edit-key command &quot;tsign&quot;).</p>

<p>--check-sigs Same as --list-sigs, but the signatures are
verified. Note that for performance reasons the revocation
status of a signing key is not shown. This command has the
same effect as using --list- keys with --with-sig-check.</p>

<p>The status of the verification is indicated by a flag
directly following the &quot;sig&quot; tag (and thus before
the flags described above for --list-sigs). A &quot;!&quot;
indicates that the signature has been successfully verified,
a &quot;-&quot; denotes a bad signature and a &quot;%&quot;
is used if an error occurred while checking the signature
(e.g. a non supported algorithm).</p>

<p>--locate-keys Locate the keys given as arguments. This
command basically uses the same algorithm as used when
locating keys for encryption or signing and may thus be used
to see what keys gpg2 might use. In particular external
methods as defined by --auto-key-locate may be used to
locate a key. Only public keys are listed.</p>

<p>--fingerprint List all keys (or the specified ones)
along with their finger- prints. This is the same output as
--list-keys but with the additional output of a line with
the fingerprint. May also be combined with --list-sigs or
--check-sigs. If this command is given twice, the
fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too.</p>

<p>--list-packets List only the sequence of packets. This
is mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p>--card-edit Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The
subcommand &quot;help&quot; provides an overview on
available commands. For a detailed description, please see
the Card HOWTO at
http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO
.</p>

<p>--card-status Show the content of the smart card.</p>

<p>--change-pin Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of
a smartcard. This functionality is also available as the
subcommand &quot;passwd&quot; with the --card-edit
command.</p>

<p>--delete-key name Remove key from the public keyring. In
batch mode either --yes is required or the key must be
specified by fingerprint. This is a safeguard against
accidental deletion of multiple keys.</p>

<p>--delete-secret-key name Remove key from the secret and
public keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by
fingerprint.</p>

<p>--delete-secret-and-public-key name Same as
--delete-key, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed
first. In batch mode the key must be specified by fin-
gerprint.</p>

<p>--export Either export all keys from all keyrings
(default keyrings and those registered via option
--keyring), or if at least one name is given, those of the
given name. The new keyring is written to STDOUT or to the
file given with option --output. Use together with --armor
to mail those keys.</p>

<p>--send-keys key IDs Similar to --export but sends the
keys to a keyserver. Finger- prints may be used instead of
key IDs. Option --keyserver must be used to give the name of
this keyserver. Dont send your com- plete keyring to a
keyserver --- select only those keys which are new or
changed by you. If no key IDs are given, gpg does
nothing.</p>

<p>--export-secret-keys</p>

<p>--export-secret-subkeys Same as --export, but exports
the secret keys instead. This is normally not very useful
and a security risk. The second form of the command has the
special property to render the secret part of the primary
key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and other
implementations can not be expected to suc- cessfully import
such a key. See the option --simple-sk-check- sum if you
want to import such an exported key with an older OpenPGP
implementation.</p>

<p>--import</p>

<p>--fast-import Import/merge keys. This adds the given
keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently just a
synonym.</p>

<p>There are a few other options which control how this
command works. Most notable here is the --import-options
merge-only option which does not insert new keys but does
only the merging of new signatures, user-IDs and
subkeys.</p>

<p>--recv-keys key IDs Import the keys with the given key
IDs from a keyserver. Option --keyserver must be used to
give the name of this keyserver.</p>

<p>--refresh-keys Request updates from a keyserver for keys
that already exist on the local keyring. This is useful for
updating a key with the latest signatures, user IDs, etc.
Calling this with no arguments will refresh the entire
keyring. Option --keyserver must be used to give the name of
the keyserver for all keys that do not have preferred
keyservers set (see --keyserver-options honor-key-
server-url).</p>

<p>--search-keys names Search the keyserver for the given
names. Multiple names given here will be joined together to
create the search string for the keyserver. Option
--keyserver must be used to give the name of this keyserver.
Keyservers that support different search meth- ods allow
using the syntax specified in &quot;How to specify a user
ID&quot; below. Note that different keyserver types support
different search methods. Currently only LDAP supports them
all.</p>

<p>--fetch-keys URIs Retrieve keys located at the specified
URIs. Note that different installations of GnuPG may support
different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.)</p>

<p>--update-trustdb Do trust database maintenance. This
command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust.
This is an interactive command because it may have to ask
for the &quot;ownertrust&quot; values for keys. The user has
to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the
displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG
only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been
assigned to a key. Using the --edit-key menu, the assigned
value can be changed at any time.</p>

<p>--check-trustdb Do trust database maintenance without
user interaction. From time to time the trust database must
be updated so that expired keys or signatures and the
resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be tracked.
Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do
it automatically unless --no-auto-check-trustdb is set. This
command can be used to force a trust database check at any
time. The processing is identical to that of --update-
trustdb but it skips keys with a not yet defined
&quot;ownertrust&quot;.</p>

<p>For use with cron jobs, this command can be used
together with --batch in which case the trust database check
is done only if a check is needed. To force a run even in
batch mode add the option --yes.</p>

<p>--export-ownertrust Send the ownertrust values to
STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes as these values
are the only ones which cant be re- created from a corrupted
trustdb. Example: gpg2 --export-ownertrust &gt;
otrust.txt</p>

<p>--import-ownertrust Update the trustdb with the
ownertrust values stored in files (or STDIN if not given);
existing values will be overwritten. In case of a severely
damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of the
ownertrust values (e.g. in the file otrust.txt, you may
re-create the trustdb using these commands: cd ~/.gnupg rm
trustdb.gpg gpg2 --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt</p>

<p>--rebuild-keydb-caches When updating from version 1.0.6
to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create signature
caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other situations
too.</p>

<p>--print-md algo</p>

<p>--print-mds Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for
all given files or STDIN. With the second form (or a
deprecated &quot;*&quot; as algo) digests for all available
algorithms are printed.</p>

<p>--gen-random 0|1|2 Emit count random bytes of the given
quality level. If count is not given or zero, an endless
sequence of random bytes will be emitted. PLEASE, dont use
this command unless you know what you are doing; it may
remove precious entropy from the system!</p>

<p>--gen-prime mode bits Use the source, Luke :-). The
output format is still subject to change.</p>

<p>--enarmor</p>

<p>--dearmor Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an
OpenPGP ASCII armor. This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP
and in general not very useful.</p>

<p>How to manage your keys</p>

<p>This section explains the main commands for key
management</p>

<p>--gen-key Generate a new key pair. This command is
normally only used interactively.</p>

<p>There is an experimental feature which allows you to
create keys in batch mode. See the file doc/DETAILS in the
source distri- bution on how to use this.</p>

<p>--gen-revoke name Generate a revocation certificate for
the complete key. To revoke a subkey or a signature, use the
--edit command.</p>

<p>--desig-revoke name Generate a designated revocation
certificate for a key. This allows a user (with the
permission of the keyholder) to revoke someone elses
key.</p>

<p>--edit-key Present a menu which enables you to do most
of the key manage- ment related tasks. It expects the
specification of a key on the command line.</p>

<p>uid n Toggle selection of user ID or photographic user
ID with index n. Use * to select all and 0 to deselect
all.</p>

<p>key n Toggle selection of subkey with index n. Use * to
select all and 0 to deselect all.</p>

<p>sign Make a signature on key of user name If the key is
not yet signed by the default user (or the users given with
-u), the program displays the information of the key again,
together with its fingerprint and asks whether it should be
signed. This question is repeated for all users specified
with -u.</p>

<p>lsign Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is
marked as non- exportable and will therefore never be used
by others. This may be used to make keys valid only in the
local environment.</p>

<p>nrsign Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is
marked as non-revoca- ble and can therefore never be
revoked.</p>

<p>tsign Make a trust signature. This is a signature that
combines the notions of certification (like a regular
signature), and trust (like the &quot;trust&quot; command).
It is generally only useful in distinct communities or
groups.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;l&quot; (for local / non-exportable),
&quot;nr&quot; (for non-revo- cable, and &quot;t&quot; (for
trust) may be freely mixed and prefixed to &quot;sign&quot;
to create a signature of any type desired.</p>

<p>delsig Delete a signature. Note that it is not possible
to retract a signature, once it has been send to the public
(i.e. to a keyserver). In that case you better use
revsig.</p>

<p>revsig Revoke a signature. For every signature which has
been generated by one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether
a revocation certificate should be generated.</p>

<p>check Check the signatures on all selected user IDs.</p>

<p>adduid Create an additional user ID.</p>

<p>addphoto Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt
for a JPEG file that will be embedded into the user ID. Note
that a very large JPEG will make for a very large key. Also
note that some programs will display your JPEG unchanged
(GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to fit in a dialog
box (PGP).</p>

<p>showphoto Display the selected photographic user ID.</p>

<p>deluid Delete a user ID or photographic user ID. Note
that it is not possible to retract a user id, once it has
been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver). In that case
you better use revuid.</p>

<p>revuid Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID.</p>

<p>primary Flag the current user id as the primary one,
removes the primary user id flag from all other user ids and
sets the timestamp of all affected self-signatures one
second ahead. Note that setting a photo user ID as primary
makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a
regu- lar user ID as primary makes it primary over other
regu- lar user IDs.</p>

<p>keyserver Set a preferred keyserver for the specified
user ID(s). This allows other users to know where you prefer
they get your key from. See --keyserver-options
honor-keyserver- url for more on how this works. Setting a
value of &quot;none&quot; removes an existing preferred
keyserver.</p>

<p>notation Set a name=value notation for the specified
user ID(s). See --cert-notation for more on how this works.
Setting a value of &quot;none&quot; removes all notations,
setting a notation prefixed with a minus sign (-) removes
that notation, and setting a notation name (without the
=value) prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations
with that name.</p>

<p>pref List preferences from the selected user ID. This
shows the actual preferences, without including any implied
preferences.</p>

<p>showpref More verbose preferences listing for the
selected user ID. This shows the preferences in effect by
including the implied preferences of 3DES (cipher), SHA-1
(digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they are not
already included in the preference list. In addition, the
pre- ferred keyserver and signature notations (if any) are
shown.</p>

<p>setpref string Set the list of user ID preferences to
string for all (or just the selected) user IDs. Calling
setpref with no arguments sets the preference list to the
default (either built-in or set via
--default-preference-list), and call- ing setpref with
&quot;none&quot; as the argument sets an empty preference
list. Use gpg2 --version to get a list of available
algorithms. Note that while you can change the preferences
on an attribute user ID (aka &quot;photo ID&quot;), GnuPG
does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these
preferences will not be used by GnuPG.</p>

<p>When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms
in the order which youd like to see them used by someone
else when encrypting a message to your key. If you dont
include 3DES, it will be automatically added at the end.
Note that there are many factors that go into choosing an
algorithm (for example, your key may not be the only
recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being used
to send to you may or may not follow your exact cho- sen
order for a given message. It will, however, only choose an
algorithm that is present on the preference list of every
recipient key. See also the INTEROPERABIL- ITY WITH OTHER
OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.</p>

<p>addkey Add a subkey to this key.</p>

<p>addcardkey Generate a subkey on a card and add it to
this key.</p>

<p>keytocard Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the
primary key if no subkey has been selected) to a smartcard.
The secret key in the keyring will be replaced by a stub if
the key could be stored successfully on the card and you use
the save command later. Only certain key types may be
transferred to the card. A sub menu allows you to select on
what card to store the key. Note that it is not possi- ble
to get that key back from the card - if the card gets broken
your secret key will be lost unless you have a backup
somewhere.</p>

<p>bkuptocard file Restore the given file to a card. This
command may be used to restore a backup key (as generated
during card initialization) to a new card. In almost all
cases this will be the encryption key. You should use this
command only with the corresponding public key and make sure
that the file given as argument is indeed the backup to
restore. You should then select 2 to restore as encryp- tion
key. You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of the
backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the card.</p>

<p>delkey Remove a subkey (secondart key). Note that it is
not pos- sible to retract a subkey, once it has been send to
the public (i.e. to a keyserver). In that case you better
use revkey.</p>

<p>revkey Revoke a subkey.</p>

<p>expire Change the key or subkey expiration time. If a
subkey is selected, the expiration time of this subkey will
be changed. With no selection, the key expiration of the
primary key is changed.</p>

<p>trust Change the owner trust value for the key. This
updates the trust-db immediately and no save is
required.</p>

<p>disable</p>

<p>enable Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key
can not normally be used for encryption.</p>

<p>addrevoker Add a designated revoker to the key. This
takes one optional argument: &quot;sensitive&quot;. If a
designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will not be
exported by default (see export-options).</p>

<p>passwd Change the passphrase of the secret key.</p>

<p>toggle Toggle between public and secret key listing.</p>

<p>clean Compact (by removing all signatures except the
selfsig) any user ID that is no longer usable (e.g. revoked,
or expired). Then, remove any signatures that are not usable
by the trust calculations. Specifically, this removes any
signature that does not validate, any signature that is
superseded by a later signature, revoked signatures, and
signatures issued by keys that are not present on the
keyring.</p>

<p>minimize Make the key as small as possible. This removes
all sig- natures from each user ID except for the most
recent self-signature.</p>

<p>cross-certify Add cross-certification signatures to
signing subkeys that may not currently have them.
Cross-certification signatures protect against a subtle
attack against sign- ing subkeys. See
--require-cross-certification. All new keys generated have
this signature by default, so this option is only useful to
bring older keys up to date.</p>

<p>save Save all changes to the key rings and quit.</p>

<p>quit Quit the program without updating the key
rings.</p>

<p>The listing shows you the key with its secondary keys
and all user ids. Selected keys or user ids are indicated by
an aster- isk. The trust value is displayed with the primary
key: the first is the assigned owner trust and the second is
the calcu- lated trust value. Letters are used for the
values:</p>

<p>- No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated.</p>

<p>e Trust calculation has failed; probably due to an
expired key.</p>

<p>q Not enough information for calculation.</p>

<p>n Never trust this key.</p>

<p>m Marginally trusted.</p>

<p>f Fully trusted.</p>

<p>u Ultimately trusted.</p>

<p>--sign-key name Signs a public key with your secret key.
This is a shortcut ver- sion of the subcommand
&quot;sign&quot; from --edit.</p>

<p>--lsign-key name Signs a public key with your secret key
but marks it as non- exportable. This is a shortcut version
of the subcommand &quot;lsign&quot; from --edit-key.</p>

<p>OPTIONS gpg2 comes features a bunch of options to
control the exact behaviour and to change the default
configuration.</p>

<p>Long options can be put in an options file (default
&quot;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf&quot;). Short option names will not
work - for example, &quot;armor&quot; is a valid option for
the options file, while &quot;a&quot; is not. Do not write
the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any
required arguments. Lines with a hash (#) as the first
non-white- space character are ignored. Commands may be put
in this file too, but that is not generally useful as the
command will execute automatically with every execution of
gpg.</p>

<p>Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a
non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing
by using the special option --.</p>

<p>How to change the configuration</p>

<p>These options are used to change the configuration and
are usually found in the option file.</p>

<p>--default-key name Use name as the default key to sign
with. If this option is not used, the default key is the
first key found in the secret keyring. Note that -u or
--local-user overrides this option.</p>

<p>--default-recipient name Use name as default recipient
if option --recipient is not used and dont ask if this is a
valid one. name must be non-empty.</p>

<p>--default-recipient-self Use the default key as default
recipient if option --recipient is not used and dont ask if
this is a valid one. The default key is the first one from
the secret keyring or the one set with --default-key.</p>

<p>--no-default-recipient Reset --default-recipient and
--default-recipient-self.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Give more information during processing.
If used twice, the input data is listed in detail.</p>

<p>--no-verbose Reset verbose level to 0.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>--batch</p>

<p>--no-batch Use batch mode. Never ask, do not allow
interactive commands. --no-batch disables this option. Note
that even with a filename given on the command line, gpg
might still need to read from STDIN (in particular if gpg
figures that the input is a detached signature and no data
file has been specified). Thus if you do not want to feed
data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to /dev/null.</p>

<p>--no-tty Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used
for any output. This option is needed in some cases because
GnuPG sometimes prints warnings to the TTY even if --batch
is used.</p>

<p>--yes Assume &quot;yes&quot; on most questions.</p>

<p>--no Assume &quot;no&quot; on most questions.</p>

<p>--list-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options used when listing keys
and signatures (that is, --list-keys, --list-sigs,
--list-public-keys, --list-secret-keys, and the --edit-key
functions). Options can be prepended with a no- (after the
two dashes) to give the opposite meaning. The options
are:</p>

<p>show-photos Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs,
--list-public-keys, and --list-secret-keys to display any
photo IDs attached to the key. Defaults to no. See also
--photo-viewer.</p>

<p>show-policy-urls Show policy URLs in the --list-sigs or
--check-sigs list- ings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-notations</p>

<p>show-std-notations</p>

<p>show-user-notations Show all, IETF standard, or
user-defined signature nota- tions in the --list-sigs or
--check-sigs listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-keyserver-urls</p>

<p>Show any preferred keyserver URL in the --list-sigs or
--check-sigs listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-uid-validity Display the calculated validity of
user IDs during key listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-unusable-uids Show revoked and expired user IDs in
key listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-unusable-subkeys Show revoked and expired subkeys
in key listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-keyring Display the keyring name at the head of key
listings to show which keyring a given key resides on.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-sig-expire Show signature expiration dates (if any)
during --list- sigs or --check-sigs listings. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p>show-sig-subpackets Include signature subpackets in the
key listing. This option can take an optional argument list
of the subpackets to list. If no argument is passed, list
all subpackets. Defaults to no. This option is only meaning-
ful when using --with-colons along with --list-sigs or
--check-sigs.</p>

<p>--verify-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options used when verifying
signatures. Options can be prepended with a no- to give the
opposite meaning. The options are:</p>

<p>show-photos Display any photo IDs present on the key
that issued the signature. Defaults to no. See also
--photo-viewer.</p>

<p>show-policy-urls Show policy URLs in the signature being
verified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-notations</p>

<p>show-std-notations</p>

<p>show-user-notations Show all, IETF standard, or
user-defined signature nota- tions in the signature being
verified. Defaults to IETF standard.</p>

<p>show-keyserver-urls Show any preferred keyserver URL in
the signature being verified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-uid-validity Display the calculated validity of the
user IDs on the key that issued the signature. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p>show-unusable-uids Show revoked and expired user IDs
during signature veri- fication. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>show-primary-uid-only Show only the primary user ID
during signature verifica- tion. That is all the AKA lines
as well as photo Ids are not shown with the signature
verification status.</p>

<p>pka-lookups Enable PKA lookups to verify sender
addresses. Note that PKA is based on DNS, and so enabling
this option may dis- close information on when and what
signatures are veri- fied or to whom data is encrypted. This
is similar to the &quot;web bug&quot; described for the
auto-key-retrieve feature.</p>

<p>pka-trust-increase Raise the trust in a signature to
full if the signature passes PKA validation. This option is
only meaningful if pka-lookups is set.</p>

<p>--enable-dsa2</p>

<p>--disable-dsa2 Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys
even for old DSA Keys up to 1024 bit. This is also the
default with --openpgp. Note that older versions of GnuPG
also required this flag to allow the generation of DSA
larger than 1024 bit.</p>

<p>--photo-viewer string This is the command line that
should be run to view a photo ID. &quot;%i&quot; will be
expanded to a filename containing the photo. &quot;%I&quot;
does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the
viewer exits. Other flags are &quot;%k&quot; for the key ID,
&quot;%K&quot; for the long key ID, &quot;%f&quot; for the
key fingerprint, &quot;%t&quot; for the exten- sion of the
image type (e.g. &quot;jpg&quot;), &quot;%T&quot; for the
MIME type of the image (e.g. &quot;image/jpeg&quot;), and
&quot;%%&quot; for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or
%I are present, then the photo will be supplied to the
viewer on standard input.</p>

<p>The default viewer is &quot;xloadimage -fork -quiet
-title KeyID 0x%k STDIN&quot;. Note that if your image
viewer program is not secure, then executing it from GnuPG
does not make it secure.</p>

<p>--exec-path string Sets a list of directories to search
for photo viewers and key- server helpers. If not provided,
keyserver helpers use the com- piled-in default directory,
and photo viewers use the $PATH environment variable. Note,
that on W32 system this value is ignored when searching for
keyserver helpers.</p>

<p>--keyring file Add file to the current list of keyrings.
If file begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced
by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a
slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory
(&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not
used).</p>

<p>Note that this adds a keyring to the current list. If
the intent is to use the specified keyring alone, use
--keyring along with --no-default-keyring.</p>

<p>--secret-keyring file Same as --keyring but for the
secret keyrings.</p>

<p>--primary-keyring file Designate file as the primary
public keyring. This means that newly imported keys (via
--import or keyserver --recv-from) will go to this
keyring.</p>

<p>--trustdb-name file Use file instead of the default
trustdb. If file begins with a tilde and a slash, these are
replaced by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not
contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home
directory (~/.gnupg if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not
used).</p>

<p>--homedir dir Set the name of the home directory to dir.
If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to
~/.gnupg. It is only recognized when given on the command
line. It also overrides any home directory stated through
the environment variable GNUPGHOME or (on W32 systems) by
means of the Registry entry
HKCUSoftwareGNUGnuPG:HomeDir.</p>

<p>--display-charset name Set the name of the native
character set. This is used to con- vert some informational
strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding. Note
that this has nothing to do with the char- acter set of data
to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode
user-supplied data. If this option is not used, the default
character set is determined from the current locale. A
verbosity level of 3 shows the chosen set. Valid values for
name are:</p>

<p>iso-8859-1 This is the Latin 1 set.</p>

<p>iso-8859-2 The Latin 2 set.</p>

<p>iso-8859-15 This is currently an alias for the Latin 1
set.</p>

<p>koi8-r The usual Russian set (rfc1489).</p>

<p>utf-8 Bypass all translations and assume that the OS
uses native UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>--utf8-strings</p>

<p>--no-utf8-strings Assume that command line arguments are
given as UTF8 strings. The default (--no-utf8-strings) is to
assume that arguments are encoded in the character set as
specified by --display-charset. These options affect all
following arguments. Both options may be used multiple
times.</p>

<p>--options file Read options from file and do not try to
read them from the default options file in the homedir (see
--homedir). This option is ignored if used in an options
file.</p>

<p>--no-options Shortcut for --options /dev/null. This
option is detected before an attempt to open an option file.
Using this option will also prevent the creation of a
~/.gnupg homedir.</p>

<p>-z n</p>

<p>--compress-level n</p>

<p>--bzip2-compress-level n Set compression level to n for
the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms. The default is to
use the default compression level of zlib (normally 6).
--bzip2-compress-level sets the compres- sion level for the
BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This
is a different option from --compress-level since BZIP2 uses
a significant amount of memory for each additional
compression level. -z sets both. A value of 0 for n disables
compression.</p>

<p>--bzip2-decompress-lowmem Use a different decompression
method for BZIP2 compressed files. This alternate method
uses a bit more than half the memory, but also runs at half
the speed. This is useful under extreme low memory
circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a
high --bzip2-compress-level.</p>

<p>--mangle-dos-filenames</p>

<p>--no-mangle-dos-filenames Older version of Windows
cannot handle filenames with more than one dot.
--mangle-dos-filenames causes GnuPG to replace (rather than
add to) the extension of an output filename to avoid this
problem. This option is off by default and has no effect on
non- Windows platforms.</p>

<p>--ask-cert-level</p>

<p>--no-ask-cert-level When making a key signature, prompt
for a certification level. If this option is not specified,
the certification level used is set via
--default-cert-level. See --default-cert-level for
information on the specific levels and how they are used.
--no- ask-cert-level disables this option. This option
defaults to no.</p>

<p>--default-cert-level n The default to use for the check
level when signing a key.</p>

<p>0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully
you verified the key.</p>

<p>1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who
claims to own it but you could not, or did not verify the
key at all. This is useful for a &quot;persona&quot;
verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous
user.</p>

<p>2 means you did casual verification of the key. For
example, this could mean that you verified that the key
fingerprint and checked the user ID on the key against a
photo ID.</p>

<p>3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For
example, this could mean that you verified the key
fingerprint with the owner of the key in person, and that
you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner
matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally that
you verified (by exchange of email) that the email address
on the key belongs to the key owner.</p>

<p>Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3
are just that: examples. In the end, it is up to you to
decide just what &quot;casual&quot; and
&quot;extensive&quot; mean to you.</p>

<p>This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).</p>

<p>--min-cert-level When building the trust database, treat
any signatures with a certification level below this as
invalid. Defaults to 2, which disregards level 1 signatures.
Note that level 0 &quot;no particular claim&quot; signatures
are always accepted.</p>

<p>--trusted-key long key ID Assume that the specified key
(which must be given as a full 8 byte key ID) is as
trustworthy as one of your own secret keys. This option is
useful if you dont want to keep your secret keys (or one of
them) online but still want to be able to check the validity
of a given recipients or signators key.</p>

<p>--trust-model pgp|classic|direct|always|auto Set what
trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are:</p>

<p>pgp This is the Web of Trust combined with trust
signatures as used in PGP 5.x and later. This is the default
trust model when creating a new trust database.</p>

<p>classic This is the standard Web of Trust as used in PGP
2.x and earlier.</p>

<p>direct Key validity is set directly by the user and not
calcu- lated via the Web of Trust.</p>

<p>always Skip key validation and assume that used keys are
always fully trusted. You generally wont use this unless you
are using some external validation scheme. This option also
suppresses the &quot;[uncertain]&quot; tag printed with
signa- ture checks when there is no evidence that the user
ID is bound to the key.</p>

<p>auto Select the trust model depending on whatever the
internal trust database says. This is the default model if
such a database already exists.</p>

<p>--auto-key-locate parameters</p>

<p>--no-auto-key-locate GnuPG can automatically locate and
retrieve keys as needed using this option. This happens when
encrypting to an email address (in the
&quot;user@example.com&quot; form), and there are no
user@exam- ple.com keys on the local keyring. This option
takes any number of the following mechanisms, in the order
they are to be tried:</p>

<p>cert Locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in
rfc4398.</p>

<p>pka Locate a key using DNS PKA.</p>

<p>ldap Using DNS Service Discovery, check the domain in
question for any LDAP keyservers to use. If this fails,
attempt to locate the key using the PGP Universal method of
checking &rsquo;ldap://keys.(thedomain)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>keyserver Locate a key using whatever keyserver is
defined using the --keyserver option.</p>

<p>keyserver-URL In addition, a keyserver URL as used in
the --keyserver option may be used here to query that
particular key- server.</p>

<p>local Locate the key using the local keyrings. This
mechanism allows to select the order a local key lookup is
done. Thus using &rsquo;--auto-key-locate local&rsquo; is
identical to --no-auto-key-locate.</p>

<p>nodefault This flag disables the standard local key
lookup, done before any of the mechanisms defined by the
--auto-key- locate are tried. The position of this mechanism
in the list does not matter. It is not required if local is
also used.</p>

<p>--keyid-format short|0xshort|long|0xlong Select how to
display key IDs. &quot;short&quot; is the traditional
8-character key ID. &quot;long&quot; is the more accurate
(but less convenient) 16-character key ID. Add an
&quot;0x&quot; to either to include an &quot;0x&quot; at the
beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560.</p>

<p>--keyserver name Use name as your keyserver. This is the
server that --recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and
search for keys on. The format of the name is a URI:
scheme:[//]keyservername[:port] The scheme is the type of
keyserver: &quot;hkp&quot; for the HTTP (or compatible)
keyservers, &quot;ldap&quot; for the LDAP keyservers, or
&quot;mailto&quot; for the Graff email keyserver. Note that
your particular installation of GnuPG may have other
keyserver types available as well. Key- server schemes are
case-insensitive. After the keyserver name, optional
keyserver configuration options may be provided. These are
the same as the global --keyserver-options from below, but
apply only to this particular keyserver.</p>

<p>Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is
gener- ally no need to send keys to more than one server.
The keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net uses round robin DNS to
give a different keyserver each time you use it.</p>

<p>--keyserver-options name=value1 This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for the keyserver.
Options can be prefixed with a no- to give the opposite
meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may be used
here as well to apply to importing (--recv-key) or export-
ing (--send-key) a key from a keyserver. While not all
options are available for all keyserver types, some common
options are:</p>

<p>include-revoked When searching for a key with
--search-keys, include keys that are marked on the keyserver
as revoked. Note that not all keyservers differentiate
between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such keyservers
this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers
do not have cryptographic verification of key revocations,
and so turning this option off may result in skipping keys
that are incorrectly marked as revoked.</p>

<p>include-disabled When searching for a key with
--search-keys, include keys that are marked on the keyserver
as disabled. Note that this option is not used with HKP
keyservers.</p>

<p>auto-key-retrieve This option enables the automatic
retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying
signatures made by keys that are not on the local
keyring.</p>

<p>Note that this option makes a &quot;web bug&quot; like
behavior possible. Keyserver operators can see which keys
you request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand
new key (which you naturally will not have on your local
keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and the
time when you verified the signature.</p>

<p>honor-keyserver-url When using --refresh-keys, if the
key in question has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that
preferred key- server to refresh the key from. In addition,
if auto-key- retrieve is set, and the signature being
verified has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that
preferred key- server to fetch the key from. Defaults to
yes.</p>

<p>honor-pka-record If auto-key-retrieve is set, and the
signature being ver- ified has a PKA record, then use the
PKA information to fetch the key. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p>include-subkeys When receiving a key, include subkeys as
potential tar- gets. Note that this option is not used with
HKP key- servers, as they do not support retrieving keys by
subkey id.</p>

<p>use-temp-files On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG
communicates with the keyserver helper program via pipes,
which is the most efficient method. This option forces GnuPG
to use tempo- rary files to communicate. On some platforms
(such as Win32 and RISC OS), this option is always
enabled.</p>

<p>keep-temp-files If using use-temp-files, do not delete
the temp files after using them. This option is useful to
learn the key- server communication protocol by reading the
temporary files.</p>

<p>verbose Tell the keyserver helper program to be more
verbose. This option can be repeated multiple times to
increase the verbosity level.</p>

<p>timeout Tell the keyserver helper program how long (in
seconds) to try and perform a keyserver action before giving
up. Note that performing multiple actions at the same time
uses this timeout value per action. For example, when
retrieving multiple keys via --recv-keys, the timeout
applies separately to each key retrieval, and not to the
--recv-keys command as a whole. Defaults to 30 seconds.</p>

<p>http-proxy=value Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP
keyservers. This overrides the &quot;http_proxy&quot;
environment variable, if any.</p>

<p>max-cert-size When retrieving a key via DNS CERT, only
accept keys up to this size. Defaults to 16384 bytes.</p>

<p>debug Turn on debug output in the keyserver helper
program. Note that the details of debug output depends on
which keyserver helper program is being used, and in turn,
on any libraries that the keyserver helper program uses
internally (libcurl, openldap, etc).</p>

<p>check-cert Enable certificate checking if the keyserver
presents one (for hkps or ldaps). Defaults to on.</p>

<p>ca-cert-file Provide a certificate file to override the
system default. Only necessary if check-cert is enabled, and
the keyserver is using a certificate that is not present in
a system default certificate list.</p>

<p>--completes-needed n Number of completely trusted users
to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 1).</p>

<p>--marginals-needed n Number of marginally trusted users
to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 3)</p>

<p>--max-cert-depth n Maximum depth of a certification
chain (default is 5).</p>

<p>--simple-sk-checksum Secret keys are integrity protected
by using a SHA-1 checksum. This method is part of the
upcoming enhanced OpenPGP specifica- tion but GnuPG already
uses it as a countermeasure against cer- tain attacks. Old
applications dont understand this new for- mat, so this
option may be used to switch back to the old behaviour.
Using this option bears a security risk. Note that using
this option only takes effect when the secret key is
encrypted - the simplest way to make this happen is to
change the passphrase on the key (even changing it to the
same value is acceptable).</p>

<p>--no-sig-cache Do not cache the verification status of
key signatures. Caching gives a much better performance in
key listings. However, if you suspect that your public
keyring is not save against write modi- fications, you can
use this option to disable the caching. It probably does not
make sense to disable it because all kind of damage can be
done if someone else has write access to your pub- lic
keyring.</p>

<p>--no-sig-create-check GnuPG normally verifies each
signature right after creation to protect against bugs and
hardware malfunctions which could leak out bits from the
secret key. This extra verification needs some time (about
115% for DSA keys), and so this option can be used to
disable it. However, due to the fact that the signature cre-
ation needs manual interaction, this performance penalty
does not matter in most settings.</p>

<p>--auto-check-trustdb</p>

<p>--no-auto-check-trustdb If GnuPG feels that its
information about the Web of Trust has to be updated, it
automatically runs the --check-trustdb command internally.
This may be a time consuming process. --no-auto-
check-trustdb disables this option.</p>

<p>--use-agent</p>

<p>--no-use-agent This is dummy option. gpg2 always
requires the agent.</p>

<p>--gpg-agent-info This is dummy option. It has no effect
when used with gpg2.</p>

<p>--lock-once Lock the databases the first time a lock is
requested and do not release the lock until the process
terminates.</p>

<p>--lock-multiple Release the locks every time a lock is
no longer needed. Use this to override a previous
--lock-once from a config file.</p>

<p>--lock-never Disable locking entirely. This option
should be used only in very special environments, where it
can be assured that only one process is accessing those
files. A bootable floppy with a stand-alone encryption
system will probably use this. Improper usage of this option
may lead to data and key corruption.</p>

<p>--exit-on-status-write-error This option will cause
write errors on the status FD to immedi- ately terminate the
process. That should in fact be the default but it never
worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this,
so that the change won t break applications which close
their end of a status fd connected pipe too early. Using
this option along with --enable-progress-filter may be used
to cleanly cancel long running gpg operations.</p>

<p>--limit-card-insert-tries n With n greater than 0 the
number of prompts asking to insert a smartcard gets limited
to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg wont at all ask to insert
a card if none has been inserted at startup. This option is
useful in the configuration file in case an application does
not know about the smartcard support and waits ad infinitum
for an inserted card.</p>

<p>--no-random-seed-file GnuPG uses a file to store its
internal random pool over invoca- tions. This makes random
generation faster; however sometimes write operations are
not desired. This option can be used to achieve that with
the cost of slower random generation.</p>

<p>--no-greeting Suppress the initial copyright
message.</p>

<p>--no-secmem-warning Suppress the warning about
&quot;using insecure memory&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-permission-warning Suppress the warning about
unsafe file and home directory (--homedir) permissions. Note
that the permission checks that GnuPG performs are not
intended to be authoritative, but rather they simply warn
about certain common permission problems. Do not assume that
the lack of a warning means that your system is secure.</p>

<p>Note that the warning for unsafe --homedir permissions
cannot be suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would
allow an attacker to place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place,
and use this file to suppress warnings about itself. The
--homedir permissions warn- ing may only be suppressed on
the command line.</p>

<p>--no-mdc-warning Suppress the warning about missing MDC
integrity protection.</p>

<p>--require-secmem</p>

<p>--no-require-secmem Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get
secure memory. Defaults to no (i.e. run, but give a
warning).</p>

<p>--require-cross-certification</p>

<p>--no-require-cross-certification When verifying a
signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross
certification &quot;back signature&quot; on the subkey is
present and valid. This protects against a subtle attack
against sub- keys that can sign. Defaults to
--require-cross-certification for gpg2.</p>

<p>--expert</p>

<p>--no-expert Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or
&quot;silly&quot; things like signing an expired or revoked
key, or certain potentially incom- patible things like
generating unusual key types. This also dis- ables certain
warning messages about potentially incompatible actions. As
the name implies, this option is for experts only. If you
dont fully understand the implications of what it allows you
to do, leave this off. --no-expert disables this option.</p>

<p>Key related options</p>

<p>--recipient name</p>

<p>-r Encrypt for user id name. If this option or
--hidden-recipient is not specified, GnuPG asks for the
user-id unless --default- recipient is given.</p>

<p>--hidden-recipient name</p>

<p>-R Encrypt for user ID name, but hide the key ID of this
users key. This option helps to hide the receiver of the
message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic
analysis. If this option or --recipient is not specified,
GnuPG asks for the user ID unless --default-recipient is
given.</p>

<p>--encrypt-to name Same as --recipient but this one is
intended for use in the options file and may be used with
your own user-id as an &quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These
keys are only used when there are other recipients given
either by use of --recipient or by the asked user id. No
trust checking is performed for these user ids and even
disabled keys can be used.</p>

<p>--hidden-encrypt-to name Same as --hidden-recipient but
this one is intended for use in the options file and may be
used with your own user-id as a hid- den
&quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These keys are only used when
there are other recipients given either by use of
--recipient or by the asked user id. No trust checking is
performed for these user ids and even disabled keys can be
used.</p>

<p>--no-encrypt-to Disable the use of all --encrypt-to and
--hidden-encrypt-to keys.</p>

<p>--group name=value1 Sets up a named group, which is
similar to aliases in email pro- grams. Any time the group
name is a recipient (-r or --recipi- ent), it will be
expanded to the values specified. Multiple groups with the
same name are automatically merged into a single group.</p>

<p>The values are key IDs or fingerprints, but any key
description is accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it
will be treated as two different values. Note also there is
only one level of expansion --- you cannot make an group
that points to another group. When used from the command
line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to this
option to prevent the shell from treating it as multiple
arguments.</p>

<p>--ungroup name Remove a given entry from the --group
list.</p>

<p>--no-groups Remove all entries from the --group
list.</p>

<p>--local-user name</p>

<p>-u Use name as the key to sign with. Note that this
option over- rides --default-key.</p>

<p>--try-all-secrets Dont look at the key ID as stored in
the message but try all secret keys in turn to find the
right decryption key. This option forces the behaviour as
used by anonymous recipients (created by using
--throw-keyids) and might come handy in case where an
encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.</p>

<p>Input and Output</p>

<p>--armor</p>

<p>-a Create ASCII armored output. The default is to create
the binary OpenPGP format.</p>

<p>--no-armor Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored
format.</p>

<p>--output file</p>

<p>-o file Write output to file.</p>

<p>--max-output n This option sets a limit on the number of
bytes that will be generated when processing a file. Since
OpenPGP supports various levels of compression, it is
possible that the plaintext of a given message may be
significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message.
While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is
often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be
generated before processing is forced to stop by the OS
limits. Defaults to 0, which means &quot;no limit&quot;.</p>

<p>--import-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for importing keys.
Options can be prepended with a no- to give the opposite
meaning. The options are:</p>

<p>import-local-sigs Allow importing key signatures marked
as &quot;local&quot;. This is not generally useful unless a
shared keyring scheme is being used. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>repair-pks-subkey-bug During import, attempt to repair
the damage caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre version
0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note that
this cannot completely repair the damaged key as some
crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at
least give you back one subkey. Defaults to no for regular
--import and to yes for keyserver --recv-keys.</p>

<p>merge-only During import, allow key updates to existing
keys, but do not allow any new keys to be imported. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p>import-clean After import, compact (remove all
signatures except the self-signature) any user IDs from the
new key that are not usable. Then, remove any signatures
from the new key that are not usable. This includes
signatures that were issued by keys that are not present on
the keyring. This option is the same as running the
--edit-key command &quot;clean&quot; after import. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p>import-minimal Import the smallest key possible. This
removes all signa- tures except the most recent
self-signature on each user ID. This option is the same as
running the --edit-key command &quot;minimize&quot; after
import. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>--export-options parameters This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for exporting keys.
Options can be prepended with a no- to give the opposite
meaning. The options are:</p>

<p>export-local-sigs Allow exporting key signatures marked
as &quot;local&quot;. This is not generally useful unless a
shared keyring scheme is being used. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-attributes Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs)
while exporting. This is useful to export keys if they are
going to be used by an OpenPGP program that does not accept
attribute user IDs. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p>export-sensitive-revkeys Include designated revoker
information that was marked as &quot;sensitive&quot;.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-reset-subkey-passwd When using the
--export-secret-subkeys command, this option resets the
passphrases for all exported subkeys to empty. This is
useful when the exported subkey is to be used on an
unattended machine where a passphrase doesnt necessarily
make sense. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-clean Compact (remove all signatures from) user
IDs on the key being exported if the user IDs are not
usable. Also, do not export any signatures that are not
usable. This includes signatures that were issued by keys
that are not present on the keyring. This option is the same
as run- ning the --edit-key command &quot;clean&quot; before
export except that the local copy of the key is not
modified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>export-minimal Export the smallest key possible. This
removes all signa- tures except the most recent
self-signature on each user ID. This option is the same as
running the --edit-key command &quot;minimize&quot; before
export except that the local copy of the key is not
modified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>--with-colons Print key listings delimited by colons.
Note that the output will be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of
any --display-charset setting. This format is useful when
GnuPG is called from scripts and other programs as it is
easily machine parsed. The details of this format are
documented in the file doc/DETAILS, which is included in the
GnuPG source distribution.</p>

<p>--fixed-list-mode Do not merge primary user ID and
primary key in --with-colon listing mode and print all
timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01. Since GnuPG 2.0.10,
this mode is always used and thus this option is obsolete;
it does not harm to use it though.</p>

<p>--with-fingerprint Same as the command --fingerprint but
changes only the format of the output and may be used
together with another command.</p>

<p>OpenPGP protocol specific options.</p>

<p>-t, --textmode</p>

<p>--no-textmode Treat input files as text and store them
in the OpenPGP canoni- cal text form with standard
&quot;CRLF&quot; line endings. This also sets the necessary
flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or signed
data is text and may need its line endings converted back to
whatever the local system uses. This option is useful when
communicating between two platforms that have different line
ending conventions (UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc).
--no-textmode disables this option, and is the default.</p>

<p>--force-v3-sigs</p>

<p>--no-force-v3-sigs OpenPGP states that an implementation
should generate v4 signa- tures but PGP versions 5 through 7
only recognize v4 signatures on key material. This option
forces v3 signatures for signatures on data. Note that this
option implies --ask-sig-expire, --sig- policy-url,
--sig-notation, and --sig-keyserver-url, as these features
cannot be used with v3 signatures. --no-force-v3-sigs
disables this option.</p>

<p>--force-v4-certs</p>

<p>--no-force-v4-certs Always use v4 key signatures even on
v3 keys. This option also changes the default hash algorithm
for v3 RSA keys from MD5 to SHA-1. --no-force-v4-certs
disables this option.</p>

<p>--force-mdc Force the use of encryption with a
modification detection code. This is always used with the
newer ciphers (those with a block- size greater than 64
bits), or if all of the recipient keys indicate MDC support
in their feature flags.</p>

<p>--disable-mdc Disable the use of the modification
detection code. Note that by using this option, the
encrypted message becomes vulnerable to a message
modification attack.</p>

<p>--personal-cipher-preferences string Set the list of
personal cipher preferences to string. Use gpg2 --version to
get a list of available algorithms, and use none to set no
preference at all. This allows the user to safely over- ride
the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as
GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all
recipi- ents. The most highly ranked cipher in this list is
also used for the --symmetric encryption command.</p>

<p>--personal-digest-preferences string Set the list of
personal digest preferences to string. Use gpg2 --version to
get a list of available algorithms, and use none to set no
preference at all. This allows the user to safely over- ride
the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as
GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all
recipients. The most highly ranked digest algorithm in this
list is also used when signing without encryption (e.g.
--clear- sign or --sign). The default value is SHA-1.</p>

<p>--personal-compress-preferences string Set the list of
personal compression preferences to string. Use gpg2
--version to get a list of available algorithms, and use
none to set no preference at all. This allows the user to
safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key
pref- erences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is
usable by all recipients. The most highly ranked compression
algorithm in this list is also used when there are no
recipient keys to con- sider (e.g. --symmetric).</p>

<p>--s2k-cipher-algo name Use name as the cipher algorithm
used to protect secret keys. The default cipher is CAST5.
This cipher is also used for con- ventional encryption if
--personal-cipher-preferences and --cipher-algo is not
given.</p>

<p>--s2k-digest-algo name Use name as the digest algorithm
used to mangle the passphrases. The default algorithm is
SHA-1.</p>

<p>--s2k-mode n Selects how passphrases are mangled. If n
is 0 a plain passphrase (which is not recommended) will be
used, a 1 adds a salt to the passphrase and a 3 (the
default) iterates the whole process a number of times (see
--s2k-count). Unless --rfc1991 is used, this mode is also
used for conventional encryption.</p>

<p>--s2k-count n Specify how many times the passphrase
mangling is repeated. This value may range between 1024 and
65011712 inclusive, and the default is 65536. Note that not
all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an
illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the
nearest legal value. This option is only meaningful if
--s2k-mode is 3.</p>

<p>Compliance options</p>

<p>These options control what GnuPG is compliant to. Only
one of these options may be active at a time. Note that the
default setting of this is nearly always the correct one.
See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section
below before using one of these options.</p>

<p>--gnupg Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially
OpenPGP behav- ior (see --openpgp), but with some additional
workarounds for common compatibility problems in different
versions of PGP. This is the default option, so it is not
generally needed, but it may be useful to override a
different compliance option in the gpg.conf file.</p>

<p>--openpgp Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to
strict OpenPGP behavior. Use this option to reset all
previous options like --s2k-*, --cipher-algo, --digest-algo
and --compress-algo to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP
workarounds are disabled.</p>

<p>--rfc4880 Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to
strict RFC-4880 behavior. Note that this is currently the
same thing as --openpgp.</p>

<p>--rfc2440 Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to
strict RFC-2440 behavior.</p>

<p>--rfc1991 Try to be more RFC-1991 (PGP 2.x)
compliant.</p>

<p>--pgp2 Set up all options to be as PGP 2.x compliant as
possible, and warn if an action is taken (e.g. encrypting to
a non-RSA key) that will create a message that PGP 2.x will
not be able to han- dle. Note that PGP 2.x here means MIT
PGP 2.6.2. There are other versions of PGP 2.x available,
but the MIT release is a good common baseline.</p>

<p>This option implies --rfc1991 --disable-mdc
--no-force-v4-certs --escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs
--cipher-algo IDEA --digest- algo MD5 --compress-algo ZIP.
It also disables --textmode when encrypting.</p>

<p>--pgp6 Set up all options to be as PGP 6 compliant as
possible. This restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the
IDEA plugin is installed), 3DES, and CAST5, the hashes MD5,
SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the compression algorithms none and
ZIP. This also disables --throw-keyids, and making
signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6 does not understand
signatures made by signing subkeys.</p>

<p>This option implies --disable-mdc --escape-from-lines
--force- v3-sigs.</p>

<p>--pgp7 Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as
possible. This is identical to --pgp6 except that MDCs are
not disabled, and the list of allowable ciphers is expanded
to add AES128, AES192, AES256, and TWOFISH.</p>

<p>--pgp8 Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as
possible. PGP 8 is a lot closer to the OpenPGP standard than
previous versions of PGP, so all this does is disable
--throw-keyids and set --escape-from-lines. All algorithms
are allowed except for the SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512
digests.</p>

<p>Doing things one usually doest want to do.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>--dry-run Dont make any changes (this is not completely
implemented).</p>

<p>--list-only Changes the behaviour of some commands. This
is like --dry-run but different in some cases. The semantic
of this command may be extended in the future. Currently it
only skips the actual decryption pass and therefore enables
a fast listing of the encryption keys.</p>

<p>-i</p>

<p>--interactive Prompt before overwriting any files.</p>

<p>--debug-level level Select the debug level for
investigating problems. level may be a numeric value or by a
keyword:</p>

<p>none No debugging at all. A value of less than 1 may be
used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>basic Some basic debug messages. A value between 1 and 2
may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>advanced More verbose debug messages. A value between 3
and 5 may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>expert Even more detailed messages. A value between 6
and 8 may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p>guru All of the debug messages you can get. A value
greater than 8 may be used instead of the keyword. The
creation of hash tracing files is only enabled if the
keyword is used.</p>

<p>How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging
flags is not specified and may change with newer releases of
this program. They are however carefully selected to best
aid in debugging.</p>

<p>--debug flags Set debugging flags. All flags are or-ed
and flags may be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042).</p>

<p>--debug-all Set all useful debugging flags.</p>

<p>--enable-progress-filter Enable certain PROGRESS status
outputs. This option allows fron- tends to display a
progress indicator while gpg is processing larger files.
There is a slight performance overhead using it.</p>

<p>--status-fd n Write special status strings to the file
descriptor n. See the file DETAILS in the documentation for
a listing of them.</p>

<p>--status-file file Same as --status-fd, except the
status data is written to file file.</p>

<p>--logger-fd n Write log output to file descriptor n and
not to STDERR.</p>

<p>--log-file file</p>

<p>--logger-file file Same as --logger-fd, except the
logger data is written to file file. Note that --log-file is
only implemented for GnuPG-2.</p>

<p>--attribute-fd n Write attribute subpackets to the file
descriptor n. This is most useful for use with --status-fd,
since the status messages are needed to separate out the
various subpackets from the stream delivered to the file
descriptor.</p>

<p>--attribute-file file Same as --attribute-fd, except the
attribute data is written to file file.</p>

<p>--comment string</p>

<p>--no-comments Use string as a comment string in clear
text signatures and ASCII armored messages or keys (see
--armor). The default behav- ior is not to use a comment
string. --comment may be repeated multiple times to get
multiple comment strings. --no-comments removes all
comments. It is a good idea to keep the length of a single
comment below 60 characters to avoid problems with mail
programs wrapping such lines. Note that comment lines, like
all other header lines, are not protected by the
signature.</p>

<p>--emit-version</p>

<p>--no-emit-version Force inclusion of the version string
in ASCII armored output. --no-emit-version disables this
option.</p>

<p>--sig-notation name=value</p>

<p>--cert-notation name=value</p>

<p>-N, --set-notation name=value Put the name value pair
into the signature as notation data. name must consist only
of printable characters or spaces, and must contain a @
character in the form keyname@domain.exam- ple.com
(substituting the appropriate keyname and domain name, of
course). This is to help prevent pollution of the IETF
reserved notation namespace. The --expert flag overrides the
@ check. value may be any printable string; it will be
encoded in UTF8, so you should check that your
--display-charset is set correctly. If you prefix name with
an exclamation mark (!), the notation data will be flagged
as critical (rfc2440:5.2.3.15). --sig-notation sets a
notation for data signatures. --cert-nota- tion sets a
notation for key signatures (certifications). --set-
notation sets both.</p>

<p>There are special codes that may be used in notation
names. &quot;%k&quot; will be expanded into the key ID of
the key being signed, &quot;%K&quot; into the long key ID of
the key being signed, &quot;%f&quot; into the fin- gerprint
of the key being signed, &quot;%s&quot; into the key ID of
the key making the signature, &quot;%S&quot; into the long
key ID of the key making the signature, &quot;%g&quot; into
the fingerprint of the key mak- ing the signature (which
might be a subkey), &quot;%p&quot; into the fin- gerprint of
the primary key of the key making the signature,
&quot;%c&quot; into the signature count from the OpenPGP
smartcard, and &quot;%%&quot; results in a single
&quot;%&quot;. %k, %K, and %f are only meaningful when
making a key signature (certification), and %c is only
meaningful when using the OpenPGP smartcard.</p>

<p>--sig-policy-url string</p>

<p>--cert-policy-url string</p>

<p>--set-policy-url string Use string as a Policy URL for
signatures (rfc2440:5.2.3.19). If you prefix it with an
exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet will be flagged
as critical. --sig-policy-url sets a pol- icy url for data
signatures. --cert-policy-url sets a policy url for key
signatures (certifications). --set-policy-url sets both.</p>

<p>The same %-expandos used for notation data are available
here as well.</p>

<p>--sig-keyserver-url string Use string as a preferred
keyserver URL for data signatures. If you prefix it with an
exclamation mark (!), the keyserver URL packet will be
flagged as critical.</p>

<p>The same %-expandos used for notation data are available
here as well.</p>

<p>--set-filename string Use string as the filename which
is stored inside messages. This overrides the default, which
is to use the actual filename of the file being
encrypted.</p>

<p>--for-your-eyes-only</p>

<p>--no-for-your-eyes-only Set the for your eyes only flag
in the message. This causes GnuPG to refuse to save the file
unless the --output option is given, and PGP to use a
&quot;secure viewer&quot; with a claimed Tempest- resistant
font to display the message. This option overrides
--set-filename. --no-for-your-eyes-only disables this
option.</p>

<p>--use-embedded-filename</p>

<p>--no-use-embedded-filename Try to create a file with a
name as embedded in the data. This can be a dangerous option
as it allows to overwrite files. Defaults to no.</p>

<p>--cipher-algo name Use name as cipher algorithm. Running
the program with the com- mand --version yields a list of
supported algorithms. If this is not used the cipher
algorithm is selected from the preferences stored with the
key. In general, you do not want to use this option as it
allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard. --per-
sonal-cipher-preferences is the safe way to accomplish the
same thing.</p>

<p>--digest-algo name Use name as the message digest
algorithm. Running the program with the command --version
yields a list of supported algo- rithms. In general, you do
not want to use this option as it allows you to violate the
OpenPGP standard. --personal-digest- preferences is the safe
way to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>--compress-algo name Use compression algorithm name.
&quot;zlib&quot; is RFC-1950 ZLIB compres- sion.
&quot;zip&quot; is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by
PGP. &quot;bzip2&quot; is a more modern compression scheme
that can compress some things better than zip or zlib, but
at the cost of more memory used during compression and
decompression. &quot;uncompressed&quot; or &quot;none&quot;
disables compression. If this option is not used, the
default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences
to see which algorithms the recipient supports. If all else
fails, ZIP is used for maximum compatibility.</p>

<p>ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as
the com- pression window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2
may give even better compression results than that, but will
use a signifi- cantly larger amount of memory while
compressing and decompress- ing. This may be significant in
low memory situations. Note, however, that PGP (all
versions) only supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm
other than ZIP or &quot;none&quot; will make the mes- sage
unreadable with PGP. In general, you do not want to use this
option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
--personal-compress-preferences is the safe way to
accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>--cert-digest-algo name Use name as the message digest
algorithm used when signing a key. Running the program with
the command --version yields a list of supported algorithms.
Be aware that if you choose an algorithm that GnuPG supports
but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then some users
will not be able to use the key signa- tures you make, or
quite possibly your entire key.</p>

<p>--disable-cipher-algo name Never allow the use of name
as cipher algorithm. The given name will not be checked so
that a later loaded algorithm will still get disabled.</p>

<p>--disable-pubkey-algo name Never allow the use of name
as public key algorithm. The given name will not be checked
so that a later loaded algorithm will still get
disabled.</p>

<p>--throw-keyids</p>

<p>--no-throw-keyids Do not put the recipient key IDs into
encrypted messages. This helps to hide the receivers of the
message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic
analysis. ([Using a little social engineering anyone who is
able to decrypt the message can check whether one of the
other recipients is the one he suspects.]) On the receiving
side, it may slow down the decryption process because all
available secret keys must be tried. --no-throw- keyids
disables this option. This option is essentially the same as
using --hidden-recipient for all recipients.</p>

<p>--not-dash-escaped This option changes the behavior of
cleartext signatures so that they can be used for patch
files. You should not send such an armored file via email
because all spaces and line endings are hashed too. You can
not use this option for data which has 5 dashes at the
beginning of a line, patch files don t have this. A special
armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature
option.</p>

<p>--escape-from-lines</p>

<p>--no-escape-from-lines Because some mailers change lines
starting with &quot;From &quot; to &quot;&gt;From &quot; it
is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from
breaking the signature. Note that all other PGP versions do
it this way too. Enabled by default. --no-escape-from-lines
dis- ables this option.</p>

<p>--passphrase-repeat n Specify how many times gpg2 will
request a new passphrase be repeated. This is useful for
helping memorize a passphrase. Defaults to 1 repetition.</p>

<p>--passphrase-fd n Read the passphrase from file
descriptor n. Only the first line will be read from file
descriptor n. If you use 0 for n, the passphrase will be
read from STDIN. This can only be used if only one
passphrase is supplied. Note that this passphrase is only
used if the option --batch has also been given. This is
different from gpg.</p>

<p>--passphrase-file file Read the passphrase from file
file. Only the first line will be read from file file. This
can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied.
Obviously, a passphrase stored in a file is of questionable
security if other users can read this file. Dont use this
option if you can avoid it. Note that this passphrase is
only used if the option --batch has also been given. This is
different from gpg.</p>

<p>--passphrase string Use string as the passphrase. This
can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied.
Obviously, this is of very questionable security on a
multi-user system. Dont use this option if you can avoid it.
Note that this passphrase is only used if the option --batch
has also been given. This is different from gpg.</p>

<p>--command-fd n This is a replacement for the deprecated
shared-memory IPC mode. If this option is enabled, user
input on questions is not expected from the TTY but from the
given file descriptor. It should be used together with
--status-fd. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source
distribution for details on how to use it.</p>

<p>--command-file file Same as --command-fd, except the
commands are read out of file file</p>

<p>--allow-non-selfsigned-uid</p>

<p>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid Allow the import and use
of keys with user IDs which are not self-signed. This is not
recommended, as a non self-signed user ID is trivial to
forge. --no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid disables.</p>

<p>--allow-freeform-uid Disable all checks on the form of
the user ID while generating a new one. This option should
only be used in very special envi- ronments as it does not
ensure the de-facto standard format of user IDs.</p>

<p>--ignore-time-conflict GnuPG normally checks that the
timestamps associated with keys and signatures have
plausible values. However, sometimes a sig- nature seems to
be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
makes these checks just a warning. See also
--ignore-valid-from for timestamp issues on subkeys.</p>

<p>--ignore-valid-from GnuPG normally does not select and
use subkeys created in the future. This option allows the
use of such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour.
You should not use this option unless you there is some
clock problem. See also --ignore-time- conflict for
timestamp issues with signatures.</p>

<p>--ignore-crc-error The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is
protected by a CRC checksum against transmission errors.
Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on the
transmission channel but the actual content (which is
protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay.
This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.</p>

<p>--ignore-mdc-error This option changes a MDC integrity
protection failure into a warning. This can be useful if a
message is partially corrupt, but it is necessary to get as
much data as possible out of the corrupt message. However,
be aware that a MDC protection fail- ure may also mean that
the message was tampered with intention- ally by an
attacker.</p>

<p>--no-default-keyring Do not add the default keyrings to
the list of keyrings. Note that GnuPG will not operate
without any keyrings, so if you use this option and do not
provide alternate keyrings via --keyring or
--secret-keyring, then GnuPG will still use the default pub-
lic or secret keyrings.</p>

<p>--skip-verify Skip the signature verification step. This
may be used to make the decryption faster if the signature
verification is not needed.</p>

<p>--with-key-data Print key listings delimited by colons
(like --with-colons) and print the public key data.</p>

<p>--fast-list-mode Changes the output of the list commands
to work faster; this is achieved by leaving some parts
empty. Some applications dont need the user ID and the trust
information given in the list- ings. By using this options
they can get a faster listing. The exact behaviour of this
option may change in future versions. If you are missing
some information, dont use this option.</p>

<p>--no-literal This is not for normal use. Use the source
to see for what it might be useful.</p>

<p>--set-filesize This is not for normal use. Use the
source to see for what it might be useful.</p>

<p>--show-session-key Display the session key used for one
message. See --override- session-key for the counterpart of
this option.</p>

<p>We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the
user should have the freedom to decide whether to go to
prison or to reveal the content of one specific message
without compromising all messages ever encrypted for one
secret key. DONT USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY FORCED TO DO
SO.</p>

<p>--override-session-key string Dont use the public key
but the session key string. The format of this string is the
same as the one printed by --show-session- key. This option
is normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces
you to reveal the content of an encrypted mes- sage; using
this option you can do this without handing out the secret
key.</p>

<p>--ask-sig-expire</p>

<p>--no-ask-sig-expire When making a data signature, prompt
for an expiration time. If this option is not specified, the
expiration time set via --default-sig-expire is used.
--no-ask-sig-expire disables this option. Note that by
default, --force-v3-sigs is set which also disables this
option. If you want signature expiration, you must set
--no-force-v3-sigs as well as turning --ask-sig-expire
on.</p>

<p>--default-sig-expire The default expiration time to use
for signature expiration. Valid values are &quot;0&quot; for
no expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for days),
w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for example
&quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five
years), or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults
to &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p>--ask-cert-expire</p>

<p>--no-ask-cert-expire When making a key signature, prompt
for an expiration time. If this option is not specified, the
expiration time set via --default-cert-expire is used.
--no-ask-cert-expire disables this option.</p>

<p>--default-cert-expire The default expiration time to use
for key signature expiration. Valid values are &quot;0&quot;
for no expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for
days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for
example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for
five years), or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD.
Defaults to &quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p>--allow-secret-key-import This is an obsolete option and
is not used anywhere.</p>

<p>--allow-multiple-messages</p>

<p>--no-allow-multiple-messages Allow processing of
multiple OpenPGP messages contained in a single file or
stream. Some programs that call GPG are not pre- pared to
deal with multiple messages being processed together, so
this option defaults to no. Note that versions of GPG prior
to 1.4.7 always allowed multiple messages.</p>

<p>Warning: Do not use this option unless you need it as a
tempo- rary workaround!</p>

<p>--enable-special-filenames This options enables a mode
in which filenames of the form -&amp;n , where n is a
non-negative decimal number, refer to the file descriptor n
and not to a file with that name.</p>

<p>--no-expensive-trust-checks Experimental use only.</p>

<p>--preserve-permissions Don t change the permissions of a
secret keyring back to user read/write only. Use this option
only if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p>--default-preference-list string Set the list of default
preferences to string. This preference list is used for new
keys and becomes the default for &quot;setpref&quot; in the
edit menu.</p>

<p>--default-keyserver-url name Set the default keyserver
URL to name. This keyserver will be used as the keyserver
URL when writing a new self-signature on a key, which
includes key generation and changing preferences.</p>

<p>--list-config Display various internal configuration
parameters of GnuPG. This option is intended for external
programs that call GnuPG to per- form tasks, and is thus not
generally useful. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source
distribution for the details of which configuration items
may be listed. --list-config is only usable with
--with-colons set.</p>

<p>--gpgconf-list This command is similar to --list-config
but in general only internally used by the gpgconf tool.</p>

<p>--gpgconf-test This is more or less dummy action.
However it parses the con- figuration file and returns with
failure if the configuration file would prevent gpg from
startup. Thus it may be used to run a syntax check on the
configuration file.</p>

<p>Deprecated options</p>

<p>--show-photos</p>

<p>--no-show-photos Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs,
--list-public-keys, --list- secret-keys, and verifying a
signature to also display the photo ID attached to the key,
if any. See also --photo-viewer. These options are
deprecated. Use --list-options [no-]show-photos and/or
--verify-options [no-]show-photos instead.</p>

<p>--show-keyring Display the keyring name at the head of
key listings to show which keyring a given key resides on.
This option is deprecated: use --list-options
[no-]show-keyring instead.</p>

<p>--always-trust Identical to --trust-model always. This
option is deprecated.</p>

<p>--show-notation</p>

<p>--no-show-notation Show signature notations in the
--list-sigs or --check-sigs listings as well as when
verifying a signature with a notation in it. These options
are deprecated. Use --list-options [no-]show-notation and/or
--verify-options [no-]show-notation instead.</p>

<p>--show-policy-url</p>

<p>--no-show-policy-url Show policy URLs in the --list-sigs
or --check-sigs listings as well as when verifying a
signature with a policy URL in it. These options are
deprecated. Use --list-options [no-]show-pol- icy-url and/or
--verify-options [no-]show-policy-url instead.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES gpg -se -r Bob file sign and encrypt for user
Bob</p>

<p>gpg --clearsign file make a clear text signature</p>

<p>gpg -sb file make a detached signature</p>

<p>gpg -u 0x12345678 -sb file make a detached signature
with the key 0x12345678</p>

<p>gpg --list-keys user_ID show keys</p>

<p>gpg --fingerprint user_ID show fingerprint</p>

<p>gpg --verify pgpfile</p>

<p>gpg --verify sigfile Verify the signature of the file
but do not output the data. The second form is used for
detached signatures, where sigfile is the detached signature
(either ASCII armored or binary) and are the signed data; if
this is not given, the name of the file holding the signed
data is constructed by cutting off the exten- sion
(&quot;.asc&quot; or &quot;.sig&quot;) of sigfile or by
asking the user for the filename.</p>

<p>HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID There are different ways to
specify a user ID to GnuPG. Some of them are only valid for
gpg others are only good for gpgsm. Here is the entire list
of ways to specify a key:</p>

<p>By key Id. This format is deduced from the length of the
string and its content or 0x prefix. The key Id of an X.509
certificate are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint.
The use of key Ids is just a shortcut, for all automated
processing the fingerprint should be used.</p>

<p>When using gpg an exclamation mark (!) may be appended
to force using the specified primary or secondary key and
not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to
use.</p>

<p>The last four lines of the example give the key ID in
their long form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol.
You can see the long key ID using the option
--with-colons.</p>

<p>234567C4 0F34E556E 01347A56A 0xAB123456</p>

<p>234AABBCC34567C4 0F323456784E56EAB 01AB3FED1347A5612
0x234AABBCC34567C4</p>

<p>By fingerprint. This format is deduced from the length
of the string and its content or the 0x prefix. Note, that
only the 20 byte version fingerprint is available with gpgsm
(i.e. the SHA-1 hash of the certificate).</p>

<p>When using gpg an exclamation mark (!) may be appended
to force using the specified primary or secondary key and
not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to
use.</p>

<p>The best way to specify a key Id is by using the
fingerprint. This avoids any ambiguities in case that there
are duplicated key IDs.</p>

<p>1234343434343434C434343434343434
123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434
0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434
0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434</p>

<p>(gpgsm also accepts colons between each pair of
hexadecimal digits because this is the de-facto standard on
how to present X.509 finger- prints.)</p>

<p>By exact match on OpenPGP user ID. This is denoted by a
leading equal sign. It does not make sense for X.509
certificates.</p>

<p>=Heinrich Heine &lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt;</p>

<p>By exact match on an email address. This is indicated by
enclosing the email address in the usual way with left and
right angles.</p>

<p>&lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt;</p>

<p>By word match. All words must match exactly (not case
sensitive) but can appear in any order in the user ID or a
subjects name. Words are any sequences of letters, digits,
the underscore and all characters with bit 7 set.</p>

<p>+Heinrich Heine duesseldorf</p>

<p>By exact match on the subjecs DN. This is indicated by a
leading slash, directly followed by the RFC-2253 encoded DN
of the subject. Note that you cant use the string printed by
&quot;gpgsm --list-keys&quot; because that one as been
reordered and modified for better readability; use
--with-colons to print the raw (but standard escaped)
RFC-2253 string</p>

<p>/CN=Heinrich Heine,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR</p>

<p>By exact match on the issues DN. This is indicated by a
leading hash mark, directly followed by a slash and then
directly followed by the rfc2253 encoded DN of the issuer.
This should return the Root cert of the issuer. See note
above.</p>

<p>#/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR</p>

<p>By exact match on serial number and issues DN. This is
indicated by a hash mark, followed by the hexadecimal
representation of the serial number, then followed by a
slash and the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the issuer. See note
above.</p>

<p>#4F03/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR</p>

<p>By keygrip This is indicated by an ampersand followed by
the 40 hex digits of a keygrip. gpgsm prints the keygrip
when using the command --dump-cert. It does not yet work for
OpenPGP keys.</p>

<p>&amp;D75F22C3F86E355877348498CDC92BD21010A480</p>

<p>By substring match. This is the default mode but
applications may want to explicitly indicate this by putting
the asterisk in front. Match is not case sensitive.</p>

<p>Heine *Heine</p>

<p>Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier
which was used in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so
called local-id. It is not anymore used and there should be
no conflict when used with X.509 stuff.</p>

<p>Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that
it is not possi- ble to map them back to the original
encoding, however we dont have to do this because our key
database stores this encoding as meta data.</p>

<p>FILES There are a few configuration files to control
certain aspects of gpg2 s operation. Unless noted, they are
expected in the current home directory (see: [option
--homedir]).</p>

<p>gpg.conf This is the standard configuration file read by
gpg2 on startup. It may contain any valid long option; the
leading two dashes may not be entered and the option may not
be abbreviated. This default name may be changed on the
command line (see: [option --options]). You should backup
this file.</p>

<p>Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put
predefined files into the directory /etc/skel/.gnupg/ so
that newly created users start up with a working
configuration. For existing users the a small helper script
is provided to create these files (see: [addgnupghome]).</p>

<p>For internal purposes gpg2 creates and maintains a few
other files; They all live in in the current home directory
(see: [option --home- dir]). Only the gpg2 may modify these
files.</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/secring.gpg The secret keyring. You should
backup this file.</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock The lock file for the secret
keyring.</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg The public keyring. You should
backup this file.</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock The lock file for the public
keyring.</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg The trust database. There is no
need to backup this file; it is better to backup the
ownertrust values (see: [option --export- ownertrust]).</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock The lock file for the trust
database.</p>

<p>~/.gnupg/random_seed A file used to preserve the state
of the internal random pool.</p>

<p>/usr[/local]/share/gnupg/options.skel The skeleton
options file.</p>

<p>/usr[/local]/lib/gnupg/ Default location for
extensions.</p>

<p>Operation is further controlled by a few environment
variables:</p>

<p>HOME Used to locate the default home directory.</p>

<p>GNUPGHOME If set directory used instead of
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.</p>

<p>GPG_AGENT_INFO Used to locate the gpg-agent. The value
consists of 3 colon delimited fields: The first is the path
to the Unix Domain Socket, the second the PID of the
gpg-agent and the protocol version which should be set to 1.
When starting the gpg-agent as described in its
documentation, this variable is set to the cor- rect value.
The option --gpg-agent-info can be used to override it.</p>

<p>PINENTRY_USER_DATA This value is passed via gpg-agent to
pinentry. It is useful to convey extra information to a
custom pinentry.</p>

<p>COLUMNS</p>

<p>LINES Used to size some displays to the full size of the
screen.</p>

<p>LANGUAGE Apart from its use by GNU, it is used in the
W32 version to override the language selection done through
the Registry. If used and set to a valid and available
language name (langid), the file with the translation is
loaded from gpgdir/gnupg.nls/langid.mo. Here gpgdir is the
directory out of which the gpg binary has been loaded. If it
cant be loaded the Registry is tried and as last resort the
native Windows locale system is used.</p>

<p>BUGS On many systems this program should be installed as
setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages.
Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from
writing memory pages (which may contain passphrases or other
sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warning message
about insecure memory your operating system supports locking
without being root. The program drops root privileges as
soon as locked memory is allocated.</p>

<p>Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have
the ability to suspend to disk (also known as safe sleep or
hibernate ). This writes all memory to disk before going
into a low power or even powered off mode. Unless measures
are taken in the operating system to protect the saved
memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be
recoverable from it later.</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a
Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual including
a menu struc- ture and an index.</p>
