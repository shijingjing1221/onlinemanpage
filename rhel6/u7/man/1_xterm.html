<p>NAME xterm - terminal emulator for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xterm [-toolkitoption ...] [-option ...]
[shell]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xterm program is a terminal emulator for
the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 (VTxxx) and
Tektronix 4014 compatible termi- nals for programs that
cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying
operating system supports terminal resizing capabilities
(for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from
4.3bsd), xterm will use the facilities to notify programs
running in the window whenever it is resized.</p>

<p>The VTxxx and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their
own window so that you can edit text in one and look at
graphics in the other at the same time. To maintain the
correct aspect ratio (height/width), Tek- tronix graphics
will be restricted to the largest box with a 4014s aspect
ratio that will fit in the window. This box is located in
the upper left area of the window.</p>

<p>Although both windows may be displayed at the same time,
one of them is considered the active window for receiving
keyboard input and termi- nal output. This is the window
that contains the text cursor. The active window can be
chosen through escape sequences, the VT Options menu in the
VTxxx window, and the Tek Options menu in the 4014 win-
dow.</p>

<p>EMULATIONS The VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but
does not support autore- peat. Double-size characters are
displayed properly if your font server supports scalable
fonts. The VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it
is otherwise complete. Termcap(5) entries that work with
xterm include an optional platform-specific entry, xterm,
vt102, vt100, ansi and dumb. xterm automatically searches
the termcap file in this order for these entries and then
sets the TERM and the TERMCAP environment variables. You may
also use vt220, but must set the terminal emulation level
with the decTerminalID resource. (The TERMCAP environment
variable is not set if xterm is linked against a terminfo
library, since the requisite information is not provided by
the termcap emulation of terminfo libraries).</p>

<p>Many of the special xterm features may be modified under
program con- trol through a set of escape sequences
different from the standard VT102 escape sequences. (See the
Xterm Control Sequences document.)</p>

<p>The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good. It
supports 12-bit graphics addressing, scaled to the window
size. Four different font sizes and five different lines
types are supported. There is no write- through or defocused
mode support. The Tektronix text and graphics commands are
recorded internally by xterm and may be written to a file by
sending the COPY escape sequence (or through the Tektronix
menu; see below). The name of the file will be
COPYyyyy-MM-dd.hh:mm:ss, where yyyy, MM, dd, hh, mm and ss
are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second when the
COPY was performed (the file is created in the direc- tory
xterm is started in, or the home directory for a login
xterm).</p>

<p>Not all of the features described in this manual are
necessarily avail- able in this version of xterm. Some
(e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are available only if they
were compiled in, though the most commonly- used are in the
default configuration.</p>

<p>OTHER FEATURES Xterm automatically highlights the text
cursor when the pointer enters the window (selected) and
unhighlights it when the pointer leaves the window
(unselected). If the window is the focus window, then the
text cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer
is.</p>

<p>In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate
and deactivate an alternate screen buffer, which is the same
size as the display area of the window. When activated, the
current screen is saved and replaced with the alternate
screen. Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window
is disabled until the normal screen is restored. The
termcap(5) entry for xterm allows the visual editor vi(1) to
switch to the alter- nate screen for editing and to restore
the screen on exit. A popup menu entry makes it simple to
switch between the normal and alternate screens for cut and
paste.</p>

<p>In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape
sequences to change the name of the windows. Additionally,
in VT102 mode, xterm implements the window-manipulation
control sequences from dtterm, such as resizing the window,
setting its location on the screen.</p>

<p>Xterm allows character-based applications to receive
mouse events (cur- rently button-press and release events,
and button-motion events) as keyboard control sequences. See
Xterm Control Sequences for details.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The xterm terminal emulator accepts the standard
X Toolkit command line options as well as many
application-specific options. If the option begins with a +
instead of a -, the option is restored to its default value.
The -version and -help options are interpreted even if xterm
cannot open the display, and are useful for testing and
configu- ration scripts:</p>

<p>-version This causes xterm to print a version number to
the standard output.</p>

<p>-help This causes xterm to print out a verbose message
describing its options, one per line. The message is written
to the standard output. Xterm generates this message,
sorting it and noting whether a &quot;-option&quot; or a
&quot;+option&quot; turns the feature on or off, since some
features historically have been one or the other. Xterm
generates a concise help message (multiple options per line)
when an unknown option is used, e.g., xterm -z</p>

<p>If the logic for a particular option such as logging is
not compiled into xterm, the help text for that option also
is not displayed by the -help option.</p>

<p>One parameter (after all options) may be given. That
overrides xterms built-in choice of shell program. Normally
xterm checks the SHELL variable. If that is not set, xterm
tries to use the shell program specified in the password
file. If that is not set, xterm uses /bin/sh. If the
parameter names an executable file, xterm uses that instead.
The parameter must be an absolute path, or name a file found
on the user s PATH (and thereby construct an absolute path).
The -e option cannot be used with this parameter since it
uses all parameters following the option.</p>

<p>The other options are used to control the appearance and
behavior. Not all options are necessarily configured into
your copy of xterm:</p>

<p>-132 Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that
switches between 80 and 132 column mode is ignored. This
option causes the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized,
and the xterm window will resize appropriately.</p>

<p>-ah This option indicates that xterm should always
highlight the text cursor. By default, xterm will display a
hollow text cur- sor whenever the focus is lost or the
pointer leaves the win- dow.</p>

<p>+ah This option indicates that xterm should do text
cursor high- lighting based on focus.</p>

<p>-ai This option disables active icon support if that
feature was compiled into xterm. This is equivalent to
setting the vt100 resource activeIcon to false.</p>

<p>+ai This option enables active icon support if that
feature was compiled into xterm. This is equivalent to
setting the vt100 resource activeIcon to true.</p>

<p>-aw This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be
allowed. This allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the
beginning of the next line when it is at the rightmost
position of a line and text is output.</p>

<p>+aw This option indicates that auto-wraparound should
not be allowed.</p>

<p>-b number This option specifies the size of the inner
border (the dis- tance between the outer edge of the
characters and the window border) in pixels. That is the
vt100 internalBorder resource. The default is 2.</p>

<p>+bc turn off text cursor blinking. This overrides the
cursorBlink resource.</p>

<p>-bc turn on text cursor blinking. This overrides the
cursorBlink resource.</p>

<p>-bcf milliseconds set the amount of time text cursor is
off when blinking via the cursorOffTime resource.</p>

<p>-bcn milliseconds set the amount of time text cursor is
on when blinking via the cursorOffTime resource.</p>

<p>-bdc Set the vt100 resource colorBDMode to false,
disabling the display of characters with bold attribute as
color</p>

<p>+bdc Set the vt100 resource colorBDMode to true,
enabling the dis- play of characters with bold attribute as
color rather than bold</p>

<p>-cb Set the vt100 resource cutToBeginningOfLine to
false.</p>

<p>+cb Set the vt100 resource cutToBeginningOfLine to
true.</p>

<p>-cc characterclassrange:value[,...] This sets classes
indicated by the given ranges for using in selecting by
words. See the section specifying character classes. and
discussion of the charClass resource.</p>

<p>-cjk_width Set the cjkWidth resource to true . When
turned on, charac- ters with East Asian Ambiguous (A)
category in UTR 11 have a column width of 2. Otherwise, they
have a column width of 1. This may be useful for some legacy
CJK text terminal-based pro- grams assuming box drawings and
others to have a column width of 2. It also should be turned
on when you specify a TrueType CJK double-width
(bi-width/monospace) font either with -fa at the command
line or faceName resource. The default is false</p>

<p>+cjk_width Reset the cjkWidth resource.</p>

<p>-class string This option allows you to override xterm s
resource class. Normally it is XTerm, but can be set to
another class such as UXTerm to override selected
resources.</p>

<p>-cm This option disables recognition of ANSI
color-change escape sequences. It sets the colorMode
resource to false.</p>

<p>+cm This option enables recognition of ANSI color-change
escape sequences. This is the same as the vt100 resource
colorMode.</p>

<p>-cn This option indicates that newlines should not be
cut in line- mode selections. It sets the cutNewline
resource to false.</p>

<p>+cn This option indicates that newlines should be cut in
line-mode selections. It sets the cutNewline resource to
true.</p>

<p>-cr color This option specifies the color to use for
text cursor. The default is to use the same foreground color
that is used for text. It sets the cursorColor resource
according to the param- eter.</p>

<p>-cu This option indicates that xterm should work around
a bug in the more(1) program that causes it to incorrectly
display lines that are exactly the width of the window and
are followed by a line beginning with a tab (the leading
tabs are not displayed). This option is so named because it
was originally thought to be a bug in the curses(3x) cursor
motion package.</p>

<p>+cu This option indicates that xterm should not work
around the more(1) bug mentioned above.</p>

<p>-dc This option disables the escape sequence to change
dynamic col- ors: the vt100 foreground and background
colors, its text cur- sor color, the pointer cursor
foreground and background colors, the Tektronix emulator
foreground and background colors, its text cursor color and
highlight color. The option sets the dynamicColors option to
false.</p>

<p>+dc This option enables the escape sequence to change
dynamic col- ors. The option sets the dynamicColors option
to true.</p>

<p>-e program [ arguments ... ] This option specifies the
program (and its command line argu- ments) to be run in the
xterm window. It also sets the window title and icon name to
be the basename of the program being executed if neither -T
nor -n are given on the command line. This must be the last
option on the command line.</p>

<p>-en encoding This option determines the encoding on
which xterm runs. It sets the locale resource. Encodings
other than UTF-8 are sup- ported by using luit. The -lc
option should be used instead of -en for systems with locale
support.</p>

<p>-fb font This option specifies a font to be used when
displaying bold text. This font must be the same height and
width as the nor- mal font. If only one of the normal or
bold fonts is speci- fied, it will be used as the normal
font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this
font. The default is to do overstriking of the normal font.
See also the discussion of boldFont, boldMode and
alwaysBoldMode resources.</p>

<p>-fa pattern This option sets the pattern for fonts
selected from the FreeType library if support for that
library was compiled into xterm. This corresponds to the
faceName resource. When a CJK double-width font is
specified, you also need to turn on the cjkWidth resource.
See also the renderFont resource, which combines with this
to determine whether FreeType fonts are ini- tially
active.</p>

<p>-fbb This option indicates that xterm should compare
normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure they are
compatible. It sets the freeBoldBox resource to false.</p>

<p>+fbb This option indicates that xterm should not compare
normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure they are
compatible. It sets the freeBoldBox resource to true.</p>

<p>-fbx This option indicates that xterm should not assume
that the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing
characters. If any are missing, xterm will draw the
characters directly. It sets the forceBoxChars resource to
false.</p>

<p>+fbx This option indicates that xterm should assume that
the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing
characters. It sets the forceBoxChars resource to true.</p>

<p>-fd pattern This option sets the pattern for
double-width fonts selected from the FreeType library if
support for that library was com- piled into xterm. This
corresponds to the faceNameDoublesize resource.</p>

<p>-fi font This option sets the font for active icons if
that feature was compiled into xterm. See also the
discussion of the iconFont resource.</p>

<p>-fs size This option sets the pointsize for fonts
selected from the FreeType library if support for that
library was compiled into xterm. This corresponds to the
faceSize resource.</p>

<p>-fw font This option specifies the font to be used for
displaying wide text. By default, it will attempt to use a
font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw
normal text. If no dou- ble-width font is found, it will
improvise, by stretching the normal font. This corresponds
to the wideFont resource.</p>

<p>-fwb font This option specifies the font to be used for
displaying bold wide text. By default, it will attempt to
use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw bold text. If no double-width font is found, it will
improvise, by stretching the bold font. This corresponds to
the wideBoldFont resource.</p>

<p>-fx font This option specifies the font to be used for
displaying the preedit string in the &quot;OverTheSpot&quot;
input method. See also the discussion of the ximFont
resource.</p>

<p>-hc color (see -selbg).</p>

<p>-hf This option indicates that HP Function Key escape
codes should be generated for function keys. It sets the
hpFunctionKeys resource to true.</p>

<p>+hf This option indicates that HP Function Key escape
codes should not be generated for function keys. It sets the
hpFunctionKeys resource to false.</p>

<p>-hm Tells xterm to use highlightTextColor and
highlightColor to override the reversed
foreground/background colors in a selec- tion. It sets the
highlightColorMode resource to true.</p>

<p>+hm Tells xterm not to use highlightTextColor and
highlightColor to override the reversed
foreground/background colors in a selec- tion. It sets the
highlightColorMode resource to false.</p>

<p>-hold Turn on the hold resource, i.e., xterm will not
immediately destroy its window when the shell command
completes. It will wait until you use the window manager to
destroy/kill the win- dow, or if you use the menu entries
that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.</p>

<p>+hold Turn off the hold resource, i.e., xterm will
immediately destroy its window when the shell command
completes.</p>

<p>-ie Turn on the ptyInitialErase resource, i.e., use the
pseudo-ter- minals sense of the stty erase value.</p>

<p>+ie Turn off the ptyInitialErase resource, i.e., set the
stty erase value using the kb string from the termcap entry
as a refer- ence, if available.</p>

<p>-im Turn on the useInsertMode resource, which forces use
of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable.</p>

<p>+im Turn off the useInsertMode resource.</p>

<p>-into windowId Given an X window identifier (a decimal
integer), xterm will reparent its top-level shell widget to
that window. This is used to embed xterm within other
applications.</p>

<p>-j This option indicates that xterm should do jump
scrolling. It corresponds to the jumpScroll resource.
Normally, text is scrolled one line at a time; this option
allows xterm to move multiple lines at a time so that it
does not fall as far behind. Its use is strongly recommended
since it makes xterm much faster when scanning through large
amounts of text. The VT100 escape sequences for enabling and
disabling smooth scroll as well as the VT Options menu can
be used to turn this fea- ture on or off.</p>

<p>+j This option indicates that xterm should not do jump
scrolling.</p>

<p>-k8 This option sets the allowC1Printable resource. When
allowC1Printable is set, xterm overrides the mapping of C1
con- trol characters (code 128-159) to treat them as
printable.</p>

<p>+k8 This option resets the allowC1Printable
resource.</p>

<p>-kt keyboardtype This option sets the keyboardType
resource. Possible values include: unknown, default, hp,
sco, sun , tcap and vt220.</p>

<p>The value unknown , causes the corresponding resource to
be ignored.</p>

<p>The value default, suppresses the associated resources
hpFunctionKeys, scoFunctionKeys, sunFunctionKeys,
tcapFunction- Keys and sunKeyboard, using the Sun/PC
keyboard layout.</p>

<p>-l Turn logging on. Normally logging is not supported,
due to security concerns. Some versions of xterm may have
logging enabled. The logfile is written to the directory
from which xterm is invoked. The filename is generated, of
the form</p>

<p>XtermLog.XXXXXX</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Xterm.log.hostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX</p>

<p>depending on how xterm was built.</p>

<p>+l Turn logging off.</p>

<p>-lc Turn on support of various encodings according to
the users locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG
environment variables. This is achieved by turning on UTF-8
mode and by invoking luit for conversion between locale
encodings and UTF-8. (luit is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.)
This corre- sponds to the locale resource.</p>

<p>The actual list of encodings which are supported is
determined by luit. Consult the luit manual page for further
details. See also the discussion of the -u8 option which
supports UTF-8 locales.</p>

<p>+lc Turn off support of automatic selection of locale
encodings. Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales or
with -u8 option, UTF-8 mode will be used.</p>

<p>-lcc path File name for the encoding converter from/to
locale encodings and UTF-8 which is used with -lc option or
locale resource. This corresponds to the localeFilter
resource.</p>

<p>-leftbar Force scrollbar to the left side of VT100
screen. This is the default, unless you have set the
rightScrollBar resource.</p>

<p>-lf filename Specify the log-filename. See the -l
option.</p>

<p>-ls This option indicates that the shell that is started
in the xterm window will be a login shell (i.e., the first
character of argv[0] will be a dash, indicating to the shell
that it should read the users .login or .profile).</p>

<p>The -ls flag and the loginShell resource are ignored if
-e is also given, because xterm does not know how to make
the shell start the given command after whatever it does
when it is a login shell - the users shell of choice need
not be a Bourne shell after all. Also, xterm -e is supposed
to provide a con- sistent functionality for other
applications that need to start text-mode programs in a
window, and if loginShell were not ignored, the result of
~/.profile might interfere with that.</p>

<p>If you do want the effect of -ls and -e simultaneously,
you may get away with something like xterm -e /bin/bash -l
-c &quot;my command here&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, -ls is not completely ignored, because xterm
-ls -e does write a /var/log/wtmp entry (if configured to do
so), whereas xterm -e does not.</p>

<p>-maximized This option indicates that xterm should ask
the window manager to maximize its layout on startup. This
corresponds to the maximized resource.</p>

<p>Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying; it is
possible to do both with certain window managers.</p>

<p>+maximized This option indicates that xterm should ask
the window manager to maximize its layout on startup.</p>

<p>+ls This option indicates that the shell that is started
should not be a login shell (i.e., it will be a normal
subshell).</p>

<p>-mb This option indicates that xterm should ring a
margin bell when the user types near the right end of a
line. This option can be turned on and off from the VT
Options menu.</p>

<p>+mb This option indicates that margin bell should not be
rung.</p>

<p>-mc milliseconds This option specifies the maximum time
between multi-click selections.</p>

<p>-mesg Turn off the messages resource, i.e., disallow
write access to the terminal.</p>

<p>+mesg Turn on the messages resource, i.e., allow write
access to the terminal.</p>

<p>-mk_width Set the mkWidth resource to true. This makes
xterm use a built-in version of the wide-character width
calculation. The default is false</p>

<p>+mk_width Reset the mkWidth resource.</p>

<p>-ms color This option specifies the color to be used for
the pointer cur- sor. The default is to use the foreground
color. This sets the pointerColor resource.</p>

<p>-nb number This option specifies the number of
characters from the right end of a line at which the margin
bell, if enabled, will ring. The default is 10.</p>

<p>-nul This option disables the display of
underlining.</p>

<p>+nul This option enables the display of underlining.</p>

<p>-pc This option enables the PC-style use of bold colors
(see bold- Colors resource).</p>

<p>+pc This option disables the PC-style use of bold
colors.</p>

<p>-pob This option indicates that the window should be
raised whenever a Control-G is received.</p>

<p>+pob This option indicates that the window should not be
raised whenever a Control-G is received.</p>

<p>-rightbar Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100
screen.</p>

<p>-rvc This option disables the display of characters with
reverse attribute as color.</p>

<p>+rvc This option enables the display of characters with
reverse attribute as color.</p>

<p>-rw This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should
be allowed. This allows the cursor to back up from the
leftmost column of one line to the rightmost column of the
previous line. This is very useful for editing long shell
command lines and is encouraged. This option can be turned
on and off from the VT Options menu.</p>

<p>+rw This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should
not be allowed.</p>

<p>-s This option indicates that xterm may scroll
asynchronously, meaning that the screen does not have to be
kept completely up to date while scrolling. This allows
xterm to run faster when network latencies are very high and
is typically useful when running across a very large
internet or many gateways.</p>

<p>+s This option indicates that xterm should scroll
synchronously.</p>

<p>-samename Does not send title and icon name change
requests when the request would have no effect: the name is
not changed. This has the advantage of preventing flicker
and the disadvantage of requiring an extra round trip to the
server to find out the previous value. In practice this
should never be a problem.</p>

<p>+samename Always send title and icon name change
requests.</p>

<p>-sb This option indicates that some number of lines that
are scrolled off the top of the window should be saved and
that a scrollbar should be displayed so that those lines can
be viewed. This option may be turned on and off from the VT
Options menu.</p>

<p>+sb This option indicates that a scrollbar should not be
displayed.</p>

<p>-selbg color This option specifies the color to use for
the background of selected text. If not specified, reverse
video is used. See the discussion of the highlightColor
resource.</p>

<p>-selfg color This option specifies the color to use for
selected text. If not specified, reverse video is used. See
the discussion of the highlightTextColor resource.</p>

<p>-sf This option indicates that Sun Function Key escape
codes should be generated for function keys.</p>

<p>+sf This option indicates that the standard escape codes
should be generated for function keys.</p>

<p>-si This option indicates that output to a window should
not auto- matically reposition the screen to the bottom of
the scrolling region. This option can be turned on and off
from the VT Options menu.</p>

<p>+si This option indicates that output to a window should
cause it to scroll to the bottom.</p>

<p>-sk This option indicates that pressing a key while
using the scrollbar to review previous lines of text should
cause the window to be repositioned automatically in the
normal position at the bottom of the scroll region.</p>

<p>+sk This option indicates that pressing a key while
using the scrollbar should not cause the window to be
repositioned.</p>

<p>-sl number This option specifies the number of lines to
save that have been scrolled off the top of the screen. This
corresponds to the saveLines resource. The default is
64.</p>

<p>-sm This option, corresponding to the sessionMgt
resource, indi- cates that xterm should set up session
manager callbacks.</p>

<p>+sm This option indicates that xterm should not set up
session man- ager callbacks.</p>

<p>-sp This option indicates that Sun/PC keyboard should be
assumed, providing mapping for keypad + to ,, and CTRL-F1 to
F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.</p>

<p>+sp This option indicates that the standard escape codes
should be generated for keypad and function keys.</p>

<p>-t This option indicates that xterm should start in
Tektronix mode, rather than in VT102 mode. Switching between
the two windows is done using the Options menus. Termcap(5)
entries that work with xterm tek4014, tek4015, tek4012,
tek4013, tek4010, and dumb. xterm automatically searches the
termcap file in this order for these entries and then sets
the TERM and the TERMCAP environment variables.</p>

<p>+t This option indicates that xterm should start in
VT102 mode.</p>

<p>-tb This option, corresponding to the toolBar resource,
indicates that xterm should display a toolbar (or menubar)
at the top of its window. The buttons in the toolbar
correspond to the popup menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for
&quot;Main Options&quot;.</p>

<p>+tb This option indicates that xterm should not set up a
toolbar.</p>

<p>-ti term_id Specify the name used by xterm to select the
correct response to terminal ID queries. It also specifies
the emulation level, used to determine the type of response
to a DA control sequence. Valid values include vt52, vt100,
vt101, vt102, and vt220 (the &quot;vt&quot; is optional).
The default is vt100. The term_id argument specifies the
terminal ID to use. (This is the same as the decTerminalID
resource).</p>

<p>-tm string This option specifies a series of terminal
setting keywords followed by the characters that should be
bound to those func- tions, similar to the stty program. The
keywords and their values are described in detail in the
ttyModes resource.</p>

<p>-tn name This option specifies the name of the terminal
type to be set in the TERM environment variable. It
corresponds to the termName resource. This terminal type
must exist in the termi- nal database (termcap or terminfo,
depending on how xterm is built) and should have li# and co#
entries. If the terminal type is not found, xterm uses the
built-in list xterm, vt102, etc.</p>

<p>-u8 This option sets the utf8 resource. When utf8 is
set, xterm interprets incoming data as UTF-8. This sets the
wideChars resource as a side-effect, but the UTF-8 mode set
by this option prevents it from being turned off. If you
must turn it on and off, use the wideChars resource.</p>

<p>This option and the utf8 resource are overridden by the
-lc and -en options and locale resource. That is, if xterm
has been compiled to support luit, and the locale resource
is not false this option is ignored. We recommend using the
-lc option or the locale: true resource in UTF-8 locales
when your operating system supports locale, or -en UTF-8
option or the locale: UTF-8 resource when your operating
system does not support locale.</p>

<p>+u8 This option resets the utf8 resource.</p>

<p>-uc This option makes the cursor underlined instead of a
box.</p>

<p>+uc This option makes the cursor a box instead of
underlined.</p>

<p>-ulc This option disables the display of characters with
underline attribute as color rather than with
underlining.</p>

<p>+ulc This option enables the display of characters with
underline attribute as color rather than with
underlining.</p>

<p>-ulit This option, corresponding to the italicULMode
resource, dis- ables the display of characters with
underline attribute as italics rather than with
underlining.</p>

<p>+ulit This option, corresponding to the italicULMode
resource, enables the display of characters with underline
attribute as italics rather than with underlining.</p>

<p>-ut This option indicates that xterm should not write a
record into the the system utmp log file.</p>

<p>+ut This option indicates that xterm should write a
record into the system utmp log file.</p>

<p>-vb This option indicates that a visual bell is
preferred over an audible one. Instead of ringing the
terminal bell whenever a Control-G is received, the window
will be flashed.</p>

<p>+vb This option indicates that a visual bell should not
be used.</p>

<p>-wc This option sets the wideChars resource. When
wideChars is set, xterm maintains internal structures for
16-bit characters. If you do not set this resource to true,
xterm will ignore the escape sequence which turns UTF-8 mode
on and off. The default is false.</p>

<p>+wc This option resets the wideChars resource.</p>

<p>-wf This option indicates that xterm should wait for the
window to be mapped the first time before starting the
subprocess so that the initial terminal size settings and
environment variables are correct. It is the application s
responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size
changes.</p>

<p>+wf This option indicates that xterm should not wait
before start- ing the subprocess.</p>

<p>-ziconbeep percent Same as zIconBeep resource. If
percent is non-zero, xterms that produce output while
iconified will cause an XBell sound at the given volume and
have &quot;***&quot; prepended to their icon titles. Most
window managers will detect this change immedi- ately,
showing you which window has the output. (A similar feature
was in x10 xterm.)</p>

<p>-C This option indicates that this window should receive
console output. This is not supported on all systems. To
obtain con- sole output, you must be the owner of the
console device, and you must have read and write permission
for it. If you are running X under xdm on the console screen
you may need to have the session startup and reset programs
explicitly change the ownership of the console device in
order to get this option to work.</p>

<p>-Sccn This option allows xterm to be used as an input
and output channel for an existing program and is sometimes
used in spe- cialized applications. The option value
specifies the last few letters of the name of a
pseudo-terminal to use in slave mode, plus the number of the
inherited file descriptor. If the option contains a /
character, that delimits the characters used for the
pseudo-terminal name from the file descriptor. Otherwise,
exactly two characters are used from the option for the
pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.
Examples: -S123/45 -Sab34</p>

<p>Note that xterm does not close any file descriptor which
it did not open for its own use. It is possible (though
probably not portable) to have an application which passes
an open file descriptor down to xterm past the
initialization or the -S option to a process running in the
xterm.</p>

<p>The following command line arguments are provided for
compatibility with older versions. They may not be supported
in the next release as the X Toolkit provides standard
options that accomplish the same task.</p>

<p>%geom This option specifies the preferred size and
position of the Tektronix window. It is shorthand for
specifying the *tekGe- ometry resource.</p>

<p>#geom This option specifies the preferred position of
the icon win- dow. It is shorthand for specifying the
*iconGeometry resource.</p>

<p>-T string This option specifies the title for xterm s
windows. It is equivalent to -title.</p>

<p>-n string This option specifies the icon name for xterms
windows. It is shorthand for specifying the *iconName
resource. Note that this is not the same as the toolkit
option -name (see below). The default icon name is the
application name.</p>

<p>-r This option indicates that reverse video should be
simulated by swapping the foreground and background colors.
It is equiva- lent to -rv.</p>

<p>-w number This option specifies the width in pixels of
the border sur- rounding the window. It is equivalent to
-borderwidth or -bw.</p>

<p>The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments
are commonly used with xterm:</p>

<p>-bd color This option specifies the color to use for the
border of the window. xterm uses the X Toolkit default,
which is XtDefault- Foreground.</p>

<p>-bg color This option specifies the color to use for the
background of the window. The default is
XtDefaultBackground.</p>

<p>-bw number This option specifies the width in pixels of
the border sur- rounding the window.</p>

<p>This appears to be a legacy of older X releases. It sets
the borderWidth resource of the shell widget, and may
provide advice to your window manager to set the thickness
of the win- dow frame. Most window managers do not use this
information. See the -b option, which controls the inner
border of the xterm window.</p>

<p>-display display This option specifies the X server to
contact; see X(7).</p>

<p>-fg color This option specifies the color to use for
displaying text. The default is XtDefaultForeground.</p>

<p>-fn font This option specifies the font to be used for
displaying normal text. The default is fixed.</p>

<p>-font font This is the same as -fn.</p>

<p>-geometry geometry This option specifies the preferred
size and position of the VT102 window; see X(7).</p>

<p>-iconic This option indicates that xterm should ask the
window manager to start it as an icon rather than as the
normal window.</p>

<p>-name name This option specifies the application name
under which resources are to be obtained, rather than the
default exe- cutable file name. Name should not contain . or
* charac- ters.</p>

<p>-rv This option indicates that reverse video should be
simulated by swapping the foreground and background
colors.</p>

<p>+rv Disable the simulation of reverse video by swapping
foreground and background colors.</p>

<p>-title string This option specifies the window title
string, which may be displayed by window managers if the
user so chooses. The default title is the command line
specified after the -e option, if any, otherwise the
application name.</p>

<p>-xrm resourcestring This option specifies a resource
string to be used. This is especially useful for setting
resources that do not have sepa- rate command line
options.</p>

<p>RESOURCES The program understands all of the core X
Toolkit resource names and classes. Application specific
resources (e.g., &quot;XTerm.NAME&quot;) follow:</p>

<p>backarrowKeyIsErase (class BackarrowKeyIsErase) Tie the
VTxxx backarrowKey and ptyInitialErase resources together by
setting the DECBKM state according to whether the initial
value of stty erase is a backspace (8) or delete (127)
character. The default is false, which disables this fea-
ture.</p>

<p>hold (class Hold) If true, xterm will not immediately
destroy its window when the shell command completes. It will
wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the
window, or if you use the menu entries that send a signal,
e.g., HUP or KILL. You may scroll back, select text, etc.,
to perform most graphical operations. Resizing the display
will lose data, however, since this involves interaction
with the shell which is no longer running.</p>

<p>hpFunctionKeys (class HpFunctionKeys) Specifies whether
or not HP Function Key escape codes should be generated for
function keys instead of standard escape sequences. See also
the keyboardType resource.</p>

<p>iconGeometry (class IconGeometry) Specifies the
preferred size and position of the application when
iconified. It is not necessarily obeyed by all window
managers.</p>

<p>iconName (class IconName) Specifies the icon name. The
default is the application name.</p>

<p>keyboardType (class KeyboardType) Enables one (or none)
of the various keyboard-type resources: hpFunctionKeys,
scoFunctionKeys, sunFunctionKeys, tcapFunction- Keys and
sunKeyboard. The resource s value should be one of the
corresponding strings hp, sco, sun, tcap or vt220. The
individual resources are provided for legacy sup- port; this
resource is simpler to use.</p>

<p>maxBufSize (class MaxBufSize) Specify the maximum size
of the input buffer. The default is 32768. You cannot set
this to a value less than the minBufSize resource. It will
be increased as needed to make that value evenly divide this
one.</p>

<p>On some systems you may want to increase one or both of
the maxBufSize and minBufSize resource values to achieve
better performance if the operating system prefers larger
buffer sizes.</p>

<p>maximized (class Maximized) Specifies whether or not
xterm should ask the window manager to maximize its layout
on startup. The default is false.</p>

<p>messages (class Messages) Specifies whether write access
to the terminal is allowed ini- tially. See mesg(1). The
default is true.</p>

<p>menuLocale (class MenuLocale) Specify the locale used
for character-set computations when loading the popup menus.
Use this to improve initialization performance of the Athena
popup menus, which may load unneces- sary (and very large)
fonts, e.g., in a locale having UTF-8 encoding. The default
is an empty string, which uses the cur- rent locale
setting.</p>

<p>Set it to C to achieve the best performance using the
default menu resource settings. If you happen to be using
localized menu resources, set the resource accordingly.</p>

<p>minBufSize (class MinBufSize) Specify the minimum size
of the input buffer, i.e., the amount of data that xterm
requests on each read. The default is 4096. You cannot set
this to a value less than 64.</p>

<p>ptyHandshake (class PtyHandshake) If true, xterm will
perform handshaking during initialization to ensure that the
parent and child processes update the utmp and stty state.
See also waitForMap which waits for the pseudo-terminal s
notion of the screen size, and ptySttySize which resets the
screen size after other terminal initializa- tion is
complete. The default is true.</p>

<p>ptyInitialErase (class PtyInitialErase) If true , xterm
will use the pseudo-terminals sense of the stty erase value.
If false, xterm will set the stty erase value to match its
own configuration, using the kb string from the termcap
entry as a reference, if available. In either case, the
result is applied to the TERMCAP variable which xterm sets.
See also the ttyModes resource, which may modify this. The
default is false.</p>

<p>ptySttySize (class PtySttySize) If true , xterm will
reset the screen size after terminal ini- tialization is
complete. This is needed for some systems whose
pseudo-terminals cannot propagate terminal characteristics.
Where it is not needed, it can interfere with other methods
for setting the intial screen size, e.g., via window manager
inter- action. See also waitForMap which waits for a
handshake-mes- sage giving the pseudo-terminals notion of
the screen size. The default is false on Linux and OS X
systems, true other- wise.</p>

<p>sameName (class SameName) If the value of this resource
is true, xterm does not send title and icon name change
requests when the request would have no effect: the name is
not changed. This has the advantage of preventing flicker
and the disadvantage of requiring an extra round trip to the
server to find out the previous value. In practice this
should never be a problem. The default is true.</p>

<p>scoFunctionKeys (class ScoFunctionKeys) Specifies
whether or not SCP Function Key escape codes should be
generated for function keys instead of standard escape
sequences. See also the keyboardType resource.</p>

<p>sessionMgt (class SessionMgt) If the value of this
resource is true, xterm sets up session manager callbacks
for XtNdieCallback and XtNsaveCallback. The default is
true.</p>

<p>sunFunctionKeys (class SunFunctionKeys) Specifies
whether or not Sun Function Key escape codes should be
generated for function keys instead of standard escape
sequences. See also the keyboardType resource.</p>

<p>sunKeyboard (class SunKeyboard) Specifies whether or not
Sun/PC keyboard layout should be assumed rather than DEC
VT220. This causes the keypad + to be mapped to , . and CTRL
F1-F12 to F11-F20, depending on the setting of the ctrlFKeys
resource. so xterm emulates a DEC VT220 more accurately.
Otherwise (the default, with sunKey- board set to false ),
xterm uses PC-style bindings for the function keys and
keypad.</p>

<p>PC-style bindings use the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta
keys as modifiers for function-keys and keypad (see the
document Xterm Control Sequences for details). The PC-style
bindings are analogous to PCTerm, but not the same thing.
Normally these bindings do not conflict with the use of the
Meta key as described for the eightBitInput resource. If
they do, note that the PC-style bindings are evaluated
first. See also the keyboardType resource.</p>

<p>tcapFunctionKeys (class TcapFunctionKeys) Specifies
whether or not function key escape codes read from the
termcap/terminfo entry should be generated for function keys
instead of standard escape sequences. See also the key-
boardType resource.</p>

<p>termName (class TermName) Specifies the terminal type
name to be set in the TERM environ- ment variable.</p>

<p>title (class Title) Specifies a string that may be used
by the window manager when displaying this application.</p>

<p>toolBar (class ToolBar) Specifies whether or not the
toolbar should be displayed. The default is true.</p>

<p>ttyModes (class TtyModes) Specifies a string containing
terminal setting keywords and the characters to which they
may be bound. Allowable keywords include: brk, dsusp, eof,
eol, eol2, erase, erase2, flush, intr, kill, lnext, quit,
rprnt, start, status, stop, susp, swtch and weras. Control
characters may be specified as ^char (e.g., ^c or ^u) and ^?
may be used to indicate delete (127). Use ^- to denote
undef. Use 034 to represent ^ since a lit- eral backslash in
an X resource escapes the next character.</p>

<p>This is very useful for overriding the default terminal
set- tings without having to do an stty every time an xterm
is started. Note, however, that the stty program on a given
host may use different keywords; xterm s table is
built-in.</p>

<p>If the ttyModes resource specifies a value for erase,
that overrides the ptyInitialErase resource setting, i.e.,
xterm initializes the terminal to match that value.</p>

<p>useInsertMode (class UseInsertMode) Force use of insert
mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable. This is useful if the system termcap
is broken. The default is false.</p>

<p>utmpDisplayId (class UtmpDisplayId) Specifies whether or
not xterm should try to record the display identifier
(display number and screen number) as well as the hostname
in the system utmp log file. The default is true.</p>

<p>utmpInhibit (class UtmpInhibit) Specifies whether or not
xterm should try to record the users terminal in the system
utmp log file. If true, xterm will not try. The default is
false.</p>

<p>waitForMap (class WaitForMap) Specifies whether or not
xterm should wait for the initial win- dow map before
starting the subprocess. This is part of the ptyHandshake
logic. When xterm is directed to wait in this fashion, it
passes the terminal size from the display end of the
pseudo-terminal to the terminal I/O connection, e.g.,
according to the window manager. Otherwise, it uses the size
as given in resource values or command-line option -geom.
The default is false.</p>

<p>zIconBeep (class ZIconBeep) Same as -ziconbeep command
line argument. If the value of this resource is non-zero,
xterms that produce output while iconi- fied will cause an
XBell sound at the given volume and have &quot;***&quot;
prepended to their icon titles. Most window managers will
detect this change immediately, showing you which window has
the output. (A similar feature was in x10 xterm.) The
default is false.</p>

<p>VT100 Widget Resources The following resources are
specified as part of the vt100 widget (class VT100). They
are specified by patterns such as
&quot;XTerm.vt100.NAME&quot;.</p>

<p>If your xterm is configured to support the
&quot;toolbar&quot;, then those pat- terns need an extra
level for the form-widget which holds the toolbar and vt100
widget. A wildcard between the top-level &quot;XTerm&quot;
and the &quot;vt100&quot; widget makes the resource settings
work for either, e.g., &quot;XTerm*vt100.NAME&quot;.</p>

<p>activeIcon (class ActiveIcon) Specifies whether or not
active icon windows are to be used when the xterm window is
iconified, if this feature is compiled into xterm. The
active icon is a miniature representation of the content of
the window and will update as the content changes. Not all
window managers necessarily support applica- tion icon
windows. Some window managers will allow you to enter
keystrokes into the active icon window. The default is
false.</p>

<p>allowC1Printable (class AllowC1Printable) If true,
overrides the mapping of C1 controls (codes 128-159) to make
them be treated as if they were printable characters.
Although this corresponds to no particular standard, some
users insist it is a VT100. The default is false.</p>

<p>allowFontOps (class AllowFontOps) Specifies whether
control sequences that set/query the font should be allowed.
The default is true.</p>

<p>allowSendEvents (class AllowSendEvents) Specifies
whether or not synthetic key and button events (gen- erated
using the X protocol SendEvent request) should be inter-
preted or discarded. The default is false meaning they are
discarded. Note that allowing such events creates a very
large security hole, and forcefully disables the allowXXXOps
resources. The default is false.</p>

<p>allowTcapOps (class AllowTcapOps) Specifies whether
control sequences that query the terminals notion of its
function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo capabilities
should be allowed. The default is false.</p>

<p>A few programs, e.g,. vim, use this feature to get an
accurate description of the terminal s capabilities,
independent of the termcap/terminfo setting:</p>

<p>- xterm can tell the querying program how many colors it
sup- ports. This is a constant, depending on how it is
compiled, typically 16. It does not change if you alter
resource set- tings, e.g., the boldColors resource.</p>

<p>- xterm can tell the querying program what strings are
sent by modified (shift-, control-, alt-) function- and
keypad-keys. Reporting control- and alt-modifiers is a
feature that relies on the ncurses extended naming.</p>

<p>allowTitleOps (class AllowTitleOps) Specifies whether
control sequences that modify the window title or icon name
should be allowed. The default is true.</p>

<p>allowWindowOps (class AllowWindowOps) Specifies whether
extended window control sequences (as used in dtterm) should
be allowed. These include several control sequences which
manipulate the window size or position, as well as reporting
these values and the title or icon name. Each of these can
be abused in a script; curiously enough most terminal
emulators that implement these restrict only a small part of
the repertoire. For fine-tuning, see disallowedWindowOps.
The default is false.</p>

<p>altIsNotMeta (class AltIsNotMeta) If true, treat the
Alt-key as if it were the Meta-key. Your keyboard may happen
to be configured so they are the same. But if they are not,
this allows you to use the same prefix- and shifting
operations with the Alt-key as with the Meta-key. See
altSendsEscape and metaSendsEscape. The default is
false.</p>

<p>altSendsEscape (class AltSendsEscape) This is an
additional keyboard operation that may be processed after
the logic for metaSendsEscape. It is only available if the
altIsNotMeta resource is set.</p>

<p>If true, Alt characters (a character combined with the
modi- fier associated with left/right Alt-keys) are
converted into a two-character sequence with the character
itself preceded by ESC. This applies as well to function key
control sequences, unless xterm sees that Alt is used in
your key translations. If false , Alt characters input from
the keyboard cause a shift to 8-bit characters (just like
metaSendsEscape). By com- bining the Alt- and
Meta-modifiers, you can create correspond- ing combinations
of ESC-prefix and 8-bit characters. The default is
false.</p>

<p>alwaysBoldMode (class AlwaysBoldMode) Specifies whether
xterm should check if the normal and bold fonts are distinct
before deciding whether to use overstriking to simulate bold
fonts. If this resource is true, xterm does not make the
check for distinct fonts when deciding how to han- dle the
boldMode resource. The default is false.</p>

<p>boldMode alwaysBoldMode Comparison Action
---------------------------------------------------- false
false ignored use font false true ignored use font true
false same overstrike true false different use font true
true ignored overstrike</p>

<p>alwaysHighlight (class AlwaysHighlight) Specifies
whether or not xterm should always display a high- lighted
text cursor. By default (if this resource is false), a
hollow text cursor is displayed whenever the pointer moves
out of the window or the window loses the input focus. The
default is false.</p>

<p>alwaysUseMods (class AlwaysUseMods) Override the numLock
resource, telling xterm to use the Alt and Meta modifiers to
construct parameters for function key sequences even if
those modifiers appear in the translations resource. The
default is false.</p>

<p>answerbackString (class AnswerbackString) Specifies the
string that xterm sends in response to an ENQ (control/E)
character from the host. The default is a blank string,
i.e., . A hardware VT100 implements this feature as a setup
option.</p>

<p>appcursorDefault (class AppcursorDefault) If true, the
cursor keys are initially in application mode. This is the
same as the VT102 private DECCKM mode, The default is
false.</p>

<p>appkeypadDefault (class AppkeypadDefault) If true, the
keypad keys are initially in application mode. The default
is false.</p>

<p>autoWrap (class AutoWrap) Specifies whether or not
auto-wraparound should be enabled. This is the same as the
VT102 DECAWM. The default is true.</p>

<p>awaitInput (class AwaitInput) Specifies whether or not
the xterm uses a 50 millisecond time- out to await input
(i.e., to support the Xaw3d arrow scroll- bar). The default
is false.</p>

<p>backarrowKey (class BackarrowKey) Specifies whether the
backarrow key transmits a backspace (8) or delete (127)
character. This corresponds to the DECBKM con- trol
sequence. The default (backspace) is true. Pressing the
control key toggles this behavior.</p>

<p>background (class Background) Specifies the color to use
for the background of the window. The default is
XtDefaultBackground.</p>

<p>bellIsUrgent (class BellIsUrgent) Specifies whether to
set the Urgency hint for the window man- ager when making a
bell sound. The default is false.</p>

<p>bellOnReset (class BellOnReset) Specifies whether to
sound a bell when doing a hard reset. The default is
true.</p>

<p>bellSuppressTime (class BellSuppressTime) Number of
milliseconds after a bell command is sent during which
additional bells will be suppressed. Default is 200. If set
non-zero, additional bells will also be suppressed until the
server reports that processing of the first bell has been
completed; this feature is most useful with the visible
bell.</p>

<p>boldColors (class ColorMode) Specifies whether to
combine bold attribute with colors like the IBM PC, i.e.,
map colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through 15. These
normally are the brighter versions of the first 8 colors,
hence bold. The default is true.</p>

<p>boldFont (class BoldFont) Specifies the name of the bold
font to use instead of over- striking. There is no default
for this resource.</p>

<p>boldMode (class BoldMode) This specifies whether or not
text with the bold attribute should be overstruck to
simulate bold fonts if the resolved bold font is the same as
the normal font. It may be desirable to disable bold fonts
when color is being used for the bold attribute.</p>

<p>Note that xterm has one bold font which you may set
explicitly. Xterm attempts to derive a bold font for the
other font selec- tions (font1 through font6). If it cannot
find a bold font, it will use the normal font. In each case
(whether the explicit resource or the derived font), if the
normal and bold fonts are distinct, this resource has no
effect. The default is true.</p>

<p>See the alwaysBoldMode resource which can modify the
behavior of this resource.</p>

<p>Although xterm attempts to derive a bold font for other
font selections, the font server may not cooperate. Since
X11R6, bitmap fonts have been scaled. The font server claims
to pro- vide the bold font that xterm requests, but the
result is not always readable. XFree86 provides a feature
which can be used to suppress the scaling. In the X server s
configuration file (e.g., /etc/X11/xorg.conf), you can add
&quot;:unscaled&quot; to the end of the directory
specification for the &quot;misc&quot; fonts, which com-
prise the fixed-pitch fonts that are used by xterm. For
exam- ple FontPath &quot;/usr/share/X11/fonts&quot;</p>

<p>would become FontPath
&quot;/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled&quot;</p>

<p>Depending on your configuration, the font server may
have its own configuration file. The same
&quot;:unscaled&quot; can be added to its configuration file
at the end of the directory specifica- tion for
&quot;misc&quot;.</p>

<p>The bitmap scaling feature is also used by xterm to
implement VT102 double-width and double-height
characters.</p>

<p>brokenLinuxOSC (class BrokenLinuxOSC) If true, xterm
applies a workaround to ignore malformed control sequences
that a Linux script might send. Compare the palette control
sequences documented in console_codes with ECMA-48. The
default is true.</p>

<p>brokenSelections (class BrokenSelections) If true, xterm
in 8-bit mode will interpret STRING selections as carrying
text in the current locale s encoding. Normally STRING
selections carry ISO-8859-1 encoded text. Setting this
resource to true violates the ICCCM; it may, however, be
use- ful for interacting with some broken X clients. The
default is false.</p>

<p>brokenStringTerm (class BrokenStringTerm) provides a
work-around for some ISDN routers which start an application
control string without completing it. Set this to true if
xterm appears to freeze when connecting. The default is
false.</p>

<p>c132 (class C132) Specifies whether or not the VT102
DECCOLM escape sequence, used to switch between 80 and 132
columns, should be honored. The default is false.</p>

<p>cacheDoublesize (class CacheDoublesize) Tells whether to
cache double-sized fonts by xterm. Set this to zero to
disable double-sized fonts altogether.</p>

<p>charClass (class CharClass) Specifies comma-separated
lists of character class bindings of the form
[low-]high:value. These are used in determining which sets
of characters should be treated the same when doing cut and
paste. See the CHARACTER CLASSES section.</p>

<p>cjkWidth (class CjkWidth) Specifies whether xterm should
follow the traditional East Asian width convention. When
turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category
in UTR 11 have a column width of 2. You may have to set this
option to true if you have some old East Asian terminal
based programs that assume that line- drawing characters
have a column width of 2. If this resource is false, the
mkWidth resource controls the choice between the systems
wcwidth and xterms built-in tables. The default is
false.</p>

<p>color0 (class Color0)</p>

<p>color1 (class Color1)</p>

<p>color2 (class Color2)</p>

<p>color3 (class Color3)</p>

<p>color4 (class Color4)</p>

<p>color5 (class Color5)</p>

<p>color6 (class Color6)</p>

<p>color7 (class Color7) These specify the colors for the
ISO-6429 extension. The defaults are, respectively, black,
red3, green3, yellow3, a customizable dark blue, magenta3,
cyan3, and gray90. The default shades of color are chosen to
allow the colors 8-15 to be used as brighter versions.</p>

<p>color8 (class Color8)</p>

<p>color9 (class Color9)</p>

<p>color10 (class Color10)</p>

<p>color11 (class Color11)</p>

<p>color12 (class Color12)</p>

<p>color13 (class Color13)</p>

<p>color14 (class Color14)</p>

<p>color15 (class Color15) These specify the colors for the
ISO-6429 extension if the bold attribute is also enabled.
The default resource values are respectively, gray30, red,
green, yellow, a customizable light blue, magenta, cyan, and
white.</p>

<p>color16 (class Color16)</p>

<p>through</p>

<p>color255 (class Color255) These specify the colors for
the 256-color extension. The default resource values are for
colors 16 through 231 to make a 6x6x6 color cube, and colors
232 through 255 to make a grayscale ramp.</p>

<p>Resources past color15 are available as a compile-time
option. Due to a hardcoded limit in the X libraries on the
total number of resources (to 400), the resources for
256-colors are omitted when wide-character support and luit
are enabled. Besides inconsistent behavior if only part of
the resources were allowed, determining the exact cutoff is
difficult, and the X libraries tend to crash if the number
of resources exceeds the limit. The color palette is still
initialized to the same default values, and can be modified
via control sequences.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the resource limit does permit
including the entire range for 88-colors.</p>

<p>colorAttrMode (class ColorAttrMode) Specifies whether
colorBD, colorBL, colorRV, and colorUL should override ANSI
colors. If not, these are displayed only when no ANSI colors
have been set for the corresponding position. The default is
false.</p>

<p>colorBD (class ColorBD) This specifies the color to use
to display bold characters if the colorBDMode resource is
enabled. The default is XtDe- faultForeground.</p>

<p>colorBDMode (class ColorAttrMode) Specifies whether
characters with the bold attribute should be displayed in
color or as bold characters. Note that setting colorMode off
disables all colors, including bold. The default is
false.</p>

<p>colorBL (class ColorBL) This specifies the color to use
to display blink characters if the colorBLMode resource is
enabled. The default is XtDe- faultForeground.</p>

<p>colorBLMode (class ColorAttrMode) Specifies whether
characters with the blink attribute should be displayed in
color. Note that setting colorMode off disables all colors,
including this. The default is false.</p>

<p>colorMode (class ColorMode) Specifies whether or not
recognition of ANSI (ISO-6429) color change escape sequences
should be enabled. The default is true.</p>

<p>colorRV (class ColorRV) This specifies the color to use
to display reverse characters if the colorRVMode resource is
enabled. The default is XtDefaultForeground.</p>

<p>colorRVMode (class ColorAttrMode) Specifies whether
characters with the reverse attribute should be displayed in
color. Note that setting colorMode off dis- ables all
colors, including this. The default is false.</p>

<p>colorUL (class ColorUL) This specifies the color to use
to display underlined charac- ters if the colorULMode
resource is enabled. The default is XtDefaultForeground.</p>

<p>colorULMode (class ColorAttrMode) Specifies whether
characters with the underline attribute should be displayed
in color or as underlined characters. Note that setting
colorMode off disables all colors, including underlining.
The default is false.</p>

<p>combiningChars (class CombiningChars) Specifies the
number of wide-characters which can be stored in a cell to
overstrike (combine) with the base character of the cell.
This can be set to values in the range 0 to 4. The default
is 2.</p>

<p>ctrlFKeys (class CtrlFKeys) In VT220 keyboard mode (see
sunKeyboard resource), specifies the amount by which to
shift F1-F12 given a control modifier (CTRL). This allows
you to generate key symbols for F10-F20 on a Sun/PC
keyboard. The default is 10, which means that CTRL F1
generates the key symbol for F11.</p>

<p>curses (class Curses) Specifies whether or not the last
column bug in more(1) should be worked around. See the -cu
option for details. The default is false.</p>

<p>cursorBlink (class CursorBlink) Specifies whether to
make the cursor blink. The default is false.</p>

<p>cursorColor (class CursorColor) Specifies the color to
use for the text cursor. The default is XtDefaultForeground.
By default, xterm attempts to keep this color from being the
same as the background color, since it draws the cursor by
filling the background of a text cell. The same restriction
applies to control sequences which may change this
color.</p>

<p>Setting this resource overrides most of xterms
adjustments to cursor color. It will still use reverse-video
to disallow some cases, such as a black cursor on a black
background.</p>

<p>cursorOffTime (class CursorOffTime) Specifies the
duration of the &quot;off&quot; part of the cursor blink
cycle-time in milliseconds. The same timer is used for text
blinking. The default is 300.</p>

<p>cursorOnTime (class CursorOnTime) Specifies the duration
of the &quot;on&quot; part of the cursor blink cycle-time,
in milliseconds. The same timer is used for text blinking.
The default is 600.</p>

<p>cutNewline (class CutNewline) If false, triple clicking
to select a line does not include the Newline at the end of
the line. If true, the Newline is selected. The default is
true.</p>

<p>cursorUnderLine (class CursorUnderLine) Specifies
whether to make the cursor underlined or a box. The default
is false.</p>

<p>cutToBeginningOfLine (class CutToBeginningOfLine) If
false, triple clicking to select a line selects only from
the current word forward. If true , the entire line is
selected. The default is true.</p>

<p>decTerminalID (class DecTerminalID) Specifies the
emulation level (100=VT100, 220=VT220, etc.), used to
determine the type of response to a DA control sequence.
Leading non-digit characters are ignored, e.g.,
&quot;vt100&quot; and &quot;100&quot; are the same. The
default is 100.</p>

<p>defaultString (class DefaultString) Specify the
character (or string) which xterm will substitute when
pasted text includes a character which cannot be repre-
sented in the current encoding. For instance, pasting UTF-8
text into a display of ISO-8859-1 characters will only be
able to display codes 0-255, while UTF-8 text can include
Unicode values above 255. The default is # (a single pound
sign).</p>

<p>If the undisplayable text would be double-width, xterm
will add a space after the # character, to give roughly the
same layout on the screen as the original text.</p>

<p>deleteIsDEL (class DeleteIsDEL) Specifies whether the
Delete key on the editing keypad should send DEL (127) or
the VT220-style Remove escape sequence. The default is
false, for the latter.</p>

<p>disallowedWindowOps (class DisallowedWindowOps) Specify
which features will be disabled if allowWindowOps is false.
This is a comma-separated list of names, or (for the
controls adapted from dtterm the operation number). The
default value is 20,21,SetXprop,SetSelection</p>

<p>The names are listed below. xterm ignores
capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for
clarity. Where a number can be used as an alternative, it is
given in parentheses after the name.</p>

<p>GetIconTitle (20) Report xterm windows icon label as a
string.</p>

<p>GetScreenSizeChars (19) Report the size of the screen in
characters as numbers.</p>

<p>GetSelection Report selection data as a base64
string.</p>

<p>GetWinPosition (13) Report xterm window position as
numbers.</p>

<p>GetWinSizeChars (18) Report the size of the text area in
characters as numbers.</p>

<p>GetWinSizePixels (14) Report xterm window in pixels as
numbers.</p>

<p>GetWinState (11) Report xterm window state as a
number.</p>

<p>GetWinTitle (21) Report xterm windows title as a
string.</p>

<p>LowerWin (6) Lower the xterm window to the bottom of the
stacking order.</p>

<p>MaximizeWin (9) Maximize window (i.e., resize to screen
size).</p>

<p>MinimizeWin (2) Iconify window.</p>

<p>PopTitle (23) Pop title from internal stack.</p>

<p>PushTitle (22) Push title to internal stack.</p>

<p>RaiseWin (5) Raise the xterm window to the front of the
stacking order.</p>

<p>RefreshWin (7) Refresh the xterm window.</p>

<p>RestoreWin (1) De-iconify window.</p>

<p>SetSelection Set selection data.</p>

<p>SetWinLines Resize to a given number of lines, at least
24.</p>

<p>SetWinPosition (3) Move window to given coordinates.</p>

<p>SetWinSizeChars (8) Resize the text area to given size
in characters.</p>

<p>SetWinSizePixels (4) Resize the xterm window to given
size in pixels.</p>

<p>SetXprop Set X property on top-level window.</p>

<p>dynamicColors (class DynamicColors) Specifies whether or
not escape sequences to change colors assigned to different
attributes are recognized.</p>

<p>eightBitControl (class EightBitControl) Specifies
whether or not control sequences sent by the terminal should
be eight-bit characters or escape sequences. The default is
false.</p>

<p>eightBitInput (class EightBitInput) If true , Meta
characters (a single-byte character combined with the Meta
modifier key) input from the keyboard are pre- sented as a
single character with the eighth bit turned on. The terminal
is put into 8-bit mode. If false , Meta charac- ters are
converted into a two-character sequence with the char- acter
itself preceded by ESC. On startup, xterm tries to put the
terminal into 7-bit mode. The metaSendsEscape and altSend-
sEscape resources may override this. The default is
true.</p>

<p>Generally keyboards do not have a key labeled
&quot;Meta&quot;, but &quot;Alt&quot; keys are common, and
they are conventionally used for &quot;Meta&quot;. If they
were synonymous, it would have been reasonable to name this
resource &quot;altSendsEscape&quot;, reversing its sense.
For more background on this, see the meta function in
curses.</p>

<p>Note that the Alt key is not necessarily the same as the
Meta modifier. xmodmap lists your key modifiers. X defines
modi- fiers for shift, (caps) lock and control, as well as 5
addi- tional modifiers which are generally used to configure
key mod- ifiers. xterm inspects the same information to find
the modi- fier associated with either Meta key (left or
right), and uses that key as the Meta modifier. It also
looks for the NumLock key, to recognize the modifier which
is associated with that.</p>

<p>If your xmodmap configuration uses the same keycodes for
Alt- and Meta-keys, xterm will only see the Alt-key
definitions, since those are tested before Meta-keys.
NumLock is tested first. It is important to keep these keys
distinct; otherwise some of xterms functionality is not
available.</p>

<p>eightBitOutput (class EightBitOutput) Specifies whether
or not eight-bit characters sent from the host should be
accepted as is or stripped when printed. The default is
true, which means that they are accepted as is.</p>

<p>eightBitSelectTypes (class EightBitSelectTypes) Override
xterm s default selection target list (see SELECT/PASTE) for
selections in normal (ISO-8859-1) mode. The default is an
empty string, which does not override anything.</p>

<p>faceName (class FaceName) Specify the pattern for fonts
selected from the FreeType library if support for that
library was compiled into xterm. There is no default. If not
specified, or if there is no match for both normal and bold
fonts, xterm uses the font and related resources.</p>

<p>faceNameDoublesize (class FaceNameDoublesize) Specify an
double-width font for cases where an application requires
this, e.g., in CJK applications. There is no default. If the
application uses double-wide characters and this resource is
not given, xterm will use a scaled version of the font given
by faceName.</p>

<p>faceSize (class FaceSize) Specify the pointsize for
fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that
library was compiled into xterm. The default is 14. On the
VT Fonts menu, this corresponds to the Default entry.</p>

<p>You can specify the pointsize for TrueType fonts
selected with the other size-related menu entries such as
Medium, Huge, etc., by using one of the following resource
values. If you do not specify a value, they default to 0.0,
which causes xterm to use the ratio of font sizes from the
corresponding bitmap font resources to obtain a TrueType
pointsize.</p>

<p>If all of the faceSize resources are set, then xterm
will use this information to determine the next
smaller/larger TrueType font for the larger-vt-font() and
smaller-vt-font() actions. If any are not set, xterm will
use only the areas of the bitmap fonts.</p>

<p>faceSize1 (class FaceSize1) Specifies the pointsize of
the first alternative font.</p>

<p>faceSize2 (class FaceSize2) Specifies the pointsize of
the second alternative font.</p>

<p>faceSize3 (class FaceSize3) Specifies the pointsize of
the third alternative font.</p>

<p>faceSize4 (class FaceSize4) Specifies the pointsize of
the fourth alternative font.</p>

<p>faceSize5 (class FaceSize5) Specifies the pointsize of
the fifth alternative font.</p>

<p>faceSize6 (class FaceSize6) Specifies the pointsize of
the sixth alternative font.</p>

<p>font (class Font) Specifies the name of the normal font.
The default is fixed.</p>

<p>See the discussion of the locale resource, which
describes how this font may be overridden.</p>

<p>NOTE: some resource files use patterns such as *font:
fixed</p>

<p>which are overly broad, affecting both
xterm.vt100.font</p>

<p>and xterm.vt100.utf8fonts.font</p>

<p>which is probably not what you intended.</p>

<p>fastScroll (class FastScroll) Modifies the effect of
jump scroll (jumpScroll) by suppressing screen refreshes for
the special case when output to the screen has completely
shifted the contents off-screen. For instance, cating a
large file to the screen does this.</p>

<p>font1 (class Font1) Specifies the name of the first
alternative font.</p>

<p>font2 (class Font2) Specifies the name of the second
alternative font.</p>

<p>font3 (class Font3) Specifies the name of the third
alternative font.</p>

<p>font4 (class Font4) Specifies the name of the fourth
alternative font.</p>

<p>font5 (class Font5) Specifies the name of the fifth
alternative font.</p>

<p>font6 (class Font6) Specifies the name of the sixth
alternative font.</p>

<p>fontDoublesize (class FontDoublesize) Specifies whether
xterm should attempt to use font scaling to draw
double-sized characters. Some older font servers cannot do
this properly, will return misleading font metrics. The
default is true . If disabled, xterm will simulate double-
sized characters by drawing normal characters with spaces
between them.</p>

<p>fontWarnings (class FontWarnings) Specify whether xterm
should report an error if it fails to load a font:</p>

<p>0 Never report an error (though the X libraries
may).</p>

<p>1 Report an error if the font name was given as a
resource setting.</p>

<p>2 Always report an error on failure to load a font.</p>

<p>forceBoxChars (class ForceBoxChars) Specifies whether
xterm should assume the normal and bold fonts have VT100
line-drawing characters:</p>

<p>- The fixed-pitch ISO-8859-*-encoded fonts used by xterm
normally have the VT100 line-drawing glyphs in cells 1-31.
Other fixed-pitch fonts may be more attractive, but lack
these glyphs.</p>

<p>- When using an ISO-10646-1 font and the wideChars
resource is true, xterm uses the Unicode glyphs which match
the VT100 line-drawing glyphs.</p>

<p>If false, xterm checks for missing glyphs in the font
and makes line-drawing characters directly as needed. If
true, xterm assumes the font does not contain the
line-drawing char- acters, and draws them directly. The
default is false.</p>

<p>forcePackedFont (class ForcePackedFont) Specifies
whether xterm should use the maximum or minimum glyph width
when displaying using a bitmap font. Use the maximum width
to help with proportional fonts. The default is true,
denoting the minimum width.</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) Specifies the color to use
for displaying text in the window. Setting the class name
instead of the instance name is an easy way to have
everything that would normally appear in the text color
change color. The default is XtDefaultForeground.</p>

<p>formatOtherKeys (class FormatOtherKeys) Overrides the
format of the escape sequence used to report mod- ified keys
with the modifyOtherKeys resource.</p>

<p>0 send modified keys as parameters for function-key 27
(default).</p>

<p>1 send modified keys as parameters for CSI u.</p>

<p>freeBoldBox (class FreeBoldBox) Specifies whether xterm
should assume the bounding boxes for normal and bold fonts
are compatible. If false , xterm com- pares them and will
reject choices of bold fonts that do not match the size of
the normal font. The default is false, which means that the
comparison is performed.</p>

<p>geometry (class Geometry) Specifies the preferred size
and position of the VT102 window. There is no default for
this resource.</p>

<p>highlightColor (class HighlightColor) Specifies the
color to use for the background of selected (highlighted)
text. If not specified (i.e., matching the default
foreground), reverse video is used. The default is
XtDefaultForeground.</p>

<p>highlightColorMode (class HighlightColorMode) Specifies
whether xterm should use highlightTextColor and high-
lightColor to override the reversed foreground/background
col- ors in a selection. The default is unspecified: at
startup, xterm checks if those resources are set to
something other than the default foreground and background
colors. Setting this resource disables the check.</p>

<p>The following table shows the interaction of the
highlighting resources, abbreviated as shown to fit in this
page:</p>

<p>HCM highlightColorMode</p>

<p>HR highlightReverse</p>

<p>HBG highlightColor</p>

<p>HFG highlightTextColor</p>

<p>HCM HR HBG HFG Highlight
------------------------------------------------------ false

HFG/HBG
------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>highlightReverse (class HighlightReverse) Specifies
whether xterm should reverse the selection foreground and
background colors when selecting text with reverse-video
attribute. This applies only to the highlightColor and high-
lightTextColor resources, e.g., to match the color scheme of
xwsh. If true, xterm reverses the colors, If false, xterm
does not reverse colors, The default is true.</p>

<p>highlightSelection (class HighlightSelection) If false,
selecting with the mouse highlights all positions on the
screen between the beginning of the selection and the
current position. If true, xterm highlights only the posi-
tions that contain text that can be selected. The default is
false.</p>

<p>Depending on the way your applications write to the
screen, there may be trailing blanks on a line. Xterm stores
data as it is shown on the screen. Erasing the display
changes the internal state of each cell so it is not
considered a blank for the purpose of selection. Blanks
written since the last erase are selectable. If you do not
wish to have trailing blanks in a selection, use the
trimSelection resource.</p>

<p>highlightTextColor (class HighlightTextColor) Specifies
the color to use for the foreground of selected
(highlighted) text. If not specified (i.e., matching the
default background), reverse video is used. The default is
XtDefaultBackground.</p>

<p>hpLowerleftBugCompat (class HpLowerleftBugCompat)
Specifies whether to work around a bug in HP s xdb, which
ignores termcap and always sends ESC F to move to the lower
left corner. true causes xterm to interpret ESC F as a
request to move to the lower left corner of the screen. The
default is false.</p>

<p>i18nSelections (class I18nSelections) If false, xterm
will not request the targets COMPOUND_TEXT or TEXT. The
default is true. It may be set to false in order to work
around ICCCM violations by other X clients.</p>

<p>iconBorderColor (class BorderColor) Specifies the border
color for the active icon window if this feature is compiled
into xterm. Not all window managers will make the icon
border visible.</p>

<p>iconBorderWidth (class BorderWidth) Specifies the border
width for the active icon window if this feature is compiled
into xterm. The default is 2. Not all window managers will
make the border visible.</p>

<p>iconFont (class IconFont) Specifies the font for the
miniature active icon window, if this feature is compiled
into xterm. The default is &quot;nil2&quot;.</p>

<p>initialFont (class InitialFont) Specifies which of the
VT100 fonts to use initially. Values are the same as for the
set-vt-font action. The default is d, i.e.,
&quot;default&quot;.</p>

<p>inputMethod (class XtCInputMethod) Tells xterm which
type of input method to use. There is no default method.</p>

<p>internalBorder (class BorderWidth) Specifies the number
of pixels between the characters and the window border. The
default is 2.</p>

<p>italicULMode (class ColorAttrMode) Specifies whether
characters with the underline attribute should be displayed
in an italic font or as underlined charac- ters. It is
implemented only for TrueType fonts.</p>

<p>jumpScroll (class JumpScroll) Specifies whether or not
jump scroll should be used. This cor- responds to the VT102
DECSCLM private mode. The default is true. See fastScroll
for a variation.</p>

<p>keepSelection (class KeepSelection) Specifies whether
xterm will keep the selection even after the selected area
was touched by some output to the terminal. The default is
true.</p>

<p>keyboardDialect (class KeyboardDialect) Specifies the
initial keyboard dialect, as well as the default value when
the terminal is reset. The value given is the same as the
final character in the control sequences which change
character sets. The default is B , which corresponds to US
ASCII.</p>

<p>nameKeymap (class NameKeymap) See the discussion of the
keymap() action.</p>

<p>limitResize (class LimitResize) Limits resizing of the
screen via control sequence to a given multiple of the
display dimensions. The default is 1.</p>

<p>locale (class Locale) Specifies how to use luit, an
encoding converter between UTF-8 and locale encodings. The
resource value (ignoring case) may be:</p>

<p>true xterm will use the encoding specified by the users
LC_CTYPE locale (i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG variables)
as far as possible. This is realized by always enabling
UTF-8 mode and invoking luit in non-UTF-8 locales.</p>

<p>medium xterm will follow users LC_CTYPE locale only for
UTF-8, east Asian, and Thai locales, where the encodings
were not supported by conventional 8bit mode with changing
fonts. For other locales, xterm will use conventional 8bit
mode.</p>

<p>checkfont If mini-luit is compiled-in, xterm will check
if a Unicode font has been specified. If so, it checks if
the character encoding for the current locale is POSIX,
Latin-1 or Latin-9, uses the appropriate mapping to support
those with the Unicode font. For other encodings, xterm
assumes that UTF-8 encoding is required.</p>

<p>false xterm will use conventional 8bit mode or UTF-8
mode accord- ing to utf8 resource or -u8 option.</p>

<p>Any other value, e.g., UTF-8 or ISO8859-2 , is assumed
to be an encoding name; luit will be invoked to support the
encoding. The actual list of supported encodings depends on
luit. The default is medium.</p>

<p>Regardless of your locale and encoding, you need an
ISO-10646-1 font to display the result. Your configuration
may not include this font, or locale-support by xterm may
not be needed. At startup, xterm uses a mechanism equivalent
to the load-vt- fonts(utf8Fonts, Utf8Fonts) action to load
font name subre- sources of the VT100 widget. That is,
resource patterns such as &quot;*vt100.utf8Fonts.font&quot;
will be loaded, and (if this resource is enabled), override
the normal fonts. If no subre- sources are found, the normal
fonts such as &quot;*vt100.font&quot;, etc., are used. The
resource files distributed with xterm use ISO-10646-1 fonts,
but do not rely on them unless you are using the locale
mechanism.</p>

<p>localeFilter (class LocaleFilter) Specifies the file
name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings and
UTF-8 which is used with the -lc option or locale resource.
The help message shown by xterm -help lists the default
value, which depends on your system configuration.</p>

<p>If the encoding converter requires command-line
parameters, you should put those within a shell script to
execute the con- verter, and set this resource to point to
the shell script.</p>

<p>loginShell (class LoginShell) Specifies whether or not
the shell to be run in the window should be started as a
login shell. The default is false.</p>

<p>marginBell (class MarginBell) Specifies whether or not
the bell should be rung when the user types near the right
margin. The default is false.</p>

<p>metaSendsEscape (class MetaSendsEscape) If true , Meta
characters (a character combined with the Meta modifier key)
are converted into a two-character sequence with the
character itself preceded by ESC. This applies as well to
function key control sequences, unless xterm sees that Meta
is used in your key translations. If false, Meta characters
input from the keyboard are handled according to the
eightBit- Input resource. The default is false.</p>

<p>mkSamplePass (class MkSamplePass) If mkSampleSize is
nonzero, and mkWidth (and cjkWidth) are false, on startup
xterm compares its built-in tables to the system s wide
character width data to decide if it will use the systems
data. It tests the first mkSampleSize character val- ues,
and allows up to mkSamplePass mismatches before the test
fails. The default (for the allowed number of mismatches) is
256.</p>

<p>mkSampleSize (class MkSampleSize) With mkSamplePass,
this specifies a startup test used for ini- tializing wide
character width calculations. The default (num- ber of
characters to check) is 1024.</p>

<p>mkWidth (class MkWidth) Specifies whether xterm should
use a built-in version of the wide character width
calculation. See also the cjkWidth resource which can
override this. The default is false.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the resources which control the
choice of wide character width calculation:</p>

<p>cjkWidth mkWidth Action
---------------------------------------------------------------
false false use system tables subject to mkSamplePass false
true use built-in tables true false use built-in CJK tables
true true use built-in CJK tables</p>

<p>modifyCursorKeys (class ModifyCursorKeys) Tells how to
handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt- or
Meta-modifiers are used to add a parameter to the escape
sequence returned by a cursor-key. The default is 2:</p>

<p>Set it to -1 to disable it. Set it to 0 to use the
old/obsolete behavior. Set it to 1 to prefix modified
sequences with CSI. Set it to 2 to force the modifier to be
the second parameter if it would otherwise be the first. Set
it to 3 to mark the sequence with a &gt; to hint that it is
private.</p>

<p>modifyFunctionKeys (class ModifyFunctionKeys) Tells how
to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt- or
Meta-modifiers are used to add a parameter to the escape
sequence returned by a (numbered) function-key. The default
is 2. The resource values are similar to modifyCur-
sorKeys:</p>

<p>Set it to -1 to permit the user to use shift- and
control-modi- fiers to construct function-key strings using
the normal encod- ing scheme. Set it to 0 to use the
old/obsolete behavior. Set it to 1 to prefix modified
sequences with CSI. Set it to 2 to force the modifier to be
the second parameter if it would otherwise be the first. Set
it to 3 to mark the sequence with a &gt; to hint that it is
private.</p>

<p>If modifyFunctionKeys is zero, xterm uses Control- and
Shift- modifiers to allow the user to construct numbered
function-keys beyond the set provided by the keyboard:</p>

<p>Control adds the value given by the ctrlFKeys
resource.</p>

<p>Shift adds twice the value given by the ctrlFKeys
resource.</p>

<p>Control/Shift adds three times the value given by the
ctrlFKeys resource.</p>

<p>As a special case, legacy (when oldFunctionKeys is true)
or vt220 (when sunKeyboard is true) keyboards interpret only
the Control-modifier when constructing numbered
function-keys. This is done to provide compatible keyboards
for DEC VT220 and related terminals that implement
user-defined keys (UDK).</p>

<p>modifyOtherKeys (class ModifyOtherKeys) Like
modifyCursorKeys, tells xterm to construct an escape
sequence for other keys (such as &quot;2&quot;) when
modified by Con- trol-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers. This feature
does not apply to function keys and well-defined keys such
as ESC or the control keys. The default is 0:</p>

<p>0 disables this feature.</p>

<p>1 enables this feature for keys except for those with
well- known behavior, e.g., Tab, Backarrow and some special
con- trol character cases, e.g., Control-Space to make a
NUL.</p>

<p>2 enables this feature for keys including the exceptions
listed.</p>

<p>multiClickTime (class MultiClickTime) Specifies the
maximum time in milliseconds between multi-click select
events. The default is 250 milliseconds.</p>

<p>multiScroll (class MultiScroll) Specifies whether or not
scrolling should be done asyn- chronously. The default is
false.</p>

<p>nMarginBell (class Column) Specifies the number of
characters from the right margin at which the margin bell
should be rung, when enabled by the marginBell resource. The
default is 10.</p>

<p>numLock (class NumLock) If true, xterm checks if NumLock
is used as a modifier (see xmodmap(1)). If so, this modifier
is used to simplify the logic when implementing special
NumLock for the sunKeyboard resource. Also (when sunKeyboard
is false), similar logic is used to find the modifier
associated with the left and right Alt keys. The default is
true.</p>

<p>oldXtermFKeys (class OldXtermFKeys) If true , xterm will
use old-style control sequences for func- tion keys F1 to
F4, for compatibility with X Consortium xterm. Otherwise, it
uses the VT100-style codes for PF1 to PF4. The default is
false.</p>

<p>on2Clicks (class On2Clicks)</p>

<p>on3Clicks (class On3Clicks)</p>

<p>on4Clicks (class On4Clicks)</p>

<p>on5Clicks (class On5Clicks) Specify selection behavior
in response to multiple mouse clicks. A single mouse click
is always interpreted as described in the SELECTION section
(see POINTER USAGE). Multi- ple mouse clicks (using the
button which activates the select- start action) are
interpreted according to the resource values of on2Clicks,
etc. The resource value can be one of these:</p>

<p>word Select a word as determined by the charClass
resource. See the CHARACTER CLASSES section.</p>

<p>line Select a line (counting wrapping).</p>

<p>group Select a group of adjacent lines (counting
wrapping). The selection stops on a blank line, and does not
extend outside the current page.</p>

<p>page Select all visible lines, i.e., the page.</p>

<p>all Select all lines, i.e., including the saved
lines.</p>

<p>regex Select a word as determined by the regular
expression which follows in the resource value.</p>

<p>none No selection action is associated with this
resource. xterm interprets it as the end of the list. For
example, you may use it to disable triple (and higher)
clicking by setting on3Clicks to none.</p>

<p>The default values for on2Clicks and on3Clicks are word
and line , respectively. There is no default value for
on4Clicks or on5Clicks, making those inactive. On startup,
xterm deter- mines the maximum number of clicks by the
onXClicks resource values which are set.</p>

<p>openIm (class XtCOpenIm) Tells xterm whether to open the
input method at startup. The default is true.</p>

<p>pointerColor (class PointerColor) Specifies the
foreground color of the pointer. The default is
XtDefaultForeground.</p>

<p>pointerColorBackground (class PointerColorBackground)
Specifies the background color of the pointer. The default
is XtDefaultBackground.</p>

<p>pointerMode (class PointerMode) Specifies when the
pointer may be hidden as the user types. It will be
redisplayed if the user moves the mouse, or clicks one of
its buttons.</p>

<p>0 never</p>

<p>1 the application running in xterm has not activated
mouse mode. This is the default.</p>

<p>2 always.</p>

<p>pointerShape (class Cursor) Specifies the name of the
shape of the pointer. The default is xterm.</p>

<p>popOnBell (class PopOnBell) Specifies whether the window
would be raised when Control-G is received. The default is
false.</p>

<p>preeditType (class XtCPreeditType) Tells xterm which
types of preedit (preconversion) string to display. The
default is OverTheSpot,Root.</p>

<p>printAttributes (class PrintAttributes) Specifies
whether to print graphic attributes along with the text. A
real DEC VTxxx terminal will print the underline,
highlighting codes but your printer may not handle these. A
0 disables the attributes. A 1 prints the normal set of
attributes (bold, underline, inverse and blink) as
VT100-style control sequences. A 2 prints ANSI color
attributes as well. The default is 1.</p>

<p>printerAutoClose (class PrinterAutoClose) If true ,
xterm will close the printer (a pipe) when the application
switches the printer offline with a Media Copy com- mand.
The default is false.</p>

<p>printerCommand (class PrinterCommand) Specifies a shell
command to which xterm will open a pipe when the first MC
(Media Copy) command is initiated. The default is a blank
string. If the resource value is given as a blank string,
the printer is disabled.</p>

<p>printerControlMode (class PrinterControlMode) Specifies
the printer control mode. A 1 selects autoprint mode, which
causes xterm to print a line from the screen when you move
the cursor off that line with a line feed, form feed or
vertical tab character, or an autowrap occurs. Autoprint
mode is overridden by printer controller mode (a 2), which
causes all of the output to be directed to the printer. The
default is 0.</p>

<p>printerExtent (class PrinterExtent) Controls whether a
print page function will print the entire page (true), or
only the the portion within the scrolling mar- gins (false).
The default is false.</p>

<p>printerFormFeed (class PrinterFormFeed) Controls whether
a form feed is sent to the printer at the end of a print
page function. The default is false.</p>

<p>printerNewLine (class PrinterNewLine) Controls whether a
newline is sent to the printer at the end of a print page
function. The default is true.</p>

<p>quietGrab (class QuietGrab) Controls whether the cursor
is repainted when NotifyGrab and NotifyUngrab event types
are received during change of focus. The default is
false.</p>

<p>renderFont (class RenderFont) If xterm is built with the
Xft library, this controls whether the faceName resource is
used. The default is true.</p>

<p>resizeGravity (class ResizeGravity) Affects the behavior
when the window is resized to be taller or shorter.
NorthWest specifies that the top line of text on the screen
stay fixed. If the window is made shorter, lines are dropped
from the bottom; if the window is made taller, blank lines
are added at the bottom. This is compatible with the
behavior in R4. SouthWest (the default) specifies that the
bottom line of text on the screen stay fixed. If the window
is made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down
onto the screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will
be scrolled off the top of the screen, and the top saved
lines will be dropped.</p>

<p>retryInputMethod (class XtCRetryInputMethod) Tells xterm
how many times to retry, in case the input-method server is
not responding. This is a different issue than unsupported
preedit type, etc. You may encounter retries if your X
configuration (and its libraries) are missing pieces.
Setting this resource to zero 0 will cancel the retrying.
The default is 3.</p>

<p>reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo) Specifies whether or
not reverse video should be simulated. The default is
false.</p>

<p>reverseWrap (class ReverseWrap) Specifies whether or not
reverse-wraparound should be enabled. This corresponds to
xterms private mode 45. The default is false.</p>

<p>rightScrollBar (class RightScrollBar) Specifies whether
or not the scrollbar should be displayed on the right rather
than the left. The default is false.</p>

<p>saveLines (class SaveLines) Specifies the number of
lines to save beyond the top of the screen when a scrollbar
is turned on. The default is 64.</p>

<p>scrollBar (class ScrollBar) Specifies whether or not the
scrollbar should be displayed. The default is false.</p>

<p>scrollBarBorder (class ScrollBarBorder) Specifies the
width of the scrollbar border. Note that this is drawn to
overlap the border of the xterm window. Modifying the
scrollbar s border affects only the line between the VT100
wid- get and the scrollbar. The default value is 1.</p>

<p>scrollKey (class ScrollCond) Specifies whether or not
pressing a key should automatically cause the scrollbar to
go to the bottom of the scrolling region. This corresponds
to xterm s private mode 1011. The default is false.</p>

<p>scrollLines (class ScrollLines) Specifies the number of
lines that the scroll-back and scroll- forw actions should
use as a default. The default value is 1.</p>

<p>scrollTtyOutput (class ScrollCond) Specifies whether or
not output to the terminal should automat- ically cause the
scrollbar to go to the bottom of the scrolling region. The
default is true.</p>

<p>selectToClipboard (class SelectToClipboard) Tells xterm
whether to use the PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD for SELECT tokens in
the selection mechanism. The set-select action can change
this at runtime, allowing the user to work with programs
that handle only one of these mechanisms. The default is
false, which tells it to use PRIMARY.</p>

<p>shiftFonts (class ShiftFonts) Specifies whether to
enable the actions larger-vt-font() and smaller-vt-font(),
which are normally bound to the shifted KP_Add and
KP_Subtract. The default is true.</p>

<p>showBlinkAsBold (class ShowBlinkAsBold) Tells xterm
whether to display text with blink-attribute the same as
bold. If xterm has not been configured to support blinking
text, the default is true., which corresponds to older
versions of xterm, otherwise the default is false.</p>

<p>showMissingGlyphs (class ShowMissingGlyphs) Tells xterm
whether to display a box outlining places where a character
has been used that the font does not represent. The default
is false.</p>

<p>signalInhibit (class SignalInhibit) Specifies whether or
not the entries in the Main Options menu for sending signals
to xterm should be disallowed. The default is false.</p>

<p>tekGeometry (class Geometry) Specifies the preferred
size and position of the Tektronix win- dow. There is no
default for this resource.</p>

<p>tekInhibit (class TekInhibit) Specifies whether or not
the escape sequence to enter Tektronix mode should be
ignored. The default is false.</p>

<p>tekSmall (class TekSmall) Specifies whether or not the
Tektronix mode window should start in its smallest size if
no explicit geometry is given. This is useful when running
xterm on displays with small screens. The default is
false.</p>

<p>tekStartup (class TekStartup) Specifies whether or not
xterm should start up in Tektronix mode. The default is
false.</p>

<p>tiXtraScroll (class TiXtraScroll) Specifies whether
xterm should scroll to a new page when pro- cessing the ti
termcap entry, i.e., the private modes 47, 1047 or 1049.
This is only in effect if titeInhibit is true, because the
intent of this option is to provide a picture of the
full-screen application s display on the scrollback without
wiping out the text that would be shown before the
application was initialized. The default for this resource
is false.</p>

<p>titeInhibit (class TiteInhibit) Specifies whether or not
xterm should remove ti and te termcap entries (used to
switch between alternate screens on startup of many
screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP string. If set,
xterm also ignores the escape sequence to switch to the
alternate screen. Xterm supports terminfo in a different
way, supporting composite control sequences (also known as
private modes) 1047, 1048 and 1049 which have the same
effect as the original 47 control sequence. The default for
this resource is false.</p>

<p>translations (class Translations) Specifies the key and
button bindings for menus, selections, programmed strings,
etc. The translations resource, which provides much of xterm
s configurability, is a feature of the X Toolkit Intrinsics
library (Xt). See the ACTIONS section.</p>

<p>trimSelection (class TrimSelection) If you set
highlightSelection, you can see the text which is selected,
including any trailing spaces. Clearing the screen (or a
line) resets it to a state containing no spaces. Some lines
may contain trailing spaces when an application writes them
to the screen. However, you may not wish to paste lines with
trailing spaces. If this resource is true, xterm will trim
trailing spaces from text which is selected. It does not
affect spaces which result in a wrapped line, nor will it
trim the trailing newline from your selection. The default
is false.</p>

<p>underLine (class UnderLine) This specifies whether or
not text with the underline attribute should be underlined.
It may be desirable to disable underlin- ing when color is
being used for the underline attribute. The default is
true.</p>

<p>useClipping (class UseClipping) Tell xterm whether to
use clipping to keep from producing dots outside the text
drawing area. Originally used to work around for
overstriking effects, this is also needed to work with some
incorrectly-sized fonts. The default is true.</p>

<p>utf8 (class Utf8) This specifies whether xterm will run
in UTF-8 mode. If you set this resource, xterm also sets the
wideChars resource as a side-effect. The resource is an
integer, expected to range from 0 to 3:</p>

<p>0 UTF-8 mode is initially off. The command-line option
+u8 sets the resource to this value. Escape sequences for
turn- ing UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.</p>

<p>1 UTF-8 mode is initially on. Escape sequences for
turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.</p>

<p>2 The command-line option -u8 sets the resource to this
value. Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are
ignored.</p>

<p>3 This is the default value of the resource. It is
changed during initialization depending on whether the
locale resource was set, to 0 or 2. See the locale resource
for additional discussion of non-UTF-8 locales.</p>

<p>If you want to set the value of utf8, it should be in
this range. Other nonzero values are treated the same as 1,
i.e., UTF-8 mode is initially on, and escape sequences for
turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.</p>

<p>utf8Fonts (class Utf8Fonts) See the discussion of the
locale resource.</p>

<p>utf8Latin1 (class Utf8Latin1) If true, allow an
ISO-8859-1 normal font to be combined with an ISO-10646 font
if the latter is given via the -fw option or its
corresponding resource value. The default is false.</p>

<p>utf8SelectTypes (class Utf8SelectTypes) Override xterms
default selection target list (see SELECT/PASTE) for
selections in wide-character (UTF-8) mode. The default is an
empty string, which does not override any- thing.</p>

<p>utf8Title (class Utf8Title) Applications can set xterms
title by writing a control sequence. Normally this control
sequence follows the VT220 convention, which encodes the
string in ISO-8859-1 and allows for an 8-bit string
terminator. If xterm is started in a UTF-8 locale, it
translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to work with the X
libraries which assume the string is UTF-8.</p>

<p>However, some users may wish to write a title string
encoded in UTF-8. Set this resource to true to allow UTF-8
encoded title strings. That cancels the translation to
UTF-8, allowing UTF-8 strings to be displayed as is.</p>

<p>This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is
related to the particular applications you are running
within xterm. You can also use a control sequence (see the
discussion of &quot;Title Modes&quot; in the control
sequences document), to set an equivalent flag.</p>

<p>The default is false.</p>

<p>veryBoldColors (class VeryBoldColors) Specifies whether
to combine video attributes with colors spec- ified by
colorBD, colorBL, colorRV and colorUL. The resource value is
the sum of values for each attribute: 1 for reverse, 2 for
underline, 4 for bold and 8 for blink.</p>

<p>The default is 0.</p>

<p>visualBell (class VisualBell) Specifies whether or not a
visible bell (i.e., flashing) should be used instead of an
audible bell when Control-G is received. The default is
false.</p>

<p>visualBellDelay (class VisualBellDelay) Number of
milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual bell. Default
is 100. If set to zero, no visual bell is displayed. This is
useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on a
laptop.</p>

<p>vt100Graphics (class VT100Graphics) This specifies
whether xterm will interpret VT100 graphic char- acter
escape sequences while in UTF-8 mode. The default is true ,
to provide support for various legacy applications.</p>

<p>wideBoldFont (class WideBoldFont) This option specifies
the font to be used for displaying bold wide text. By
default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the
font that will be used to draw bold text. If no double-width
font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold
font.</p>

<p>wideChars (class WideChars) Specifies if xterm should
respond to control sequences that process 16-bit characters.
The default is false.</p>

<p>wideFont (class WideFont) This option specifies the font
to be used for displaying wide text. By default, it will
attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be
used to draw normal text. If no dou- ble-width font is
found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal font.</p>

<p>ximFont (class XimFont) This option specifies the font
to be used for displaying the preedit string in the
&quot;OverTheSpot&quot; input method.</p>

<p>In &quot;OverTheSpot&quot; preedit type, the preedit
(preconversion) string is displayed at the position of the
cursor. It is the XIM servers responsibility to display the
preedit string. The XIM client must inform the XIM server of
the cursor position. For best results, the preedit string
must be displayed with a proper font. Therefore, xterm
informs the XIM server of the proper font. The font is be
supplied by a &quot;fontset&quot;, whose default value is
&quot;*&quot;. This matches every font, the X library
automatically chooses fonts with proper charsets. The
ximFont resource is provided to override this default font
setting.</p>

<p>Tek4014 Widget Resources The following resources are
specified as part of the tek4014 widget (class Tek4014).

<p>Scrollbar Resources The following resources are useful
when specified for the Athena Scrollbar widget:</p>

<p>thickness (class Thickness) Specifies the width in
pixels of the scrollbar.</p>

<p>background (class Background) Specifies the color to use
for the background of the scrollbar.</p>

<p>foreground (class Foreground) Specifies the color to use
for the foreground of the scrollbar. The thumb of the
scrollbar is a simple checkerboard pattern alternating
pixels for foreground and background color.</p>

<p>POINTER USAGE Once the VT102 window is created, xterm
allows you to select text and copy it within the same or
other windows.</p>

<p>SELECTION The selection functions are invoked when the
pointer buttons are used with no modifiers, and when they
are used with the shift key. The assignment of the functions
described below to keys and buttons may be changed through
the resource database; see ACTIONS below.</p>

<p>Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save text
into the cut buffer. Move the cursor to beginning of the
text, and then hold the button down while moving the cursor
to the end of the region and releasing the button. The
selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global cut
buffer and made the PRIMARY selection when the button is
released. Normally (but see the discussion of on2Clicks,
etc):</p>

<p>- Double-clicking selects by words.</p>

<p>- Triple-clicking selects by lines.</p>

<p>- Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.</p>

<p>Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up
to button down, so you can change the selection unit in the
middle of a selection. Logical words and lines selected by
double- or triple-clicking may wrap across more than one
screen line if lines were wrapped by xterm itself rather
than by the application running in the window. If the
key/but- ton bindings specify that an X selection is to be
made, xterm will leave the selected text highlighted for as
long as it is the selection owner.</p>

<p>Pointer button two (usually middle) types (pastes) the
text from the PRIMARY selection, if any, otherwise from the
cut buffer, inserting it as keyboard input.</p>

<p>Pointer button three (usually right) extends the current
selection. (Without loss of generality, you can swap right
and left everywhere in the rest of this paragraph.) If
pressed while closer to the right edge of the selection than
the left, it extends/contracts the right edge of the
selection. If you contract the selection past the left edge
of the selection, xterm assumes you really meant the left
edge, restores the original selection, then
extends/contracts the left edge of the selection. Extension
starts in the selection unit mode that the last selection or
extension was performed in; you can multiple-click to cycle
through them.</p>

<p>By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing
new lines, you can take text from several places in
different windows and form a com- mand to the shell, for
example, or take output from a program and insert it into
your favorite editor. Since cut buffers are globally shared
among different applications, you may regard each as a file
whose contents you know. The terminal emulator and other
text programs should be treating it as if it were a text
file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.</p>

<p>SCROLLING The scroll region displays the position and
amount of text currently showing in the window (highlighted)
relative to the amount of text actually saved. As more text
is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted
area decreases.</p>

<p>Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll
region moves the adjacent line to the top of the display
window.</p>

<p>Clicking button three moves the top line of the display
window down to the pointer position.</p>

<p>Clicking button two moves the display to a position in
the saved text that corresponds to the pointer s position in
the scrollbar.</p>

<p>TEKTRONIX POINTER Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix
window does not allow the copy- ing of text. It does allow
Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode the cursor will change
from an arrow to a cross. Pressing any key will send that
key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor. Pressing
button one, two, or three will return the letters l, m, and
r, respectively. If the shift key is pressed when a pointer
button is pressed, the corresponding upper case letter is
sent. To distinguish a pointer button from a key, the high
bit of the character is set (but this is bit is normally
stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW; see tty(4) for
details).</p>

<p>SELECT/PASTE X clients provide select and paste support
by responding to requests conveyed by the server.</p>

<p>PRIMARY When configured to use the primary selection,
(the default) xterm can provide the selection data in ways
which help to retain character encoding information as it is
pasted.</p>

<p>A user &quot;selects&quot; text on xterm, which
highlights the selected text. A subsequent &quot;paste&quot;
to another client forwards a request to the client owning
the selection. If xterm owns the primary selection, it makes
the data available in the form of one or more
&quot;selection targets&quot;. If it does not own the
primary selection, e.g., if it has released it or another
client has asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers to
pass the data. But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data
(officially - some clients ignore the rules).</p>

<p>CLIPBOARD When configured to use the clipboard (see
resource selectToClipboard), the problem with persistence of
ownership is bypassed. Otherwise, there is no difference
regarding the data which can be passed via selection.</p>

<p>SELECTION TARGETS The different types of data which are
passed depend on what the receiv- ing client asks for. These
are termed selection targets.</p>

<p>When asking for the selection data, xterm tries the
following types in this order:</p>

<p>UTF8_STRING This is an XFree86 extension, which denotes
that the data is encoded in UTF-8. When xterm is built with
wide-charac- ter support, it both accepts and provides this
type.</p>

<p>TEXT the text is in the encoding which corresponds to
your cur- rent locale.</p>

<p>COMPOUND_TEXT this is a format for multiple character
set data, such as multi-lingual text. It can store UTF-8
data as a special case.</p>

<p>STRING This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.</p>

<p>The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if
xterm is config- ured with the i18nSelections resource set
to true.</p>

<p>UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list)
since xterm stores text as Unicode data when running in
wide-character mode, and no translation is needed. On the
other hand, TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT may require translation.
If the translation is incomplete, they will insert Xs
defaultString whose value cannot be set, and may simply be
empty. Xterms defaultString resource specifies the string to
use for incomplete translations of the UTF8_STRING.</p>

<p>You can alter the types which xterm tries using the
eightBitSelectTypes or utf8SelectTypes resources. For
instance, you might have some spe- cific locale setting
which does not use UTF-8 encoding. The resource value is a
comma-separated list of the selection targets, which consist
of the names shown. You can use the special name I18N to
denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT. The
names are matched ignoring case, and can be abbreviated. The
default list can be expressed in several ways, e.g.,</p>

<p>UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING utf8,i18n,string u,i,s</p>

<p>MENUS Xterm has four menus, named mainMenu, vtMenu,
fontMenu, and tekMenu. Each menu pops up under the correct
combinations of key and button presses. Each menu is divided
into sections, separated by a horizontal line. Some menu
entries correspond to modes that can be altered. A check
mark appears next to a mode that is currently active.
Selecting one of these modes toggles its state. Other menu
entries are commands; selecting one of these performs the
indicated function.</p>

<p>All of the menu entries correspond to X actions. In the
list below, the menu label is shown followed by the action s
name in parenthesis.</p>

<p>Main Options The xterm mainMenu pops up when the control
key and pointer button one are pressed in a window. This
menu contains items that apply to both the VT102 and
Tektronix windows. There are several sections:</p>

<p>Commands for managing X events:</p>

<p>Toolbar Clicking on the &quot;Toolbar&quot; menu entry
hides the toolbar if it is visible, and shows it if it is
not.</p>

<p>Secure Keyboard (securekbd) The Secure Keyboard mode is
helpful when typing in pass- words or other sensitive data
in an unsecure environment; see SECURITY below (but read the
limitations carefully).</p>

<p>Allow SendEvents (allowsends) Specifies whether or not
synthetic key and button events generated using the X
protocol SendEvent request should be interpreted or
discarded. This corresponds to the allowSendEvents
resource.</p>

<p>Redraw Window (redraw) Forces the X display to repaint;
useful in some environ- ments.</p>

<p>Commands for capturing output:</p>

<p>Log to File (logging) Captures text sent to the screen
in a logfile, as in the -l logging option.</p>

<p>Print Window (print) Sends the text of the current
window to the program given in the printerCommand
resource.</p>

<p>Redirect to Printer (print-redir) This sets the
printerControlMode to 0 or 2. You can use this to turn the
printer on as if an application had sent the appropriate
control sequence. It is also useful for switching the
printer off if an application turns it on without resetting
the print control mode.</p>

<p>Modes for setting keyboard style:</p>

<p>8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control) Enabled for VT220
emulation, this controls whether xterm will send 8-bit
control sequences rather than using 7-bit (ASCII) controls,
e.g., sending a byte in the range 128-159 rather than the
escape character followed by a second byte. Xterm always
interprets both 8-bit and 7-bit control sequences (see the
document Xterm Control Sequences). This corresponds to the
eightBitControl resource.</p>

<p>Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow key) Modifies the
behavior of the backarrow key, making it transmit either a
backspace (8) or delete (127) charac- ter. This corresponds
to the backarrowKey resource.</p>

<p>Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock) Controls the treatment
of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers. This corresponds to the
numLock resource.</p>

<p>Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc) Controls whether Meta keys
are converted into a two-char- acter sequence with the
character itself preceded by ESC. This corresponds to the
metaSendsEscape resource.</p>

<p>Delete is DEL (delete-is-del) Controls whether the
Delete key on the editing keypad should send DEL (127) or
the VT220-style Remove escape sequence. This corresponds to
the deleteIsDEL resource.</p>

<p>Old Function-Keys (oldFunctionKeys)</p>

<p>HP Function-Keys (hpFunctionKeys)</p>

<p>SCO Function-Keys (scoFunctionKeys)</p>

<p>Sun Function-Keys (sunFunctionKeys)</p>

<p>VT220 Keyboard (sunKeyboard) These act as a
radio-button, selecting one style for the keyboard layout.
It corresponds to more than one resource setting:
sunKeyboard, sunFunctionKeys, scoFunc- tionKeys and
hpFunctionKeys .&quot;</p>

<p>Commands for process signalling:</p>

<p>Send STOP Signal (suspend)</p>

<p>Send CONT Signal (continue)</p>

<p>Send INT Signal (interrupt)</p>

<p>Send HUP Signal (hangup)</p>

<p>Send TERM Signal (terminate)</p>

<p>Send KILL Signal (kill) These send the SIGTSTP, SIGCONT,
SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals respectively, to
the process group of the process running under xterm
(usually the shell). The SIGCONT function is especially
useful if the user has accidentally typed CTRL-Z, suspending
the process.</p>

<p>Quit (quit) Stop processing X events except to support
the -hold option, and then send a SIGHUP signal to the the
process group of the process running under xterm (usually
the shell).</p>

<p>VT Options The vtMenu sets various modes in the VT102
emulation, and is popped up when the control key and pointer
button two are pressed in the VT102 window.</p>

<p>VT102/VT220 Modes:</p>

<p>Enable Scrollbar (scrollbar) Enable (or disable) the
scrollbar. This corresponds to the -sb option and the
scrollBar resource.</p>

<p>Enable Jump Scroll (jumpscroll) Enable (or disable) jump
scrolling. This corresponds to the -j option and the
jumpScroll resource.</p>

<p>Enable Reverse Video (reversevideo) Enable (or disable)
reverse-video. This corresponds to the -rv option and the
reverseVideo resource.</p>

<p>Enable Auto Wraparound (autowrap) Enable (or disable)
auto-wraparound. This corresponds to the -aw option and the
autoWrap resource.</p>

<p>Enable Reverse Wraparound (reversewrap) Enable (or
disable) reverse wraparound. This corresponds to the -rw
option and the reverseWrap resource.</p>

<p>Enable Auto Linefeed (autolinefeed) Enable (or disable)
auto-linefeed. This is the VT102 NEL function, which causes
the emulator to emit a linefeed after each carriage return.
There is no corresponding command-line option or resource
setting.</p>

<p>Enable Application Cursor Keys (appcursor) Enable (or
disable) application cursor keys. This corre- sponds to the
appcursorDefault resource. There is no corresponding
command-line option.</p>

<p>Enable Application Keypad (appkeypad) Enable (or
disable) application keypad keys. This corre- sponds to the
appkeypadDefault resource. There is no corresponding
command-line option.</p>

<p>Scroll to Bottom on Key Press (scrollkey) Enable (or
disable) scrolling to the bottom of the scrolling region on
a keypress. This corresponds to the -sk option and the
scrollKey resource.</p>

<p>Scroll to Bottom on Tty Output (scrollttyoutput) Enable
(or disable) scrolling to the bottom of the scrolling region
on output to the terminal. This corre- sponds to the -si
option and the scrollTtyOutput resource.</p>

<p>Allow 80/132 Column Switching (allow132) Enable (or
disable) switching between 80 and 132 columns. This
corresponds to the -132 option and the c132 resource.</p>

<p>Keep Selection (keepSelection) Tell xterm whether to
disown the selection when it stops highlighting it, e.g.,
when an application modifies the display so that it no
longer matches the text which has been highlighted. As long
as xterm continues to own the selection, it can provide the
corresponding text to other clients via cut/paste. This
corresponds to the keepSe- lection resource. There is no
corresponding command-line option.</p>

<p>Select to Clipboard (selectToClipboard) Tell xterm
whether to use the PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD for SELECT tokens in
the translations resource which maps keyboard and mouse
actions to select/paste actions. This corresponds to the
selectToClipboard resource. There is no corresponding
command-line option.</p>

<p>Enable Visual Bell (visualbell) Enable (or disable)
visible bell (i.e., flashing) instead of an audible bell.
This corresponds to the -vb option and the visualBell
resource.</p>

<p>Enable Bell Urgency (bellIsUrgent) Enable (or disable)
Urgency window manager hint when Con- trol-G is received.
This corresponds to the bellIsUrgent resource.</p>

<p>Enable Pop on Bell (poponbell) Enable (or disable)
raising of the window when Control-G is received. This
corresponds to the -pop option and the popOnBell
resource.</p>

<p>Enable Blinking Cursor (cursorblink) Enable (or disable)
the blinking-cursor feature. This corresponds to the -bc
option and the cursorBlink resource. There is also an escape
sequence (see the doc- ument Xterm Control Sequences). The
menu entry and the escape sequence states are XOR d: if both
are enabled, the cursor will not blink, if only one is
enabled, the cursor will blink.</p>

<p>Enable Alternate Screen Switching (titeInhibit) Enable
(or disable) switching between the normal and alternate
screens. This corresponds to the titeInhibit resource. There
is no corresponding command-line option.</p>

<p>Enable Active Icon (activeicon) Enable (or disable) the
active-icon feature. This corre- sponds to the -ai option
and the activeIcon resource.</p>

<p>VT102/VT220 Commands:</p>

<p>Do Soft Reset (softreset) Reset scroll regions. This can
be convenient when some program has left the scroll regions
set incorrectly (often a problem when using VMS or TOPS-20).
This corre- sponds to the VT220 DECSTR control sequence.</p>

<p>Do Full Reset (hardreset) The full reset entry will
clear the screen, reset tabs to every eight columns, and
reset the terminal modes (such as wrap and smooth scroll) to
their initial states just after xterm has finished
processing the command line options. This corresponds to the
VT102 RIS control sequence, with a few obvious differences.
For example, your session is not disconnected as a real
VT102 would do.</p>

<p>Reset and Clear Saved Lines (clearsavedlines) Perform a
full reset, and also clear the saved lines.</p>

<p>Commands for setting the current screen:</p>

<p>Show Tek Window (tekshow) When enabled, pops the
Tektronix 4014 window up (makes it visible). When disabled,
hides the Tektronix 4014 win- dow.</p>

<p>Switch to Tek Mode (tekmode) When enabled, pops the
Tektronix 4014 window up if it is not already visible, and
switches the input stream to that window. When disabled,
hides the Tektronix 4014 window and switches input back to
the VTxxx window.</p>

<p>Hide VT Window (vthide) When enabled, hides the VTxxx
window, shows the Tektronix 4014 window if it was not
already visible and switches the input stream to that
window. When disabled, shows the VTxxx window, and switches
the input stream to that window.</p>

<p>Show Alternate Screen (altscreen) When enabled, shows
the alternate screen. When disabled, shows the normal
screen. Note that the normal screen may have saved lines;
the alternate screen does not.</p>

<p>VT Fonts The fontMenu pops up when when the control key
and pointer button three are pressed in a window. It sets
the font used in the VT102 win- dow, or modifies the way the
font is specified or displayed. There are several
sections.</p>

<p>The first section allows you to select the font from a
set of alterna- tives:</p>

<p>Default (fontdefault) Set the font to the default, i.e.,
that given by the *VT100.font resource.</p>

<p>Unreadable (font1) Set the font to that given by the
*VT100.font1 resource.</p>

<p>Tiny (font2) Set the font to that given by the
*VT100.font2 resource.</p>

<p>Small (font3) Set the font to that given by the
*VT100.font3 resource.</p>

<p>Medium (font4) Set the font to that given by the
*VT100.font4 resource.</p>

<p>Large (font5) Set the font to that given by the
*VT100.font5 resource.</p>

<p>Huge (font6) Set the font to that given by the
*VT100.font6 resource.</p>

<p>Escape Sequence This allows you to set the font last
specified by the Set Font escape sequence (see the document
Xterm Control Sequences).</p>

<p>Selection (fontsel) This allows you to set the font
specified the current selection as a font name (if the
PRIMARY selection is owned).</p>

<p>The second section allows you to modify the way it is
displayed:</p>

<p>Line-Drawing Characters (font-linedrawing) When set,
tells xterm to draw its own line-drawing char- acters.
Otherwise it relies on the font containing these. Compare to
the forceBoxChars resource.</p>

<p>Packed Font (font-packed) When set, tells xterm to use
the minimum glyph-width from a font when displaying
characters. Use the maximum width (unchecked) to help
display proportional fonts. Compare to the forcePackedFont
resource.</p>

<p>Doublesized Characters (font-doublesize) When set, xterm
may ask the font server to produce scaled versions of the
normal font, for VT102 double-size char- acters.</p>

<p>The third section allows you to modify the way it is
specified:</p>

<p>TrueType Fonts (render-font) If the renderFont and
corresponding resources were set, this is a further control
whether xterm will actually use the Xft library calls to
obtain a font.</p>

<p>UTF-8 (utf8-mode) This controls whether xterm uses UTF-8
encoding of input/output. It is useful for temporarily
switching xterm to display text from an application which
does not follow the locale settings.</p>

<p>The fourth section allows you to enable or disable
special operations which can be controlled by writing escape
sequences to the terminal. These are disabled if the
SendEvents feature is enabled:</p>

<p>Allow Font Ops (allow-font-ops) This corresponds to the
allowFontOps resource. Enable or disable control sequences
that set/query the font.</p>

<p>Allow Tcap Ops (allow-tcap-ops) Enable or disable
control sequences that query the termi- nal s notion of its
function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo capabilities.
This corresponds to the allowT- capOps resource.</p>

<p>Allow Title Ops (allow-title-ops) Enable or disable
control sequences that modify the win- dow title or icon
name. This corresponds to the allowTi- tleOps resource.</p>

<p>Allow Window Ops (allow-window-ops) Enable or disable
extended window control sequences (as used in dtterm). This
corresponds to the allowWindowOps resource.</p>

<p>TEK Options The tekMenu sets various modes in the
Tektronix emulation, and is popped up when the control key
and pointer button two are pressed in the Tektronix window.
The current font size is checked in the modes section of the
menu.</p>

<p>Large Characters (tektextlarge)</p>

<p>#2 Size Characters (tektext2)</p>

<p>#3 Size Characters (tektext3)</p>

<p>Small Characters (tektextsmall)</p>

<p>Commands:</p>

<p>PAGE (tekpage) Clear the Tektronix window.</p>

<p>RESET (tekreset)</p>

<p>COPY (tekcopy)</p>

<p>Windows:</p>

<p>Show VT Window (vtshow)</p>

<p>Switch to VT Mode (vtmode)</p>

<p>Hide Tek Window (tekhide)</p>

<p>SECURITY X environments differ in their security
consciousness. Most servers, run under xdm, are capable of
using a magic cookie authorization scheme that can provide a
reasonable level of security for many people. If your server
is only using a host-based mechanism to control access to
the server (see xhost(1)), then if you enable access for a
host and other users are also permitted to run clients on
that same host, it is possible that someone can run an
application which uses the basic ser- vices of the X
protocol to snoop on your activities, potentially cap-
turing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.
Any pro- cess which has access to your X display can
manipulate it in ways that you might not anticipate, even
redirecting your keyboard to itself and sending events to
your applications windows. This is true even with the magic
cookie authorization scheme. While the allowSendEvents
provides some protection against rogue applications
tampering with your programs, guarding against a snooper is
harder.</p>

<p>The possibility of an application spying on your
keystrokes is of par- ticular concern when you want to type
in a password or other sensitive data. The best solution to
this problem is to use a better authoriza- tion mechanism
than is provided by X. Given all of these caveats, a simple
mechanism exists for protecting keyboard input in xterm.</p>

<p>The xterm menu (see MENUS above) contains a Secure
Keyboard entry which, when enabled, attempts to ensure that
all keyboard input is directed only to xterm (using the
GrabKeyboard protocol request). When an application prompts
you for a password (or other sensitive data), you can enable
Secure Keyboard using the menu, type in the data, and then
disable Secure Keyboard using the menu again. This ensures
that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes. It
cannot ensure that there are no processes which have access
to your X display that might be observing the keystrokes as
well.</p>

<p>Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so
when you attempt to enable Secure Keyboard it may fail. In
this case, the bell will sound. If the Secure Keyboard
succeeds, the foreground and background colors will be
exchanged (as if you selected the Reverse Video entry in the
Modes menu); they will be exchanged again when you exit
secure mode. If the colors do not switch, then you should be
very suspicious that you are being spoofed. If the
application you are running dis- plays a prompt before
asking for the password, it is safest to enter secure mode
before the prompt gets displayed, and to make sure that the
prompt gets displayed correctly (in the new colors), to
minimize the probability of spoofing. You can also bring up
the menu again and make sure that a check mark appears next
to the entry.</p>

<p>Secure Keyboard mode will be disabled automatically if
your xterm win- dow becomes iconified (or otherwise
unmapped), or if you start up a reparenting window manager
(that places a title bar or other decoration around the
window) while in Secure Keyboard mode. (This is a feature of
the X protocol not easily overcome.) When this happens, the
fore- ground and background colors will be switched back and
the bell will sound in warning.</p>

<p>CHARACTER CLASSES Clicking the left pointer button twice
in rapid succession (double- clicking) causes all characters
of the same class (e.g., letters, white space, punctuation)
to be selected as a word . Since different people have
different preferences for what should be selected (for
example, should filenames be selected as a whole or only the
separate subnames), the default mapping can be overridden
through the use of the charClass (class CharClass)
resource.</p>

<p>This resource is a series of comma-separated of
range:value pairs. The range is either a single number or
low-high in the range of 0 to 65535, corresponding to the
code for the character or characters to be set. The value is
arbitrary, although the default table uses the character
number of the first character occurring in the set. When not
in UTF-8 mode, only the first 256 bytes of this table will
be used.</p>

<p>The default table starts as follows -</p>

<p>static int charClass[256] = { / NUL SOH STX ETX EOT ENQ

<p>For example, the string 33:48,37:48,45-47:48,38:48
indicates that the exclamation mark, percent sign, dash,
period, slash, and ampersand characters should be treated
the same way as characters and numbers. This is useful for
cutting and pasting electronic mailing addresses and
filenames.</p>

<p>ACTIONS It is possible to rebind keys (or sequences of
keys) to arbitrary strings for input, by changing the
translations resources for the vt100 or tek4014 widgets.
Changing the translations resource for events other than key
and button events is not expected, and will cause unpre-
dictable behavior. The following actions are provided for
use within the vt100 or tek4014 translations resources:</p>

<p>allow-font-ops(on/off/toggle) This action set or toggles
the allowFontOps resource and is also invoked by the
allow-font-ops entry in fontMenu.</p>

<p>allow-send-events(on/off/toggle) This action set or
toggles the allowSendEvents resource and is also invoked by
the allowsends entry in mainMenu.</p>

<p>allow-tcap-ops(on/off/toggle) This action set or toggles
the allowTcapOps resource and is also invoked by the
allow-tcap-ops entry in fontMenu.</p>

<p>allow-title-ops(on/off/toggle) This action set or
toggles the allowTitleOps resource and is also invoked by
the allow-title-ops entry in fontMenu.</p>

<p>allow-window-ops(on/off/toggle) This action set or
toggles the allowWindowOps resource and is also invoked by
the allow-window-ops entry in fontMenu.</p>

<p>alt-sends-escape() This action toggles the state of the
eightBitInput resource.</p>

<p>bell([percent]) This action rings the keyboard bell at
the specified percentage above or below the base volume.</p>

<p>clear-saved-lines() This action does hard-reset() (see
below) and also clears the history of lines saved off the
top of the screen. It is also invoked from the
clearsavedlines entry in vtMenu. The effect is identical to
a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.</p>

<p>create-menu(m/v/f/t) This action creates one of the
menus used by xterm, if it has not been previously created.
The parameter values are the menu names: mainMenu, vtMenu,
fontMenu, tekMenu, respectively.</p>

<p>dabbrev-expand() Expands the word before cursor by
searching in the preceding text on the screen and in the
scrollback buffer for words starting with that abbreviation.
Repeating dabbrev-expand() several times in sequence
searches for an alternative expansion by looking farther
back. Lack of more matches is signaled by a beep(). Attempts
to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor is preceded by a
space) yield successively all previous words. Consecutive
identical expansions are ignored. The word here is defined
as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. This fea- ture
partially emulates the behavior of dynamic abbreviation
expansion in Emacs (bound there to M-/). Here is a resource
setting for xterm which will do the same thing:</p>

<p>*VT100*translations: #override Meta &lt;KeyPress&gt;
/:dabbrev-expand()</p>

<p>deiconify() Changes the window state back to normal, if
it was iconified.</p>

<p>delete-is-del() This action toggles the state of the
deleteIsDEL resource.</p>

<p>dired-button() Handles a button event (other than press
and release) by echo- ing the event s position (i.e.,
character line and column) in the following format:</p>

<p>^X ESC G &lt;line+ &gt; &lt;col+ &gt;</p>

<p>iconify() Iconifies the window.</p>

<p>hard-reset() This action resets the scrolling region,
tabs, window size, and cursor keys and clears the screen. It
is also invoked from the hardreset entry in vtMenu.</p>

<p>ignore() This action ignores the event but checks for
special pointer position escape sequences.</p>

<p>insert() This action inserts the character or string
associated with the key that was pressed.</p>

<p>insert-eight-bit() This action inserts an eight-bit
(Meta) version of the charac- ter or string associated with
the key that was pressed. This only applies to single-byte
values. The exact action depends on the value of the
metaSendsEscape and the eightBitInput resources. The
metaSendsEscape resource is tested first.</p>

<p>The term &quot;eight-bit&quot; is misleading: xterm
checks if the keys value is less than 128. If so, xterm adds
128 to the value, setting its eighth bit. Otherwise xterm
sends an ESC byte before the key. In other applications
documentation, that is referred to as a &quot;meta
key&quot;.</p>

<p>insert-selection(sourcename [, ...]) This action inserts
the string found in the selection or cut- buffer indicated
by sourcename. Sources are checked in the order given (case
is significant) until one is found. Com- monly-used
selections include: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, and CLIP- BOARD. Cut
buffers are typically named CUT_BUFFER0 through
CUT_BUFFER7.</p>

<p>insert-seven-bit() This action is a synonym for insert()
The term &quot;seven-bit&quot; is misleading: it only
implies that xterm does not try to add 128 to the keys value
as in insert-eight-bit().</p>

<p>interpret(control-sequence) Interpret the given control
sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to the host. This
works by inserting the control sequence at the front of the
input buffer. Use &quot; octal digits in the string. Xt does
not allow you to put a null character (i.e., &quot;
00&quot;) in the string.</p>

<p>keymap(name) This action dynamically defines a new
translation table whose resource name is name with the
suffix Keymap (case is signifi- cant). The name None
restores the original translation table.</p>

<p>larger-vt-font() Set the font to the next larger one,
based on the font dimen- sions. See also set-vt-font().</p>

<p>load-vt-fonts(name[,class]) Load fontnames from the
given subresource name and class. That is, load the
&quot;*VT100.name.font&quot;, resource as
&quot;*VT100.font&quot; etc. If no name is given, the
original set of fontnames is restored.</p>

<p>Unlike set-vt-font(), this does not affect the escape-
and select-fonts, since those are not based on resource
values. It does affect the fonts loosely organized under the
Default menu entry: font, boldFont, wideFont and
wideBoldFont.</p>

<p>maximize() Resizes the window to fill the screen.</p>

<p>meta-sends-escape() This action toggles the state of the
metaSendsEscape resource.</p>

<p>popup-menu(menuname) This action displays the specified
popup menu. Valid names (case is significant) include:
mainMenu, vtMenu, fontMenu, and tekMenu.</p>

<p>print(printer-flags) This action prints the window and
is also invoked by the print entry in mainMenu.</p>

<p>The action accepts optional parameters, which
temporarily over- ride resource settings. The parameter
values are matched ignoring case:</p>

<p>noFormFeed no form feed will be sent at the end of the
last line printed (i.e., printerFormFeed is false).</p>

<p>FormFeed a form feed will be sent at the end of the last
line printed (i.e., printerFormFeed is true).</p>

<p>noNewLine no newline will be sent at the end of the last
line printed, and wrapped lines will be combined into long
lines (i.e., printerNewLine is false).</p>

<p>NewLine a newline will be sent at the end of the last
line printed, and each line will be limited (by adding a
new- line) to the screen width (i.e., printerNewLine is
true).</p>

<p>noAttrs the page is printed without attributes (i.e.,
printAt- tributes is 0).</p>

<p>monoAttrs the page is printed with monochrome (vt220)
attributes (i.e., printAttributes is 1).</p>

<p>colorAttrs the page is printed with ANSI color
attributes (i.e., printAttributes is 2).</p>

<p>print-everything(printer-flags) This action sends the
entire text history, in addition to the text currently
visible, to the program given in the printerCom- mand
resource. It allows the same optional parameters as the
print action. With a suitable printer command, the action
can be used to load the text history in an editor.</p>

<p>print-redir() This action toggles the printerControlMode
between 0 and 2. The corresponding popup menu entry is
useful for switching the printer off if you happen to change
your mind after deciding to print random binary files on the
terminal.</p>

<p>quit() This action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and
exits. It is also invoked by the quit entry in mainMenu.</p>

<p>redraw() This action redraws the window and is also
invoked by the redraw entry in mainMenu.</p>

<p>restore() Restores the window to the size before it was
last maximized.</p>

<p>scroll-back(count [,units [,mouse] ]) This action
scrolls the text window backward so that text that had
previously scrolled off the top of the screen is now visi-
ble.</p>

<p>The count argument indicates the number of units (which
may be page, halfpage, pixel, or line) by which to
scroll.</p>

<p>An adjustment can be specified for these values by
appending a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; sign followed by
a number, e.g., page-2 to specify 2 lines less than a
page.</p>

<p>If the third parameter mouse is given, the action is
ignored when mouse reporting is enabled.</p>

<p>scroll-forw(count [,units [,mouse] ]) This action is
similar to scroll-back except that it scrolls in the other
direction.</p>

<p>secure() This action toggles the Secure Keyboard mode
described in the section named SECURITY, and is invoked from
the securekbd entry in mainMenu.</p>

<p>select-cursor-end(destname [, ...]) This action is
similar to select-end except that it should be used with
select-cursor-start.</p>

<p>select-cursor-extend() This action is similar to
select-extend except that it should be used with
select-cursor-start.</p>

<p>select-cursor-start() This action is similar to
select-start except that it begins the selection at the
current text cursor position.</p>

<p>select-end(destname [, ...]) This action puts the
currently selected text into all of the selections or
cutbuffers specified by destname.</p>

<p>select-extend() This action tracks the pointer and
extends the selection. It should only be bound to Motion
events.</p>

<p>select-set() This action stores text that corresponds to
the current selec- tion, without affecting the selection
mode.</p>

<p>select-start() This action begins text selection at the
current pointer loca- tion. See the section on POINTER USAGE
for information on mak- ing selections.</p>

<p>send-signal(signame) This action sends the signal named
by signame to the xterm sub- process (the shell or program
specified with the -e command line option) and is also
invoked by the suspend, continue, interrupt, hangup,
terminate, and kill entries in mainMenu. Allowable signal
names are (case is not significant): tstp (if supported by
the operating system), suspend (same as tstp), cont (if
supported by the operating system), int, hup, term, quit,
alrm, alarm (same as alrm) and kill.</p>

process which is running in the current xterm.</p>

<p>On systems which have the &quot;exe&quot; process entry,
e.g., /proc/12345/exe, use this to obtain the actual
executable. Otherwise, use the $PATH variable to find
xterm.</p>

<p>If parameters are given in the action, pass them to the
new xterm process.</p>

<p>start-extend() This action is similar to select-start
except that the selec- tion is extended to the current
pointer location.</p>

<p>start-cursor-extend() This action is similar to
select-extend except that the selec- tion is extended to the

the string contains whites- pace or non-alphanumeric
characters. If the string argument begins with the
characters 0x, it is interpreted as a hex character
constant.</p>

event s line number in the screen relative to the current
line:</p>

<p>ESC ^P or ESC ^N</p>

<p>according to whether the event is before, or after the
current line, respectively. The ^N (or ^P) is repeated once
for each line that the event differs from the current line.
The control sequence is omitted altogether if the button
event is on the current line.</p>

<p>visual-bell() This action flashes the window
quickly.</p>

<p>The Tektronix window also has the following action:</p>

<p>gin-press(l/L/m/M/r/R) This action sends the indicated
graphics input code.</p>

<p>The default bindings in the VT102 window use the SELECT

<p>Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to
copy to the clip- board, and unshifted select/paste for the
primary selection. In each case, a (different) cut buffer is
also a target or source of the select/paste operation. It is
important to remember however, that cut buffers store data
in ISO-8859-1 encoding, while selections can store data in a
variety of formats and encodings. While xterm owns the
selection, it highlights it. When it loses the selection, it
removes the corresponding highlight. But you can still paste
from the corre- sponding cut buffer.</p>

<p>*VT100*translations: #override
~Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: insert-selection(PRIMARY,
CUT_BUFFER0) Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;:
insert-selection(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)
~Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;: select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)
Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;: select-end(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)</p>

<p>Below is a sample how of the keymap() action is used to
add special keys for entering commonly-typed works:</p>

<p>*VT100.Translations: #override &lt;Key&gt;F13:

<p>Some people prefer using the left pointer button for
dragging the scrollbar thumb. That can be setup by altering
the translations resource, e.g.,</p>

<p>*VT100.scrollbar.translations:#override
&lt;Btn5Down&gt;:StartScroll(Forward)
&lt;Btn1Down&gt;:StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb()
NotifyThumb() &lt;Btn4Down&gt;:StartScroll(Backward)
&lt;Btn1Motion&gt;:MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() &lt;BtnUp&gt;:
NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()</p>

<p>CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD The Xterm Control
Sequences document lists the control sequences which an
application can send xterm to make it perform various
operations. Most of these operations are standardized, from
either the DEC or Tek- tronix terminals, or from more widely
used standards such as ISO-6429.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Xterm sets several environment
variables:</p>

<p>DISPLAY is the display name, pointing to the X server
(see DISPLAY NAMES in X(7)).</p>

<p>TERM is set according to the termcap (or terminfo) entry
which it is using as a reference.</p>

<p>WINDOWID is set to the X window id number of the xterm
window.</p>

<p>XTERM_LOCALE shows the locale which was used by xterm on
startup. Some shell initialization scripts may set a
different locale.</p>

<p>XTERM_SHELL is set to the pathname of the program which
is invoked. Usually that is a shell program, e.g., /bin/sh.
Since it is not necessar- ily a shell program however, it is
distinct from SHELL.</p>

<p>XTERM_VERSION is set to the string displayed by the
-version option. That is normally an identifier for the X
Window libraries used to build xterm, followed by xterm s
patch number in parenthesis. The patch number is also part
of the response to a Secondary Device Attributes (DA)
control sequence (see Xterm Control Sequences).</p>

<p>Depending on your system configuration, xterm may also
set the follow- ing:</p>

<p>COLUMNS the width of the xterm in characters (cf:
&quot;stty columns&quot;).</p>

<p>HOME when xterm is configured to update utmp.</p>

<p>LINES the height of the xterm in characters (cf:
&quot;stty rows&quot;).</p>

<p>LOGNAME when xterm is configured to update utmp.</p>

<p>SHELL when xterm is configured to update utmp. It is
also set if you provide the shell name as the optional
parameter.</p>

<p>TERMCAP the contents of the termcap entry corresponding
to $TERM, with lines and columns values substituted for the
actual size window you have created.</p>

<p>TERMINFO may be defined to a nonstandard location in the
configure script.</p>

<p>FILES The actual pathnames given may differ on your
system.</p>

<p>/var/run/utmp the system logfile, which records user
logins.</p>

<p>/var/log/wtmp the system logfile, which records user
logins and logouts.</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XTerm the xterm default
application resources.</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color the xterm color
application resources. If your display supports color, use
this *customization: -color in your .Xdefaults file to
automatically use this resource file rather than
/usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XTerm. If you do not do this,
xterm uses its compiled-in default resource settings for
colors.</p>

<p>ERROR MESSAGES Most of the fatal error messages from
xterm use the following format: xterm: Error XXX, errno YYY:
ZZZ The XXX codes (which are used by xterm as its exit-code)
are listed below, with a brief explanation.</p>

<p>BUGS Large pastes do not work on some systems. This is
not a bug in xterm; it is a bug in the pseudo terminal
driver of those systems. xterm feeds large pastes to the pty
only as fast as the pty will accept data, but some pty
drivers do not return enough information to know if the
write has succeeded.</p>

<p>Many of the options are not resettable after xterm
starts.</p>

<p>This program still needs to be rewritten. It should be
split into very modular sections, with the various emulators
being completely separate widgets that do not know about
each other. Ideally, you d like to be able to pick and
choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single control
widget.</p>

<p>There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek
COPY file name.</p>
