<p>NAME pmdapapi - papi performance metrics domain agent
(PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pmdapapi [-d domain] [-l
logfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdapapi is a papi Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which exposes hardware performance
counters via the library Performance API (PAPI).</p>

<p>The metrics exported by the papi PMDA report values
gathered from the hardware counters and metrics available,
as reported by papi. Cur- rently, only root users may access
such metrics.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdapapi command line options
follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named papi.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdapapi is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If
the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable, output
is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>Performance counters are activated automatically as they
are fetched cyclically (such as via pmval(1) or
pmlogger(1)). This automatic acti- vation is temporary, and
lasts only a number of seconds governed by the
papi.control.auto_enable control value (default 120). In the
case automatic activation is undesirable, one may disable it
by setting the papi.control.auto_enable metric to 0.</p>

<p>Alternately, the pmstore(1) command can be used to
permanently enable tracking particular metrics, or stop them
on demand. Using the papi.control.enable and
papi.control.disable metrics, one may set the metrics you
wish to track using a space or comma seperated list. Writ-
ing to the papi.control.reset metric disables all counters
immediately. This may be useful if the system performance
counters are needed for another profiling task.</p>

<p># pmstore papi.control.enable &quot;TOT_CYC
TOT_INS&quot; papi.control.enable old value=&quot;&quot; new
value=&quot;TOT_CYC TOT_INS&quot;</p>

<p># pmval papi.system.TOT_CYC 8.371E+04 # pmval
papi.system.TOT_INS 2.712E+04 # pmstore papi.control.disable
&quot;TOT_CYC,TOT_INS&quot; papi.control.disable old
value=&quot;&quot; new value=&quot;TOT_CYC,TOT_INS&quot;</p>

<p>Fetching the papi.control.status metric provides an
overview of all active counters.</p>

<p>By default, PAPI multiplexing, which allows support for
collecting more metrics than supported by the hardware
concurrently, is enabled. One may modify the
papi.control.multiplex metric to disable multiplexing by
setting it to 0.</p>

<p>Where possible, pmdapapi will expose available native
perf and uncore events on the current hardware. It is not
possible to count some native metrics and preset metrics
concurrently.</p>

<p># true -- automatically-enabled counters # pmval -s3
papi.system.perf.BRANCH.LOADS metric:
papi.system.perf.BRANCH.LOADS host: HOSTNAME semantics:
cumulative counter (converting to rate) units: count
(converting to count / sec) samples: 3 interval: 1.00 sec
7530. 7539. 7543.</p>

<p># pmval -s3 papi.system.perf.BRANCH.MISSES metric:
papi.system.perf.BRANCH.MISSES host: HOSTNAME semantics:
cumulative counter (converting to rate) units: count
(converting to count / sec) samples: 3 interval: 1.00 sec
696.8 590.8 651.8</p>

<p># true -- quick overview # pminfo -f papi.control.status
papi.control.status value &quot;Papi is running, has
multiplexing enabled, perf.BRANCH.MISSES(114): 8960,
perf.BRANCH.LOADS(110): 158400&quot;</p>

<p># true -- optional instant disable # pmstore
papi.control.disable
&quot;perf.BRANCH.LOADS,perf.BRANCH.MISSES&quot;
papi.control.disable old value=&quot;&quot; new
value=&quot;perf.BRANCH.LOADS,perf.BRANCH.MISSES&quot;</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the papi per- formance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/papi # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation (and remove both
PMDAs), do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/papi # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdapapi is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdapapi $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/papi/help default help text
file for the papi metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/papi/Install
installation script for the pmdapapi agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/papi/Remove undo installation script for the
pmdapapi agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/sample.log default log file
for error messages and other information from pmdapapi</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
