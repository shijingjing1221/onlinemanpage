<p>NAME dirent.h - format of directory entries</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The internal format of directories is
unspecified.</p>

<p>The &lt;dirent.h&gt; header shall define the following
type:</p>

<p>DIR A type representing a directory stream.</p>

<p>It shall also define the structure dirent which shall
include the fol- lowing members:</p>

<p>ino_t d_ino File serial number.</p>

<p>char d_name[] Name of entry.</p>

<p>The type ino_t shall be defined as described in
&lt;sys/types.h&gt; .</p>

<p>The character array d_name is of unspecified size, but
the number of bytes preceding the terminating null byte
shall not exceed {NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>int closedir(DIR *); DIR *opendir(const char *); struct
dirent *readdir(DIR *);</p>

<p>int readdir_r(DIR *restrict, struct dirent *restrict,
struct dirent **restrict);</p>

<p>void rewinddir(DIR *);</p>

<p>void seekdir(DIR *, long); long telldir(DIR *);</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Information similar to that in the
&lt;dirent.h&gt; header is contained in a file
&lt;sys/dir.h&gt; in 4.2 BSD and 4.3 BSD. The equivalent in
these imple- mentations of struct dirent from this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is struct direct. The filename was
changed because the name &lt;sys/dir.h&gt; was also used in
earlier implementations to refer to definitions related to
the older access method; this produced name conflicts. The
name of the structure was changed because this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not completely define what is in
the struc- ture, so it could be different on some
implementations from struct direct.</p>

<p>The name of an array of char of an unspecified size
should not be used as an lvalue. Use of:</p>

<p>sizeof(d_name)</p>

<p>is incorrect; use:</p>

<p>strlen(d_name)</p>

<p>instead.</p>

<p>The array of char d_name is not a fixed size.
Implementations may need to declare struct dirent with an
array size for d_name of 1, but the actual number of
characters provided matches (or only slightly exceeds) the
length of the filename.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
