<p>NAME abrt.conf - Configuration file for abrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION abrt is a daemon that watches for
application crashes. When a crash occurs, it collects the
problem data and takes action according to its
configuration. This document describes abrts configuration
file.</p>

<p>The configuration file consists of items in the format
&quot;Option = Value&quot;. A description of each item
follows:</p>

<p>DumpLocation = directory The directory where should abrt
store coredumps and all files which are needed for
reporting. The default is /var/spool/abrt.</p>

<p>MaxCrashReportsSize = number The maximum disk space
(specified in megabytes) that abrt will use for all the
crash dumps. Specify a value here to ensure that the crash
dumps will not fill all available storage space. The default
is 1000.</p>

<p>WatchCrashdumpArchiveDir = directory The daemon will
watch this directory and call abrt-handle-upload on files
which appear there. This is used to auto-unpack crashdump
tarballs uploaded via ftp, scp, etc. The directory must
exist and be writable for abrt. There is no default.</p>

<p>DeleteUploaded = yes/no The daemon will delete an
uploaded crashdump archive after an atempt to unpack it. An
archive will be delete whether unpacking finishes
successfully or not. The default value is no.</p>
