<p>PERFEVENT.CONF(5) PERFEVENT.CONF(5)</p>

<p>NAME perfevent.conf - the Performance Co-Pilot perfevent
PMDA configuration file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIRS/perfevent/perfevent.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The perfevent.conf configuration file
defines which hardware perfor- mance counters are enabled by
the perfevent PMDA.</p>

<p>The configuration file contains a list of events that
should be enabled for each PMU. The perfevent PMDA detects
which PMUs present and pro- grams the configured events. If
multiple PMUs are available, the per- fevent PMDA uses the
order of the entries in the configuration file to determine
which PMU settings to use. The entries at the top of the
con- figuration file have higher precidence. Only one PMU
configuration setting is used.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT The file consists of one or more groups of
PMUs and the events that go with them.</p>

<p>The PMU identification string is enclosed in brackets
and one or more events are listed below, one per line.</p>

<p>[&quot;PMU identification string&quot;] EVENT_NAME [CPU
OPTION] ...</p>

<p>The available event cpu options are as follows:</p>

<p>cpu to add the counter to all cpus in the system</p>

<p>cpu_rr to add to one of the cpus in a round-robin
allocation strategy</p>

<p>node to add the counter to the first cpu in each numa
node</p>

<p>node_rr to add the counter to the cpus in each numa node
in a round- robin allocation strategy</p>

<p>[N] where N is the numerical digit of the CPU index</p>

<p>if the CPU option is absent then the event is programmed
on all cpus.</p>

<p>Blank lines are ignored. Lines that begin with the #
sign are ignored.</p>

<p>Multiple, comma separated, PMUs may be specifed in the
PMU definition.</p>
