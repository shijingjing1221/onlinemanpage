<p>PTHREAD_EQUAL(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_EQUAL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_equal - compare thread IDs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_equal(pthread_t t1, pthread_t t2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function shall compare the thread IDs
t1 and t2.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The pthread_equal() function shall return a
non-zero value if t1 and t2 are equal; otherwise, zero shall
be returned.</p>

<p>If either t1 or t2 are not valid thread IDs, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The pthread_equal() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Implementations may choose to define a thread
ID as a structure. This allows additional flexibility and
robustness over using an int. For example, a thread ID could
include a sequence number that allows detec- tion of
&quot;dangling IDs&quot; (copies of a thread ID that has
been detached). Since the C language does not support
comparison on structure types, the pthread_equal() function
is provided to compare thread IDs.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
