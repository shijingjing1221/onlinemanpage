<p>X25(7) Linux Programmer s Manual X25(7)</p>

<p>NAME x25, AF_X25 - ITU-T X.25 / ISO-8208 protocol
interface.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include
&lt;linux/x25.h&gt;</p>

<p>x25_socket = socket(AF_X25, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION X25 sockets provide an interface to the X.25
packet layer protocol. This allows applications to
communicate over a public X.25 data network as standardized
by International Telecommunication Unions recommenda- tion
X.25 (X.25 DTE-DCE mode). X25 sockets can also be used for
commu- nication without an intermediate X.25 network (X.25
DTE-DTE mode) as described in ISO-8208.</p>

<p>Message boundaries are preserved a read(2) from a socket
will retrieve the same chunk of data as output with the
corresponding write(2) to the peer socket. When necessary,
the kernel takes care of segmenting and re-assembling long
messages by means of the X.25 M-bit. There is no hard-coded
upper limit for the message size. However, re- assembling of
a long message might fail if there is a temporary lack of
system resources or when other constraints (such as socket
memory or buffer size limits) become effective. If that
occurs, the X.25 connec- tion will be reset.</p>

<p>Socket Addresses The AF_X25 socket address family uses
the struct sockaddr_x25 for rep- resenting network addresses
as defined in ITU-T recommendation X.121.</p>

<p>struct sockaddr_x25 { sa_family_t sx25_family; /* must
be AF_X25 */ x25_address sx25_addr; /* X.121 Address */
};</p>

<p>sx25_addr contains a char array x25_addr[] to be
interpreted as a null- terminated string.
sx25_addr.x25_addr[] consists of up to 15 (not counting the
terminating 0) ASCII characters forming the X.121 address.
Only the decimal digit characters from &rsquo;0&rsquo; to
&rsquo;9&rsquo; are allowed.</p>

<p>Socket Options The following X.25-specific socket
options can be set by using setsock- opt(2) and read with
getsockopt(2) with the level argument set to SOL_X25.</p>

<p>X25_QBITINCL Controls whether the X.25 Q-bit (Qualified
Data Bit) is accessi- ble by the user. It expects an integer
argument. If set to 0 (default), the Q-bit is never set for
outgoing packets and the Q-bit of incoming packets is
ignored. If set to 1, an addi- tional first byte is
prepended to each message read from or written to the
socket. For data read from the socket, a 0 first byte
indicates that the Q-bits of the corresponding incoming data
packets were not set. A first byte with value 1 indicates
that the Q-bit of the corresponding incoming data packets
was set. If the first byte of the data written to the socket
is 1 the Q-bit of the corresponding outgoing data packets
will be set. If the first byte is 0 the Q-bit will not be
set.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The AF_X25 protocol family is a new feature of
Linux 2.2.</p>

<p>BUGS Plenty, as the X.25 PLP implementation is
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.</p>

<p>This man page is incomplete.</p>

<p>There is no dedicated application programmers header
file yet; you need to include the kernel header file
&lt;linux/x25.h&gt;. CONFIG_EXPERI- MENTAL might also imply
that future versions of the interface are not binary
compatible.</p>

<p>X.25 N-Reset events are not propagated to the user
process yet. Thus, if a reset occurred, data might be lost
without notice.</p>
