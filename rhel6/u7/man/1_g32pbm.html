<p>NAME g32pbm - convert a Group 3 fax file into a portable
bitmap</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS g32pbm [-reversebits] [-stretch] [g3file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Reads a Group 3 fax file (raw or digifax) as
input. If no filename is given, stdin is used. Produces a
portable bitmap as output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -r Tells g32pbm to interpret bits
least-significant first, instead of the default
most-significant first (&quot;-reversebits&quot;). Some fax
modems do it one way and others do it the other way. If you
get a whole bunch of &quot;invalid code&quot; messages
(nearly one per line), try using this flag.</p>

<p>-s Double each horizontal row of the fax file in the pbm
file (&quot;-stretch)&quot;. You can use this to adjust the
aspect ratio of a &quot;normal resolution&quot; fax file to
match that of a &quot;fine resolu- tion&quot; fax file. This
might not seem like it belongs here, but it s much faster
than using pnmscale|pgmtopbm later. -s is activated
automatically if the file is specified on the command line
and its name starts with &quot;fn...&quot; (fax/normal).</p>

<p>-l(aserjet) Instead of a portable bitmap (PBM), output
HP laserjet files, suitable for direct printing on a HP
laserjet or desjket.</p>

<p>-d &lt;dpi&gt; Scale output to &lt;dpi&gt; dots per inch
before printing. Normal FAX resolution is 204x196 dpi (fine
mode), or 204x98 dpi (normal mode). In LaerJet mode, only
the values 75, 150 and 300 are allowed for &lt;dpi&gt;.</p>

<p>-t turn image by 90 degrees clockwise. Multiple -t
commands increase angle, that is, -t -t will turn it upside
down, and so on.</p>

<p>-? Print a short command syntax.</p>

<p>REFERENCES The standard for Group 3 fax is defined in
CCITT Recommendation T.4.</p>

<p>BUGS g32pbm could be smarter about the image width, at
the moment, the maxi- mum width is 1728 pixels, and the
maximum height is 4300 lines. Every- thing bigger is just
cut off.</p>

<p>Only raw pbm files are created.</p>

<p>Scaling is too slow.</p>

<p>Turning is too slow (and not yet fully implemented
either).</p>
