<p>ENDHOSTENT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
ENDHOSTENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME endhostent, gethostent, sethostent - network host
database functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>void endhostent(void); struct hostent *gethostent(void);
void sethostent(int stayopen);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall retrieve information
about hosts. This informa- tion is considered to be stored
in a database that can be accessed sequentially or randomly.
The implementation of this database is unspecified.</p>

<p>Note: In many cases this database is implemented by the
Domain Name System, as documented in RFC 1034, RFC 1035, and
RFC 1886.</p>

<p>The sethostent() function shall open a connection to the
database and set the next entry for retrieval to the first
entry in the database. If the stayopen argument is non-zero,
the connection shall not be closed by a call to
gethostent(), gethostbyname(), or gethostbyaddr(), and the
implementation may maintain an open file descriptor.</p>

<p>The gethostent() function shall read the next entry in
the database, opening and closing a connection to the
database as necessary.</p>

<p>Entries shall be returned in hostent structures. Refer
to gethost- byaddr() for a definition of the hostent
structure.</p>

<p>The endhostent() function shall close the connection to
the database, releasing any open file descriptor.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
gethostent() function shall return a pointer to a hostent
structure if the requested entry was found, and a null
pointer if the end of the database was reached or the
requested entry was not found.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined for endhostent(),
gethostent(), and sethostent().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The gethostent() function may return
pointers to static data, which may be overwritten by
subsequent calls to any of these functions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
