<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CollapseMotionEvents, Tk_QueueWindowEvent - Add
a window event to the Tcl event queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tk_CollapseMotionEvents(display, collapse)</p>

<p>Tk_QueueWindowEvent(eventPtr, position)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Display *display (in) Display for which to
control motion event collapsing.</p>

<p>int collapse (in) Indicates whether motion events should
be collapsed or not.</p>

<p>XEvent *eventPtr (in) An event to add to the event
queue.</p>

<p>Tcl_QueuePosition position (in) Where to add the new
event in the queue: TCL_QUEUE_TAIL, TCL_QUEUE_HEAD, or
TCL_QUEUE_MARK.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_QueueWindowEvent places a window event on
Tcls internal event queue for eventual servicing. It creates
a Tcl_Event structure, copies the event into that structure,
and calls Tcl_QueueEvent to add the event to the queue. When
the event is eventually removed from the queue it is
processed just like all window events.</p>

<p>When multiple motion events are received for the same
window in rapid succession, they are collapsed by default.
This behavior can be con- trolled with
Tk_CollapseMotionEvents. Tk_CollapseMotionEvents always
returns the previous value for collapse behavior on the
display.</p>

<p>The position argument to Tk_QueueWindowEvent has the
same significance as for Tcl_QueueEvent; see the
documentation for Tcl_QueueEvent for details.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS callback, clock, handler, modal timeout,
events</p>
