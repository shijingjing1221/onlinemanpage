<p>SHMGET(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SHMGET(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME shmget - get an XSI shared memory segment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</p>

<p>int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The shmget() function operates on XSI shared
memory (see the Base Defi- nitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.340, Shared Memory Object). It is
unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in
Realtime .</p>

<p>The shmget() function shall return the shared memory
identifier associ- ated with key.</p>

<p>A shared memory identifier, associated data structure,
and shared mem- ory segment of at least size bytes (see
&lt;sys/shm.h&gt;) are created for key if one of the
following is true:</p>

<p>* The argument key is equal to IPC_PRIVATE.</p>

<p>* The argument key does not already have a shared memory
identifier associated with it and (shmflg &amp;IPC_CREAT) is
non-zero.</p>

<p>Upon creation, the data structure associated with the
new shared memory identifier shall be initialized as
follows:</p>

<p>* The values of shm_perm.cuid, shm_perm.uid,
shm_perm.cgid, and shm_perm.gid are set equal to the
effective user ID and effective group ID, respectively, of
the calling process.</p>

<p>* The low-order nine bits of shm_perm.mode are set equal
to the low- order nine bits of shmflg.</p>

<p>* The value of shm_segsz is set equal to the value of
size.</p>

<p>* The values of shm_lpid, shm_nattch, shm_atime, and
shm_dtime are set equal to 0.</p>

<p>* The value of shm_ctime is set equal to the current
time.</p>

<p>When the shared memory segment is created, it shall be
initialized with all zero values.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, shmget() shall
return a non-negative inte- ger, namely a shared memory
identifier; otherwise, it shall return -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The shmget() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES A shared memory identifier exists for key but
operation permis- sion as specified by the low-order nine
bits of shmflg would not be granted; see XSI Interprocess
Communication .</p>

<p>EEXIST A shared memory identifier exists for the
argument key but (shm- flg &amp;IPC_CREAT) &amp;&amp;(shmflg
&amp;IPC_EXCL) is non-zero.</p>

<p>EINVAL A shared memory segment is to be created and the
value of size is less than the system-imposed minimum or
greater than the sys- tem-imposed maximum.</p>

<p>EINVAL No shared memory segment is to be created and a
shared memory segment exists for key but the size of the
segment associated with it is less than size and size is not
0.</p>

<p>ENOENT A shared memory identifier does not exist for the
argument key and (shmflg &amp;IPC_CREAT) is 0.</p>

<p>ENOMEM A shared memory identifier and associated shared
memory segment shall be created, but the amount of available
physical memory is not sufficient to fill the request.</p>

<p>ENOSPC A shared memory identifier is to be created, but
the system- imposed limit on the maximum number of allowed
shared memory identifiers system-wide would be exceeded.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The POSIX Realtime Extension defines
alternative interfaces for inter- process communication.
Application developers who need to use IPC should design
their applications so that modules using the IPC routines
described in XSI Interprocess Communication can be easily
modified to use the alternative interfaces.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
