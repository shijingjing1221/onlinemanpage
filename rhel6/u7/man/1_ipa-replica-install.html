<p>NAME ipa-replica-install - Create an IPA replica</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-replica-install [OPTION]...
replica_file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Configures a new IPA server that is a
replica of the server that gener- ated it. Once it has been
created it is an exact copy of the original IPA server and
is an equal master. Changes made to any master are auto-
matically replicated to other masters.</p>

<p>The replica_file is created using the
ipa-replica-prepare utility.</p>

<p>If the installation fails you may need to run
ipa-server-install --uninstall before running
ipa-replica-install again.</p>

<p>The installation will fail if the host you are
installing the replica on exists as a host in IPA or an
existing replication agreement exists (for example, from a
previously failed installation).</p>

<p>A replica should only be installed on the same or higher
version of IPA on the remote system.</p>

<p>OPTIONS BASIC OPTIONS --setup-ca Install and configure a
CA on this replica. If a CA is not con- figured then
certificate operations will be forwarded to a mas- ter with
a CA installed.</p>

<p>--ip-address=IP_ADDRESS The IP address of this server.
If this address does not match the address the host resolves
to and --setup-dns is not selected the installation will
fail. If the server hostname is not resolvable, a record for
the hostname and IP_ADDRESS is added to /etc/hosts.</p>

<p>-p DM_PASSWORD, --password=DM_PASSWORD Directory Manager
(existing master) password</p>

<p>-w ADMIN_PASSWORD, --admin-password=ADMIN_PASSWORD Admin
user Kerberos password used for connection check</p>

<p>-N, --no-ntp Do not configure NTP</p>

<p>--no-ui-redirect Do not automatically redirect to the
Web UI.</p>

<p>--ssh-trust-dns Configure OpenSSH client to trust DNS
SSHFP records.</p>

<p>--no-ssh Do not configure OpenSSH client.</p>

<p>--no-sshd Do not configure OpenSSH server.</p>

<p>--skip-conncheck Skip connection check to remote
master</p>

<p>-d, --debug Enable debug logging when more verbose
output is needed</p>

<p>-U, --unattended An unattended installation that will
never prompt for user input</p>

<p>DNS OPTIONS --setup-dns Generate a DNS zone if it does
not exist already and configure the DNS server. This option
requires that you either specify at least one DNS forwarder
through the --forwarder option or use the --no-forwarders
option.</p>

<p>--forwarder=IP_ADDRESS Add a DNS forwarder to the DNS
configuration. You can use this option multiple times to
specify more forwarders, but at least one must be provided,
unless the --no-forwarders option is spec- ified.</p>

<p>--no-forwarders Do not add any DNS forwarders. Root DNS
servers will be used instead.</p>

<p>--reverse-zone=REVERSE_ZONE The reverse DNS zone to
use</p>

<p>--no-reverse Do not create new reverse DNS zone. If a
reverse DNS zone already exists for the subnet, it will be
used.</p>

<p>--no-host-dns Do not use DNS for hostname lookup during
installation</p>

<p>--no-dns-sshfp Do not automatically create DNS SSHFP
records.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the command was successful</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>

<p>3 if the host exists in the IPA server or a replication
agreement to the remote master already exists</p>
