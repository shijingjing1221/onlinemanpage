<p>DESCRIPTION The msgcat package provides a set of
functions that can be used to man- age multi-lingual user
interfaces. Text strings are defined in a mes- sage catalog
which is independent from the application, and which can be
edited or localized without modifying the application source
code. New languages or locales are provided by adding a new
file to the mes- sage catalog.</p>

<p>Use of the message catalog is optional by any
application or package, but is encouraged if the application
or package wishes to be enabled for multi-lingual
applications.</p>

<p>COMMANDS ::msgcat::mc src-string ?arg arg ...? Returns a
translation of src-string according to the users cur- rent
locale. If additional arguments past src-string are given,
the format command is used to substitute the additional
argu- ments in the translation of src-string.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mc will search the messages defined in the
current namespace for a translation of src-string; if none
is found, it will search in the parent of the current
namespace, and so on until it reaches the global namespace.
If no translation string exists, ::msgcat::mcunknown is
called and the string returned from ::msgcat::mcunknown is
returned.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mc is the main function used to localize an
applica- tion. Instead of using an English string directly,
an applica- tion can pass the English string through
::msgcat::mc and use the result. If an application is
written for a single language in this fashion, then it is
easy to add support for additional languages later simply by
defining new message catalog entries.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mcmax ?src-string src-string ...? Given
several source strings, ::msgcat::mcmax returns the length
of the longest translated string. This is useful when
designing localized GUIs, which may require that all
buttons, for example, be a fixed width (which will be the
width of the widest button).</p>

<p>::msgcat::mclocale ?newLocale? This function sets the
locale to newLocale. If newLocale is omitted, the current
locale is returned, otherwise the current locale is set to
newLocale. msgcat stores and compares the locale in a
case-insensitive manner, and returns locales in low- ercase.
The initial locale is determined by the locale speci- fied
in the user s environment. See LOCALE SPECIFICATION below
for a description of the locale string format.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mcpreferences Returns an ordered list of the
locales preferred by the user, based on the user s language
specification. The list is ordered from most specific to
least preference. The list is derived from the current
locale set in msgcat by ::msgcat::mclocale, and cannot be
set independently. For example, if the current locale is
en_US_funky, then ::msgcat::mcpreferences returns
{en_US_funky en_US en {}}.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mcload dirname Searches the specified
directory for files that match the lan- guage specifications
returned by ::msgcat::mcpreferences (note that these are all
lowercase), extended by the file extension .msg . Each
matching file is read in order, assuming a UTF-8 encoding.
The file contents are then evaluated as a Tcl script. This
means that Unicode characters may be present in the message
file either directly in their UTF-8 encoded form, or by use
of the backslash-u quoting recognized by Tcl evaluation. The
num- ber of message files which matched the specification
and were loaded is returned.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mcset locale src-string ?translate-string?
Sets the translation for src-string to translate-string in
the specified locale and the current namespace. If
translate-string is not specified, src-string is used for
both. The function returns translate-string.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mcmset locale src-trans-list Sets the
translation for multiple source strings in src-trans- list
in the specified locale and the current namespace. src-
trans-list must have an even number of elements and is in
the form {src-string translate-string ?src-string
translate-string ...?} ::msgcat::mcmset can be significantly
faster than multiple invocations of ::msgcat::mcset. The
function returns the number of translations set.</p>

<p>::msgcat::mcunknown locale src-string This routine is
called by ::msgcat::mc in the case when a trans- lation for
src-string is not defined in the current locale. The default
action is to return src-string. This procedure can be
redefined by the application, for example to log error
messages for each unknown string. The ::msgcat::mcunknown
procedure is invoked at the same stack context as the call
to ::msgcat::mc. The return value of ::msgcat::mcunknown is
used as the return value for the call to ::msgcat::mc.</p>

<p>LOCALE SPECIFICATION The locale is specified to msgcat
by a locale string passed to ::msg- cat::mclocale. The
locale string consists of a language code, an optional
country code, and an optional system-specific code, each
sepa- rated by _. The country and language codes are
specified in stan- dards ISO-639 and ISO-3166. For example,
the locale en specifies English and en_US specifies U.S.
English.</p>

<p>When the msgcat package is first loaded, the locale is
initialized according to the users environment. The
variables env(LC_ALL), env(LC_MESSAGES), and env(LANG) are
examined in order. The first of them to have a non-empty
value is used to determine the initial locale. The value is
parsed according to the XPG4 pattern
language[_country][.codeset][@modifier] to extract its
parts. The initial locale is then set by calling ::msg-
cat::mclocale with the argument
language[_country][_modifier] On Windows, if none of those
environment variables is set, msgcat will attempt to extract
locale information from the registry. If all these attempts
to discover an initial locale from the users environment
fail, msgcat defaults to an initial locale of C.</p>

<p>When a locale is specified by the user, a best match
search is per- formed during string translation. For
example, if a user specifies en_GB_Funky, the locales
en_GB_Funky, en_GB, en and (the empty string) are searched
in order until a matching translation string is found. If no
translation string is available, then ::msgcat::mcunknown is
called.</p>

<p>NAMESPACES AND MESSAGE CATALOGS Strings stored in the
message catalog are stored relative to the names- pace from
which they were added. This allows multiple packages to use
the same strings without fear of collisions with other
packages. It also allows the source string to be shorter and
less prone to typo- graphical error.</p>

<p>For example, executing the code ::msgcat::mcset en hello
&quot;hello from ::&quot; namespace eval foo {
::msgcat::mcset en hello &quot;hello from ::foo&quot; } puts
[::msgcat::mc hello] namespace eval foo {puts [::msgcat::mc
hello]} will print hello from :: hello from ::foo</p>

<p>When searching for a translation of a message, the
message catalog will search first the current namespace,
then the parent of the current namespace, and so on until
the global namespace is reached. This allows child
namespaces to inherit messages from their parent names-
pace.</p>

<p>For example, executing (in the en locale) the code
::msgcat::mcset en m1 &quot;:: message1&quot;
::msgcat::mcset en m2 &quot;:: message2&quot;
::msgcat::mcset en m3 &quot;:: message3&quot; namespace eval
::foo { ::msgcat::mcset en m2 &quot;::foo message2&quot;
::msgcat::mcset en m3 &quot;::foo message3&quot; } namespace
eval ::foo::bar { ::msgcat::mcset en m3 &quot;::foo::bar
message3&quot; } namespace import ::msgcat::mc puts
&quot;[mc m1]; [mc m2]; [mc m3]&quot; namespace eval ::foo
{puts &quot;[mc m1]; [mc m2]; [mc m3]&quot;} namespace eval
::foo::bar {puts &quot;[mc m1]; [mc m2]; [mc m3]&quot;} will
print :: message1; :: message2; :: message3 :: message1;
::foo message2; ::foo message3 :: message1; ::foo message2;
::foo::bar message3</p>

<p>LOCATION AND FORMAT OF MESSAGE FILES Message files can
be located in any directory, subject to the following
conditions:</p>

<p>[1] All message files for a package are in the same
directory.</p>

<p>[2] The message file name is a msgcat locale specifier
(all lower- case) followed by .msg. For example: es.msg
spanish en_gb.msg United Kingdom English Exception: The
message file for the root locale is called ROOT.msg . This
exception is made so as not to cause peculiar behav- ior,
such as marking the message file as hidden on Unix file
systems.</p>

<p>[3] The file contains a series of calls to mcset and
mcmset, setting the necessary translation strings for the
language, likely enclosed in a namespace eval so that all
source strings are tied to the namespace of the package. For
example, a short es.msg might contain: namespace eval
::mypackage { ::msgcat::mcset es &quot;Free Beer!&quot;
&quot;Cerveza Gracias!&quot; }</p>

<p>RECOMMENDED MESSAGE SETUP FOR PACKAGES If a package is
installed into a subdirectory of the tcl_pkgPath and loaded
via package require, the following procedure is
recommended.</p>

<p>[1] During package installation, create a subdirectory
msgs under your package directory.</p>

<p>[2] Copy your *.msg files into that directory.</p>

<p>[3] Add the following command to your package
initialization script: # load language files, stored in msgs
subdirectory ::msgcat::mcload [file join [file dirname [info
script]] msgs]</p>

<p>POSITIONAL CODES FOR FORMAT AND SCAN COMMANDS It is
possible that a message string used as an argument to format
might have positionally dependent parameters that might need
to be repositioned. For example, it might be syntactically
desirable to rearrange the sentence structure while
translating. format &quot;We produced %d units in location
%s&quot; $num $city format &quot;In location %s we produced
%d units&quot; $city $num</p>

<p>This can be handled by using the positional parameters:
format &quot;We produced %1 units in location %2&quot; $num
$city format &quot;In location %2 we produced %1 units&quot;
$num $city</p>

<p>Similarly, positional parameters can be used with scan
to extract val- ues from internationalized strings.</p>
