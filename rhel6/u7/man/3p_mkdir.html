<p>MKDIR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MKDIR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mkdir - make a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mkdir(const char *path, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mkdir() function shall create a new
directory with name path. The file permission bits of the
new directory shall be initialized from mode. These file
permission bits of the mode argument shall be modified by
the process file creation mask.</p>

<p>When bits in mode other than the file permission bits
are set, the meaning of these additional bits is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The directorys user ID shall be set to the process
effective user ID. The directory s group ID shall be set to
the group ID of the parent directory or to the effective
group ID of the process. Implementations shall provide a way
to initialize the directorys group ID to the group ID of the
parent directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide
an implementation-defined way to initialize the directorys
group ID to the effective group ID of the calling
process.</p>

<p>The newly created directory shall be an empty
directory.</p>

<p>If path names a symbolic link, mkdir() shall fail and
set errno to [EEXIST].</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, mkdir() shall mark for
update the st_atime, st_ctime, and st_mtime fields of the
directory. Also, the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the
directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for
update.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, mkdir() shall
return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, no directory
shall be created, and errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mkdir() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix, or write permission is denied on the parent
directory of the directory to be created.</p>

<p>EEXIST The named file exists.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>EMLINK The link count of the parent directory would
exceed {LINK_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of the path prefix specified by path
does not name an existing directory or path is an empty
string.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The file system does not contain enough space to
hold the con- tents of the new directory or to extend the
parent directory of the new directory.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EROFS The parent directory resides on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>The mkdir() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating a Directory The following example
shows how to create a directory named /home/cnd/mod1, with
read/write/search permissions for owner and group, and with
read/search permissions for others.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</p>

<p>int status; ... status =
mkdir(&quot;/home/cnd/mod1&quot;, S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG |
S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The mkdir() function originated in 4.2 BSD and
was added to System V in Release 3.0.</p>

<p>4.3 BSD detects [ENAMETOOLONG].</p>

<p>The POSIX.1-1990 standard required that the group ID of
a newly created directory be set to the group ID of its
parent directory or to the effective group ID of the
creating process. FIPS 151-2 required that implementations
provide a way to have the group ID be set to the group ID of
the containing directory, but did not prohibit
implementations also supporting a way to set the group ID to
the effective group ID of the creating process. Conforming
applications should not assume which group ID will be used.
If it matters, an application can use chown() to set the
group ID after the directory is created, or determine under
what conditions the implementation will set the desired
group ID.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
