<p>PROBE::IOBLOCK.REQ(3stapIO Scheduler and block IO
TapPROBE::IOBLOCK.REQ(3stap)</p>

<p>NAME probe::ioblock.request - Fires whenever making a
generic block I/O request.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ioblock.request</p>

<p>VALUES None</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION name - name of the probe point devname -
block device name ino - i-node number of the mapped file
sector - beginning sector for the entire bio flags - see
below BIO_UPTODATE 0 ok after I/O completion BIO_RW_BLOCK 1
RW_AHEAD set, and read/write would block BIO_EOF 2
out-out-bounds error BIO_SEG_VALID 3 nr_hw_seg valid
BIO_CLONED 4 doesn&acute;t own data BIO_BOUNCED 5 bio is a
bounce bio BIO_USER_MAPPED 6 contains user pages
BIO_EOPNOTSUPP 7 not supported</p>

<p>rw - binary trace for read/write request vcnt - bio
vector count which represents number of array element (page,
offset, length) which make up this I/O request idx - offset
into the bio vector array phys_segments - number of segments
in this bio after physical address coalescing is performed
hw_segments - number of segments after physical and DMA
remapping hardware coalescing is performed size - total size
in bytes bdev - target block device bdev_contains - points
to the device object which contains the partition (when bio
structure represents a partition) p_start_sect - points to
the start sector of the partition structure of the
device</p>

<p>CONTEXT The process makes block I/O request</p>
