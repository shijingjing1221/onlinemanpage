<p>NAME isdnctrl - ISDN control device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/isdn.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION /dev/isdnctrl is a character device with
major number 45 and minor num- bers 64 to 127. It allows
controlling functionality of the Linux ISDN subsystem.</p>

<p>IOCTL FUNCTIONS Currently, the following ioctl calls are
supported:</p>

<p>IIOCNETAIF Add an ISDN network interface. This function
adds a network interface to the kernels device table. This
interface can be used just like normal eth inter- faces.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a zero terminated string
of max. 10 characters. if arg is NULL, the kernel assigns a
name.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the name of the new interface is
copied to arg. and the call returns 0. On failure, an error
code is returned.</p>

<p>IIOCNETASL Create a slave interface. Creates a slave
interface for RAW-device channel-bundling. These devices
behave like network-interfaces, execpt they are invisible to
user. Only ISDN parameters can be controlled, but no
IP-parameters. IP-parameters are inherited from the corre-
sponding master-device.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a zero terminated string
of max. 21 characters containing two comma-separated names.
The first part is the name of an existing ISDN network
device, which will be master. The second part will be the
name of the new slave interface.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the name of the new interface is
copied to arg. and the call returns 0. On failure, an error
code is returned.</p>

<p>IIOCNETDIF Delete a network-interface. This call deletes
an existing ISDN network interface.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a zero terminated string
of max. 10 characters naming an existing interface which
will be deleted. If the interface is a master interface, all
its slave-interfaces will be deleted also.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0. On failure, an
error code is returned.</p>

<p>IIOCNETSCF Set configurable parameters of an ISDN
network interface. This call replaces all ISDN related
parameters of an interface by the parameters given.</p>

<p>Argument: arg shoud point to a struct isdn_net_ioctl_cfg
(defined in linux/isdn.h)</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0. On failure, an
error code is returned.</p>

<p>IIOCNETGCF Get configurable parameters of an ISDN
network interface. This call returns all ISDN related
parameters of an interface.</p>

<p>Argument: arg shoud point to a struct isdn_net_ioctl_cfg
(defined in linux/isdn.h) which will be filled by the
current setup.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the
interface-setup is copied to *arg. On failure, an error code
is returned.</p>

<p>IIOCNETANM Add a phone number to an ISDN network
interface. This call adds a phone number to an existing
network interface.</p>

<p>Argument: arg shoud point to a struct
isdn_net_ioctl_phone which contains necessary
information.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the phone
number is added to either outgoing or incoming number list.
On failure, an error code is returned.</p>

<p>IIOCNETDNM Delete a phone number from an ISDN network
interface. This call deletes a phone number from an existing
network inter- face.</p>

<p>Argument: arg shoud point to a struct
isdn_net_ioctl_phone which contains necessary
information.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the phone
number is deleted from either outgoing or incoming number
list. On failure, an error code is returned.</p>

<p>IIOCNETGNM Get list of phone numbers from an ISDN
network interface. This call returns the list of phone
numbers associated to an existing network interface.</p>

<p>Argument: arg shoud point to a a union of struct
isdn_net_ioctl_phone and a buffer, large enough to hold a
concatenated list of strings containing the phone num-
bers.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the list of
phone num- bers is returned as a space-separated list of
number- strings terminated by a NULL byte.</p>

<p>IIOCNETDIL Trigger dialing of an ISDN network interface.
This call initiates dialing of an ISDN network interface, if
it is not connected. Normally, this ioctl is not needed,
because ISDN network interface perform dial on demand by
deafult.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a zero terminated string
of max. 10 characters naming the desired interface.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the interface
starts dialing.</p>

<p>IIOCNETHUP Hangup an ISDN network interface. This call
initiates hangup of an ISDN network interface, if it is
connected.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a zero terminated string
of max. 10 characters naming the desired interface.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the interface
hangs up.</p>

<p>IIOCNETALN Add a link of an MPP-configured ISDN network
interface. This call initiates dialing of a Multilink-PPP
slave ISDN net- work interface, if it is not connected.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a zero terminated string
of max. 10 characters naming the desired interface.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the interface
starts dialing.</p>

<p>IIOCNETDLN Hangup an MPP-configured ISDN network
interface. This call initiates hangup of an Multilink-PPP
ISDN network interface, if it is connected.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a zero terminated string
of max. 10 characters naming the desired interface.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the interface
hangs up.</p>

<p>IIOCNETARU Add a timeout rule to an ISDN network
interface. This call adds a timeout rule to an existing
interface.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a struct
isdn_ioctl_timeout_rule con- taining the necessary
parameters.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the rule is
added to the rule list of the interface.</p>

<p>IIOCNETDRU Delete a timeout rule from an ISDN network
interface. This call deletes a timeout rule from an existing
interface.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a struct
isdn_ioctl_timeout_rule con- taining the necessary
parameters.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the rule is
deleted from the rule list of the interface.</p>

isdn_ioctl_timeout_rule con- taining the necessary
parameters.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the struct is
filled from the rule list of the interface.</p>

<p>IIOCNETBUD Handle budget accounting of an ISDN network
interface.</p>

<p>Argument and Return: to be defined.</p>

<p>IIOCSETVER Set verbosity of link level.</p>

<p>Argument: arg is an integer, defining the new verbose
value.</p>

<p>Return: This call always returns 0.</p>

<p>IIOCSETGST Set global stop flag of link level.</p>

<p>Argument: arg is an integer, defining the new stop flag
value (0 or !0).</p>

<p>Return: This call always returns 0.</p>

<p>IIOCSETBRJ Set busreject flag of a lowlevel driver.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to an struct
isdn_ioctl_struct contain- ing the driver s ID and the value
of the busreject flag.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the call returns 0 and the busreject
flag of the selected driver is set according the given
parameter.</p>

<p>IIOCSIGPRF Enable signaling on change of modem profiles.
With this call, the calling process is registered to receive
a SIGIO on every change of any register of any ttyI. Thus it
can read register settings and save them to a file. The
calling pro- cess has to keep the device open in order to
receive notifica- tions. As soon as it closes the device,
registration is deleted.</p>

<p>Argument: none</p>

<p>Return: This call always returns 0.</p>

<p>IIOCGETPRF Get all modem register settings. With this
call, all modem registers of all ttyI devices can be
read.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a buffer of length (
ISDN_MODEM_ANZREG + ISDN_MSNLEN ) * ISDN_MAX_CHANNELS.</p>

<p>Return: On return, the provided buffer is filled with
the regis- ter values.</p>

<p>IIOCSETPRF Set all modem register settings. With this
call, all modem registers of all ttyI devices can be
written.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a buffer of length (
ISDN_MODEM_ANZREG + ISDN_MSNLEN ) * ISDN_MAX_CHANNELS.
filled with the values of all modem registers.</p>

<p>Return: On return, the modem registers are set from the
contents of the provided buffer.</p>

<p>IIOCSETMAP Set Mapping table. This call is used to set
EAZ/MSN mapping of a lowlevel driver.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a struct isdn_ioctl_struct
containing the necessary parameters.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the mapping table is set from the
given parameters an the call returns 0.</p>

<p>IIOCGETMAP Get Mapping table. This call is used to get
EAZ/MSN mapping of a lowlevel driver.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a struct isdn_ioctl_struct
containing the necessary parameters.</p>

<p>Return: On success, the current mapping table of the
given driver is returned and the call returns 0.</p>

<p>IIOCDRVCTL Lowlevel driver ioctl. This call is used for
controlling various lowlevel drivers. The ioctl-code for
this command is assembled by adding IIOCDRVCTL (128) and the
desired driver ioctl-code. Therefore, a lowlevel driver can
understand a maximum of 127 different ioctls.</p>

<p>Argument: arg should point to a struct isdn_ioctl_struct
containing the necessary parameters, especially the
driver-Id must be filled correctly. The arg component inside
isdn_ioctl_struct is handed down to the drivers ioctl
function. Its meaning is not defined here and depends on the
lowlevel driver. See documentation for the various lewlevel
drivers for information about driver- specific ioctl.</p>

<p>Return: The return code depends on the drivers ioctl
function. Usually, 0 means no error.</p>
