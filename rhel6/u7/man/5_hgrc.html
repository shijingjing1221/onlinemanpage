<p>HGRC(5) Mercurial Manual HGRC(5)</p>

<p>NAME hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The Mercurial system uses a set of
configuration files to control aspects of its behavior.</p>

<p>FILES Mercurial reads configuration data from several
files, if they exist. The names of these files depend on the
system on which Mercurial is installed. *.rc files from a
single directory are read in alphabetical order, later ones
overriding earlier ones. Where multiple paths are given
below, settings from earlier paths override later ones.
(Unix, Windows) &lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc</p>

<p>Per-repository configuration options that only apply in
a particu- lar repository. This file is not
version-controlled, and will not get transferred during a
&quot;clone&quot; operation. Options in this file override
options in all other configuration files. On Unix, most of
this file will be ignored if it doesn&rsquo;t belong to a
trusted user or to a trusted group. See the documentation
for the trusted section below for more details. (Unix)
$HOME/.hgrc (Windows) %USERPROFILE.hgrc (Windows)
%USERPROFILEMercurial.ini (Windows) %HOME.hgrc (Windows)
%HOMEMercurial.ini</p>

<p>Per-user configuration file(s), for the user running
Mercurial. On Windows 9x, %HOME% is replaced by %APPDATA%.
Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands
executed by this user in any direc- tory. Options in these
files override per-system and per-installa- tion options.
(Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc (Unix)
/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</p>

<p>Per-system configuration files, for the system on which
Mercurial is running. Options in these files apply to all
Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory.
Options in these files over- ride per-installation options.
(Unix) &lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc (Unix)
&lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc</p>

<p>Per-installation configuration files, searched for in
the directory where Mercurial is installed.
&lt;install-root&gt; is the parent direc- tory of the hg
executable (or symlink) being run. For example, if installed
in /shared/tools/bin/hg, Mercurial will look in
/shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc. Options in these files
apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any
directory. (Windows) CMercuriaMercurial.ini (Windows)
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINOFTWARMercurial (Windows)
&lt;install-dirMercurial.ini</p>

<p>Per-installation/system configuration files, for the
system on which Mercurial is running. Options in these files
apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any
directory. Registry keys contain PATH-like strings, every
part of which must reference a Mercurial.ini file or be a
directory where *.rc files will be read.</p>

<p>SYNTAX A configuration file consists of sections, led by
a [section] header and followed by name = value entries:</p>

<p>[spam] eggs=ham green= eggs</p>

<p>Each line contains one entry. If the lines that follow
are indented, they are treated as continuations of that
entry. Leading whitespace is removed from values. Empty
lines are skipped. Lines beginning with # or ; are ignored
and may be used to provide comments.</p>

<p>A line of the form %include file will include file into
the current configuration file. The inclusion is recursive,
which means that included files can include other files.
Filenames are relative to the configuration file in which
the %include directive is found.</p>

<p>A line with %unset name will remove name from the
current section, if it has been set previously.</p>

<p>SECTIONS This section describes the different sections
that may appear in a Mer- curial &quot;hgrc&quot; file, the
purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their
possible values.</p>

<p>alias Defines command aliases. Aliases allow you to
define your own commands in terms of other commands (or
aliases), optionally including argu- ments.</p>

<p>Alias definitions consist of lines of the form:</p>

<p>&lt;alias&gt; = &lt;command&gt; [&lt;argument]...</p>

<p>For example, this definition:</p>

<p>latest = log --limit 5</p>

<p>creates a new command latest that shows only the five
most recent changesets. You can define subsequent aliases
using earlier ones:</p>

<p>stable5 = latest -b stable</p>

<p>Note It is possible to create aliases with the same
names as existing commands, which will then override the
original definitions. This is almost always a bad idea!</p>

<p>auth Authentication credentials for HTTP authentication.
Each line has the following format:</p>

<p>&lt;name&gt;.&lt;argument&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;name&gt; is used to group arguments into
authentication entries. Example:</p>

<p>foo.prefix = hg.intevation.org/mercurial foo.username =
foo foo.password = bar foo.schemes = http https</p>

<p>bar.prefix = secure.example.org bar.key =
path/to/file.key bar.cert = path/to/file.cert bar.schemes =
https</p>

<p>Supported arguments:</p>

<p>prefix</p>

<p>Either * or a URI prefix with or without the scheme
part. The authentication entry with the longest matching
prefix is used (where * matches everything and counts as a
match of length 1). If the prefix doesn&rsquo;t include a
scheme, the match is performed against the URI with its
scheme stripped as well, and the schemes argument, q.v., is
then subsequently consulted.</p>

<p>username</p>

<p>Optional. Username to authenticate with. If not given,
and the remote site requires basic or digest authentication,
the user will be prompted for it.</p>

<p>password</p>

<p>Optional. Password to authenticate with. If not given,
and the remote site requires basic or digest authentication,
the user will be prompted for it.</p>

<p>key</p>

<p>Optional. PEM encoded client certificate key file.</p>

<p>cert</p>

<p>Optional. PEM encoded client certificate chain file.</p>

<p>schemes</p>

<p>Optional. Space separated list of URI schemes to use
this authentication entry with. Only used if the prefix
doesn&rsquo;t include a scheme. Supported schemes are http
and https. They will match static-http and static-https
respectively, as well. Default: https.</p>

<p>If no suitable authentication entry is found, the user
is prompted for credentials as usual if required by the
remote.</p>

<p>decode/encode Filters for transforming files on
checkout/checkin. This would typi- cally be used for newline
processing or other localization/canonical- ization of
files.</p>

<p>Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter
command. Fil- ter patterns are globs by default, rooted at
the repository root. For example, to match any file ending
in .txt in the root directory only, use the pattern *.txt.
To match any file ending in .c anywhere in the repository,
use the pattern **.c.</p>

<p>The filter command can start with a specifier, either
pipe: or temp- file:. If no specifier is given, pipe: is
used by default.</p>

<p>A pipe: command must accept data on stdin and return the
transformed data on stdout.</p>

<p>Pipe example:</p>

<p>[encode] # uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve
delta compression # note: not necessarily a good idea, just
an example *.gz = pipe: gunzip</p>

<p>[decode] # recompress gzip files when writing them to
the working dir (we # can safely omit &quot;pipe:&quot;,
because it&rsquo;s the default) *.gz = gzip</p>

<p>A tempfile: command is a template. The string INFILE is
replaced with the name of a temporary file that contains the
data to be filtered by the command. The string OUTFILE is
replaced with the name of an empty temporary file, where the
filtered data must be written by the command.</p>

<p>Note The tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows
systems, where the standard shell I/O redirection operators
often have strange effects and may corrupt the contents of
your files.</p>

<p>The most common usage is for LF &lt;-&gt; CRLF
translation on Windows. For this, use the &quot;smart&quot;
converters which check for binary files:</p>

<p>[extensions] hgext.win32text = [encode] ** =
cleverencode: [decode] ** = cleverdecode:</p>

<p>or if you only want to translate certain files:</p>

<p>[extensions] hgext.win32text = [encode] **.txt =
dumbencode: [decode] **.txt = dumbdecode:</p>

<p>defaults (defaults are deprecated. Don&rsquo;t use them.
Use aliases instead)</p>

<p>Use the [defaults] section to define command defaults,
i.e. the default options/arguments to pass to the specified
commands.</p>

<p>The following example makes hg log run in verbose mode,
and hg status show only the modified files, by default:</p>

<p>[defaults] log = -v status = -m</p>

<p>The actual commands, instead of their aliases, must be
used when defin- ing command defaults. The command defaults
will also be applied to the aliases of the commands
defined.</p>

<p>diff Settings used when displaying diffs. They are all
Boolean and defaults to False.</p>

<p>git</p>

<p>Use git extended diff format.</p>

<p>nodates</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t include dates in diff headers.</p>

<p>showfunc</p>

<p>Show which function each change is in.</p>

<p>ignorews</p>

<p>Ignore white space when comparing lines.</p>

<p>ignorewsamount</p>

<p>Ignore changes in the amount of white space.</p>

<p>ignoreblanklines</p>

<p>Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</p>

<p>email Settings for extensions that send email
messages.</p>

<p>from</p>

<p>Optional. Email address to use in &quot;From&quot;
header and SMTP enve- lope of outgoing messages.</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>Optional. Comma-separated list of recipients&rsquo;
email addresses.</p>

<p>cc</p>

<p>Optional. Comma-separated list of carbon copy
recipients&rsquo; email addresses.</p>

<p>bcc</p>

<p>Optional. Comma-separated list of blind carbon copy
recipients&rsquo; email addresses. Cannot be set
interactively.</p>

<p>method</p>

<p>Optional. Method to use to send email messages. If value
is smtp (default), use SMTP (see the SMTP section for
configuration). Otherwise, use as name of program to run
that acts like sendmail (takes -f option for sender, list of
recipients on command line, message on stdin). Normally,
setting this to sendmail or /usr/sbin/sendmail is enough to
use sendmail to send messages.</p>

<p>charsets</p>

<p>Optional. Comma-separated list of character sets
considered con- venient for recipients. Addresses, headers,
and parts not con- taining patches of outgoing messages will
be encoded in the first character set to which conversion
from local encoding ($HGENCODING, ui.fallbackencoding)
succeeds. If correct conver- sion fails, the text in
question is sent as is. Defaults to empty (explicit)
list.</p>

<p>Order of outgoing email character sets:</p>

<p>1. us-ascii: always first, regardless of settings</p>

<p>2. email.charsets: in order given by user</p>

<p>3. ui.fallbackencoding: if not in email.charsets</p>

<p>4. $HGENCODING: if not in email.charsets</p>

<p>5. utf-8: always last, regardless of settings</p>

<p>Email example:</p>

<p>[email] from = Joseph User &lt;joe.user@example.com&gt;
method = /usr/sbin/sendmail # charsets for western Europeans
# us-ascii, utf-8 omitted, as they are tried first and last
charsets = iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15, windows-1252</p>

<p>extensions Mercurial has an extension mechanism for
adding new features. To enable an extension, create an entry
for it in this section.</p>

<p>If you know that the extension is already in
Python&rsquo;s search path, you can give the name of the
module, followed by =, with nothing after the =.</p>

<p>Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by =,
followed by the path to the .py file (including the file
name extension) that defines the extension.</p>

<p>To explicitly disable an extension that is enabled in an
hgrc of broader scope, prepend its path with !, as in
hgext.foo = !/ext/path or hgext.foo = ! when path is not
supplied.</p>

<p>Example for ~/.hgrc:</p>

<p>[extensions] # (the mq extension will get loaded from
Mercurial&rsquo;s path) hgext.mq = # (this extension will
get loaded from the file specified) myfeature =
~/.hgext/myfeature.py</p>

<p>format usestore</p>

<p>Enable or disable the &quot;store&quot; repository
format which improves compatibility with systems that fold
case or otherwise mangle filenames. Enabled by default.
Disabling this option will allow you to store longer
filenames in some situations at the expense of compatibility
and ensures that the on-disk format of newly created
repositories will be compatible with Mercurial before
version 0.9.4.</p>

<p>usefncache</p>

<p>Enable or disable the &quot;fncache&quot; repository
format which enhances the &quot;store&quot; repository
format (which has to be enabled to use fncache) to allow
longer filenames and avoids using Windows reserved names,
e.g. &quot;nul&quot;. Enabled by default. Disabling this
option ensures that the on-disk format of newly created
reposi- tories will be compatible with Mercurial before
version 1.1.</p>

<p>merge-patterns This section specifies merge tools to
associate with particular file patterns. Tools matched here
will take precedence over the default merge tool. Patterns
are globs by default, rooted at the repository root.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>[merge-patterns] **.c = kdiff3 **.jpg = myimgmerge</p>

<p>merge-tools This section configures external merge tools
to use for file-level merges.</p>

<p>Example ~/.hgrc:</p>

<p>[merge-tools] # Override stock tool location
kdiff3.executable = ~/bin/kdiff3 # Specify command line
kdiff3.args = $base $local $other -o $output # Give higher
priority kdiff3.priority = 1</p>

<p># Define new tool myHtmlTool.args = -m $local $other
$base $output myHtmlTool.regkey = SoftwareoSoftwarelMerge
myHtmlTool.priority = 1</p>

<p>Supported arguments:</p>

<p>priority</p>

<p>The priority in which to evaluate this tool. Default:
0.</p>

<p>executable</p>

<p>Either just the name of the executable or its pathname.
Default: the tool name.</p>

<p>args</p>

<p>The arguments to pass to the tool executable. You can
refer to the files being merged as well as the output file
through these variables: $base, $local, $other, $output.
Default: $local $base $other</p>

<p>premerge</p>

<p>Attempt to run internal non-interactive 3-way merge tool
before launching external tool. Default: True</p>

<p>binary</p>

<p>This tool can merge binary files. Defaults to False,
unless tool was selected by file pattern match.</p>

<p>symlink</p>

<p>This tool can merge symlinks. Defaults to False, even if
tool was selected by file pattern match.</p>

<p>checkconflicts</p>

<p>Check whether there are conflicts even though the tool
reported success. Default: False</p>

<p>checkchanged</p>

<p>Check whether outputs were written even though the tool
reported success. Default: False</p>

<p>fixeol</p>

<p>Attempt to fix up EOL changes caused by the merge tool.
Default: False</p>

<p>gui</p>

<p>This tool requires a graphical interface to run.
Default: False</p>

<p>regkey</p>

<p>Windows registry key which describes install location of
this tool. Mercurial will search for this key first under
HKEY_CUR- RENT_USER and then under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
Default: None</p>

<p>regname</p>

<p>Name of value to read from specified registry key.
Defaults to the unnamed (default) value.</p>

<p>regappend</p>

<p>String to append to the value read from the registry,
typically the executable name of the tool. Default: None</p>

<p>hooks Commands or Python functions that get
automatically executed by various actions such as starting
or finishing a commit. Multiple hooks can be run for the
same action by appending a suffix to the action. Overriding
a site-wide hook can be done by changing its value or
setting it to an empty string.</p>

<p>Example .hg/hgrc:</p>

<p>[hooks] # update working directory after adding
changesets changegroup.update = hg update # do not use the
site-wide hook incoming = incoming.email = /my/email/hook
incoming.autobuild = /my/build/hook</p>

<p>Most hooks are run with environment variables set that
give useful additional information. For each hook below, the
environment variables it is passed are listed with names of
the form $HG_foo.</p>

<p>changegroup</p>

<p>Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or
unbun- dle. ID of the first new changeset is in $HG_NODE.
URL from which changes came is in $HG_URL.</p>

<p>commit</p>

<p>Run after a changeset has been created in the local
repository. ID of the newly created changeset is in
$HG_NODE. Parent change- set IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and
$HG_PARENT2.</p>

<p>incoming</p>

<p>Run after a changeset has been pulled, pushed, or
unbundled into the local repository. The ID of the newly
arrived changeset is in $HG_NODE. URL that was source of
changes came is in $HG_URL.</p>

<p>outgoing</p>

<p>Run after sending changes from local repository to
another. ID of first changeset sent is in $HG_NODE. Source
of operation is in $HG_SOURCE; see &quot;preoutgoing&quot;
hook for description.</p>

<p>post-&lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>Run after successful invocations of the associated
command. The contents of the command line are passed as
$HG_ARGS and the result code in $HG_RESULT. Hook failure is
ignored.</p>

<p>pre-&lt;command&gt;</p>

<p>Run before executing the associated command. The
contents of the command line are passed as $HG_ARGS. If the
hook returns fail- ure, the command doesn&rsquo;t execute
and Mercurial returns the fail- ure code.</p>

<p>prechangegroup</p>

<p>Run before a changegroup is added via push, pull or
unbundle. Exit status 0 allows the changegroup to proceed.
Non-zero status will cause the push, pull or unbundle to
fail. URL from which changes will come is in $HG_URL.</p>

<p>precommit</p>

<p>Run before starting a local commit. Exit status 0 allows
the commit to proceed. Non-zero status will cause the commit
to fail. Parent changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and
$HG_PARENT2.</p>

<p>preoutgoing</p>

<p>Run before collecting changes to send from the local
repository to another. Non-zero status will cause failure.
This lets you prevent pull over HTTP or SSH. Also prevents
against local pull, push (outbound) or bundle commands, but
not effective, since you can just copy files instead then.
Source of operation is in $HG_SOURCE. If &quot;serve&quot;,
operation is happening on behalf of remote SSH or HTTP
repository. If &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pull&quot; or
&quot;bundle&quot;, operation is happening on behalf of
repository on same system.</p>

<p>pretag</p>

<p>Run before creating a tag. Exit status 0 allows the tag
to be created. Non-zero status will cause the tag to fail.
ID of changeset to tag is in $HG_NODE. Name of tag is in
$HG_TAG. Tag is local if $HG_LOCAL=1, in repository if
$HG_LOCAL=0.</p>

<p>pretxnchangegroup</p>

<p>Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or
unbun- dle, but before the transaction has been committed.
Changegroup is visible to hook program. This lets you
validate incoming changes before accepting them. Passed the
ID of the first new changeset in $HG_NODE. Exit status 0
allows the transaction to commit. Non-zero status will cause
the transaction to be rolled back and the push, pull or
unbundle will fail. URL that was source of changes is in
$HG_URL.</p>

<p>pretxncommit</p>

<p>Run after a changeset has been created but the
transaction not yet committed. Changeset is visible to hook
program. This lets you validate commit message and changes.
Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed. Non-zero status
will cause the transac- tion to be rolled back. ID of
changeset is in $HG_NODE. Parent changeset IDs are in
$HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2.</p>

<p>preupdate</p>

<p>Run before updating the working directory. Exit status 0
allows the update to proceed. Non-zero status will prevent
the update. Changeset ID of first new parent is in
$HG_PARENT1. If merge, ID of second new parent is in
$HG_PARENT2.</p>

<p>tag</p>

<p>Run after a tag is created. ID of tagged changeset is in
$HG_NODE. Name of tag is in $HG_TAG. Tag is local if
$HG_LOCAL=1, in repository if $HG_LOCAL=0.</p>

<p>update</p>

<p>Run after updating the working directory. Changeset ID
of first new parent is in $HG_PARENT1. If merge, ID of
second new parent is in $HG_PARENT2. If the update
succeeded, $HG_ERROR=0. If the update failed (e.g. because
conflicts not resolved), $HG_ERROR=1.</p>

<p>Note It is generally better to use standard hooks rather
than the generic pre- and post- command hooks as they are
guaranteed to be called in the appropriate contexts for
influencing transac- tions. Also, hooks like
&quot;commit&quot; will be called in all contexts that
generate a commit (e.g. tag) and not just the commit com-
mand.</p>

<p>Note Environment variables with empty values may not be
passed to hooks on platforms such as Windows. As an example,
$HG_PARENT2 will have an empty value under Unix-like
platforms for non-merge changesets, while it will not be
available at all under Windows.</p>

<p>The syntax for Python hooks is as follows:</p>

<p>hookname = python:modulename.submodule.callable hookname
= python:/path/to/python/module.py:callable</p>

<p>Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process. Each
hook is called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui
object (keyword ui), a repository object (keyword repo), and
a hooktype keyword that tells what kind of hook is used.
Arguments listed as environment variables above are passed
as keyword arguments, with no HG_ prefix, and names in lower
case.</p>

<p>If a Python hook returns a &quot;true&quot; value or
raises an exception, this is treated as a failure.</p>

<p>http_proxy Used to access web-based Mercurial
repositories through a HTTP proxy.</p>

<p>host</p>

<p>Host name and (optional) port of the proxy server, for
example &quot;myproxy:8000&quot;.</p>

<p>no</p>

<p>Optional. Comma-separated list of host names that should
bypass the proxy.</p>

<p>passwd</p>

<p>Optional. Password to authenticate with at the proxy
server.</p>

<p>user</p>

<p>Optional. User name to authenticate with at the proxy
server.</p>

<p>smtp Configuration for extensions that need to send
email messages.</p>

<p>host</p>

<p>Host name of mail server, e.g.
&quot;mail.example.com&quot;.</p>

<p>port</p>

<p>Optional. Port to connect to on mail server. Default:
25.</p>

<p>tls</p>

<p>Optional. Whether to connect to mail server using TLS.
True or False. Default: False.</p>

<p>username</p>

<p>Optional. User name to authenticate to SMTP server with.
If username is specified, password must also be specified.
Default: none.</p>

<p>password</p>

<p>Optional. Password to authenticate to SMTP server with.
If user- name is specified, password must also be specified.
Default: none.</p>

<p>local_hostname</p>

<p>Optional. It&rsquo;s the hostname that the sender can
use to identify itself to the MTA.</p>

<p>patch Settings used when applying patches, for instance
through the &rsquo;import&rsquo; command or with Mercurial
Queues extension.</p>

<p>eol</p>

<p>When set to &rsquo;strict&rsquo; patch content and
patched files end of lines are preserved. When set to lf or
crlf, both files end of lines are ignored when patching and
the result line endings are normalized to either LF (Unix)
or CRLF (Windows). Default: strict.</p>

<p>paths Assigns symbolic names to repositories. The left
side is the symbolic name, and the right gives the directory
or URL that is the location of the repository. Default paths
can be declared by setting the following entries.</p>

<p>default</p>

<p>Directory or URL to use when pulling if no source is
specified. Default is set to repository from which the
current repository was cloned.</p>

<p>default-push</p>

<p>Optional. Directory or URL to use when pushing if no
destination is specified.</p>

<p>profiling Specifies profiling format and file output. In
this section descrip- tion, &rsquo;profiling data&rsquo;
stands for the raw data collected during profil- ing, while
&rsquo;profiling report&rsquo; stands for a statistical text
report gen- erated from the profiling data. The profiling is
done using lsprof.</p>

<p>format</p>

<p>Profiling format. Default: text.</p>

<p>text</p>

<p>Generate a profiling report. When saving to a file, it
should be noted that only the report is saved, and the
profiling data is not kept.</p>

<p>kcachegrind</p>

<p>Format profiling data for kcachegrind use: when saving
to a file, the generated file can directly be loaded into
kcachegrind.</p>

<p>output</p>

<p>File path where profiling data or report should be
saved. If the file exists, it is replaced. Default: None,
data is printed on stderr</p>

<p>server Controls generic server settings.</p>

<p>uncompressed</p>

<p>Whether to allow clients to clone a repository using the
uncom- pressed streaming protocol. This transfers about 40%
more data than a regular clone, but uses less memory and CPU
on both server and client. Over a LAN (100 Mbps or better)
or a very fast WAN, an uncompressed streaming clone is a lot
faster (~10x) than a regular clone. Over most WAN
connections (anything slower than about 6 Mbps),
uncompressed streaming is slower, because of the extra data
transfer overhead. Default is False.</p>

<p>trusted For security reasons, Mercurial will not use the
settings in the .hg/hgrc file from a repository if it
doesn&rsquo;t belong to a trusted user or to a trusted
group. The main exception is the web interface, which
automatically uses some safe settings, since it&rsquo;s
common to serve repositories from different users.</p>

<p>This section specifies what users and groups are
trusted. The current user is always trusted. To trust
everybody, list a user or a group with name *.</p>

<p>users</p>

<p>Comma-separated list of trusted users.</p>

<p>groups</p>

<p>Comma-separated list of trusted groups.</p>

<p>ui User interface controls.</p>

<p>archivemeta</p>

<p>Whether to include the .hg_archival.txt file containing
meta data (hashes for the repository base and for tip) in
archives created by the hg archive command or downloaded via
hgweb. Default is True.</p>

<p>askusername</p>

<p>Whether to prompt for a username when committing. If
True, and neither $HGUSER nor $EMAIL has been specified,
then the user will be prompted to enter a username. If no
username is entered, the default USER@HOST is used instead.
Default is False.</p>

<p>debug</p>

<p>Print debugging information. True or False. Default is
False.</p>

<p>editor</p>

<p>The editor to use during a commit. Default is $EDITOR or
vi.</p>

<p>A file to read per-user ignore patterns from. This file
should be in the same format as a repository-wide .hgignore

<p>slash</p>

<p>Display paths using a slash (/) as the path separator.

False.</p>

<p>username</p>

<p>The committer of a changeset created when running
&quot;commit&quot;. Typically a person&rsquo;s name and
email address, e.g. Fred Widget &lt;fred@example.com&gt;.
Default is $EMAIL or username@hostname. If the username in
hgrc is empty, it has to be specified manually or in a
different hgrc file (e.g. $HOME/.hgrc, if the admin set
username = in the system hgrc).</p>

<p>verbose</p>

<p>Increase the amount of output printed. True or False.
Default is False.</p>

<p>web Web interface configuration.</p>

<p>accesslog</p>

<p>Where to output the access log. Default is stdout.</p>

<p>address</p>

<p>Interface address to bind to. Default is all.</p>

<p>allow_archive</p>

<p>List of archive format (bz2, gz, zip) allowed for
downloading. Default is empty.</p>

<p>allowbz2</p>

<p>(DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.bz2 downloading of
repository revisions. Default is False.</p>

<p>allowgz</p>

<p>(DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.gz downloading of
repository revisions. Default is False.</p>

<p>allowpull</p>

<p>Whether to allow pulling from the repository. Default is
True.</p>

<p>allow_push</p>

<p>Whether to allow pushing to the repository. If empty or
not set, push is not allowed. If the special value *, any
remote user can push, including unauthenticated users.
Otherwise, the remote user must have been authenticated, and
the authenticated user name must be present in this list
(separated by whitespace or ,). The contents of the
allow_push list are examined after the deny_push list.</p>

<p>allow_read</p>

<p>If the user has not already been denied repository
access due to the contents of deny_read, this list
determines whether to grant repository access to the user.
If this list is not empty, and the user is unauthenticated
or not present in the list (sepa- rated by whitespace or ,),
then access is denied for the user. If the list is empty or
not set, then access is permitted to all users by default.
Setting allow_read to the special value * is equivalent to
it not being set (i.e. access is permitted to all users).
The contents of the allow_read list are examined after the
deny_read list.</p>

<p>allowzip</p>

<p>(DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .zip downloading of
repository revisions. Default is False. This feature creates
temporary files.</p>

<p>baseurl</p>

<p>Base URL to use when publishing URLs in other locations,
so third-party tools like email notification hooks can
construct URLs. Example: http://hgserver/repos/.</p>

<p>contact</p>

<p>Name or email address of the person in charge of the
repository. Defaults to ui.username or $EMAIL or
&quot;unknown&quot; if unset or empty.</p>

<p>deny_push</p>

<p>Whether to deny pushing to the repository. If empty or
not set, push is not denied. If the special value *, all
remote users are denied push. Otherwise, unauthenticated
users are all denied, and any authenticated user name
present in this list (separated by whitespace or ,) is also
denied. The contents of the deny_push list are examined
before the allow_push list.</p>

<p>deny_read</p>

<p>Whether to deny reading/viewing of the repository. If
this list is not empty, unauthenticated users are all
denied, and any authenticated user name present in this list
(separated by whitespace or ,) is also denied access to the
repository. If set to the special value *, all remote users
are denied access (rarely needed ;). If deny_read is empty
or not set, the deter- mination of repository access depends
on the presence and con- tent of the allow_read list (see
description). If both deny_read and allow_read are empty or
not set, then access is permitted to all users by default.
If the repository is being served via hgwebdir, denied users
will not be able to see it in the list of repositories. The
contents of the deny_read list have priority over (are
examined before) the contents of the allow_read list.</p>

<p>descend</p>

<p>hgwebdir indexes will not descend into subdirectories.
Only repositories directly in the current path will be shown
(other repositories are still available from the index
corresponding to their containing path).</p>

<p>description</p>

<p>Textual description of the repository&rsquo;s purpose or
contents. Default is &quot;unknown&quot;.</p>

<p>push_ssl</p>

<p>Whether to require that inbound pushes be transported
over SSL to prevent password sniffing. Default is True.</p>

<p>staticurl</p>

<p>Base URL to use for static files. If unset, static files
(e.g. the hgicon.png favicon) will be served by the CGI
script itself. Use this setting to serve them directly with
the HTTP server. Example: http://hgserver/static/.</p>
