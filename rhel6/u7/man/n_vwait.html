<p>vwait(n) Tcl Built-In Commands vwait(n)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME vwait - Process events until a variable is
written</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vwait varName
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command enters the Tcl event loop to
process events, blocking the application if no events are
ready. It continues processing events until some event
handler sets the value of variable varName. Once var- Name
has been set, the vwait command will return as soon as the
event handler that modified varName completes. varName must
be globally scoped (either with a call to global for the
varName, or with the full namespace path specification).</p>

<p>In some cases the vwait command may not return
immediately after var- Name is set. This can happen if the
event handler that sets varName does not complete
immediately. For example, if an event handler sets varName
and then itself calls vwait to wait for a different
variable, then it may not return for a long time. During
this time the top-level vwait is blocked waiting for the
event handler to complete, so it can- not return either.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Run the event-loop continually until some event
calls exit. (You can use any variable not mentioned
elsewhere, but the name forever reminds you at a glance of
the intent.) vwait forever</p>

<p>Wait five seconds for a connection to a server socket,
otherwise close the socket and continue running the script:
# Initialise the state after 5000 set state timeout set
server [socket -server accept 12345] proc accept {args} {
global state connectionInfo set state accepted set
connectionInfo $args }</p>

<p># Wait for something to happen vwait state</p>

<p># Clean up events that could have happened close $server
after cancel set state timeout</p>

<p># Do something based on how the vwait finished... switch
$state { timeout { puts &quot;no connection on port
12345&quot; } accepted { puts &quot;connection:
$connectionInfo&quot; puts [lindex $connectionInfo 0]
&quot;Hello there!&quot; } }</p>
