<p>GIT-LS-FILES(1) Git Manual GIT-LS-FILES(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-ls-files - Show information about files in the
index and the working tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git ls-files [-z] [-t] [-v]
(--[cached|deleted|others|ignored|stage|unmerged|killed|modified])
(-[c|d|o|i|s|u|k|m]) [-x
&lt;pattern&gt;|--exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;] [-X
&lt;file&gt;|--exclude-from=&lt;file&gt;]
[--exclude-per-directory=&lt;file&gt;] [--exclude-standard]
[--error-unmatch] [--with-tree=&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
[--full-name] [--abbrev] [--] [&lt;file&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This merges the file listing in the
directory cache index with the actual working directory
list, and shows different combinations of the two.</p>

<p>One or more of the options below may be used to
determine the files shown:</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --cached Show cached files in the output
(default)</p>

<p>-d, --deleted Show deleted files in the output</p>

<p>-m, --modified Show modified files in the output</p>

<p>-o, --others Show other (i.e. untracked) files in the
output</p>

<p>-i, --ignored Show only ignored files in the output.
When showing files in the index, print only those matched by
an exclude pattern. When showing &quot;other&quot; files,
show only those matched by an exclude pattern.</p>

<p>-s, --stage Show staged contents&acute; object name,
mode bits and stage number in the output.</p>

<p>--directory If a whole directory is classified as
&quot;other&quot;, show just its name (with a trailing
slash) and not its whole contents.</p>

<p>--no-empty-directory Do not list empty directories. Has
no effect without --directory.</p>

<p>-u, --unmerged Show unmerged files in the output (forces
--stage)</p>

<p>-k, --killed Show files on the filesystem that need to
be removed due to file/directory conflicts for
checkout-index to succeed.</p>

<p>-z line termination on output.</p>

<p>-x &lt;pattern&gt;, --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt; Skips
files matching pattern. Note that pattern is a shell
wildcard pattern.</p>

<p>-X &lt;file&gt;, --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt; exclude
patterns are read from &lt;file&gt;; 1 per line.</p>

<p>--exclude-per-directory=&lt;file&gt; read additional
exclude patterns that apply only to the directory and its
subdirectories in &lt;file&gt;.</p>

<p>--exclude-standard Add the standard git exclusions:
.git/info/exclude, .gitignore in each directory, and the
users global exclusion file.</p>

<p>--error-unmatch If any &lt;file&gt; does not appear in
the index, treat this as an error (return 1).</p>

<p>--with-tree=&lt;tree-ish&gt; When using --error-unmatch
to expand the user supplied &lt;file&gt; (i.e. path pattern)
arguments to paths, pretend that paths which were removed in
the index since the named &lt;tree-ish&gt; are still
present. Using this option with -s or -u options does not
make any sense.</p>

<p>-t Identify the file status with the following tags
(followed by a space) at the start of each line:</p>

<p>H cached</p>

<p>S skip-worktree</p>

<p>M unmerged</p>

<p>R removed/deleted</p>

<p>C modified/changed</p>

<p>K to be killed</p>

<p>? other</p>

<p>-v Similar to -t, but use lowercase letters for files
that are marked as assume unchanged (see
git-update-index(1)).</p>

<p>--full-name When run from a subdirectory, the command
usually outputs paths relative to the current directory.
This option forces paths to be output relative to the
project top directory.</p>

<p>--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] Instead of showing the full 40-byte
hexadecimal object lines, show only a partial prefix. Non
default number of digits can be specified with
--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p>-- Do not interpret any more arguments as options.</p>

<p>&lt;file&gt; Files to show. If no files are given all
files which match the other specified criteria are
shown.</p>

<p>OUTPUT git ls-files just outputs the filenames unless
--stage is specified in which case it outputs:</p>

<p>[&lt;tag&gt; ]&lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;stage&gt;
&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>git ls-files --unmerged and git ls-files --stage can be
used to examine detailed information on unmerged paths.</p>

<p>For an unmerged path, instead of recording a single
mode/SHA1 pair, the index records up to three such pairs;
one from tree O in stage 1, A in stage 2, and B in stage 3.
This information can be used by the user (or the porcelain)
to see what should eventually be recorded at the path. (see
git-read-tree(1) for more information on state)</p>

<p>When -z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash
characters in pathnames are represented as , 0 and \,
respectively.</p>

<p>EXCLUDE PATTERNS git ls-files can use a list of
&quot;exclude patterns&quot; when traversing the directory
tree and finding files to show when the flags --others or
--ignored are specified. gitignore(5) specifies the format
of exclude patterns.</p>

<p>These exclude patterns come from these places, in
order:</p>

<p>1. The command line flag --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
specifies a single pattern. Patterns are ordered in the same
order they appear in the command line.</p>

<p>2. The command line flag --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt;
specifies a file containing a list of patterns. Patterns are
ordered in the same order they appear in the file.</p>

<p>3. command line flag
--exclude-per-directory=&lt;name&gt; specifies a name of the
file in each directory git ls-files examines, normally
.gitignore. Files in deeper directories take precedence.
Patterns are ordered in the same order they appear in the
files.</p>

<p>A pattern specified on the command line with --exclude
or read from the file specified with --exclude-from is
relative to the top of the directory tree. A pattern read
from a file specified by --exclude-per-directory is relative
to the directory that the pattern file appears in.</p>
