<p>NAME pbmreduce - read a PBM image and reduce it N
times</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmreduce [-floyd|-fs|-threshold] [-value val]
N [pbmfile]</p>

<p>You can abbreviate any option to its shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmreduce reads a PBM image as input and reduces it by a
factor of N, producing a PBM image as output.</p>

<p>pbmreduce duplicates a lot of the functionality of
pamditherbw; you could do something like pamscale |
pamditherbw, but pbmreduce is a lot faster.</p>

<p>You can use pbmreduce to re-halftone an image. Lets say
you have a scanner that only produces black&amp;white, not
grayscale, and it does a terrible job of halftoning (most
b&amp;w scanners fit this description). One way to fix the
halftoning is to scan at the highest possible reso- lution,
say 300 dpi, and then reduce by a factor of three or so
using pbmreduce. You can even correct the brightness of an
image, by using the -value option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS By default, pbmreduce does the halftoning after
the reduction via bous- trophedonic Floyd-Steinberg error
diffusion; however, you can use the -threshold option to
specify simple thresholding. This gives better results when
reducing line drawings.</p>

<p>The -value option alters the thresholding value for all
quantizations. It should be a real number between 0 and 1.
Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5 means lighter.</p>
