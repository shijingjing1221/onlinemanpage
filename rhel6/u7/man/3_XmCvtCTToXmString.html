<p>NAME XmCvtCTToXmString A compound string function that
converts compound text to a compound string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; XmString
XmCvtCTToXmString( char * text);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmCvtCTToXmString converts a (char *) string
in compound text format to a compound string. The
application must call XtAppInitialize before calling this
function. Conversion of compound text to compound strings is
implementation dependent.</p>

<p>text Specifies a string in compound text format to be
converted to a compound string.</p>

<p>RETURN Returns a compound string derived from the
compound text. The function allocates space to hold the
returned compound string. The application is responsible for
managing the allocated space. The application can recover
the allocated space by calling XmStringFree. The compound
text is assumed to be NULL-terminated; NULLs within the
compound text are handled correctly. The handling of
HORIZONTAL TABULATION (HT) control characters within the
compound text is undefined. The compound text format is
described in the X Consortium Standard Compound Text Encod-
ing.</p>
