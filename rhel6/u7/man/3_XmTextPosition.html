<p>NAME XmTextPosition Data type for a character position
within a text string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextPosition is an integer data type that
holds a characters posi- tion within a text string for Text
and TextField.</p>

<p>An XmTextPosition value conceptually points to the gap
between two characters. For example, consider a text string
consisting of N char- acters. A value of 0 refers to the
position immediately prior to the first character. A value
of 1 refers to the position in between the first and second
characters. A value of N refers to the position imme-
diately following the last character. Therefore, the text
string of N characters actually contains N + 1
positions.</p>
