<p>inet_aton(), inet_ntoa(): _BSD_SOURCE ||
_SVID_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION inet_aton() converts the Internet host
address cp from the IPv4 num- bers-and-dots notation into
binary form (in network byte order) and stores it in the
structure that inp points to. inet_aton() returns non-zero
if the address is valid, zero if not. The address supplied
in cp can have one of the following forms:</p>

<p>a.b.c.d Each of the four numeric parts specifies a byte
of the address; the bytes are assigned in left-to-right
order to produce the binary address.</p>

<p>a.b.c Parts a and b specify the first two bytes of the
binary address. Part c is interpreted as a 16-bit value that
defines the rightmost two bytes of the binary address. This
notation is suitable for specifying (outmoded) Class B net-
work addresses.</p>

<p>a.b Part a specifies the first byte of the binary
address. Part b is interpreted as a 24-bit value that
defines the rightmost three bytes of the binary address.
This notation is suitable for specifying (outmoded) Class C
network addresses.</p>

<p>a The value a is interpreted as a 32-bit value that is
stored directly into the binary address without any byte
rearrange- ment.</p>

<p>In all of the above forms, components of the dotted
address can be specified in decimal, octal (with a leading
0), or hexadecimal, with a leading 0X). Addresses in any of
these forms are collectively termed IPV4 numbers-and-dots
notation. The form that uses exactly four deci- mal numbers
is referred to as IPv4 dotted-decimal notation (or some-
times: IPv4 dotted-quad notation).</p>

<p>The inet_addr() function converts the Internet host
address cp from IPv4 numbers-and-dots notation into binary
data in network byte order. If the input is invalid,
INADDR_NONE (usually -1) is returned. Use of this function
is problematic because -1 is a valid address
(255.255.255.255). Avoid its use in favor of inet_aton(),
inet_pton(3), or getaddrinfo(3) which provide a cleaner way
to indicate error return.</p>

<p>The inet_network() function converts cp, a string in
IPv4 numbers-and- dots notation, into a number in host byte
order suitable for use as an Internet network address. On
success, the converted address is returned. If the input is
invalid, -1 is returned.</p>

<p>The inet_ntoa() function converts the Internet host
address in, given in network byte order, to a string in IPv4
dotted-decimal notation. The string is returned in a
statically allocated buffer, which subse- quent calls will
overwrite.</p>

<p>The inet_lnaof() function returns the local network
address part of the Internet address in. The returned value
is in host byte order.</p>

<p>The inet_netof() function returns the network number
part of the Inter- net address in. The returned value is in
host byte order.</p>

<p>The inet_makeaddr() function is the converse of
inet_netof() and inet_lnaof(). It returns an Internet host
address in network byte order, created by combining the
network number net with the local address host, both in host
byte order.</p>

<p>The structure in_addr as used in inet_ntoa(),
inet_makeaddr(), inet_lnaof() and inet_netof() is defined in
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt; as:</p>

<p>typedef uint32_t in_addr_t;</p>

<p>struct in_addr { in_addr_t s_addr; };</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD. inet_addr() and inet_ntoa() are
specified in POSIX.1-2001. inet_aton() is not specified in
POSIX.1-2001, but is available on most systems.</p>

<p>NOTES On the i386 the host byte order is Least
Significant Byte first (little endian), whereas the network
byte order, as used on the Internet, is Most Significant
Byte first (big endian).</p>

<p>inet_lnaof(), inet_netof(), and inet_makeaddr() are
legacy functions that assume they are dealing with classful
network addresses. Classful networking divides IPv4 network
addresses into host and network compo- nents at byte
boundaries, as follows:</p>

<p>Class A This address type is indicated by the value 0 in
the most significant bit of the (network byte ordered)
address. The network address is contained in the most
significant byte, and the host address occupies the
remaining three bytes.</p>

<p>Class B This address type is indicated by the binary
value 10 in the most significant two bits of the address.
The network address is contained in the two most significant
bytes, and the host address occupies the remaining two
bytes.</p>

<p>Class C This address type is indicated by the binary
value 110 in the most significant three bits of the address.
The network address is contained in the three most
significant bytes, and the host address occupies the
remaining byte.</p>

<p>Classful network addresses are now obsolete, having been
superseded by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), which
divides addresses into network and host components at
arbitrary bit (rather than byte) bound- aries.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE An example of the use of inet_aton() and
inet_ntoa() is shown below. Here are some example runs:</p>

<p>$ ./a.out 226.000.000.037 # Last byte is in octal
226.0.0.31 $ ./a.out 0x7f.1 # First byte is in hex
127.0.0.1</p>

<p>Program source</p>

<p>#define _BSD_SOURCE #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { struct in_addr
addr;</p>

<p>if (argc != 2) { fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s
&lt;dotted-address&gt;0, argv[0]); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>if (inet_aton(argv[1], &amp;addr) == 0) {
perror(&quot;inet_aton&quot;); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>printf(&quot;%s0, inet_ntoa(addr)); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}</p>
