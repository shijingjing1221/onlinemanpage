<p>XAnyEvent(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XAnyEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME XAnyEvent, XEvent - generic X event structures</p>

<p>STRUCTURES All the event structures declared in
&lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt; have the following common members:
typedef struct { int type; unsigned long serial; /* # of
last request processed by server */ Bool send_event; /* true
if this came from a SendEvent request */ Display *display;
/* Display the event was read from */ Window window; }
XAnyEvent;</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The XEvent structure is a union of the individual
structures declared for each event type: typedef union
_XEvent { int type; /* must not be changed */ XAnyEvent
xany; XKeyEvent xkey; XButtonEvent xbutton; XMotionEvent
xmotion; XCrossingEvent xcrossing; XFocusChangeEvent xfocus;
XExposeEvent xexpose; XGraphicsExposeEvent xgraphicsexpose;
XNoExposeEvent xnoexpose; XVisibilityEvent xvisibility;
XCreateWindowEvent xcreatewindow; XDestroyWindowEvent
xdestroywindow; XUnmapEvent xunmap; XMapEvent xmap;
XMapRequestEvent xmaprequest; XReparentEvent xreparent;
XConfigureEvent xconfigure; XGravityEvent xgravity;
XResizeRequestEvent xresizerequest; XConfigureRequestEvent
xconfigurerequest; XCirculateEvent xcirculate;
XCirculateRequestEvent xcirculaterequest; XPropertyEvent
xproperty; XSelectionClearEvent xselectionclear;
XSelectionRequestEvent xselectionrequest; XSelectionEvent
xselection; XColormapEvent xcolormap; XClientMessageEvent
xclient; XMappingEvent xmapping; XErrorEvent xerror;
XKeymapEvent xkeymap; long pad[24]; } XEvent;</p>

<p>An XEvent structure s first entry always is the type
member, which is set to the event type. The second member
always is the serial number of the protocol request that
generated the event. The third member always is send_event,
which is a Bool that indicates if the event was sent by a
different client. The fourth member always is a display,
which is the display that the event was read from. Except
for keymap events, the fifth member always is a window,
which has been carefully selected to be useful to toolkit
dispatchers. To avoid breaking toolk- its, the order of
these first five entries is not to change. Most events also
contain a time member, which is the time at which an event
occurred. In addition, a pointer to the generic event must
be cast before it is used to access any other information in
the structure.</p>
