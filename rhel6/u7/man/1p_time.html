<p>TIME(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TIME(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME time - time a simple command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS time [-p] utility [argument...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The time utility shall invoke the utility
named by the utility operand with arguments supplied as the
argument operands and write a message to standard error that
lists timing statistics for the utility. The mes- sage shall
include the following information:</p>

<p>* The elapsed (real) time between invocation of utility
and its termi- nation.</p>

<p>* The User CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the
tms_utime and tms_cutime fields returned by the times()
function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 for the process in which utility is
executed.</p>

<p>* The System CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the
tms_stime and tms_cstime fields returned by the times()
function for the process in which utility is executed.</p>

<p>The precision of the timing shall be no less than the
granularity defined for the size of the clock tick unit on
the system, but the results shall be reported in terms of
standard time units (for example, 0.02 seconds, 00:00:00.02,
1m33.75s, 365.21 seconds), not numbers of clock ticks.</p>

<p>When time is used as part of a pipeline, the times
reported are unspec- ified, except when it is the sole
command within a grouping command (see Grouping Commands )
in that pipeline. For example, the commands on the left are
unspecified; those on the right report on utilities a and c,
respectively:</p>

<p>time a | b | c { time a } | b | c a | b | time c a | b |
(time c)</p>

<p>OPTIONS The time utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-p Write the timing output to standard error in the
format shown in the STDERR section.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>utility The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If
the utility operand names any of the special built-in
utilities in Special Built-In Utilities, the results are
undefined.</p>

<p>argument Any string to be supplied as an argument when
invoking the util- ity named by the utility operand.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of time:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic and informative
messages written to standard error.</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC</p>

<p>Determine the locale for numeric formatting.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the search path that shall be used to
locate the util- ity to be invoked; see the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment
Variables.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used to write the
timing statistics. If -p is specified, the following format
shall be used in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p>&quot;real %nuser %nsys %n&quot;, &lt;real seconds&gt;,
&lt;user seconds&gt;, &lt;system seconds&gt;</p>

<p>where each floating-point number shall be expressed in
seconds. The precision used may be less than the default six
digits of %f, but shall be sufficiently precise to
accommodate the size of the clock tick on the system (for
example, if there were 60 clock ticks per second, at least
two digits shall follow the radix character). The number of
dig- its following the radix character shall be no less than
one, even if this always results in a trailing zero. The
implementation may append white space and additional
information following the format shown here.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If the utility utility is invoked, the exit
status of time shall be the exit status of utility;
otherwise, the time utility shall exit with one of the
following values:</p>

<p>1-125 An error occurred in the time utility.</p>

<p>126 The utility specified by utility was found but could
not be invoked.</p>

<p>127 The utility specified by utility could not be
found.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The command, env, nice, nohup, time,
and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit code 127
if an error occurs so that applications can distinguish
&quot;failure to find a utility&quot; from &quot;invoked
utility exited with an error indication&quot;. The value 127
was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
meanings; most utilities use small val- ues for &quot;normal
error conditions&quot; and the values above 128 can be con-
fused with termination due to receipt of a signal. The value
126 was chosen in a similar manner to indicate that the
utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts
produce meaningful error messages differ- entiating the 126
and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes 126 and
127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all
attempts to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses
126 when any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
reason.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES It is frequently desirable to apply time to
pipelines or lists of com- mands. This can be done by
placing pipelines and command lists in a single file; this
file can then be invoked as a utility, and the time applies
to everything in the file.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the following command can be used to
apply time to a complex command:</p>

<p>time sh -ccomplex-command-line</p>

<p>RATIONALE When the time utility was originally proposed
to be included in the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard, questions
were raised about its suitability for inclusion on the
grounds that it was not useful for conforming applications,
specifically:</p>

<p>* The underlying CPU definitions from the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 are vague, so the
numeric output could not be compared accurately between
systems or even between invocations.</p>

<p>* The creation of portable benchmark programs was
outside the scope this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>However, time does fit in the scope of user portability.
Human judge- ment can be applied to the analysis of the
output, and it could be very useful in hands-on debugging of
applications or in providing subjective measures of system
performance. Hence it has been included in this vol- ume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The default output format has been left unspecified
because historical implementations differ greatly in their
style of depicting this numeric output. The -p option was
invented to provide scripts with a common means of obtaining
this information.</p>

<p>In the KornShell, time is a shell reserved word that can
be used to time an entire pipeline, rather than just a
simple command. The POSIX definition has been worded to
allow this implementation. Consideration was given to
invalidating this approach because of the historical model
from the C shell and System V shell. However, since the
System V time utility historically has not produced accurate
results in pipeline tim- ing (because the constituent
processes are not all owned by the same parent process, as
allowed by POSIX), it did not seem worthwhile to break
historical KornShell usage.</p>

<p>The term utility is used, rather than command, to
highlight the fact that shell compound commands, pipelines,
special built-ins, and so on, cannot be used directly.
However, utility includes user application programs and
shell scripts, not just the standard utilities.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
