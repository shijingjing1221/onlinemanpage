<p>NAME sem_overview - Overview of POSIX semaphores</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION POSIX semaphores allow processes and threads
to synchronize their actions.</p>

<p>A semaphore is an integer whose value is never allowed
to fall below zero. Two operations can be performed on
semaphores: increment the semaphore value by one
(sem_post(3)); and decrement the semaphore value by one
(sem_wait(3)). If the value of a semaphore is currently
zero, then a sem_wait(3) operation will block until the
value becomes greater than zero.</p>

<p>POSIX semaphores come in two forms: named semaphores and
unnamed semaphores.</p>

<p>Named semaphores A named semaphore is identified by a
name of the form /somename; that is, a null-terminated
string of up to NAME_MAX-4 (i.e., 251) characters consisting
of an initial slash, followed by one or more characters,
none of which are slashes. Two processes can operate on the
same named semaphore by passing the same name to
sem_open(3).</p>

<p>The sem_open(3) function creates a new named semaphore
or opens an existing named semaphore. After the semaphore
has been opened, it can be operated on using sem_post(3) and
sem_wait(3). When a process has finished using the
semaphore, it can use sem_close(3) to close the semaphore.
When all processes have finished using the semaphore, it can
be removed from the system using sem_unlink(3).</p>

<p>Unnamed semaphores (memory-based semaphores) An unnamed
semaphore does not have a name. Instead the semaphore is
placed in a region of memory that is shared between multiple
threads (a thread-shared semaphore) or processes (a
process-shared semaphore). A thread-shared semaphore is
placed in an area of memory shared between by the threads of
a process, for example, a global variable. A process-shared
semaphore must be placed in a shared memory region (e.g., a
System V shared memory segment created using semget(2), or a
POSIX shared memory object built created using
shm_open(3)).</p>

<p>Before being used, an unnamed semaphore must be
initialized using sem_init(3). It can then be operated on
using sem_post(3) and sem_wait(3). When the semaphore is no
longer required, and before the memory in which it is
located is deallocated, the semaphore should be destroyed
using sem_destroy(3).</p>

<p>The remainder of this section describes some specific
details of the Linux implementation of POSIX semaphores.</p>

<p>Versions Prior to kernel 2.6, Linux only supported
unnamed, thread-shared semaphores. On a system with Linux
2.6 and a glibc that provides the NPTL threading
implementation, a complete implementation of POSIX
semaphores is provided.</p>

<p>Persistence POSIX named semaphores have kernel
persistence: if not removed by sem_unlink(3), a semaphore
will exist until the system is shut down.</p>

<p>Linking Programs using the POSIX semaphores API must be
compiled with cc -lrt to link against the real-time library,
librt.</p>

<p>Accessing named semaphores via the file system On Linux,
named semaphores are created in a virtual file system, nor-
mally mounted under /dev/shm, with names of the form
sem.somename. (This is the reason that semaphore names are
limited to NAME_MAX-4 rather than NAME_MAX characters.)</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.19, ACLs can be placed on files under
this directory, to control object permissions on a per-user
and per-group basis.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES System V semaphores (semget(2), semop(2), etc.)
are an older semaphore API. POSIX semaphores provide a
simpler, and better designed interface than System V
semaphores; on the other hand POSIX semaphores are less
widely available (especially on older systems) than System V
semaphores.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE An example of the use of various POSIX semaphore
functions is shown in sem_wait(3).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO sem_close(3), sem_destroy(3), sem_getvalue(3),
sem_init(3), sem_open(3), sem_post(3), sem_unlink(3),
sem_wait(3), pthreads(7)</p>
