<p>NAME XFocusChangeEvent - FocusIn and FocusOut event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The structure for FocusIn and FocusOut events
contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int type; /* FocusIn or FocusOut */
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a
SendEvent request */ Display *display; /* Display the event
was read from */ Window window; /* window of event */ int
mode; /* NotifyNormal, NotifyGrab, NotifyUngrab */ int
detail; /* * NotifyAncestor, NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior,
* NotifyNonlinear,NotifyNonlinearVirtual, NotifyPointer, *
NotifyPointerRoot, NotifyDetailNone */ } XFocusChangeEvent;
typedef XFocusChangeEvent XFocusInEvent; typedef
XFocusChangeEvent XFocusOutEvent;</p>

<p>When you receive these events, the structure members are
set as fol- lows.</p>

<p>The type member is set to the event type constant name
that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server
reports a GraphicsExpose event to a client application, it
sends an XGraphicsExposeEvent struc- ture with the type
member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event
member is set to True if the event came from a SendEvent
protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial
number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit
least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.</p>

<p>The window member is set to the window on which the
FocusIn or FocusOut event was generated. This is the window
used by the X server to report the event. The mode member is
set to indicate whether the focus events are normal focus
events, focus events while grabbed, focus events when a grab
activates, or focus events when a grab deactivates. The X
server can set the mode member to NotifyNormal,
NotifyWhileGrabbed, NotifyGrab, or NotifyUngrab.</p>

<p>All FocusOut events caused by a window unmap are
generated after any UnmapNotify event; however, the X
protocol does not constrain the ordering of FocusOut events
with respect to generated EnterNotify, LeaveNotify,
VisibilityNotify, and Expose events.</p>

<p>Depending on the event mode, the detail member is set to
indicate the notify detail and can be NotifyAncestor,
NotifyVirtual, NotifyInferior, NotifyNonlinear,
NotifyNonlinearVirtual, NotifyPointer, NotifyPointer- Root,
or NotifyDetailNone.</p>
