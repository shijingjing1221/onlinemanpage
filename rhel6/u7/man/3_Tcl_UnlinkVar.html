<p>Tcl_LinkVar(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_LinkVar(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_LinkVar, Tcl_UnlinkVar, Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar -
link Tcl variable to C variable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_LinkVar(interp, varName, addr, type)</p>

<p>Tcl_UnlinkVar(interp, varName)</p>

<p>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar(interp, varName)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter that
contains varName. Also used by Tcl_LinkVar to return error
messages.</p>

<p>const char *varName (in) Name of global variable.</p>

<p>char *addr (in) Address of C variable that is to be
linked to varName.</p>

<p>int type (in) Type of C variable. Must be one of
TCL_LINK_INT, TCL_LINK_UINT, TCL_LINK_CHAR, TCL_LINK_UCHAR,
TCL_LINK_SHORT, TCL_LINK_USHORT, TCL_LINK_LONG,
TCL_LINK_ULONG, TCL_LINK_WIDE_INT, TCL_LINK_WIDE_UINT,
TCL_LINK_FLOAT, TCL_LINK_DOUBLE, TCL_LINK_BOOLEAN, or
TCL_LINK_STRING, optionally ORed with TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY to
make Tcl variable read-only.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_LinkVar uses variable traces to keep the
Tcl variable named by var- Name in sync with the C variable
at the address given by addr. When- ever the Tcl variable is
read the value of the C variable will be returned, and
whenever the Tcl variable is written the C variable will be
updated to have the same value. Tcl_LinkVar normally returns
TCL_OK; if an error occurs while setting up the link (e.g.
because varName is the name of array) then TCL_ERROR is
returned and the inter- preters result contains an error
message.</p>

<p>The type argument specifies the type of the C variable,
and must have one of the following values, optionally OR ed
with TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY:</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_INT The C variable is of type int. Any value
written into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer
form acceptable to Tcl_Get- IntFromObj; attempts to write
non-integer values into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_UINT The C variable is of type unsigned int.
Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
unsigned integer form acceptable to Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj
and in the platforms defined range for the unsigned int
type; attempts to write non- integer values (or values
outside the range) into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_CHAR The C variable is of type char. Any value
written into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer
form acceptable to Tcl_Get- IntFromObj and be in the range
of the char datatype; attempts to write non-integer or
out-of-range values into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_UCHAR The C variable is of type unsigned char.
Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
unsigned integer form acceptable to Tcl_GetIntFromObj and in
the platforms defined range for the unsigned char type;
attempts to write non-integer values (or values outside the
range) into varName will be rejected with Tcl errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_SHORT The C variable is of type short. Any
value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
integer form acceptable to Tcl_Get- IntFromObj and be in the
range of the short datatype; attempts to write non-integer
or out-of-range values into varName will be rejected with
Tcl errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_USHORT The C variable is of type unsigned
short. Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a
proper unsigned integer form acceptable to Tcl_GetIntFromObj
and in the platforms defined range for the unsigned short
type; attempts to write non-integer values (or values
outside the range) into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_LONG The C variable is of type long. Any value
written into the Tcl variable must have a proper integer
form acceptable to Tcl_Get- LongFromObj; attempts to write
non-integer or out-of-range val- ues into varName will be
rejected with Tcl errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_ULONG The C variable is of type unsigned long.
Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
unsigned integer form acceptable to Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj
and in the platforms defined range for the unsigned long
type; attempts to write non- integer values (or values
outside the range) into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_DOUBLE The C variable is of type double. Any
value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper real
form acceptable to Tcl_Get- DoubleFromObj; attempts to write
non-real values into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_FLOAT The C variable is of type float. Any
value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper real
form acceptable to Tcl_GetDou- bleFromObj and must be within
the range acceptable for a float; attempts to write non-real
values (or values outside the range) into varName will be
rejected with Tcl errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_WIDE_INT The C variable is of type Tcl_WideInt
(which is an integer type at least 64-bits wide on all
platforms that can support it.) Any value written into the
Tcl variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to
Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj; attempts to write non-integer values
into varName will be rejected with Tcl errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_WIDE_UINT The C variable is of type
Tcl_WideUInt (which is an unsigned integer type at least
64-bits wide on all platforms that can support it.) Any
value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper
unsigned integer form acceptable to Tcl_GetWideIntFro- mObj
(it will be cast to unsigned); attempts to write non-inte-
ger values into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_BOOLEAN The C variable is of type int. If its
value is zero then it will read from Tcl as 0; otherwise it
will read from Tcl as 1 . Whenever varName is modified, the
C variable will be set to a 0 or 1 value. Any value written
into the Tcl variable must have a proper boolean form
acceptable to Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj; attempts to write
non-boolean values into varName will be rejected with Tcl
errors.</p>

<p>TCL_LINK_STRING The C variable is of type char *. If its
value is not NULL then it must be a pointer to a string
allocated with Tcl_Alloc or ckalloc. Whenever the Tcl
variable is modified the current C string will be freed and
new memory will be allocated to hold a copy of the variable
s new value. If the C variable contains a NULL pointer then
the Tcl variable will read as NULL.</p>

<p>If the TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY flag is present in type then
the variable will be read-only from Tcl, so that its value
can only be changed by modifying the C variable. Attempts to
write the variable from Tcl will be rejected with
errors.</p>

<p>Tcl_UnlinkVar removes the link previously set up for the
variable given by varName. If there does not exist a link
for varName then the proce- dure has no effect.</p>

<p>Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar may be invoked after the C variable
has changed to force the Tcl variable to be updated
immediately. In many cases this procedure is not needed,
since any attempt to read the Tcl variable will return the
latest value of the C variable. However, if a trace has been
set on the Tcl variable (such as a Tk widget that wishes to
display the value of the variable), the trace will not
trigger when the C variable has changed. Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar
ensures that any traces on the Tcl variable are invoked.</p>
