<p>NAME XmTextCopy A Text function that copies the primary
selection to the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Text.h&gt; Boolean XmTextCopy(
Widget widget, Time time);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextCopy copies the primary selected text
to the clipboard.</p>

<p>This routine calls the XmNconvertCallback procedures,
possibly multiple times, with the selection member of the
XmConvertCallbackStruct set to CLIPBOARD and with the parm
member set to XmCOPY.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the Text widget ID.</p>

<p>time Specifies the server time at which the selection
value is to be modified. This should be the time of the
event which trig- gered this request. One source of a valid
time stamp is the function XtLastTimestampProcessed().</p>

<p>For a complete definition of Text and its associated
resources, see XmText(3).</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns False if the primary
selection is NULL, if the widget does not own the primary
selection, if the function is unable to gain ownership of
the clipboard selection, or if no data is placed on the
clipboard. Otherwise, it returns True.</p>
