<p>GETWD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETWD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getwd - get the current working directory pathname
(LEGACY)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *getwd(char *path_name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getwd() function shall determine an
absolute pathname of the cur- rent working directory of the
calling process, and copy a string con- taining that
pathname into the array pointed to by the path_name argu-
ment.</p>

<p>If the length of the pathname of the current working
directory is greater than ({PATH_MAX}+1) including the null
byte, getwd() shall fail and return a null pointer.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, a pointer to
the string containing the absolute pathname of the current
working directory shall be returned. Otherwise, getwd()
shall return a null pointer and the contents of the array
pointed to by path_name are undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE For applications portability, the
getcwd() function should be used to determine the current
working directory instead of getwd().</p>

<p>RATIONALE Since the user cannot specify the length of
the buffer passed to getwd(), use of this function is
discouraged. The length of a pathname described in
{PATH_MAX} is file system-dependent and may vary from one
mount point to another, or might even be unlimited. It is
possible to overflow this buffer in such a way as to cause
applications to fail, or possible system security
violations.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the getcwd() function should be
used to deter- mine the current working directory.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS This function may be withdrawn in a
future version.</p>
