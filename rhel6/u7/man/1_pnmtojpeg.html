<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtojpeg converts the named PBM, PGM, or PPM image
file, or the stan- dard input if no file is named, to a JFIF
file on the standard output.</p>

<p>pnmtojpeg uses the Independent JPEG Groups JPEG library
to create the output file. See http://www.ijg.org for
information on the library.</p>

<p>JFIF is the correct name for the image format commonly
known as JPEG. Strictly speaking, JPEG is a method of
compression. The image format using JPEG compression that is
by far the most common is JFIF. There is also a subformat of
TIFF that uses JPEG compression.</p>

<p>EXIF is an image format that is a subformat of JFIF (to
wit, a JFIF file that contains an EXIF header as an APP1
marker). pnmtojpeg cre- ates an EXIF image when you specify
the -exif option.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The basic options are:</p>

<p>-exif=filespec This option specifies that the output
image is to be EXIF (a subformat of JFIF), i.e. it will have
an EXIF header as a JFIF APP1 marker. The contents of that
marker are the contents of the specified file. The special
value - means to read the EXIF header contents from standard
input. It is invalid to specify standard input for both the
EXIF header and the input image.</p>

<p>The EXIF file starts with a two byte field which is the
length of the file, including the length field, in pure
binary, most significant byte first. The special value of
zero for the length field means there is to be no EXIF
header, i.e. the same as no -exif option. This is useful for
when you convert a file from JFIF to PNM using jpegtopnm,
then transform it, then con- vert it back to JFIF with
pnmtojpeg, and you don t know whether or not it includes an
EXIF header. jpegtopnm creates an EXIF file containing
nothing but two bytes of zero when the input JFIF file has
no EXIF header. Thus, you can transfer any EXIF header from
the input JFIF to the output JFIF without worrying about
whether an EXIF header actually exists.</p>

<p>The contents of the EXIF file after the length field are
the exact byte for byte contents of the APP1 marker, not
counting the length field, that constitutes the EXIF
header.</p>

<p>-quality=n Scale quantization tables to adjust image
quality. n is 0 (worst) to 100 (best); default is 75. Below
about 25 can pro- duce images some interpreters won t be
able to interpret. See below for more info.</p>

<p>-grayscale</p>

<p>-greyscale</p>

<p>-rgb These options determine the color space used in the
JFIF output. -grayscale (or -greyscale) means to create a
gray scale JFIF, converting from color PPM input if
necessary. -rgb means to create an RGB JFIF, and the program
fails if the input is not PPM.</p>

<p>If you specify neither, The output file is in YCbCr
format if the input is PPM, and grayscale format if the
input is PBM or PGM.</p>

<p>YCbCr format (a color is represented by an intensity
value and two chrominance values) usually compresses much
better than RGB (a color is represented by one red, one
green, and one blue value). RGB is rare. But you may be able
to convert between JFIF and PPM faster with RGB, since its
the same color space PPM uses.</p>

<p>The testimg.ppm file that comes with Netpbm is 2.3 times
larger with the -rgb option than with the YCbCr default, and
in one experiment pnmtojpeg took 16% more CPU time to
convert it. The extra CPU time probably indicates that
processing of all the extra compressed data consumed all the
CPU time saved by not having to convert the RGB inputs to
YCbCr.</p>

<p>Grayscale format takes up a lot less space and takes
less time to create and process than the color formats, even
if the image contains nothing but black, white, and
gray.</p>

<p>The -rgb option was added in Netpbm 10.11 in October
2002.</p>

<p>-density=density This option determines the density (aka
resolution) information recorded in the JFIF output image.
It does not affect the raster in any way; it just tells
whoever reads the JFIF how to interpret the raster.</p>

<p>The density value takes the form xxy followed by an
optional unit specifier of dpi or dpcm. Examples: 1x1, 3x2,
300x300dpi, 100x200dpcm. The first number is the horizontal
density; the 2nd number is the vertical density. Each may be
any integer from 1 to 65535. The unit specifier is dpi for
dots per inch or dpcm for dots per centimeter. If you don t
specify the units, the density information goes into the
JFIF explicitly stating &quot;density unspecified&quot;
(also interpreted as &quot;unknown&quot;). This may seem
pointless, but note that even without specifying the units,
the density numbers tell the aspect ratio of the pixels.
E.g. 1x1 tells you the pixels are square. 3x2 tells you the
pixels are vertical rectangles.</p>

<p>Note that if you specify different horizontal and
vertical den- sities, the resulting JFIF image is not a true
representation of the input PNM image, because pnmtojpeg
converts the raster pixel-for-pixel and the pixels of a PNM
image are defined to be square. Thus, if you start with a
square PNM image and specify -density=3x2, the resulting
JFIF image is a horizontally squashed version of the
original. However, it is common to use an input image which
is a slight variation on PNM rather than true PNM such that
the pixels are not square. In that case, the appropriate
-density option yields a faithful reproduction of the input
pseudo-PNM image.</p>

<p>The default is 1x1 in unspecified units.</p>

<p>Before Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), this option did not
exist and the pnmtojpeg always created a JFIF with a density
of 1x1 in unspecified units.</p>

<p>-optimize Perform optimization of entropy encoding
parameters. Without this, pnmtojpeg uses default encoding
parameters. -optimize usually makes the JFIF file a little
smaller, but pnmtojpeg runs somewhat slower and needs much
more memory. Image quality and speed of decompression are
unaffected by -optimize.</p>

<p>-progressive Create a progressive JPEG file (see
below).</p>

<p>-comment=text Include a comment marker in the JFIF
output, with comment text text.</p>

<p>Without this option, there are no comment markers in the
output.</p>

<p>The -quality option lets you trade off compressed file
size against quality of the reconstructed image: the higher
the quality setting, the larger the JFIF file, and the
closer the output image will be to the original input.
Normally you want to use the lowest quality setting
(smallest file) that decompresses into something visually
indistin- guishable from the original image. For this
purpose the quality set- ting should be between 50 and 95
for reasonable results; the default of 75 is often about
right. If you see defects at -quality=75, then go up 5 or 10
counts at a time until you are happy with the output image.
(The optimal setting will vary from one image to
another.)</p>

<p>-quality=100 generates a quantization table of all 1s,
minimizing loss in the quantization step (but there is still
information loss in sub- sampling, as well as roundoff
error). This setting is mainly of inter- est for
experimental purposes. Quality values above about 95 are not
recommended for normal use; the compressed file size goes up
dramati- cally for hardly any gain in output image
quality.</p>

<p>In the other direction, quality values below 50 will
produce very small files of low image quality. Settings
around 5 to 10 might be useful in preparing an index of a
large image library, for example. Try -qual- ity=2 (or so)
for some amusing Cubist effects. (Note: quality values below
about 25 generate 2-byte quantization tables, which are
consid- ered optional in the JFIF standard. pnmtojpeg emits
a warning message when you give such a quality value,
because some other JFIF programs may be unable to decode the
resulting file. Use -baseline if you need to ensure
compatibility at low quality values.)</p>

<p>The -progressive option creates a progressive JPEG file.
In this type of JFIF file, the data is stored in multiple
scans of increasing quality. If the file is being
transmitted over a slow communications link, the decoder can
use the first scan to display a low-quality image very
quickly, and can then improve the display with each
subsequent scan. The final image is exactly equivalent to a
standard JFIF file of the same quality setting, and the
total file size is about the same -- often a little
smaller.</p>

<p>Caution: progressive JPEG is not yet widely implemented,
so many decoders will be unable to view a progressive JPEG
file at all.</p>

<p>If you re trying to control the quality/file size
tradeoff, you might consider the JPEG2000 format instead.
See pamtojpeg2k(1).</p>

<p>Options for advanced users:</p>

<p>-dct=int Use integer DCT method (default).</p>

<p>-dct=fast Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).</p>

<p>-dct=float Use floating-point DCT method. The float
method is very slightly more accurate than the int method,
but is much slower unless your machine has very fast
floating-point hardware. Also note that results of the
floating-point method may vary slightly across machines,
while the integer methods should give the same results
everywhere. The fast integer method is much less accu- rate
than the other two.</p>

<p>-arithmetic Use arithmetic coding. Default is Huffman
encoding. Arithmetic coding tends to get you a smaller
result.</p>

<p>You may need patent licenses to use this option.
According to the JPEG FAQ , This method is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.</p>

<p>The author of the FAQ recommends against using
arithmetic coding (and therefore this option) because the
space savings is not great enough to justify the legal
hassles.</p>

<p>Most JPEG libraries, including any distributed by the
Indepen- dent JPEG Group since about 1998 are not capable of
arithmetic encoding. pnmtojpeg uses a JPEG library (either
bound to it when the pnmtojpeg executable was built or
accessed on your sys- tem at run time) to do the JPEG
encoding. If pnmtojpeg termi- nates with the message, Sorry,
there are legal restrictions on arithmetic coding or Sorry,
arithmetic coding not supported, this is the problem.</p>

<p>-restart=n Emit a JPEG restart marker every n MCU rows,
or every n MCU blocks if you append B to the number.
-restart 0 (the default) means no restart markers.</p>

<p>-smooth=n Smooth the input image to eliminate dithering
noise. n, ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the strength of
smoothing. 0 (the default) means no smoothing.</p>

<p>-maxmemory=n Set a limit for amount of memory to use in
processing large images. Value is in thousands of bytes, or
millions of bytes if you append M to the number. For
example, -max=4m selects 4,000,000 bytes. If pnmtojpeg needs
more space, it will use temporary files.</p>

<p>-verbose Print to the Standard Error file messages about
the conversion process. This can be helpful in debugging
problems.</p>

<p>The -restart option tells pnmtojpeg to insert extra
markers that allow a JPEG decoder to resynchronize after a
transmission error. Without restart markers, any damage to a
compressed file will usually ruin the image from the point
of the error to the end of the image; with restart markers,
the damage is usually confined to the portion of the image
up to the next restart marker. Of course, the restart
markers occupy extra space. We recommend -restart=1 for
images that will be transmit- ted across unreliable networks
such as Usenet.</p>

<p>The -smooth option filters the input to eliminate
fine-scale noise. This is often useful when converting
dithered images to JFIF: a moder- ate smoothing factor of 10
to 50 gets rid of dithering patterns in the input file,
resulting in a smaller JFIF file and a better-looking image.
Too large a smoothing factor will visibly blur the image,
how- ever.</p>

<p>Options for wizards:</p>

<p>-baseline Force baseline-compatible quantization tables
to be generated. This clamps quantization values to 8 bits
even at low quality settings. (This switch is poorly named,
since it does not ensure that the output is actually
baseline JPEG. For example, you can use -baseline and
-progressive together.)</p>

<p>-qtables=filespec Use the quantization tables given in
the specified text file.</p>

<p>-qslots=n[,...] Select which quantization table to use
for each color component.</p>

<p>-sample=HxV[,...] Set JPEG sampling factors for each
color component.</p>

<p>-scans=filespec Use the scan script given in the
specified text file. See below for information on scan
scripts.</p>

<p>-tracelevel=N This sets the level of debug tracing the
program outputs as it runs. 0 means none, and is the
default. This level primarily controls tracing of the JPEG
library, and you can get some pretty interesting information
about the compression process.</p>

<p>The wizard options are intended for experimentation with
JPEG. If you dont know what you are doing, dot use them.
These switches are documented further in the file wizard.doc
that comes with the Indepen- dent JPEG Groups JPEG
library.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example compresses the PPM file foo.ppm
with a quality factor of 60 and saves the output as
foo.jpg:</p>

<p>pnmtojpeg -quality=60 foo.ppm &gt; foo.jpg</p>

<p>Here s a more typical example. It converts from BMP to
JFIF:</p>

<p>cat foo.bmp | bmptoppm | pnmtojpeg &gt; foo.jpg</p>

<p>JPEG Loss When you compress with JPEG, you lose
information -- i.e. the resulting image has somewhat lower
quality than the original. This is a charac- teristic of
JPEG itself, not any particular program. So if you do the
usual Netpbm thing and convert from JFIF to PNM, manipulate,
then con- vert back to JFIF, you will lose quality. The more
you do it, the more you lose. Drawings (charts, cartoons,
line drawings, and such with few colors and sharp edges)
suffer the most.</p>

<p>To avoid this, you can use a compressed image format
other than JPEG. PNG and JPEG2000 are good choices, and
Netpbm contains converters for those.</p>

<p>If you need to use JFIF on a drawing, you should
experiment with pnmto- jpegs -quality and -smooth options to
get a satisfactory conversion. -smooth 10 or so is often
helpful.</p>

<p>Because of the loss, you should do all the manipulation
you have to do on the image in some other format and convert
to JFIF as the last step. And if you can keep a copy in the
original format, so much the better.</p>

<p>The -optimize option to pnmtojpeg is worth using when
you are making a final version for posting or archiving. Its
also a win when you are using low quality settings to make
very small JFIF files; the percent- age improvement is often
a lot more than it is on larger files. (At present,
-optimize mode is automatically in effect when you generate
a progressive JPEG file).</p>

<p>You can do flipping and rotating transformations
losslessly with the program jpegtran, which is packaged with
the Independent Jpeg Groups JPEG library. jpegtran exercises
its intimate knowledge of the way JPEG works to do the
transformation without ever actually decompressing the
image.</p>

<p>Another program, cjpeg, is similar. cjpeg is maintained
by the Independent JPEG Group and packaged with the JPEG
library which pnmtojpeg uses for all its JPEG work. Because
of that, you may expect it to exploit more current JPEG
features. Also, since you have to have the library to run
pnmtojpeg, but not vice versa, cjpeg may be more commonly
available.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cjpeg does not use the NetPBM
libraries to process its input, as all the NetPBM tools such
as pnmtojpeg do. This means it is less likely to be
consistent with all the other programs that deal with the
NetPBM formats. Also, the command syntax of pnmtojpeg is
con- sistent with that of the other Netpbm tools, unlike
cjpeg.</p>

<p>SCAN SCRIPTS Use the -scan option to specify a scan
script. Or use the -progressive option to specify a
particular built-in scan script.</p>

<p>Just what a scan script is, and the basic format of the
scan script file, is covered in the wizard.doc file that
comes with the Independent JPEG Groups JPEG library. Scan
scripts are same for pnmtojpeg as the are for cjpeg.</p>

<p>This section contains additional information that isnt,
but probably should be, in that document.</p>

<p>First, there are many restrictions on what is a valid
scan script. The JPEG library, and thus pnmtojpeg, checks
thoroughly for any lack of compliance with these
restrictions, but does little to tell you how the script
fails to comply. The messages are very general and sometimes
untrue.</p>

<p>To start with, the entries for the DC coefficient must
come before any entries for the AC coefficients. The DC
coefficient is Coefficient 0; all the other coefficients are
AC coefficients. So in an entry for the DC coefficient, the
two numbers after the colon must be 0 and 0. In an entry for
AC coefficients, the first number after the colon must not
be 0.</p>

<p>In a DC entry, the color components must be in
increasing order. E.g. 0,2,1 before the colon is wrong. So
is 0,0,0.</p>

<p>In an entry for an AC coeffient, you must specify only
one color compo- nent. I.e. there can be only one number
before the colon.</p>

<p>In the first entry for a particular coefficient for a
particular color component, the Ah value must be zero, but
the Al value can be any valid bit number. In subsequent
entries, Ah must be the Al value from the previous entry
(for that coefficient for that color component), and the Al
value must be one less than the Ah value.</p>

<p>The script must ultimately specify at least some of the
DC coefficent for every color component. Otherwise, you get
the error message Script does not transmit all the data. You
need not specify all of the bits of the DC coefficient, or
any of the AC coefficients.</p>

<p>There is a standard option in building the JPEG library
to omit scan script capability. If for some reason your
library was built with this option, you get the message
Requested feature was omitted at compile time.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT JPEGMEM If this environment variable is set,
its value is the default memory limit. The value is
specified as described for the -maxmemory option. An
explicit -maxmemory option overrides any JPEGMEM.</p>
