<p>NAME gftodvi - make proof sheets from generic font
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gftodvi [ -overflow-label-offset=real ] [
-verbose ] [ gf_file_name ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The gftodvi program converts a generic font (gf) file
output by, for example, mf(1), to a device independent (DVI)
file (that can then be typeset using the same software that
has already been written for TeX). The characters in the gf
file will appear one per page, with labels, titles, and
annotations as specified in Appendix H (Hardcopy Proofs) of
The Metafontbook.</p>

<p>gftodvi uses other fonts in addition to the main gf
file. A gray font is used to typeset the pixels that
actually make up the character. (We wouldnt want all the
pixels to be simply black, since then labels, key points,
and other information would be lost.) A title font is used
for the information at the top of the page. A label font is
used for the labels on key points of the figure. A slant
font is used to typeset diagonal lines, which otherwise have
to be simulated using hor- izontal and vertical rules. The
default gray, title, and label fonts are gray, cmr8, and
cmtt10, respectively; there is no default slant font.</p>

<p>To change the default fonts, you can give special
commands in your Metafont source file, or you can change the
fonts online. An online dialog ensues if you end the
gf_file_name with a /. For example, gftodvi cmr10.300gf/
Special font substitution: grayfont black OK; any more?
grayfontarea /home/art/don/ OK; any more? slantfont
/home/fonts/slantimagen6 OK; any more? &lt;RET&gt; will use
/home/art/don/black as the gray font and /home/fonts/slan-
timagen6 as the slant font (this name indicates a font for
lines with slope 1/6 at the resolution of an Imagen
printer).</p>

<p>The gf_file_name on the command line must be complete.
(The program prompts you for it if you dont give it.)
Because the resolution is part of the extension, it would
not make sense to append a default extension as is done with
TeX or DVI-reading software. The output file name defaults
to the same root as the gf file, with the dvi extension
added. For example, the input file cmr10.2602gf would become
cmr10.dvi.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The argument to -overflow-label-offset specifies
the distance from the right edge of the character bounding
box at which the overflow equa- tions (if any) are typeset.
The value is given in TeX points. The default is a little
over two inches.</p>

<p>Without the -verbose option, gftodvi operates silently.
With it, a banner and progress report are printed on
stdout.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT gftodvi looks for gf_file_name using the
environment variable GFFONTS. If that is not set, it uses
the variable TEXFONTS. If that is not set, it uses the
system default.</p>

<p>See tex(1) for the details of the searching.</p>
