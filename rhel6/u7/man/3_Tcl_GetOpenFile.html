Tcl_GetOpenFile(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_GetOpenFile - Return a FILE* for a channel
registered in the given interpreter (Unix only)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int Tcl_GetOpenFile(interp, chanID, write, checkUsage,
filePtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Tcl interpreter from
which file handle is to be obtained.</p>

<p>const char *chanID (in) String identifying channel, such
as stdin or file4.</p>

<p>int write (in) Non-zero means the file will be used for
writing, zero means it will be used for reading.</p>

<p>int checkUsage (in) If non-zero, then an error will be
generated if the file was not opened for the access
indicated by write.</p>

<p>ClientData *filePtr (out) Points to word in which to
store pointer to FILE structure for the file given by
chanID.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_GetOpenFile takes as argument a file
identifier of the form returned by the open command and
returns at *filePtr a pointer to the FILE structure for the
file. The write argument indicates whether the FILE pointer
will be used for reading or writing. In some cases, such as
a channel that connects to a pipeline of subprocesses,
different FILE pointers will be returned for reading and
writing. Tcl_GetOpen- File normally returns TCL_OK. If an
error occurs in Tcl_GetOpenFile (e.g. chanID did not make
any sense or checkUsage was set and the file was not opened
for the access specified by write) then TCL_ERROR is
returned and the interpreter s result will contain an error
message. In the current implementation checkUsage is ignored
and consistency checks are always performed.</p>

<p>Note that this interface is only supported on the Unix
platform.</p>
