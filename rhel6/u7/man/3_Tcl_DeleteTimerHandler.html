<p>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_CreateTimerHandler(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_CreateTimerHandler, Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler -
call a procedure at a given time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_TimerToken Tcl_CreateTimerHandler(milliseconds,
proc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler(token)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int milliseconds (in) How many milliseconds to
wait before invoking proc.</p>

<p>Tcl_TimerProc *proc (in) Procedure to invoke after
milliseconds have elapsed.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value to
pass to proc.</p>

<p>Tcl_TimerToken token (in) Token for previously created
timer handler (the return value from some previous call to
Tcl_CreateTimerHandler).
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_CreateTimerHandler arranges for proc to
be invoked at a time mil- liseconds milliseconds in the
future. The callback to proc will be made by Tcl_DoOneEvent,
so Tcl_CreateTimerHandler is only useful in programs that
dispatch events through Tcl_DoOneEvent or through Tcl
commands such as vwait. The call to proc may not be made at
the exact time given by milliseconds: it will be made at the
next opportunity after that time. For example, if
Tcl_DoOneEvent is not called until long after the time has
elapsed, or if there are other pending events to process
before the call to proc, then the call to proc will be
delayed.</p>

<p>Proc should have arguments and return value that match
the type Tcl_TimerProc: typedef void
Tcl_TimerProc(ClientData clientData); The clientData
parameter to proc is a copy of the clientData argument given
to Tcl_CreateTimerHandler when the callback was created.
Typi- cally, clientData points to a data structure
containing application- specific information about what to
do in proc.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler may be called to delete a
previously created timer handler. It deletes the handler
indicated by token so that no call to proc will be made; if
that handler no longer exists (e.g. because the time period
has already elapsed and proc has been invoked then
Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler does nothing. The tokens returned by
Tcl_CreateTimerHandler never have a value of NULL, so if
NULL is passed to Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler then the procedure
does nothing.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS callback, clock, handler, timer</p>
