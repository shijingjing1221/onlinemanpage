<p>ENUM IEEE80211_CONF_(9) The basic mac80211 driver inte
ENUM IEEE80211_CONF_(9)</p>

<p>NAME enum_ieee80211_conf_flags - configuration flags</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS enum ieee80211_conf_flags {
IEEE80211_CONF_MONITOR, IEEE80211_CONF_PS,
IEEE80211_CONF_IDLE, IEEE80211_CONF_OFFCHANNEL };</p>

<p>CONSTANTS IEEE80211_CONF_MONITOR there&acute;s a monitor
interface present -- use this to determine for example
whether to calculate timestamps for packets or not, do not
use instead of filter flags!</p>

<p>IEEE80211_CONF_PS Enable 802.11 power save mode (managed
mode only). This is the power save mode defined by IEEE
802.11-2007 section 11.2, meaning that the hardware still
wakes up for beacons, is able to transmit frames and receive
the possible acknowledgment frames. Not to be confused with
hardware specific wakeup/sleep states, driver is responsible
for that. See the section Powersave support for more.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_CONF_IDLE The device is running, but idle; if
the flag is set the driver should be prepared to handle
configuration requests but may turn the device off as much
as possible. Typically, this flag will be set when an
interface is set UP but not associated or scanning, but it
can also be unset in that case when monitor interfaces are
active.</p>

<p>IEEE80211_CONF_OFFCHANNEL The device is currently not on
its main operating channel.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Flags to define PHY configuration
options</p>
