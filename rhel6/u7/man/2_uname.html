<p>NAME uname - get name and information about current
kernel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;</p>

<p>int uname(struct utsname *buf);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION uname() returns system information in the
structure pointed to by buf. The utsname struct is defined
in &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;:</p>

<p>struct utsname { char sysname[]; /* Operating system
name (e.g., &quot;Linux&quot;) */ char nodename[]; /* Name
within &quot;some implementation-defined network&quot; */
char release[]; /* OS release (e.g., &quot;2.6.28&quot;) */
char version[]; /* OS version */ char machine[]; /* Hardware
identifier */ #ifdef _GNU_SOURCE char domainname[]; /* NIS
or YP domain name */ #endif };</p>

<p>The length of the arrays in a struct utsname is
unspecified (see NOTES); the fields are terminated by a null
byte (&rsquo; &rsquo;).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT buf is not valid.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, POSIX.1-2001. There is no uname()
call in 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>The domainname member (the NIS or YP domain name) is a
GNU extension.</p>

<p>NOTES This is a system call, and the operating system
presumably knows its name, release and version. It also
knows what hardware it runs on. So, four of the fields of
the struct are meaningful. On the other hand, the field
nodename is meaningless: it gives the name of the present
machine in some undefined network, but typically machines
are in more than one network and have several names.
Moreover, the kernel has no way of knowing about such
things, so it has to be told what to answer here. The same
holds for the additional domainname field.</p>

<p>To this end Linux uses the system calls sethostname(2)
and setdomain- name(2). Note that there is no standard that
says that the hostname set by sethostname(2) is the same
string as the nodename field of the struct returned by
uname() (indeed, some systems allow a 256-byte host- name
and an 8-byte nodename), but this is true on Linux. The same
holds for setdomainname(2) and the domainname field.</p>

<p>The length of the fields in the struct varies. Some
operating systems or libraries use a hardcoded 9 or 33 or 65
or 257. Other systems use SYS_NMLN or _SYS_NMLN or UTSLEN or
_UTSNAME_LENGTH. Clearly, it is a bad idea to use any of
these constants; just use sizeof(...). Often 257 is chosen
in order to have room for an internet hostname.</p>

<p>Part of the utsname information is also accessible via
/proc/sys/ker- nel/{ostype, hostname, osrelease, version,
domainname}.</p>

<p>Underlying kernel interface Over time, increases in the
size of the utsname structure have led to three successive
versions of uname(): sys_olduname() (slot __NR_oldolduname),
sys_uname() (slot __NR_olduname), and sys_newuname() (slot
__NR_uname). The first one used length 9 for all fields; the
second used 65; the third also uses 65 but adds the
domainname field. The glibc uname() wrapper function hides
these details from applica- tions, invoking the most recent
version of the system call provided by the kernel.</p>
