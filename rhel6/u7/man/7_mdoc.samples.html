<p>MDOC.SAMPLES(7) BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual
MDOC.SAMPLES(7)</p>

<p>NAME mdoc.samples - tutorial sampler for writing BSD
manuals with -mdoc</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS man mdoc.samples</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A tutorial sampler for writing BSD manual
pages with the -mdoc macro package, a content-based and
domain-based formatting package for troff(1). Its
predecessor, the -man(7) package, addressed page layout
leaving the manipulation of fonts and other typesetting
details to the individual author. In -mdoc, page layout
macros make up the page structure domain which consists of
macros for titles, section headers, displays and lists.
Essentially items which affect the physical position of text
on a formatted page. In addition to the page structure
domain, there are two more domains, the manual domain and
the general text domain. The general text domain is defined
as macros which perform tasks such as quoting or emphasizing
pieces of text. The manual domain is defined as macros that
are a subset of the day to day informal language used to
describe commands, routines and related BSD files. Macros in
the manual domain handle command names, command-line
arguments and options, function names, function parameters,
pathnames, variables, cross refer- ences to other manual
pages, and so on. These domain items have value for both the
author and the future user of the manual page. It is hoped
the consistency gained across the manual set will provide
easier transla- tion to future documentation tools.</p>

<p>Throughout the UNIX manual pages, a manual entry is
simply referred to as a man page, regardless of actual
length and without sexist intention.</p>

<p>11. BUGS</p>

<p>TROFF IDIOSYNCRASIES The -mdoc package attempts to
simplify the process of writing a man page. Theoretically,
one should not have to learn the dirty details of troff(1)
to use -mdoc; however, there are a few limitations which are
unavoidable and best gotten out of the way. And, too, be
forewarned, this package is not fast.</p>

<p>Macro Usage As in troff(1), a macro is called by placing
a . (dot character) at the beginning of a line followed by
the two character name for the macro. Arguments may follow
the macro separated by spaces. It is the dot char- acter at
the beginning of the line which causes troff(1) to interpret
the next two characters as a macro name. To place a . (dot
character) at the beginning of a line in some context other
than a macro invocation, precede the . (dot) with the escape
sequence. The translates literally to a zero width space,
and is never displayed in the output.</p>

<p>In general, troff(1) macros accept up to nine arguments,
any extra argu- ments are ignored. Most macros in -mdoc
accept nine arguments and, in limited cases, arguments may
be continued or extended on the next line (See Extensions).
A few macros handle quoted arguments (see Passing Space
Characters in an Argument below).</p>

<p>Most of the -mdoc general text domain and manual domain
macros are spe- cial in that their argument lists are parsed
for callable macro names. This means an argument on the
argument list which matches a general text or manual domain
macro name and is determined to be callable will be exe-
cuted or called when it is processed. In this case the
argument, although the name of a macro, is not preceded by a
. (dot). It is in this manner that many macros are nested;
for example the option macro, .Op , may call the flag and
argument macros, Fl and Ar, to specify an optional flag with
an argument:</p>

<p>[-s bytes] is produced by .Op Fl s Ar bytes</p>

<p>To prevent a two character string from being interpreted
as a macro name, precede the string with the escape sequence
:</p>

<p>[Fl s Ar bytes] is produced by .Op Fl s Ar bytes</p>

<p>Here the strings Fl and Ar are not interpreted as
macros. Macros whose argument lists are parsed for callable
arguments are referred to as parsed and macros which may be
called from an argument list are referred to as callable
throughout this document and in the companion quick refer-
ence manual mdoc(7). This is a technical faux pas as almost
all of the macros in -mdoc are parsed, but as it was
cumbersome to constantly refer to macros as being callable
and being able to call other macros, the term parsed has
been used.</p>

<p>Passing Space Characters in an Argument Sometimes it is
desirable to give as one argument a string containing one or
more blank space characters. This may be necessary to defeat
the nine argument limit or to specify arguments to macros
which expect particular arrangement of items in the argument
list. For example, the function macro .Fn expects the first
argument to be the name of a function and any remaining
arguments to be function parameters. As ANSI C stipulates
the declaration of function parameters in the parenthesized
parameter list, each parameter is guaranteed to be at
minimum a two word string. For example, int foo.</p>

<p>There are two possible ways to pass an argument which
contains an embed- ded space. Implementation note:
Unfortunately, the most convenient way of passing spaces in
between quotes by reassigning individual arguments before
parsing was fairly expensive speed wise and space wise to
imple- ment in all the macros for AT&amp;T troff. It is not
expensive for groff but for the sake of portability, has
been limited to the following macros which need it the
most:</p>

<p>Cd Configuration declaration (section 4 SYNOPSIS) Bl
Begin list (for the width specifier). Em Emphasized text. Fn
Functions (sections two and four). It List items. Li Literal
text. Sy Symbolic text. %B Book titles. %J Journal names. %O
Optional notes for a reference. %R Report title (in a
reference). %T Title of article in a book or journal.</p>

<p>One way of passing a string containing blank spaces is
to use the hard or unpaddable space character , that is, a
blank space preceded by the escape character . This method
may be used with any macro but has the side effect of
interfering with the adjustment of text over the length of a
line. Troff sees the hard space as if it were any other
printable character and cannot split the string into blank
or newline separated pieces as one would expect. The method
is useful for strings which are not expected to overlap a
line boundary. For example:</p>

<p>fetch(char *str) is created by .Fn fetch char *str</p>

<p>fetch(char *str) can also be created by .Fn fetch
&quot;char *str&quot;</p>

<p>If the or quotes were omitted, .Fn would see three
arguments and the result would be:</p>

<p>fetch(char, *str)</p>

<p>For an example of what happens when the parameter list
overlaps a newline boundary, see the BUGS section.</p>

<p>Trailing Blank Space Characters Troff can be confused by
blank space characters at the end of a line. It is a wise
preventive measure to globally remove all blank spaces from
&lt;blank-space&gt;&lt;end-of-line&gt; character sequences.
Should the need arise to force a blank character at the end
of a line, it may be forced with an unpaddable space and the
escape character. For example, string .</p>

<p>Escaping Special Characters , are handled by Special
characters like the newline character 0 replacing the with \
(e.g. \n) to preserve the backslash.</p>

<p>THE ANATOMY OF A MAN PAGE The body of a man page is
easily constructed from a basic template found in the file
/usr/share/misc/mdoc.template. Several example man pages can
also be found in /usr/share/examples/mdoc.</p>

<p>A manual page template . .Dd Month day, year .Os
OPERATING_SYSTEM [version/release] .Dt DOCUMENT_TITLE
[section number] [volume] .Sh NAME .Nm name .Nd one line
description of name .Sh SYNOPSIS .Sh DESCRIPTION . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>The first items in the template are the macros (.Dd,
.Os, .Dt); the docu- ment date, the operating system the man
page or subject source is devel- oped or modified for, and
the man page title (in upper case) along with the section of
the manual the page belongs in. These macros identify the
page, and are discussed below in TITLE MACROS.</p>

<p>The remaining items in the template are section headers
(.Sh); of which NAME, SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION are
mandatory. The headers are discussed in PAGE STRUCTURE
DOMAIN, after presentation of MANUAL DOMAIN. Several content
macros are used to demonstrate page layout macros; reading
about content macros before page layout macros is
recommended.</p>

<p>TITLE MACROS The title macros are the first portion of
the page structure domain, but are presented first and
separate for someone who wishes to start writing a man page
yesterday. Three header macros designate the document title
or manual page title, the operating system, and the date of
authorship. These macros are one called once at the very
beginning of the document and are used to construct the
headers and footers only.</p>

<p>.Dt DOCUMENT_TITLE section# [volume] The document title
is the subject of the man page and must be in CAPITALS due
to troff limitations. The section number may be 1, ..., 8,
and if it is specified, the volume title may be omit- ted. A
volume title may be arbitrary or one of the following:</p>

<p>AMD UNIX Ancestral Manual Documents SMM UNIX System
Managers Manual URM UNIX Reference Manual PRM UNIX
Programmers Manual</p>

<p>The default volume labeling is URM for sections 1, 6,
and 7; SMM for section 8; PRM for sections 2, 3, 4, and
5.</p>

<p>.Os operating_system release# The name of the operating
system should be the common acronym, for example, BSD or
FreeBSD or ATT. The release should be the standard release
nomenclature for the system specified, for exam- ple, 4.3,
4.3+Tahoe, V.3, V.4. Unrecognized arguments are dis- played
as given in the page footer. For instance, a typical footer
might be:</p>

<p>.Os 4.3BSD</p>

<p>or .Os FreeBSD 2.2</p>

<p>or for a locally produced set</p>

<p>.Os CS Department</p>

<p>The Berkeley default, .Os without an argument, has been
defined as BSD in the site-specific file
/usr/share/tmac/mdoc/doc-common. It really should default to
LOCAL. Note, if the .Os macro is not present, the bottom
left corner of the page will be ugly.</p>

<p>.Dd month day, year The date should be written
formally:</p>

<p>January 25, 1989</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL AND GENERAL TEXT DOMAINS Whas in
a name... The manual domain macro names are derived from the
day to day informal language used to describe commands,
subroutines and related files. Slightly different variations
of this language are used to describe the three different
aspects of writing a man page. First, there is the
description of -mdoc macro request usage. Second is the
description of a UNIX command with -mdoc macros and third,
the description of a command to a user in the verbal sense;
that is, discussion of a command in the text of a man
page.</p>

<p>In the first case, troff(1) macros are themselves a type
of command; the general syntax for a troff command is:</p>

<p>.Va argument1 argument2 ... argument9</p>

<p>The .Va is a macro command or request, and anything
following it is an argument to be processed. In the second
case, the description of a UNIX command using the content
macros is a bit more involved; a typical SYNOPSIS command
line might be displayed as:</p>

<p>filter [-flag] infile outfile</p>

<p>Here, filter is the command name and the bracketed
string -flag is a flag argument designated as optional by
the option brackets. In -mdoc terms, infile and outfile are
called arguments. The macros which formatted the above
example:</p>

<p>.Nm filter .Op Fl flag .Ar infile outfile</p>

<p>In the third case, discussion of commands and command
syntax includes both examples above, but may add more
detail. The arguments infile and outfile from the example
above might be referred to as operands or file arguments.
Some command-line argument lists are quite long:</p>

<p>make [-eiknqrstv] [-D variable] [-d flags] [-f makefile]
[-I directory] [-j max_jobs] [variable=value] [target
...]</p>

<p>Here one might talk about the command make and qualify
the argument makefile, as an argument to the flag, -f, or
discuss the optional file operand target. In the verbal
context, such detail can prevent confu- sion, however the
-mdoc package does not have a macro for an argument to a
flag. Instead the Ar argument macro is used for an operand
or file argument like target as well as an argument to a
flag like variable. The make command line was produced
from:</p>

<p>.Nm make .Op Fl eiknqrstv .Op Fl D Ar variable .Op Fl d
Ar flags .Op Fl f Ar makefile .Op Fl I Ar directory .Op Fl j
Ar max_jobs .Op Ar variable=value .Bk -words .Op Ar target
... .Ek</p>

<p>The .Bk and .Ek macros are explained in Keeps.</p>

<p>General Syntax The manual domain and general text domain
macros share a similar syntax with a few minor deviations:
.Ar, .Fl, .Nm, and .Pa differ only when called without
arguments; .Fn and .Xr impose an order on their argument
lists and the .Op and .Fn macros have nesting limitations.
All content macros are capable of recognizing and properly
handling punc- tuation, provided each punctuation character
is separated by a leading space. If a request is given:</p>

<p>.Li sptr, ptr),</p>

<p>The result is:</p>

<p>sptr, ptr),</p>

<p>The punctuation is not recognized and all is output in
the literal font. If the punctuation is separated by a
leading white space:</p>

<p>.Li sptr , ptr ) ,</p>

<p>The result is:</p>

<p>sptr, ptr),</p>

<p>The punctuation is now recognized and is output in the
default font dis- tinguishing it from the strings in literal
font.</p>

<p>To remove the special meaning from a punctuation
character escape it with . Troff is limited as a macro
language, and has difficulty when pre- sented with a string
containing a member of the mathematical, logical or
quotation set:</p>


<p>{+,-,/,*,%,&lt;,&gt;,&lt;=,&gt;=,=,==,&amp;,,,&quot;}</p>

<p>The problem is that troff may assume it is supposed to
actually perform the operation or evaluation suggested by
the characters. To prevent the accidental evaluation of
these characters, escape them with . Typi- cal syntax is
shown in the first content macro displayed below, .Ad.</p>

<p>MANUAL DOMAIN Address Macro The address macro identifies
an address construct of the form addr1[,addr2[,addr3]].</p>

<p>Usage: .Ad address ... .Ad addr1 addr1 .Ad addr1 .
addr1. .Ad addr1 , file2 addr1, file2 .Ad f1 , f2 , f3 : f1,
f2, f3: .Ad addr ) ) , addr)),</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Ad without arguments. .Ad is
callable by other macros and is parsed.</p>

<p>Author Name The .An macro is used to specify the name of
the author of the item being documented, or the name of the
author of the actual manual page. Any remaining arguments
after the name information are assumed to be
punctuation.</p>

<p>Usage: .An author_name .An Joe Author Joe Author .An Joe
Author , Joe Author, .An Joe Author Aq nobody@FreeBSD.ORG
Joe Author nobody@FreeBSD.ORG .An Joe Author ) ) , Joe
Author)),</p>

<p>The .An macro is parsed and is callable. It is an error
to call .An without any arguments.</p>

<p>Argument Macro The .Ar argument macro may be used
whenever a command-line argument is referenced.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ar argument ... .Ar file ... .Ar file1 file1 .Ar
file1 . file1. .Ar file1 file2 file1 file2 .Ar f1 f2 f3 : f1
f2 f3: .Ar file ) ) , file)),</p>

<p>If .Ar is called without arguments file ... is assumed.
The .Ar macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Configuration Declaration (section four only) The .Cd
macro is used to demonstrate a config(8) declaration for a
device interface in a section four manual. This macro
accepts quoted arguments (double quotes only).</p>

<p>device le0 at scode? produced by: .Cd device le0 at
scode?.</p>

<p>Command Modifier The command modifier is identical to
the .Fl (flag) command with the exception the .Cm macro does
not assert a dash in front of every argu- ment.
Traditionally flags are marked by the preceding dash, some
com- mands or subsets of commands do not use them. Command
modifiers may also be specified in conjunction with
interactive commands such as editor com- mands. See
Flags.</p>

<p>Defined Variables A variable which is defined in an
include file is specified by the macro .Dv.</p>

<p>Usage: .Dv defined_variable ... .Dv MAXHOSTNAMELEN
MAXHOSTNAMELEN .Dv TIOCGPGRP ) TIOCGPGRP)</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Dv without arguments. .Dv is
parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Errns (Section two only) The .Er errno macro specifies
the error return value for section two library routines. The
second example below shows .Er used with the .Bq general
text domain macro, as it would be used in a section two
manual page.</p>

<p>Usage: .Er ERRNOTYPE ... .Er ENOENT ENOENT .Er ENOENT )
; ENOENT); .Bq Er ENOTDIR [ENOTDIR]</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Er without arguments. The .Er
macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Environment Variables The .Ev macro specifies an
environment variable.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ev argument ... .Ev DISPLAY DISPLAY .Ev PATH .
PATH. .Ev PRINTER ) ) , PRINTER)),</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Ev without arguments. The .Ev
macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Function Argument The .Fa macro is used to refer to
function arguments (parameters) out- side of the SYNOPSIS
section of the manual or inside the SYNOPSIS section should
a parameter list be too long for the .Fn macro and the
enclosure macros .Fo and .Fc must be used. .Fa may also be
used to refer to structure members.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fa function_argument ... .Fa d_namlen ) ) ,
d_namlen)), .Fa iov_len iov_len</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Fa without arguments. .Fa is
parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Function Declaration The .Fd macro is used in the
SYNOPSIS section with section two or three functions. The
.Fd macro does not call other macros and is not callable by
other macros.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fd include_file (or defined variable)</p>

<p>In the SYNOPSIS section a .Fd request causes a line
break if a function has already been presented and a break
has not occurred. This leaves a nice vertical space in
between the previous function call and the decla- ration for
the next function.</p>

<p>Flags The .Fl macro handles command-line flags. It
prepends a dash, -, to the flag. For interactive command
flags, which are not prepended with a dash, the .Cm (command
modifier) macro is identical, but without the dash.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fl argument ... .Fl - .Fl cfv -cfv .Fl cfv .
-cfv. .Fl s v t -s -v -t .Fl - , --, .Fl xyz ) , -xyz),</p>

<p>The .Fl macro without any arguments results in a dash
representing stdin/stdout. Note that giving .Fl a single
dash, will result in two dashes. The .Fl macro is parsed and
is callable.</p>

<p>Functions (library routines) The .Fn macro is modeled on
ANSI C conventions.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fn [type] function [[type] parameters ... ] .Fn
getchar getchar() .Fn strlen ) , strlen()), .Fn &quot;int
align&quot; &quot;const * char *sptrs&quot;, int align(const
* char *sptrs),</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Fn without any arguments. The
.Fn macro is parsed and is callable, note that any call to
another macro signals the end of the .Fn call (it will
close-parenthesis at that point).</p>

<p>For functions that have more than eight parameters (and
this is rare), the macros .Fo (function open) and .Fc
(function close) may be used with .Fa (function argument) to
get around the limitation. For exam- ple:</p>

<p>.Fo &quot;int res_mkquery&quot; .Fa &quot;int op&quot;
.Fa &quot;char *dname&quot; .Fa &quot;int class&quot; .Fa
&quot;int type&quot; .Fa &quot;char *data&quot; .Fa
&quot;int datalen&quot; .Fa &quot;struct rrec *newrr&quot;
.Fa &quot;char *buf&quot; .Fa &quot;int buflen&quot; .Fc</p>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p>int res_mkquery(int op, char *dname, int class, int
type, char *data, int datalen, struct rrec *newrr, char
*buf, int buflen)</p>

<p>The .Fo and .Fc macros are parsed and are callable. In
the SYNOPSIS section, the function will always begin at the
beginning of line. If there is more than one function
presented in the SYNOPSIS section and a function type has
not been given, a line break will occur, leaving a nice
vertical space between the current function name and the one
prior. At the moment, .Fn does not check its word boundaries
against troff line lengths and may split across a newline
ungracefully. This will be fixed in the near future.</p>

<p>Function Type This macro is intended for the SYNOPSIS
section. It may be used anywhere else in the man page
without problems, but its main purpose is to present the
function type in kernel normal form for the SYNOPSIS of
sections two and three (it causes a line break allowing the
function name to appear on the next line).</p>

<p>Usage: .Ft type ... .Ft struct stat struct stat</p>

<p>The .Ft request is not callable by other macros.</p>

<p>Interactive Commands The .Ic macro designates an
interactive or internal command.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ic argument ... .Ic :wq :wq .Ic do while {...}
do while {...} .Ic setenv , unsetenv setenv, unsetenv</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Ic without arguments. The .Ic
macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Name Macro The .Nm macro is used for the document title
or subject name. It has the peculiarity of remembering the
first argument it was called with, which should always be
the subject name of the page. When called without arguments,
.Nm regurgitates this initial name for the sole purpose of
making less work for the author. Note: a section two or
three document function name is addressed with the .Nm in
the NAME section, and with .Fn in the SYNOPSIS and remaining
sections. For interactive commands, such as the while
command keyword in csh(1), the .Ic macro should be used.
While the .Ic is nearly identical to .Nm, it can not recall
the first argument it was invoked with.</p>

<p>Usage: .Nm argument ... .Nm mdoc.sample mdoc.sample .Nm
&minus;mdoc -mdoc. .Nm foo ) ) , foo)), .Nm mdoc.samples</p>

<p>The .Nm macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Options The .Op macro places option brackets around the
any remaining arguments on the command line, and places any
trailing punctuation outside the brackets. The macros .Oc
and .Oo may be used across one or more lines.</p>

<p>Usage: .Op options ... .Op [] .Op Fl k [-k] .Op Fl k ) .
[-k]). .Op Fl k Ar kookfile [-k kookfile] .Op Fl k Ar
kookfile , [-k kookfile], .Op Ar objfil Op Ar corfil [objfil
[corfil]] .Op Fl c Ar objfil Op Ar corfil , [-c objfil
[corfil]], .Op word1 word2 [word1 word2]</p>

<p>The .Oc and .Oo macros:</p>

<p>.Oo .Op Fl k Ar kilobytes .Op Fl i Ar interval .Op Fl c
Ar count .Oc</p>

<p>Produce: [[-k kilobytes] [-i interval] [-c count]]</p>

<p>The macros .Op, .Oc and .Oo are parsed and are
callable.</p>

<p>Pathnames The .Pa macro formats pathnames or
filenames.</p>

<p>Usage: .Pa pathname .Pa /usr/share /usr/share .Pa
/tmp/fooXXXXX ) . /tmp/fooXXXXX).</p>

<p>The .Pa macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Variables Generic variable reference:</p>

<p>Usage: .Va variable ... .Va count count .Va settimer,
settimer, .Va int *prt ) : int *prt): .Va char s ] ) ) ,
char s])),</p>

<p>It is an error to call .Va without any arguments. The
.Va macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Manual Page Cross References The .Xr macro expects the
first argument to be a manual page name, and the second
argument, if it exists, to be either a section page number
or punctuation. Any remaining arguments are assumed to be
punctuation.</p>

<p>Usage: .Xr man_page [1,...,8] .Xr mdoc mdoc .Xr mdoc ,
mdoc, .Xr mdoc 7 mdoc(7) .Xr mdoc 7 ) ) , mdoc(7))),</p>

<p>The .Xr macro is parsed and is callable. It is an error
to call .Xr without any arguments.</p>

<p>GENERAL TEXT DOMAIN AT&amp;T Macro Usage: .At [v6 | v7 |
32v | V.1 | V.4] ... .At AT&amp;T UNIX .At v6 . Version 6
AT&amp;T UNIX.</p>

<p>The .At macro is not parsed and not callable It accepts
at most two arguments.</p>

<p>BSD Macro Usage: .Bx [Version/release] ... .Bx BSD .Bx
4.3 . 4.3BSD.</p>

<p>The .Bx macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>FreeBSD Macro Usage: .Fx Version.release ... .Fx 2.2 .
FreeBSD 2.2.</p>

<p>The .Fx macro is not parsed and not callable It accepts
at most two arguments.</p>

<p>UNIX Macro Usage: .Ux ... .Ux UNIX</p>

<p>The .Ux macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Enclosure and Quoting Macros The concept of enclosure is
similar to quoting. The object being to enclose one or more
strings between a pair of characters like quotes or
parentheses. The terms quoting and enclosure are used
interchangeably throughout this document. Most of the one
line enclosure macros end in small letter q to give a hint
of quoting, but there are a few irregu- larities. For each
enclosure macro there is also a pair of open and close
macros which end in small letters o and c respectively.
These can be used across one or more lines of text and while
they have nesting limitations, the one line quote macros can
be used inside of them.</p>

<p>Quote Close Open Function Result .Aq .Ac .Ao Angle
Bracket Enclosure &lt;string&gt; .Bq .Bc .Bo Bracket
Enclosure [string] .Dq .Dc .Do Double Quote string .Ec .Eo
Enclose String (in XX) XXstringXX .Pq .Pc .Po Parenthesis
Enclosure (string) .Ql Quoted Literal st or string .Qq .Qc
.Qo Straight Double Quote &quot;string&quot; .Sq .Sc .So
Single Quote string</p>

<p>Except for the irregular macros noted below, all of the
quoting macros are parsed and callable. All handle
punctuation properly, as long as it is presented one
character at a time and separated by spaces. The quot- ing
macros examine opening and closing punctuation to determine
whether it comes before or after the enclosing string This
makes some nesting possible.</p>

<p>.Ec, .Eo These macros expect the first argument to be
the opening and closing strings respectively.</p>

<p>.Ql The quoted literal macro behaves differently for
troff than nroff. If formatted with nroff, a quoted literal
is always quoted. If formatted with troff, an item is only
quoted if the width of the item is less than three constant
width characters. This is to make short strings more visible
where the font change to literal (constant width) is less
noticeable.</p>

<p>.Pf The prefix macro is not callable, but it is
parsed:</p>

<p>.Pf ( Fa name2 becomes (name2.</p>

<p>The .Ns (no space) macro performs the analogous suffix
func- tion.</p>

<p>Examples of quoting: .Aq .Aq Ar ctype.h ) , ctype.h),
.Bq [] .Bq Em Greek , French . [Greek, French]. .Dq .Dq
string abc . string abc. .Dq &acute;^[A-Z]&acute;
&acute;^[A-Z]&acute; .Ql man mdoc man mdoc .Qq &quot;&quot;
.Qq string ) , &quot;string&quot;), .Qq string Ns ),
&quot;string),&quot; .Sq .Sq string string</p>

<p>For a good example of nested enclosure macros, see the
.Op option macro. It was created from the same underlying
enclosure macros as those presented in the list above. The
.Xo and .Xc extended argument list macros were also built
from the same underlying routines and are a good example of
-mdoc macro usage at its worst.</p>

<p>No-Op or Normal Text Macro The macro .No is a hack for
words in a macro command line which should not be formatted
and follows the conventional syntax for content macros.</p>

<p>Space Macro The .Ns macro eliminates unwanted spaces in
between macro requests. It is useful for old style argument
lists where there is no space between the flag and
argument:</p>

<p>.Op Fl I Ns Ar directory produces [-Idirectory]</p>

<p>Note: the .Ns macro always invokes the .No macro after
eliminating the space unless another macro name follows it.
The macro .Ns is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>Section Cross References The .Sx macro designates a
reference to a section header within the same document. It
is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>.Sx FILES FILES</p>

<p>References and Citations The following macros make a
modest attempt to handle references. At best, the macros
make it convenient to manually drop in a subset of refer
style references.</p>

<p>.Rs Reference Start. Causes a line break and begins
collection of reference information until the reference end
macro is read. .Re Reference End. The reference is printed.
.%A Reference author name, one name per invocation. .%B Book
title. .%C City/place. .%D Date. .%J Journal name. .%N Issue
number. .%O Optional information. .%P Page number. .%R
Report name. .%T Title of article. .%V Volume(s).</p>

<p>The macros beginning with % are not callable, and are
parsed only for the trade name macro which returns to its
caller. (And not very pre- dictably at the moment either.)
The purpose is to allow trade names to be pretty printed in
troff/ditroff output.</p>

<p>Return Values The .Rv macro generates text for use in
the RETURN VALUE section.</p>

<p>Usage: .Rv [-std function]</p>

<p>.Rv -std atexit will generate the following text:</p>

<p>The atexit() function returns the value 0 if successful;
otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable
errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The -std option is valid only for manual page sections 2
and 3.</p>

<p>Trade Names (or Acronyms and Type Names) The trade name
macro is generally a small caps macro for all upper case
words longer than two characters.</p>

<p>Usage: .Tn symbol ... .Tn DEC DEC .Tn ASCII ASCII</p>

<p>The .Tn macro is parsed and is callable by other
macros.</p>

<p>Extended Arguments The .Xo and .Xc macros allow one to
extend an argument list on a macro boundary. Argument lists
cannot be extended within a macro which expects all of its
arguments on one line such as .Op.</p>

<p>Here is an example of .Xo using the space mode macro to
turn spacing off:</p>

<p>.Sm off .It Xo Sy I Ar operation .No \n Ar count No \n
.Xc .Sm on</p>

<p>Produces</p>

<p>Ioperationcount</p>

<p>Another one:</p>

<p>.Sm off .It Cm S No / Ar old_pattern Xo .No / Ar
new_pattern .No / Op Cm g .Xc .Sm on</p>

<p>Produces</p>

<p>S/old_pattern/new_pattern/[g]</p>

<p>Another example of .Xo and using enclosure macros: Test
the value of a variable.</p>

<p>.It Xo .Ic .ifndef .Oo ! Oc Ns Ar variable .Op Ar
operator variable ... .Xc</p>

<p>Produces</p>

<p>.ifndef [!]variable [operator variable ...]</p>

<p>All of the above examples have used the .Xo macro on the
argument list of the .It (list-item) macro. The extend
macros are not used very often, and when they are it is
usually to extend the list-item argument list.
Unfortunately, this is also where the extend macros are the
most finicky. In the first two examples, spacing was turned
off; in the third, spacing was desired in part of the output
but not all of it. To make these macros work in this
situation make sure the .Xo and .Xc macros are placed as
shown in the third example. If the .Xo macro is not alone on
the .It argument list, spacing will be unpredictable. The
.Ns (no space macro) must not occur as the first or last
macro on a line in this situation. Out of 900 manual pages
(about 1500 actual pages) currently released with BSD only
fifteen use the .Xo macro.</p>

<p>PAGE STRUCTURE DOMAIN Section Headers The first three
.Sh section header macros list below are required in every
man page. The remaining section headers are recommended at
the discretion of the author writing the manual page. The
.Sh macro can take up to nine arguments. It is parsed and
but is not callable.</p>

<p>.Sh NAME The .Sh NAME macro is mandatory. If not
specified, the head- ers, footers and page layout defaults
will not be set and things will be rather unpleasant. The
NAME section consists of at least three items. The first is
the .Nm name macro naming the subject of the man page. The
second is the Name Descrip- tion macro, .Nd, which separates
the subject name from the third item, which is the
description. The description should be the most terse and
lucid possible, as the space available is small.</p>

<p>.Sh SYNOPSIS The SYNOPSIS section describes the typical
usage of the subject of a man page. The macros required are
either .Nm , .Cd, .Fn, (and possibly .Fo, .Fc, .Fd , .Ft
macros). The function name macro .Fn is required for manual
page sections 2 and 3, the command and general name macro
.Nm is required for sections 1, 5, 6, 7, 8. Section 4
manuals require a .Nm, .Fd or a .Cd configuration device
usage macro. Several other macros may be necessary to
produce the synopsis line as shown below:</p>

<p>cat [-benstuv] [-] file ...</p>

<p>The following macros were used:</p>

<p>.Nm cat .Op Fl benstuv .Op Fl .Ar</p>

<p>Note: The macros .Op, .Fl, and .Ar recognize the pipe
bar character |, so a command line such as:</p>

<p>.Op Fl a | Fl b</p>

<p>will not go orbital. Troff normally interprets a | as a
spe- cial operator. See PREDEFINED STRINGS for a usable |
character in other situations.</p>

<p>.Sh DESCRIPTION In most cases the first text in the
DESCRIPTION section is a brief paragraph on the command,
function or file, followed by a lexical list of options and
respective explanations. To create such a list, the .Bl
begin-list, .It list-item and .El end-list macros are used
(see Lists and Columns below).</p>

<p>The following .Sh section headers are part of the
preferred manual page layout and must be used appropriately
to maintain consistency. They are listed in the order in
which they would be used.</p>

<p>.Sh ENVIRONMENT The ENVIRONMENT section should reveal
any related environment variables and clues to their
behavior and/or usage.</p>

<p>.Sh EXAMPLES There are several ways to create examples.
See the EXAMPLES section below for details.</p>

<p>.Sh FILES Files which are used or created by the man
page subject should be listed via the .Pa macro in the FILES
section.</p>

<p>.Sh SEE ALSO References to other material on the man
page topic and cross references to other relevant man pages
should be placed in the SEE ALSO section. Cross references
are specified using the .Xr macro. Cross references in the
SEE ALSO section should be sorted by section number, and
then placed in alphabetical order and comma separated. For
example:</p>

<p>ls(1), ps(1), group(5), passwd(5).</p>

<p>At this time refer(1) style references are not
accommodated.</p>

<p>.Sh CONFORMING TO If the command, library function or
file adheres to a specific implementation such as IEEE Std
1003.2 ( POSIX.2 ) or ANSI X3.159-1989 ( ANSI C) this should
be noted here. If the com- mand does not adhere to any
standard, its history should be noted in the HISTORY
section.</p>

<p>.Sh HISTORY Any command which does not adhere to any
specific standards should be outlined historically in this
section.</p>

<p>.Sh AUTHORS Credits, if need be, should be placed
here.</p>

<p>.Sh DIAGNOSTICS Diagnostics from a command should be
placed in this section.</p>

<p>.Sh ERRORS Specific error handling, especially from
library functions (man page sections 2 and 3) should go
here. The .Er macro is used to specify an errno.</p>

<p>.Sh BUGS Blatant problems with the topic go here...</p>

<p>User specified .Sh sections may be added, for example,
this section was set with:</p>

<p>.Sh PAGE STRUCTURE DOMAIN</p>

<p>Paragraphs and Line Spacing. .Pp The .Pp paragraph
command may be used to specify a line space where necessary.
The macro is not necessary after a .Sh or .Ss macro or
before a .Bl macro. (The .Bl macro asserts a vertical
distance unless the -compact flag is given).</p>

<p>Keeps The only keep that is implemented at this time is
for words. The macros are .Bk (begin-keep) and .Ek
(end-keep). The only option that .Bk accepts is -words and
is useful for preventing line breaks in the middle of
options. In the example for the make command-line arguments
(see Whats in a name), the keep prevented nroff from placing
up the flag and the argument on separate lines. (Actually,
the option macro used to pre- vent this from occurring, but
was dropped when the decision (religious) was made to force
right justified margins in troff as options in general look
atrocious when spread across a sparse line. More work needs
to be done with the keep macros, a -line option needs to be
added.)</p>

<p>Examples and Displays There are five types of displays,
a quickie one line indented display .D1 , a quickie one line
literal display .Dl, and a block literal, block filled and
block ragged which use the .Bd begin-display and .Ed
end-display macros.</p>

<p>.D1 (D-one) Display one line of indented text. This
macro is parsed, but it is not callable.</p>

<p>-ldghfstru</p>

<p>The above was produced by: .Dl -ldghfstru.</p>

<p>.Dl (D-ell) Display one line of indented literal text.
The .Dl example macro has been used throughout this file. It
allows the indent (display) of one line of text. Its default
font is set to constant width (literal) however it is parsed
and will recognized other macros. It is not callable
however.</p>

<p>% ls -ldg /usr/local/bin</p>

<p>The above was produced by .Dl % ls -ldg
/usr/local/bin.</p>

<p>.Bd Begin-display. The .Bd display must be ended with
the .Ed macro. Displays may be nested within displays and
lists. .Bd has the following syntax:</p>

<p>.Bd display-type [-offset offset_value] [-compact]</p>

<p>The display-type must be one of the following four types
and may have an offset specifier for indentation: .Bd.</p>

<p>-ragged Display a block of text as typed, right (and
left) margin edges are left ragged. -filled Display a filled
(formatted) block. The block of text is formatted (the edges
are filled - not left unjustified). -literal Display a
literal block, useful for source code or simple tabbed or
spaced text. -file file_name The filename following the
-file flag is read and displayed. Literal mode is asserted
and tabs are set at 8 constant width character intervals,
however any troff/-mdoc commands in file will be processed.
-offset string If -offset is specified with one of the
follow- ing strings, the string is interpreted to indi- cate
the level of indentation for the forthcom- ing block of
text:</p>

<p>left Align block on the current left mar- gin, this is
the default mode of .Bd. center Supposedly center the block.
At this time unfortunately, the block merely gets left
aligned about an imaginary center margin. indent Indents by
one default indent value or tab. The default indent value is
also used for the .D1 display so one is guaranteed the two
types of displays will line up. This indent is normally set
to 6n or about two thirds of an inch (six constant width
characters). indent-two Indents two times the default indent
value. right This left aligns the block about two inches
from the right side of the page. This macro needs work and
perhaps may never do the right thing by troff.</p>

<p>.Ed End-display.</p>

<p>Font Modes There are five macros for changing the
appearance of the manual page text:</p>

<p>.Em Text may be stressed or emphasized with the .Em
macro. The usual font for emphasis is italic.</p>

<p>Usage: .Em argument ... .Em does not does not .Em exceed
1024 . exceed 1024. .Em vide infra ) ) , vide infra)),</p>

<p>The .Em macro is parsed and is callable. It is an error
to call .Em without arguments.</p>

<p>.Li The .Li literal macro may be used for special
characters, vari- able constants, anything which should be
displayed as it would be typed.</p>

<p>Usage: .Li argument ... .Li \n .Li M1 M2 M3 ; M1 M2 M3;
.Li cntrl-D ) , cntrl-D), .Li 1024 ... 1024 ...</p>

<p>The .Li macro is parsed and is callable.</p>

<p>.Sy The symbolic emphasis macro is generally a boldface
macro in either the symbolic sense or the traditional
English usage.</p>

<p>Usage: .Sy symbol ... .Sy Important Notice Important
Notice</p>

<p>The .Sy macro is parsed and is callable. Arguments to
.Sy may be quoted.</p>

<p>.Bf Begin font mode. The .Bf font mode must be ended
with the .Ef macro. Font modes may be nested within other
font modes. .Bf has the following syntax:</p>

<p>.Bf font-mode</p>

<p>The font-mode must be one of the following three types:
.Bf.</p>

<p>Em | -emphasis Same as if the .Em macro was used for the
entire block of text. Li | -literal Same as if the .Li macro
was used for the entire block of text. Sy | -symbolic Same
as if the .Sy macro was used for the entire block of
text.</p>

<p>.Ef End font mode.</p>

<p>Tagged Lists and Columns There are several types of
lists which may be initiated with the .Bl begin-list macro.
Items within the list are specified with the .It item macro
and each list must end with the .El macro. Lists may be
nested within themselves and within displays. Columns may be
used inside of lists, but lists are unproven inside of
columns.</p>

<p>In addition, several list attributes may be specified
such as the width of a tag, the list offset, and compactness
(blank lines between items allowed or disallowed). Most of
this document has been formatted with a tag style list
(-tag). For a change of pace, the list-type used to present
the list-types is an over-hanging list (-ohang). This type
of list is quite popular with TeX users, but might look a
bit funny after having read many pages of tagged lists. The
following list types are accepted by .Bl:</p>

<p>-bullet -item -enum These three are the simplest types
of lists. Once the .Bl macro has been given, items in the
list are merely indicated by a line consisting solely of the
.It macro. For example, the source text for a simple
enumerated list would look like:</p>

<p>.Bl -enum -compact .It Item one goes here. .It And item
two here. .It Lastly item three goes here. .El</p>

<p>The results:</p>

<p>1. Item one goes here. 2. And item two here. 3. Lastly
item three goes here.</p>

<p>A simple bullet list construction:</p>

<p>.Bl -bullet -compact .It Bullet one goes here. .It
Bullet two here. .El</p>

<p>Produces: &middot; Bullet one goes here. &middot; Bullet
two here.</p>

<p>-tag -diag -hang -ohang -inset These list-types collect
arguments specified with the .It macro and create a label
which may be inset into the forthcoming text, hanged from
the forthcoming text, overhanged from above and not indented
or tagged. This list was constructed with the -ohang
list-type. The .It macro is parsed only for the inset, hang
and tag list-types and is not callable. Here is an example
of inset labels:</p>

<p>Tag The tagged list (also called a tagged paragraph) is
the most common type of list used in the Berkeley
manuals.</p>

<p>Diag Diag lists create section four diagnostic lists and
are simi- lar to inset lists except callable macros are
ignored.</p>

<p>Hang Hanged labels are a matter of taste.</p>

<p>Ohang Overhanging labels are nice when space is
constrained.</p>

<p>Inset Inset labels are useful for controlling blocks of
paragraphs and are valuable for converting -mdoc manuals to
other formats.</p>

<p>Here is the source text which produced the above
example:</p>

<p>.Bl -inset -offset indent .It Em Tag The tagged list
(also called a tagged paragraph) is the most common type of
list used in the Berkeley manuals. .It Em Diag Diag lists
create section four diagnostic lists and are similar to
inset lists except callable macros are ignored. .It Em Hang
Hanged labels are a matter of taste. .It Em Ohang
Overhanging labels are nice when space is constrained. .It
Em Inset Inset labels are useful for controlling blocks of
paragraphs and are valuable for converting .Nm -mdoc manuals
to other formats. .El</p>

<p>Here is a hanged list with two items:</p>

<p>Hanged labels appear similar to tagged lists when the
label is smaller than the label width.</p>

<p>Longer hanged list labels blend in to the paragraph
unlike tagged paragraph labels.</p>

<p>And the unformatted text which created it:</p>

<p>.Bl -hang -offset indent .It Em Hanged labels appear
similar to tagged lists when the label is smaller than the
label width. .It Em Longer hanged list labels blend in to
the paragraph unlike tagged paragraph labels. .El</p>

<p>The tagged list which follows uses an optional width
specifier to control the width of the tag.</p>

<p>SL sleep time of the process (seconds blocked) PAGEIN
number of disk I/Os resulting from references by the pro-
cess to pages not loaded in core. UID numerical user-id of
process owner PPID numerical ID of parent of process process
priority (non- positive when in non-interruptible wait)</p>

<p>The raw text:</p>

<p>.Bl -tag -width &quot;PAGEIN&quot; -compact -offset
indent .It SL sleep time of the process (seconds blocked)
.It PAGEIN number of disk .Tn I/O Ns s resulting from
references by the process to pages not loaded in core. .It
UID numerical user ID of process owner .It PPID numerical ID
of parent of process process priority (non-positive when in
non-interruptible wait) .El</p>

<p>Acceptable width specifiers:</p>

<p>-width Fl sets the width to the default width for a
flag. All callable macros have a default width value. The
.Fl, value is presently set to ten constant width characters
or about five sixth of an inch.</p>

<p>-width 24n sets the width to 24 constant width
characters or about two inches. The n is absolutely
necessary for the scaling to work correctly.</p>

<p>-width ENAMETOOLONG sets width to the constant width
length of the string given.</p>

<p>-width &quot;int mkfifo&quot; again, the width is set to
the constant width of the string given.</p>

<p>If a width is not specified for the tag list type, the
first time .It is invoked, an attempt is made to determine
an appropriate width. If the first argument to .It is a
callable macro, the default width for that macro will be
used as if the macro name had been supplied as the width.
However, if another item in the list is given with a
different callable macro name, a new and nested list is
assumed.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED STRINGS The following strings are predefined
as may be used by preceding with the troff string
interpreting sequence where xx is the name of the defined
string or as where x is the name of the string. The inter-
preting sequence may be used any where in the text.</p>

<p>String Nroff Troff &lt;= &lt;= &gt;= &gt;= Rq Lq ua ^ aa
&acute; ga &lsquo; &lsquo; q &quot; &quot; Pi pi Ne != Le
&lt;= Ge &gt;= Lt &lt; &gt; Gt &gt; &lt; Pm +- &plusmn; If
infinity Na NaN NaN Ba | |</p>

<p>Note: The string named q should be written as since it
is only one char.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The debugging facilities for -mdoc are
limited, but can help detect sub- tle errors such as the
collision of an argument name with an internal register or
macro name. (A what?) A register is an arithmetic storage
class for troff with a one or two character name. All
registers internal to -mdoc for troff and ditroff are two
characters and of the form
&lt;upper_case&gt;&lt;lower_case&gt; such as Ar ,
&lt;lower_case&gt;&lt;upper_case&gt; as aR or &lt;upper or
lower letter&gt;&lt;digit&gt; as C1. And adding to the
muddle, troff has its own internal registers all of which
are either two lower case characters or a dot plus a letter
or metacharacter character. In one of the introduction
examples, it was shown how to prevent the inter- pretation
of a macro name with the escape sequence . This is suffi-
cient for the internal register names also.</p>

<p>If a non-escaped register name is given in the argument
list of a request unpredictable behavior will occur. In
general, any time huge portions of text do not appear where
expected in the output, or small strings such as list tags
disappear, chances are there is a misunderstanding about an
argument type in the argument list. Your mother never
intended for you to remember this evil stuff - so here is a
way to find out whether or not your arguments are valid: The
.Db (debug) macro displays the interpre- tation of the
argument list for most macros. Macros such as the .Pp
(paragraph) macro do not contain debugging information. All
of the callable macros do, and it is strongly advised
whenever in doubt, turn on the .Db macro.</p>

<p>Usage: .Db [on | off]</p>

<p>An example of a portion of text with the debug macro
placed above and below an artificially created problem (a
flag argument aC which should be aC in order to work):</p>

<p>.Db on .Op Fl aC Ar file ) .Db off</p>

<p>The resulting output:</p>

<p>DEBUGGING ON DEBUG(argv) MACRO: .Op Line #: 2 Argc: 1
Argv: Fl Length: 2 Space: Class: Executable Argc: 2 Argv: aC
Length: 2 Space: Class: Executable Argc: 3 Argv: Ar Length:
2 Space: Class: Executable Argc: 4 Argv: file Length: 4
Space: Class: String Argc: 5 Argv: ) Length: 1 Space: Class:
Closing Punctuation or suffix MACRO REQUEST: .Op Fl aC Ar
file ) DEBUGGING OFF</p>

<p>The first line of information tells the name of the
calling macro, here .Op, and the line number it appears on.
If one or more files are involved (especially if text from
another file is included) the line num- ber may be bogus. If
there is only one file, it should be accurate. The second
line gives the argument count, the argument (Fl) and its
length. If the length of an argument is two characters, the
argument is tested to see if it is executable
(unfortunately, any register which contains a non-zero value
appears executable). The third line gives the space allotted
for a class, and the class type. The problem here is the
argu- ment aC should not be executable. The four types of
classes are string, executable, closing punctuation and
opening punctuation. The last line shows the entire argument
list as it was read. In this next example, the offending aC
is escaped:</p>

<p>.Db on .Em An escaped aC .Db off</p>

<p>DEBUGGING ON DEBUG(fargv) MACRO: .Em Line #: 2 Argc: 1
Argv: An Length: 2 Space: Class: String Argc: 2 Argv:
escaped Length: 7 Space: Class: String Argc: 3 Argv: aC
Length: 2 Space: Class: String MACRO REQUEST: .Em An escaped
&amp;aC DEBUGGING OFF</p>

<p>The argument aC shows up with the same length of 2 as
the sequence produces a zero width, but a register named aC
was not found and the type classified as string.</p>

<p>Other diagnostics consist of usage statements and are
self explanatory.</p>

<p>GROFF, TROFF AND NROFF The -mdoc package does not need
compatibility mode with groff.</p>

<p>The package inhibits page breaks, and the headers and
footers which nor- mally occur at those breaks with nroff,
to make the manual more efficient for viewing on-line. At
the moment, groff with -Tascii does eject the imaginary
remainder of the page at end of file. The inhibiting of the
page breaks makes nroff d files unsuitable for hardcopy.
There is a reg- ister named cR which can be set to zero in
the site dependent style file /usr/src/share/tmac/doc-nroff
to restore the old style behavior.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/tmac/doc.tmac manual macro package
/usr/share/misc/mdoc.template template for writing a man
page /usr/share/examples/mdoc/* several example man
pages</p>

<p>BUGS Undesirable hyphenation on the dash of a flag
argument is not yet resolved, and causes occasional mishaps
in the DESCRIPTION section. (line break on the hyphen).</p>

<p>Predefined strings are not declared in
documentation.</p>

<p>Section 3f has not been added to the header
routines.</p>

<p>.Nm font should be changed in NAME section.</p>

<p>.Fn needs to have a check to prevent splitting up if the
line length is too short. Occasionally it separates the last
parenthesis, and sometimes looks ridiculous if a line is in
fill mode.</p>

<p>The method used to prevent header and footer page breaks
(other than the initial header and footer) when using nroff
occasionally places an unsightly partially filled line
(blank) at the would be bottom of the page.</p>

<p>The list and display macros to not do any keeps and
certainly should be able to.</p>
