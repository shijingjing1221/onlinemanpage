<p>SYNOPSIS cut OPTION... [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Print selected parts of lines from each FILE
to standard output.</p>

short options too.</p>

<p>-b, --bytes=LIST select only these bytes</p>

<p>-c, --characters=LIST select only these characters</p>

<p>-d, --delimiter=DELIM use DELIM instead of TAB for field
delimiter</p>

any line that contains no delimiter character, unless the -s
option is specified</p>

<p>Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f. Each LIST is made
up of one range, or many ranges separated by commas.
Selected input is written in the same order that it is read,
and is written exactly once. Each range is one of:</p>

<p>N Nth byte, character or field, counted from 1</p>

<p>N- from Nth byte, character or field, to end of line</p>

<p>N-M from Nth to Mth (included) byte, character or
field</p>

<p>-M from first to Mth (included) byte, character or
field</p>

<p>With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard
input.</p>
