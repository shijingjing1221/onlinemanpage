<p>QMOVE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QMOVE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qmove - move batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qmove destination job_identifier ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION To move a batch job is to remove the batch
job from the batch queue in which it resides and instantiate
the batch job in another batch queue. A batch job is moved
by a request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
The qmove utility is a user-accessible batch client that
requests the movement of one or more batch jobs.</p>

<p>The qmove utility shall move those batch jobs, and only
those batch jobs, for which a batch job_identifier is
presented to the utility.</p>

<p>The qmove utility shall move batch jobs in the order in
which the cor- responding batch job_identifiers are
presented to the utility.</p>

<p>If the qmove utility fails to process a batch
job_identifier success- fully, the utility shall proceed to
process the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p>The qmove utility shall move batch jobs by sending a
Move Job Request to the batch server that manages each batch
job. The qmove utility shall not exit before the batch jobs
corresponding to all successfully processed batch
job_identifiers have been moved.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qmove utility shall accept one operand that
conforms to the syntax for a destination (see Destination
).</p>

<p>The qmove utility shall accept one or more operands that
conform to the syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Batch
Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qmove:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT None.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qmove utility shall not be required to write a
diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qmove utility waits to output the diagnostic message
while attempting to locate the job on other servers is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qmove utility allows users to move jobs
between queues.</p>

<p>The alternative to using the qmove utility-deleting the
batch job and requeuing it-entails considerably more
typing.</p>

<p>Since the means of selecting jobs based on attributes
has been encapsu- lated in the qselect utility, the only
option of the qmove utility con- cerns authorization. The -u
option provides the user with the conve- nience of changing
the user identifier under which the batch job will execute.
Minimalism and consistency have taken precedence over conve-
nience; the -u option has been deleted because the
equivalent capabil- ity exists with the -u option of the
qalter utility.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
