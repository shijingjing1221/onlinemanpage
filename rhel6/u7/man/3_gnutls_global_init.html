<p>gnutls_global_init(3) gnutls gnutls_global_init(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_global_init - initialize the global data to
defaults.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_global_init( void);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS void</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function initializes the global data to
defaults. Every gnutls application has a global data which
holds common parameters shared by gnutls session structures.
You should call gnutls_global_deinit() when gnutls usage is
no longer needed</p>

<p>Note that this function will also initialize libgcrypt,
if it has not been initialized before. Thus if you want to
manually initialize libgcrypt you must do it before calling
this function. This is useful in cases you want to disable
libgcrypts internal lockings etc.</p>

<p>This function increment a global counter, so that
gnutls_global_deinit() only releases resources when it has
been called as many times as gnutls_global_init(). This is
useful when GnuTLS is used by more than one library in an
application. This function can be called many times, but
will only do something the first time.</p>

<p>Note! This function is not thread safe. If two threads
call this function simultaneously, they can cause a race
between checking the global counter and incrementing it,
causing both threads to execute the library initialization
code. That would lead to a memory leak. To handle this, your
application could invoke this function after aquiring a
thread mutex. To ignore the potential memory leak is also an
option.</p>

<p>RETURNS On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS (zero) is returned,
otherwise an error code is returned.</p>
