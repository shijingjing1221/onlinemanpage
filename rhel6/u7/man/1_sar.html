<p>SAR(1) Linux User s Manual SAR(1)</p>

<p>NAME sar - Collect, report, or save system activity
information.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sar [ -A ] [ -b ] [ -B ] [ -C ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [
-i interval ] [ -m ] [ -p ] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -S ] [ -t
] [ -u [ ALL ] ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -w ] [ -W ] [ -y ] [ -j {
ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } ] [ -n { keyword [,...] |
ALL } ] [ -I { int [,...] | SUM | ALL | XALL } ] [ -P { cpu
[,...] | ALL } ] [ -o [ filename ] | -f [ filename ] ] [
--legacy ] [ -s [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [ -e [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [
interval [ count ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sar command writes to standard output
the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the
operating system. The accounting system, based on the values
in the count and interval parameters, writes information the
specified number of times spaced at the speci- fied
intervals in seconds. If the interval parameter is set to
zero, the sar command displays the average statistics for
the time since the system was started. If the interval
parameter is specified without the count parameter, then
reports are generated continuously. The col- lected data can
also be saved in the file specified by the -o filename flag,
in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If filename
is omitted, sar uses the standard system activity daily data
file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file, where the dd parameter
indicates the current day. By default all the data available
from the kernel are saved in the data file.</p>

<p>The sar command extracts and writes to standard output
records previ- ously saved in a file. This file can be
either the one specified by the -f flag or, by default, the
standard system activity daily data file.</p>

<p>Without the -P flag, the sar command reports system-wide
(global among all processors) statistics, which are
calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages,
and as sums otherwise. If the -P flag is given, the sar
command reports activity which relates to the specified
processor or processors. If -P ALL is given, the sar command
reports statistics for each individual processor and global
statistics among all processors.</p>

<p>You can select information about specific system
activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects
only CPU activity. Specifying the -A flag is equivalent to
specifying -bBdqrRSvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n ALL -u ALL -P
ALL.</p>

<p>The default version of the sar command (CPU utilization
report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs
to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors
major system resources. If CPU uti- lization is near 100
percent (user + nice + system), the workload sam- pled is
CPU-bound.</p>

<p>If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it
is convenient to specify an output file for the sar command.
Run the sar command as a background process. The syntax for
this is:</p>

<p>sar -o datafile interval count &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
&amp;</p>

<p>All data is captured in binary form and saved to a file
(datafile). The data can then be selectively displayed with
the sar command using the -f option. Set the interval and
count parameters to select count records at interval second
intervals. If the count parameter is not set, all the
records saved in the file will be selected. Collection of
data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage
over a period of time and determine peak usage hours.</p>

<p>Note: The sar command only reports on local
activities.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -A This is equivalent to specifying
-bBdqrRSuvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -n ALL -u ALL -P ALL.</p>

<p>-b Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. The
following values are displayed:</p>

<p>tps Total number of transfers per second that were
issued to physical devices. A transfer is an I/O request to
a physical device. Multiple logical requests can be com-
bined into a single I/O request to the device. A trans- fer
is of indeterminate size.</p>

<p>rtps Total number of read requests per second issued to
physi- cal devices.</p>

<p>wtps Total number of write requests per second issued to
phys- ical devices.</p>

<p>bread/s Total amount of data read from the devices in
blocks per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors with 2.4
ker- nels and newer and therefore have a size of 512 bytes.
With older kernels, a block is of indeterminate size.</p>

<p>bwrtn/s Total amount of data written to devices in
blocks per second.</p>

<p>-B Report paging statistics. Some of the metrics below
are avail- able only with post 2.5 kernels. The following
values are dis- played:</p>

<p>pgpgin/s Total number of kilobytes the system paged in
from disk per second. Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this
value is a number of blocks per second (and not
kilobytes).</p>

<p>pgpgout/s Total number of kilobytes the system paged out
to disk per second. Note: With old kernels (2.2.x) this
value is a number of blocks per second (and not
kilobytes).</p>

<p>fault/s Number of page faults (major + minor) made by
the system per second. This is not a count of page faults
that gen- erate I/O, because some page faults can be
resolved with- out I/O.</p>

<p>majflt/s Number of major faults the system has made per
second, those which have required loading a memory page from
disk.</p>

<p>pgfree/s Number of pages placed on the free list by the
system per second.</p>

<p>pgscank/s Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon
per second.</p>

<p>pgscand/s Number of pages scanned directly per
second.</p>

<p>pgsteal/s Number of pages the system has reclaimed from
cache (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its
mem- ory demands.</p>

<p>%vmeff Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric
of the efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then
almost every page coming off the tail of the inactive list
is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less than 30%)
then the virtual memory is having some difficulty. This
field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned
during the interval of time.</p>

<p>-C When reading data from a file, tell sar to display
comments that have been inserted by sadc.</p>

<p>-d Report activity for each block device (kernels 2.4
and newer only). When data is displayed, the device
specification dev m-n is generally used ( DEV column). m is
the major number of the device. With recent kernels (post
2.5), n is the minor number of the device, but is only a
sequence number with pre 2.5 ker- nels. Device names may
also be pretty-printed if option -p is used or persistent
device names can be printed if option -j is used (see
below). Values for fields avgqu-sz, await, svctm and %util
may be unavailable and displayed as 0.00 with some 2.4
kernels. Note that disk activity depends on sadc options
&quot;-S DISK&quot; and &quot;-S XDISK&quot; to be
collected. The following values are displayed:</p>

<p>tps Indicate the number of transfers per second that
were issued to the device. Multiple logical requests can be
combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer
is of indeterminate size.</p>

<p>rd_sec/s Number of sectors read from the device. The
size of a sector is 512 bytes.</p>

<p>wr_sec/s Number of sectors written to the device. The
size of a sector is 512 bytes.</p>

<p>avgrq-sz The average size (in sectors) of the requests
that were issued to the device.</p>

<p>avgqu-sz The average queue length of the requests that
were issued to the device.</p>

<p>await The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O
requests issued to the device to be served. This includes
the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent
servic- ing them.</p>

<p>svctm The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O
requests that were issued to the device.</p>

<p>%util Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O
requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization
for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is
close to 100%.</p>

<p>-e [ hh:mm:ss ] Set the ending time of the report. The
default ending time is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in
24-hour format. This option can be used when data are read
from or written to a file (options -f or -o ).</p>

<p>-f [ filename ] Extract records from filename (created
by the -o filename flag). The default value of the filename
parameter is the current daily data file, the
/var/log/sa/sadd file. The -f option is exclusive of the -o
option.</p>

<p>-h Display a short help message then exit.</p>

<p>-i interval Select data records at seconds as close as
possible to the num- ber specified by the interval
parameter.</p>

<p>-I { int [,...] | SUM | ALL | XALL } Report statistics
for a given interrupt. int is the interrupt number.
Specifying multiple -I int parameters on the command line
will look at multiple independent interrupts. The SUM key-
word indicates that the total number of interrupts received
per second is to be displayed. The ALL keyword indicates
that statistics from the first 16 interrupts are to be
reported, whereas the XALL keyword indicates that statistics
from all interrupts, including potential APIC interrupt
sources, are to be reported. Note that interrupt statistics
depend on sadc option &quot;-S INT&quot; to be
collected.</p>

<p>-j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } Display persistent
device names. Use this option in conjunction with option -d.
Options ID, LABEL, etc. specify the type of the persistent
name. These options are not limited, only prerequi- site is
that directory with required persistent names is present in
/dev/disk. If persistent name is not found for the device,
the device name is pretty-printed (see option -p below).</p>

<p>--legacy Enable reading older /var/log/sa/sadd data
files. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3, the sysstat package
was updated to version 9.0.4-20. This update changed the
format of /var/log/sa/sadd data files, but unfortunately,
the format version was not updated. Because of this, sysstat
did not restrict reading of data files in old format and
while interpreting them, some dis- played values could have
been incorrect. The updated sysstat package in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.5 contains fixed format version of data
files and prevents reading data files created by older
sysstat packages. However, data files created by the sys-
stat packages from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 and 6.4 are
fully compatible with the sysstat package from Red Hat
Enter- prise Linux 6.5. To enable latest sysstat to read
older data files, use this option. Note that this option
allows you to read also data files created on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.2 and ear- lier, however, these files are
not compatible with the latest sysstat package.</p>

<p>-m Report power management statistics. Note that these
statistics depend on sadc option &quot;-S POWER&quot; to be
collected. The following value is displayed:</p>

<p>MHz CPU clock frequency in MHz.</p>

<p>-n { keyword [,...] | ALL } Report network
statistics.</p>

<p>Possible keywords are DEV, EDEV, NFS, NFSD, SOCK, IP,

deliv- ered per second to IP user-protocols (including ICMP)
[ipInDelivers].</p>

<p>orq/s The total number of IP datagrams which local IP

second due to errors in their IP headers, including bad
checksums, ver- sion number mismatch, other format errors,
time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their
IP options, etc. [ipInHdrErrors]</p>

<p>iadrerr/s The number of input datagrams discarded per
second because the IP address in their IP headers
destination field was not a valid address to be received at
this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g.,
0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class
E). For entities which are not IP routers and therefore do
not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams
discarded because the destination address was not a local
address [ipInAddrErrors].</p>

<p>iukwnpr/s The number of locally-addressed datagrams
received suc- cessfully but discarded per second because of
an unknown or unsupported protocol [ipInUnknownProtos].</p>

<p>idisc/s The number of input IP datagrams per second for

lack of buffer space) [ipInDiscards]. Note that this counter
does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting
re-assembly.</p>

<p>odisc/s The number of output IP datagrams per second for
which no problem was encountered to prevent their
transmission to their destination, but which were discarded

any such packets met this (discretionary) discard crite-
rion.</p>

because no route could be found to transmit them to their
desti- nation [ipOutNoRoutes]. Note that this counter
includes any packets counted in fwddgm/s which meet this no-
route criterion. Note that this includes any datagrams which
a host cannot route because all of its default routers are
down.</p>

<p>asmf/s The number of failures detected per second by the
IP re- assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out,
errors, etc) [ipReasmFails]. Note that this is not nec-
essarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some
algorithms can lose track of the number of fragments by
combining them as they are received.</p>

discarded per second because they needed to be fragmented at
this entity but could not be, e.g., because their Dont Frag-
ment flag was set [ipFragFails].</p>

<p>With the EIP6 keyword, statistics about IPv6 network
errors are reported. Note that IPv6 statistics depend on
sadc option &quot;-S IPV6&quot; to be collected. The
following values are displayed (for- mal SNMP names between
square brackets):</p>

<p>ihdrer6/s The number of input datagrams discarded per
second due to errors in their IPv6 headers, including
version number mismatch, other format errors, hop count
exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IPv6
options, etc. [ipv6IfStatsInHdrErrors]</p>

<p>iadrer6/s The number of input datagrams discarded per
second because the IPv6 address in their IPv6 headers
destina- tion field was not a valid address to be received
at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g.,
::0) and unsupported addresses (e.g., addresses with unallo-
cated prefixes). For entities which are not IPv6 routers and
therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes
datagrams discarded because the destination address was not
a local address [ipv6IfStatsInAddr- Errors].</p>

<p>iukwnp6/s The number of locally-addressed datagrams
received suc- cessfully but discarded per second because of
an unknown or unsupported protocol
[ipv6IfStatsInUnknownProtos].</p>

<p>i2big6/s The number of input datagrams that could not be
forwarded per second because their size exceeded the link
MTU of outgoing interface [ipv6IfStatsInTooBigErrors].</p>

<p>idisc6/s The number of input IPv6 datagrams per second
for which no problems were encountered to prevent their
continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for
lack of buffer space) [ipv6IfStatsInDiscards]. Note that
this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while
awaiting re-assembly.</p>

<p>odisc6/s The number of output IPv6 datagrams per second
for which no problem was encountered to prevent their
transmission to their destination, but which were discarded
(e.g., for lack of buffer space) [ipv6IfStatsOutDiscards].
Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in
fwddgm6/s if any such packets met this (discretionary)
discard cri- terion.</p>

<p>inort6/s The number of input datagrams discarded per
second because no route could be found to transmit them to
their destination [ipv6IfStatsInNoRoutes].</p>

<p>onort6/s The number of locally generated IP datagrams
discarded per second because no route could be found to
transmit them to their destination [unknown formal SNMP
name].</p>

<p>asmf6/s The number of failures detected per second by
the IPv6 re-assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed
out, errors, etc.) [ipv6IfStatsReasmFails]. Note that this
is not necessarily a count of discarded IPv6 fragments since
some algorithms can lose track of the number of fragments by
combining them as they are received.</p>

<p>fragf6/s The number of IPv6 datagrams that have been
discarded per second because they needed to be fragmented at
this out- put interface but could not be
[ipv6IfStatsOutFragFails].</p>

<p>The ALL keyword is equivalent to specifying all the
keywords above and therefore all the network activities are
reported.</p>

<p>-o [ filename ] Save the readings in the file in binary
form. Each reading is in a separate record. The default
value of the filename parameter is the current daily data
file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file. The -o option is exclusive
of the -f option. All the data available from the kernel are
saved in the file (in fact, sar calls its data collector
sadc with the option &quot;-S ALL&quot;. See sadc(8) manual
page).</p>

<p>-P { cpu [,...] | ALL } Report per-processor statistics
for the specified processor or processors. Specifying the
ALL keyword reports statistics for each individual
processor, and globally for all processors. Note that
processor 0 is the first processor.</p>

<p>-p Pretty-print device names. Use this option in
conjunction with option -d. By default names are printed as
dev m-n where m and n are the major and minor numbers for
the device. Use of this option displays the names of the
devices as they (should) appear in /dev. Name mappings are
controlled by /etc/sysconfig/sys- stat.ioconf.</p>

<p>-q Report queue length and load averages. The following
values are displayed:</p>

<p>runq-sz Run queue length (number of tasks waiting for
run time).</p>

<p>plist-sz Number of tasks in the task list.</p>

<p>ldavg-1 System load average for the last minute. The
load aver- age is calculated as the average number of
runnable or running tasks (R state), and the number of tasks
in unin- terruptible sleep (D state) over the specified
interval.</p>

<p>ldavg-5 System load average for the past 5 minutes.</p>

<p>ldavg-15 System load average for the past 15
minutes.</p>

<p>-r Report memory utilization statistics. The following
values are displayed:</p>

<p>kbmemfree Amount of free memory available in
kilobytes.</p>

<p>kbmemused Amount of used memory in kilobytes. This does
not take into account memory used by the kernel itself.</p>

<p>%memused Percentage of used memory.</p>

<p>kbbuffers Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel
in kilo- bytes.</p>

<p>kbcached Amount of memory used to cache data by the
kernel in kilobytes.</p>

<p>kbcommit Amount of memory in kilobytes needed for
current work- load. This is an estimate of how much RAM/swap
is needed to guarantee that there never is out of
memory.</p>

<p>%commit Percentage of memory needed for current workload
in rela- tion to the total amount of memory (RAM+swap). This
num- ber may be greater than 100% because the kernel usually
overcommits memory.</p>

<p>-R Report memory statistics. The following values are
displayed:</p>

<p>frmpg/s Number of memory pages freed by the system per
second. A negative value represents a number of pages
allocated by the system. Note that a page has a size of 4 kB
or 8 kB according to the machine architecture.</p>

<p>bufpg/s Number of additional memory pages used as
buffers by the system per second. A negative value means
fewer pages used as buffers by the system.</p>

<p>campg/s Number of additional memory pages cached by the
system per second. A negative value means fewer pages in the
cache.</p>

<p>-s [ hh:mm:ss ] Set the starting time of the data,
causing the sar command to extract records time-tagged at,
or following, the time speci- fied. The default starting
time is 08:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format.
This option can be used only when data are read from a file
(option -f ).</p>

<p>-S Report swap space utilization statistics. The
following values are displayed:</p>

<p>kbswpfree Amount of free swap space in kilobytes.</p>

<p>kbswpused Amount of used swap space in kilobytes.</p>

<p>%swpused Percentage of used swap space.</p>

<p>kbswpcad Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes. This
is mem- ory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in
but still also is in the swap area (if memory is needed it
doesn t need to be swapped out again because it is already
in the swap area. This saves I/O).</p>

<p>%swpcad Percentage of cached swap memory in relation to
the amount of used swap space.</p>

<p>-t When reading data from a daily data file, indicate
that sar should display the timestamps in the original
locale time of the data file creator. Without this option,
the sar command displays the timestamps in the users locale
time.</p>

<p>-u [ ALL ] Report CPU utilization. The ALL keyword
indicates that all the CPU fields should be displayed. The
report may show the follow- ing fields:</p>

<p>%user Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
execut- ing at the user level (application). Note that this
field includes time spent running virtual processors.</p>

<p>%usr Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
execut- ing at the user level (application). Note that this
field does NOT include time spent running virtual
processors.</p>

<p>%nice Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
execut- ing at the user level with nice priority.</p>

<p>%system Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred
while execut- ing at the system level (kernel). Note that
this field includes time spent servicing hardware and
software interrupts.</p>

<p>%sys Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
execut- ing at the system level (kernel). Note that this
field does NOT include time spent servicing hardware or
soft- ware interrupts.</p>

<p>%iowait Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were
idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p>%steal Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by
the vir- tual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing
another virtual processor.</p>

<p>%irq Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to
service hardware interrupts.</p>

<p>%soft Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to
service software interrupts.</p>

<p>%guest Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to
run a vir- tual processor.</p>

<p>%idle Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O
request.</p>

<p>Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any
activ- ity at all (0.00 for every field) is a disabled
(offline) pro- cessor.</p>

<p>-v Report status of inode, file and other kernel tables.
The fol- lowing values are displayed:</p>

<p>dentunusd Number of unused cache entries in the
directory cache.</p>

<p>file-nr Number of file handles used by the system.</p>

<p>inode-nr Number of inode handlers used by the
system.</p>

<p>pty-nr Number of pseudo-terminals used by the
system.</p>

<p>-V Print version number then exit.</p>

<p>-w Report task creation and system switching
activity.</p>

<p>proc/s Total number of tasks created per second.</p>

<p>cswch/s Total number of context switches per second.</p>

<p>-W Report swapping statistics. The following values are
displayed:</p>

<p>pswpin/s Total number of swap pages the system brought
in per sec- ond.</p>

<p>pswpout/s Total number of swap pages the system brought
out per second.</p>

<p>-y Report TTY device activity. The following values are
displayed:</p>

<p>rcvin/s Number of receive interrupts per second for
current serial line. Serial line number is given in the TTY
col- umn.</p>

<p>xmtin/s Number of transmit interrupts per second for
current serial line.</p>

<p>framerr/s Number of frame errors per second for current
serial line.</p>

<p>prtyerr/s Number of parity errors per second for current
serial line.</p>

<p>brk/s Number of breaks per second for current serial
line.</p>

<p>ovrun/s Number of overrun errors per second for current
serial line.</p>

<p>Note that with recent 2.6 kernels, these statistics can
be retrieved only by root.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The sar command takes into account the
following environment variables:</p>

<p>S_TIME_FORMAT If this variable exists and its value is
ISO then the current locale will be ignored when printing
the date in the report header. The sar command will use the
ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM- DD) instead.</p>

<p>S_TIME_DEF_TIME If this variable exists and its value is
UTC then sar will save its data in UTC time (data will still
be displayed in local time). sar will also use UTC time
instead of local time to determine the current daily data
file located in the /var/log/sa directory. This variable may
be useful for servers with users located across several
timezones.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES sar -u 2 5 Report CPU utilization for each 2
seconds. 5 lines are dis- played.</p>

<p>sar -I 14 -o int14.file 2 10 Report statistics on IRQ 14
for each 2 seconds. 10 lines are displayed. Data are stored
in a file called int14.file.</p>

<p>sar -r -n DEV -f /var/log/sa/sa16 Display memory and
network statistics saved in daily data file sa16.</p>

<p>sar -A Display all the statistics saved in current daily
data file.</p>

<p>BUGS /proc filesystem must be mounted for the sar
command to work.</p>

<p>All the statistics are not necessarily available,
depending on the ker- nel version used.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/sa/sadd Indicate the daily data file,
where the dd parameter is a number representing the day of
the month.</p>

<p>/proc contains various files with system statistics.</p>
