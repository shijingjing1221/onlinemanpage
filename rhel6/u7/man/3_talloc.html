<p>TALLOC(3) [FIXME: manual] TALLOC(3)</p>

<p>NAME talloc - hierarchical reference counted memory pool
system with destructors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;talloc.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If you are used to talloc from Samba3 then
please read this carefully, as talloc has changed a lot.</p>

<p>The new talloc is a hierarchical, reference counted
memory pool system with destructors. Quite a mouthful
really, but not too bad once you get used to it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest change from Samba3 is that there is
no distinction between a &quot;talloc context&quot; and a
&quot;talloc pointer&quot;. Any pointer returned from
talloc() is itself a valid talloc context. This means you
can do this:</p>

<p>struct foo *X = talloc(mem_ctx, struct foo); X-&gt;name
= talloc_strdup(X, &quot;foo&quot;);</p>

<p>and the pointer X-&gt;name would be a &quot;child&quot;
of the talloc context X which is itself a child of mem_ctx.
So if you do talloc_free(mem_ctx) then it is all destroyed,
whereas if you do talloc_free(X) then just X and X-&gt;name
are destroyed, and if you do talloc_free(X-&gt;name) then
just the name element of X is destroyed.</p>

<p>If you think about this, then what this effectively
gives you is an n-ary tree, where you can free any part of
the tree with talloc_free().</p>

<p>If you find this confusing, then I suggest you run the
testsuite program to watch talloc in action. You may also
like to add your own tests to testsuite.c to clarify how
some particular situation is handled.</p>

<p>TALLOC API The following is a complete guide to the
talloc API. Read it all at least twice.</p>

<p>(type *)talloc(const void *ctx, type); The talloc()
macro is the core of the talloc library. It takes a memory
ctx and a type, and returns a pointer to a new area of
memory of the given type.</p>

<p>The returned pointer is itself a talloc context, so you
can use it as the ctx argument to more calls to talloc() if
you wish.</p>

<p>The returned pointer is a &quot;child&quot; of the
supplied context. This means that if you talloc_free() the
ctx then the new child disappears as well. Alternatively you
can free just the child.</p>

<p>The ctx argument to talloc() can be NULL, in which case
a new top level context is created.</p>

<p>void *talloc_size(const void *ctx, size_t size); The
function talloc_size() should be used when you don&acute;t
have a convenient type to pass to talloc(). Unlike talloc(),
it is not type safe (as it returns a void *), so you are on
your own for type checking.</p>

<p>(typeof(ptr)) talloc_ptrtype(const void *ctx, ptr); The
talloc_ptrtype() macro should be used when you have a
pointer and want to allocate memory to point at with this
pointer. When compiling with gcc &gt;= 3 it is typesafe.
Note this is a wrapper of talloc_size() and
talloc_get_name() will return the current location in the
source file. and not the type.</p>

<p>int talloc_free(void *ptr); The talloc_free() function
frees a piece of talloc memory, and all its children. You
can call talloc_free() on any pointer returned by
talloc().</p>

<p>The return value of talloc_free() indicates success or
failure, with 0 returned for success and -1 for failure. The
only possible failure condition is if ptr had a destructor
attached to it and the destructor returned -1. See
talloc_set_destructor() for details on destructors.</p>

<p>If this pointer has an additional parent when
talloc_free() is called then the memory is not actually
released, but instead the most recently established parent
is destroyed. See talloc_reference() for details on
establishing additional parents.</p>

<p>For more control on which parent is removed, see
talloc_unlink().</p>

<p>talloc_free() operates recursively on its children.</p>

<p>From the 2.0 version of talloc, as a special case,
talloc_free() is refused on pointers that have more than one
parent, as talloc would have no way of knowing which parent
should be removed. To free a pointer that has more than one
parent please use talloc_unlink().</p>

<p>To help you find problems in your code caused by this
behaviour, if you do try and free a pointer with more than
one parent then the talloc logging function will be called
to give output like this:</p>

<p>ERROR: talloc_free with references at
some_dir/source/foo.c:123 reference at
some_dir/source/other.c:325 reference at
some_dir/source/third.c:121</p>

<p>Please see the documentation for talloc_set_log_fn() and
talloc_set_log_stderr() for more information on talloc
logging functions.</p>

<p>void *talloc_reference(const void *ctx, const void
*ptr); The talloc_reference() function makes ctx an
additional parent of ptr.</p>

<p>The return value of talloc_reference() is always the
original pointer ptr, unless talloc ran out of memory in
creating the reference in which case it will return NULL
(each additional reference consumes around 48 bytes of
memory on intel x86 platforms).</p>

<p>If ptr is NULL, then the function is a no-op, and simply
returns NULL.</p>

<p>After creating a reference you can free it in one of the
following ways:</p>

<p>&middot; you can talloc_free() any parent of the
original pointer. That will reduce the number of parents of
this pointer by 1, and will cause this pointer to be freed
if it runs out of parents.</p>

<p>&middot; you can talloc_free() the pointer itself. That
will destroy the most recently established parent to the
pointer and leave the pointer as a child of its current
parent.</p>

<p>For more control on which parent to remove, see
talloc_unlink().</p>

<p>int talloc_unlink(const void *ctx, const void *ptr); The
talloc_unlink() function removes a specific parent from ptr.
The ctx passed must either be a context used in
talloc_reference() with this pointer, or must be a direct
parent of ptr.</p>

<p>Note that if the parent has already been removed using
talloc_free() then this function will fail and will return
-1. Likewise, if ptr is NULL, then the function will make no
modifications and return -1.</p>

<p>Usually you can just use talloc_free() instead of
talloc_unlink(), but sometimes it is useful to have the
additional control on which parent is removed.</p>

<p>void talloc_set_destructor(const void *ptr, int
(*destructor)(void *)); The function talloc_set_destructor()
sets the destructor for the pointer ptr. A destructor is a
function that is called when the memory used by a pointer is
about to be released. The destructor receives ptr as an
argument, and should return 0 for success and -1 for
failure.</p>

<p>The destructor can do anything it wants to, including
freeing other pieces of memory. A common use for destructors
is to clean up operating system resources (such as open file
descriptors) contained in the structure the destructor is
placed on.</p>

<p>You can only place one destructor on a pointer. If you
need more than one destructor then you can create a
zero-length child of the pointer and place an additional
destructor on that.</p>

<p>To remove a destructor call talloc_set_destructor() with
NULL for the destructor.</p>

<p>If your destructor attempts to talloc_free() the pointer
that it is the destructor for then talloc_free() will return
-1 and the free will be ignored. This would be a pointless
operation anyway, as the destructor is only called when the
memory is just about to go away.</p>

<p>int talloc_increase_ref_count(const void *ptr); The
talloc_increase_ref_count(ptr) function is exactly
equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_reference(NULL, ptr);</p>

<p>You can use either syntax, depending on which you think
is clearer in your code.</p>

<p>It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.</p>

<p>size_t talloc_reference_count(const void *ptr); Return
the number of references to the pointer.</p>

<p>void talloc_set_name(const void *ptr, const char *fmt,
...); Each talloc pointer has a &quot;name&quot;. The name
is used principally for debugging purposes, although it is
also possible to set and get the name on a pointer in as a
way of &quot;marking&quot; pointers in your code.</p>

<p>The main use for names on pointer is for &quot;talloc
reports&quot;. See talloc_report_depth_cb(),
talloc_report_depth_file(), talloc_report() talloc_report()
and talloc_report_full() for details. Also see
talloc_enable_leak_report() and
talloc_enable_leak_report_full().</p>

<p>The talloc_set_name() function allocates memory as a
child of the pointer. It is logically equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_set_name_const(ptr, talloc_asprintf(ptr, fmt,
...));</p>

<p>Note that multiple calls to talloc_set_name() will
allocate more memory without releasing the name. All of the
memory is released when the ptr is freed using
talloc_free().</p>

<p>void talloc_set_name_const(const void *ptr, const char
*name); The function talloc_set_name_const() is just like
talloc_set_name(), but it takes a string constant, and is
much faster. It is extensively used by the &quot;auto
naming&quot; macros, such as talloc_p().</p>

<p>This function does not allocate any memory. It just
copies the supplied pointer into the internal representation
of the talloc ptr. This means you must not pass a name
pointer to memory that will disappear before ptr is freed
with talloc_free().</p>

<p>void *talloc_named(const void *ctx, size_t size, const
char *fmt, ...); The talloc_named() function creates a named
talloc pointer. It is equivalent to:</p>

<p>ptr = talloc_size(ctx, size); talloc_set_name(ptr, fmt,
....);</p>

<p>void *talloc_named_const(const void *ctx, size_t size,
const char *name); This is equivalent to:</p>

<p>ptr = talloc_size(ctx, size); talloc_set_name_const(ptr,
name);</p>

<p>const char *talloc_get_name(const void *ptr); This
returns the current name for the given talloc pointer, ptr.
See talloc_set_name() for details.</p>

<p>void *talloc_init(const char *fmt, ...); This function
creates a zero length named talloc context as a top level
context. It is equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_named(NULL, 0, fmt, ...);</p>

<p>void *talloc_new(void *ctx); This is a utility macro
that creates a new memory context hanging off an existing
context, automatically naming it &quot;talloc_new:
__location__&quot; where __location__ is the source line it
is called from. It is particularly useful for creating a new
temporary working context.</p>

<p>(type *)talloc_realloc(const void *ctx, void *ptr, type,
count); The talloc_realloc() macro changes the size of a
talloc pointer. It has the following equivalences:</p>

<p>talloc_realloc(ctx, NULL, type, 1) ==&gt; talloc(ctx,
type); talloc_realloc(ctx, ptr, type, 0) ==&gt;
talloc_free(ptr);</p>

<p>The ctx argument is only used if ptr is not NULL,
otherwise it is ignored.</p>

<p>talloc_realloc() returns the new pointer, or NULL on
failure. The call will fail either due to a lack of memory,
or because the pointer has more than one parent (see
talloc_reference()).</p>

<p>void *talloc_realloc_size(const void *ctx, void *ptr,
size_t size); the talloc_realloc_size() function is useful
when the type is not known so the type-safe talloc_realloc()
cannot be used.</p>

<p>TYPE *talloc_steal(const void *new_ctx, const TYPE
*ptr); The talloc_steal() function changes the parent
context of a talloc pointer. It is typically used when the
context that the pointer is currently a child of is going to
be freed and you wish to keep the memory for a longer
time.</p>

<p>The talloc_steal() function returns the pointer that you
pass it. It does not have any failure modes.</p>

<p>It is possible to produce loops in the parent/child
relationship if you are not careful with talloc_steal(). No
guarantees are provided as to your sanity or the safety of
your data if you do this.</p>

<p>Note that if you try and call talloc_steal() on a
pointer that has more than one parent then the result is
ambiguous. Talloc will choose to remove the parent that is
currently indicated by talloc_parent() and replace it with
the chosen parent. You will also get a message like this via
the talloc logging functions:</p>

<p>WARNING: talloc_steal with references at
some_dir/source/foo.c:123 reference at
some_dir/source/other.c:325 reference at
some_dir/source/third.c:121</p>

<p>To unambiguously change the parent of a pointer please
see the function talloc_reparent() . See the
talloc_set_log_fn() documentation for more information on
talloc logging.</p>

<p>TYPE *talloc_reparent(const void *old_parent, const void
*new_parent, const TYPE *ptr); The talloc_reparent()
function changes the parent context of a talloc pointer. It
is typically used when the context that the pointer is
currently a child of is going to be freed and you wish to
keep the memory for a longer time.</p>

<p>The talloc_reparent() function returns the pointer that
you pass it. It does not have any failure modes.</p>

<p>The difference between talloc_reparent() and
talloc_steal() is that talloc_reparent() can specify which
parent you wish to change. This is useful when a pointer has
multiple parents via references.</p>

<p>TYPE *talloc_move(const void *new_ctx, TYPE **ptr); The
talloc_move() function is a wrapper around talloc_steal()
which zeros the source pointer after the move. This avoids a
potential source of bugs where a programmer leaves a pointer
in two structures, and uses the pointer from the old
structure after it has been moved to a new one.</p>

<p>size_t talloc_total_size(const void *ptr); The
talloc_total_size() function returns the total size in bytes
used by this pointer and all child pointers. Mostly useful
for debugging.</p>

<p>Passing NULL is allowed, but it will only give a
meaningful result if talloc_enable_leak_report() or
talloc_enable_leak_report_full() has been called.</p>

<p>size_t talloc_total_blocks(const void *ptr); The
talloc_total_blocks() function returns the total memory
block count used by this pointer and all child pointers.
Mostly useful for debugging.</p>

<p>Passing NULL is allowed, but it will only give a
meaningful result if talloc_enable_leak_report() or
talloc_enable_leak_report_full() has been called.</p>

<p>void talloc_report(const void *ptr, FILE *f); The
talloc_report() function prints a summary report of all
memory used by ptr. One line of report is printed for each
immediate child of ptr, showing the total memory and number
of blocks used by that child.</p>

<p>You can pass NULL for the pointer, in which case a
report is printed for the top level memory context, but only
if talloc_enable_leak_report() or
talloc_enable_leak_report_full() has been called.</p>

<p>void talloc_report_full(const void *ptr, FILE *f); This
provides a more detailed report than talloc_report(). It
will recursively print the entire tree of memory referenced
by the pointer. References in the tree are shown by giving
the name of the pointer that is referenced.</p>

<p>You can pass NULL for the pointer, in which case a
report is printed for the top level memory context, but only
if talloc_enable_leak_report() or
talloc_enable_leak_report_full() has been called.</p>

<p>void talloc_report_depth_cb(const void *ptr, int depth,
int max_depth, void (*callback)(const void *ptr, int depth,
int max_depth, int is_ref, void *priv), void *priv);</p>

<p>This provides a more flexible reports than
talloc_report(). It will recursively call the callback for
the entire tree of memory referenced by the pointer.
References in the tree are passed with is_ref = 1 and the
pointer that is referenced.</p>

<p>You can pass NULL for the pointer, in which case a
report is printed for the top level memory context, but only
if talloc_enable_leak_report() or
talloc_enable_leak_report_full() has been called.</p>

<p>The recursion is stopped when depth &gt;= max_depth.
max_depth = -1 means only stop at leaf nodes.</p>

<p>void talloc_report_depth_file(const void *ptr, int
depth, int max_depth, FILE *f);</p>

<p>This provides a more flexible reports than
talloc_report(). It will let you specify the depth and
max_depth.</p>

<p>void talloc_enable_leak_report(void); This enables
calling of talloc_report(NULL, stderr) when the program
exits. In Samba4 this is enabled by using the --leak-report
command line option.</p>

<p>For it to be useful, this function must be called before
any other talloc function as it establishes a &quot;null
context&quot; that acts as the top of the tree. If you
don&acute;t call this function first then passing NULL to
talloc_report() or talloc_report_full() won&acute;t give you
the full tree printout.</p>

<p>Here is a typical talloc report:</p>

<p>talloc report on &acute;null_context&acute; (total 267
bytes in 15 blocks) libcli/auth/spnego_parse.c:55 contains
31 bytes in 2 blocks libcli/auth/spnego_parse.c:55 contains
31 bytes in 2 blocks iconv(UTF8,CP850) contains 42 bytes in
2 blocks libcli/auth/spnego_parse.c:55 contains 31 bytes in
2 blocks iconv(CP850,UTF8) contains 42 bytes in 2 blocks
iconv(UTF8,UTF-16LE) contains 45 bytes in 2 blocks
iconv(UTF-16LE,UTF8) contains 45 bytes in 2 blocks</p>

<p>void talloc_enable_leak_report_full(void); This enables
calling of talloc_report_full(NULL, stderr) when the program
exits. In Samba4 this is enabled by using the
--leak-report-full command line option.</p>

<p>For it to be useful, this function must be called before
any other talloc function as it establishes a &quot;null
context&quot; that acts as the top of the tree. If you
don&acute;t call this function first then passing NULL to
talloc_report() or talloc_report_full() won&acute;t give you
the full tree printout.</p>

<p>Here is a typical full report:</p>

<p>full talloc report on &acute;root&acute; (total 18 bytes
in 8 blocks) p1 contains 18 bytes in 7 blocks (ref 0) r1
contains 13 bytes in 2 blocks (ref 0) reference to: p2 p2
contains 1 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 1) x3 contains 1 bytes in
1 blocks (ref 0) x2 contains 1 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0) x1
contains 1 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)</p>

<p>(type *)talloc_zero(const void *ctx, type); The
talloc_zero() macro is equivalent to:</p>

<p>ptr = talloc(ctx, type); if (ptr) memset(ptr, 0,
sizeof(type));</p>

<p>void *talloc_zero_size(const void *ctx, size_t size) The
talloc_zero_size() function is useful when you don&acute;t
have a known type.</p>

<p>void *talloc_memdup(const void *ctx, const void *p,
size_t size); The talloc_memdup() function is equivalent
to:</p>

<p>ptr = talloc_size(ctx, size); if (ptr) memcpy(ptr, p,
size);</p>

<p>char *talloc_strdup(const void *ctx, const char *p); The
talloc_strdup() function is equivalent to:</p>

<p>ptr = talloc_size(ctx, strlen(p)+1); if (ptr)
memcpy(ptr, p, strlen(p)+1);</p>

<p>This function sets the name of the new pointer to the
passed string. This is equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_set_name_const(ptr, ptr)</p>

<p>char *talloc_strndup(const void *t, const char *p,
size_t n); The talloc_strndup() function is the talloc
equivalent of the C library function strndup(3).</p>

<p>This function sets the name of the new pointer to the
passed string. This is equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_set_name_const(ptr, ptr)</p>

<p>char *talloc_vasprintf(const void *t, const char *fmt,
va_list ap); The talloc_vasprintf() function is the talloc
equivalent of the C library function vasprintf(3).</p>

<p>This function sets the name of the new pointer to the
new string. This is equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_set_name_const(ptr, ptr)</p>

<p>char *talloc_asprintf(const void *t, const char *fmt,
...); The talloc_asprintf() function is the talloc
equivalent of the C library function asprintf(3).</p>

<p>This function sets the name of the new pointer to the
passed string. This is equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_set_name_const(ptr, ptr)</p>

<p>char *talloc_asprintf_append(char *s, const char *fmt,
...); The talloc_asprintf_append() function appends the
given formatted string to the given string.</p>

<p>This function sets the name of the new pointer to the
new string. This is equivalent to:</p>

<p>talloc_set_name_const(ptr, ptr)</p>

<p>(type *)talloc_array(const void *ctx, type, unsigned int
count); The talloc_array() macro is equivalent to:</p>

<p>(type *)talloc_size(ctx, sizeof(type) * count);</p>

<p>except that it provides integer overflow protection for
the multiply, returning NULL if the multiply overflows.</p>

<p>void *talloc_array_size(const void *ctx, size_t size,
unsigned int count); The talloc_array_size() function is
useful when the type is not known. It operates in the same
way as talloc_array(), but takes a size instead of a
type.</p>

<p>(typeof(ptr)) talloc_array_ptrtype(const void *ctx, ptr,
unsigned int count); The talloc_ptrtype() macro should be
used when you have a pointer to an array and want to
allocate memory of an array to point at with this pointer.
When compiling with gcc &gt;= 3 it is typesafe. Note this is
a wrapper of talloc_array_size() and talloc_get_name() will
return the current location in the source file. and not the
type.</p>

<p>void *talloc_realloc_fn(const void *ctx, void *ptr,
size_t size) This is a non-macro version of
talloc_realloc(), which is useful as libraries sometimes
want a realloc function pointer. A realloc(3) implementation
encapsulates the functionality of malloc(3), free(3) and
realloc(3) in one call, which is why it is useful to be able
to pass around a single function pointer.</p>

<p>void *talloc_autofree_context(void); This is a handy
utility function that returns a talloc context which will be
automatically freed on program exit. This can be used to
reduce the noise in memory leak reports.</p>

<p>void *talloc_check_name(const void *ptr, const char
*name); This function checks if a pointer has the specified
name. If it does then the pointer is returned. It it
doesn&acute;t then NULL is returned.</p>

<p>(type *)talloc_get_type(const void *ptr, type); This
macro allows you to do type checking on talloc pointers. It
is particularly useful for void* private pointers. It is
equivalent to this:</p>

<p>(type *)talloc_check_name(ptr, #type)</p>

<p>talloc_set_type(const void *ptr, type); This macro
allows you to force the name of a pointer to be a particular
type. This can be used in conjunction with talloc_get_type()
to do type checking on void* pointers.</p>

<p>It is equivalent to this:</p>

<p>talloc_set_name_const(ptr, #type)</p>

<p>talloc_set_log_fn(void (*log_fn)(const char *message));
This function sets a logging function that talloc will use
for warnings and errors. By default talloc will not print
any warnings or errors.</p>

<p>talloc_set_log_stderr(void); This sets the talloc log
function to write log messages to stderr</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE All the additional features of talloc(3)
over malloc(3) do come at a price. We have a simple
performance test in Samba4 that measures talloc() versus
malloc() performance, and it seems that talloc() is about
10% slower than malloc() on my x86 Debian Linux box. For
Samba, the great reduction in code complexity that we get by
using talloc makes this worthwhile, especially as the total
overhead of talloc/malloc in Samba is already quite
small.</p>
