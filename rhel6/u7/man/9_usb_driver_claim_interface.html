<p>NAME usb_driver_claim_interface - bind a driver to an
interface</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_driver_claim_interface(struct
usb_driver * driver, struct usb_interface * iface, void *
priv);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS driver the driver to be bound</p>

<p>iface the interface to which it will be bound; must be
in the usb device&acute;s active configuration</p>

<p>priv driver data associated with that interface</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is used by usb device drivers that need
to claim more than one interface on a device when probing
(audio and acm are current examples). No device driver
should directly modify internal usb_interface or usb_device
structure members.</p>

<p>Few drivers should need to use this routine, since the
most natural way to bind to an interface is to return the
private data from the driver&acute;s probe method.</p>

<p>Callers must own the device lock, so driver probe
entries don&acute;t need extra locking, but other call
contexts may need to explicitly claim that lock.</p>
