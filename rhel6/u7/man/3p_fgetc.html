<p>FGETC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FGETC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fgetc - get a byte from a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fgetc(FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the end-of-file indicator for the input
stream pointed to by stream is not set and a next byte is
present, the fgetc() function shall obtain the next byte as
an unsigned char converted to an int, from the input stream
pointed to by stream, and advance the associated file
position indicator for the stream (if defined). Since
fgetc() operates on bytes, reading a character consisting of
multiple bytes (or &quot;a multi-byte character&quot;) may
require multiple calls to fgetc().</p>

<p>The fgetc() function may mark the st_atime field of the
file associated with stream for update. The st_atime field
shall be marked for update by the first successful execution
of fgetc(), fgets(), fgetwc(), fgetws(), fread(), fscanf(),
getc(), getchar(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that
returns data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc() or
ungetwc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, fgetc() shall
return the next byte from the input stream pointed to by
stream. If the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set,
or if the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file
indicator for the stream shall be set and fgetc() shall
return EOF. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for
the stream shall be set, fgetc() shall return EOF, and shall
set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The fgetc() function shall fail if data needs to
be read and:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file
descriptor underlying stream and the process would be
delayed in the fgetc() opera- tion.</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is not a
valid file descriptor open for reading.</p>

<p>EINTR The read operation was terminated due to the
receipt of a sig- nal, and no data was transferred.</p>

<p>EIO A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is
in a back- ground process group attempting to read from its
controlling terminal, and either the process is ignoring or
blocking the SIGTTIN signal or the process group is
orphaned. This error may also be generated for
implementation-defined reasons.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file is a regular file and an attempt was
made to read at or beyond the offset maximum associated with
the corresponding stream.</p>

<p>The fgetc() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>ENXIO A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the
request was outside the capabilities of the device.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the integer value returned by
fgetc() is stored into a variable of type char and then
compared against the integer constant EOF, the com- parison
may never succeed, because sign-extension of a variable of
type char on widening to integer is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The ferror() or feof() functions must be used to
distinguish between an error condition and an end-of-file
condition.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
