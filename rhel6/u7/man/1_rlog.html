<p>RLOG(1) RLOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME rlog - print log messages and other information
about RCS files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rlog [ options ] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rlog prints information about RCS files.</p>

<p>Pathnames matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all
others denote working files. Names are paired as explained
in ci(1).</p>

<p>rlog prints the following information for each RCS file:
RCS pathname, working pathname, head (i.e., the number of
the latest revision on the trunk), default branch, access
list, locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number of
revisions, number of revisions selected for printing, and
descriptive text. This is followed by entries for the
selected revisions in reverse chronological order for each
branch. For each revision, rlog prints revision number,
author, date/time, state, number of lines added/deleted
(with respect to the previous revision), locker of the
revision (if any), and log message. All times are displayed
in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by default; this can be
overridden with -z. Without options, rlog prints complete
information. The options below restrict this output.</p>

<p>-L Ignore RCS files that have no locks set. This is
convenient in combination with -h, -l, and -R.</p>

<p>-R Print only the name of the RCS file. This is
convenient for trans- lating a working pathname into an RCS
pathname.</p>

<p>-h Print only the RCS pathname, working pathname, head,
default branch, access list, locks, symbolic names, and
suffix.</p>

<p>-t Print the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.</p>

<p>-N Do not print the symbolic names.</p>

<p>-b Print information about the revisions on the default
branch, nor- mally the highest branch on the trunk.</p>

<p>-ddates Print information about revisions with a checkin
date/time in the ranges given by the semicolon-separated
list of dates. A range of the form d1&lt;d2 or d2&gt;d1
selects the revisions that were deposited between d1 and d2
exclusive. A range of the form &lt;d or d&gt; selects all
revisions earlier than d. A range of the form d&lt; or &gt;d
selects all revisions dated later than d. If &lt; or &gt; is
followed by = then the ranges are inclusive, not exclusive.
A range of the form d selects the single, latest revision
dated d or earlier. The date/time strings d, d1, and d2 are
in the free format explained in co(1). Quoting is normally
necessary, especially for &lt; and &gt;. Note that the
separator is a semicolon.</p>

<p>-l[lockers] Print information about locked revisions
only. In addition, if the comma-separated list lockers of
login names is given, ignore all locks other than those held
by the lockers. For example, rlog -L -R -lwft RCS/* prints
the name of RCS files locked by the user wft.</p>

<p>-r[revisions] prints information about revisions given
in the comma-separated list revisions of revisions and
ranges. A range rev1:rev2 means revisions rev1 to rev2 on
the same branch, :rev means revisions from the beginning of
the branch up to and including rev, and rev: means revisions
starting with rev to the end of the branch contain- ing rev.
An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that
branch. A range of branches means all revisions on the
branches in that range. A branch followed by a . means the
latest revision in that branch. A bare -r with no revisions
means the latest revision on the default branch, normally
the trunk.</p>

<p>-sstates prints information about revisions whose state
attributes match one of the states given in the
comma-separated list states.</p>

<p>-w[logins] prints information about revisions checked in
by users with login names appearing in the comma-separated
list logins. If logins is omitted, the users login is
assumed.</p>

<p>-T This option has no effect; it is present for
compatibility with other RCS commands.</p>

<p>-V Print RCSs version number.</p>

<p>-Vn Emulate RCS version n when generating logs. See
co(1) for more.</p>

<p>-xsuffixes Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See
ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>rlog prints the intersection of the revisions selected
with the options -d, -l, -s, and -w, intersected with the
union of the revisions selected by -b and -r.</p>

<p>-zzone specifies the date output format, and specifies
the default time zone for date in the -ddates option. The
zone should be empty, a numeric UTC offset, or the special
string LT for local time. The default is an empty zone,
which uses the traditional RCS format of UTC without any
time zone indication and with slashes separating the parts
of the date; otherwise, times are output in ISO 8601 format
with time zone indication. For example, if local time is
January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific Standard Time, eight hours
west of UTC, then the time is output as follows:</p>

<p>option time output -z 1990/01/12 04:00:00 (default) -zLT
1990-01-11 20:00:00-08 -z+05:30 1990-01-12
09:30:00+05:30</p>

<p>EXAMPLES rlog -L -R RCS/* rlog -L -h RCS/* rlog -L -l
RCS/* rlog RCS/*</p>

<p>The first command prints the names of all RCS files in
the subdirectory RCS that have locks. The second command
prints the headers of those files, and the third prints the
headers plus the log messages of the locked revisions. The
last command prints complete information.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT RCSINIT options prepended to the argument
list, separated by spaces. See ci(1) for details.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The exit status is zero if and only if all
operations were successful.</p>

<p>BUGS The separator for revision ranges in the -r option
used to be - instead of :, but this leads to confusion when
symbolic names contain -. For backwards compatibility rlog
-r still supports the old - separator, but it warns about
this obsolete use.</p>
