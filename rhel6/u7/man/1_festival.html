<p>FESTIVAL(1) FESTIVAL(1)</p>

<p>NAME festival - a text-to-speech system.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS festival [options] [file0] [file1] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Festival is a general purpose text-to-speech
system. As well as simply rendering text as speech it can be
used in an interactive command mode for testing and
developing various aspects of speech synthesis technol-
ogy.</p>

<p>Festival has two major modes, command and tts
(text-to-speech). When in command mode input (from file or
interactively) is interpreted by the command interpreter.
When in tts mode input is rendered as speech. When in
command mode filenames that start with a left paranthesis
are treated as literal commands and evaluated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -q Load no default setup files</p>

<p>--libdir &lt;string&gt; Set library directory
pathname</p>

<p>-b Run in batch mode (no interaction)</p>

<p>--batch Run in batch mode (no interaction)</p>

<p>--tts Synthesize text in files as speech no files means
read from stdin (implies no interaction by default)</p>

mode on file and passes all other args to Scheme</p>

<p>--heap &lt;int&gt; {1000000} Set size of Lisp heap,
should not normally need to be changed from its default</p>

<p>-v Display version number and exit</p>

<p>BUGS More than you can imagine.</p>

<p>A manual with much detail (though not complete) is
available in dis- tributed as part of the system and is also
accessible at
http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/</p>

<p>Although we cannot guarantee the time required to fix
bugs, we would appreciated it if they were reported to
festival-bug@cstr.ed.ac.uk</p>
