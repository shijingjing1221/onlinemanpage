<p>IPSEC_MANUAL(8) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_MANUAL(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_manual - take manually-keyed IPsec
connections up and down</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec manual [--show] [--showonly] [--other]
[--iam address@interface] [--config configfile]
operation</p>

<p>ipsec manual [options] --union operation_part...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command was obsoleted around the same
time that Al Gore invented the internet.</p>

<p>During the jurassic period it was used to manipulates
manually-keyed Openswan IPsec connections, setting them up
and shutting them down, based on the information in the
IPsec configuration file. Normally, manually keyed
connections should not be used - automatic keying
connections</p>

<p>There are no rational reasons to use this, and it is not
supported anymore.</p>
