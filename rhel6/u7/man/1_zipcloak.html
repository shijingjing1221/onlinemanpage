<p>NAME zipcloak - encrypt entries in a zipfile</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zipcloak [-d] [-b path] [-h] [-v] [-L]
zipfile</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS zipfile Zipfile to encrypt entries in</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b path --temp-path path Use the directory given
by path for the temporary zip file.</p>

<p>-d --decrypt Decrypt encrypted entries (copy if given
wrong password).</p>

<p>-h --help Show a short help.</p>

<p>-L --license Show software license.</p>

<p>-O path --output-file zipfile Write output to new
archive zipfile, leaving original archive as is.</p>

<p>-q --quiet Quiet operation. Suppresses some

<p>DESCRIPTION zipcloak encrypts all unencrypted entries in
the zipfile. This is the default action.</p>

<p>The -d option is used to decrypt encrypted entries in
the zipfile.</p>

<p>zipcloak uses original zip encryption which is
considered weak.</p>

<p>Note: The encryption code of this program is not
copyrighted and is put in the public domain. It was
originally written in Europe and can be freely distributed
from any country including the U.S.A. (Previously if this
program was imported into the U.S.A, it could not be
re-exported from the U.S.A to another country.) See the file
README.CR included in the source distribution for more on
this. Otherwise, the Info-ZIP license applies.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To be added.</p>

<p>BUGS Large files (&gt; 2 GB) and large archives not yet
supported.</p>

<p>Split archives not yet supported. A work around is to
convert the split archive to a single-file archive using zip
and then use zipcloak on the single-file archive. If needed,
the resulting archive can then be split again using zip.</p>
