<p>QDEL(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QDEL(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qdel - delete batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qdel job_identifier ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A batch job is deleted by sending a request
to the batch server that manages the batch job. A batch job
that has been deleted is no longer subject to management by
batch services.</p>

<p>The qdel utility is a user-accessible client of batch
services that requests the deletion of one or more batch
jobs.</p>

<p>The qdel utility shall request a batch server to delete
those batch jobs for which a batch job_identifier is
presented to the utility.</p>

<p>The qdel utility shall delete batch jobs in the order in
which their batch job_identifiers are presented to the
utility.</p>

<p>If the qdel utility fails to process any batch
job_identifier success- fully, the utility shall proceed to
process the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p>The qdel utility shall delete each batch job by sending
a Delete Job Request to the batch server that manages the
batch job.</p>

<p>The qdel utility shall not exit until the batch job
corresponding to each successfully processed batch
job_identifier has been deleted.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qdel utility shall accept one or more
operands that conform to the syntax for a batch
job_identifier (see Batch Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qdel:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT An implementation of the qdel utility may write
informative messages to standard output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qdel utility shall not be required to write a
diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qdel utility waits to output the diagnostic message
while attempting to locate the job on other servers is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qdel utility allows users and
administrators to delete jobs.</p>

<p>The qdel utility provides functionality that is not
otherwise avail- able. For example, the kill utility of the
operating system does not suffice. First, to use the kill
utility, the user might have to log in on a remote node,
because the kill utility does not operate across the
network. Second, unlike qdel, kill cannot remove jobs from
queues. Lastly, the arguments of the qdel utility are job
identifiers rather than process identifiers, and so this
utility can be passed the output of the qselect utility,
thus providing users with a means of deleting a list of
jobs.</p>

<p>Because a set of jobs can be selected using the qselect
utility, the qdel utility has not been complicated with
options that provide for selection of jobs. Instead, the
batch jobs to be deleted are identified individually by
their job identifiers.</p>

<p>Historically, the qdel utility has been a component of
NQS, the exist- ing practice on which it is based. However,
the qdel utility defined in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 does not provide an option for specifying a
signal number to send to the batch job prior to the killing
of the process; that capability has been subsumed by the
qsig utility.</p>

<p>A discussion was held about the delays of networking and
the possibil- ity that the batch server may never respond,
due to a down router, down batch server, or other network
mishap. The DESCRIPTION records this under the words
&quot;fails to process any job identifier&quot;. In the
broad sense, the network problem is also an error, which
causes the failure to process the batch job identifier.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
