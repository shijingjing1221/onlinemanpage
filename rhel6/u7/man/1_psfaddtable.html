<p>NAME psfaddtable - add a Unicode character table to a
console font</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS psfaddtable fontfile tablefile outfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION psfaddtable takes a console font in .psf
format given by fontfile and merges it with the Unicode
character table given by tablefile to pro- duce a font file
with an embedded character table, which is written to
outfile. An input file name of &quot;-&quot; denotes
standard input, and an out- put file name of &quot;-&quot;
denotes standard output. If the fontfile already contains an
embedded character table, it is ignored.</p>

<p>TABLE FILE FORMAT Each line in the tablefile should be
either blank, contain a comment (preceded by #), or contain
a sequence of numbers in either decimal (default), octal
(preceded by 0), or hexadecimal (preceded by 0x) for- mat,
separated by spaces or tabs. The first number on each line
indi- cates the glyph slot in the font that is being
referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff for a 256-character
font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512-character font. Any
subsequent numbers on the same line are Uni- codes matched
by this specific glyph slot. Instead of a single Unicode one
may have a sequence of Unicodes separates by commas, to
denote that the glyph depicts the corresponding composed
symbol. It is permissible to have multiple lines for the
same glyph.</p>
