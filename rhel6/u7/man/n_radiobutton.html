<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-command
Database Name: command Database Class: Command</p>

<p>Specifies a Tcl command to associate with the button.
This com- mand is typically invoked when mouse button 1 is
released over the button window. The button s global
variable (-variable option) will be updated before the
command is invoked.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-height Database Name: height Database
Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies a desired height for the button. If an image
or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is
in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in lines of text. If this
option is not speci- fied, the buttons desired height is
computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text being
displayed in it.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-indicatoron Database Name:
indicatorOn Database Class: IndicatorOn</p>

<p>Specifies whether or not the indicator should be drawn.
Must be a proper boolean value. If false, the relief option
is ignored and the widgets relief is always sunken if the
widget is selected and raised otherwise.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-selectcolor Database Name:
selectColor Database Class: Background</p>

<p>Specifies a background color to use when the button is
selected. If indicatorOn is true then the color applies to
the indicator. Under Windows, this color is used as the
background for the indicator regardless of the select state.
If indicatorOn is false, this color is used as the
background for the entire wid- get, in place of background
or activeBackground, whenever the widget is selected. If
specified as an empty string then no special color is used
for displaying when the widget is selected.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-offrelief Database Name: offRelief
Database Class: OffRelief</p>

<p>Specifies the relief for the checkbutton when the
indicator is not drawn and the checkbutton is off. The
default value is raised. By setting this option to flat and
setting -indica- toron to false and -overrelief to raised ,
the effect is achieved of having a flat button that raises
on mouse-over and which is depressed when activated. This is
the behavior typi- cally exhibited by the Align-Left,
Align-Right, and Center radiobuttons on the toolbar of a
word-processor, for example.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-overrelief Database Name: overRelief
Database Class: OverRelief</p>

<p>Specifies an alternative relief for the radiobutton, to
be used when the mouse cursor is over the widget. This
option can be used to make toolbar buttons, by configuring
-relief flat -over- relief raised. If the value of this
option is the empty string, then no alternative relief is
used when the mouse cursor is over the radiobutton. The
empty string is the default value.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-selectimage Database Name:
selectImage Database Class: SelectImage</p>

<p>Specifies an image to display (in place of the image
option) when the radiobutton is selected. This option is
ignored unless the image option has been specified.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-state Database Name: state Database
Class: State</p>

<p>Specifies one of three states for the radiobutton:
normal, active, or disabled. In normal state the radiobutton
is dis- played using the foreground and background options.
The active state is typically used when the pointer is over
the radiobut- ton. In active state the radiobutton is
displayed using the activeForeground and activeBackground
options. Disabled state means that the radiobutton should be
insensitive: the default bindings will refuse to activate
the widget and will ignore mouse button presses. In this
state the disabledForeground and background options
determine how the radiobutton is displayed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-tristateimage Database Name:
tristateImage Database Class: TristateImage</p>

<p>Specifies an image to display (in place of the image
option) when the radiobutton is selected. This option is
ignored unless the image option has been specified.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-tristatevalue Database Name:
tristateValue Database Class: Value</p>

<p>Specifies the value that causes the radiobutton to
display the multi-value selection, also known as the
tri-state mode. Defaults to .</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-value Database Name: value Database
Class: Value</p>

<p>Specifies value to store in the button s associated
variable whenever this button is selected.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-variable Database Name: variable
Database Class: Variable</p>

<p>Specifies name of global variable to set whenever this
button is selected. Changes in this variable also cause the
button to select or deselect itself. Defaults to the value
selectedBut- ton.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image or
bitmap is being displayed in the button, the value is in
screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in characters. If this option
is not specified, the buttons desired width is computed from
the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in
it.

<p>DESCRIPTION The radiobutton command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a
radiobutton widget. Additional options, described above, may
be specified on the command line or in the option database
to configure aspects of the radiobutton such as its colors,
font, text, and initial relief. The radiobutton command
returns its pathName argument. At the time this command is
invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName, but
pathNames parent must exist.</p>

<p>A radiobutton is a widget that displays a textual
string, bitmap or image and a diamond or circle called an
indicator. If text is dis- played, it must all be in a
single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the screen
(if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of
the wrapLength option) and one of the characters may option-
ally be underlined using the underline option. A radiobutton
has all of the behavior of a simple button: it can display
itself in either of three different ways, according to the
state option; it can be made to appear raised, sunken, or
flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes a Tcl command
whenever mouse button 1 is clicked over the check
button.</p>

<p>In addition, radiobuttons can be selected. If a
radiobutton is selected, the indicator is normally drawn
with a selected appearance, and a Tcl variable associated
with the radiobutton is set to a particu- lar value
(normally 1). Under Unix, the indicator is drawn with a
sunken relief and a special color. Under Windows, the
indicator is drawn with a round mark inside. If the
radiobutton is not selected, then the indicator is drawn
with a deselected appearance, and the asso- ciated variable
is set to a different value (typically 0). The indica- tor
is drawn without a round mark inside. Typically, several
radiobut- tons share a single variable and the value of the
variable indicates which radiobutton is to be selected. When
a radiobutton is selected it sets the value of the variable
to indicate that fact; each radiobutton also monitors the
value of the variable and automatically selects and
deselects itself when the variables value changes. If the
variables value matches the tristateValue, then the
radiobutton is drawn using the tri-state mode. This mode is
used to indicate mixed or multiple values. (This is used
when the radiobutton represents the state of multiple
items.) By default the variable selectedButton is used; its
contents give the name of the button that is selected, or
the empty string if no button associated with that variable
is selected. The name of the variable for a radiobutton,
plus the variable to be stored into it, may be modified with
options on the command line or in the option database.
Configuration options may also be used to modify the way the
indicator is displayed (or whether it is displayed at all).
By default a radiobutton is configured to select itself on
button clicks.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The radiobutton command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is path- Name. This command may be used
to invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
The following commands are possible for radiobutton
widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the radiobutton command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, the command modifies the given widget option(s)
to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns
an empty string. Option may have any of the values accepted
by the radiobutton command.</p>

<p>pathName deselect Deselects the radiobutton and sets the
associated variable to an empty string. If this radiobutton
was not currently selected, the command has no effect.</p>

<p>pathName flash Flashes the radiobutton. This is
accomplished by redisplaying the radiobutton several times,
alternating between active and normal colors. At the end of
the flash the radiobutton is left in the same normal/active
state as when the command was invoked. This command is
ignored if the radiobuttons state is disabled.</p>

<p>pathName invoke Does just what would have happened if
the user invoked the radiobutton with the mouse: selects the
button and invokes its associated Tcl command, if there is
one. The return value is the return value from the Tcl
command, or an empty string if there is no command
associated with the radiobutton. This com- mand is ignored
if the radiobutton s state is disabled.</p>

<p>pathName select Selects the radiobutton and sets the
associated variable to the value corresponding to this
widget.</p>

<p>BINDINGS Tk automatically creates class bindings for
radiobuttons that give them the following default
behavior:</p>

<p>[1] On Unix systems, a radiobutton activates whenever
the mouse passes over it and deactivates whenever the mouse
leaves the radiobutton. On Mac and Windows systems, when
mouse button 1 is pressed over a radiobutton, the button
activates whenever the mouse pointer is inside the button,
and deactivates whenever the mouse pointer leaves the
button.</p>

<p>[2] When mouse button 1 is pressed over a radiobutton it
is invoked (it becomes selected and the command associated
with the button is invoked, if there is one).</p>

<p>[3] When a radiobutton has the input focus, the space
key causes the radiobutton to be invoked.</p>

<p>If the radiobuttons state is disabled then none of the
above actions occur: the radiobutton is completely
non-responsive.</p>

<p>The behavior of radiobuttons can be changed by defining
new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the
class bindings.</p>
