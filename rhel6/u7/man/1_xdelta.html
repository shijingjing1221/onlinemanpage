<p>Xdelta(1) Xdelta(1)</p>

<p>NAME xdelta - Invoke Xdelta</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xdelta subcommand [ option... ] [ operand...
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xdelta provides the ability to generate
deltas between a pair of files and later apply those deltas.
It operates similar to the diff and patch commands, but
works on binary files and does not produce a human readable
output.</p>

<p>Xdelta has three subcommands, delta, patch, and info.
Delta accepts two file versions and produces a delta, while
patch accepts the origi- nal file version and delta and
produces the second version. The info command prints useful
information about a delta. Each subcommand will be detailed
seperately.</p>

<p>Gzip processing Attempting to compute a delta between
compressed input files usually results in poor compression.
This is because small differences between the original
contents causes changes in the compression of whole blocks
of data. To simplify things, Xdelta implements a special
case for gzip(1) compressed files. If any version input to
the delta command is recognized as having gzip compression,
it will be automatically decom- pressed into a temporary
location prior to comparison. This temporary location is
either the value of the TMPDIR environment variable, if set,
otherwise &quot;/tmp&quot;.</p>

<p>The Xdelta patch header contains a flag indicating that
the recon- structed version should be recompressed after
applying the patch. In general, this allows Xdelta to
operate transparently on gzip compressed inputs.</p>

<p>There is one potential problem when automatically
processing gzip com- pressed files, which is that the
recompressed content does not always match byte-for-byte
with the original compressed content. The uncom- pressed
content still matches, but if there is an external integrity
check such as cryptographic signature verification, it may
fail. To prevent this from happening, the --pristine option
disables automatic gzip processing.</p>

<p>MD5 integrity check By default, Xdelta always verifies
the MD5 checksum of the files it reconstructs. This prevents
you from supplying an incorrect input dur- ing patch, which
would result in corrupt output. Because of this fea- ture,
you can feel confident that patch has produced valid
results. The --noverify option disables MD5 verification,
but this is only rec- ommended for performance testing.</p>

<p>Compressed patch format Xdelta uses a fairly simple
encoding for its delta, then applies zlib compression to the
result. You should not have to post-compress an Xdelta
delta.</p>

<p>Delta The delta subcommand has the following
synopsis:</p>

<p>xdelta delta [ option... ] fromfile tofile patchout</p>

<p>Computes a delta from fromfile to tofile and writes it
to patchout</p>

<p>Patch The patch subcommand has the following
synopsis:</p>

<p>xdelta patch [ option... ] patchin [ fromfile [ tofile
]]</p>

<p>Applies patchin to fromfile and produces a reconstructed
version of tofile.</p>

<p>If fromfile was omitted, Xdelta attempts to use the
original fromfile name, which is stored in the delta. The
from file must be identical to the one used to create the
delta. If its length or MD5 checksum dif- fers, patch will
abort with an error message.</p>

<p>If tofile was omitted, Xdelta attempts to use the
original tofile name, which is also stored in the delta. If
the original tofile name already exists, a unique filename
extension will be added to avoid destroying any existing
data.</p>

<p>Info The info subcommand has the following synopsis:</p>

<p>xdelta info patchinfo</p>

<p>Prints information about patchinfo and the version it
reconstructs, including file names, lengths, and MD5
checksums.</p>

<p>Options -0..9 Set the zlib compression level. Zero
indicates no compression. Nine indicates maximum
compression.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a short help message and exit.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Quiet. Surpresses several warning
messages.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the Xdelta version number and
exit.</p>

<p>-V, --verbose Verbose. Prints a bit of extra
information.</p>

<p>-n, --noverify No verify. Turns off MD5 checksum
verification of the input and output files.</p>

<p>-m=SIZE, --maxmem=SIZE Set an upper bound on the size of
an in-memory page cache. For example, --maxmem=32M will use
a 32 megabyte page cache.</p>

<p>-s=BLOCK_SIZE Set the block size, unless it was hard
coded (20% speed improve- ment). Should be a power of 2.</p>

<p>-p, --pristine Disable the automatic decompression of
gzipped inputs, to pre- vent unexpected differences in the
re-compressed content.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The delta command exits with status 0 to
indicate that no differences were found, with status 1 to
indicate that some differences were found, and with status 2
to indicate an error of some kind. The patch and info
commands exit with status 0 on success and 2 on failure.</p>
