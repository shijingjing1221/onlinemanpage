<p>UMASK(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual UMASK(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME umask - get or set the file mode creation mask</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS umask [-S][mask]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The umask utility shall set the file mode
creation mask of the current shell execution environment
(see Shell Execution Environment ) to the value specified by
the mask operand. This mask shall affect the initial value
of the file permission bits of subsequently created files.
If umask is called in a subshell or separate utility
execution environ- ment, such as one of the following:</p>

<p>(umask 002) nohup umask ... find . -exec umask ...;</p>

<p>it shall not affect the file mode creation mask of the
callers envi- ronment.</p>

<p>If the mask operand is not specified, the umask utility
shall write to standard output the value of the invoking
process file mode creation mask.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The umask utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported:</p>

<p>-S Produce symbolic output.</p>

<p>The default output style is unspecified, but shall be
recognized on a subsequent invocation of umask on the same
system as a mask operand to restore the previous file mode
creation mask.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>mask A string specifying the new file mode creation
mask. The string is treated in the same way as the mode
operand described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section for
chmod.</p>

<p>For a symbolic_mode value, the new value of the file
mode creation mask shall be the logical complement of the
file permission bits portion of the file mode specified by
the symbolic_mode string.</p>

<p>In a symbolic_mode value, the permissions op
characters+and- shall be interpreted relative to the current
file mode creation mask; + shall cause the bits for the
indicated permissions to be cleared in the mask; - shall
cause the bits for the indicated permissions to be set in
the mask.</p>

<p>The interpretation of mode values that specify file mode
bits other than the file permission bits is unspecified.</p>

<p>In the octal integer form of mode, the specified bits
are set in the file mode creation mask.</p>

<p>The file mode creation mask shall be set to the
resulting numeric value.</p>

<p>The default output of a prior invocation of umask on the
same system with no operand also shall be recognized as a
mask operand.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of umask:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When the mask operand is not specified, the umask
utility shall write a message to standard output that can
later be used as a umask mask operand.</p>

<p>If -S is specified, the message shall be in the
following format:</p>

<p>&quot;u=%s,g=%s,o=%n&quot;, &lt;owner permissions&gt;,
&lt;group permissions&gt;, &lt;other permissions&gt;</p>

<p>where the three values shall be combinations of letters
from the set { r, w, x}; the presence of a letter shall
indicate that the correspond- ing bit is clear in the file
mode creation mask.</p>

<p>If a mask operand is specified, there shall be no output
written to standard output.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 The file mode creation mask was successfully changed,
or no mask operand was supplied.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since umask affects the current shell
execution environment, it is gen- erally provided as a shell
regular built-in.</p>

<p>In contrast to the negative permission logic provided by
the file mode creation mask and the octal number form of the
mask argument, the sym- bolic form of the mask argument
specifies those permissions that are left alone.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Either of the commands:</p>

<p>umask a=rx,ug+w</p>

<p>umask 002</p>

<p>sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files
have their S_IWOTH bit cleared.</p>

<p>After setting the mode mask with either of the above
commands, the umask command can be used to write out the
current value of the mode mask:</p>

<p>$ umask 0002</p>

<p>(The output format is unspecified, but historical
implementations use the octal integer mode format.)</p>

<p>$ umask -S u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx</p>

<p>Either of these outputs can be used as the mask operand
to a subsequent invocation of the umask utility.</p>

<p>Assuming the mode mask is set as above, the command:</p>

<p>umask g-w</p>

<p>sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files
have their S_IWGRP and S_IWOTH bits cleared.</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>umask -- -w</p>

<p>sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files
have all their write bits cleared. Note that mask operands
-r, -w, -x or anything beginning with a hyphen, must be
preceded by &quot;--&quot; to keep it from being interpreted
as an option.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Since umask affects the current shell
execution environment, it is gen- erally provided as a shell
regular built-in. If it is called in a sub- shell or
separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
following:</p>

<p>(umask 002) nohup umask ... find . -exec umask ...;</p>

<p>it does not affect the file mode creation mask of the
environment of the caller.</p>

<p>The description of the historical utility was modified
to allow it to use the symbolic modes of chmod. The -s
option used in early proposals was changed to -S because -s
could be confused with a symbolic_mode form of mask
referring to the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits.</p>

<p>The default output style is implementation-defined to
permit implemen- tors to provide migration to the new
symbolic style at the time most appropriate to their users.
A -o flag to force octal mode output was omitted because the
octal mode may not be sufficient to specify all of the
information that may be present in the file mode creation
mask when more secure file access permission checks are
implemented.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that trusted systems developers
might appreciate ameliorating the requirement that the mode
mask &quot;affects&quot; the file access permissions, since
it seems access control lists might replace the mode mask to
some degree. The wording has been changed to say that it
affects the file permission bits, and it leaves the details
of the behavior of how they affect the file access
permissions to the descrip- tion in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
