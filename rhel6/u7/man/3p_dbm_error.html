DBM_CLEARERR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be

<p>NAME dbm_clearerr, dbm_close, dbm_delete, dbm_error,
dbm_fetch, dbm_firstkey, dbm_nextkey, dbm_open, dbm_store -
database functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ndbm.h&gt;</p>

<p>int dbm_clearerr(DBM *db); void dbm_close(DBM *db); int
dbm_delete(DBM *db, datum key); int dbm_error(DBM *db);
datum dbm_fetch(DBM *db, datum key); datum dbm_firstkey(DBM
*db); datum dbm_nextkey(DBM *db); DBM *dbm_open(const char
*file, int open_flags, mode_t file_mode); int dbm_store(DBM
*db, datum key, datum content, int store_mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions create, access, and modify a
database.</p>

<p>A datum consists of at least two members, dptr and
dsize. The dptr member points to an object that is dsize
bytes in length. Arbitrary binary data, as well as character
strings, may be stored in the object pointed to by dptr.</p>

<p>The database is stored in two files. One file is a
directory containing a bitmap of keys and has .dir as its
suffix. The second file contains all data and has .pag as
its suffix.</p>

<p>The dbm_open() function shall open a database. The file
argument to the function is the pathname of the database.
The function opens two files named file.dir and file.pag.
The open_flags argument has the same meaning as the flags
argument of open() except that a database opened for
write-only access opens the files for read and write access
and the behavior of the O_APPEND flag is unspecified. The
file_mode argument has the same meaning as the third
argument of open().</p>

<p>The dbm_close() function shall close a database. The
application shall ensure that argument db is a pointer to a
dbm structure that has been returned from a call to
dbm_open().</p>

<p>These database functions shall support an internal block
size large enough to support key/content pairs of at least
1023 bytes.</p>

<p>The dbm_fetch() function shall read a record from a
database. The argument db is a pointer to a database
structure that has been returned from a call to dbm_open().
The argument key is a datum that has been initialized by the
application to the value of the key that matches the key of
the record the program is fetching.</p>

<p>The dbm_store() function shall write a record to a
database. The argu- ment db is a pointer to a database
structure that has been returned from a call to dbm_open().
The argument key is a datum that has been initialized by the
application to the value of the key that identifies (for
subsequent reading, writing, or deleting) the record the
application is writing. The argument content is a datum that
has been initialized by the application to the value of the
record the program is writing. The argument store_mode
controls whether dbm_store() replaces any pre-existing
record that has the same key that is speci- fied by the key
argument. The application shall set store_mode to either
DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE. If the database contains a record
that matches the key argument and store_mode is DBM_REPLACE,
the exist- ing record shall be replaced with the new record.
If the database con- tains a record that matches the key
argument and store_mode is DBM_INSERT, the existing record
shall be left unchanged and the new record ignored. If the
database does not contain a record that matches the key
argument and store_mode is either DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE,
the new record shall be inserted in the database.</p>

<p>If the sum of a key/content pair exceeds the internal
block size, the result is unspecified. Moreover, the
application shall ensure that all key/content pairs that
hash together fit on a single block. The dbm_store()
function shall return an error in the event that a disk
block fills with inseparable data.</p>

<p>The dbm_delete() function shall delete a record and its
key from the database. The argument db is a pointer to a
database structure that has been returned from a call to
dbm_open(). The argument key is a datum that has been
initialized by the application to the value of the key that
identifies the record the program is deleting.</p>

<p>The dbm_firstkey() function shall return the first key
in the database. The argument db is a pointer to a database
structure that has been returned from a call to
dbm_open().</p>

<p>The dbm_nextkey() function shall return the next key in
the database. The argument db is a pointer to a database
structure that has been returned from a call to dbm_open().
The application shall ensure that the dbm_firstkey()
function is called before calling dbm_nextkey(). Subsequent
calls to dbm_nextkey() return the next key until all of the
keys in the database have been returned.</p>

<p>The dbm_error() function shall return the error
condition of the database. The argument db is a pointer to a
database structure that has been returned from a call to
dbm_open().</p>

<p>The dbm_clearerr() function shall clear the error
condition of the database. The argument db is a pointer to a
database structure that has been returned from a call to
dbm_open().</p>

<p>The dptr pointers returned by these functions may point
into static storage that may be changed by subsequent
calls.</p>

<p>These functions need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The dbm_store() and dbm_delete() functions
shall return 0 when they succeed and a negative value when
they fail.</p>

<p>The dbm_store() function shall return 1 if it is called
with a flags value of DBM_INSERT and the function finds an
existing record with the same key.</p>

<p>The dbm_error() function shall return 0 if the error
condition is not set and return a non-zero value if the
error condition is set.</p>

<p>The return value of dbm_clearerr() is unspecified.</p>

<p>The dbm_firstkey() and dbm_nextkey() functions shall
return a key datum. When the end of the database is reached,
the dptr member of the key is a null pointer. If an error is
detected, the dptr member of the key shall be a null pointer
and the error condition of the database shall be set.</p>

<p>The dbm_fetch() function shall return a content datum.
If no record in the database matches the key or if an error
condition has been detected in the database, the dptr member
of the content shall be a null pointer.</p>

<p>The dbm_open() function shall return a pointer to a
database structure. If an error is detected during the
operation, dbm_open() shall return a ( DBM *)0.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The following code can be used to
traverse the database:</p>

<p>for(key = dbm_firstkey(db); key.dptr != NULL; key =
dbm_nextkey(db))</p>

<p>The dbm_* functions provided in this library should not
be confused in any way with those of a general-purpose
database management system. These functions do not provide
for multiple search keys per entry, they do not protect
against multi-user access (in other words they do not lock
records or files), and they do not provide the many other
useful database functions that are found in more robust
database management systems. Creating and updating databases
by use of these functions is relatively slow because of data
copies that occur upon hash collisions. These functions are
useful for applications requiring fast lookup of relatively
static information that is to be indexed by a single
key.</p>

<p>Note that a strictly conforming application is extremely
limited by these functions: since there is no way to
determine that the keys in use do not all hash to the same
value (although that would be rare), a strictly conforming
application cannot be guaranteed that it can store more than
one blocks worth of data in the database. As long as a key
collision does not occur, additional data may be stored, but
because there is no way to determine whether an error is due
to a key collision or some other error condition (
dbm_error() being effectively a Boolean), once an error is
detected, the application is effectively limited to guessing
what the error might be if it wishes to continue using these
functions.</p>

<p>The dbm_delete() function need not physically reclaim
file space, although it does make it available for reuse by
the database.</p>

<p>After calling dbm_store() or dbm_delete() during a pass
through the keys by dbm_firstkey() and dbm_nextkey(), the
application should reset the database by calling
dbm_firstkey() before again calling dbm_nex- tkey(). The
contents of these files are unspecified and may not be
portable.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
