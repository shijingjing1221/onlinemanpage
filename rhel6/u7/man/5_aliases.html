<p>ALIASES(5) ALIASES(5)</p>

<p>NAME aliases - Postfix local alias database format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS newaliases</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aliases(5) table provides a system-wide
mechanism to redirect mail for local recipients. The
redirections are processed by the Postfix local(8) delivery
agent.</p>

<p>Normally, the aliases(5) table is specified as a text
file that serves as input to the postalias(1) command. The
result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
fast lookup by the mail system. Execute the command
newaliases in order to rebuild the indexed file after
changing the Postfix alias database.</p>

<p>The input and output file formats are expected to be
compatible with Sendmail version 8, and are expected to be
suitable for the use as NIS maps.</p>

<p>Users can control delivery of their own mail by setting
up .forward files in their home directory. Lines in per-user
.forward files have the same syntax as the right-hand side
of aliases(5) entries.</p>

<p>The format of the alias database input file is as
follows:</p>

<p>&middot; An alias definition has the form</p>

<p>name: value1, value2, ...</p>

<p>&middot; Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are
ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace character
is a #.</p>

<p>&middot; A logical line starts with non-whitespace text.
A line that starts with whitespace continues a logical
line.</p>

<p>The name is a local address (no domain part). Use double
quotes when the name contains any special characters such as
whitespace, #, :, or @. The name is folded to lowercase, in
order to make database lookups case insensitive.</p>

<p>In addition, when an alias exists for owner-name,
delivery diagnostics are directed to that address, instead
of to the originator of the mes- sage. This is typically
used to direct delivery errors to the main- tainer of a
mailing list, who is in a better position to deal with
mailing list delivery problems than the originator of the
undelivered mail.</p>

<p>The value contains one or more of the following:</p>

<p>address Mail is forwarded to address, which is
compatible with the RFC 822 standard.</p>

<p>/file/name Mail is appended to /file/name. See local(8)
for details of delivery to file. Delivery is not limited to
regular files. For example, to dispose of unwanted mail,
deflect it to /dev/null.</p>

<p>|command Mail is piped into command. Commands that
contain special char- acters, such as whitespace, should be
enclosed between double quotes. See local(8) for details of
delivery to command.</p>

<p>When the command fails, a limited amount of command
output is mailed back to the sender. The file
/usr/include/sysexits.h defines the expected exit status
codes. For example, use &quot;|exit 67&quot; to simulate a
&quot;user unknown&quot; error, and &quot;|exit 0&quot; to
imple- ment an expensive black hole.</p>

<p>:include:/file/name Mail is sent to the destinations
listed in the named file. Lines in :include: files have the
same syntax as the right-hand side of alias entries.</p>

<p>A destination can be any destination that is described
in this manual page. However, delivery to
&quot;|command&quot; and /file/name is disallowed by
default. To enable, edit the allow_mail_to_com- mands and
allow_mail_to_files configuration parameters.</p>

<p>ADDRESS EXTENSION When alias database search fails, and
the recipient localpart contains the optional recipient
delimiter (e.g., user+foo), the search is repeated for the
unextended address (e.g., user).</p>

<p>The propagate_unmatched_extensions parameter controls
whether an unmatched address extension (+foo) is propagated
to the result of table lookup.</p>

<p>CASE FOLDING The local(8) delivery agent always folds
the search string to lowercase before database lookup.</p>

<p>SECURITY The local(8) delivery agent disallows regular
expression substitution of $1 etc. in alias_maps, because
that would open a security hole.</p>

<p>The local(8) delivery agent will silently ignore
requests to use the proxymap(8) server within alias_maps.
Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix
version 2.2, the local(8) delivery agent will terminate with
a fatal error.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS The following main.cf
parameters are especially relevant. The text below provides
only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for more details
including examples.</p>

<p>alias_database List of alias databases that are updated
by the newaliases(1) command.</p>

<p>alias_maps List of alias databases queried by the
local(8) delivery agent.</p>

<p>allow_mail_to_commands Restrict the usage of mail
delivery to external command.</p>

<p>allow_mail_to_files Restrict the usage of mail delivery
to external file.</p>

<p>expand_owner_alias When delivering to an alias that has
an owner- companion alias, set the envelope sender address
to the right-hand side of the owner alias, instead using of
the left-hand side address.</p>

<p>propagate_unmatched_extensions A list of address
rewriting or forwarding mechanisms that propa- gate an
address extension from the original address to the result.
Specify zero or more of canonical, virtual, alias, for-
ward, include, or generic.</p>

<p>owner_request_special Give special treatment to
owner-listname and listname-request addresses.</p>

<p>recipient_delimiter Delimiter that separates recipients
from address extensions.</p>

<p>Available in Postfix version 2.3 and later:</p>

<p>frozen_delivered_to Update the local(8) delivery agents
Delivered-To: address (see prepend_delivered_header) only
once, at the start of a delivery; do not update the
Delivered-To: address while expanding aliases or .forward
files.</p>
