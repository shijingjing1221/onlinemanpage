<p>PERL586DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL586DELTA(1)</p>

<p>NAME perl586delta - what is new for perl v5.8.6</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes differences between
the 5.8.5 release and the 5.8.6 release.</p>

<p>Incompatible Changes There are no changes incompatible
with 5.8.5.</p>

<p>Core Enhancements The perl interpreter is now more
tolerant of UTF-16-encoded scripts.</p>

<p>On Win32, Perl can now use non-IFS compatible LSPs,
which allows Perl to work in conjunction with firewalls such
as McAfee Guardian. For full details see the file
README.win32, particularly if you re running Win95.</p>

<p>Modules and Pragmata &middot; With the &quot;base&quot;
pragma, an intermediate class with no fields used to messes
up private fields in the base class. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p>&middot; Cwd upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of the
new PathTools distribution)</p>

<p>&middot; Devel::PPPort upgraded to version 3.03</p>

<p>&middot; File::Spec upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of
the new PathTools distribution)</p>

<p>&middot; Encode upgraded to version 2.08</p>

<p>&middot; ExtUtils::MakeMaker remains at version 6.17, as
later stable releases currently available on CPAN have some
issues with core modules on some core platforms.</p>

<p>&middot; I18N::LangTags upgraded to version 0.35</p>

<p>&middot; Math::BigInt upgraded to version 1.73</p>

<p>&middot; Math::BigRat upgraded to version 0.13</p>

<p>&middot; MIME::Base64 upgraded to version 3.05</p>

<p>&middot; POSIX::sigprocmask function can now retrieve
the current signal mask without also setting it.</p>

<p>&middot; Time::HiRes upgraded to version 1.65</p>

<p>Utility Changes Perl has a new -dt command-line flag,
which enables threads support in the debugger.</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements &quot;reverse sort ...&quot; is
now optimized to sort in reverse, avoiding the generation of
a temporary intermediate list.</p>

<p>&quot;for (reverse @foo)&quot; now iterates in reverse,
avoiding the generation of a temporary reversed list.</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes The regexp engine is now more robust
when given invalid utf8 input, as is sometimes generated by
buggy XS modules.</p>

<p>&quot;foreach&quot; on threads::shared array used to be
able to crash Perl. This bug has now been fixed.</p>

<p>A regexp in &quot;STDOUT&quot;s destructor used to
coredump, because the regexp pad was already freed. This has
been fixed.</p>

<p>&quot;goto &amp;&quot; is now more robust - bugs in deep
recursion and chained &quot;goto &amp;&quot; have been
fixed.</p>

<p>Using &quot;delete&quot; on an array no longer leaks
memory. A &quot;pop&quot; of an item from a shared array
reference no longer causes a leak.</p>

<p>&quot;eval_sv()&quot; failing a taint test could corrupt
the stack - this has been fixed.</p>

<p>On platforms with 64 bit pointers numeric comparison
operators used to erroneously compare the addresses of
references that are overloaded, rather than using the
overloaded values. This has been fixed.</p>

<p>&quot;read&quot; into a UTF8-encoded buffer with an
offset off the end of the buffer no longer mis-calculates
buffer lengths.</p>

<p>Although Perl has promised since version 5.8 that
&quot;sort()&quot; would be stable, the two cases &quot;sort
{$b cmp $a}&quot; and &quot;sort {$b &lt;=&gt; $a}&quot;
could produce non-stable sorts. This is corrected in
perl5.8.6.</p>

<p>Localising $^D no longer generates a diagnostic message
about valid -D flags.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics For -t and -T, Too late for
&quot;-T&quot; option has been changed to the more
informative &quot;-T&quot; is on the #! line, it must also
be used on the command line</p>

<p>Changed Internals From now on all applications embedding
perl will behave as if perl were compiled with
-DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV. See &quot;Environment access&quot;
in the INSTALL file for details.</p>

<p>Most &quot;C&quot; source files now have comments at the
top explaining their purpose, which should help anyone
wishing to get an overview of the implementation.</p>

<p>New Tests There are significantly more tests for the
&quot;B&quot; suite of modules.</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs
at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
