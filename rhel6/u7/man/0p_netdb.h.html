<p>NAME netdb.h - definitions for network database
operations</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header may define the
in_port_t type and the in_addr_t type as described in
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt; .</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the hostent
structure that includes at least the following members:</p>

<p>char *h_name Official name of the host. char **h_aliases
A pointer to an array of pointers to alternative host names,
terminated by a null pointer. int h_addrtype Address type.
int h_length The length, in bytes, of the address. char
**h_addr_list A pointer to an array of pointers to network
addresses (in network byte order) for the host, terminated
by a null pointer.</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the netent
structure that includes at least the following members:</p>

<p>char *n_name Official, fully-qualified (including the
domain) name of the host. char **n_aliases A pointer to an
array of pointers to alternative network names, terminated
by a null pointer. int n_addrtype The address type of the
network. uint32_t n_net The network number, in host byte
order.</p>

<p>The uint32_t type shall be defined as described in
&lt;inttypes.h&gt; .</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the protoent
structure that includes at least the following members:</p>

<p>char *p_name Official name of the protocol. char
**p_aliases A pointer to an array of pointers to alternative
protocol names, terminated by a null pointer. int p_proto
The protocol number.</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the servent
structure that includes at least the following members:</p>

<p>char *s_name Official name of the service. char
**s_aliases A pointer to an array of pointers to alternative
service names, terminated by a null pointer. int s_port The
port number at which the service resides, in network byte
order. char *s_proto The name of the protocol to use when
contacting the service.</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the
IPPORT_RESERVED macro with the value of the highest reserved
Internet port number.</p>

<p>When the &lt;netdb.h&gt; header is included, h_errno
shall be available as a modifiable lvalue of type int. It is
unspecified whether h_errno is a macro or an identifier
declared with external linkage.</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the following
macros for use as error values for gethostbyaddr() and
gethostbyname():</p>

<p>HOST_NOT_FOUND NO_DATA NO_RECOVERY TRY_AGAIN</p>

<p>Address Information Structure The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header
shall define the addrinfo structure that includes at least
the following members:</p>

<p>int ai_flags Input flags. int ai_family Address family
of socket. int ai_socktype Socket type. int ai_protocol
Protocol of socket. socklen_t ai_addrlen Length of socket
address. struct sockaddr *ai_addr Socket address of socket.
char *ai_canonname Canonical name of service location.
struct addrinfo *ai_next Pointer to next in list.</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the following
macros that evaluate to bitwise-distinct integer constants
for use in the flags field of the addrinfo structure:</p>

<p>AI_PASSIVE Socket address is intended for bind().</p>

<p>AI_CANONNAME</p>

<p>Request for canonical name.</p>

<p>AI_NUMERICHOST</p>

<p>Return numeric host address as name.</p>

<p>AI_NUMERICSERV</p>

<p>Inhibit service name resolution.</p>

<p>AI_V4MAPPED If no IPv6 addresses are found, query for
IPv4 addresses and return them to the caller as IPv4-mapped
IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p>AI_ALL Query for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p>AI_ADDRCONFIG</p>

<p>Query for IPv4 addresses only when an IPv4 address is
config- ured; query for IPv6 addresses only when an IPv6
address is con- figured.</p>

<p>The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header shall define the following
macros that evaluate to bitwise-distinct integer constants
for use in the flags argument to getnameinfo():</p>

<p>NI_NOFQDN Only the nodename portion of the FQDN is
returned for local hosts.</p>

<p>NI_NUMERICHOST</p>

<p>The numeric form of the node s address is returned
instead of its name.</p>

<p>NI_NAMEREQD Return an error if the node s name cannot be
located in the database.</p>

<p>NI_NUMERICSERV</p>

<p>The numeric form of the service address is returned
instead of its name.</p>

<p>NI_NUMERICSCOPE</p>

<p>For IPv6 addresses, the numeric form of the scope
identifier is returned instead of its name.</p>

<p>NI_DGRAM Indicates that the service is a datagram
service (SOCK_DGRAM).</p>

<p>Address Information Errors The &lt;netdb.h&gt; header
shall define the following macros for use as error values
for getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo():</p>

<p>EAI_AGAIN The name could not be resolved at this time.
Future attempts may succeed.</p>

<p>EAI_BADFLAGS The flags had an invalid value.</p>

<p>EAI_FAIL A non-recoverable error occurred.</p>

<p>EAI_FAMILY The address family was not recognized or the
address length was invalid for the specified family.</p>

<p>EAI_MEMORY There was a memory allocation failure.</p>

<p>EAI_NONAME The name does not resolve for the supplied
parameters.</p>

<p>NI_NAMEREQD is set and the hosts name cannot be located,
or both node- name and servname were null.</p>

<p>EAI_SERVICE The service passed was not recognized for
the specified socket type.</p>

<p>EAI_SOCKTYPE The intended socket type was not
recognized.</p>

<p>EAI_SYSTEM A system error occurred. The error code can
be found in errno.</p>

<p>EAI_OVERFLOW</p>

<p>An argument buffer overflowed.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>void endhostent(void); void endnetent(void); void
endprotoent(void); void endservent(void); void
freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *); const char
*gai_strerror(int); int getaddrinfo(const char *restrict,
const char *restrict, const struct addrinfo *restrict,
struct addrinfo **restrict); struct hostent
*gethostbyaddr(const void *, socklen_t, int); struct hostent
*gethostbyname(const char *); struct hostent
*gethostent(void); int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr
*restrict, socklen_t, char *restrict, socklen_t, char
*restrict, socklen_t, int); struct netent
*getnetbyaddr(uint32_t, int); struct netent
*getnetbyname(const char *); struct netent *getnetent(void);
struct protoent *getprotobyname(const char *); struct
protoent *getprotobynumber(int); struct protoent
*getprotoent(void); struct servent *getservbyname(const char
*, const char *); struct servent *getservbyport(int, const
char *); struct servent *getservent(void); void
sethostent(int); void setnetent(int); void setprotoent(int);
void setservent(int);</p>

<p>The type socklen_t shall be defined through typedef as
described in &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Inclusion of the &lt;netdb.h&gt; header may also make
visible all symbols from &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;,
&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;, and &lt;inttypes.h&gt;.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
