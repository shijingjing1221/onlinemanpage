<p>NAME smtp-source - multi-threaded SMTP/LMTP test
generator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smtp-source [options] [inet:]host[:port]</p>

<p>smtp-source [options] unix:pathname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION smtp-source connects to the named host and
TCP port (default: port 25) and sends one or more messages
to it, either sequentially or in paral- lel. The program
speaks either SMTP (default) or LMTP. Connections can be
made to UNIX-domain and IPv4 or IPv6 servers. IPv4 and IPv6
are the default.</p>

<p>Note: this is an unsupported test program. No attempt is
made to main- tain compatibility between successive
versions.</p>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<p>-4 Connect to the server with IPv4. This option has no
effect when Postfix is built without IPv6 support.</p>

<p>-6 Connect to the server with IPv6. This option is not
available when Postfix is built without IPv6 support.</p>

<p>-A Don t abort when the server sends something other
than the expected positive reply code.</p>

<p>-c Display a running counter that is incremented each
time an SMTP DATA command completes.</p>

<p>-C count When a host sends RESET instead of SYN|ACK, try
count times before giving up. The default count is 1.
Specify a larger count in order to work around a problem
with TCP/IP stacks that send RESET when the listen queue is
full.</p>

<p>-d Dont disconnect after sending a message; send the
next message over the same connection.</p>

<p>-f from Use the specified sender address (default:
&lt;foo@myhostname&gt;).</p>

<p>-F file Send the pre-formatted message header and body
in the specified file, while prepending . before lines that
begin with ., and while appending CRLF after each line.</p>

<p>-l length Send length bytes as message payload. The
length does not include message headers.</p>

<p>-L Speak LMTP rather than SMTP.</p>

<p>-m message_count Send the specified number of messages
(default: 1).</p>

<p>-M myhostname Use the specified hostname or [address] in
the HELO command and in the default sender and recipient
addresses, instead of the machine hostname.</p>

<p>-N Prepend a non-repeating sequence number to each
recipient address. This avoids the artificial 100% hit rate
in the resolve and rewrite client caches and exercises the
trivial-rewrite dae- mon, better approximating Postfix
performance under real-life work-loads.</p>

<p>-o Old mode: dont send HELO, and don t send message
headers.</p>

<p>-r recipient_count Send the specified number of
recipients per transaction (default: 1). Recipient names are
generated by prepending a number to the recipient
address.</p>

<p>-R interval Wait for a random period of time 0 &lt;= n
&lt;= interval between mes- sages. Suspending one thread
does not affect other delivery threads.</p>

<p>-s session_count Run the specified number of SMTP
sessions in parallel (default: 1).</p>

<p>-S subject Send mail with the named subject line
(default: none).</p>

<p>-t to Use the specified recipient address (default:
&lt;foo@myhostname&gt;).</p>

<p>-T windowsize Override the default TCP window size. To
work around broken TCP window scaling implementations,
specify a value &gt; 0 and &lt; 65536.</p>

<p>-v Make the program more verbose, for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p>-w interval Wait a fixed time between messages.
Suspending one thread does not affect other delivery
threads.</p>

<p>[inet:]host[:port] Connect via TCP to host host, port
port. The default port is smtp.</p>

<p>unix:pathname Connect to the UNIX-domain socket at
pathname.</p>

<p>BUGS No SMTP command pipelining support.</p>
