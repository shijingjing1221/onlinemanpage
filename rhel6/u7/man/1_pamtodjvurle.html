<p>HISTORY pamtodjvurle was new in Netpbm 10.22 (April
2004) but a program that did almost the same thing, called
ppmtodjvurle, was in Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004). The latter
was written and contributed to Netpbm by Scott Pakin
&lt;scott+pbm@pakin.org&gt;. pamtodjvurle uses techniques
taken from ppmtodjvurle, but no code is copied between
them.</p>
