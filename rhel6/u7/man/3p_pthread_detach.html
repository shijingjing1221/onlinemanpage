<p>PTHREAD_DETACH(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_DETACH(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_detach - detach a thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_detach() function shall indicate
to the implementation that storage for the thread thread can
be reclaimed when that thread termi- nates. If thread has
not terminated, pthread_detach() shall not cause it to
terminate. The effect of multiple pthread_detach() calls on
the same target thread is unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the call succeeds, pthread_detach()
shall return 0; otherwise, an error number shall be returned
to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_detach() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The implementation has detected that the value
specified by thread does not refer to a joinable thread.</p>

<p>ESRCH No thread could be found corresponding to that
specified by the given thread ID.</p>

<p>The pthread_detach() function shall not return an error
code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pthread_join() or pthread_detach()
functions should eventually be called for every thread that
is created so that storage associated with the thread may be
reclaimed.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that a &quot;detach&quot; function
is not necessary; the detachstate thread creation attribute
is sufficient, since a thread need never be dynamically
detached. However, need arises in at least two cases:</p>

<p>1. In a cancellation handler for a pthread_join() it is
nearly essen- tial to have a pthread_detach() function in
order to detach the thread on which pthread_join() was
waiting. Without it, it would be necessary to have the
handler do another pthread_join() to attempt to detach the
thread, which would both delay the cancellation processing
for an unbounded period and introduce a new call to
pthread_join(), which might itself need a cancellation
handler. A dynamic detach is nearly essential in this
case.</p>

<p>2. In order to detach the &quot;initial thread&quot; (as
may be desirable in processes that set up server
threads).</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
