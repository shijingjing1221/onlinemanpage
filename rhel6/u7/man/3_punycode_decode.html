<p>NAME punycode_decode - API function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;punycode.h&gt;</p>

<p>int punycode_decode(size_t input_length, const char []
input, size_t * output_length, punycode_uint [] output,
unsigned char [] case_flags);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS size_t input_length The number of ASCII code
points in the input array.</p>

<p>const char [] input An array of ASCII code points
(0..7F).</p>

<p>size_t * output_length The caller passes in the maximum
number of code points that it can receive into the output
array (which is also the maximum number of flags that it can
receive into the case_flags array, if case_flags is not a
NULL pointer). On successful return it will contain the
number of code points actually output (which is also the
number of flags actually output, if case_flags is not a null
pointer). The decoder will never need to output more code
points than the number of ASCII code points in the input,
because of the way the encoding is defined. The number of
code points output can- not exceed the maximum possible
value of a punycode_uint, even if the supplied output_length
is greater than that.</p>

<p>punycode_uint [] output An array of code points like the
input argument of puny- code_encode() (see above).</p>

<p>unsigned char [] case_flags A NULL pointer (if the flags
are not needed by the caller) or an array of boolean values
parallel to the output array. Nonzero (true, flagged)
suggests that the corresponding Unicode character be forced
to uppercase by the caller (if possible), and zero (false,
unflagged) suggests that it be forced to lowercase (if
possible). ASCII code points (0..7F) are output already in
the proper case, but their flags will be set appropriately
so that applying the flags would be harmless.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Converts Punycode to a sequence of code
points (presumed to be Unicode code points).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The return value can be any of the
Punycode_status values defined above. If not
PUNYCODE_SUCCESS, then output_length, output, and case_flags
might contain garbage.</p>
