<p>TIFFReadEncodedStrip(3TIFF)

<p>NAME TIFFReadEncodedStrip - read and decode a strip of
data from an open TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;</p>

<p>tsize_t TIFFReadEncodedStrip(TIFF *tif, tstrip_t strip,
tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Read the specified strip of data and place
up to size bytes of decom- pressed information in the (user
supplied) data buffer.</p>

<p>NOTES The value of strip is a raw strip number. That is,
the caller must take into account whether or not the data
are organized in separate planes (PlanarConfiguration=2). To
read a full strip of data the data buffer should typically
be at least as large as the number returned by
TIFFStripSize(3TIFF). If the -1 passed in size parameter,
the whole strip will be read. You should be sure you have
enough space allocated for the buffer.</p>

<p>The library attempts to hide bit- and byte-ordering
differences between the image and the native machine by
converting data to the native machine order. Bit reversal is
done if the FillOrder tag is opposite to the native machine
bit order. 16- and 32-bit samples are automati- cally
byte-swapped if the file was written with a byte order
opposite to the native machine byte order,</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES The actual number of bytes of data that
were placed in buf is returned; TIFFReadEncodedStrip returns
-1 if an error was encountered.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error messages are directed to the
TIFFError(3TIFF) routine.</p>
