<p>PUTWC(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PUTWC(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME putwc - put a wide character on a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t putwc(wchar_t wc, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The putwc() function shall be equivalent to
fputwc(), except that if it is implemented as a macro it may
evaluate stream more than once, so the argument should never
be an expression with side effects.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to fputwc().</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fputwc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since it may be implemented as a
macro, putwc() may treat a stream argument with side effects
incorrectly. In particular, putwc(wc,*f++) need not work
correctly. Therefore, use of this function is not recom-
mended; fputwc() should be used instead.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO fputwc(), the Base Definitions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, &lt;stdio.h&gt;, &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>
