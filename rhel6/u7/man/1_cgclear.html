<p>NAME cgclear - unload the cgroup filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cgclear [-e] [-l &lt;filename&gt;] [-L
&lt;directory&gt;] [...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Without parameters, this command moves all
the tasks inside the various cgroups to the root cgroup,
deletes all the cgroups and finally unmounts the cgroup
filesystem from the system.</p>

<p>If one or more config files are specified, only groups
defined in the config files are removed. The files are
processed in reverse order, i.e. the last file on command
line is processed first, so cgclear can have the same
command line arguments as appropriate cgconfigparser.</p>

<p>-l, --load=&lt;filename&gt; specifies the config file to
read. This option can be used mul- tiple times and can be
mixed with -L option.</p>

<p>-L, --load-directory=&lt;directory&gt; specifies the
directory, which is searched for configuration files. All
files in this directory will be processed in alpha- betical
order as they were specified by -l option. This option can
be used multiple times and can be mixed with -l option.</p>

<p>-e specifies that only empty groups should be removed.
If a group defined in a config file has tasks inside or has
a subgroup, it won t be removed. This option works only with
-l or -L options.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CGROUP_LOGLEVEL controls verbosity
of the tool. Allowed values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING or
ERROR.</p>
