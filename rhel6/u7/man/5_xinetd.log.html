<p>NAME xinetd.log - xinetd service log format</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A service configuration may specify various
degrees of logging when attempts are made to access the
service. When logging for a service is enabled, xinetd will
generate one-line log entries which have the fol- lowing
format (all entries have a timestamp as a prefix):</p>

<p>entry: service-id data</p>

<p>The data depends on the entry. Possible entry types
include:</p>

<p>START generated when a server is started</p>

<p>EXIT generated when a server exits</p>

<p>FAIL generated when it is not possible to start a
server</p>

<p>USERID generated if the USERID log option is used.</p>

<p>NOID generated if the USERID log option is used, and the
IDONLY service flag is used, and the remote end does not
identify who is trying to access the service.</p>

<p>In the following, the information enclosed in brackets
appears if the appropriate log option is used.</p>

<p>A START entry has the format:</p>

<p>START: service-id [pid=%d] [from=%d.%d.%d.%d]</p>

<p>An EXIT entry has the format:</p>

<p>EXIT: service-id [type=%d] [pid=%d]
[duration=%d(sec)]</p>

<p>type can be either status or signal. The number is
either the exit status or the signal that caused process
termination.</p>

<p>A FAIL entry has the format:</p>

<p>FAIL: service-id reason [from=%d.%d.%d.%d]</p>

<p>Possible reasons are:</p>

<p>fork a certain number of consecutive fork attempts
failed (this number is a configurable parameter)</p>

<p>time the time check failed</p>

<p>address the address check failed</p>

<p>service_limit the allowed number of server instances for
this service would be exceeded</p>

<p>process_limit a limit on the number of forked processes
was specified and it would be exceeded</p>

<p>A DATA entry has the format:</p>

<p>DATA: service-id data</p>

<p>The data logged depends on the service.</p>

<p>login remote_user=%s local_user=%s tty=%s</p>

<p>exec remote_user=%s verify=status command=%s Possible
status values:</p>

<p>ok the password was correct</p>

<p>failed the password was incorrect</p>

<p>baduser no such user</p>

<p>shell remote_user=%s local_user=%s command=%s</p>

<p>finger received string or EMPTY-LINE</p>

<p>A USERID entry has the format:</p>

<p>USERID: service-id text</p>

<p>The text is the response of the identification daemon at
the remote end excluding the port numbers (which are
included in the response).</p>

<p>A NOID entry has the format:</p>

<p>NOID: service-id IP-address reason</p>
