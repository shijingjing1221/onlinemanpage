<p>NAME lwp-dump - See what headers and content is returned
for a URL</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lwp-dump [ options ] URL</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lwp-dump program will get the resource
indentified by the URL and then dump the response object to
STDOUT. This will display the headers returned and the
initial part of the content, escaped so that its safe to
display even binary content. The escapes syntax used is the
same as for Perl s double quoted strings. If there is no
content the string &quot;(no content)&quot; is shown in its
place.</p>

<p>The following options are recognized:</p>

<p>--agent str Override the user agent string passed to the
server.</p>

<p>--keep-client-headers LWP internally generate various
&quot;Client-*&quot; headers that are stripped by lwp-dump
in order to show the headers exactly as the server provided
them. This option will suppress this.</p>

<p>--max-length n How much of the content to show. The
default is 512. Set this to 0 for unlimited.</p>

<p>If the content is longer then the string is chopped at
the limit and the string &quot;...0# more bytes not
shown)&quot; appended.</p>

<p>--method str Use the given method for the request
instead of the default &quot;GET&quot;.</p>

<p>--parse-head By default lwp-dump will not try to
initialize headers by looking at the head section of HTML
documents. This option enables this. This corresponds to
&quot;parse_head&quot; in LWP::UserAgent.</p>
