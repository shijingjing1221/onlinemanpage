<p>UTIME(2) Linux Programmer s Manual UTIME(2)</p>

<p>NAME utime, utimes - change file last access and
modification times</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;utime.h&gt;</p>

<p>int utime(const char *filename, const struct utimbuf
*times);</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int utimes(const char *filename, const struct timeval
times[2]);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The utime() system call changes the access
and modification times of the inode specified by filename to
the actime and modtime fields of times respectively.</p>

<p>If times is NULL, then the access and modification times
of the file are set to the current time.</p>

<p>Changing timestamps is permitted when: either the
process has appropri- ate privileges, or the effective user
ID equals the user ID of the file, or times is NULL and the
process has write permission for the file.</p>

<p>The utimbuf structure is:</p>

<p>struct utimbuf { time_t actime; /* access time */ time_t
modtime; /* modification time */ };</p>

<p>The utime() system call allows specification of
timestamps with a reso- lution of 1 second.</p>

<p>The utimes() system call is similar, but the times
argument refers to an array rather than a structure. The
elements of this array are timeval structures, which allow a
precision of 1 microsecond for speci- fying timestamps. The
timeval structure is:</p>

<p>struct timeval { long tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_usec; /* microseconds */ };</p>

<p>times[0] specifies the new access time, and times[1]
specifies the new modification time. If times is NULL, then
analogously to utime(), the access and modification times of
the file are set to the current time.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Search permission is denied for one of the
directories in the path prefix of path (see also
path_resolution(7)).</p>

<p>EACCES times is NULL, the callers effective user ID does
not match the owner of the file, the caller does not have
write access to the file, and the caller is not privileged
(Linux: does not have either the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE or the
CAP_FOWNER capability).</p>

<p>ENOENT filename does not exist.</p>

<p>EPERM times is not NULL, the callers effective UID does
not match the owner of the file, and the caller is not
privileged (Linux: does not have the CAP_FOWNER
capability).</p>

<p>EROFS path resides on a read-only file system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO utime(): SVr4, POSIX.1-2001. POSIX.1-2008
marks utime() as obsolete. utimes(): 4.3BSD,
POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Linux does not allow changing the timestamps on an
immutable file, or setting the timestamps to something other
than the current time on an append-only file.</p>

<p>In libc4 and libc5, utimes() is just a wrapper for
utime() and hence does not allow a subsecond resolution.</p>
