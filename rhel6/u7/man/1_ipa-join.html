<p>NAME ipa-join - Join a machine to an IPA realm and get a
keytab for the host service principal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-join [-d|--debug] [-q|--quiet]
[-u|--unenroll] [-h|--hostname host- name] [-s|--server
hostame] [-k|--keytab filename] [-w|--bindpw pass- word]
[-b|--basedn basedn] [-?|--help] [--usage]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Joins a host to an IPA realm and retrieves a
kerberos keytab for the host service principal, or unenrolls
an enrolled host from an IPA server.</p>

<p>Kerberos keytabs are used for services (like sshd) to
perform kerberos authentication. A keytab is a file with one
or more secrets (or keys) for a kerberos principal.</p>

<p>The ipa-join command will create and retrieve a service
principal for host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM and place it
by default into /etc/krb5.keytab. The location can be
overridden with the -k option.</p>

<p>The IPA server to contact is set in
/etc/ipa/default.conf by default and can be overridden using
the -s,--server option.</p>

<p>In order to join the machine needs to be authenticated.
This can happen in one of two ways:</p>

<p>* Authenticate using the current kerberos principal</p>

<p>* Provide a password to authenticate with</p>

<p>If a client host has already been joined to the IPA
realm the ipa-join command will fail. The host will need to
be removed from the server using ipa host-del FQDN in order
to join the client to the realm.</p>

<p>This command is normally executed by the
ipa-client-install command as part of the enrollment
process.</p>

<p>The reverse is unenrollment. Unenrolling a host removes
the Kerberos key on the IPA server. This prepares the host
to be re-enrolled. This uses the host principal stored in
/etc/krb5.conf to authenticate to the IPA server to perform
the unenrollment.</p>

<p>Please note, that while the ipa-join option removes the
client from the domain, it does not actually uninstall the
client or properly remove all of the IPA-related
configuration. The only way to uninstall a client completely
is to use ipa-client-install --uninstall (see
ipa-client-install(1)).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h,--hostname hostname The hostname of this
server (FQDN). By default of nodename from uname(2) is
used.</p>

<p>-s,--server server The hostname of the IPA server
(FQDN). Note that by default there is no
/etc/ipa/default.conf, in most cases it needs to be
supplied.</p>

<p>-k,--keytab keytab-file The keytab file where to append
the new key (will be created if it does not exist). Default:
/etc/krb5.keytab</p>

<p>-w,--bindpw password The password to use if not using
Kerberos to authenticate. Use a password of this particular
host (one time password created on IPA server)</p>

<p>-b,--basedn basedn The basedn of the IPA server (of the
form dc=example,dc=com). This is only needed when not using
Kerberos to authenticate and anonymous binds are disallowed
in the IPA LDAP server.</p>

<p>-f,--force Force enrolling the host even if host entry
exists.</p>

<p>-u,--unenroll Unenroll this host from the IPA server. No
keytab entry is removed in the process (see
ipa-rmkeytab(1)).</p>

<p>-q,--quiet Quiet mode. Only errors are displayed.</p>

<p>-d,--debug Print the raw XML-RPC output in GSSAPI
mode.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab with
kerberos credentials.</p>

<p># kinit admin # ipa-join</p>

<p>Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab using a one-time
password.</p>

<p># ipa-join -w secret123</p>

<p>Join IPA domain and save the keytab in another
location.</p>

<p># ipa-join -k /tmp/host.keytab</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status is 0 on success, nonzero on
error.</p>

<p>0 Success</p>

<p>1 Kerberos context initialization failed</p>

<p>2 Incorrect usage</p>

<p>3 Out of memory</p>

<p>4 Invalid service principal name</p>

<p>5 No Kerberos credentials cache</p>

<p>6 No Kerberos principal and no bind DN and password</p>

<p>7 Failed to open keytab</p>

<p>8 Failed to create key material</p>

<p>9 Setting keytab failed</p>

<p>10 Bind password required when using a bind DN</p>

<p>11 Failed to add key to keytab</p>

<p>12 Failed to close keytab</p>

<p>13 Host is already enrolled</p>

<p>14 LDAP failure</p>

<p>15 Incorrect bulk password</p>

<p>16 Host name must be fully-qualified</p>

<p>17 XML-RPC fault</p>

<p>18 Principal not found in host entry</p>

<p>19 Unable to generate Kerberos credentials cache</p>

<p>20 Unenrollment result not in XML-RPC response</p>

<p>21 Failed to get default Kerberos realm</p>
