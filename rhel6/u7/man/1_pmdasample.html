<p>NAME pmdasample - sample performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pmdasample [-d domain] [-i port]
[-l logfile] [-p] [-u socket] [-U username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdasample is a sample Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports a variety of synthetic
performance metrics.</p>

<p>This PMDA was developed as part of the quality assurance
testing for the PCP product, but has other uses, most
notably in the development of new PCP clients.</p>

<p>The metrics exported by the sample PMDA cover the full
range of data types, data semantics, value cardinality,
instance domain stability and error conditions found in real
PMDAs.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdasample command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-i Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasample on the specified
TCP/IP port. port may be a port number or port name.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named sample.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdasample is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-p Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
pmdasample is via standard input and standard output. This
is the default con- nection mode.</p>

<p>-u Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasample on the Unix
domain socket named socket.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>At most one of the options -i, -p and -u may be
specified.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the sample performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample # ./Install</p>

<p>Note that the installation script also installs the DSO
version of the sample PMDA, so there are in fact two PMDAs
installed, and two sets of performance metrics, namely
sample.* and sampledso.*.</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation (and remove both
PMDAs), do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdasample is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdasample $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/help default help
text file for the sample metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/Install installation script for the
pmdasample agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdasample agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/sample.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdasample</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
