<p>USB_EP_FIFO_STATUS(9) Kernel Mode Gadget API
USB_EP_FIFO_STATUS(9)</p>

<p>NAME usb_ep_fifo_status - returns number of bytes in
fifo, or error</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int usb_ep_fifo_status(struct usb_ep * ep);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS ep the endpoint whose fifo status is being
checked.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FIFO endpoints may have unclaimed data in
them in certain cases, such as after aborted transfers.
Hosts may not have collected all the IN data written by the
gadget driver (and reported by a request completion). The
gadget driver may not have collected all the data written
OUT to it by the host. Drivers that need precise handling
for fault reporting or recovery may need to use this
call.</p>

<p>This returns the number of such bytes in the fifo, or a
negative errno if the endpoint doesn&acute;t use a FIFO or
doesn&acute;t support such precise handling.</p>
