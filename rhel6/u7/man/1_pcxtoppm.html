<p>NAME pcxtoppm - convert a PCX file into a PPM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pcxtoppm [-stdpalette] [-verbose] [pcxfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pcxtoppm reads a PCX file as input and produces a PPM
image as output.</p>

<p>pcxtoppm recognizes the following PCX types:</p>

<p>&middot; Colormapped files with 2-16 colors.</p>

<p>Packed pixel format (1, 2 or 4 bits/pixel, 1 plane) or
bit- plane format (1 bit/pixel, 1-4 planes). The program
uses a pre- defined standard palette if the image does not
provide one. Does not provide one means the palette in the
PCX header is completely black.</p>

<p>&middot; Colormapped files with 256 colors.</p>

<p>8 bits/pixel, 1 plane, colormap at the end of the
file.</p>

<p>&middot; 24bit truecolor files.</p>

<p>24bit RGB: 8 bits/pixel, 3 planes.</p>

<p>&middot; 32bit truecolor files.</p>

<p>24bit RGB + 8bit intensity: 8 bits/pixel, 4 planes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -stdpalette This option causes pcxtoppm to use
its predefined standard palette even if the PCX image
provides its own. This is mean- ingful only for an image in
the 16 color paletted PCX format.</p>

<p>The image may appear to provide its own palette but in
fact be created by a program too primitive to understand
palettes that created a random palette by accident.</p>
