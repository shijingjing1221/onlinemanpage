call)</p>

<p>NAME XmStringNConcat A compound string function that
appends a specified number of bytes to a compound string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; XmString
XmStringNConcat( XmString s1, XmString s2, int
num_bytes);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function is obsolete and exists for
compatibility with previous releases. It is replaced by
XmStringConcat. XmStringNConcat appends a specified number
of bytes from s2 to the end of s1, including tags,
directional indicators, and separators. It then returns the
resulting compound string. The original strings are
preserved. The function allocates space for the resulting
compound string. The application is responsible for managing
the allocated space. The application can recover the
allocated space by calling XmStringFree.</p>

<p>s1 Specifies the compound string to which a copy of s2
is appended.</p>

<p>s2 Specifies the compound string that is appended to the
end of s1.</p>

<p>num_bytes Specifies the number of bytes of s2 to append
to s1. If this value is less than the length of s2, as many
bytes as possi- ble, but possibly fewer than this value,
will be appended to s1 such that the resulting string is
still a valid compound string.</p>

<p>RETURN Returns a new compound string.</p>
