<p>NAME netrc, .netrc - user configuration for ftp</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file contains configuration and
autologin information for the File Transfer Protocol client
ftp(1).</p>

<p>The .netrc file contains login and initialization
information used by the auto-login process. It resides in
the users home directory. The fol- lowing tokens are
recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs, or
new-lines:</p>

<p>machine name Identify a remote machine name. The
auto-login process searches the .netrc file for a machine
token that matches the remote machine specified on the ftp
command line or as an open command argument. Once a match is
made, the subsequent .netrc tokens are processed, stopping
when the end of file is reached or another machine or a
default token is encountered.</p>

<p>default This is the same as machine name except that
default matches any name. There can be only one default
token, and it must be after all machine tokens. This is
normally used as:</p>

<p>default login anonymous password user@site</p>

<p>thereby giving the user automatic anonymous ftp login to
machines not specified in .netrc. This can be overridden by
using the -n flag to disable auto-login.</p>

<p>login name Identify a user on the remote machine. If
this token is present, the auto-login process will initiate
a login using the specified name.</p>

<p>password string Supply a password. If this token is
present, the auto-login process will supply the specified
string if the remote server requires a password as part of
the login process. Note that if this token is present in the
.netrc file for any user other than anonymous, ftp will
abort the auto-login process if the .netrc is readable by
anyone besides the user.</p>

<p>account string Supply an additional account password. If
this token is present, the auto-login process will supply
the specified string if the remote server requires an
additional account password, or the auto-login process will
initiate an ACCT com- mand if it does not.</p>

<p>macdef name Define a macro. This token functions like
the ftp macdef com- mand functions. A macro is defined with
the specified name; its contents begin with the next .netrc
line and continue until a null line (consecutive new-line
characters) is encountered. If a macro named init is
defined, it is automatically executed as the last step in
the auto-login process.</p>
