<p>WCSNCAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSNCAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcsncat - concatenate a wide-character string with
part of another</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcsncat(wchar_t *restrict ws1, const wchar_t
*restrict ws2, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsncat() function shall append not more
than n wide-character codes (a null wide-character code and
wide-character codes that follow it are not appended) from
the array pointed to by ws2 to the end of the wide-character
string pointed to by ws1. The initial wide-character code of
ws2 shall overwrite the null wide-character code at the end
of ws1. A terminating null wide-character code shall always
be appended to the result. If copying takes place between
objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcsncat() function shall return ws1; no
return value is reserved to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
