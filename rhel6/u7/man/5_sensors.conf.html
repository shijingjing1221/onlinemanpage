<p>NAME sensors.conf - libsensors configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sensors.conf describes how libsensors, and
so all programs using it, should translate the raw readings
from the kernel modules to real-world values.</p>

<p>SEMANTICS On a given system, there may be one or more
hardware monitoring chips. Each chip may have several
features. For example, the LM78 monitors 7 voltage inputs, 3
fans and one temperature. Feature names are standard- ized.
Typical feature names are in0, in1, in2... for voltage
inputs, fan1, fan2, fan3... for fans and temp1, temp2,
temp3... for temperature inputs.</p>

<p>Each feature may in turn have one or more sub-features,
each represent- ing an attribute of the feature: input
value, low limit, high limit, alarm, etc. Sub-feature names
are standardized as well. For example, the first voltage
input (in0) would typically have sub-features in0_input
(measured value), in0_min (low limit), in0_max (high limit)
and in0_alarm (alarm flag). Which sub-features are actually
present depend on the exact chip type.</p>

<p>The sensors.conf configuration file will let you
configure each chip, feature and sub-feature in a way that
makes sense for your system.</p>

<p>The rest of this section describes the meaning of each
configuration statement.</p>

<p>CHIP STATEMENT A chip statement selects for which chips
all following compute, label, ignore and set statements are
meant. A chip selection remains valid until the next chip
statement. Example:</p>

<p>chip &quot;lm78-*&quot; &quot;lm79-*&quot;</p>

<p>If a chip matches at least one of the chip descriptions,
the following configuration lines are examined for it,
otherwise they are ignored.</p>

<p>A chip description is built from several elements,
separated by dashes. The first element is the chip type, the
second element is the name of the bus, and the third element
is the hexadecimal address of the chip. Such chip
descriptions are printed by sensors(1) as the first line for
every chip.</p>

<p>The name of the bus is either isa, pci, virtual, spi-*
or i2c-N with N being a bus number as bound with a bus
statement. This list isnt nec- essarily exhaustive as
support for other bus types may be added in the future.</p>

<p>You may substitute the wildcard operator * for every
element. Note how- ever that it wouldnt make any sense to
specify the address without the bus type, so the address
part is plain omitted when the bus type isnt specified. Here
is how you would express the following matches:</p>

<p>LM78 chip at address 0x2d on I2C bus 1 lm78-i2c-1-2d</p>

<p>LM78 chip at address 0x2d on any I2C bus lm78-i2c-*-2d
LM78 chip at address 0x290 on the ISA bus lm78-isa-0290 Any
LM78 chip on I2C bus 1 lm78-i2c-1-* Any LM78 on any I2C bus
lm78-i2c-*-* Any LM78 chip on the ISA bus lm78-isa-* Any
LM78 chip lm78-* Any chip at address 0x2d on I2C bus 1
*-i2c-1-2d Any chip at address 0x290 on the ISA bus
*-isa-0290</p>

<p>If several chip statements match a specific chip, they
are all consid- ered.</p>

<p>LABEL STATEMENT A label statement describes how a
feature should be called. Features without a label statement
are just called by their feature name. Appli- cations can
use this to label the readings they present. Example:</p>

<p>label in3 &quot;+5V&quot;</p>

<p>The first argument is the feature name. The second
argument is the fea- ture description.</p>

<p>IGNORE STATEMENT An ignore statement is a hint that a
specific feature should be ignored - probably because it
returns bogus values (for example, because a fan or
temperature sensor is not connected). Example:</p>

<p>ignore fan1</p>

<p>The only argument is the feature name. Please note that
this does not disable anything in the actual sensor chip; it
simply hides the feature in question from libsensors
users.</p>

<p>COMPUTE STATEMENT A compute statement describes how a
feature s raw value should be translated to a real-world
value, and how a real-world value should be translated back
to a raw value again. This is most useful for voltage
sensors, because in general sensor chips have a limited
range and volt- ages outside this range must be divided
(using resistors) before they can be monitored. Example:</p>

<p>compute in3 ((6.8/10)+1)*@, @/((6.8/10)+1)</p>

<p>The example above expresses the fact that the voltage
input is divided using two resistors of values 6.8 Ohm and
10 Ohm, respectively. See the VOLTAGE COMPUTATION DETAILS
section below for details.</p>

<p>The first argument is the feature name. The second
argument is an expression which specifies how a raw value
must be translated to a real-world value; @ stands here for
the raw value. This is the for- mula which will be applied
when reading values from the chip. The third argument is an
expression that specifies how a real-world value should be
translated back to a raw value; @ stands here for the
real-world value. This is the formula which will be applied
when writing values to the chip. The two formulas are
obviously related, and are separated by a comma.</p>

<p>A compute statement applies to all sub-features of the
target feature for which it makes sense. For example, the
above example would affect sub-features in3_min and in3_max
(which are voltage values) but not in3_alarm (which is a
boolean flag.)</p>

<p>The following operators are supported in compute
statements: + - * / ( ) ^ ^x means exp(x) and x means
ln(x).</p>

<p>You may use the name of sub-features in these
expressions; current readings are substituted. You should be
careful though to avoid circu- lar references.</p>

<p>If at any moment a translation between a raw and a
real-world value is called for, but no compute statement
applies, a one-on-one translation is used instead.</p>

<p>SET STATEMENT A set statement is used to write a
sub-feature value to the chip. Of course not all sub-feature
values can be set that way, in particular input values and
alarm flags can not. Valid sub-features are usually min/max
limits. Example:</p>

<p>set in3_min 5 * 0.95 set in3_max 5 * 1.05</p>

<p>The example above basically configures the chip to allow
a 5% deviance for the +5V power input.</p>

<p>The first argument is the feature name. The second
argument is an expression which determines the written
value. If there is an applying compute statement, this value
is fed to its third argument to translate it to a raw
value.</p>

<p>You may use the name of sub-features in these
expressions; current readings are substituted. You should be
careful though to avoid circu- lar references.</p>

<p>Please note that set statements are only executed by
sensors(1) when you use the -s option. Typical graphical
sensors applications do not care about these statements at
all.</p>

<p>BUS STATEMENT A bus statement binds the description of
an I2C or SMBus adapter to a bus number. This makes it
possible to refer to an adapter in the con- figuration file,
independent of the actual correspondence of bus num- bers
and actual adapters (which may change from moment to
moment). Example:</p>

<p>bus &quot;i2c-0&quot; &quot;SMBus PIIX4 adapter at
e800&quot;</p>

<p>The first argument is the bus number. It is the literal
text i2c-, fol- lowed by a number. As there is a dash in
this argument, it must always be quoted.</p>

<p>The second argument is the adapter name, it must match
exactly the adapter name as it appears in
/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-*/name. It should always be
quoted as well as it will most certainly contain spaces or
dashes.</p>

<p>The bus statements may be scattered randomly throughout
the configura- tion file; there is no need to place the bus
line before the place where its binding is referred to.
Still, as a matter of good style, we suggest you place all
bus statements together at the top of your con- figuration
file.</p>

<p>Running sensors --bus-list will generate these lines for
you.</p>

<p>In the case where multiple configuration files are used,
the scope of each bus statement is the configuration file it
was defined in. This makes it possible to have bus
statements in all configuration files which will not
unexpectedly interfere with each other.</p>

<p>STATEMENT ORDER Statements can go in any order, however
it is recommended to put set fanX_div statements before set
fanX_min statements, in case a driver doesn t preserve the
fanX_min setting when the fanX_div value is changed. Even if
the driver does, its still better to put the state- ments in
this order to avoid accuracy loss.</p>

<p>VOLTAGE COMPUTATION DETAILS Most voltage sensors in
sensor chips have a range of 0 to 4.08 V. This is generally
sufficient for the +3.3V and CPU supply voltages, so the
sensor chip reading is the actual voltage.</p>

<p>Other supply voltages must be scaled with an external
resistor network. The driver reports the value at the chips
pin (0 - 4.08 V), and the userspace application must convert
this raw value to an actual voltage. The compute statements
provide this facility.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the resistor values vary among motherboard
types. There- fore you have to figure out the correct
resistor values for your own motherboard.</p>

<p>For positive voltages (typically +5V and +12V), two
resistors are used, with the following formula: R1 = R2 *
(Vs/Vin - 1)</p>

<p>where: R1 and R2 are the resistor values Vs is the
actual voltage being monitored Vin is the voltage at the
pin</p>

<p>This leads to the following compute formula: compute inX
@*((R1/R2)+1), @/(((R1/R2)+1)</p>

<p>Real-world formula for +5V and +12V would look like:
compute in3 @*((6.8/10)+1), @/((6.8/10)+1) compute in4
@*((28/10)+1), @/((28/10)+1)</p>

<p>For negative voltages (typically -5V and -12V), two
resistors are used as well, but different boards use
different strategies to bring the voltage value into the 0 -
4.08 V range. Some use an inverting ampli- fier, others use
a positive reference voltage. This leads to different
computation formulas. Note that most users wont have to care
because most modern motherboards make little use of -12V and
no use of -5V so they do not bother monitoring these voltage
inputs.</p>

<p>Real-world examples for the inverting amplifier case:
compute in5 -@*(240/60), -@/(240/60) compute in6
-@*(100/60), -@/(100/60)</p>

<p>Real-world examples for the positive voltage reference
case: compute in5 @*(1+232/56) - 4.096*232/56, (@ +
4.096*232/56)/(1+232/56) compute in6 @*(1+120/56) -
4.096*120/56, (@ + 4.096*120/56)/(1+120/56)</p>

<p>Many recent monitoring chips have a 0 - 2.04 V range, so
scaling resis- tors are even more needed, and resistor
values are different.</p>

<p>There are also a few chips out there which have internal
scaling resis- tors, meaning that their value is known and
doesnt change from one motherboard to the next. For these
chips, the driver usually handles the scaling so it is
transparent to the user and no compute statements are
needed.</p>

<p>TEMPERATURE CONFIGURATION On top of the usual features,
temperatures can have two specific sub-features: temperature
sensor type (tempX_type) and hysteresis val- ues
(tempX_max_hyst and tempX_crit_hyst).</p>

<p>THERMAL SENSOR TYPES Available thermal sensor types:</p>

<p>1 PII/Celeron Diode 2 3904 transistor 3 thermal diode 4
thermistor 5 AMD AMDSI 6 Intel PECI</p>

<p>For example, to set temp1 to thermistor type, use:</p>

<p>set temp1_type 4</p>

<p>Only certain chips support thermal sensor type change,
and even these usually only support some of the types above.
Please refer to the spe- cific driver documentation to find
out which types are supported by your chip.</p>

<p>In theory, the BIOS should have configured the sensor
types correctly, so you shouldnt have to touch them, but
sometimes it isn t the case.</p>

<p>THERMAL HYSTERESIS MECHANISM Many monitoring chips do
not handle the high and critical temperature limits as
simple limits. Instead, they have two values for each limit,
one which triggers an alarm when the temperature rises and
another one which clears the alarm when the temperature
falls. The latter is typi- cally a few degrees below the
former. This mechanism is known as hys- teresis.</p>

<p>The reason for implementing things that way is that high
temperature alarms typically trigger an action to attempt to
cool the system down, either by scaling down the CPU
frequency, or by kicking in an extra fan. This should
normally let the temperature fall in a timely manner. If
this was clearing the alarm immediately, then the system
would be back to its original state where the temperature
rises and the alarm would immediately trigger again, causing
an undesirable tight fan on, fan off loop. The hysteresis
mechanism ensures that the system is really cool before the
fan stops, so that it will not have to kick in again
immediately.</p>

<p>So, in addition to tempX_max, many chips have a
tempX_max_hyst sub-fea- ture. Likewise, tempX_crit often
comes with tempX_max_crit. Example:</p>

<p>set temp1_max 60 set temp1_max_hyst 56</p>

<p>The hysteresis mechanism can be disabled by giving both
limits the same value.</p>

<p>BEEPS Some chips support alarms with beep warnings. When
an alarm is trig- gered you can be warned by a beeping
signal through your computer speaker. On top of per-feature
beep flags, there is usually a master beep control switch to
enable or disable beeping globally. Enable beep- ing
using:</p>

<p>set beep_enable 1</p>

<p>or disable it using:</p>

<p>set beep_enable 0</p>

<p>WHICH STATEMENT APPLIES If more than one statement of
the same kind applies at a certain moment, the last one in
the configuration file is used. So usually, you should put
more general chip statements at the top, so you can overrule
them below.</p>

<p>SYNTAX Comments are introduced by hash marks. A comment
continues to the end of the line. Empty lines, and lines
containing only whitespace or com- ments are ignored. Other
lines have one of the below forms. There must be whitespace
between each element, but the amount of whitespace is
unimportant. A line may be continued on the next line by
ending it with a backslash; this does not work within a
comment, NAME or NUMBER.</p>

<p>bus NAME NAME NAME chip NAME-LIST label NAME NAME
compute NAME EXPR , EXPR ignore NAME set NAME EXPR</p>

<p>A NAME is a string. If it only contains letters, digits
and under- scores, it does not have to be quoted; in all
other cases, you must use double quotes around it. Within
quotes, you can use the normal escape-codes from C.</p>

<p>A NAME-LIST is one or more NAME items behind each other,
separated by whitespace.</p>

<p>A EXPR is of one of the below forms:</p>

<p>NUMBER NAME @ EXPR + EXPR EXPR - EXPR EXPR * EXPR EXPR /
EXPR - EXPR ^ EXPR EXPR ( EXPR )</p>

<p>A NUMBER is a floating-point number. 10, 10.4 and .4 are
examples of valid floating-point numbers; 10. or 10E4 are
not valid.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sensors3.conf /etc/sensors.conf The
system-wide libsensors(3) configuration file. /etc/sen-
sors3.conf is tried first, and if it doesn t exist,
/etc/sen- sors.conf is used instead.</p>

<p>/etc/sensors.d A directory where you can put additional
libsensors configura- tion files. Files found in this
directory will be processed in alphabetical order after the
default configuration file. Files with names that start with
a dot are ignored.</p>
