<p>NAME pmdazswap - zswap (compressed swap) PMDA</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdazswap is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values about compressed
swap operation, as tracked by the zswap Linux kernel
module.</p>

<p>Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages.
It takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out
and attempts to compress them into a dynamically allocated
RAM-based memory pool. Zswap trades CPU cycles for
potentially reduced swap I/O. This tradeoff can also result
in a performance improvement if reads from the compressed
cache are faster than reads from a swap device.</p>

<p>This PMDA exports metrics about pool size, number of
pages stored, and various counters for the reasons pages are
rejected.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Install the zswap PMDA by using the Install
script as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap # ./Install</p>

<p>To uninstall, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdazswap is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap/Install installation script
for the pmdazswap agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap/Remove undo installation script for
the pmdazswap agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/zswap.log default log file for error
messages from pmdazswap</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
