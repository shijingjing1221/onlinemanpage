<p>HAL-DISABLE-POLLING(1) HAL-DISABLE-POLLING(1)</p>

<p>NAME hal-disable-polling - disable polling on drives
with removable media</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hal-disable-polling [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION hal-disable-polling can be used to to
disable and enable media detec- tion on drives with
removable storage. For more information about both the big
picture and specific HAL properties, refer to the HAL spec
which can be found in
/usr/share/doc/hal-0.5.14/spec/hal-spec.html depending on
the distribution.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>--udi The UDI (Unique Device Identifier) of the device
object.</p>

<p>--device The device file of the drive.</p>

<p>--enable-polling Enable polling instead of disabling
it.</p>

<p>--help Print out usage.</p>

<p>--version Print the version.</p>

<p>NOTES This program requires super user privileges.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the requested operation was successful,
this program will exit with exit code 0.</p>

<p>HISTORY Polling a storage drive is a necessary evil to
detect when the user inserts or removes media. Human
computer interaction studies have shown that a broad class
of users expect their system to react within a few seconds
of this. Thus, the hald daemon polls through the hald-addon-
storage addon (one instance for each drive with removable
media).</p>

<p>The purpose of the hald-addon-storage addon is simply to
open the spe- cial device file at a regular interval (either
every 2 or every 16 sec- onds) to check for new media. This
program tries to open the device file using the O_EXCL
option which means that programs like cdrecord(1) that uses
O_EXCL automatically prevents the hald-addon-storage for
interferring by continously opening the device file. In
addition, if the drive is locked using HAL (see hal-lock(1))
the addon also stops polling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, polling a storage drive can have adverse
side effects if the hardware and/or device driver for the
hardware is malfunctioning. Additionally, the operating
system kernel itself may offer multiple interfaces for the
same device (e.g. /dev/sg0 and /dev/scd0) so even O_EXCL won
t work. Also, polling a drive may decrease throughput in
certain (odd and/or broken) configurations; for example, if
two IDE drives shares the same host (master/slave), bus
traffic and contention caused by polling e.g. the optical
drive (slave) can reduce throughput to the hard disk
(master) and/or interfere with CD burning on another optical
drive (master). Finally, polling a drive incurs an overhead
both in the host system (processes get woken up often,
preventing the CPU to stay in a deep power saving states)
and it may prevent the actual drive from reaching deep power
states as well. As a result, more power is consumed and this
affects battery life for laptops.</p>

<p>Despite the existence of support for asynchronous media
change notifi- cation in recent MMC (Multi-Media Commands)
specifications, virtually no optical drives are compliant
with the specification. Fortunately newer SATA ATAPI
hardware seems to support Asynchronous Notification (AN) and
at this time of writing (March 2007) work is underway to
make both the Linux operating system kernel and HAL take
advantage of this.</p>

<p>It is the position of the HAL team that polling should
be avoided at all costs as long as it doesnt heavily impact
the user experience in a negative way. This tool is provided
as a stop-gap measure to use if a system is rendered useless
due to bugs in drivers and/or hardware that is provoked by
HAL polling the drive. If such a bug is encountered it
should be reported (see the BUGS section below) so it can be
fixed - historically hald have triggered a number of bugs in
Linux storage drivers and related subsystems (such as USB)
that have later been fixed.</p>
