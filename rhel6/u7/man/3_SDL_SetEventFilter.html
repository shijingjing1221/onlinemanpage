<p>SDL_SetEventFilter(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_SetEventFilter(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_SetEventFilter - Sets up a filter to process
all events before they are posted to the event queue.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>void SDL_SetEventFilter(SDL_EventFilter filter);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function sets up a filter to process
all events before they are posted to the event queue. This
is a very powerful and flexible fea- ture. The filter is
prototyped as:</p>

<p>typedef int (*SDL_EventFilter)(const SDL_Event
*event);</p>

<p>If the filter returns 1, then the event will be added to
the internal queue. If it returns 0, then the event will be
dropped from the queue. This allows selective filtering of
dynamically.</p>

<p>There is one caveat when dealing with the SDL_QUITEVENT
event type. The event filter is only called when the window
manager desires to close the application window. If the
event filter returns 1, then the window will be closed,
otherwise the window will remain open if possible. If the
quit event is generated by an interrupt signal, it will
bypass the internal queue and be delivered to the
application at the next event poll.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Events pushed onto the queue with SDL_PushEvent or
SDL_Peep- Events do not get passed through the event
filter.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Be Careful! The event filter function may run in a
different thread so be careful what you do within it.</p>
