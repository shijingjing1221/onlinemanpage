<p>rlm_realm(5) FreeRADIUS Module rlm_realm(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_realm - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_realm module parses the User-Name
attribute into a User section and a Realm section. This is
used primarily in a proxy situation, how- ever, Realms can
also be used locally to provide different service pro- files
based on the Realm being used.</p>

<p>The main configuration items to be aware of are:</p>

<p>format This can be either prefix or suffix. It specifies
whether the Realm is before or after the User portion in the
User-Name string.</p>

<p>delimiter A single character in quotes, which is used as
the delimiting character that separates the Realm and User
sections of the string.</p>

<p>ignore_default This is set to either yes or no. If set
to yes, this will prevent the module instance from matching
a realm against the DEFAULT entry. This may be useful if you
have multiple realm module instances. The default is no.</p>

<p>ignore_null This is set to either yes or no. If set to
yes , this will prevent the module instance from matching a
realm against the NULL entry. This may be useful if you have
multiple realm mod- ule instances. The default is no.</p>

<p>This module parses the realm from the User-Name
attrbiute according to the instance configuration, and then
performs a lookup to find a match- ing realm in the
/etc/raddb/proxy.conf file. Depending on the con- figuration
of the Realm as matched in the file, the username may be
rewritten in a stripped format, or with the Realm portion
removed. In either case, a Realm attribute is created and
added to the packet on a match, which can be used by other
modules.</p>
