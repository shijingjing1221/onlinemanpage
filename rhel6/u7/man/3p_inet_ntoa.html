<p>INET_ADDR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
INET_ADDR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME inet_addr, inet_ntoa - IPv4 address
manipulation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</p>

<p>in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp); char
*inet_ntoa(struct in_addr in);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The inet_addr() function shall convert the
string pointed to by cp, in the standard IPv4 dotted decimal
notation, to an integer value suitable for use as an
Internet address.</p>

<p>The inet_ntoa() function shall convert the Internet host
address speci- fied by in to a string in the Internet
standard dot notation.</p>

<p>The inet_ntoa() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>All Internet addresses shall be returned in network
order (bytes ordered from left to right).</p>

<p>Values specified using IPv4 dotted decimal notation take
one of the following forms:</p>

<p>a.b.c.d When four parts are specified, each shall be
interpreted as a byte of data and assigned, from left to
right, to the four bytes of an Internet address.</p>

<p>a.b.c When a three-part address is specified, the last
part shall be interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in
the rightmost two bytes of the network address. This makes
the three-part address format convenient for specifying
Class B network addresses as &quot;128.net.host&quot; .</p>

<p>a.b When a two-part address is supplied, the last part
shall be interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the
rightmost three bytes of the network address. This makes the
two-part address format convenient for specifying Class A
network addresses as &quot;net.host&quot; .</p>

<p>a When only one part is given, the value shall be stored
directly in the network address without any byte
rearrangement.</p>

<p>All numbers supplied as parts in IPv4 dotted decimal
notation may be decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, as specified
in the ISO C standard (that is, a leading 0x or 0X implies
hexadecimal; otherwise, a leading 0implies octal; otherwise,
the number is interpreted as decimal).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, inet_addr()
shall return the Internet address. Otherwise, it shall
return ( in_addr_t)(-1).</p>

<p>The inet_ntoa() function shall return a pointer to the
network address in Internet standard dot notation.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The return value of inet_ntoa() may
point to static data that may be overwritten by subsequent
calls to inet_ntoa().</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
