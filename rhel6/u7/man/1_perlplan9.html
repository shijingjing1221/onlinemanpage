<p>NAME perlplan9 - Plan 9-specific documentation for
Perl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These are a few notes describing features
peculiar to Plan 9 Perl. As such, it is not intended to be a
replacement for the rest of the Perl 5 documentation (which
is both copious and excellent). If you have any questions to
which you can t find answers in these man pages, contact
Luther Huffman at lutherh@stratcom.com and we ll try to
answer them.</p>

<p>Invoking Perl Perl is invoked from the command line as
described in perl. Most perl scripts, however, do have a
first line such as &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. This
is known as a shebang (shell-bang) statement and tells the
OS shell where to find the perl interpreter. In Plan 9 Perl
this statement should be &quot;#!/bin/perl&quot; if you wish
to be able to directly invoke the script by its name.
Alternatively, you may invoke perl with the command
&quot;Perl&quot; instead of &quot;perl&quot;. This will
produce Acme-friendly error messages of the form
&quot;filename:18&quot;.</p>

<p>Some scripts, usually identified with a *.PL extension,
are self- configuring and are able to correctly create their
own shebang path from config information located in Plan 9
Perl. These you wont need to be worried about.</p>

<p>Whas in Plan 9 Perl Although Plan 9 Perl currently only
provides static loading, it is built with a number of useful
extensions. These include Opcode, FileHandle, Fcntl, and
POSIX. Expect to see others (and DynaLoading!) in the
future.</p>

<p>Whas not in Plan 9 Perl As mentioned previously, dynamic
loading isn t currently available nor is MakeMaker. Both are
high-priority items.</p>

<p>Perl5 Functions not currently supported in Plan 9 Perl
Some, such as &quot;chown&quot; and &quot;umask&quot; arent
provided because the concept does not exist within Plan 9.
Others, such as some of the socket- related functions,
simply havent been written yet. Many in the latter category
may be supported in the future.</p>

<p>The functions not currently implemented include:</p>

<p>chown, chroot, dbmclose, dbmopen, getsockopt,
setsockopt, recvmsg, sendmsg, getnetbyname, getnetbyaddr,
getnetent, getprotoent, getservent, sethostent, setnetent,
setprotoent, setservent, endservent, endnetent, endprotoent,
umask</p>

<p>There may be several other functions that have undefined
behavior so this list shouldnt be considered complete.</p>

<p>Signals in Plan 9 Perl For compatibility with perl
scripts written for the Unix environment, Plan 9 Perl uses
the POSIX signal emulation provided in Plan 9s ANSI POSIX
Environment (APE). Signal stacking isnt supported. The
signals provided are:</p>

<p>SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGILL, SIGABRT, SIGFPE,
SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, SIGTERM,
SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2, SIGCHLD, SIGCONT, SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP,
SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU</p>

<p>COMPILING AND INSTALLING PERL ON PLAN 9 WELCOME to Plan
9 Perl, brave soul!</p>

<p>This is a preliminary alpha version of Plan 9 Perl.
Still to be implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many
perl commands are missing or currently behave in an
inscrutable manner. These gaps will, with perseverance and a
modicum of luck, be remedied in the near future.To install
this software:</p>

<p>1. Create the source directories and libraries for perl
by running the plan9/setup.rc command (i.e., located in the
plan9 subdirectory). Note: the setup routine assumes that
you havent dearchived these files into /sys/src/cmd/perl.
After running setup.rc you may delete the copy of the source
you originally detarred, as source code has now been
installed in /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing
perl binaries for all architectures, run &quot;setup.rc
-a&quot;.</p>

<p>2. After making sure that you have adequate privileges
to build system software, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301
(adjust version appropriately) run:</p>

<p>mk install</p>

<p>If you wish to install perl versions for all
architectures (68020, mips, sparc and 386) run:</p>

<p>mk installall</p>

<p>3. Wait. The build process will take a *long* time
because perl bootstraps itself. A 75MHz Pentium, 16MB RAM
machine takes roughly 30 minutes to build the distribution
from scratch.</p>

<p>Installing Perl Documentation on Plan 9 This perl
distribution comes with a tremendous amount of
documentation. To add these to the built-in manuals that
come with Plan 9, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust
version appropriately) run:</p>

<p>mk man</p>

<p>To begin your reading, start with:</p>

<p>man perl</p>

<p>This is a good introduction and will direct you towards
other man pages that may interest you.</p>

<p>(Note: &quot;mk man&quot; may produce some extraneous
noise. Fear not.)</p>

<p>BUGS &quot;As many as there are grains of sand on all
the beaches of the world . . .&quot; - Carl Sagan</p>

<p>Revision date This document was revised 09-October-1996
for Perl 5.003_7.</p>
