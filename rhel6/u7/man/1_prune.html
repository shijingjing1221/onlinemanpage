<p>NAME prune - Prune directed graphs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS prune [ -n node ] [ -N attrspec ] [ files ...
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION prune reads directed graphs in the same
format used by dot(1) and removes subgraphs rooted at nodes
specified on the command line via options. These nodes
themselves will not be removed, but can be given attributes
so that they can be easily located by a graph stream editor
such as gpr(1). prune correctly handles cycles, loops and
multi-edges.</p>

<p>Both options can appear multiple times on the command
line. All sub- graphs rooted at the respective nodes given
will then be processed. If a node does not exist, prune will
skip it and print a warning message to stderr. If multiple
attributes are given, they will be applied to all nodes that
have been processed. prune writes the result to the
stdout.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n name Specifies name of node to prune.</p>

<p>-N attrspec Specifies attribute that will be set (or
changed if it exists) for any pruned node. attrspec is a
string of the form attr=value.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES An input graph test.dot of the form</p>

<p>digraph DG { A -&gt; B; A -&gt; C;</p>

<p>B -&gt; D; B -&gt; E; }</p>

<p>, processed by the command</p>

<p>prune -n B test.dot</p>

<p>would produce the following output (the actual code
might be formatted in a slightly different way).</p>

<p>digraph DG { A -&gt; B; A -&gt; C; }</p>

<p>Another input graph test.dot of the form</p>

<p>digraph DG { A -&gt; B; A -&gt; C;</p>

<p>B -&gt; D; B -&gt; E;</p>

<p>C -&gt; E; }</p>

<p>(note the additional edge from C to E ), processed by
the command</p>

<p>prune -n B -N color=red test.dot</p>

<p>results in</p>

<p>digraph DG { B [color=red]; A -&gt; B; A -&gt; C; C
-&gt; E; }</p>

<p>Node E has not been removed since its second parent C is
not being pruned.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS prune returns 0 on successful completion. It
returns 1 if an error occurs.</p>
