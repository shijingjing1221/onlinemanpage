<p>GIT-FETCH(1) Git Manual GIT-FETCH(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-fetch - Download objects and refs from another
repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git fetch [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;repository&gt;
[&lt;refspec&gt;...]]</p>

<p>git fetch [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;group&gt;</p>

<p>git fetch --multiple [&lt;options&gt;]
[&lt;repository&gt; | &lt;group&gt;]...</p>

<p>git fetch --all [&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Fetches named heads or tags from one or more
other repositories, along with the objects necessary to
complete them.</p>

<p>The ref names and their object names of fetched refs are
stored in .git/FETCH_HEAD. This information is left for a
later merge operation done by git merge.</p>

<p>When &lt;refspec&gt; stores the fetched result in
tracking branches, the tags that point at these branches are
automatically followed. This is done by first fetching from
the remote using the given &lt;refspec&gt;s, and if the
repository has objects that are pointed by remote tags that
it does not yet have, then fetch those missing tags. If the
other end has tags that point at branches you are not
interested in, you will not get them.</p>

<p>git fetch can fetch from either a single named
repository, or or from several repositories at once if
&lt;group&gt; is given and there is a remotes.&lt;group&gt;
entry in the configuration file. (See git-config(1)).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all Fetch all remotes.</p>

<p>-a, --append Append ref names and object names of
fetched refs to the existing contents of .git/FETCH_HEAD.
Without this option old data in .git/FETCH_HEAD will be
overwritten.</p>

<p>--depth=&lt;depth&gt; Deepen the history of a shallow
repository created by git clone with --depth=&lt;depth&gt;
option (see git-clone(1)) by the specified number of
commits.</p>

<p>--dry-run Show what would be done, without making any
changes.</p>

<p>-f, --force When git fetch is used with
&lt;rbranch&gt;:&lt;lbranch&gt; refspec, it refuses to
update the local branch &lt;lbranch&gt; unless the remote
branch &lt;rbranch&gt; it fetches is a descendant of
&lt;lbranch&gt;. This option overrides that check.</p>

<p>-k, --keep Keep downloaded pack.</p>

<p>--multiple Allow several &lt;repository&gt; and
&lt;group&gt; arguments to be specified. No &lt;refspec&gt;s
may be specified.</p>

<p>--prune After fetching, remove any remote tracking
branches which no longer exist on the remote.</p>

<p>-n, --no-tags By default, tags that point at objects
that are downloaded from the remote repository are fetched
and stored locally. This option disables this automatic tag
following.</p>

<p>-t, --tags Most of the tags are fetched automatically as
branch heads are downloaded, but tags that do not point at
objects reachable from the branch heads that are being
tracked will not be fetched by this mechanism. This flag
lets all tags and their associated objects be
downloaded.</p>

<p>-u, --update-head-ok By default git fetch refuses to
update the head which corresponds to the current branch.
This flag disables the check. This is purely for the
internal use for git pull to communicate with git fetch, and
unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not
supposed to use it.</p>

<p>--upload-pack &lt;upload-pack&gt; When given, and the
repository to fetch from is handled by git fetch-pack,
--exec=&lt;upload-pack&gt; is passed to the command to
specify non-default path for the command run on the other
end.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence
any other internally used git commands. Progress is not
reported to the standard error stream.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be verbose.</p>

<p>--progress Progress status is reported on the standard
error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal,
unless -q is specified. This flag forces progress status
even if the standard error stream is not directed to a
terminal.</p>

<p>&lt;repository&gt; The &quot;remote&quot; repository
that is the source of a fetch or pull operation. This
parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS
below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES
below).</p>

<p>&lt;group&gt; A name referring to a list of repositories
as the value of remotes.&lt;group&gt; in the configuration
file. (See git-config(1)).</p>

<p>&lt;refspec&gt; The format of a &lt;refspec&gt;
parameter is an optional plus +, followed by the source ref
&lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon :, followed by the
destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.</p>

<p>The remote ref that matches &lt;src&gt; is fetched, and
if &lt;dst&gt; is not empty string, the local ref that
matches it is fast-forwarded using &lt;src&gt;. If the
optional plus + is used, the local ref is updated even if it
does not result in a fast-forward update.</p>

<p>Note If the remote branch from which you want to pull is
modified in non-linear ways such as being rewound and
rebased frequently, then a pull will attempt a merge with an
older version of itself, likely conflict, and fail. It is
under these conditions that you would want to use the + sign
to indicate non-fast-forward updates will be needed. There
is currently no easy way to determine or declare that a
branch will be made available in a repository with this
behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the
expected usage pattern for a branch.</p>

<p>Note You never do your own development on branches that
appear on the right hand side of a &lt;refspec&gt; colon on
Pull: lines; they are to be updated by git fetch. If you
intend to do development derived from a remote branch B,
have a Pull: line to track it (i.e. Pull: B:remote-B), and
have a separate branch my-B to do your development on top of
it. The latter is created by git branch my-B remote-B (or
its equivalent git checkout -b my-B remote-B). Run git fetch
to keep track of the progress of the remote side, and when
you see something new on the remote branch, merge it into
your development branch with git pull . remote-B, while you
are on my-B branch.</p>

<p>Note There is a difference between listing multiple
&lt;refspec&gt; directly on git pull command line and having
multiple Pull: &lt;refspec&gt; lines for a
&lt;repository&gt; and running git pull command without any
explicit &lt;refspec&gt; parameters. &lt;refspec&gt; listed
explicitly on the command line are always merged into the
current branch after fetching. In other words, if you list
more than one remote refs, you would be making an Octopus.
While git pull run without any explicit &lt;refspec&gt;
parameter takes default &lt;refspec&gt;s from Pull: lines,
it merges only the first &lt;refspec&gt; found into the
current branch, after fetching all the remote refs. This is
because making an Octopus from remote refs is rarely done,
while keeping track of multiple remote heads in one-go by
fetching more than one is often useful. Some short-cut
notations are also supported.</p>

<p>&middot; tag &lt;tag&gt; means the same as
refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;; it requests
fetching everything up to the given tag.</p>

<p>&middot; A parameter &lt;ref&gt; without a colon is
equivalent to &lt;ref&gt;: when pulling/fetching, so it
merges &lt;ref&gt; into the current branch without storing
the remote branch anywhere locally</p>

<p>GIT URLS In general, URLs contain information about the
transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and
the path to the repository. Depending on the transport
protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>

<p>Git natively supports ssh, git, http, https, ftp, ftps,
and rsync protocols. The following syntaxes may be used with
them:</p>

<p>&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the
ssh protocol:</p>

<p>&middot; [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username
expansion:</p>

<p>&middot;
ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot;
git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>For local respositories, also supported by git natively,
the following syntaxes may be used:</p>

<p>&middot; /path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>&middot; file:///path/to/repo.git/</p>

<p>These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when
cloning, when the former implies --local option. See
git-clone(1) for details.</p>

<p>When git doesnt know how to handle a certain transport
protocol, it attempts to use the remote-&lt;transport&gt;
remote helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote
helper, the following syntax may be used:</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path,
or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific
remote helper being invoked. See git-remote-helpers(1) for
details.</p>

<p>If there are a large number of similarly-named remote
repositories and you want to use a different format for them
(such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that
work), you can create a configuration section of the
form:</p>

<p>[url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] insteadOf =
&lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p>For example, with this:</p>

<p>[url &quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;] insteadOf =
host.xz:/path/to/ insteadOf = work:</p>

<p>a URL like &quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
&quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in
any context that takes a URL to be
&quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can
create a configuration section of the form:</p>

<p>[url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;] pushInsteadOf
= &lt;other url base&gt;</p>

<p>For example, with this:</p>

<p>[url &quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;] pushInsteadOf =
git://example.org/</p>

<p>a URL like
&quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot;
for pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<p>REMOTES The name of one of the following can be used
instead of a URL as &lt;repository&gt; argument:</p>

<p>&middot; a remote in the git configuration file:
$GIT_DIR/config,</p>

<p>&middot; a file in the $GIT_DIR/remotes directory,
or</p>

<p>&middot; a file in the $GIT_DIR/branches directory.</p>

<p>All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the
command line because they each contain a refspec which git
will use by default.</p>

<p>Named remote in configuration file You can choose to
provide the name of a remote which you had previously
configured using git-remote(1), git-config(1) or even by a
manual edit to the $GIT_DIR/config file. The URL of this
remote will be used to access the repository. The refspec of
this remote will be used by default when you do not provide
a refspec on the command line. The entry in the config file
would appear like this:</p>

<p>[remote &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;] url = &lt;url&gt;
pushurl = &lt;pushurl&gt; push = &lt;refspec&gt; fetch =
&lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;pushurl&gt; is used for pushes only. It is
optional and defaults to &lt;url&gt;.</p>

<p>Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes You can choose to provide
the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/remotes. The URL in this file
will be used to access the repository. The refspec in this
file will be used as default when you do not provide a
refspec on the command line. This file should have the
following format:</p>

<p>URL: one of the above URL format Push: &lt;refspec&gt;
Pull: &lt;refspec&gt;</p>

<p>Push: lines are used by git push and Pull: lines are
used by git pull and git fetch. Multiple Push: and Pull:
lines may be specified for additional branch mappings.</p>

<p>Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches You can choose to
provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/branches. The URL in
this file will be used to access the repository. This file
should have the following format:</p>

<p>&lt;url&gt;#&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;url&gt; is required; #&lt;head&gt; is optional.</p>

<p>Depending on the operation, git will use one of the
following refspecs, if you dont provide one on the command
line. &lt;branch&gt; is the name of this file in
$GIT_DIR/branches and &lt;head&gt; defaults to master.</p>

<p>git fetch uses:</p>

<p>refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;:refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p>git push uses:</p>

<p>HEAD:refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;</p>

<p>EXAMPLES &middot; Update the remote-tracking
branches:</p>

<p>$ git fetch origin</p>

<p>The above command copies all branches from the remote
refs/heads/ namespace and stores them to the local
refs/remotes/origin/ namespace, unless the
branch.&lt;name&gt;.fetch option is used to specify a
non-default refspec.</p>

<p>&middot; Using refspecs explicitly:</p>

<p>$ git fetch origin +pu:pu maint:tmp</p>

<p>This updates (or creates, as necessary) branches pu and
tmp in the local repository by fetching from the branches
(respectively) pu and maint from the remote repository.</p>

<p>The pu branch will be updated even if it is does not
fast-forward, because it is prefixed with a plus sign; tmp
will not be.</p>
