<p>NAME curl_easy_pause - pause and unpause a
connection</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLcode curl_easy_pause(CURL *handle, int bitmask
);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Using this function, you can explicitly mark
a running connection to get paused, and you can unpause a
connection that was previously paused.</p>

<p>A connection can be paused by using this function or by
letting the read or the write callbacks return the proper
magic return code (CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE and
CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE). A write callback that returns pause
signals to the library that it couldnt take care of any data
at all, and that data will then be delivered again to the
callback when the writing is later unpaused.</p>

<p>NOTE: while it may feel tempting, take care and notice
that you cannot call this function from another thread.</p>

<p>When this function is called to unpause reading, the
chance is high that you will get your write callback called
before this function returns.</p>

<p>The handle argument is of course identifying the handle
that operates on the connection you want to pause or
unpause.</p>

<p>The bitmask argument is a set of bits that sets the new
state of the connection. The following bits can be used:</p>

<p>CURLPAUSE_RECV Pause receiving data. There will be no
data received on this connection until this function is
called again without this bit set. Thus, the write callback
(CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION) wont be called.</p>

<p>CURLPAUSE_SEND Pause sending data. There will be no data
sent on this connec- tion until this function is called
again without this bit set. Thus, the read callback
(CURLOPT_READFUNCTION) wont be called.</p>

<p>CURLPAUSE_ALL Convenience define that pauses both
directions.</p>

<p>CURLPAUSE_CONT Convenience define that unpauses both
directions</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE CURLE_OK (zero) means that the option was
set properly, and a non-zero return code means something
wrong occurred after the new state was set. See the
libcurl-errors(3) man page for the full list with
descriptions.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY This function was added in libcurl 7.18.0.
Before this version, there was no explicit support for
pausing transfers.</p>

<p>MEMORY USE When pausing a read by returning the magic
return code from a write callback, the read data is already
in libcurls internal buffers so itll have to keep it in an
allocated buffer until the reading is again unpaused using
this function.</p>

<p>If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get
uncompressed automatically on download, libcurl will
continue to uncompress the entire downloaded chunk and it
will cache the data uncompressed. This has the side- effect
that if you download something that is compressed a lot, it
can result in a very large data amount needing to be allo-
cated to save the data during the pause. This said, you
should probably consider not using paused reading if you
allow libcurl to uncompress data automatically.</p>
