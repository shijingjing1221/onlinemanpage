<p>PERLUTS(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLUTS(1)</p>

<p>NAME perluts - Perl under UTS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS This document can be read as is: as README.uts,
or you can read it after you build your package using
&quot;man perluts&quot;.</p>

<p>The purpose is to help you build Perl for UTS, which, if
you follow these instructions, should be easy, and result in
a solidly working installation.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Perl 5.7.2 (Developmental) or Perl 5.8.x
(forthcoming) for UTS</p>

<p>BUILDING PERL ON UTS NOTE: Some sites have redefined the
way uname works, and if yours does this, special steps must
be taken so that Configure can recognize your system as a
UTS system. To see if you are in this category, issue the
command &quot;uname -a&quot;. It should look something
like:</p>

<p>uts juno 4 4.4 9672 370</p>

<p>At any rate, the first field should be &quot;uts&quot;.
If this is not the case; supposing it is, say telcoUTS,
create a script, uts/uname (i.e. uname, in the subdirectory
&quot;uts&quot; of the main Perl source dir): # uname
/usr/bin/uname &quot;$@&quot; | sed -e s/^telcoUTS/uts/</p>

<p>and when you execute Configure, do it as below, except
for adding PATH=uts:$PATH as a prefix. I.e. do:</p>

<p>PATH=uts:$PATH ./Configure ...</p>

<p>There is no need to do an interactive configure, just
type</p>

<p>./Configure -de [-Dusedevel] [-Doptimize=-g ]
2&gt;&amp;1 | tee Conf.out</p>

<p>&quot;-Dusedevel&quot; may be required to configure Perl
5.7.2 non-interactively. Use -Doptimize=-g if you want to
run Perl under sdb or gdb, OR if you want to be able to use
the -D command line flags to perl, which are occasionally
useful in debugging perl scripts.</p>

<p>In this and the following steps, the &quot;2&gt;&amp;1 |
tee XXX.out&quot; records all output from the process, which
will be useful if anything unexpected goes wrong.</p>

<p>Then do the compilation with</p>

<p>make 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee make.out</p>

<p>Finally, test using</p>

<p>make test 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee make-test.out</p>

<p>In the output, the only failures you should see should
look like:</p>

<p>lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigfltpm.........Use of uninitialized
value ... FAILED at test 57
lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintc..........ok
lib/Math/BigInt/t/bigintpm.........FAILED at test 204
lib/Math/BigInt/t/mbimbf...........Use of uninitialized
value ... Illegal division by zero at
../lib/Math/BigInt/Calc.pm line 314. FAILED at test 71
lib/Math/Complex...................exp: OVERFLOW FAILED at
test 250 lib/Math/Trig......................exp: OVERFLOW ok
lib/Memoize/t/array................ok ...
lib/Net/protoent...................ok
lib/Net/servent....................FAILED at test 0</p>

<p>This means that everything passes except for some
problems in the packages &quot;Math::BigInt&quot;,
&quot;Math::Complex&quot;, and &quot;Math::Trig&quot;. The
lib/Net/servent failure seems to be a bug in the test
program. To confirm this, from the main Perl source dir,
do:</p>

<p>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lsquo;pwd&lsquo; ./perl -Ilib
lib/Net/servent.t</p>

<p>and it should output</p>

<p>1..3 ok 1 ok 2 ok 3</p>

<p>Installing the built perl on UTS Run the command
&quot;make install&quot;</p>
