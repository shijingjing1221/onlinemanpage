<p>IPSEC_RANBITS(8) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_RANBITS(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_ranbits - generate random bits in ASCII
form</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec ranbits [--quick] [--continuous]
[--bytes] nbits</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ranbits obtains nbits (rounded up to the
nearest byte) high-quality random bits from random(4), and
emits them on standard output as an ASCII string. The
default output format is datatot(3) h format: lowercase
hexadecimal with a 0x prefix and an underscore every 32
bits.</p>

<p>The --quick option produces quick-and-dirty random bits:
instead of using the high-quality random bits from
/dev/random, which may take some time to supply the
necessary bits if nbits is large, ranbits uses /dev/urandom,
which yields prompt results but lower-quality
randomness.</p>

<p>The --continuous option uses datatot(3) x output format,
like h but without the underscores.</p>

<p>The --bytes option causes nbits to be interpreted as a
byte count rather than a bit count.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/random, /dev/urandom</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ipsec_datatot(3), random(4)</p>

<p>HISTORY Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.</p>

<p>BUGS There is an internal limit on nbits, currently
20000.</p>

<p>Without --quick, ranbits&acute;s run time is difficult
to predict. A request for a large number of bits, at a time
when the system&acute;s entropy pool is low on randomness,
may take quite a while to satisfy.</p>

<p>Though not a bug of ranbits, the direct use of
/dev/hw_random, the Linux hardware random number generator
is not supported because it can produce very non-random
data. To properly use /dev/hw_random, the rngd daemon should
be used to read from /dev/hw_random and write to
/dev/random, while performing a FIPS test on the hardware
random read. No changes to Openswan are required for this
support - just a running rngd.</p>
