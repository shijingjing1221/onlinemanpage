<p>FIXPARTS(8) FixParts Manual FIXPARTS(8)</p>

<p>NAME fixparts - MBR partition table repair utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fixparts device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FixParts (aka fixparts) is a text-mode
menu-driven program for repair- ing certain types of
problems with Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables. The
program has three design goals, although a few additional
features are supported, as well:</p>

<p>* It can remove stray GUID Partition Table (GPT) data,
which can be left behind on a disk that was once used as a
GPT disk but then incompletely converted to the more common
(as of 2011) MBR form.</p>

<p>* It can repair mis-sized extended partitions -- either
partitions that extend beyond the physical end of the disk
or that overlap with nearby primary partitions. FixParts is
designed in such a way that this type of repair occurs
automatically, so if its the only problem with your disk,
you can launch the program and then immediately save the
partition table, making no manual changes, and the program
will fix the problem.</p>

<p>* You can change primary partitions into logical
partitions or vice-versa, within constraints imposed by the
MBR data struc- tures.</p>

<p>Additional features include the ability to change
partition type codes or boot/active flags, to delete
partitions, and to recompute CHS val- ues. With the possible
exception of recomputing CHS values, these sec- ondary
features are better performed with fdisk, because fixparts
design means that it s likely to alter partition numbering
even when such changes are not requested.</p>

<p>The fixparts program employs a user interface similar to
that of Linuxs fdisk, but fixparts is much more specialized.
Most importantly, you cant create new partitions with
fixparts, although you can change primary/logical
assignment.</p>

<p>In the MBR scheme, partitions come in three
varieties:</p>

<p>primary These partitions are defined in the first sector
of the hard disk and are limited in number to four. Some
OSes, such as Win- dows and FreeBSD, must boot from a
primary partition.</p>

<p>extended Extended partitions are specialized primary
partitions. They serve as holding areas for logical
partitions.</p>

<p>logical A disk can contain an arbitrary number of
logical partitions (fixparts, however, imposes a limit of
124 logical partitions). All the logical partitions reside
inside a single extended par- tition, and are defined using
a linked-list data structure. This fact means that every
logical partition must be preceded by at least one sector of
unallocated space to hold its defining data structure (an
Extended Boot Record, or EBR).</p>

<p>These distinctions mean that primary and logical
partitions cannot be arbitrarily interspersed. A disk can
contain one to three primary par- titions, a block of one or
more logical partitions, and one to three more primary
partitions (for a total of three primary partitions, not
counting the extended partition). Primary partitions may not
be sand- wiched between logical partitions, since this would
mean placing a pri- mary partition within an extended
partition (which is just a specific type of primary
partition).</p>

<p>Unlike most disk utilities, fixparts user interface
ignores extended partitions. Internally, the program
discards the information on the original extended partition
and, when you tell it to save its changes, it generates a
new extended partition to contain the then-defined logi- cal
partitions. This is done because most of the repairs and
manipula- tions the tool performs require generating a fresh
extended partition, so keeping the original in the user
interface would only be a complica- tion.</p>

<p>Another unusual feature of fixparts user interface is
that partition numbers do not necessarily correlate with
primary/logical status. In most utilities, partitions 1-4
correspond to primary partitions, whereas partitions 5 and
up are logical partitions. In fixparts, any partition number
may be assigned primary or logical status, so long as the
rules for layout described earlier are obeyed. When the
partition table is saved, partitions will be assigned
appropriately and then tools such as the Linux kernel and
fdisk will give them conventional numbers.</p>

<p>When it first starts, fixparts performs a scan for GPT
data. If the disk looks like a conventional GPT disk,
fixparts refuses to run. If the disk appears to be a
conventional MBR disk but GPT signatures are present in the
GPT primary or secondary header areas, fixparts offers to
delete this extraneous data. If you tell it to do so, the
program immediately wipes the GPT header or headers. (If
only one header was found, only that one header will be
erased, to minimize the risk of damaging a boot loader or
other data that might have overwritten just one of the GPT
headers.)</p>

<p>With the exception of optionally erasing leftover GPT
data when it first starts, fixparts keeps all changes in
memory until the user writes changes with the w command.
Thus, you can adjust your partitions in the user interface
and abort those changes by typing q to quit with- out saving
changes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The fixparts utility supports no command-line
options, except for spec- ification of the target
device.</p>

<p>Most interactions with fixparts occur with its
interactive text-mode menu. Specific functions are:</p>

<p>a Toggle the active/boot flag. This flag is required by
some boot loaders and OSes.</p>

<p>c Recompute the cylinder/head/sector (CHS) values for
all parti- tions. CHS addressing mode is largely obsolete,
but some OSes and utilities complain if they dont like the
CHS values. Note that fixparts CHS values are likely to be
incorrect on disks smaller than about 8 GiB except on
Linux.</p>

<p>l Change a partition s status to logical. This option
will only work if the current partition layout supports such
a change. Note that if changing a partitions status in this
way is not currently possible, making some other change may
make it possi- ble. For instance, omitting a partition that
precedes the target partition may enable converting a
partition to logical form if there had been no free sectors
between the two partitions.</p>

<p>o Omit a partition. Once omitted, the partition will
still appear in the fixparts partition list, but it will be
flagged as omit- ted. You can subsequently convert it to
primary or logical form with the r or l commands,
respectively. When you save your changes with w, though, the
partition will be lost.</p>

<p>p Display basic partition summary data. This includes
partitions number, the boot/active flags status, starting
and ending sec- tor numbers, primary/logical/omitted status,
whether or not the partition may be converted to logical
form, and the partitions MBR types code.</p>

<p>q Quit from the program without saving your changes. Use
this option if you just wanted to view information or if you
make a mistake and want to back out of all your changes.</p>

<p>r Change a partition s status to primary. This option
will only work if the current partition layout supports such
a change. Note that every partition can theoretically become
a primary partition, although in some configurations, making
this change will require omitting some partitions. If
fixparts refuses to allow changing a partition to primary,
you may need to convert other partitions to logical form or
omit them entirely.</p>

<p>s Sort partition entries. This option orders partitions
in the display to match their on-disk positions, which can
make under- standing the disk layout easier in some cases.
This option has no effect on the ultimate ordering of
logical partitions, which are sorted before being saved. The
order of primary partitions in the final saved partition
table may be affected by this option. In both cases, as
already noted, the partition numbers displayed by fixparts
may not be the same as those used by the kernel or displayed
by other partitioning tools.</p>

<p>t Change a partitions type code. You enter the type code
using a one-byte hexadecimal number.</p>

<p>w Write data. Use this command to save your changes and
exit from the program.</p>

<p>? Print the menu. Type this command (or any other
unrecognized command) to see a summary of available
options.</p>

<p>BUGS As of March 2014 (version 0.8.10), fixparts should
be considered beta software. Known bugs and limitations
include:</p>

<p>* The program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD,
Mac OS X, and Windows. Linux versions for x86-64 (64-bit),
x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have been tested, with
the x86-64 version having seen the most testing. Under
FreeBSD, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions have been
tested. Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X and Windows have
been tested.</p>

<p>* The FreeBSD version of the program cant write changes
to the partition table to a disk when existing partitions on
that disk are mounted. (The same problem exists with many
other FreeBSD utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.) This
limitation can be overcome by typing sysctl
kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell prompt.</p>

<p>* The program can load only up to 128 partitions (4
primary parti- tions and 124 logical partitions). This limit
can be raised by changing the #define MAX_MBR_PARTS line in
the basicmbr.h source code file and recompiling.</p>

<p>* The program can read partitions only if the disk has
correct LBA partition descriptors. These descriptors should
be present on any disk over 8 GiB in size or on smaller
disks partitioned with any but very ancient software.</p>

<p>* The program makes no effort to preserve partition
numbers. This can have consequences for boot loaders and for
mounting filesys- tems via /etc/fstab. It may be necessary
to edit configuration files or even to re-install your boot
loader.</p>

<p>* The program may change the order of partitions in the
partition table.</p>
