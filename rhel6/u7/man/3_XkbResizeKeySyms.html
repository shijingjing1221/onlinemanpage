<p>XkbResizeKeySyms(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbResizeKeySyms(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbResizeKeySyms - Change the number of symbols
bound to a key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS KeySym * XkbResizeKeySyms (XkbDescRec *xkb, int
key, int needed);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - xkb keyboard description to be changed</p>

<p>- key keycode for key to modify</p>

<p>- needed new number of keysyms required for key</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbResizeKeySyms reserves the space needed
for needed keysyms and returns a pointer to the beginning of
the new array that holds the keysyms. It adjusts the offset
field of the key_sym_map entry for the key if necessary and
can also change the syms, num_syms, and size_syms fields of
xkb-&gt;map if it is necessary to reallocate the syms array.
XkbResizeKeySyms does not modify either the width or number
of groups associated with the key.</p>

<p>If needed is greater than the current number of keysyms
for the key, XkbResizeKeySyms initializes all new keysyms in
the array to NoSymbol.</p>

<p>Because the number of symbols needed by a key is
normally computed as width * number of groups, and
XkbResizeKeySyms does not modify either the width or number
of groups for the key, a discrepancy exists upon return from
XkbResizeKeySyms between the space allocated for the keysyms
and the number required. The unused entries in the list of
sym- bols returned by XkbResizeKeySyms are not preserved
across future calls to any of the map editing functions, so
you must update the key symbol mapping (which updates the
width and number of groups for the key) before calling
another allocator function. A call to XkbChangeType- sOfKey
will update the mapping.</p>

<p>If any allocation errors occur while resizing the number
of symbols bound to the key, XkbResizeKeySyms returns
NULL.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO XkbChangeTypesOfKey(3),
XkbResizeKeyActions(3)</p>

<p>NOTES A change to the number of symbols bound to a key
should be accompanied by a change in the number of actions
bound to a key. Refer to XkbRe- sizeKeyActions for more
information on changing the number of actions bound to a
key.</p>
