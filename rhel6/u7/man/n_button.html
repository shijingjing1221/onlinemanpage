options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-command
Database Name: command Database Class: Command</p>

<p>Specifies a Tcl command to associate with the button.
This com- mand is typically invoked when mouse button 1 is
released over the button window.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-default Database Name: default
Database Class: Default</p>

<p>Specifies one of three states for the default ring:
normal, active, or disabled. In active state, the button is
drawn with the platform specific appearance for a default
button. In nor- mal state, the button is drawn with the
platform specific appearance for a non-default button,
leaving enough space to draw the default button appearance.
The normal and active states will result in buttons of the
same size. In disabled state, the button is drawn with the
non-default button appear- ance without leaving space for
the default appearance. The dis- abled state may result in a
smaller button than the active state.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-height Database Name: height Database
Class: Height</p>

<p>Specifies a desired height for the button. If an image
or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is
in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels); for text it is in lines of text. If this
option is not speci- fied, the buttons desired height is
computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text being
displayed in it.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-overrelief Database Name: overRelief
Database Class: OverRelief</p>

<p>Specifies an alternative relief for the button, to be
used when the mouse cursor is over the widget. This option
can be used to make toolbar buttons, by configuring -relief
flat -overrelief raised. If the value of this option is the
empty string, then no alternative relief is used when the
mouse cursor is over the button. The empty string is the
default value.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-state Database Name: state Database
Class: State</p>

<p>Specifies one of three states for the button: normal,
active, or disabled. In normal state the button is displayed
using the foreground and background options. The active
state is typi- cally used when the pointer is over the
button. In active state the button is displayed using the
activeForeground and active- Background options. Disabled
state means that the button should be insensitive: the
default bindings will refuse to activate the widget and will
ignore mouse button presses. In this state the
disabledForeground and background options determine how the
button is displayed.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image or
bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is in
screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
Tk_GetPixels). For a text button (no image or with -compound
none) then the width specifies how much space in characters
to allocate for the text label. If the width is negative
then this specifies a minimum width. If this option is not
specified, the buttons desired width is computed from the
size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.

<p>DESCRIPTION The button command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argu- ment) and makes it into a
button widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the button such as its colors, font,
text, and initial relief. The button command returns its
pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named pathName, but pathNames
parent must exist.</p>

<p>A button is a widget that displays a textual string,
bitmap or image. If text is displayed, it must all be in a
single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the screen
(if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of
the wrapLength option) and one of the char- acters may
optionally be underlined using the underline option. It can
display itself in either of three different ways, according
to the state option; it can be made to appear raised,
sunken, or flat; and it can be made to flash. When a user
invokes the button (by pressing mouse button 1 with the
cursor over the button), then the Tcl command specified in
the -command option is invoked.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The button command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
The following commands are possible for button widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the button command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the button command.</p>

<p>pathName flash Flash the button. This is accomplished by
redisplaying the but- ton several times, alternating between
active and normal colors. At the end of the flash the button
is left in the same nor- mal/active state as when the
command was invoked. This command is ignored if the buttons
state is disabled.</p>

<p>pathName invoke Invoke the Tcl command associated with
the button, if there is one. The return value is the return
value from the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is
no command associated with the button. This command is
ignored if the button s state is dis- abled.</p>

<p>DEFAULT BINDINGS Tk automatically creates class bindings
for buttons that give them default behavior:</p>

<p>[1] A button activates whenever the mouse passes over it
and deacti- vates whenever the mouse leaves the button.
Under Windows, this binding is only active when mouse button
1 has been pressed over the button.</p>

<p>[2] A button s relief is changed to sunken whenever
mouse button 1 is pressed over the button, and the relief is
restored to its original value when button 1 is later
released.</p>

<p>[3] If mouse button 1 is pressed over a button and later
released over the button, the button is invoked. However, if
the mouse is not over the button when button 1 is released,
then no invo- cation occurs.</p>

<p>[4] When a button has the input focus, the space key
causes the but- ton to be invoked.</p>

<p>If the button s state is disabled then none of the above
actions occur: the button is completely non-responsive.</p>

<p>The behavior of buttons can be changed by defining new
bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the class
bindings.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This is the classic Tk Hello, World!
demonstration:</p>

<p>button .b -text &quot;Hello, World!&quot; -command exit
pack .b</p>

<p>This example demonstrates how to handle button
accelerators:</p>

<p>button .b1 -text Hello -underline 0 button .b2 -text
World -underline 0 bind . &lt;Key-h&gt; {.b1 flash; .b1
invoke} bind . &lt;Key-w&gt; {.b2 flash; .b2 invoke} pack
.b1 .b2</p>
