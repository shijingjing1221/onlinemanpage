<p>POSIX_TRACE_EVENT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_TRACE_EVENT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_event, posix_trace_eventid_open - trace
functions for instrumenting application code (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>void posix_trace_event(trace_event_id_t event_id, const
void *restrictdata_ptr, size_t data_len); int
posix_trace_eventid_open(const char *restrict event_name,
trace_event_id_t *restrict event_id);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_event() function shall
record the event_id and the user data pointed to by data_ptr
in the trace stream into which the calling process is being
traced and in which event_id is not filtered out. If the
total size of the user trace event data represented by
data_len is not greater than the declared maximum size for
user trace event data, then the truncation-status attribute
of the trace event recorded is POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED.
Otherwise, the user trace event data is truncated to this
declared maximum size and the truncation-status attribute of
the trace event recorded is
POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD.</p>

<p>If there is no trace stream created for the process or
if the created trace stream is not running, or if the trace
event specified by event_id is filtered out in the trace
stream, the posix_trace_event() function shall have no
effect.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventid_open() function shall associate
a user trace event name with a trace event type identifier
for the calling process. The trace event name is the string
pointed to by the argument event_name. It shall have a
maximum of {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} charac- ters (which has
the minimum value {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}). The number
of user trace event type identifiers that can be defined for
any given process is limited by the maximum value
{TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which has the minimum value
{POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.</p>

<p>If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the
posix_trace_even- tid_open() function shall associate the
user trace event name pointed to by the event_name argument
with a trace event type identifier that is unique for the
traced process, and is returned in the variable pointed to
by the event_id argument. If the user trace event name has
already been mapped for the traced process, then the
previously assigned trace event type identifier shall be
returned. If the per-pro- cess user trace event name limit
represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the
pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see Trace Option:
User Trace Event ) user trace event shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the
posix_trace_even- tid_open() function shall associate the
user trace event name pointed to by the event_name argument
with a trace event type identifier that is unique for all
the processes being traced in this same trace stream, and is
returned in the variable pointed to by the event_id
argument. If the user trace event name has already been
mapped for the traced processes, then the previously
assigned trace event type identifier shall be returned. If
the per-process user trace event name limit rep- resented by
{TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-defined
POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT ( Trace Option: User Trace
Event ) user trace event shall be returned.</p>

<p>Note: The above procedure, together with the fact that
multiple pro- cesses can only be traced into the same trace
stream by inheri- tance, ensure that all the processes that
are traced into a trace stream have the same mapping of
trace event names to trace event type identifiers.</p>

<p>If there is no trace stream created, the
posix_trace_eventid_open() function shall store this
information for future trace streams created for this
process.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE No return value is defined for the
posix_trace_event() function.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, the
posix_trace_eventid_open() function shall return a value of
zero. Otherwise, it shall return the corre- sponding error
number. The posix_trace_eventid_open() function stores the
trace event type identifier value in the object pointed to
by event_id, if successful.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_trace_eventid_open() function shall
fail if:</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The size of the name pointed to by the
event_name argument was longer than the
implementation-defined value {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}.</p>
