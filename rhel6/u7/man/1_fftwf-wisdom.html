<p>NAME fftwf-wisdom - create wisdom (pre-optimized
FFTs)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fftwf-wisdom [OPTION]... [SIZE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fftwf-wisdom is a utility to generate FFTW
wisdom files, which contain saved information about how to
optimally compute (Fourier) transforms of various sizes.
FFTW is a free library to compute discrete Fourier
transforms in one or more dimensions, for arbitrary sizes,
and of both real and complex data, among other related
operations. More informa- tion on FFTW can be found at the
FFTW home page: http://www.fftw.org</p>

<p>Programs using FFTW can be written to load wisdom from
an arbitrary file, string, or other source. Moreover, it is
likely that many FFTW- using programs will load the system
wisdom file, which is stored in /etc/fftw/wisdomf by
default. fftwf-wisdom can be used to create or add to such
wisdom files. In its most typical usage, the wisdom file can
be created to pre-plan a canonical set of sizes (see below)
via:</p>

<p>fftwf-wisdom -v -c -o wisdomf</p>

<p>(this will take many hours, which can be limited by the
-t option) and the output wisdomf file can then be copied
(as root) to /etc/fftw/ or whatever.</p>

<p>The fftwf-wisdom program normally writes the wisdom
directly to stan- dard output, but this can be changed via
the -o option, as in the exam- ple above.</p>

<p>If the system wisdom file /etc/fftw/wisdomf already
exists, then fftwf- wisdom reads this existing wisdom
(unless the -n option is specified) and outputs both the old
wisdom and any newly created wisdom. In this way, it can be
used to add new transform sizes to the existing system
wisdom (or other wisdom file, with the -w option).</p>

<p>SPECIFYING SIZES Although a canonical set of sizes to
optimize is specified by the -c option, the user can also
specify zero or more non-canonical transform sizes and types
to optimize, via the SIZE arguments following the option
flags. Alternatively, the sizes to optimize can be read from
standard input (whitespace-separated), if a SIZE argument of
&quot;-&quot; is supplied.</p>

<p>Sizes are specified by the syntax:</p>


<p>&lt;type&gt;&lt;inplace&gt;&lt;direction&gt;&lt;geometry&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;type&gt; is either &acute;c&acute; (complex),
&acute;r&acute; (real, r2c/c2r), or &acute;k&acute; (r2r,
per- dimension kinds, specified in the geometry, below).</p>

<p>&lt;inplace&gt; is either &acute;i&acute; (in place) or
&acute;o&acute; (out of place).</p>

<p>&lt;direction&gt; is either &acute;f&acute; (forward) or
&acute;b&acute; (backward). The &lt;direction&gt; should be
omitted for &acute;k&acute; transforms, where it is
specified via the geometry instead.</p>

<p>&lt;geometry&gt; is the size and dimensionality of the
transform, where dif- ferent dimensions are separated by
&acute;x&acute; (e.g. &acute;16x32&acute; for a two-dimen-
sional 16 by 32 transform). In the case of &acute;k&acute;
transforms, the size of each dimension is followed by a
&quot;type&quot; string, which can be one of
f/b/h/e00/e01/e10/e11/o00/o01/o10/o11 for
R2HC/HC2R/DHT/REDFT00/.../RODFT11, respectively, as defined
in the FFTW manual.</p>

<p>For example, &acute;cif12x13x14&acute; is a
three-dimensional 12 by 13 x 14 complex DFT operating
in-place. &acute;rob65536&acute; is a one-dimensional
size-65536 out-of-place complex-to-real (backwards)
transform operating on Hermi- tian-symmetry input.
&acute;ki10hx20e01&acute; is a two-dimensional 10 by 20 r2r
transform where the first dimension is a DHT and the second
dimension is an REDFT01 (DCT-III).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Display help on the command-line
options and usage.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the version number and copyright
information.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Verbose output. (You can specify this
multiple times, or supply a numeric argument greater than 1,
to increase the verbosity level.) Note that the verbose
output will be mixed with the wisdom output (making it
impossible to import), unless you write the wisdom to a file
via the -o option.</p>

<p>-c, --canonical Optimize/pre-plan a canonical set of
sizes: all powers of two and ten up to 2^20 (1048576),
including both real and complex, forward and backwards,
in-place and out-of-place transforms. Also includes two- and
three-dimensional transforms of equal- size dimensions (e.g.
16x16x16).</p>

<p>-t hours, --time-limit=hours Stop after a time of hours
(hours) has elapsed, outputting accu- mulated wisdom. (The
problems are planned in increasing order of size.) Defaults
to 0, indicating no time limit.</p>

<p>-o file, --output-file=file Send wisdom output to file
rather than to standard output (the default).</p>

<p>-m, --measure; -e, --estimate; -x, --exhaustive
Normally, fftwf-wisdom creates plans in FFTW_PATIENT mode,
but with these options you can instead use FFTW_MEASURE,
FFTW_ESTI- MATE, or FFTW_EXHAUSTIVE modes, respectively, as
described in more detail by the FFTW manual.</p>

<p>Note that wisdom is tagged with the planning patience
level, and a single file can mix different levels of wisdom
(e.g. you can mostly use the patient default, but plan a few
sizes that you especially care about in --exhaustive
mode).</p>

<p>-n, --no-system-wisdom Do not import the system wisdom
from /etc/fftw/wisdomf (which is normally read by
default).</p>

<p>-w file, --wisdom-file=file Import wisdom from file (in
addition to the system wisdom, unless -n is specified).
Multiple wisdom files can be read via multiple -w options.
If file is &quot;-&quot;, then read wisdom from standard
input.</p>
