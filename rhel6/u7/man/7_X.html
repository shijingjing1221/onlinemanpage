<p>NAME X - a portable, network-transparent window
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The X Window System is a network transparent
window system which runs on a wide range of computing and
graphics machines. It should be rela- tively straightforward
to build the X.Org Foundation software distribu- tion on
most ANSI C and POSIX compliant systems. Commercial
implemen- tations are also available for a wide range of
platforms.</p>

<p>The X.Org Foundation requests that the following names
be used when referring to this software:</p>

<p>X X Window System X Version 11 X Window System, Version
11 X11</p>

<p>X Window System is a trademark of The Open Group.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION X Window System servers run on computers
with bitmap displays. The server distributes user input to
and accepts output requests from vari- ous client programs
through a variety of different interprocess commu- nication
channels. Although the most common case is for the client
programs to be running on the same machine as the server,
clients can be run transparently from other machines
(including machines with dif- ferent architectures and
operating systems) as well.</p>

<p>X supports overlapping hierarchical subwindows and text
and graphics operations, on both monochrome and color
displays. For a full explana- tion of the functions that are
available, see the Xlib - C Language X Interface manual, the
X Window System Protocol specification, the X Toolkit
Intrinsics - C Language Interface manual, and various
toolkit documents.</p>

<p>Many other utilities, window managers, games, toolkits,
etc. are included as user-contributed software in the X.Org
Foundation distribu- tion, or are available on the Internet.
See your site administrator for details.</p>

<p>STARTING UP There are two main ways of getting the X
server and an initial set of client applications started.
The particular method used depends on what operating system
you are running and whether or not you use other window
systems in addition to X.</p>

<p>xdm (the X Display Manager) If you want to always have X
running on your display, your site administrator can set
your machine up to use the X Display Man- ager xdm. This
program is typically started by the system at boot time and
takes care of keeping the server running and get- ting users
logged in. If you are running xdm, you will see a window on
the screen welcoming you to the system and asking for your
username and password. Simply type them in as you would at a
normal terminal, pressing the Return key after each. If you
make a mistake, xdm will display an error message and ask
you to try again. After you have successfully logged in, xdm
will start up your X environment. By default, if you have an
executable file named .xsession in your home directory, xdm
will treat it as a program (or shell script) to run to start
up your initial clients (such as terminal emulators, clocks,
a window manager, user settings for things like the
background, the speed of the pointer, etc.). Your site
administrator can provide details.</p>

<p>xinit (run manually from the shell) Sites that support
more than one window system might choose to use the xinit
program for starting X manually. If this is true for your
machine, your site administrator will probably have provided
a program named &quot;x11&quot;, &quot;startx&quot;, or
&quot;xstart&quot; that will do site-specific initialization
(such as loading convenient default resources, running a
window manager, displaying a clock, and starting several
terminal emulators) in a nice way. If not, you can build
such a script using the xinit program. This utility simply
runs one user-specified program to start the server, runs
another to start up any desired clients, and then waits for
either to finish. Since either or both of the user-specified
programs may be a shell script, this gives sub- stantial
flexibility at the expense of a nice interface. For this
reason, xinit is not intended for end users.</p>

<p>DISPLAY NAMES From the users perspective, every X server
has a display name of the form:</p>

<p>hostname:displaynumber.screennumber</p>

<p>This information is used by the application to determine
how it should connect to the server and which screen it
should use by default (on displays with multiple
monitors):</p>

<p>hostname The hostname specifies the name of the machine
to which the display is physically connected. If the
hostname is not given, the most efficient way of
communicating to a server on the same machine will be
used.</p>

<p>displaynumber The phrase &quot;display&quot; is usually
used to refer to collection of monitors that share a common
keyboard and pointer (mouse, tablet, etc.). Most
workstations tend to only have one key- board, and
therefore, only one display. Larger, multi-user systems,
however, frequently have several displays so that more than
one person can be doing graphics work at once. To avoid
confusion, each display on a machine is assigned a display
num- ber (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display
is started. The display number must always be given in a
display name.</p>

<p>screennumber Some displays share a single keyboard and
pointer among two or more monitors. Since each monitor has
its own set of windows, each screen is assigned a screen
number (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display
is started. If the screen number is not given, screen 0 will
be used.</p>

<p>On POSIX systems, the default display name is stored in
your DISPLAY environment variable. This variable is set
automatically by the xterm terminal emulator. However, when
you log into another machine on a network, you will need to
set DISPLAY by hand to point to your display. For
example,</p>

<p>% setenv DISPLAY myws:0 $ DISPLAY=myws:0; export DISPLAY
The xon script can be used to start an X program on a remote
machine; it automatically sets the DISPLAY variable
correctly.</p>

<p>Finally, most X programs accept a command line option of
-display dis- playname to temporarily override the contents
of DISPLAY. This is most commonly used to pop windows on
another persons screen or as part of a &quot;remote
shell&quot; command to start an xterm pointing back to your
display. For example,</p>

<p>% xeyes -display joesws:0 -geometry 1000x1000+0+0 % rsh
big xterm -display myws:0 -ls &lt;/dev/null &amp;</p>

<p>X servers listen for connections on a variety of
different communica- tions channels (network byte streams,
shared memory, etc.). Since there can be more than one way
of contacting a given server, The host- name part of the
display name is used to determine the type of channel (also
called a transport layer) to be used. X servers generally
sup- port the following types of connections:</p>

<p>local The hostname part of the display name should be
the empty string. For example: :0, :1, and :0.1. The most
efficient local transport will be chosen.</p>

<p>TCPIP The hostname part of the display name should be
the server machine s IP address name. Full Internet names,
abbreviated names, and IP addresses are all allowed. For
example: x.org:0, expo:0, 198.112.45.11:0, bigmachine:1, and
hydra:0.1.</p>

<p>DECnet The hostname part of the display name should be
the server machine s nodename, followed by two colons
instead of one. For example: myws::0, big::1, and
hydra::0.1.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL An X server can use several types of
access control. Mechanisms pro- vided in Release 6 are: Host
Access Simple host-based access control. MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
Shared plain-text &quot;cookies&quot;. XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1
Secure DES based private-keys. SUN-DES-1 Based on Suns
secure rpc system. MIT-KERBEROS-5 Kerberos Version 5
user-to-user.</p>

<p>Xdm initializes access control for the server and also
places autho- rization information in a file accessible to
the user. Normally, the list of hosts from which connections
are always accepted should be empty, so that only clients
with are explicitly authorized can connect to the display.
When you add entries to the host list (with xhost), the
server no longer performs any authorization on connections
from those machines. Be careful with this.</p>

<p>The file from which Xlib extracts authorization data can
be specified with the environment variable XAUTHORITY, and
defaults to the file .Xauthority in the home directory. Xdm
uses $HOME/.Xauthority and will create it or merge in
authorization records if it already exists when a user logs
in.</p>

<p>If you use several machines and share a common home
directory across all of the machines by means of a network
file system, you never really have to worry about
authorization files, the system should work cor- rectly by
default. Otherwise, as the authorization files are machine-
independent, you can simply copy the files to share them. To
manage authorization files, use xauth. This program allows
you to extract records and insert them into other files.
Using this, you can send authorization to remote machines
when you login, if the remote machine does not share a
common home directory with your local machine. Note that
authorization information transmitted in the clear through a
network file system or using ftp or rcp can be stolen by a
network eavesdropper, and as such may enable unauthorized
access. In many environments, this level of security is not
a concern, but if it is, you need to know the exact
semantics of the particular authorization data to know if
this is actually a problem.</p>

<p>For more information on access control, see the
Xsecurity manual page.</p>

<p>GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS One of the advantages of using
window systems instead of hardwired ter- minals is that
applications dont have to be restricted to a particular size
or location on the screen. Although the layout of windows on
a display is controlled by the window manager that the user
is running (described below), most X programs accept a
command line argument of the form -geometry
WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF (where WIDTH, HEIGHT, XOFF, and YOFF
are numbers) for specifying a preferred size and location
for this applications main window.</p>

<p>The WIDTH and HEIGHT parts of the geometry specification
are usually measured in either pixels or characters,
depending on the application. The XOFF and YOFF parts are
measured in pixels and are used to specify the distance of
the window from the left or right and top and bottom edges
of the screen, respectively. Both types of offsets are
measured from the indicated edge of the screen to the
corresponding edge of the window. The X offset may be
specified in the following ways:</p>

<p>+XOFF The left edge of the window is to be placed XOFF
pixels in from the left edge of the screen (i.e., the X
coordinate of the win- dow s origin will be XOFF). XOFF may
be negative, in which case the windows left edge will be off
the screen.</p>

<p>-XOFF The right edge of the window is to be placed XOFF
pixels in from the right edge of the screen. XOFF may be
negative, in which case the windows right edge will be off
the screen.</p>

<p>The Y offset has similar meanings:</p>

<p>+YOFF The top edge of the window is to be YOFF pixels
below the top edge of the screen (i.e., the Y coordinate of
the windows ori- gin will be YOFF). YOFF may be negative, in
which case the windows top edge will be off the screen.</p>

<p>-YOFF The bottom edge of the window is to be YOFF pixels
above the bottom edge of the screen. YOFF may be negative,
in which case the windows bottom edge will be off the
screen.</p>

<p>Offsets must be given as pairs; in other words, in order
to specify either XOFF or YOFF both must be present. Windows
can be placed in the four corners of the screen using the
following specifications:</p>

<p>+0+0 upper left hand corner.</p>

<p>-0+0 upper right hand corner.</p>

<p>-0-0 lower right hand corner.</p>

<p>+0-0 lower left hand corner.</p>

<p>In the following examples, a terminal emulator is placed
in roughly the center of the screen and a load average
monitor, mailbox, and clock are placed in the upper right
hand corner:</p>

<p>xterm -fn 6x10 -geometry 80x24+30+200 &amp; xclock
-geometry 48x48-0+0 &amp; xload -geometry 48x48-96+0 &amp;
xbiff -geometry 48x48-48+0 &amp;</p>

<p>WINDOW MANAGERS The layout of windows on the screen is
controlled by special programs called window managers.
Although many window managers will honor geom- etry
specifications as given, others may choose to ignore them
(requir- ing the user to explicitly draw the windows region
on the screen with the pointer, for example).</p>

<p>Since window managers are regular (albeit complex)
client programs, a variety of different user interfaces can
be built. The X.Org Founda- tion distribution comes with a
window manager named twm which supports overlapping windows,
popup menus, point-and-click or click-to-type input models,
title bars, nice icons (and an icon manager for those who
dont like separate icon windows).</p>

<p>See the user-contributed software in the X.Org
Foundation distribution for other popular window
managers.</p>

<p>FONT NAMES Collections of characters for displaying text
and symbols in X are known as fonts. A font typically
contains images that share a common appearance and look nice
together (for example, a single size, bold- ness, slant, and
character set). Similarly, collections of fonts that are
based on a common type face (the variations are usually
called roman, bold, italic, bold italic, oblique, and bold
oblique) are called families.</p>

<p>Fonts come in various sizes. The X server supports
scalable fonts, meaning it is possible to create a font of
arbitrary size from a single source for the font. The server
supports scaling from outline fonts and bitmap fonts.
Scaling from outline fonts usually produces signifi- cantly
better results than scaling from bitmap fonts.</p>

<p>An X server can obtain fonts from individual files
stored in directo- ries in the file system, or from one or
more font servers, or from a mixtures of directories and
font servers. The list of places the server looks when
trying to find a font is controlled by its font path.
Although most installations will choose to have the server
start up with all of the commonly used font directories in
the font path, the font path can be changed at any time with
the xset program. However, it is important to remember that
the directory names are on the servers machine, not on the
applications.</p>

<p>Bitmap font files are usually created by compiling a
textual font description into binary form, using bdftopcf.
Font databases are cre- ated by running the mkfontdir
program in the directory containing the source or compiled
versions of the fonts. Whenever fonts are added to a
directory, mkfontdir should be rerun so that the server can
find the new fonts. To make the server reread the font
database, reset the font path with the xset program. For
example, to add a font to a private directory, the following
commands could be used:</p>

<p>% cp newfont.pcf ~/myfonts % mkfontdir ~/myfonts % xset
fp rehash</p>

<p>The xfontsel and xlsfonts programs can be used to browse
through the fonts available on a server. Font names tend to
be fairly long as they contain all of the information needed
to uniquely identify individual fonts. However, the X server
supports wildcarding of font names, so the full
specification</p>


<p>-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1</p>

<p>might be abbreviated as:</p>

<p>-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1</p>

<p>Because the shell also has special meanings for * and ?,
wildcarded font names should be quoted:</p>

<p>% xlsfonts -fn
-*-courier-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*</p>

<p>The xlsfonts program can be used to list all of the
fonts that match a given pattern. With no arguments, it
lists all available fonts. This will usually list the same
font at many different sizes. To see just the base scalable
font names, try using one of the following patterns:</p>

<p>-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-0-0-*-0-*-*
-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-75-75-*-0-*-*
-*-*-*-*-*-*-0-0-100-100-*-0-*-*</p>

<p>To convert one of the resulting names into a font at a
specific size, replace one of the first two zeros with a
nonzero value. The field containing the first zero is for
the pixel size; replace it with a spe- cific height in
pixels to name a font at that size. Alternatively, the field
containing the second zero is for the point size; replace it
with a specific size in decipoints (there are 722.7
decipoints to the inch) to name a font at that size. The
last zero is an average width field, measured in tenths of
pixels; some servers will anamorphically scale if this value
is specified.</p>

<p>FONT SERVER NAMES One of the following forms can be used
to name a font server that accepts TCP connections:</p>

<p>tcp/hostname:port tcp/hostname:port/cataloguelist</p>

<p>The hostname specifies the name (or decimal numeric
address) of the machine on which the font server is running.
The port is the decimal TCP port on which the font server is
listening for connections. The cataloguelist specifies a
list of catalogue names, with + as a sepa- rator.</p>

<p>Examples: tcp/x.org:7100,
tcp/198.112.45.11:7100/all.</p>

<p>One of the following forms can be used to name a font
server that accepts DECnet connections:</p>

<p>decnet/nodename::font$objname
decnet/nodename::font$objname/cataloguelist</p>

<p>The nodename specifies the name (or decimal numeric
address) of the machine on which the font server is running.
The objname is a normal, case-insensitive DECnet object
name. The cataloguelist specifies a list of catalogue names,
with + as a separator.</p>

<p>Examples: DECnet/SRVNOD::FONT$DEFAULT,
decnet/44.70::font$special/sym- bols.</p>

<p>COLOR NAMES Most applications provide ways of tailoring
(usually through resources or command line arguments) the
colors of various elements in the text and graphics they
display. A color can be specified either by an abstract
color name, or by a numerical color specification. The
numer- ical specification can identify a color in either
device-dependent (RGB) or device-independent terms. Color
strings are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>X supports the use of abstract color names, for example,
&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;. A value for this abstract
name is obtained by searching one or more color name
databases. Xlib first searches zero or more client-side
databases; the number, location, and content of these
databases is implementation dependent. If the name is not
found, the color is looked up in the X servers database. The
text form of this database is commonly stored in the file
usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt.</p>

<p>A numerical color specification consists of a color
space name and a set of values in the following syntax:</p>


<p>&lt;color_space_name&gt;:&lt;value&gt;/.../&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>An RGB Device specification is identified by the prefix
&quot;rgb:&quot; and has the following syntax:</p>

<p>rgb:&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;red&gt;, &lt;green&gt;, &lt;blue&gt; := h | hh | hhh
| hhhh h := single hexadecimal digits Note that h indicates
the value scaled in 4 bits, hh the value scaled in 8 bits,
hhh the value scaled in 12 bits, and hhhh the value scaled
in 16 bits, respectively. These values are passed directly
to the X server, and are assumed to be gamma corrected.</p>

<p>The eight primary colors can be represented as:</p>

<p>black rgb:0/0/0 red rgb:ffff/0/0 green rgb:0/ffff/0 blue
rgb:0/0/ffff yellow rgb:ffff/ffff/0 magenta rgb:ffff/0/ffff
cyan rgb:0/ffff/ffff white rgb:ffff/ffff/ffff</p>

<p>For backward compatibility, an older syntax for RGB
Device is sup- ported, but its continued use is not
encouraged. The syntax is an ini- tial sharp sign character
followed by a numeric specification, in one of the following
formats:</p>

<p>#RGB (4 bits each) #RRGGBB (8 bits each) #RRRGGGBBB (12
bits each) #RRRRGGGGBBBB (16 bits each)</p>

<p>The R, G, and B represent single hexadecimal digits.
When fewer than 16 bits each are specified, they represent
the most-significant bits of the value (unlike the
&quot;rgb:&quot; syntax, in which values are scaled). For
example, #3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000.</p>

<p>An RGB intensity specification is identified by the
prefix &quot;rgbi:&quot; and has the following syntax:</p>

<p>rgbi:&lt;red&gt;/&lt;green&gt;/&lt;blue&gt;</p>

<p>The red, green, and blue are floating point values
between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. They represent linear
intensity values, with 1.0 indicating full intensity, 0.5
half intensity, and so on. These values will be gamma
corrected by Xlib before being sent to the X server. The
input format for these values is an optional sign, a string
of numbers possi- bly containing a decimal point, and an
optional exponent field contain- ing an E or e followed by a
possibly signed integer string.</p>

<p>The standard device-independent string specifications
have the follow- ing syntax:</p>

<p>CIEXYZ:&lt;X&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;/&lt;Z&gt; (none, 1, none)
CIEuvY:&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt;/&lt;Y&gt; (~.6, ~.6, 1)
CIExyY:&lt;x&gt;/&lt;y&gt;/&lt;Y&gt; (~.75, ~.85, 1)
CIELab:&lt;L&gt;/&lt;a&gt;/&lt;b&gt; (100, none, none)
CIELuv:&lt;L&gt;/&lt;u&gt;/&lt;v&gt; (100, none, none)
TekHVC:&lt;H&gt;/&lt;V&gt;/&lt;C&gt; (360, 100, 100)</p>

<p>All of the values (C, H, V, X, Y, Z, a, b, u, v, y, x)
are floating point values. Some of the values are
constrained to be between zero and some upper bound; the
upper bounds are given in parentheses above. The syntax for
these values is an optional + or - sign, a string of digits
possibly containing a decimal point, and an optional
exponent field consisting of an E or e followed by an
optional + or - followed by a string of digits.</p>

<p>For more information on device independent color, see
the Xlib refer- ence manual.</p>

<p>KEYBOARDS The X keyboard model is broken into two
layers: server-specific codes (called keycodes) which
represent the physical keys, and server-inde- pendent
symbols (called keysyms) which represent the letters or
words that appear on the keys. Two tables are kept in the
server for con- verting keycodes to keysyms:</p>

<p>modifier list Some keys (such as Shift, Control, and
Caps Lock) are known as modifier and are used to select
different symbols that are attached to a single key (such as
Shift-a generates a capital A, and Control-l generates a
control character ^L). The server keeps a list of keycodes
corresponding to the various modifier keys. Whenever a key
is pressed or released, the server gener- ates an event that
contains the keycode of the indicated key as well as a mask
that specifies which of the modifier keys are currently
pressed. Most servers set up this list to initially contain
the various shift, control, and shift lock keys on the
keyboard.</p>

<p>keymap table Applications translate event keycodes and
modifier masks into keysyms using a keysym table which
contains one row for each keycode and one column for various
modifier states. This table is initialized by the server to
correspond to normal typewriter conventions. The exact
semantics of how the table is inter- preted to produce
keysyms depends on the particular program, libraries, and
language input method used, but the following conventions
for the first four keysyms in each row are gener- ally
adhered to:</p>

<p>The first four elements of the list are split into two
groups of keysyms. Group 1 contains the first and second
keysyms; Group 2 con- tains the third and fourth keysyms.
Within each group, if the first element is alphabetic and
the the second element is the special keysym NoSymbol, then
the group is treated as equivalent to a group in which the
first element is the lowercase letter and the second element
is the uppercase letter.</p>

<p>Switching between groups is controlled by the keysym
named MODE SWITCH, by attaching that keysym to some key and
attaching that key to any one of the modifiers Mod1 through
Mod5. This modifier is called the group modifier. Group 1 is
used when the group modifier is off, and Group 2 is used
when the group modifier is on.</p>

<p>Within a group, the modifier state determines which
keysym to use. The first keysym is used when the Shift and
Lock modifiers are off. The second keysym is used when the
Shift modifier is on, when the Lock mod- ifier is on and the
second keysym is uppercase alphabetic, or when the Lock
modifier is on and is interpreted as ShiftLock. Otherwise,
when the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted as CapsLock,
the state of the Shift modifier is applied first to select a
keysym; but if that keysym is lowercase alphabetic, then the
corresponding uppercase keysym is used instead.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most X programs attempt to use the same names
for command line options and arguments. All applications
written with the X Toolkit Intrinsics automatically accept
the following options:</p>

<p>-display display This option specifies the name of the X
server to use.</p>

<p>-geometry geometry This option specifies the initial
size and location of the win- dow.</p>

<p>-bg color, -background color Either option specifies the
color to use for the window back- ground.</p>

<p>-bd color, -bordercolor color Either option specifies
the color to use for the window border.</p>

<p>-bw number, -borderwidth number Either option specifies
the width in pixels of the window bor- der.</p>

<p>-fg color, -foreground color Either option specifies the
color to use for text or graphics.</p>

<p>-fn font, -font font Either option specifies the font to
use for displaying text.</p>

<p>-iconic This option indicates that the user would prefer
that the applications windows initially not be visible as if
the win- dows had be immediately iconified by the user.
Window managers may choose not to honor the applications
request.</p>

<p>-name This option specifies the name under which
resources for the application should be found. This option
is useful in shell aliases to distinguish between
invocations of an application, without resorting to creating
links to alter the executable file name.</p>

<p>-rv, -reverse Either option indicates that the program
should simulate reverse video if possible, often by swapping
the foreground and background colors. Not all programs honor
this or implement it correctly. It is usually only used on
monochrome displays.</p>

<p>+rv This option indicates that the program should not
simulate reverse video. This is used to override any
defaults since reverse video doesnt always work
properly.</p>

<p>-selectionTimeout This option specifies the timeout in
milliseconds within which two communicating applications
must respond to one another for a selection request.</p>

<p>-synchronous This option indicates that requests to the
X server should be sent synchronously, instead of
asynchronously. Since Xlib nor- mally buffers requests to
the server, errors do not necessarily get reported
immediately after they occur. This option turns off the
buffering so that the application can be debugged. It should
never be used with a working program.</p>

<p>-title string This option specifies the title to be used
for this window. This information is sometimes used by a
window manager to pro- vide some sort of header identifying
the window.</p>

<p>-xnllanguage language[_territory][.codeset] This option
specifies the language, territory, and codeset for use in
resolving resource and other filenames.</p>

<p>-xrm resourcestring This option specifies a resource
name and value to override any defaults. It is also very
useful for setting resources that dont have explicit command
line arguments.</p>

<p>RESOURCES To make the tailoring of applications to
personal preferences easier, X provides a mechanism for
storing default values for program resources (e.g.
background color, window title, etc.) Resources are
specified as strings that are read in from various places
when an application is run. Program components are named in
a hierarchical fashion, with each node in the hierarchy
identified by a class and an instance name. At the top level
is the class and instance name of the application itself. By
convention, the class name of the application is the same as
the program name, but with the first letter capitalized
(e.g. Bitmap or Emacs) although some programs that begin
with the letter x also capitalize the second letter for
historical reasons.</p>

<p>The precise syntax for resources is:</p>

<p>ResourceLine = Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec |
&lt;empty line&gt; Comment = &quot;!&quot; {&lt;any
character except null or newline&gt;} IncludeFile =
&quot;#&quot; WhiteSpace &quot;include&quot; WhiteSpace
FileName WhiteSpace FileName = &lt;valid filename for
operating system&gt; ResourceSpec = WhiteSpace ResourceName
WhiteSpace &quot;:&quot; WhiteSpace Value ResourceName =
[Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName Binding =
&quot;.&quot; | &quot;*&quot; WhiteSpace = {&lt;space&gt; |
&lt;horizontal tab&gt;} Component = &quot;?&quot; |
ComponentName ComponentName = NameChar {NameChar} NameChar =
&quot;a&quot;-&quot;z&quot; | &quot;A&quot;-&quot;Z&quot; |
&quot;0&quot;-&quot;9&quot; | &quot;_&quot; | &quot;-&quot;
Value = {&lt;any character except null or unescaped
newline&gt;}</p>

<p>Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.
Curly braces ({...}) indicate zero or more repetitions of
the enclosed elements. Square brackets ([...]) indicate that
the enclosed element is optional. Quotes (&quot;...&quot;)
are used around literal characters.</p>

<p>IncludeFile lines are interpreted by replacing the line
with the con- tents of the specified file. The word
&quot;include&quot; must be in lowercase. The filename is
interpreted relative to the directory of the file in which
the line occurs (for example, if the filename contains no
direc- tory or contains a relative directory
specification).</p>

<p>If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of two
or more Binding characters, the sequence will be replaced
with single &quot;.&quot; character if the sequence contains
only &quot;.&quot; characters, otherwise the sequence will
be replaced with a single &quot;*&quot; character.</p>

<p>A resource database never contains more than one entry
for a given ResourceName. If a resource file contains
multiple lines with the same ResourceName, the last line in
the file is used.</p>

<p>Any whitespace character before or after the name or
colon in a ResourceSpec are ignored. To allow a Value to
begin with whitespace, the two-character sequence space
(backslash followed by space) is recognized and replaced by
a space character, and the two-character sequence tab
(backslash followed by horizontal tab) is recognized and
replaced by a horizontal tab character. To allow a Value to
con- tain embedded newline characters, the two-character is
sequence 0 recognized and replaced by a newline character.
To allow a Value to be broken across multiple lines in a
text file, the two-character sequence newline (backslash
followed by newline) is recognized and removed from the
value. To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character
codes, the four-character sequence nnn, where each n is a
digit character in the range of 0-7, is recognized and
replaced with a single byte that contains the octal value
specified by the sequence. Finally, the two-character
sequence \ is recognized and replaced with a single
backslash.</p>

<p>When an application looks for the value of a resource,
it specifies a complete path in the hierarchy, with both
class and instance names. However, resource values are
usually given with only partially speci- fied names and
classes, using pattern matching constructs. An asterisk (*)
is a loose binding and is used to represent any number of
interven- ing components, including none. A period (.) is a
tight binding and is used to separate immediately adjacent
components. A question mark (?) is used to match any single
component name or class. A database entry cannot end in a
loose binding; the final component (which cannot be
&quot;?&quot;) must be specified. The lookup algorithm
searches the resource database for the entry that most
closely matches (is most specific for) the full name and
class being queried. When more than one database entry
matches the full name and class, precedence rules are used
to select just one.</p>

<p>The full name and class are scanned from left to right
(from highest level in the hierarchy to lowest), one
component at a time. At each level, the corresponding
component and/or binding of each matching entry is
determined, and these matching components and bindings are
compared according to precedence rules. Each of the rules is
applied at each level, before moving to the next level,
until a rule selects a single entry over all others. The
rules (in order of precedence) are:</p>

<p>1. An entry that contains a matching component (whether
name, class, or &quot;?&quot;) takes precedence over entries
that elide the level (that is, entries that match the level
in a loose binding).</p>

<p>2. An entry with a matching name takes precedence over
both entries with a matching class and entries that match
using &quot;?&quot;. An entry with a matching class takes
precedence over entries that match using &quot;?&quot;.</p>

<p>3. An entry preceded by a tight binding takes precedence
over entries preceded by a loose binding.</p>

<p>Programs based on the X Tookit Intrinsics obtain
resources from the following sources (other programs usually
support some subset of these sources):</p>

<p>RESOURCE_MANAGER root window property Any global
resources that should be available to clients on all
machines should be stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property
on the root window of the first screen using the xrdb
program. This is frequently taken care of when the user
starts up X through the display manager or xinit.</p>

<p>SCREEN_RESOURCES root window property Any resources
specific to a given screen (e.g. colors) that should be
available to clients on all machines should be stored in the
SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of that screen.
The xrdb program will sort resources automatically and place
them in RESOURCE_MANAGER or SCREEN_RESOURCES, as appro-
priate.</p>

<p>application-specific files Directories named by the
environment variable XUSERFILESEARCH- PATH or the
environment variable XAPPLRESDIR (which names a single
directory and should end with a / on POSIX systems), plus
directories in a standard place (usually under
/usr/lib/X11/, but this can be overridden with the
XFILESEARCH- PATH environment variable) are searched for for
application- specific resources. For example, application
default resources are usually kept in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/. See the X Toolkit Intrinsics - C
Language Interface manual for details.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT Any user- and machine-specific resources
may be specified by setting the XENVIRONMENT environment
variable to the name of a resource file to be loaded by all
applications. If this vari- able is not defined, a file
named $HOME/.Xdefaults-hostname is looked for instead, where
hostname is the name of the host where the application is
executing.</p>

<p>-xrm resourcestring Resources can also be specified from
the command line. The resourcestring is a single resource
name and value as shown above. Note that if the string
contains characters interpreted by the shell (e.g.,
asterisk), they must be quoted. Any number of -xrm arguments
may be given on the command line.</p>

<p>Program resources are organized into groups called
classes, so that collections of individual resources (each
of which are called instances) can be set all at once. By
convention, the instance name of a resource begins with a
lowercase letter and class name with an upper case letter.
Multiple word resources are concatenated with the first
letter of the succeeding words capitalized. Applications
written with the X Toolkit Intrinsics will have at least the
following resources:</p>

<p>background (class Background) This resource specifies
the color to use for the window back- ground.</p>

<p>borderWidth (class BorderWidth) This resource specifies
the width in pixels of the window bor- der.</p>

<p>borderColor (class BorderColor) This resource specifies
the color to use for the window border.</p>

<p>Most applications using the X Toolkit Intrinsics also
have the resource foreground (class Foreground), specifying
the color to use for text and graphics within the
window.</p>

<p>By combining class and instance specifications,
application preferences can be set quickly and easily. Users
of color displays will frequently want to set Background and
Foreground classes to particular defaults. Specific color
instances such as text cursors can then be overridden
without having to define all of the related resources. For
example,</p>

<p>bitmap*Dashed: off XTerm*cursorColor: gold
XTerm*multiScroll: on XTerm*jumpScroll: on
XTerm*reverseWrap: on XTerm*curses: on XTerm*Font: 6x10
XTerm*scrollBar: on XTerm*scrollbar*thickness: 5
XTerm*multiClickTime: 500 XTerm*charClass:
33:48,37:48,45-47:48,64:48 XTerm*cutNewline: off
XTerm*cutToBeginningOfLine: off XTerm*titeInhibit: on
XTerm*ttyModes: intr ^c erase ^? kill ^u XLoad*Background:
gold XLoad*Foreground: red XLoad*highlight: black
XLoad*borderWidth: 0 emacs*Geometry: 80x65-0-0
emacs*Background: rgb:5b/76/86 emacs*Foreground: white
emacs*Cursor: white emacs*BorderColor: white emacs*Font:
6x10 xmag*geometry: -0-0 xmag*borderColor: white</p>

<p>If these resources were stored in a file called
.Xresources in your home directory, they could be added to
any existing resources in the server with the following
command:</p>

<p>% xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources</p>

<p>This is frequently how user-friendly startup scripts
merge user-spe- cific defaults into any site-wide defaults.
All sites are encouraged to set up convenient ways of
automatically loading resources. See the Xlib manual section
Resource Manager Functions for more information.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT DISPLAY This is the only mandatory
environment variable. It must point to an X server. See
section &quot;Display Names&quot; above.</p>

<p>XAUTHORITY This must point to a file that contains
authorization data. The default is $HOME/.Xauthority. See
Xsecurity(7), xauth(1), xdm(1), Xau(3).</p>

<p>ICEAUTHORITY This must point to a file that contains
authorization data. The default is $HOME/.ICEauthority.</p>

<p>LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG The first non-empty value among
these three determines the cur- rent locales facet for
character handling, and in particular the default text
encoding. See locale(7), setlocale(3), locale(1).</p>

<p>XMODIFIERS This variable can be set to contain
additional information important for the current locale
setting. Typically set to @im=&lt;input-method&gt; to enable
a particular input method. See XSetLocaleModifiers(3).</p>

<p>XLOCALEDIR This must point to a directory containing the
locale.alias file and Compose and XLC_LOCALE file
hierarchies for all locales. The default value is
/usr/lib/X11/locale.</p>

<p>XENVIRONMENT This must point to a file containing X
resources. The default is $HOME/.Xdefaults-&lt;hostname&gt;.
Unlike /usr/lib/X11/Xresources, it is consulted each time an
X application starts.</p>

<p>XFILESEARCHPATH This must contain a colon separated list
of path templates, where libXt will search for resource
files. The default value consists of</p>

<p>/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S:
/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S:
/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S: /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S</p>

<p>A path template is transformed to a pathname by
substituting:</p>

<p>%N =&gt; name (basename) being searched for %T =&gt;
type (dirname) being searched for %S =&gt; suffix being
searched for %C =&gt; value of the resource
&quot;customization&quot; (class &quot;Customization&quot;)
%L =&gt; the locale name %l =&gt; the locales language (part
before _) %t =&gt; the locales territory (part after _ but
before .) %c =&gt; the locales encoding (part after .)</p>

<p>XUSERFILESEARCHPATH This must contain a colon separated
list of path templates, where libXt will search for user
dependent resource files. The default value is:</p>

<p>$XAPPLRESDIR/%L/%N%C: $XAPPLRESDIR/%l/%N%C:
$XAPPLRESDIR/%N%C: $HOME/%N%C: $XAPPLRESDIR/%L/%N:
$XAPPLRESDIR/%l/%N: $XAPPLRESDIR/%N: $HOME/%N</p>

<p>$XAPPLRESDIR defaults to $HOME, see below.</p>

<p>A path template is transformed to a pathname by
substituting:</p>

<p>%N =&gt; name (basename) being searched for %T =&gt;
type (dirname) being searched for %S =&gt; suffix being
searched for %C =&gt; value of the resource
&quot;customization&quot; (class &quot;Customization&quot;)
%L =&gt; the locale name %l =&gt; the locales language (part
before _) %t =&gt; the locales territory (part after _ but
before .) %c =&gt; the locales encoding (part after .)</p>

<p>XAPPLRESDIR This must point to a base directory where
the user stores his application dependent resource files.
The default value is $HOME. Only used if XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
is not set.</p>

<p>XKEYSYMDB This must point to a file containing
nonstandard keysym defini- tions. The default value is
/usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB.</p>

<p>XCMSDB This must point to a color name database file.
The default value is usr/lib/X11/Xcms.txt.</p>

<p>XFT_CONFIG This must point to a configuration file for
the Xft library. The default value is
/usr/lib/X11/XftConfig.</p>

<p>RESOURCE_NAME This serves as main identifier for
resources belonging to the program being executed. It
defaults to the basename of pathname of the program.</p>

<p>SESSION_MANAGER Denotes the session manager the
application should connect. See xsm(1), rstart(1).</p>

<p>XF86BIGFONT_DISABLE Setting this variable to a non-empty
value disables the XFree86-Bigfont extension. This extension
is a mechanism to reduce the memory consumption of big fonts
by use of shared mem- ory.</p>

<p>XKB_FORCE XKB_DISABLE XKB_DEBUG _XKB_CHARSET
_XKB_LOCALE_CHARSETS _XKB_OPTIONS_ENABLE _XKB_LATIN1_LOOKUP
_XKB_CONSUME_LOOKUP_MODS _XKB_CONSUME_SHIFT_AND_LOCK
_XKB_IGNORE_NEW_KEYBOARDS _XKB_CONTROL_FALLBACK
_XKB_COMP_LED _XKB_COMP_FAIL_BEEP</p>

<p>These variables influence the X Keyboard Extension.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following is a collection of sample command
lines for some of the more frequently used commands. For
more information on a particular command, please refer to
that commands manual page.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS A wide variety of error messages are
generated from various programs. The default error handler
in Xlib (also used by many toolkits) uses standard resources
to construct diagnostic messages when errors occur. The
defaults for these messages are usually stored in
usr/lib/X11/XEr- rorDB. If this file is not present, error
messages will be rather terse and cryptic.</p>

<p>When the X Toolkit Intrinsics encounter errors
converting resource strings to the appropriate internal
format, no error messages are usu- ally printed. This is
convenient when it is desirable to have one set of resources
across a variety of displays (e.g. color vs. monochrome,
lots of fonts vs. very few, etc.), although it can pose
problems for trying to determine why an application might be
failing. This behavior can be overridden by the setting the
StringConversionsWarning resource.</p>

<p>To force the X Toolkit Intrinsics to always print string
conversion error messages, the following resource should be
placed in the file that gets loaded onto the
RESOURCE_MANAGER property using the xrdb pro- gram
(frequently called .Xresources or .Xres in the users home
direc- tory):</p>

<p>*StringConversionWarnings: on</p>

<p>To have conversion messages printed for just a
particular application, the appropriate instance name can be
placed before the asterisk:</p>

<p>xterm*StringConversionWarnings: on</p>
