<p>mkmanifest(1) mkmanifest(1)</p>

<p>Name mkmanifest - makes list of file names and their DOS
8+3 equivalent</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mkmanifest command is used to create a
shell script (packing list) to restore Unix filenames. Its
syntax is:</p>

<p>mkmanifest [ files ]</p>

<p>Mkmanifest creates a shell script that aids in the
restoration of Unix filenames that got clobbered by the
MS-DOS filename restrictions. MS- DOS filenames are
restricted to 8 character names, 3 character exten- sions,
upper case only, no device names, and no illegal
characters.</p>

<p>The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods
used in pcomm, arc, and mtools to change perfectly good Unix
filenames to fit the MS- DOS restrictions. This command is
only useful if the target system which will read the
diskette cannot handle vfat long names.</p>

<p>Example You want to copy the following Unix files to a
MS-DOS diskette (using the mcopy command).</p>

<p>very_long_name 2.many.dots illegal: good.c prn.dev
Capital</p>

<p>Mcopy converts the names to:</p>

<p>very_lon 2xmany.dot illegalx good.c xprn.dev capital</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>mkmanifest very_long_name 2.many.dots illegal: good.c
prn.dev Capital &gt;manifest</p>

<p>would produce the following:</p>

<p>mv very_lon very_long_name mv 2xmany.dot 2.many.dots mv
illegalx illegal: mv xprn.dev prn.dev mv capital Capital</p>

<p>Notice that &quot;good.c&quot; did not require any
conversion, so it did not appear in the output.</p>

<p>Suppose I ve copied these files from the diskette to
another Unix sys- tem, and I now want the files back to
their original names. If the file &quot;manifest&quot; (the
output captured above) was sent along with those files, it
could be used to convert the filenames.</p>

<p>Bugs The short names generated by mkmanifest follow the
old convention (from mtools-2.0.7) and not the one from
Windows 95 and mtools-3.0.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
