<p>XTextExtents(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XTextExtents(3)</p>

<p>NAME XTextExtents, XTextExtents16, XQueryTextExtents,
XQueryTextExtents16 - compute or query text extents</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XTextExtents(XFontStruct *font_struct, char
*string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int
*font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct
*overall_return);</p>

<p>int XTextExtents16(XFontStruct *font_struct, XChar2b
*string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int
*font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct
*overall_return);</p>

<p>int XQueryTextExtents(Display *display, XID font_ID,
char *string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int
*font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct
*overall_return);</p>

<p>int XQueryTextExtents16(Display *display, XID font_ID,
XChar2b *string, int nchars, int *direction_return, int
*font_ascent_return, int *font_descent_return, XCharStruct
*overall_return);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS direction_return Returns the value of the
direction hint (FontLeftToRight or FontRightToLeft).</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>font_ID Specifies either the font ID or the GContext ID
that contains the font.</p>

<p>font_ascent_return Returns the font ascent.</p>

<p>font_descent_return Returns the font descent.</p>

<p>font_struct Specifies the XFontStruct structure.</p>

<p>nchars Specifies the number of characters in the
character string.</p>

<p>string Specifies the character string.</p>

<p>overall_return Returns the overall size in the specified
XCharStruct struc- ture.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XTextExtents and XTextExtents16
functions perform the size computa- tion locally and,
thereby, avoid the round-trip overhead of XQueryTex-
tExtents and XQueryTextExtents16. Both functions return an
XCharStruct structure, whose members are set to the values
as follows.</p>

<p>The ascent member is set to the maximum of the ascent
metrics of all characters in the string. The descent member
is set to the maximum of the descent metrics. The width
member is set to the sum of the charac- ter-width metrics of
all characters in the string. For each character in the
string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of
all characters preceding it in the string. Let L be the
left-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. Let R be
the right-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. The
lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all characters in
the string. The rbearing member is set to the maximum R.</p>

<p>For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than
2-byte matrix index- ing, each XChar2b structure is
interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most
significant byte. If the font has no defined default
character, undefined characters in the string are taken to
have all zero metrics.</p>

<p>The XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16 functions
return the bounding box of the specified 8-bit and 16-bit
character string in the specified font or the font contained
in the specified GC. These func- tions query the X server
and, therefore, suffer the round-trip overhead that is
avoided by XTextExtents and XTextExtents16. Both functions
return a XCharStruct structure, whose members are set to the
values as follows.</p>

<p>The ascent member is set to the maximum of the ascent
metrics of all characters in the string. The descent member
is set to the maximum of the descent metrics. The width
member is set to the sum of the charac- ter-width metrics of
all characters in the string. For each character in the
string, let W be the sum of the character-width metrics of
all characters preceding it in the string. Let L be the
left-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. Let R be
the right-side-bearing metric of the character plus W. The
lbearing member is set to the minimum L of all characters in
the string. The rbearing member is set to the maximum R.</p>

<p>For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than
2-byte matrix index- ing, each XChar2b structure is
interpreted as a 16-bit number with byte1 as the most
significant byte. If the font has no defined default
character, undefined characters in the string are taken to
have all zero metrics.</p>

<p>Characters with all zero metrics are ignored. If the
font has no defined default_char, the undefined characters
in the string are also ignored.</p>

<p>XQueryTextExtents and XQueryTextExtents16 can generate
BadFont and BadGC errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadFont A value for a Font or GContext
argument does not name a defined Font.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>
