<p>GREP(1) GREP(1)</p>

<p>NAME grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines matching a
pattern</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...] grep [OPTIONS]
[-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION grep searches the named input FILEs (or
standard input if no files are named, or if a single
hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing
a match to the given PATTERN. By default, grep prints the
matching lines.</p>

<p>In addition, two variant programs egrep and fgrep are
available. egrep is the same as grep -E. fgrep is the same
as grep -F. Direct invocation as either egrep or fgrep is
deprecated, but is provided to allow historical applications
that rely on them to run unmodified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Generic Program Information --help Print a usage
message briefly summarizing these command-line options and
the bug-reporting address, then exit.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the version number of grep to the
standard output stream. This version number should be
included in all bug reports (see below).</p>

<p>Matcher Selection -E, --extended-regexp Interpret
PATTERN as an extended regular expression (ERE, see below).
(-E is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-F, --fixed-strings, --fixed-regexp Interpret PATTERN as
a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of which
is to be matched. (-F is specified by POSIX, --fixed-regexp
is an obsoleted alias, please do not use it new
scripts.)</p>

<p>-G, --basic-regexp Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular
expression (BRE, see below). This is the default.</p>

<p>-P, --perl-regexp Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular
expression. This is highly experimental and grep -P may warn
of unimplemented features.</p>

<p>Matching Control -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN Use
PATTERN as the pattern. This can be used to specify multiple
search patterns, or to protect a pattern beginning with a
hyphen (-). (-e is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-f FILE, --file=FILE Obtain patterns from FILE, one per
line. The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore
matches nothing. (-f is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case Ignore case distinctions in both the
PATTERN and the input files. (-i is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-v, --invert-match Invert the sense of matching, to
select non-matching lines. (-v is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-w, --word-regexp Select only those lines containing
matches that form whole words. The test is that the matching
substring must either be at the beginning of the line, or
preceded by a non-word constituent character. Similarly, it
must be either at the end of the line or followed by a
non-word constituent character. Word-constituent characters
are letters, digits, and the underscore.</p>

<p>-x, --line-regexp Select only those matches that exactly
match the whole line. (-x is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-y Obsolete synonym for -i.</p>

<p>General Output Control -c, --count Suppress normal
output; instead print a count of matching lines for each
input file. With the -v, --invert-match option (see below),
count non-matching lines. (-c is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>--color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN] Surround the matched
(non-empty) strings, matching lines, context lines, file
names, line numbers, byte offsets, and separators (for
fields and groups of context lines) with escape sequences to
display them in color on the terminal. The colors are
defined by the environment variable GREP_COLORS. The
deprecated environment variable GREP_COLOR is still
supported, but its setting does not have priority. WHEN is
never, always, or auto.</p>

<p>-L, --files-without-match Suppress normal output;
instead print the name of each input file from which no
output would normally have been printed. The scanning will
stop on the first match.</p>

<p>-l, --files-with-matches Suppress normal output; instead
print the name of each input file from which output would
normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the
first match. (-l is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-m NUM, --max-count=NUM Stop reading a file after NUM
matching lines. If the input is standard input from a
regular file, and NUM matching lines are output, grep
ensures that the standard input is positioned to just after
the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the
presence of trailing context lines. This enables a calling
process to resume a search. When grep stops after NUM
matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines. When
the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not output
a count greater than NUM. When the -v or --invert-match
option is also used, grep stops after outputting NUM
non-matching lines.</p>

<p>-o, --only-matching Print only the matched (non-empty)
parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate
output line.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet, --silent Quiet; do not write anything to
standard output. Exit immediately with zero status if any
match is found, even if an error was detected. Also see the
-s or --no-messages option. (-q is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-s, --no-messages Suppress error messages about
nonexistent or unreadable files. Portability note: unlike
GNU grep, 7th Edition Unix grep did not conform to POSIX,
because it lacked -q and its -s option behaved like GNU
greps -q option. USG-style grep also lacked -q but its -s
option behaved like GNU grep. Portable shell scripts should
avoid both -q and -s and should redirect standard and error
output to /dev/null instead. (-s is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p>Output Line Prefix Control -b, --byte-offset Print the
0-based byte offset within the input file before each line
of output. If -o (--only-matching) is specified, print the
offset of the matching part itself.</p>

<p>-H, --with-filename Print the file name for each match.
This is the default when there is more than one file to
search.</p>

<p>-h, --no-filename Suppress the prefixing of file names
on output. This is the default when there is only one file
(or only standard input) to search.</p>

<p>--label=LABEL Display input actually coming from
standard input as input coming from file LABEL. This is
especially useful when implementing tools like zgrep, e.g.,
gzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H something. See also
the -H option.</p>

<p>-n, --line-number Prefix each line of output with the
1-based line number within its input file. (-n is specified
by POSIX.)</p>

<p>-T, --initial-tab Make sure that the first character of
actual line content lies on a tab stop, so that the
alignment of tabs looks normal. This is useful with options
that prefix their output to the actual content: -H,-n, and
-b. In order to improve the probability that lines from a
single file will all start at the same column, this also
causes the line number and byte offset (if present) to be
printed in a minimum size field width.</p>

<p>-u, --unix-byte-offsets Report Unix-style byte offsets.
This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the
file were a Unix-style text file, i.e., with CR characters
stripped off. This will produce results identical to running
grep on a Unix machine. This option has no effect unless -b
option is also used; it has no effect on platforms other
than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.</p>

<p>-Z, --null Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character)
instead of the character that normally follows a file name.
For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file
name instead of the usual newline. This option makes the
output unambiguous, even in the presence of file names
containing unusual characters like newlines. This option can
be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z,
and xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those
that contain newline characters.</p>

<p>Context Line Control -A NUM, --after-context=NUM Print
NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines. Places a
line containing a group separator (described under
--group-separator) between contiguous groups of matches.
With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect
and a warning is given.</p>

<p>-B NUM, --before-context=NUM Print NUM lines of leading
context before matching lines. Places a line containing a
group separator (described under --group-separator) between
contiguous groups of matches. With the -o or --only-matching
option, this has no effect and a warning is given.</p>

<p>-C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM Print NUM lines of output
context. Places a line containing a group separator
(described under --group-separator) between contiguous
groups of matches. With the -o or --only-matching option,
this has no effect and a warning is given.</p>

<p>--group-separator=SEP Use SEP as a group separator. By
default SEP is double hyphen (--).</p>

<p>--no-group-separator Use empty string as a group
separator.</p>

<p>File and Directory Selection -a, --text Process a binary
file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the
--binary-files=text option.</p>

<p>--binary-files=TYPE If the first few bytes of a file
indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the
file is of type TYPE. By default, TYPE is binary, and grep
normally outputs either a one-line message saying that a
binary file matches, or no message if there is no match. If
TYPE is without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does
not match; this is equivalent to the -I option. If TYPE is
text, grep processes a binary file as if it were text; this
is equivalent to the -a option. Warning: grep
--binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can
have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if
the terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.</p>

<p>-D ACTION, --devices=ACTION If an input file is a
device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to process it. By
default, ACTION is read, which means that devices are read
just as if they were ordinary files. If ACTION is skip,
devices are silently skipped.</p>

<p>-d ACTION, --directories=ACTION If an input file is a
directory, use ACTION to process it. By default, ACTION is
read, i.e., read directories just as if they were ordinary
files. If ACTION is skip, silently skip directories. If
ACTION is recurse, read all files under each directory,
recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on
the command line. This is equivalent to the -r option.</p>

<p>--exclude=GLOB Skip files whose base name matches GLOB
(using wildcard matching). A file-name glob can use *, ?,
and [...] as wildcards, and to quote a wildcard or backslash
character literally.</p>

<p>--exclude-from=FILE Skip files whose base name matches
any of the file-name globs read from FILE (using wildcard
matching as described under --exclude).</p>

<p>--exclude-dir=DIR Exclude directories matching the
pattern DIR from recursive searches.</p>

<p>-I Process a binary file as if it did not contain
matching data; this is equivalent to the
--binary-files=without-match option.</p>

<p>--include=GLOB Search only files whose base name matches
GLOB (using wildcard matching as described under
--exclude).</p>

<p>-r, --recursive Read all files under each directory,
recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on
the command line. This is equivalent to the -d recurse
option.</p>

<p>-R, --dereference-recursive Read all files under each
directory, recursively. Follow all symbolic links, unlike
-r.</p>

<p>Other Options --line-buffered Use line buffering on
output. This can cause a performance penalty.</p>

<p>-U, --binary Treat the file(s) as binary. By default,
under MS-DOS and MS- Windows, grep guesses the file type by
looking at the contents of the first 32KB read from the
file. If grep decides the file is a text file, it strips the
CR characters from the original file contents (to make
regular expressions with ^ and $ work correctly). Specifying
-U overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read
and passed to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file
is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line,
this will cause some regular expressions to fail. This
option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-
Windows.</p>

<p>-z, --null-data Treat the input as a set of lines, each
terminated by a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead
of a newline. Like the -Z or --null option, this option can
be used with commands like sort -z to process arbitrary file
names.</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS A regular expression is a pattern
that describes a set of strings. Regular expressions are
constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using
various operators to combine smaller expressions.</p>

<p>grep understands three different versions of regular
expression syntax: basic, extended and perl. In GNU grep,
there is no difference in available functionality between
basic and extended syntaxes. In other implementations, basic
regular expressions are less powerful. The following
description applies to extended regular expressions;
differences for basic regular expressions are summarized
afterwards. Perl regular expressions give additional
functionality, and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and
pcrepattern(3), but may not be available on every
system.</p>

<p>The fundamental building blocks are the regular
expressions that match a single character. Most characters,
including all letters and digits, are regular expressions
that match themselves. Any meta-character with special
meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.</p>

<p>The period . matches any single character.</p>

<p>Character Classes and Bracket Expressions A bracket
expression is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ]. It
matches any single character in that list; if the first
character of the list is the caret ^ then it matches any
character not in the list. For example, the regular
expression [0123456789] matches any single digit.</p>

<p>Within a bracket expression, a range expression consists
of two characters separated by a hyphen. It matches any
single character that sorts between the two characters,
inclusive, using the locales collating sequence and
character set. For example, in the default C locale, [a-d]
is equivalent to [abcd]. Many locales sort characters in
dictionary order, and in these locales [a-d] is typically
not equivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to
[aBbCcDd], for example. To obtain the traditional
interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C
locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the
value C.</p>

<p>Finally, certain named classes of characters are
predefined within bracket expressions, as follows. Their
names are self explanatory, and they are [:alnum:],
[:alpha:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:],
[:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:].
For example, [[:alnum:]] means the character class of
numbers and letters in the current locale. In the C locale
and ASCII character set encoding, this is the same as
[0-9A-Za-z]. (Note that the brackets in these class names
are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in
addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.)
Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside
bracket expressions. To include a literal ] place it first
in the list. Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it
anywhere but first. Finally, to include a literal - place it
last.</p>

<p>Anchoring The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are
meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at
the beginning and end of a line.</p>

<p>The Backslash Character and Special Expressions The
symbols&lt; and&gt; respectively match the empty string at
the b m a t c h e s t h e e beginning and end of a word. The
symbolm p t y s t r i n g a t the edge of a word, and0not at
the edge of a word. The symbol480[_[:alnum:]] and W is a
synonym for [^_[:alnum:]].</p>

<p>Repetition A regular expression may be followed by one
of several repetition operators: ? The preceding item is
optional and matched at most once. * The preceding item will
be matched zero or more times. + The preceding item will be
matched one or more times. {n} The preceding item is matched
exactly n times. {n,} The preceding item is matched n or
more times. {,m} The preceding item is matched at most m
times. This is a GNU extension. {n,m} The preceding item is
matched at least n times, but not more than m times.</p>

<p>Concatenation Two regular expressions may be
concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any
string formed by concatenating two substrings that
respectively match the concatenated expressions.</p>

<p>Alternation Two regular expressions may be joined by the
infix operator |; the resulting regular expression matches
any string matching either alternate expression.</p>

<p>Precedence Repetition takes precedence over
concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over
alternation. A whole expression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these precedence rules and form a
subexpression.</p>

<p>Back References and Subexpressions The back-referencen,
where n is a single digit, matches the substring previously
matched by the nth parenthesized subexpression of the
regular expression.</p>

<p>Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions In basic regular
expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose
their special meaning; instead use the backslashed versions
+{|,(, an).</p>

<p>Traditional egrep did not support the { meta-character,
and some egrep implementations support{ instead, so portable
scripts should avoid { in grep -E patterns and should use
[{] to match a literal {.</p>

<p>GNU grep -E attempts to support traditional usage by
assuming that { is not special if it would be the start of
an invalid interval specification. For example, the command
grep -E{1searches for the two-character string {1 instead of
reporting a syntax error in the regular expression. POSIX
allows this behavior as an extension, but portable scripts
should avoid it.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The behavior of grep is affected
by the following environment variables.</p>

<p>The locale for category LC_foo is specified by examining
the three environment variables LC_ALL, LC_foo, LANG, in
that order. The first of these variables that is set
specifies the locale. For example, if LC_ALL is not set, but
LC_MESSAGES is set to pt_BR, then the Brazilian Portuguese
locale is used for the LC_MESSAGES category. The C locale is
used if none of these environment variables are set, if the
locale catalog is not installed, or if grep was not compiled
with national language support (NLS).</p>

<p>GREP_OPTIONS This variable specifies default options to
be placed in front of any explicit options. For example, if
GREP_OPTIONS is --binary-files=without-match
--directories=skip , grep behaves as if the two options
--binary-files=without-match and --directories=skip had been
specified before any explicit options. Option specifications
are separated by whitespace. A backslash escapes the next
character, so it can be used to specify an option containing
whitespace or a backslash.</p>

<p>GREP_COLOR This variable specifies the color used to
highlight matched (non-empty) text. It is deprecated in
favor of GREP_COLORS, but still supported. The mt, ms, and
mc capabilities of GREP_COLORS have priority over it. It can
only specify the color used to highlight the matching
non-empty text in any matching line (a selected line when
the -v command-line option is omitted, or a context line
when -v is specified). The default is 01;31, which means a
bold red foreground text on the terminals default
background.</p>

<p>GREP_COLORS Specifies the colors and other attributes
used to highlight various parts of the output. Its value is
a colon-separated list of capabilities that defaults to
ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 with the
rv and ne boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).
Supported capabilities are as follows.</p>

<p>sl= SGR substring for whole selected lines (i.e.,
matching lines when the -v command-line option is omitted,
or non- matching lines when -v is specified). If however the
boolean rv capability and the -v command-line option are
both specified, it applies to context matching lines
instead. The default is empty (i.e., the terminals default
color pair).</p>

<p>cx= SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e.,
non-matching lines when the -v command-line option is
omitted, or matching lines when -v is specified). If however
the boolean rv capability and the -v command-line option are
both specified, it applies to selected non-matching lines
instead. The default is empty (i.e., the terminals default
color pair).</p>

<p>rv Boolean value that reverses (swaps) the meanings of
the sl= and cx= capabilities when the -v command-line option
is specified. The default is false (i.e., the capability is
omitted).</p>

<p>mt=01;31 SGR substring for matching non-empty text in
any matching line (i.e., a selected line when the -v
command-line option is omitted, or a context line when -v is
specified). Setting this is equivalent to setting both ms=
and mc= at once to the same value. The default is a bold red
text foreground over the current line background.</p>

<p>ms=01;31 SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a
selected line. (This is only used when the -v command-line
option is omitted.) The effect of the sl= (or cx= if rv)
capability remains active when this kicks in. The default is
a bold red text foreground over the current line
background.</p>

<p>mc=01;31 SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a
context line. (This is only used when the -v command-line
option is specified.) The effect of the cx= (or sl= if rv)
capability remains active when this kicks in. The default is
a bold red text foreground over the current line
background.</p>

<p>fn=35 SGR substring for file names prefixing any content
line. The default is a magenta text foreground over the
terminals default background.</p>

<p>ln=32 SGR substring for line numbers prefixing any
content line. The default is a green text foreground over
the terminals default background.</p>

<p>bn=32 SGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any
content line. The default is a green text foreground over
the terminals default background.</p>

<p>se=36 SGR substring for separators that are inserted
between selected line fields (:), between context line
fields, (-), and between groups of adjacent lines when
nonzero context is specified (--). The default is a cyan
text foreground over the terminal s default background.</p>

<p>ne Boolean value that prevents clearing to the end of
line using Erase in Line (EL) to Right 33[K) each time a
colorized item ends. This is needed on terminals on which EL
is not supported. It is otherwise useful on terminals for
which the back_color_erase (bce) boolean terminfo capability
does not apply, when the chosen highlight colors do not
affect the background, or when EL is too slow or causes too
much flicker. The default is false (i.e., the capability is
omitted).</p>

<p>Note that boolean capabilities have no =... part. They
are omitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when
specified.</p>

<p>See the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the
documentation of the text terminal that is used for
permitted values and their meaning as character attributes.
These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons. grep
takes care of assembling the result into a complete SGR
sequence 33[...m). Common values to concatenate include 1
for bold, 4 for underline, 5 for blink, 7 for inverse, 39
for default foreground color, 30 to 37 for foreground
colors, 90 to 97 for 16-color mode foreground colors, 38;5;0
to 38;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground
colors, 49 for default background color, 40 to 47 for
background colors, 100 to 107 for 16-color mode background
colors, and 48;5;0 to 48;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color
modes background colors.</p>

<p>LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LANG These variables specify the
locale for the LC_COLLATE category, which determines the
collating sequence used to interpret range expressions like
[a-z].</p>

<p>LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG These variables specify the
locale for the LC_CTYPE category, which determines the type
of characters, e.g., which characters are whitespace.</p>

<p>LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG These variables specify the
locale for the LC_MESSAGES category, which determines the
language that grep uses for messages. The default C locale
uses American English messages.</p>

<p>POSIXLY_CORRECT If set, grep behaves as POSIX requires;
otherwise, grep behaves more like other GNU programs. POSIX
requires that options that follow file names must be treated
as file names; by default, such options are permuted to the
front of the operand list and are treated as options. Also,
POSIX requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as
illegal, but since they are not really against the law the
default is to diagnose them as invalid. POSIXLY_CORRECT also
disables _N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_, described below.</p>

<p>_N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_ (Here N is greps numeric
process ID.) If the ith character of this environment
variable s value is 1, do not consider the ith operand of
grep to be an option, even if it appears to be one. A shell
can put this variable in the environment for each command it
runs, specifying which operands are the results of file name
wildcard expansion and therefore should not be treated as
options. This behavior is available only with the GNU C
library, and only when POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS Normally, the exit status is 0 if selected
lines are found and 1 otherwise. But the exit status is 2 if
an error occurred, unless the -q or --quiet or --silent
option is used and a selected line is found. Note, however,
that POSIX only mandates, for programs such as grep, cmp,
and diff, that the exit status in case of error be greater
than 1; it is therefore advisable, for the sake of
portability, to use logic that tests for this general
condition instead of strict equality with 2.</p>
