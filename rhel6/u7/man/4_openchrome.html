<p>NAME openchrome - video driver for VIA Unichromes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;openchrome&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION openchrome is an Xorg driver for VIA
chipsets that have an integrated Unichrome graphics
engine.</p>

<p>The openchrome driver supports the following chipsets:
CLE266, KM400/KN400/KM400A/P4M800, CN400/PM800/PN800/PM880,
K8M800, CN700/VM800/P4M800Pro, CX700, P4M890, K8M890,
P4M900/VN896/CN896, VX800, VX855 and VX900. The driver
includes 2D acceleration and Xv video overlay extensions.
Flat panel, TV, and VGA outputs are sup- ported, depending
on the hardware configuration.</p>

<p>3D direct rendering is available using experimental
drivers from Mesa (www.mesa3d.org). There is also an XvMC
client library for hardware acceleration of MPEG1/MPEG2
decoding (not available on the KM/N400) that uses the Direct
Rendering Infrastructure (DRI). The XvMC client library
implements a non-standard &quot;VLD&quot; extension to the
XvMC standard. The current Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)
kernel module is available at dri.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p>The driver supports free modes for Unichrome Pros
(K8M800/K8N800, PM800/PN800, and CN400). For plain
Unichromes (CLE266, KM400/KN400), it currently supports only
a limited number of dotclocks, so if you are using X
modelines you must make sure that the dotclock is one of
those supported. Supported dotclocks on plain Unichromes are
currently (in MHz): 25.2, 25.312, 26.591, 31.5, 31.704,
32.663, 33.750, 35.5, 36.0, 39.822, 40.0, 41.164, 46.981,
49.5, 50.0, 56.3, 57.284, 64.995, 65.0, 65.028, 74.480,
75.0, 78.8, 81.613, 94.5, 108.0, 108.28, 122.0, 122.726,
135.0, 148.5, 155.8, 157.5, 161.793, 162.0, 175.5, 189.0,
202.5, 204.8, 218.3, 229.5. On top of this, bandwidth
restrictions apply for both Unichromes and Unichrome
Pros.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The following driver options are supported:</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot; The
driver supports &quot;XAA&quot; and &quot;EXA&quot;
acceleration methods. The default method is XAA, since EXA
is still experimental. Con- trary to XAA, EXA implements
acceleration for screen uploads and downloads (if DRI is
enabled) and for the Render/Composite extension.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ActiveDevice&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Specifies the active device combination. Any string
containing &quot;CRT&quot;, &quot;LCD&quot;,
&quot;DFP&quot;, &quot;TV&quot; should be possible.
&quot;CRT&quot; represents anything that is connected to the
VGA port, &quot;LCD&quot; is for laptop panels (not TFT
screens attached to the VGA port), &quot;DFP&quot; is for
screens connected to the DVI port, &quot;TV&quot; is
self-explanatory. The default is to use what is detected.
The driver is currently unable to use LCD and TV
simultaneously, and will favour the LCD. The DVI port is not
properly probed and needs to be enabled with this
option.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AGPMem&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Sets the
amount of AGP memory that is allocated at X server startup.
The allocated memory will be &quot;integer&quot; kB. This
AGP memory is used for the AGP command buffer (if the option
&quot;EnableAGPDMA&quot; is set to &quot;true&quot;), for
DRI textures, and for the EXA scratch area. The driver will
allocate at least one system page of AGP memory, or -- if
the AGP command buffer is used -- at least 2 MB plus one
system page. If there is no room for the EXA scratch area in
AGP space, it will be allocated from VRAM. If there is no
room for DRI textures, they will be allocated from the DRI
part of VRAM (see the option &quot;MaxDRIMem&quot;). The
default amount of AGP is 32768 kB. Note that the AGP
aperture set in the BIOS must be able to accommodate the
amount of AGP memory specified here. Otherwise no AGP memory
will be avail- able. It is safe to set a very large AGP
aperture in the BIOS.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Center&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
image centering on DVI displays. The default is dis-
abled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisableIRQ&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disables the vertical blank IRQ. This is a workaround for
some mainboards that have problems with IRQs coming from the
Unichrome engine. With IRQs disabled, DRI clients have no
way to synchronize their drawing to Vblank. (IRQ is disabled
by default on the KM400 and K8M800 chipsets.)</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisableVQ&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disables the use of the virtual command queue. The queue is
enabled by default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EnableAGPDMA&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enables the AGP DMA functionality in DRM. This requires that
DRI is enabled and will force 2D and 3D acceleration to use
AGP DMA. The XvMC DRI client will also make use of this on
the CLE266 to consume much less CPU. (This option is enabled
by default, except on the K8M890 and P4M900.)</p>

<p>Option &quot;ExaNoComposite&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If
EXA is enabled (using the option &quot;AccelMethod&quot;),
this option enables acceleration of compositing. Since EXA,
and in particu- lar its composite acceleration, is still
experimental, this is a way to disable a misbehaving
composite acceleration.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ExaScratchSize&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Sets the size of the EXA scratch area to &quot;integer&quot;
kB. This area is used by EXA as a last place to look for
available space for pixmaps. Too little space will slow
compositing down. This option should be set to the size of
the largest pixmap used. If you have a screen width of over
1024 pixels and use 24 bpp, set this to 8192. Otherwise you
can leave this at the default 4096. The space will be
allocated from AGP memory if available, other- wise from
VRAM.</p>

<p>Option &quot;LCDDualEdge&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enables the use of dual-edge mode to set the LCD. The
default is disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MaxDRIMem&quot; &quot;integer&quot; Sets
the maximum amount of VRAM memory allocated for DRI clients
to &quot;integer&quot; kB. Normally DRI clients get half the
available VRAM size, but in some cases it may make sense to
limit this amount. For example, if you are using a composite
manager and you want to give as much memory as possible to
the EXA pixmap storage area.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MigrationHeuristic&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Sets the heuristic for EXA pixmap migration. This is an EXA
core option, and starting from Xorg server version 1.3.0
this defaults to &quot;always&quot;. The openchrome driver
performs best with &quot;greedy&quot;, so you should really
add this option to your configu- ration file. The third
possibility is &quot;smart&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disables
the use of hardware acceleration. Acceleration is enabled by
default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAGPFor2D&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disables the use of AGP DMA for 2D acceleration, even when
AGP DMA is enabled. The default is enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoXVDMA&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If DRI is
enabled, Xv normally uses PCI DMA to transfer video images
from system to frame-buffer memory. This is somewhat slower
than direct copies due to the limitations of the PCI bus,
but on the other hand it decreases CPU usage significantly,
par- ticularly on computers with fast processors. Some video
players are buggy and will display rendering artifacts when
PCI DMA is used. If you experience this, or dont want your
PCI bus to be stressed with Xv images, set this option to
&quot;true&quot;. This option has no effect when DRI is not
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PanelSize&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Specifies the size (width x height) of the LCD panel
attached to the system. The sizes 640x480, 800x600,
1024x768, 1280x1024, and 1400x1050 are supported.</p>

<p>Option &quot;RotationType&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Enabled rotation by using RandR. The driver only support
unac- celerated RandR rotations &quot;SWRandR&quot;.
Hardware rotations &quot;HWRandR&quot; is currently
unimplemented.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;string&quot; Rotates the
display either clockwise (&quot;CW&quot;), counterclockwise
(&quot;CCW&quot;) and upside-down (&quot;UD&quot;). Rotation
is only supported unac- celerated. Adding option
&quot;Rotate&quot;, enables RandR rotation fea- ture. The
RandR allows clients to dynamically change X screens.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ShadowFB&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
the use of a shadow frame buffer. This is required when
rotating the display, but otherwise defaults to
disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
the use of a software cursor. The default is disabled: the
hardware cursor is used.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVDeflicker&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Specifies the deflicker setting for TV output. Valid values
are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;2&quot;. Here 0
means no deflicker, 1 means 1:1:1 deflicker, and 2 means
1:2:1 deflicker.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVDotCrawl&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enables dot-crawl suppression. The default is disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVOutput&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specifies
which TV output to use. The driver supports &quot;S-
Video&quot;, &quot;Composite&quot;, &quot;SC&quot;,
&quot;RGB&quot;, and &quot;YCbCr&quot; outputs. Note that on
some EPIA boards the composite-video port is shared with
audio-out and is selected via a jumper.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVPort&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specifies
TV port. The driver currently supports &quot;DVP0&quot;,
&quot;DVP1&quot;, &quot;DFPHigh&quot; and &quot;DFPLow&quot;
ports.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TVType&quot; &quot;string&quot; Specifies
TV output format. The driver currently supports
&quot;NTSC&quot; and &quot;PAL&quot; timings only.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VBEModes&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enables
the use of VBE BIOS calls for setting the display mode. This
mimics the behaviour of the vesa driver but still provides
acceleration and other features. This option may be used if
your hardware works with the vesa driver but not with the
openchrome driver. It may not work on 64-bit systems. Using
&quot;VBEModes&quot; may speed up driver acceleration
significantly due to a more aggressive hardware setting,
particularly on systems with low memory bandwidth. Your
refresh rate may be limited to 60 Hz on some systems.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VBESaveRestore&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enables the use of VBE BIOS calls for saving and restoring
the display state when the X server is launched. This can be
extremely slow on some hardware, and the system may appear
to have locked for 10 seconds or so. The default is to use
the driver builtin function. This option only works if
option &quot;VBE- Modes&quot; is enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoRAM&quot; &quot;integer&quot;
Overrides the VideoRAM autodetection. This should never be
needed.</p>

<p>TV ENCODERS Unichromes tend to be paired with several
different TV encoders.</p>

<p>VIA Technologies VT1621 Still untested, as no
combination with a Unichrome is known or available. Supports
the following normal modes: &quot;640x480&quot; and
&quot;800x600&quot;. Use &quot;640x480Over&quot; and
&quot;800x600Over&quot; for vertical overscan. These modes
are made available by the driver; mode- lines provided in
xorg.conf will be ignored.</p>

<p>VIA Technologies VT1622, VT1622A, VT1623 Supports the
following modes: &quot;640x480&quot;, &quot;800x600&quot;,
&quot;1024x768&quot;, &quot;848x480&quot;,
&quot;720x480&quot; (NTSC only) and &quot;720x576&quot; (PAL
only). Use &quot;640x480Over&quot;, &quot;800x600Over&quot;,
&quot;1024x768Over&quot;, &quot;848x480Over&quot;,
&quot;720x480Over&quot; (NTSC) and &quot;720x576Over&quot;
(PAL) for vertical over- scan. The modes
&quot;720x480Noscale&quot; (NTSC) and
&quot;720x576Noscale&quot; (PAL) (available on VT1622 only)
provide cleaner TV output (unscaled with only minimal
overscan). These modes are made available by the driver;
modelines provided in xorg.conf will be ignored.</p>
