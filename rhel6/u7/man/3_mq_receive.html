<p>MQ_RECEIVE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
MQ_RECEIVE(3)</p>

<p>NAME mq_receive, mq_timedreceive - receive a message
from a message queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t mq_receive(mqd_t mqdes, char *msg_ptr, size_t
msg_len, unsigned *msg_prio);</p>

<p>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600 #include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t mq_timedreceive(mqd_t mqdes, char *msg_ptr,
size_t msg_len, unsigned *msg_prio, const struct timespec
*abs_timeout);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION mq_receive() removes the oldest message with
the highest priority from the message queue referred to by
the descriptor mqdes, and places it in the buffer pointed to
by msg_ptr. The msg_len argument specifies the size of the
buffer pointed to by msg_ptr; this must be greater than the
mq_msgsize attribute of the queue (see mq_getattr(3)). If
prio is not NULL, then the buffer to which it points is used
to return the priority associated with the received
message.</p>

<p>If the queue is empty, then, by default, mq_receive()
blocks until a message becomes available, or the call is
interrupted by a signal han- dler. If the O_NONBLOCK flag is
enabled for the message queue descrip- tion, then the call
instead fails immediately with the error EAGAIN.</p>

<p>mq_timedreceive() behaves just like mq_receive(), except
that if the queue is empty and the O_NONBLOCK flag is not
enabled for the message queue description, then abs_timeout
points to a structure which speci- fies a ceiling on the
time for which the call will block. This ceiling is an
absolute timeout in seconds and nanoseconds since the Epoch
(mid- night on the morning of 1 January 1970), specified in
the following structure:</p>

<p>struct timespec { time_t tv_sec; /* seconds */ long
tv_nsec; /* nanoseconds */ };</p>

<p>If no message is available, and the timeout has already
expired by the time of the call, mq_timedreceive() returns
immediately.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, mq_receive() and
mq_timedreceive() return the number of bytes in the received
message; on error, -1 is returned, with errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The queue was empty, and the O_NONBLOCK
flag was set for the message queue description referred to
by mqdes.</p>

<p>EBADF The descriptor specified in mqdes was invalid.</p>

<p>EINTR The call was interrupted by a signal handler; see
signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL The call would have blocked, and abs_timeout was
invalid, either because tv_sec was less than zero, or
because tv_nsec was less than zero or greater than 1000
million.</p>

<p>EMSGSIZE msg_len was less than the mq_msgsize attribute
of the message queue.</p>

<p>ETIMEDOUT The call timed out before a message could be
transferred.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES On Linux, mq_timedreceive() is a system call, and
mq_receive() is a library function layered on top of that
system call.</p>
