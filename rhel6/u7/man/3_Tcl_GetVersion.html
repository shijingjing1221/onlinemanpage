<p>ARGUMENTS int *major (out) Major version number of the
Tcl library.</p>

<p>int *minor (out) Minor version number of the Tcl
library.</p>

<p>int *patchLevel (out) The patch level of the Tcl library
(or alpha or beta number).</p>

_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_GetVersion should be used to query the
version number of the Tcl library at runtime. This is useful
when using a dynamically loaded Tcl library or when writing
a stubs-aware extension. For instance, if you write an
extension that is linked against the Tcl stubs library, it
could be loaded into a program linked to an older version of
Tcl than you expected. Use Tcl_GetVersion to verify that
fact, and possibly to change the behavior of your
extension.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetVersion accepts NULL for any of the arguments.
For instance if you do not care about the patchLevel of the
library, pass a NULL for the patchLevel argument.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS version, patchlevel, major, minor, alpha, beta,
release</p>
