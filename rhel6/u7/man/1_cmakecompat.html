<p>NAME cmakecompat - Reference of CMake compatibility
commands.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS CMake Compatibility Listfile
Commands - Obsolete commands supported by CMake for
compatibility.</p>

<p>This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile
commands from pre- vious CMake versions, which are still
supported for compatibility rea- sons. You should instead
use the newer, faster and shinier new com- mands. ;-)</p>

<p>build_name Deprecated. Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and
${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.</p>

<p>build_name(variable)</p>

<p>Sets the specified variable to a string representing the
plat- form and compiler settings. These values are now
available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
variables.</p>

<p>exec_program Deprecated. Use the execute_process()
command instead.</p>

<p>Run an executable program during the processing of the
CMake- List.txt file.</p>

<p>exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
[ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;] [OUTPUT_VARIABLE
&lt;var&gt;] [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])</p>

<p>The executable is run in the optionally specified
directory. The executable can include arguments if it is
double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS
argument to specify argu- ments to the program. This is
because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the
executable path. An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE
specifies a variable in which to store the out- put. To
capture the return value of the execution, provide a
RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no
output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running
cmake.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies Deprecated. Use
INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.</p>

<p>This command generates an old-style library dependencies
file. Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use
the com- mand. Use instead the install(EXPORT) command to
help export targets from an installation tree and the
export() command to export targets from a build tree.</p>

<p>The old-style library dependencies file does not take
into account per-configuration names of libraries or the
LINK_INTER- FACE_LIBRARIES target property.</p>

<p>export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])</p>

<p>Create a file named &lt;file&gt; that can be included
into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command. The file
will contain a num- ber of SET commands that will set all
the variables needed for library dependency information.
This should be the last command in the top level
CMakeLists.txt file of the project. If the APPEND option is
specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given
file instead of replacing it.</p>

<p>install_files Deprecated. Use the install(FILES )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the FILES form of the
install com- mand. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the file command.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed files with the given
exten- sion into the given directory. Only files existing in
the cur- rent source tree or its corresponding location in
the binary tree may be listed. If a file specified already
has an exten- sion, that extension will be removed first.
This is useful for providing lists of source files such as
foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be
installed. A typical extension is .h.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>Any files in the current source directory that match the
regular expression will be installed.</p>

<p>install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)</p>

<p>Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be
installed explicitly from the names given. Full paths are
allowed in this form.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_programs Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code. The
FILES form is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the
INSTALL command. The regexp form can be expressed more
clearly using the GLOB form of the FILE command.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed programs into the
given directory. Use the FILES argument to guarantee that
the file list version of the command will be used even when
there is only one argument.</p>

<p>install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)</p>

<p>In the second form any program in the current source
directory that matches the regular expression will be
installed.</p>

<p>This command is intended to install programs that are
not built by cmake, such as shell scripts. See the TARGETS
form of the INSTALL command to create installation rules for
targets built by cmake.</p>

<p>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the
installation prefix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</p>

<p>install_targets Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )
command instead.</p>

<p>This command has been superceded by the install command.
It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.</p>

<p>install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir]
target target)</p>

<p>Create rules to install the listed targets into the
given direc- tory. The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to
the installation pre- fix, which is stored in the variable
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If RUNTIME_DIRECTORY is specified,
then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL),
the files will be copied to that directory.</p>

<p>link_libraries Deprecated. Use the
target_link_libraries() command instead.</p>

<p>Link libraries to all targets added later.</p>

<p>link_libraries(library1 &lt;debug | optimized&gt;
library2 ...)</p>

<p>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any
following tar- gets (typically added with the add_executable
or add_library calls). This command is passed down to all
subdirectories. The debug and optimized strings may be used
to indicate that the next library listed is to be used only
for that specific type of build.</p>

<p>make_directory Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY )
command instead.</p>

<p>make_directory(directory)</p>

<p>Creates the specified directory. Full paths should be
given. Any parent directories that do not exist will also be
created. Use with care.</p>

<p>output_required_files Deprecated. Approximate C
preprocessor dependency scanning.</p>

<p>This command exists only because ancient CMake versions
provided it. CMake handles preprocessor dependency scanning
automati- cally using a more advanced scanner.</p>

<p>output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)</p>

<p>Outputs a list of all the source files that are required
by the specified srcfile. This list is written into
outputfile. This is similar to writing out the dependencies
for srcfile except that it jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c
and .cpp files if possible.</p>

<p>remove Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command
instead.</p>

<p>remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)</p>

<p>Removes VALUE from the variable VAR. This is typically
used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon
separated list). VALUE is expanded.</p>

<p>subdir_depends Deprecated. Does nothing.</p>

<p>subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)</p>

<p>Does not do anything. This command used to help projects
order parallel builds correctly. This functionality is now
automatic.</p>

<p>subdirs Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command
instead.</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build.</p>

<p>subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1
exclude_dir2 ...] [PREORDER] )</p>

<p>Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The
add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs
although subdirs will still work. This will cause any
CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed
by CMake. Any directories after the PREORDER flag are
traversed first by makefile builds, the PRE- ORDER flag has
no effect on IDE projects. Any directories after the
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top
level makefile or project file. This is useful for having
CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in
a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or
project files for all the examples at the same time, but you
would not want them to show up in the top level project or
be built each time make is run from the top.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa Copy mesa headers for use in
combination with system GL.</p>

<p>use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)</p>

<p>The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.
The mesa headers are copied to the specified output
directory. This allows mangled mesa headers to override
other GL headers by being added to the include directory
path earlier.</p>

<p>utility_source Specify the source tree of a third-party
utility.</p>

<p>utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])</p>

<p>When a third-party utilitys source is included in the
distribu- tion, this command specifies its location and
name. The cache entry will not be set unless the
path_to_source and all listed files exist. It is assumed
that the source tree of the utility will have been built
before it is needed.</p>

<p>When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a
util- ity_source() command is executed, because in many
cases it is used to build an executable which is executed
later on. This doesn t work when cross compiling, since the
executable can run only on their target platform. So in this
case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it
points to an executable which is runnable on the build
host.</p>

<p>variable_requires Deprecated. Use the if() command
instead.</p>

<p>Assert satisfaction of an option s required
variables.</p>

<p>variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
REQUIRED_VARIABLE1 REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)</p>

<p>The first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the
variable to be tested, if that variable is false nothing
else is done. If TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next
argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is a variable that is set to true
if all the required variables are set. The rest of the
arguments are variables that must be true or not set to
NOTFOUND to avoid an error. If any are not true, an error is
reported.</p>

<p>write_file Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command
instead.</p>

<p>write_file(filename &quot;message to write&quot;...
[APPEND])</p>

<p>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the
arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is
specified, then the message will be appended.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot
be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file
...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use
configure_file if you want to generate input files to
CMake.</p>
