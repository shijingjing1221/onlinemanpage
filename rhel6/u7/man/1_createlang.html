<p>NAME createlang - define a new PostgreSQL procedural
language</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS createlang [ connection-option... ] langname [
dbname ]</p>

<p>createlang [ connection-option... ] [ --list ] [ -l ]
dbname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION createlang is a utility for adding a new
programming language to a PostgreSQL database. createlang is
just a wrapper around the CREATE LANGUAGE
[create_language(7)] command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS createlang accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>langname Specifies the name of the procedural
programming language to be defined.</p>

<p>[-d] dbname</p>

<p>[--dbname] dbname Specifies to which database the
language should be added. The default is to use the database
with the same name as the current system user.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Display SQL commands as they are executed.</p>

<p>-l</p>

<p>--list Show a list of already installed languages in the
target database.</p>

<p>createlang also accepts the following command-line
arguments for con- nection parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain
socket file exten- sion on which the server is listening for
connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--no-password Never issue a password prompt. If the
server requires password authentication and a password is
not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force createlang to prompt for a password
before connecting to a database.</p>

<p>This option is never essential, since createlang will
automati- cally prompt for a password if the server demands
password authentication. However, createlang will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATABASE</p>

<p>PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the envi- ronment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Most error messages are self-explanatory. If
not, run createlang with the --echo option and see under the
respective SQL command for details. Also, any default
connection settings and environment variables used by the
libpq front-end library will apply.</p>

<p>NOTES Use droplang(1) to remove a language.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To install the language pltcl into the database
template1:</p>

<p>$ createlang pltcl template1</p>

<p>Note that installing the language into template1 will
cause it to be automatically installed into
subsequently-created databases as well.</p>
