<p>TDELETE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TDELETE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tdelete, tfind, tsearch, twalk - manage a binary
search tree</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;search.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *tdelete(const void *restrict key, void **restrict
rootp, int(*compar)(const void *, const void *)); void
*tfind(const void *key, void *const *rootp,
int(*compar)(const void *, const void *)); void
*tsearch(const void *key, void **rootp, int (*compar)(const
void *, const void *)); void twalk(const void *root, void
(*action)(const void *, VISIT, int));</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tdelete(), tfind(), tsearch(), and
twalk() functions manipulate binary search trees.
Comparisons are made with a user-supplied routine, the
address of which is passed as the compar argument. This
routine is called with two arguments, which are the pointers
to the elements being compared. The application shall ensure
that the user-supplied routine returns an integer less than,
equal to, or greater than 0, according to whether the first
argument is to be considered less than, equal to, or greater
than the second argument. The comparison function need not
com- pare every byte, so arbitrary data may be contained in
the elements in addition to the values being compared.</p>

<p>The tsearch() function shall build and access the tree.
The key argu- ment is a pointer to an element to be accessed
or stored. If there is a node in the tree whose element is
equal to the value pointed to by key, a pointer to this
found node shall be returned. Otherwise, the value pointed
to by key shall be inserted (that is, a new node is created
and the value of key is copied to this node), and a pointer
to this node returned. Only pointers are copied, so the
application shall ensure that the calling routine stores the
data. The rootp argument points to a variable that points to
the root node of the tree. A null pointer value for the
variable pointed to by rootp denotes an empty tree; in this
case, the variable shall be set to point to the node which
shall be at the root of the new tree.</p>

<p>Like tsearch(), tfind() shall search for a node in the
tree, returning a pointer to it if found. However, if it is
not found, tfind() shall return a null pointer. The
arguments for tfind() are the same as for tsearch().</p>

<p>The tdelete() function shall delete a node from a binary
search tree. The arguments are the same as for tsearch().
The variable pointed to by rootp shall be changed if the
deleted node was the root of the tree. The tdelete()
function shall return a pointer to the parent of the deleted
node, or a null pointer if the node is not found.</p>

<p>The twalk() function shall traverse a binary search
tree. The root argument is a pointer to the root node of the
tree to be traversed. (Any node in a tree may be used as the
root for a walk below that node.) The argument action is the
name of a routine to be invoked at each node. This routine
is, in turn, called with three arguments. The first argument
shall be the address of the node being visited. The
structure pointed to by this argument is unspecified and
shall not be modified by the application, but it shall be
possible to cast a pointer-to-node into a
pointer-to-pointer-to-element to access the ele- ment stored
in the node. The second argument shall be a value from an
enumeration data type:</p>

<p>typedef enum { preorder, postorder, endorder, leaf }
VISIT;</p>

<p>(defined in &lt;search.h&gt;), depending on whether this
is the first, sec- ond, or third time that the node is
visited (during a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of
the tree), or whether the node is a leaf. The third argument
shall be the level of the node in the tree, with the root
being level 0.</p>

<p>If the calling function alters the pointer to the root,
the result is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the node is found, both tsearch() and
tfind() shall return a pointer to it. If not, tfind() shall
return a null pointer, and tsearch() shall return a pointer
to the inserted item.</p>

<p>A null pointer shall be returned by tsearch() if there
is not enough space available to create a new node.</p>

<p>A null pointer shall be returned by tdelete(), tfind(),
and tsearch() if rootp is a null pointer on entry.</p>

<p>The tdelete() function shall return a pointer to the
parent of the deleted node, or a null pointer if the node is
not found.</p>

<p>The twalk() function shall not return a value.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following code reads in strings and stores
structures containing a pointer to each string and a count
of its length. It then walks the tree, printing out the
stored strings and their lengths in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>#include &lt;search.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>#define STRSZ 10000 #define NODSZ 500</p>

<p>struct node { /* Pointers to these are stored in the
tree. */ char *string; int length; };</p>

<p>char string_space[STRSZ]; /* Space to store strings. */
struct node nodes[NODSZ]; /* Nodes to store. */ void *root =
NULL; /* This points to the root. */</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { char *strptr =
string_space; struct node *nodeptr = nodes; void
print_node(const void *, VISIT, int); int i = 0,
node_compare(const void *, const void *);</p>

<p>while (gets(strptr) != NULL &amp;&amp; i++ &lt; NODSZ) {
/* Set node. */ nodeptr-&gt;string = strptr;
nodeptr-&gt;length = strlen(strptr); /* Put node into the
tree. */ (void) tsearch((void *)nodeptr, (void **)&amp;root,
node_compare); /* Adjust pointers, so we do not overwrite
tree. */ strptr += nodeptr-&gt;length + 1; nodeptr++; }
twalk(root, print_node); return 0; }</p>

<p>/* * This routine compares two nodes, based on an *
alphabetical ordering of the string field. */ int
node_compare(const void *node1, const void *node2) { return
strcmp(((const struct node *) node1)-&gt;string, ((const
struct node *) node2)-&gt;string); }</p>

<p>/* * This routine prints out a node, the second time *
twalk encounters it or if it is a leaf. */ void
print_node(const void *ptr, VISIT order, int level) { const
struct node *p = *(const struct node **) ptr;</p>

<p>if (order == postorder || order == leaf) { (void)
printf(&quot;string = %s, length = %n&quot;, p-&gt;string,
p-&gt;length); } }</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The root argument to twalk() is one
level of indirection less than the rootp arguments to
tdelete() and tsearch().</p>

<p>There are two nomenclatures used to refer to the order
in which tree nodes are visited. The tsearch() function uses
preorder, postorder, and endorder to refer respectively to
visiting a node before any of its children, after its left
child and before its right, and after both its children. The
alternative nomenclature uses preorder, inorder, and
postorder to refer to the same visits, which could result in
some con- fusion over the meaning of postorder.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
