<p>SG_RBUF(8) SG3_UTILS SG_RBUF(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_rbuf - reads data using SCSI READ BUFFER
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_rbuf [--buffer=EACH] [--dio] [--help]
[--mmap] [--quick] [--size=OVERALL] [--test] [--verbose]
[--version] DEVICE</p>

<p>sg_rbuf [-b=EACH_KIB] [-d] [-m] [-q] [-s=OVERALL_MIB]
[-t] [-v] [-V] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command reads data with the SCSI READ
BUFFER command and then dis- cards it. Typically the data
being read is from a disks memory cache. It is assumed that
the data is sourced quickly (although this is not guaranteed
by the SCSI standards) so that it is faster than reading
data from the media. This command is designed for timing
transfer speeds across a SCSI transport.</p>

<p>To fetch the data with a SCSI READ BUFFER command and
optionally decode it see the sg_read_buffer utility. There
is also a sg_write_buffer utility useful for downloading
firmware amongst other things.</p>

<p>This utility supports two command line syntaxes, the
preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and explained
in this section. A later sec- tion on the old command line
syntax outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-b, --buffer=EACH where EACH is the number of bytes to
be transferred by each READ BUFFER command. The default is
the actual available buffer size returned by the READ BUFFER
(descriptor) command. The maximum is the same as the
default, hence this argument can only be used to reduce the
size of each transfer to less than the devices actual
available buffer size.</p>

<p>-d, --dio use direct IO if available. This option is
only available if the DEVICE is a sg driver device node
(e.g. /dev/sg1). In this case the sg driver will attempt to
configure the DMA from the SCSI adapter to transfer directly
into user memory. This will elimi- nate the copy via kernel
buffers. If not available then this will be reported and
indirect IO will be done instead.</p>

<p>-h, --help print usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-m, --mmap use memory mapped IO if available. This
option is only available if the DEVICE is a sg driver device
node (e.g. /dev/sg1). In this case the sg driver will
attempt to configure the DMA from the SCSI adapter to
transfer directly into user memory. This will eliminate the
copy via kernel buffers.</p>

<p>-O, --old switch to older style options.</p>

<p>-q, --quick only transfer the data into kernel buffers
(typically by DMA from the SCSI adapter card) and do not
move it into the user space. This option is only available
if the DEVICE is a sg driver device node (e.g.
/dev/sg1).</p>

<p>-s, --size=OVERALL where OVERALL is the size of total
transfer in bytes. The default is 200 MiB (200*1024*1024
bytes). The actual number of bytes transferred may be
slightly less than requested since all transfers are the
same size (and an integer division is involved rounding
towards zero).</p>

<p>-t, --time times the bulk data transfer component of
this command. The elapsed time is printed out plus a MB/sec
calculation. In this case &quot;MB&quot; is 1,000,000 bytes.
The gettimeofday() system call is used internally for the
time calculation.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase level of verbosity. Can be used
multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>NOTES This command is typically used on modern SCSI
disks which have a RAM cache in their drive electronics. If
no IO to the magnetic media, or slower devices like flash
RAM, is involved then the disk may be able to source data
fast enough to saturate the bandwidth of the SCSI trans-
port. The bottleneck may then be the DMA element in the HBA,
the Linux drivers or the host machines hardware (e.g. speed
of RAM).</p>

<p>Various numeric arguments (e.g. OVERALL) may include
multiplicative suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the
&quot;NUMERIC ARGUMENTS&quot; sec- tion in the sg3_utils(8)
man page.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES On the test system /dev/sg0 corresponds to a
fast disk on a U2W SCSI bus (max 80 MB/sec). The disk
specifications state that its cache is 4 MB. $ time
./sg_rbuf /dev/sg0 READ BUFFER reports: buffer
capacity=3434944, offset boundary=6 Read 200 MiB (actual 199
MiB, 209531584 bytes), buffer size=3354 KiB real 0m5.072s,
user 0m0.000s, sys 0m2.280s</p>

<p>So that is approximately 40 MB/sec at 40 % utilization.
Now with the addition of the &quot;-q&quot; option this
throughput improves and the utiliza- tion drops to 0%. $
time ./sg_rbuf -q /dev/sg0 READ BUFFER reports: buffer
capacity=3434944, offset boundary=6 Read 200 MiB (actual 199
MiB, 209531584 bytes), buffer size=3354 KiB real 0m2.784s,
user 0m0.000s, sys 0m0.000s</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_rbuf is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The options in this section
were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23
. In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options
can be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS
environment variable or using --old (or -O) as the first
option.</p>

<p>-b=EACH_KIB where EACH_KIB is the number of Kilobytes
(i.e. 1024 byte units) to be transferred by each READ BUFFER
command. Similar to the --buffer=EACH option in the main
description but the units are different.</p>

<p>-d use direct IO if available. Equivalent to the --dio
option in the main description.</p>

<p>-m use memory mapped IO if available. Equivalent to the
--mmap option in the main description.</p>

<p>-N switch to the newer style options.</p>

<p>-q only transfer the data into kernel buffers (typically
by DMA from the SCSI adapter card) and do not move it into
the user space. Equivalent to the --quick option in the main
descrip- tion.</p>

<p>-s=OVERALL_MIB where OVERALL_MIB is the size of total
transfer in Megabytes (1048576 bytes). Similar to the
--size=OVERALL option in the main description but the units
are different.</p>

<p>-t times the bulk data transfer component of this
command. Equiva- lent to the --time option in the main
description.</p>

<p>-v increase level of verbosity. Can be used multiple
times.</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit.</p>
