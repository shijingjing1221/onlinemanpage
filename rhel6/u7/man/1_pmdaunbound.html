<p>NAME pmdaunbound - Unbound resolver PMDA</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaunbound is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values about the Unbound
DNS resolver using the unbound-con- trol(8) stats_noreset
command.</p>

<p>This gives lots of insight into query types, response
time, cache hits/misses, etc. Please see the
unbound-control(8) man page for expla- nation about each
statistics counter.</p>

<p>Further details on the Unbound DNS resolver can be found
at https://unbound.net/</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Install the Unbound PMDA by using the
Install script as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/unbound # ./Install</p>

<p>To uninstall, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/unbound # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdaunbound is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/unbound/Install installation script
for the pmdaunbound agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/unbound/Remove undo installation script
for the pmdaunbound agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/unbound.log default log file for error
messages from pmdaunbound</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
