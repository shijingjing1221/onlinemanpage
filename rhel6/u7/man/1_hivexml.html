<p>hivexml(1) Windows Registry hivexml(1)</p>

<p>NAME hivexml - Convert Windows Registry binary
&quot;hive&quot; into XML</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hivexml [-dk] hivefile &gt; output.xml</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program converts a single Windows
Registry binary &quot;hive&quot; file into a self-describing
XML format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Enable lots of debug messages. If you find a
Registry file that this program cannot parse, please enable
this option and post the complete output and the Registry
file in your bug report.</p>

<p>-k Keep going even if we find errors in the Registry
file. This skips over any parts of the Registry that we
cannot read.</p>
