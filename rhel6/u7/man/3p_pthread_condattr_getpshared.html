<p>PTHREAD_CONDATTR_GETPSHAREDPOSIX Programmer s
MPTHREAD_CONDATTR_GETPSHARED(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_condattr_getpshared,
pthread_condattr_setpshared - get and set the process-shared
condition variable attributes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_condattr_getpshared(const pthread_condattr_t
*restrict attr, int *restrict pshared); int
pthread_condattr_setpshared(pthread_condattr_t *attr, int
pshared);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_condattr_getpshared() function
shall obtain the value of the process-shared attribute from
the attributes object referenced by attr. The
pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall set the
process- shared attribute in an initialized attributes
object referenced by attr.</p>

<p>The process-shared attribute is set to
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a condition variable to be
operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory
where the condition variable is allocated, even if the
condition variable is allocated in memory that is shared by
multiple processes. If the process-shared attribute is
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the condition variable shall only
be operated upon by threads created within the same process
as the thread that initialized the condition variable; if
threads of differing processes attempt to operate on such a
condition variable, the behavior is undefined. The default
value of the attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the
pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>If successful, the pthread_condattr_getpshared()
function shall return zero and store the value of the
process-shared attribute of attr into the object referenced
by the pshared parameter. Otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_condattr_getpshared() and
pthread_condattr_setpshared() functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The new value specified for the attribute is
outside the range of legal values for that attribute.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>
