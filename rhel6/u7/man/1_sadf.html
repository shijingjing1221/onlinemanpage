<p>NAME sadf - Display data collected by sar in multiple
formats.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sadf [ -d | -D | -H | -p | -x ] [ -h ] [ -t ] [
-V ] [ -P { cpu [,...] | ALL } ] [ -s [ hh:mm:ss ] ] [ -e [
hh:mm:ss ] ] [ -- sar_options ] [ interval [ count ] ] [
datafile ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sadf command is used for displaying the
contents of data files cre- ated by the sar(1) command. But
unlike sar, sadf can write its data in many different
formats (CSV, XML, etc.) The default format is one that can
easily be handled by pattern processing commands like awk
(see option -p).</p>

<p>The sadf command extracts and writes to standard output
records saved in the datafile file. This file must have been
created by a version of sar which is compatible with that of
sadf. If datafile is omitted, sadf uses the standard system
activity file, the /var/log/sa/sadd file, where the dd
parameter indicates the current day.</p>

<p>The interval and count parameters are used to tell sadf
to select count records at interval seconds apart. If the
count parameter is not set, then all the records saved in
the data file will be displayed.</p>

<p>All the activity flags of sar may be entered on the
command line to indicate which activities are to be
reported. Before specifying them, put a pair of dashes (--)
on the command line in order not to confuse the flags with
those of sadf. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU
activity.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D This option is equivalent to option -d below,
except that the timestamp is always expressed in seconds
since the epoch (00:00:00 UTC 01/01/1970).</p>

<p>-d Print the contents of the data file in a format that
can easily be ingested by a relational database system. The
output consists of fields separated by a semicolon. Each
record contains the hostname of the host where the file was
created, the interval value (or -1 if not applicable), the
timestamp in a form easily acceptable by most databases, and
additional semicolon separated data fields as specified by
sar_options command line options. Note that the timestamp is
displayed in UTC (Coordinated Univer- sal Time) unless
option -t is used. In this latter case, the timestamp is
displayed in local time.</p>

<p>-e [ hh:mm:ss ] Set the ending time of the report, given
in local time. The default ending time is 18:00:00. Hours
must be given in 24-hour format. This option is ignored when
option -x is used.</p>

<p>-h When used in conjunction with option -d or -D, all
activities will be displayed horizontally on a single
line.</p>

<p>-H Display the header of the data file.</p>

<p>-P { cpu [,...] | ALL } Tell sadf that processor
dependent statistics are to be reported only for the
specified processor or processors. Specifying the ALL
keyword reports statistics for each individual processor,
and globally for all processors. Note that processor 0 is
the first processor.</p>

<p>-p Print the contents of the data file in a format that
can easily be handled by pattern processing commands like
awk. The output consists of fields separated by a tab. Each
record contains the hostname of the host where the file was
created, the interval value (or -1 if not applicable), the
timestamp (UTC value - Coordinated Universal Time) in
seconds from the epoch, the device name (or - if not
applicable), the field name and its value.</p>

<p>-s [ hh:mm:ss ] Set the starting time of the data (given
in local time), causing the sadf command to extract records
time-tagged at, or follow- ing, the time specified. The
default starting time is 08:00:00. Hours must be given in
24-hour format. This option is ignored when option -x is
used.</p>

<p>-t When this option is used together with options -d or
-x, the timestamp is displayed in local time instead of UTC
(Coordinated Universal Time). This option is ignored when
options -p or -D are used.</p>

<p>-V Print version number then exit.</p>

<p>-x Print the contents of the data file in XML format.
Timestamps are displayed in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
unless option -t is used, in which case they are displayed
in local time. The corresponding DTD (Document Type
Definition) and XML Schema are included in the sysstat
source package. They are also available at
http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard/download.html</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The sadf command takes into account the
following environment variable:</p>

<p>S_TIME_DEF_TIME If this variable exists and its value is
UTC then sadf will use UTC time instead of local time to
determine the current daily data file located in the
/var/log/sa directory.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES sadf -d /var/log/sa/sa21 -- -r -n DEV Extract
memory, swap space and network statistics from system
activity file sa21, and display them in a format that can be
ingested by a database.</p>

<p>sadf -p -P 1 Extract CPU statistics for processor 1 (the
second processor) from current daily data file, and display
them in a format that can easily be handled by a pattern
processing command.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/sa/sadd Indicate the daily data file,
where the dd parameter is a number representing the day of
the month.</p>
