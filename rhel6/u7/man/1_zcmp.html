<p>ZDIFF(1) ZDIFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME zcmp, zdiff - compare compressed files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS zcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ] zdiff [
diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Zcmp and zdiff are used to invoke the cmp or
the diff program on files compressed via gzip. All options
specified are passed directly to cmp or diff. If only 1 file
is specified, then the files compared are file1 and an
uncompressed file1.gz. If two files are specified, then they
are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp or diff. The
exit status from cmp or diff is preserved.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cmp(1), diff(1), zmore(1), zgrep(1), znew(1),
zforce(1), gzip(1), gzexe(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Messages from the cmp or diff programs refer to
temporary filenames instead of those specified.</p>
