<p>NAME pmclient - a simple performance metrics client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmclient [-a archive] [-h host] [-n pmnsfile]
[-p] [-S numsec] [-s sam- ples] [-t interval] [-Z timezone]
[-z]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmclient is a simple client that uses the
Performance Metrics Applica- tion Programming Interface
(PMAPI) to report some high-level system performance
metrics.</p>

<p>The real value of pmclient is as a sample client using
the PMAPI(3), interfaces and to this end the source code is
included with the Perfor- mance Co-Pilot (PCP) package (see
PCPIntro(1)), and is typically installed in
/usr/share/pcp/demos/pmclient.</p>

<p>Normally pmclient operates on the distributed
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n
option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from
the file pmnsfile.</p>

<p>Unless directed to another host by the -h option, or to
an archive by the -a option, pmclient will contact the
Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local
host to obtain the required information. The -a and -h
options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>By default, pmclient reports the time of day according
to the local timezone on the system where pmclient is run.
The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(5).
The -z option changes the timezone to the local timezone at
the host that is the source of the performance met- rics, as
identified via either the -h or -a options.</p>

<p>Other options control the specific information to be
reported.</p>

<p>-p The default behavior for replaying an archive, is to
replay at full speed. The -p option may be used in
conjunction with an archive, to request that the prevailing
real-time delay be applied between samples (see -t) to
effect a pause.</p>

<p>-S numsec The -S option may be used in conjunction with
an archive to request that display start at the time numsec
seconds from the start of the archive.</p>

<p>-s samples The argument samples defines the number of
samples to be retrieved and reported. If samples is 0 or -s
is not specified, pmclient will sample and report
continuously (in real time mode) or until the end of the PCP
archive (in archive mode).</p>

<p>-t interval The default update interval may be set to
something other than the default 5 seconds. The interval
argument follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1), and in
the simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied
units in this case are seconds).</p>

<p>The output from pmclient is directed to standard output,
and lists</p>

<p>+ Aggregate CPU utilization, in the range 0 to 1.</p>

<p>+ If the system has more than 1 CPU, the ordinal number
of the busiest CPU, in the range 0 to ...</p>

<p>+ If the system has more than 1 CPU, the CPU utilization
for the busi- est CPU.</p>

<p>+ Real free memory in Mbytes.</p>

<p>+ Aggregate physical disk I/O operations per second
(IOPS).</p>

<p>+ Load average over the last 1 minute and over the last
15 minutes.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/pmclient source code,
documentation, configuration files and Makefile when the PCP
development package is installed</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO PCPIntro(1), pmcd(1), pmchart(1), pmgenmap(1),
pmstat(1), PMAPI(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All are generated on standard error, and are
intended to be self- explanatory.</p>
