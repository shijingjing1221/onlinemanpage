<p>NAME perf-list - List all symbolic event types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf list
[hw|sw|cache|tracepoint|pmu|event_glob]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command displays the symbolic event
types which can be selected in the various perf commands
with the -e option.</p>

<p>EVENT MODIFIERS Events can optionally have a modifer by
appending a colon and one or more modifiers. Modifiers allow
the user to restrict the events to be counted. The following
modifiers exist:</p>

<p>u - user-space counting k - kernel counting h -
hypervisor counting G - guest counting (in KVM guests) H -
host counting (not in KVM guests) p - precise level S - read
sample value (PERF_SAMPLE_READ) D - pin the event to the
PMU</p>

<p>The p modifier can be used for specifying how precise
the instruction address should be. The p modifier can be
specified multiple times:</p>

<p>0 - SAMPLE_IP can have arbitrary skid 1 - SAMPLE_IP must
have constant skid 2 - SAMPLE_IP requested to have 0 skid 3
- SAMPLE_IP must have 0 skid</p>

<p>For Intel systems precise event sampling is implemented
with PEBS which supports up to precise-level 2.</p>

<p>On AMD systems it is implemented using IBS (up to
precise-level 2). The precise modifier works with event
types 0x76 (cpu-cycles, CPU clocks not halted) and 0xC1
(micro-ops retired). Both events map to IBS execution
sampling (IBS op) with the IBS Op Counter Control bit
(IbsOpCntCtl) set respectively (see AMD64 Architecture
Programmers Manual Volume 2: System Programming, 13.3
Instruction-Based Sampling). Examples to use IBS:</p>

<p>perf record -a -e cpu-cycles:p ... # use ibs op counting
cycles perf record -a -e r076:p ... # same as -e
cpu-cycles:p perf record -a -e r0C1:p ... # use ibs op
counting micro-ops</p>

<p>RAW HARDWARE EVENT DESCRIPTOR Even when an event is not
available in a symbolic form within perf right now, it can
be encoded in a per processor specific way.</p>

<p>For instance For x86 CPUs NNN represents the raw
register encoding with the layout of IA32_PERFEVTSELx MSRs
(see [Intel&reg; 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
Developers Manual Volume 3B: System Programming Guide]
Figure 30-1 Layout of IA32_PERFEVTSELx MSRs) or AMD s
PerfEvtSeln (see [AMD64 Architecture Programmers Manual
Volume 2: System Programming], Page 344, Figure 13-7
Performance Event-Select Register (PerfEvtSeln)).</p>

<p>Note: Only the following bit fields can be set in x86
counter registers: event, umask, edge, inv, cmask. Esp.
guest/host only and OS/user mode flags must be setup using
EVENT MODIFIERS.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>If the Intel docs for a QM720 Core i7 describe an event
as:</p>

<p>Event Umask Event Mask Num. Value Mnemonic Description
Comment</p>

<p>A8H 01H LSD.UOPS Counts the number of micro-ops Use
cmask=1 and delivered by loop stream detector invert to
count cycles</p>

<p>raw encoding of 0x1A8 can be used:</p>

<p>perf stat -e r1a8 -a sleep 1 perf record -e r1a8 ...</p>

<p>You should refer to the processor specific documentation
for getting these details. Some of them are referenced in
the SEE ALSO section below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Without options all known events will be
listed.</p>

<p>To limit the list use:</p>

<p>1. hw or hardware to list hardware events such as
cache-misses, etc.</p>

<p>2. sw or software to list software events such as
context switches, etc.</p>

<p>3. cache or hwcache to list hardware cache events such
as L1-dcache-loads, etc.</p>

<p>4. tracepoint to list all tracepoint events,
alternatively use subsys_glob:event_glob to filter by
tracepoint subsystems such as sched, block, etc.</p>

<p>5. pmu to print the kernel supplied PMU events.</p>

<p>6. If none of the above is matched, it will apply the
supplied glob to all events, printing the ones that
match.</p>

<p>One or more types can be used at the same time, listing
the events for the types specified.</p>
