<p>NAME cupsfilter - convert a file to another format using
cups filters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cupsfilter [ -c config-file ] [ -e ] -j
job-id[,N] [ -m mime/type ] [ -n copies ] [ -o name=value ]
[ -p filename.ppd ] [ -t title ] filename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cupsfilter is a front-end to the CUPS filter
subsystem which allows you to convert a file to a specific
format, just as if you had printed the file through CUPS. By
default, cupsfilter generates a PDF file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c config-file Uses the named cupsd.conf
configuration file.</p>

<p>-e Use every filter from the PPD file.</p>

<p>-j job-id[,N] Converts document N from the specified
job. If N is omitted, docu- ment 1 is converted.</p>

<p>-m mime/type Specifies the destination file type. The
default file type is application/pdf. Use printer/foo to
convert to the printer format defined by the filters in the
PPD file.</p>

<p>-n copies Specifies the number of copies to
generate.</p>

<p>-o name=value Specifies options to pass to the CUPS
filters.</p>

<p>-p filename.ppd Specifies the PPD file to use.</p>

<p>-t title Specifies the document title.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES cupsfilter currently does not use the
filters defined in the PPD file. This will be addressed in a
future CUPS release.</p>
