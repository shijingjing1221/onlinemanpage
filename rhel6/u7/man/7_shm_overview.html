<p>NAME shm_overview - Overview of POSIX shared memory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The POSIX shared memory API allows processes
to communicate information by sharing a region of
memory.</p>

<p>The interfaces employed in the API are:</p>

<p>shm_open(3) Create and open a new object, or open an
existing object. This is analogous to open(2). The call
returns a file descriptor for use by the other interfaces
listed below.</p>

<p>ftruncate(2) Set the size of the shared memory object.
(A newly cre- ated shared memory object has a length of
zero.)</p>

<p>mmap(2) Map the shared memory object into the virtual
address space of the calling process.</p>

<p>munmap(2) Unmap the shared memory object from the
virtual address space of the calling process.</p>

<p>shm_unlink(3) Remove a shared memory object name.</p>

<p>close(2) Close the file descriptor allocated by
shm_open(3) when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>fstat(2) Obtain a stat structure that describes the
shared memory object. Among the information returned by this
call are the objects size (st_size), permissions (st_mode),
owner (st_uid), and group (st_gid).</p>

<p>fchown(2) To change the ownership of a shared memory
object.</p>

<p>fchmod(2) To change the permissions of a shared memory
object.</p>

<p>Versions POSIX shared memory is supported since Linux
2.4 and glibc 2.2.</p>

<p>Persistence POSIX shared memory objects have kernel
persistence: a shared memory object will exist until the
system is shut down, or until all processes have unmapped
the object and it has been deleted with shm_unlink(3)</p>

<p>Linking Programs using the POSIX shared memory API must
be compiled with cc -lrt to link against the real-time
library, librt.</p>

<p>Accessing shared memory objects via the file system On
Linux, shared memory objects are created in a (tmpfs)
virtual file system, normally mounted under /dev/shm. Since
kernel 2.6.19, Linux supports the use of access control
lists (ACLs) to control the permis- sions of objects in the
virtual file system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Typically, processes must synchronize their access
to a shared memory object, using, for example, POSIX
semaphores.</p>

<p>System V shared memory (shmget(2), shmop(2), etc.) is an
older semaphore API. POSIX shared memory provides a simpler,
and better designed interface; on the other hand POSIX
shared memory is somewhat less widely available (especially
on older systems) than System V shared memory.</p>
