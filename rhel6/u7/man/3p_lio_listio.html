<p>LIO_LISTIO(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
LIO_LISTIO(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME lio_listio - list directed I/O (REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int lio_listio(int mode, struct aiocb *restrict const
list[restrict], int nent, struct sigevent *restrict
sig);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The lio_listio() function shall initiate a
list of I/O requests with a single function call.</p>

<p>The mode argument takes one of the values LIO_WAIT or
LIO_NOWAIT declared in &lt;aio.h&gt; and determines whether
the function returns when the I/O operations have been
completed, or as soon as the operations have been queued. If
the mode argument is LIO_WAIT, the function shall wait until
all I/O is complete and the sig argument shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>If the mode argument is LIO_NOWAIT, the function shall
return immedi- ately, and asynchronous notification shall
occur, according to the sig argument, when all the I/O
operations complete. If sig is NULL, then no asynchronous
notification shall occur. If sig is not NULL, asyn- chronous
notification occurs as specified in Signal Generation and
Delivery when all the requests in list have completed.</p>

<p>The I/O requests enumerated by list are submitted in an
unspecified order.</p>

<p>The list argument is an array of pointers to aiocb
structures. The array contains nent elements. The array may
contain NULL elements, which shall be ignored.</p>

<p>The aio_lio_opcode field of each aiocb structure
specifies the opera- tion to be performed. The supported
operations are LIO_READ, LIO_WRITE, and LIO_NOP; these
symbols are defined in &lt;aio.h&gt;. The LIO_NOP opera-
tion causes the list entry to be ignored. If the
aio_lio_opcode element is equal to LIO_READ, then an I/O
operation is submitted as if by a call to aio_read() with
the aiocbp equal to the address of the aiocb structure. If
the aio_lio_opcode element is equal to LIO_WRITE, then an
I/O operation is submitted as if by a call to aio_write()
with the aiocbp equal to the address of the aiocb
structure.</p>

<p>The aio_fildes member specifies the file descriptor on
which the opera- tion is to be performed.</p>

<p>The aio_buf member specifies the address of the buffer
to or from which the data is transferred.</p>

<p>The aio_nbytes member specifies the number of bytes of
data to be transferred.</p>

<p>The members of the aiocb structure further describe the
I/O operation to be performed, in a manner identical to that
of the corresponding aiocb structure when used by the
aio_read() and aio_write() functions.</p>

<p>The nent argument specifies how many elements are
members of the list; that is, the length of the array.</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is altered according to
the definitions of synchronized I/O data integrity
completion and synchronized I/O file integrity completion if
synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associ- ated with
aio_fildes.</p>

<p>For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the
offset maximum established in the open file description
associated with aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the mode argument has the value
LIO_NOWAIT, the lio_listio() func- tion shall return the
value zero if the I/O operations are successfully queued;
otherwise, the function shall return the value -1 and set
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>If the mode argument has the value LIO_WAIT, the
lio_listio() function shall return the value zero when all
the indicated I/O has completed successfully. Otherwise,
lio_listio() shall return a value of -1 and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>In either case, the return value only indicates the
success or failure of the lio_listio() call itself, not the
status of the individual I/O requests. In some cases one or
more of the I/O requests contained in the list may fail.
Failure of an individual request does not prevent completion
of any other individual request. To determine the outcome of
each I/O request, the application shall examine the error
status associated with each aiocb control block. The error
statuses so returned are identical to those returned as the
result of an aio_read() or aio_write() function.</p>

<p>ERRORS The lio_listio() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The resources necessary to queue all the I/O
requests were not available. The application may check the
error status for each aiocb to determine the individual
request(s) that failed.</p>

<p>EAGAIN The number of entries indicated by nent would
cause the system- wide limit {AIO_MAX} to be exceeded.</p>

<p>EINVAL The mode argument is not a proper value, or the
value of nent was greater than {AIO_LISTIO_MAX}.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was delivered while waiting for all I/O
requests to complete during an LIO_WAIT operation. Note
that, since each I/O operation invoked by lio_listio() may
possibly provoke a signal when it completes, this error
return may be caused by the com- pletion of one (or more) of
the very I/O operations being awaited. Outstanding I/O
requests are not canceled, and the application shall examine
each list element to determine whether the request was
initiated, canceled, or completed.</p>

<p>EIO One or more of the individual I/O operations failed.
The appli- cation may check the error status for each aiocb
structure to determine the individual request(s) that
failed.</p>

<p>In addition to the errors returned by the lio_listio()
function, if the lio_listio() function succeeds or fails
with errors of [EAGAIN], [EINTR], or [EIO], then some of the
I/O specified by the list may have been initiated. If the
lio_listio() function fails with an error code other than
[EAGAIN], [EINTR], or [EIO], no operations from the list
shall have been initiated. The I/O operation indicated by
each list element can encounter errors specific to the
individual read or write function being performed. In this
event, the error status for each aiocb control block
contains the associated error code. The error codes that can
be set are the same as would be set by a read() or write()
function, with the following additional error codes
possible:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The requested I/O operation was not queued due to
resource limi- tations.</p>

<p>ECANCELED The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O
completed due to an explicit aio_cancel() request.</p>

<p>EFBIG The aiocbp-&gt;aio_lio_opcode is LIO_WRITE, the
file is a regular file, aiocbp-&gt;aio_nbytes is greater
than 0, and the aiocbp-&gt;aio_offset is greater than or
equal to the offset maxi- mum in the open file description
associated with aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes.</p>

<p>EINPROGRESS The requested I/O is in progress.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The aiocbp-&gt;aio_lio_opcode is LIO_READ, the
file is a regular file, aiocbp-&gt;aio_nbytes is greater
than 0, and the aiocbp-&gt;aio_offset is before the
end-of-file and is greater than or equal to the offset
maximum in the open file description associated with
aiocbp-&gt;aio_fildes.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Although it may appear that there are
inconsistencies in the specified circumstances for error
codes, the [EIO] error condition applies when any
circumstance relating to an individual operation makes that
opera- tion fail. This might be due to a badly formulated
request (for exam- ple, the aio_lio_opcode field is invalid,
and aio_error() returns [EIN- VAL]) or might arise from
application behavior (for example, the file descriptor is
closed before the operation is initiated, and aio_error()
returns [EBADF]).</p>

<p>The limitation on the set of error codes returned when
operations from the list shall have been initiated enables
applications to know when operations have been started and
whether aio_error() is valid for a specific operation.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
