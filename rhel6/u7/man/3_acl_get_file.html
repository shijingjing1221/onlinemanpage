<p>ACL_GET_FILE(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_GET_FILE(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_get_file - get an ACL by filename</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>acl_t acl_get_file(const char *path_p, acl_type_t
type);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_get_file() function retrieves the
access ACL associated with a file or directory, or the
default ACL associated with a directory. The pathname for
the file or directory is pointed to by the argument path_p.
The ACL is placed into working storage and acl_get_file()
returns a pointer to that storage.</p>

<p>In order to read an ACL from an object, a process must
have read access to the objects attributes.</p>

<p>The value of the argument type is used to indicate
whether the access ACL or the default ACL associated with
path_p is returned. If type is ACL_TYPE_ACCESS, the access
ACL of path_p is returned. If type is ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT, the
default ACL of path_p is returned. If type is
ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT and no default ACL is associated with the
directory path_p, then an ACL containing zero ACL entries is
returned. If type specifies a type of ACL that cannot be
associated with path_p, then the function fails.</p>

<p>This function may cause memory to be allocated. The
caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL
is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with the
(void*)acl_t returned by acl_get_file() as an argu-
ment.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, this function returns a pointer
to the working storage. On error, a value of (acl_t)NULL is
returned, and errno is set appropri- ately.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_get_file() function returns a value of (acl_t)NULL and
sets errno to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EACCES] Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix or the object exists and the process does
not have appropriate access rights.</p>

<p>Argument type specifies a type of ACL that cannot be
associated with path_p.</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument type is not ACL_TYPE_ACCESS or
ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT.</p>

<p>[ENAMETOOLONG] The length of the argument path_p is too
long.</p>

<p>[ENOENT] The named object does not exist or the argument
path_p points to an empty string.</p>

<p>[ENOMEM] The ACL working storage requires more memory
than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory
man- agement constraints.</p>

<p>[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] The file system on which the file identified
by path_p is located does not support ACLs, or ACLs are dis-
abled.</p>
