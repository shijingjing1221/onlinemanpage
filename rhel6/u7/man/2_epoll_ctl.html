<p>EPOLL_CTL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual EPOLL_CTL(2)</p>

<p>NAME epoll_ctl - control interface for an epoll
descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;</p>

<p>int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct
epoll_event *event);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This system call performs control operations
on the epoll instance referred to by the file descriptor
epfd. It requests that the opera- tion op be performed for
the target file descriptor, fd.</p>

<p>Valid values for the op argument are :</p>

<p>EPOLL_CTL_ADD Register the target file descriptor fd on
the epoll instance referred to by the file descriptor epfd
and associate the event event with the internal file linked
to fd.</p>

<p>EPOLL_CTL_MOD Change the event event associated with the
target file descrip- tor fd.</p>

<p>EPOLL_CTL_DEL Remove (deregister) the target file
descriptor fd from the epoll instance referred to by epfd.
The event is ignored and can be NULL (but see BUGS
below).</p>

<p>The event argument describes the object linked to the
file descriptor fd. The struct epoll_event is defined as
:</p>

<p>typedef union epoll_data { void *ptr; int fd; __uint32_t
u32; __uint64_t u64; } epoll_data_t;</p>

<p>struct epoll_event { __uint32_t events; /* Epoll events
*/ epoll_data_t data; /* User data variable */ };</p>

<p>The events member is a bit set composed using the
following available event types:</p>

<p>EPOLLIN The associated file is available for read(2)
operations.</p>

<p>EPOLLOUT The associated file is available for write(2)
operations.</p>

<p>EPOLLRDHUP (since Linux 2.6.17) Stream socket peer
closed connection, or shut down writing half of connection.
(This flag is especially useful for writing sim- ple code to
detect peer shutdown when using Edge Triggered moni-
toring.)</p>

<p>EPOLLPRI There is urgent data available for read(2)
operations.</p>

<p>EPOLLERR Error condition happened on the associated file
descriptor. epoll_wait(2) will always wait for this event;
it is not neces- sary to set it in events.</p>

<p>EPOLLHUP Hang up happened on the associated file
descriptor. epoll_wait(2) will always wait for this event;
it is not neces- sary to set it in events.</p>

<p>EPOLLET Sets the Edge Triggered behavior for the
associated file descriptor. The default behavior for epoll
is Level Triggered. See epoll(7) for more detailed
information about Edge and Level Triggered event
distribution architectures.</p>

<p>EPOLLONESHOT (since Linux 2.6.2) Sets the one-shot
behavior for the associated file descriptor. This means that
after an event is pulled out with epoll_wait(2) the
associated file descriptor is internally disabled and no
other events will be reported by the epoll interface. The
user must call epoll_ctl() with EPOLL_CTL_MOD to re-arm the
file descriptor with a new event mask.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE When successful, epoll_ctl() returns zero.
When an error occurs, epoll_ctl() returns -1 and errno is
set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF epfd or fd is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EEXIST op was EPOLL_CTL_ADD, and the supplied file
descriptor fd is already registered with this epoll
instance.</p>

<p>EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or fd is
the same as epfd, or the requested operation op is not
supported by this inter- face.</p>

<p>ENOENT op was EPOLL_CTL_MOD or EPOLL_CTL_DEL, and fd is
not registered on with this epoll instance.</p>

<p>ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to handle the
requested op control operation.</p>

<p>The limit imposed by /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches
was encountered while trying to register (EPOLL_CTL_ADD) a
new file descriptor on an epoll instance. See epoll(7) for
further details.</p>

<p>EPERM The target file fd does not support epoll.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO epoll_ctl() is Linux-specific, and was
introduced in kernel 2.5.44.</p>

<p>NOTES The epoll interface supports all file descriptors
that support poll(2).</p>

<p>BUGS In kernel versions before 2.6.9, the EPOLL_CTL_DEL
operation required a non-NULL pointer in event, even though
this argument is ignored. Since Linux 2.6.9, event can be
specified as NULL when using EPOLL_CTL_DEL. Applications
that need to be portable to kernels before 2.6.9 should
specify a non-NULL pointer in event.</p>
