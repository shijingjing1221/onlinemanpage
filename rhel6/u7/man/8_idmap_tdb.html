<p>NAME idmap_tdb - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_tdb Backend for
Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_tdb plugin is the default backend
used by winbindd for storing SID/uid/gid mapping tables.</p>

<p>In contrast to read only backends like idmap_rid, it is
an allocating backend: This means that it needs to allocate
new user and group IDs in order to create new mappings.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS range = low - high Defines the available
matching uid and gid range for which the backend is
authoritative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example shows how tdb is used as a the
default idmap backend. This configured range is used for uid
and gid allocation.</p>

<p>[global] # &quot;backend = tdb&quot; is redundant here
since it is the default idmap config * : backend = tdb idmap
config * : range = 1000000-2000000</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
