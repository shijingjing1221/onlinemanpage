<p>CREAT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CREAT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME creat - create a new file or rewrite an existing
one</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; #include
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The function call:</p>

<p>creat(path, mode)</p>

<p>shall be equivalent to:</p>

<p>open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, mode)</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Refer to open().</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to open().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating a File The following example creates
the file /tmp/file with read and write permissions for the
file owner and read permission for group and oth- ers. The
resulting file descriptor is assigned to the fd
variable.</p>

<p>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; ... int fd; mode_t mode =
S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH; char *filename =
&quot;/tmp/file&quot;; ... fd = creat(filename, mode);
...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The creat() function is redundant. Its
services are also provided by the open() function. It has
been included primarily for historical pur- poses since many
existing applications depend on it. It is best consid- ered
a part of the C binding rather than a function that should
be pro- vided in other languages.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

1003.1-2001, &lt;fcntl.h&gt;, &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;,
