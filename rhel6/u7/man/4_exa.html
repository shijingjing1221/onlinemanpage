<p>NAME exa - new 2D acceleration architecture for
X.Org</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION EXA provides a simple API for video drivers
to implement for 2D accel- eration. It is a module loaded by
drivers, and is not intended to be loaded on its own. See
your drivers manual page for how to enable EXA.</p>

<p>The EXA architecture is designed to make accelerating
the Render exten- sion simple and efficient, and results in
various performance tradeoffs compared to XAA. Some
xorg.conf options are available for debugging performance
issues or driver rendering problems. They are not intended
for general use.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EXANoComposite&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disables acceleration of the Composite operation, which is
at the heart of the Render extension. Not related to the
Composite extension. Default: No.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EXANoUploadToScreen&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; Disables acceleration of uploading
pixmap data to the frame- buffer. Default: No.</p>

<p>Option &quot;EXANoDownloadFromScreen&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; Disables acceleration of downloading of
pixmap data from the framebuffer. NOTE: Not usable with
drivers which rely on Down- loadFromScreen succeeding.
Default: No.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MigrationHeuristic&quot; &quot;anystr&quot;
Chooses an alternate pixmap migration heuristic, for
debugging purposes. The default is intended to be the best
performing one for general use, though others may help with
specific use cases. Available options include
&quot;always&quot;, &quot;greedy&quot;, and
&quot;smart&quot;. Default: always.</p>
