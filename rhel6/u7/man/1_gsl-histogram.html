<p>NAME gsl-histogram - compute histogram of data on
stdin</p>

<p>SYNOPSYS gsl-histogram xmin xmax [n]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gsl-histogram is a demonstration program for
the GNU Scientific Library. It takes three arguments,
specifying the upper and lower bounds of the histogram and
the number of bins. It then reads numbers from stdin , one
line at a time, and adds them to the histogram. When there
is no more data to read it prints out the accumulated
histogram using gsl_histogram_fprintf. If n is unspecified
then bins of integer width are used.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Here is an example. We generate 10000 random
samples from a Cauchy distribution with a width of 30 and
histogram them over the range -100 to 100, using 200
bins.</p>

<p>gsl-randist 0 10000 cauchy 30 | gsl-histogram -100 100
200 &gt; his- togram.dat</p>

<p>A plot of the resulting histogram will show the familiar
shape of the Cauchy distribution with fluctuations caused by
the finite sample size.</p>

<p>awk {print $1, $3 ; print $2, $3} histogram.dat | graph
-T X</p>
