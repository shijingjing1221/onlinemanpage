<p>POSIX_FALLOCATE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_FALLOCATE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_fallocate - file space control (ADVANCED
REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_fallocate(int fd, off_t offset, size_t
len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_fallocate() function shall ensure
that any required storage for regular file data starting at
offset and continuing for len bytes is allocated on the file
system storage media. If posix_fallocate() returns
successfully, subsequent writes to the specified file data
shall not fail due to the lack of free space on the file
system storage media.</p>

<p>If the offset+ len is beyond the current file size, then
posix_fallo- cate() shall adjust the file size to offset+
len. Otherwise, the file size shall not be changed.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined whether a previous
posix_fadvise() call influences allocation strategy.</p>

<p>Space allocated via posix_fallocate() shall be freed by
a successful call to creat() or open() that truncates the
size of the file. Space allocated via posix_fallocate() may
be freed by a successful call to ftruncate() that reduces
the file size to a size smaller than offset+ len.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
posix_fallocate() shall return zero; other- wise, an error
number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_fallocate() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fd argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EBADF The fd argument references a file that was opened
without write permission.</p>

<p>EFBIG The value of offset+ len is greater than the
maximum file size.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during execution.</p>

<p>EINVAL The len argument was zero or the offset argument
was less than zero.</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing
to a file system.</p>

<p>ENODEV The fd argument does not refer to a regular
file.</p>

<p>ENOSPC There is insufficient free space remaining on the
file system storage media.</p>

<p>ESPIPE The fd argument is associated with a pipe or
FIFO.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The posix_fallocate() function is part
of the Advisory Information option and need not be provided
on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
