<p>XmSetProtocolHooks(library call)
XmSetProtocolHooks(library call)</p>

<p>NAME XmSetProtocolHooks A VendorShell function that
allows preactions and postactions to be executed when a
protocol message is received from MWM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt; #include
&lt;Xm/Protocols.h&gt; void XmSetProtocolHooks( Widget
shell, Atom property, Atom protocol, XtCallbackProc prehook,
XtPointer pre_closure, XtCallbackProc posthook, XtPointer
post_closure);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmSetProtocolHooks is used by shells that
want to have preactions and postactions executed when a
protocol message is received from MWM. Since there is no
guaranteed ordering in execution of event handlers or
callback lists, this allows the shell to control the flow
while leaving the protocol manager structures opaque.</p>

<p>XmSetWMProtocolHooks is a convenience interface. It
calls XmSetProto- colHooks with the property value set to
the atom returned by interning WM_PROTOCOLS.</p>

<p>shell Specifies the widget with which the protocol
property is associated</p>

<p>property Specifies the protocol property</p>

<p>protocol Specifies the protocol atom</p>

<p>prehook Specifies the procedure to call before calling
entries on the client callback list</p>

<p>pre_closure Specifies the client data to be passed to
the prehook when it is invoked</p>

<p>posthook Specifies the procedure to call after calling
entries on the client callback list</p>

<p>post_closure Specifies the client data to be passed to
the posthook when it is invoked</p>
