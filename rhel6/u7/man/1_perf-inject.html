<p>NAME perf-inject - Filter to augment the events stream
with additional information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf inject &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION perf-inject reads a perf-record event stream
and repipes it to stdout. At any point the processing code
can inject other events into the event stream - in this case
build-ids (-b option) are read and injected as needed into
the event stream.</p>

<p>Build-ids are just the first user of perf-inject -
potentially anything that needs userspace processing to
augment the events stream with additional information could
make use of this facility.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b, --build-ids= Inject build-ids into the
output stream</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be more verbose.</p>

<p>-i, --input= Input file name. (default: stdin)</p>

<p>-o, --output= Output file name. (default: stdout)</p>

<p>-s, --sched-stat Merge sched_stat and sched_switch for
getting events where and how long tasks slept. sched_switch
contains a callchain where a task slept and sched_stat
contains a timeslice how long a task slept.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO perf-record(1), perf-report(1),
perf-archive(1)</p>
