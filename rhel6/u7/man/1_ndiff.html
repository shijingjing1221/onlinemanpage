<p>NAME ndiff - Utility to compare the results of Nmap
scans</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ndiff [options] {a.xml} {b.xml}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ndiff is a tool to aid in the comparison of
Nmap scans. It takes two Nmap XML output files and prints
the differences between them. The differences observed
are:</p>

<p>&middot; Host states (e.g. up to down)</p>

<p>&middot; Port states (e.g. open to closed)</p>

<p>&middot; Service versions (from -sV)</p>

<p>&middot; OS matches (from -O)</p>

<p>&middot; Script output</p>

<p>Ndiff, like the standard diff utility, compares two
scans at a time.</p>

<p>OPTIONS SUMMARY -h, --help Show a help message and
exit.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Include all hosts and ports in the output,
not only those that have changed.</p>

<p>--text Write output in human-readable text format.</p>

<p>--xml Write output in machine-readable XML format. The
document structure is defined in the file ndiff.dtd included
in the distribution.</p>

<p>Any other arguments are taken to be the names of Nmap
XML output files. There must be exactly two.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Let&acute;s use Ndiff to compare the output of
two Nmap scans that use different options. In the first,
we&acute;ll do a fast scan (-F), which scans fewer ports for
speed. In the second, we&acute;ll scan the larger default
set of ports, and run an NSE script.</p>

<p># nmap -F scanme.nmap.org -oX scanme-1.xml # nmap
--script=html-title scanme.nmap.org -oX scanme-2.xml $ ndiff
-v scanme-1.xml scanme-2.xml -Nmap 5.35DC1 at 2010-07-16
12:09 +Nmap 5.35DC1 at 2010-07-16 12:13</p>

<p>scanme.nmap.org (64.13.134.52): Host is up. -Not shown:
95 filtered ports +Not shown: 993 filtered ports PORT STATE
SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh 25/tcp closed smtp 53/tcp
open domain +70/tcp closed gopher 80/tcp open http +|_
html-title: Go ahead and ScanMe! 113/tcp closed auth
+31337/tcp closed Elite</p>

<p>Changes are marked by a - or + at the beginning of a
line. We can see from the output that the scan without the
-F fast scan option found two additional ports: 70 and
31337. The html-title script produced some additional output
for port 80. From the port counts, we may infer that the
fast scan scanned 100 ports (95 filtered, 3 open, and 2
closed), while the normal scan scanned 1000 (993 filtered, 3
open, and 4 closed).</p>

<p>The -v (or --verbose) option to Ndiff made it show even
the ports that didn&acute;t change, like 22 and 25. Without
-v, they would not have been shown.</p>

<p>OUTPUT There are two output modes: text and XML. Text
output is the default, and can also be selected with the
--text option. Text output resembles a unified diff of
Nmap&acute;s normal terminal output. Each line is preceded
by a character indicating whether and how it changed. -
means that the line was in the first scan but not in the
second; + means it was in the second but not the first. A
line that changed is represented by a - line followed by a +
line. Lines that did not change are preceded by a blank
space.</p>

<p>Example 1 is an example of text output. Here, port 80 on
the host photos-cache-snc1.facebook.com gained a service
version (lighttpd 1.5.0). The host at 69.63.179.25 changed
its reverse DNS name. The host at 69.63.184.145 was
completely absent in the first scan but came up in the
second.</p>

<p>Example 1. Ndiff text output</p>

<p>-Nmap 4.85BETA3 at 2009-03-15 11:00 +Nmap 4.85BETA4 at
2009-03-18 11:00</p>

<p>photos-cache-snc1.facebook.com (69.63.178.41): Host is
up. Not shown: 99 filtered ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
-80/tcp open http +80/tcp open http lighttpd 1.5.0</p>

<p>-cm.out.snc1.tfbnw.net (69.63.179.25):
+mailout-snc1.facebook.com (69.63.179.25): Host is up. Not
shown: 100 filtered ports</p>

<p>+69.63.184.145: +Host is up. +Not shown: 98 filtered
ports +PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION +80/tcp open http Apache
httpd 1.3.41.fb1 +443/tcp open ssl/http Apache httpd
1.3.41.fb1</p>

<p>XML output, intended to be processed by other programs,
is selected with the --xml option. It is based on
Nmap&acute;s XML output, with a few additional elements to
indicate differences. The XML document is enclosed in
nmapdiff and scandiff elements. Host differences are
enclosed in hostdiff tags and port differences are enclosed
in portdiff tags. Inside a hostdiff or portdiff, a and b
tags show the state of the host or port in the first scan
(a) or the second scan (b).</p>

<p>Example 2 shows the XML diff of the same scans shown
above in Example 1. Notice how port 80 of
photos-cache-snc1.facebook.com is enclosed in portdiff tags.
For 69.63.179.25, the old hostname is in a tags and the new
is in b. For the new host 69.63.184.145, there is a b in the
hostdiff without a corresponding a, indicating that there
was no information for the host in the first scan.</p>

<p>PERIODIC DIFFS Using Nmap, Ndiff, cron, and a shell
script, it&acute;s possible to scan a network daily and get
email reports of the state of the network and changes since
the previous scan. Example 3 shows the script that ties it
together.</p>

<p>Example 3. Scanning a network periodically with Ndiff
and cron</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh TARGETS=&quot;targets&quot; OPTIONS=&quot;-v
-T4 -F -sV&quot; date=date +%F cd /root/scans nmap $OPTIONS
$TARGETS -oA scan-$date &gt; /dev/null if [ -e scan-prev.xml
]; then ndiff scan-prev.xml scan-$date.xml &gt; diff-$date
echo &quot;*** NDIFF RESULTS ***&quot; cat diff-$date echo
fi echo &quot;*** NMAP RESULTS ***&quot; cat scan-$date.nmap
ln -sf scan-$date.xml scan-prev.xml</p>

<p>If the script is saved as /root/scan-ndiff.sh, add the
following line to root&acute;s crontab:</p>

<p>0 12 * * * /root/scan-ndiff.sh</p>

<p>EXIT CODE The exit code indicates whether the scans are
equal.</p>

<p>&middot; 0 means that the scans are the same in all the
aspects Ndiff knows about.</p>

<p>&middot; 1 means that the scans differ.</p>

<p>&middot; 2 indicates a runtime error, such as the
failure to open a file.</p>

<p>HISTORY Ndiff started as a project by Michael Pattrick
during the 2008 Google Summer of Code. Michael designed the
program and led the discussion of its output formats. He
wrote versions of the program in Perl and C++, but the
summer ended shortly after it was decided to rewrite the
program in Python for the sake of Windows (and Zenmap)
compatibility. This Python version was written by David
Fifield. James Levine released[1] a Perl script named Ndiff
with similar functionality in 2000.</p>
