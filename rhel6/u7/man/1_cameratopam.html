<p>NAME cameratopam - convert raw camera image to PAM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cameratopam</p>

<p>[input_file_name]</p>

<p>[-identify_only] [-quick_interpolate] [-half_size]
[-four_color_rgb] [-document_mode] [-balance_auto]
[-balance_camera] [-red_scale=float] [-blue_scale=float]
[-bright=fraction] [-no_clip_color] [-rgb] [-use_secondary]
[-linear] [-verbose]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>cameratopam converts from any of dozens of raw camera
image formats to PAM.</p>

<p>Digital still cameras often can produce images in a
special raw format in addition to something more standard
such as TIFF or JFIF (JPEG). Software supplied with the
camera allows you to manipulate the image using information
which is lost when the camera converts to the common format.
A particular camera model often has a unique raw format.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -identify_only Report to Standard Error the
format of the input image but dont generate an output image.
Program fails if it cannot recognize the format.</p>

<p>-verbose Report to Standard Error details of the
processing.</p>

<p>-quick_interpolate Use simple bilinear interpolation for
quick results. The default is to use a slow, high-quality
adaptive algorithm.</p>

<p>-half_size Half-size the output image. Instead of
interpolating, reduce each 2x2 block of sensors to one
pixel. Much faster than -quick_interpolate.</p>

<p>-four_color_rgb Interpolate RGB as four colors. This
causes a slight loss of detail, so use this only if you see
false 2x2 mesh patterns in blue sky.</p>

<p>-document_mode Show the raw data as a grayscale image
with no interpolation. This is good for photographing black
and white documents.</p>

<p>-balance_auto Automatic color balance. The default is to
use a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed
in sunlight.</p>

<p>-balance_camera Use the color balance specified by the
camera. If cameratopam cant find this, it prints a warning
and reverts to the default.</p>

<p>-red_scale=float</p>

<p>-blue_scalefloat Further adjust the color balance by
multiplying the red and blue channels by these values. Both
default to 1.0.</p>

<p>-bright=float Change the output brightness. Default is
1.0.</p>

<p>-no_clip_color By default, cameratoapm clips all colors
to prevent pink hues in the highlights. Combine this option
with -bright=0.25 to leave the image data completely
unclipped.</p>

<p>-rgb Write raw camera colors to the output file. By
default, camera- toapm converts to sRGB colorspace.</p>

<p>-use_secondary For cameras based on the Fuji Super CCD
SR, this option causes cameratopam to use the secondary
sensors, in effect underexpos- ing the image by four stops
to reveal detail in the highlights. cameratopam silently
ignores this option for all other cameras.</p>

<p>-linear This option causes cameratopam to generate a
variation on PAM that has linear color samples. In true PAM,
each sample in the image raster is gamma-corrected; i.e. it
is essentially pro- portional to brightness. With the linear
option, cameratopam generates an image in which the samples
are instead proportional to light intensity.</p>

<p>Without -linear, the image maxval is 255, so the image
contains one byte per sample. With -linear, the maxval is
65535, so the image contains two bytes per sample.</p>

<p>Without -linear, cameratopam uses a 99th percentile
white point. With -linear, it doesn t. I dont know what that
means.</p>

<p>HISTORY cameratopam was new in Netpbm 10.28 (June
2005).</p>

<p>It was derived from the program dcraw by Dave Coffin ,
by Bryan Hender- son in April 2005. Bryan replaced the part
that generates the Netpbm output image and removed the Adobe
Photoshop output function. Bryan changed the command syntax
and and made other small changes to make the program
consistent with Netpbm. He also split the source code into
manageable pieces (dcraw has a single 5000 line source
file).</p>
