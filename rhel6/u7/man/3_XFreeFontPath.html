<p>XSetFontPath(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XSetFontPath(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetFontPath, XGetFontPath, XFreeFontPath - set,
get, or free the font search path</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSetFontPath(Display *display, char
**directories, int ndirs);</p>

<p>char **XGetFontPath(Display *display, int
*npaths_return);</p>

<p>int XFreeFontPath(char **list);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS directories Specifies the directory path used
to look for a font. Set- ting the path to the empty list
restores the default path defined for the X server.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>list Specifies the array of strings you want to
free.</p>

<p>ndirs Specifies the number of directories in the
path.</p>

<p>npaths_return Returns the number of strings in the font
path array.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetFontPath function defines the
directory search path for font lookup. There is only one
search path per X server, not one per client. The encoding
and interpretation of the strings are implementa-
tion-dependent, but typically they specify directories or
font servers to be searched in the order listed. An X server
is permitted to cache font information internally; for
example, it might cache an entire font from a file and not
check on subsequent opens of that font to see if the
underlying font file has changed. However, when the font
path is changed, the X server is guaranteed to flush all
cached information about fonts for which there currently are
no explicit resource IDs allocated. The meaning of an error
from this request is implementa- tion-dependent.</p>

<p>XSetFontPath can generate a BadValue error.</p>

<p>The XGetFontPath function allocates and returns an array
of strings containing the search path. The contents of these
strings are imple- mentation-dependent and are not intended
to be interpreted by client applications. When it is no
longer needed, the data in the font path should be freed by
using XFreeFontPath.</p>

<p>The XFreeFontPath function frees the data allocated by
XGetFontPath.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadValue Some numeric value falls outside
the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a
specific range is specified for an argument, the full range
defined by the argument s type is accepted. Any argument
defined as a set of alternatives can generate this
error.</p>
