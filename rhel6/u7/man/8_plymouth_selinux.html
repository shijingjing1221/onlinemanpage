<p>plymouth_selinux(8) SELinux Policy plymouth
plymouth_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME plymouth_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the plymouth pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the plymouth
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The plymouth processes execute with the plymouth_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep plymouth_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The plymouth_t SELinux type can be entered
via the plymouth_exec_t file type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the plymouth_t domain
are the follow- ing:</p>

<p>/bin/plymouth</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux plymouth policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their plymouth processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
plymouth:</p>

<p>plymouth_t, plymouthd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a plymouth_t can be used to
make the process type plymouth_t permissive. SELinux does
not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC
(SELinux denials) messages are still gener- ated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. ply- mouth policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run plymouth with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type plymouth_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux plymouth policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their plymouth processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the plymouth,
if you wanted to store files with these types in a diffent
paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify
alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels
on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t plymouthd_var_run_t
/srv/myplymouth_con- tent(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/myplymouth_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for plymouth:</p>

<p>plymouth_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the plymouth_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the plymouth_t domain.</p>

<p>plymouthd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the plymouthd_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the plymouthd_t domain.</p>

<p>plymouthd_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the plymouthd_spool_t type, if you want
to store the plymouthd files under the /var/spool
directory.</p>

<p>plymouthd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the plymouthd_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the plymouthd files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>plymouthd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the plymouthd_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the plymouthd files under the /run or /var/run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
