<p>KMEM_CACHE_CREATE(9) Memory Management in Linux
KMEM_CACHE_CREATE(9)</p>

<p>NAME kmem_cache_create - Create a cache.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct kmem_cache * kmem_cache_create(const
char * name, size_t size, size_t align, unsigned long flags,
void (*ctor) (void *));</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS name A string which is used in /proc/slabinfo
to identify this cache.</p>

<p>size The size of objects to be created in this
cache.</p>

<p>align The required alignment for the objects.</p>

<p>flags SLAB flags</p>

<p>ctor A constructor for the objects.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Returns a ptr to the cache on success, NULL
on failure. Cannot be called within a int, but can be
interrupted. The ctor is run when new pages are allocated by
the cache.</p>

<p>name must be valid until the cache is destroyed. This
implies that the module calling this has to destroy the
cache before getting unloaded. Note that kmem_cache_name is
not guaranteed to return the same pointer, therefore
applications must manage it themselves.</p>

<p>The flags are</p>

<p>SLAB_POISON - Poison the slab with a known test pattern
(a5a5a5a5) to catch references to uninitialised memory.</p>

<p>SLAB_RED_ZONE - Insert Red&acute; zones around the
allocated memory to check for buffer overruns.</p>

<p>SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN - Align the objects in this cache to
a hardware cacheline. This can be beneficial if you&acute;re
counting cycles as closely as davem.</p>
