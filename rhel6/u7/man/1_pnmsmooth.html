<p>NAME pnmsmooth - smooth out an image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmsmooth [-width=cols] [-height=rows]
[-dump=dumpfile] [pnmfile] [-size]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviations of options is acceptable.
You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen to
denote options. You may use white space in place of the
equals sign to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmsmooth smoothes out an image by replacing each pixel
with the aver- age of its width X height neighbors. It is
implemented as a progam that generates a PGM convolution
matrix and then invokes pnmconvol with it.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -width=cols</p>

<p>-height=rows These options specify the dimensions of the
convolution matrix. Default dimensions are 3 wide and 3
high. Each dimension must be odd. The maximum size of the
convolution matrix is limited by the maxval of the image
such that width * height * 2 must not exceed the maxval.
(use pamdepth to increase the maxval if nec- essary).</p>

<p>These options were new in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).
Before that, use -size.</p>

<p>-size This deprecated option exists in current Netpbm
for backward compatibility. It was obsoleted by -width and
-height in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).</p>

<p>When you use this option, the first two program
arguments are the width and height, respectively, of the
convolution matrix and do the same thing as the -width and
-height option values. The third (optional) program argument
is the input file name.</p>

<p>In reality, in old pnmsmooth, the width and height are
two val- ues of the -size option, but the modern Netpbm
command syntax paradigm doesnt allow an option with multiple
values, so instead -size is an option with no value and
width and height are program arguments. That has the
fortunate effect of making the following command mean the
same in current pnmsmooth as in old pnmsmooth:</p>

<p>pnmsmooth -size 5 5 infile.ppm &gt;outfile.ppm</p>

<p>-dump=dumpfile This options makes pnmsmooth only
generate and save the convolu- tion file. It does not invoke
pnmconvol and does not produce an output image.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pnmconvol(1), pnm(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), pnmsmooth
did not use the modern Netpbm command line parser, so had an
unconventional command line syn- tax. Most importantly, you
could not use an equal size or double hyphens in the
options.</p>
