<p>setfilecon(3) SELinux API documentation
setfilecon(3)</p>

<p>NAME setfilecon, fsetfilecon, lsetfilecon - set SELinux
security context of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;selinux/selinux.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setfilecon(const char *path, security_context_t
con);</p>

<p>int lsetfilecon(const char *path, security_context_t
con);</p>

<p>int fsetfilecon(int fd, security_context_t con);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION setfilecon sets the security context of the
file system object.</p>

<p>lsetfilecon is identical to setfilecon, except in the
case of a sym- bolic link, where the link itself has its
context set, not the file that it refers to.</p>

<p>fsetfilecon is identical to setfilecon, only the open
file pointed to by filedes (as returned by open(2)) has its
context set in place of path.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On failure,
-1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>If there is insufficient space remaining to store the
extended attribute, errno is set to either ENOSPC, or EDQUOT
if quota enforce- ment was the cause.</p>

<p>If extended attributes are not supported by the
filesystem, or are dis- abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.</p>

<p>The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are
also applicable here.</p>
