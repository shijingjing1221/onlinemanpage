<p>NAME curl_global_cleanup - global libcurl cleanup</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>void curl_global_cleanup(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function releases resources acquired by
curl_global_init(3).</p>

<p>You should call curl_global_cleanup(3) once for each
call you make to curl_global_init(3), after you are done
using libcurl.</p>

<p>This function is not thread safe. You must not call it
when any other thread in the program (i.e. a thread sharing
the same memory) is run- ning. This doesnt just mean no
other thread that is using libcurl. Because
curl_global_cleanup(3) calls functions of other libraries
that are similarly thread unsafe, it could conflict with any
other thread that uses these other libraries.</p>

<p>See the description in libcurl(3) of global environment
requirements for details of how to use this function.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO curl_global_init(3), libcurl(3),</p>
