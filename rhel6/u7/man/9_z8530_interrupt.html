<p>Z8530_INTERRUPT(9) Public Functions Provided
Z8530_INTERRUPT(9)</p>

<p>NAME z8530_interrupt - Handle an interrupt from a
Z8530</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS irqreturn_t z8530_interrupt(int irq, void *
dev_id);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS irq Interrupt number</p>

<p>dev_id The Z8530 device that is interrupting.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A Z85[2]30 device has stuck its hand in the
air for attention. We scan both the channels on the chip for
events and then call the channel specific call backs for
each channel that has events. We have to use callback
functions because the two channels can be in different
modes.</p>

<p>Locking is done for the handlers. Note that locking is
done at the chip level (the 5uS delay issue is per chip not
per channel). c-&gt;lock for both channels points to
dev-&gt;lock</p>
