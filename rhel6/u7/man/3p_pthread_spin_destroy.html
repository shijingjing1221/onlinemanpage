<p>PTHREAD_SPIN_DESTROY(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_SPIN_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_spin_destroy, pthread_spin_init - destroy
or initialize a spin lock object (ADVANCED REALTIME
THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_spin_destroy(pthread_spinlock_t *lock); int
pthread_spin_init(pthread_spinlock_t *lock, int
pshared);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_spin_destroy() function shall
destroy the spin lock refer- enced by lock and release any
resources used by the lock. The effect of subsequent use of
the lock is undefined until the lock is reinitialized by
another call to pthread_spin_init(). The results are
undefined if pthread_spin_destroy() is called when a thread
holds the lock, or if this function is called with an
uninitialized thread spin lock.</p>

<p>The pthread_spin_init() function shall allocate any
resources required to use the spin lock referenced by lock
and initialize the lock to an unlocked state.</p>

<p>If the Thread Process-Shared Synchronization option is
supported and the value of pshared is
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED, the implementation shall permit the
spin lock to be operated upon by any thread that has access
to the memory where the spin lock is allocated, even if it
is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple
processes.</p>

<p>If the Thread Process-Shared Synchronization option is
supported and the value of pshared is
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, or if the option is not supported,
the spin lock shall only be operated upon by threads created
within the same process as the thread that initialized the
spin lock. If threads of differing processes attempt to
operate on such a spin lock, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The results are undefined if pthread_spin_init() is
called specifying an already initialized spin lock. The
results are undefined if a spin lock is used without first
being initialized.</p>

<p>If the pthread_spin_init() function fails, the lock is
not initialized and the contents of lock are undefined.</p>

<p>Only the object referenced by lock may be used for
performing synchro- nization.</p>

<p>The result of referring to copies of that object in
calls to pthread_spin_destroy(), pthread_spin_lock(),
pthread_spin_trylock(), or pthread_spin_unlock() is
undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The implementation has detected an attempt to
initialize or destroy a spin lock while it is in use (for
example, while being used in a pthread_spin_lock() call) by
another thread.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by lock is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_spin_init() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The system lacks the necessary resources to
initialize another spin lock.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
lock.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pthread_spin_destroy() and
pthread_spin_init() functions are part of the Spin Locks
option and need not be provided on all implementa-
tions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
