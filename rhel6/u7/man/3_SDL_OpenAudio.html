<p>SDL_OpenAudio(3) SDL API Reference SDL_OpenAudio(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_OpenAudio - Opens the audio device with the
desired parameters.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>int SDL_OpenAudio(SDL_AudioSpec *desired, SDL_AudioSpec
*obtained);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function opens the audio device with
the desired parameters, and returns 0 if successful, placing
the actual hardware parameters in the structure pointed to
by obtained. If obtained is NULL, the audio data passed to
the callback function will be guaranteed to be in the
requested format, and will be automatically converted to the
hardware audio format if necessary. This function returns -1
if it failed to open the audio device, or couldnt set up the
audio thread.</p>

<p>To open the audio device a desired SDL_AudioSpec must be
created.</p>

<p>SDL_AudioSpec *desired; . . desired=(SDL_AudioSpec
*)malloc(sizeof(SDL_AudioSpec));</p>

<p>You must then fill this structure with your desired
audio specifica- tions.</p>

<p>desired-&gt;freq</p>

<p>desired-&gt;format</p>

<p>desired-&gt;samples</p>

<p>desired-&gt;callback</p>

<p>void callback(void *userdata, Uint8 *stream, int
len);</p>

<p>userdata is the pointer stored in userdata field of the
SDL_AudioSpec. stream is a pointer to the audio buffer you
want to fill with informa- tion and len is the length of the
audio buffer in bytes.</p>

<p>desired-&gt;userdata</p>

<p>SDL_OpenAudio reads these fields from the desired
SDL_AudioSpec struc- ture pass to the function and attempts
to find an audio configuration matching your desired. As
mentioned above, if the obtained parameter is NULL then SDL
with convert from your desired audio settings to the
hardware settings as it plays.</p>

<p>If obtained is NULL then the desired SDL_AudioSpec is
your working specification, otherwise the obtained
SDL_AudioSpec becomes the working specification and the
desirec specification can be deleted. The data in the
working specification is used when building SDL_AudioCVTs
for con- verting loaded data to the hardware format.</p>

<p>SDL_OpenAudio calculates the size and silence fields for
both the desired and obtained specifications. The size field
stores the total size of the audio buffer in bytes, while
the silence stores the value used to represent silence in
the audio buffer</p>

<p>The audio device starts out playing silence when its
opened, and should be enabled for playing by calling
SDL_PauseAudio(0) when you are ready for your audio callback
function to be called. Since the audio driver may modify the
requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate any
local mixing buffers after you open the audio device.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES /* Prototype of our callback function */ void
my_audio_callback(void *userdata, Uint8 *stream, int
len);</p>

<p>/* Open the audio device */ SDL_AudioSpec *desired,
*obtained; SDL_AudioSpec *hardware_spec;</p>

<p>/* Allocate a desired SDL_AudioSpec */
desired=(SDL_AudioSpec *)malloc(sizeof(SDL_AudioSpec));</p>

<p>/* Allocate space for the obtained SDL_AudioSpec */
obtained=(SDL_AudioSpec *)malloc(sizeof(SDL_AudioSpec));</p>

<p>/* 22050Hz - FM Radio quality */
desired-&gt;freq=22050;</p>

<p>/* 16-bit signed audio */
desired-&gt;format=AUDIO_S16LSB;</p>

<p>/* Mono */ desired-&gt;channels=0;</p>

<p>/* Large audio buffer reduces risk of dropouts but
increases response time */ desired-&gt;samples=8192;</p>

<p>/* Our callback function */
desired-&gt;callback=my_audio_callback;</p>

<p>desired-&gt;userdata=NULL;</p>

<p>/* Open the audio device */ if ( SDL_OpenAudio(desired,
obtained) &lt; 0 ){ fprintf(stderr, &quot;Couldnt open
audio: %s &quot;, SDL_GetError()); exit(-1); } /* desired
spec is no longer needed */ free(desired);
hardware_spec=obtained; . . /* Prepare callback for playing
*/ . . . /* Start playing */ SDL_PauseAudio(0);</p>
