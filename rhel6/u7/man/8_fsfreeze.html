<p>NAME fsfreeze - suspend access to an filesystem (Linux
Ext3/4, ReiserFS, JFS, XFS).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fsfreeze -f mountpoint</p>

<p>fsfreeze -u mountpoint</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fsfreeze suspends and resumes access to an
filesystem</p>

<p>fsfreeze halts new access to the filesystem and creates
a stable image on disk. fsfreeze is intended to be used with
hardware RAID devices that support the creation of
snapshots.</p>

<p>fsfreeze is unncessary for device-mapper devices. The
device-mapper (and LVM) automatically freezes filesystem on
the device when a snap- shot creation is requested. For more
details see the dmsetup(8) man page.</p>

<p>The mount-point argument is the pathname of the
directory where the filesystem is mounted. The filesystem
must be mounted to be frozen (see mount(8)).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Print help and exit.</p>

<p>-f, --freeze This option requests the specified a
filesystem to be frozen from new modifications. When this is
selected, all ongoing transactions in the filesystem are
allowed to complete, new write system calls are halted,
other calls which modify the filesystem are halted, and all
dirty data, metadata, and log information are written to
disk. Any process attempting to write to the frozen
filesystem will block waiting for the filesystem to be
unfrozen.</p>

<p>Note that even after freezing, the on-disk filesystem
can con- tain information on files that are still in the
process of unlinking. These files will not be unlinked until
the filesys- tem is unfrozen or a clean mount of the
snapshot is complete.</p>

<p>-u, --unfreeze This option is used to un-freeze the
filesystem and allow opera- tions to continue. Any
filesystem modifications that were blocked by the freeze are
unblocked and allowed to complete.</p>

<p>NOTES This man page based on xfs_freeze. One of -f or -u
must be supplied to fsfreeze.</p>
