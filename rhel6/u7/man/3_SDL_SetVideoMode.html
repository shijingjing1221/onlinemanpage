<p>SDL_SetVideoMode(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_SetVideoMode(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_SetVideoMode - Set up a video mode with the
specified width, height and bits-per-pixel.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &quot;SDL.h&quot;</p>

<p>SDL_Surface *SDL_SetVideoMode(int width, int height, int
bpp, Uint32 flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Set up a video mode with the specified
width, height and bits-per- pixel.</p>

<p>If bpp is 0, it is treated as the current display bits
per pixel.</p>

<p>The flags parameter is the same as the flags field of
the SDL_Surface structure. OR d combinations of the
following values are valid.</p>

<p>SDL_SWSURFACE Create the video surface in system
memory</p>

<p>SDL_HWSURFACE Create the video surface in video
memory</p>

<p>SDL_ASYNCBLIT Enables the use of asynchronous updates of
the dis- play surface. This will usually slow down blitting
on single CPU machines, but may provide a speed increase on
SMP systems.</p>

<p>SDL_ANYFORMAT Normally, if a video surface of the
requested bits- per-pixel (bpp) is not available, SDL will
emulate one with a shadow surface. Passing SDL_ANYFORMAT
prevents this and causes SDL to use the video sur- face,
regardless of its pixel depth.</p>

<p>SDL_HWPALETTE Give SDL exclusive palette access. Without
this flag you may not always get the the colors you request
with SDL_SetColors or SDL_SetPalette.</p>

<p>SDL_DOUBLEBUF Enable hardware double buffering; only
valid with SDL_HWSURFACE. Calling SDL_Flip will flip the
buffers and update the screen. All drawing will take place
on the surface that is not displayed at the moment. If
double buffering could not be enabled then SDL_Flip will
just perform a SDL_UpdateRect on the entire screen.</p>

<p>SDL_FULLSCREEN SDL will attempt to use a fullscreen
mode. If a hardware resolution change is not possible (for
whatever reason), the next higher resolution will be used
and the display window centered on a black background.</p>

<p>SDL_OPENGL Create an OpenGL rendering context. You
should have previously set OpenGL video attributes with
SDL_GL_SetAttribute.</p>

<p>SDL_OPENGLBLIT Create an OpenGL rendering context, like
above, but allow normal blitting operations. The screen (2D)
surface may have an alpha channel, and SDL_UpdateRects must
be used for updating changes to the screen surface.</p>

<p>SDL_RESIZABLE Create a resizable window. When the window
is resized by the user a SDL_VIDEORESIZE event is gen-
erated and SDL_SetVideoMode can be called again with the new
size.</p>

<p>SDL_NOFRAME If possible, SDL_NOFRAME causes SDL to
create a window with no title bar or frame decoration.
Fullscreen modes automatically have this flag set.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Whatever flags SDL_SetVideoMode could satisfy are set in
the flags member of the returned surface.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>The bpp parameter is the number of bits per pixel, so a
bpp of 24 uses the packed representation of 3 bytes/pixel.
For the more common 4 bytes/pixel mode, use a bpp of 32.
Somewhat oddly, both 15 and 16 will request a 2 bytes/pixel
mode, but different pixel formats.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The framebuffer surface, or NULL if it
fails. The surface returned is freed by SDL_Quit() and
should nt be freed by the caller.</p>
