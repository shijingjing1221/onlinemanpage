<p>Tcl_Main(3) Tcl Library Procedures Tcl_Main(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_Main, Tcl_SetMainLoop - main program and event
loop definition for Tcl-based applications</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Main(argc, argv, appInitProc)</p>

<p>Tcl_SetMainLoop(mainLoopProc)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int argc (in) Number of elements in argv.</p>

<p>char *argv[] (in) Array of strings contain- ing
command-line argu- ments.</p>

<p>Tcl_AppInitProc *appInitProc (in) Address of an
application- specific initialization procedure. The value
for this argument is usually Tcl_AppInit.</p>

<p>Tcl_MainLoopProc *mainLoopProc (in) Address of an
application- specific event loop proce- dure.

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_Main can serve as the main program for
Tcl-based shell applica- tions. A shell application is a
program like tclsh or wish that sup- ports both interactive
interpretation of Tcl and evaluation of a script contained
in a file given as a command line argument. Tcl_Main is
offered as a convenience to developers of shell
applications, so they do not have to reproduce all of the
code for proper initialization of the Tcl library and
interactive shell operation. Other styles of embedding Tcl
in an application are not supported by Tcl_Main. Those must
be achieved by calling lower level functions in the Tcl
library directly.</p>

<p>The Tcl_Main function has been offered by the Tcl
library since release Tcl 7.4. In older releases of Tcl, the
Tcl library itself defined a function main, but that lacks
flexibility of embedding style and having a function main in
a library (particularly a shared library) causes problems on
many systems. Having main in the Tcl library would also make
it hard to use Tcl in C++ programs, since C++ programs must
have special C++ main functions.</p>

<p>Normally each shell application contains a small main
function that does nothing but invoke Tcl_Main. Tcl_Main
then does all the work of creating and running a tclsh-like
application.</p>

<p>Tcl_Main is not provided by the public interface of Tcls
stub library. Programs that call Tcl_Main must be linked
against the standard Tcl library. Extensions (stub-enabled
or not) are not intended to call Tcl_Main.</p>

<p>Tcl_Main is not thread-safe. It should only be called by
a single mas- ter thread of a multi-threaded application.
This restriction is not a problem with normal use described
above.</p>

<p>Tcl_Main and therefore all applications based upon it,
like tclsh, use Tcl_GetStdChannel to initialize the standard
channels to their default values. See Tcl_StandardChannels
for more information.</p>

<p>Tcl_Main supports two modes of operation, depending on
the values of argc and argv. If the first few arguments in
argv match ?-encoding name? fileName, where fileName does
not begin with the character -, then fileName is taken to be
the name of a file containing a startup script, and name is
taken to be the name of the encoding of the con- tents of
that file, which Tcl_Main will attempt to evaluate. Other-
wise, Tcl_Main will enter an interactive mode.</p>

<p>In either mode, Tcl_Main will define in its master
interpreter the Tcl variables argc, argv, argv0, and
tcl_interactive, as described in the documentation for
tclsh.</p>

<p>When it has finished its own initialization, but before
it processes commands, Tcl_Main calls the procedure given by
the appInitProc argu- ment. This procedure provides a hook
for the application to perform its own initialization of the
interpreter created by Tcl_Main, such as defining
application-specific commands. The procedure must have an
interface that matches the type Tcl_AppInitProc: typedef int
Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp);</p>

<p>AppInitProc is almost always a pointer to Tcl_AppInit;
for more details on this procedure, see the documentation
for Tcl_AppInit.</p>

<p>When the appInitProc is finished, Tcl_Main enters one of
its two modes. If a startup script has been provided,
Tcl_Main attempts to evaluate it. Otherwise, interactive
mode begins with examination of the vari- able
tcl_rcFileName in the master interpreter. If that variable
exists and holds the name of a readable file, the contents
of that file are evaluated in the master interpreter. Then
interactive operations begin, with prompts and command
evaluation results written to the stan- dard output channel,
and commands read from the standard input channel and then
evaluated. The prompts written to the standard output
channel may be customized by defining the Tcl variables
tcl_prompt1 and tcl_prompt2 as described in the
documentation for tclsh. The prompts and command evaluation
results are written to the standard output chan- nel only if
the Tcl variable tcl_interactive in the master interpreter
holds a non-zero integer value.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetMainLoop allows setting an event loop procedure
to be run. This allows, for example, Tk to be dynamically
loaded and set its event loop. The event loop will run
following the startup script. If you are in interactive
mode, setting the main loop procedure will cause the prompt
to become fileevent based and then the loop procedure is
called. When the loop procedure returns in interactive mode,
interactive opera- tion will continue. The main loop
procedure must have an interface that matches the type
Tcl_MainLoopProc: typedef void Tcl_MainLoopProc(void);</p>

<p>Tcl_Main does not return. Normally a program based on
Tcl_Main will terminate when the exit command is evaluated.
In interactive mode, if an EOF or channel error is
encountered on the standard input channel, then Tcl_Main
itself will evaluate the exit command after the main loop
procedure (if any) returns. In non-interactive mode, after
Tcl_Main evaluates the startup script, and the main loop
procedure (if any) returns, Tcl_Main will also evaluate the
exit command.</p>
