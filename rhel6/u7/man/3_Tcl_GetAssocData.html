<p>Tcl_SetAssocData(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_SetAssocData(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_GetAssocData, Tcl_SetAssocData,
Tcl_DeleteAssocData - manage asso- ciations of string keys
and user specified data with Tcl interpreters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>ClientData Tcl_GetAssocData(interp, key, delProcPtr)</p>

<p>Tcl_SetAssocData(interp, key, delProc, clientData)</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteAssocData(interp, key)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
to execute the specified command.</p>

<p>const char *key (in) Key for association with which to
store data or from which to delete or retrieve data.
Typically the module prefix for a package.</p>

<p>Tcl_InterpDeleteProc *delProc (in) Procedure to call
when interp is deleted.</p>

<p>Tcl_InterpDeleteProc **delProcPtr (in) Pointer to
location in which to store address of current deletion
procedure for associa- tion. Ignored if NULL.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary one-word value
associated with the given key in this interpreter. This data
is owned by the caller.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures allow extensions to
associate their own data with a Tcl interpreter. An
association consists of a string key, typically the name of
the extension, and a one-word value, which is typically a
pointer to a data structure holding data specific to the
extension. Tcl makes no interpretation of either the key or
the value for an asso- ciation.</p>

<p>Storage management is facilitated by storing with each
association a procedure to call when the interpreter is
deleted. This procedure can dispose of the storage occupied
by the clients data in any way it sees fit.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetAssocData creates an association between a string
key and a user specified datum in the given interpreter. If
there is already an asso- ciation with the given key,
Tcl_SetAssocData overwrites it with the new information. It
is up to callers to organize their use of names to avoid
conflicts, for example, by using package names as the keys.
If the deleteProc argument is non-NULL it specifies the
address of a pro- cedure to invoke if the interpreter is
deleted before the association is deleted. DeleteProc should
have arguments and result that match the type
Tcl_InterpDeleteProc: typedef void Tcl_InterpDeleteProc(
ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp *interp); When deleteProc
is invoked the clientData and interp arguments will be the
same as the corresponding arguments passed to
Tcl_SetAssocData. The deletion procedure will not be invoked
if the association is deleted before the interpreter is
deleted.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetAssocData returns the datum stored in the
association with the specified key in the given interpreter,
and if the delProcPtr field is non-NULL, the address
indicated by it gets the address of the delete procedure
stored with this association. If no association with the
specified key exists in the given interpreter
Tcl_GetAssocData returns NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_DeleteAssocData deletes an association with a
specified key in the given interpreter. Then it calls the
deletion procedure.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS association, data, deletion procedure,
interpreter, key</p>
