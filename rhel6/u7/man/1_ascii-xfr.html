<p>NAME ascii-xfr - upload/download files using the ASCII
protocol</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ascii-xfr -s|-r [-ednv] [-l linedelay] [-c
characterdelay] filename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ascii-xfr Transfers files in ASCII mode.
This means no flow control, no checksumming and no file-name
negotiation. It should only be used if the remote system
doesnt understand anything else.</p>

<p>The ASCII protocol transfers files line-by-line. The EOL
(End-Of-Line) character is transmitted as CRLF. When
receiving, the CR character is stripped from the incoming
file. The Control-Z (ASCII 26) character signals
End-Of-File, if option -e is specified (unless you change it
to Cotrol-D (ASCII 4) with -d).</p>

<p>Ascii-xfr reads from stdin when receiving, and sends
data on stdout when sending. Some form of input or output
redirection to the modem device is thus needed when
downloading or uploading, respectively.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s Send a file.</p>

<p>-r Receive a file. One of -s or -r must be present.</p>

<p>-e Send the End-Of-File character (Control-Z, ASCII 26
by default) when uploading has finished.</p>

<p>-d Use the Control-D (ASCII 4) as End-Of-File
character.</p>

<p>-n Do not translate CR to CRLF and vice versa.</p>

<p>-v Verbose: show tranfer statistics on the stderr
output.</p>

<p>-l milliseconds When transmitting, pause for this delay
after each line.</p>

<p>-c milliseconds When transmitting, pause for this delay
after each character.</p>

<p>file Name of the file to send or receive. When
receiving, any exist- ing file by this name will be
truncated.</p>

<p>USAGE WITH MINICOM If you want to call this program from
minicom(1), start minicom and go to the Options menu. Select
