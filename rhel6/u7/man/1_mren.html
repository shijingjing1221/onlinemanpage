<p>Name mren - rename an existing MSDOS file</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mren command is used to rename or move
an existing MS-DOS file or subdirectory. Its syntax is:</p>

<p>mren [-voOsSrRA] sourcefile targetfile</p>

<p>Mren renames an existing file on an MS-DOS
filesystem.</p>

<p>In verbose mode, Mren displays the new filename if the
name supplied is invalid.</p>

<p>If the first syntax is used (only one sourcefile), and
if the target name doesn t contain any slashes or colons,
the file (or subdirectory) is renamed in the same directory,
instead of being moved to the current mcd directory as would
be the case with mmove. Unlike the MS-DOS ver- sion of REN,
mren can be used to rename directories.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
