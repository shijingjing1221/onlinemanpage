<p>virt-list-filesystems(1) Virtualization Support
virt-list-filesystems(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-list-filesystems - List filesystems in a
virtual machine or disk image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-list-filesystems [--options] domname</p>

<p>virt-list-filesystems [--options] disk.img [disk.img
...]</p>

<p>OBSOLETE This tool is obsolete. Use virt-filesystems(1)
as a more flexible replacement.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-list-filesystems&quot; is a
command line tool to list the filesystems that are contained
in a virtual machine or disk image.</p>

<p>&quot;virt-list-filesystems&quot; is just a simple
wrapper around libguestfs(3) functionality. For more complex
cases you should look at the guestfish(1) tool.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>--version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-c URI --connect URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>If you specify guest block devices directly, then
libvirt is not used at all.</p>

<p>--format raw Specify the format of disk images given on
the command line. If this is omitted then the format is
autodetected from the content of the disk image.</p>

<p>If disk images are requested from libvirt, then this
program asks libvirt for this information. In this case, the
value of the format parameter is ignored.</p>

<p>If working with untrusted raw-format guest disk images,
you should ensure the format is always specified.</p>

<p>-l --long With this option,
&quot;virt-list-filesystems&quot; displays the type of each
filesystem too (where &quot;type&quot; means
&quot;ext3&quot;, &quot;xfs&quot; etc.)</p>

<p>-a --all Normally we only show mountable filesystems. If
this option is given then swap devices are shown too.</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>
