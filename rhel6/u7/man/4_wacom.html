<p>NAME wacom - Wacom input driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;idevname&quot; Driver &quot;wacom&quot; Option
&quot;Device&quot; &quot;devpath&quot; ... EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION wacom is an X input driver for Wacom
devices.</p>

<p>The wacom driver functions as a pointer input
device.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE This driver supports the Wacom IV and
Wacom V protocols. Serial tablets only need this driver. USB
tablet support is available on some Linux platforms and
requires the wacom kernel driver being loaded before this
driver starts.</p>

<p>Please check http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net for
latest updates of Wacom X and kernel drivers.</p>

<p>DRIVER-INTERNAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING When input device
hotplugging in the X server is enabled and no Input- Device
section exists for a compatible tablet device and an
InputClass section (see xorg.conf.d(5x)) assigns this driver
for the device, the wacom driver creates multiple X devices
for each a physical device, one X device for each available
tool. The list of tools is hardware-depen- dent. See Option
Type as outlined in the CONFIGURATION DETAILS section.</p>

<p>These tool-specific devices are referred to as parent
device and depen- dent device. The parent device is the one
presented by the system and the one that causes the X server
to load the wacom driver. This parent device then causes the
automatic addition of several dependent devices. If the
parent device is unplugged or otherwise removed, the
dependent devices will be automatically removed as well.</p>

<p>Dependent devices may be assigned tool-specific options
through addi- tional InputClass sections. We recommend that
a MatchDriver wacom line is used in these sections in
addition to the user-specific pattern.</p>

<p>Match directives are applied by the X server before the
driver is selected. The type name of the parent device is
appended by the driver. It is not possible to use a
MatchProduct directive to match against this appended type
name.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) or
xorg.conf.d(5x) for general configura- tion details and for
options that can be used with all input drivers. This
section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.</p>

<p>Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit.
Each device sup- ports the following entries:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Type&quot;
&quot;stylus&quot;|&quot;eraser&quot;|&quot;cursor&quot;|&quot;pad&quot;|&quot;touch&quot;
sets the type of tool the device represents. This option is
mandatory. The core options, such as
&quot;SendCoreEvents&quot; or &quot;AlwaysCore&quot;, are
unnecessary in Gimp if you dont need to move system cursor
outside of Gimp drawing area. &quot;pad&quot; is for Intuos
3 or Cintiq 21UX tablet ExpressKeys/menu strips, and
Graphire 4 or Bamboo tablet buttons, wheel, and/or ring. It
is required for Intuos3, CintiqV5, Graphire 4, and Bamboo if
you want to use keystroke features. &quot;pad&quot; is
reported as a second tool in the driver. &quot;touch&quot;
is for the tablet with touch support. Right now only a few
Tablet PCs have this feature.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Device&quot; &quot;path&quot; sets the path
to the special file which represents serial line where the
tablet is plugged. You have to specify it for each
subsection with the same value if you want to have multiple
devices with the same tablet. This option is mandatory.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Suppress&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
position increment under which not to transmit coordinates.
This entry must be specified only in the first Wacom
subsection if you have multiple devices for one tablet. If
you dont specify this entry, the default value, which is 2,
will be used. To disable suppression, the entry should be
specified as 0. When suppress is defined, an event will be
sent only when at least one of the following conditions is
met:</p>

<p>the change between the current X coordinate and the
previous one is greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current Y coordinate and the
previous one is greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current pressure and the previous
one is greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current degree of rotation and
the previous one of the transducer is greater than sup-
press;</p>

<p>the change between the current absolute wheel value and
the previous one is equal to or greater than suppress;</p>

<p>the change between the current tilt value and the
previous one is equal to or greater than suppress (if tilt
is supported);</p>

<p>relative wheel value has changed;</p>

<p>button value has changed;</p>

<p>proximity has changed.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Mode&quot;
&quot;Relative&quot;|&quot;Absolute&quot; sets the mode of
the device. The default value for stylus, pad and eraser is
Absolute; cursor is Relative; touch defaults to Relative for
tablets with touch pads and Abso- lute for touch
screens.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TopX&quot; &quot;number&quot; X coordinate
of the top corner of the active zone. Default to 0.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TopY&quot; &quot;number&quot; Y coordinate
of the top corner of the active zone. Default to 0.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BottomX&quot; &quot;number&quot; X
coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone. Default
to width of the tablet.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BottomY&quot; &quot;number&quot; Y
coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone. Default
to height of the tablet.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ButtonsOnly&quot;
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; disables the devices motion
events. Default to off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ButtonM&quot; &quot;AC&quot; reports an
action AC when button M is pressed, where M is one of the
device supported button numbers, it can be 1 to 32. Wacom
uses a driver-internal button mapping, where any physical
button appears to the X server as the button specified by
the ButtonM mapping. Hence, if two physical buttons have the
same ButtonM mapping, the server will think they are the
same physical button. The default action reported to the X
server is mouse button M click. Because X uses buttons 4, 5,
6, and 7 as the four scrolling directions, physical buttons
4 and higher are mapped to 8 and higher by default. To
ignore the button click, i.e., to not report any button
click event to the X server, use &quot;0&quot; or
&quot;button 0&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TPCButton&quot;
&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot; enables the stylus buttons as
Tablet PC buttons. If enabled, the stylus reports button
events only when its tip is pressed. If any button is down,
pressing the tip reports a button event for the button.
Otherwise if no button is down, the tip reports as usual.
Default to &quot;on&quot; for Tablet PCs; &quot;off&quot;
for all other models. Only available on the sty- lus
tool.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Touch&quot; &quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;
enables touch events for touch devices, i.e., system cur-
sor moves when user touches the tablet. Default to
&quot;on&quot; for devices that support touch;
&quot;off&quot; for all other models.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot;
&quot;CW&quot;|&quot;CCW&quot;|&quot;HALF&quot;|&quot;NONE&quot;
rotates the tablet orientation counterclockwise (CCW) or
clockwise (CW) or 180 degrees (HALF). If you have specific
tablet mappings, i.e. TopX/Y or BottomX/Y were set, the
mapping will be applied before rotation. Rotation must be
applied to the parent device (usually the stylus), rotation
settings on in-driver hotplugged devices (see DRIVER-INTER-
NAL DEVICE HOTPLUGGING ) will be ignored. The default is
&quot;NONE&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PressCurve&quot; &quot;x1,y1,x2,y2&quot;
sets pressure curve by control points x1, y1, x2, and y2.
Their values are in range from 0..100. The pressure curve is
interpreted as Bezier curve with 4 control points, the first
and the last control point being fixed on the coordi- nates
0/0 and 100/100, respectively. The middle control points are
adjustible by this setting and thus define the shape of the
curve. The input for linear curve (default) is
&quot;0,0,100,100&quot;; slightly depressed curve (firmer)
might be &quot;5,0,100,95&quot;; slightly raised curve
(softer) might be &quot;0,5,95,100&quot;. The pressure curve
is only applicable to devices of type stylus or eraser,
other devices do not honor this setting.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugLevel&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets
the level of debugging info for tool-specific mes- sages.
There are 12 levels, specified by the integers between 1 and
12. All debug messages with a level less than or equal to
the &quot;number&quot; will be logged into the Xorg log
file. This option is only available if the driver was built
with debugging support.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CommonDBG&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
level of debugging info for common (i.e. not tool- specific)
code paths on the tablet. There are 12 levels, specified by
the integers between 1 and 12. All debug mes- sages with a
level less than or equal to the &quot;number&quot; will be
logged into the Xorg log file. This option is only available
if the driver was built with debugging support.</p>

<p>Option &quot;GrabDevice&quot; &quot;bool&quot; sets
whether the underlying event device will be grabbed by the
driver to prevent the data from leaking to /dev/input/mice.
When enabled, while the X server is run- ning, no other
programs will be able to read the event stream. Default:
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CursorProx&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets
the max distance from tablet to stop reporting move- ment
for the cursor. Default for Intuos series is 10, for
Graphire series (including Volitos) is 42. Only available
for the cursor/puck device.</p>

<p>Option &quot;RawSample&quot; &quot;number&quot; Set the
sample window size (a sliding average sampling window) for
incoming input tool raw data points. Default: 4, range of 1
to 20.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Serial&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
serial number associated with the physical device. This
allows to have multiple devices of the same type (i.e.
multiple pens). This option is only available on wacom V
devices (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U). To see which serial
number belongs to a device, you need to run the utility
program, xsetwacom, which comes with linuxwacom package.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ToolSerials&quot;
&quot;number[,type[,label]][;...]&quot; sets the list of
serial numbered devices that need to be hotplugged for a
physical device. The type option may be any of
&quot;pen&quot;, &quot;airbrush&quot;, &quot;artpen&quot;,
or &quot;cursor&quot;. This option is only available on
wacom V devices (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U). To see which
serial number belongs to a device, you need to run the
utility program, xsetwacom, that comes with this driver.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Threshold&quot; &quot;number&quot; sets the
pressure threshold used to generate a button 1 events of
stylus. The threshold applies to the normalised pressure
range of [0..2048]. The default is 27.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Gesture&quot; &quot;bool&quot; Enable or
disable multi-finger in-driver gesture support on the
device. Default: off unless the tablet supports multi-
touch. Note that disabling this option may allow the desk-
top environment to detect multi-finger gestures instead.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZoomDistance&quot; &quot;number&quot; If
Option &quot;Gesture&quot; is enabled, this option specifies
the minimum movement distance before a zoom gesture is
recog- nized.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ScrollDistance&quot; &quot;number&quot; If
Option &quot;Gesture&quot; is enabled, this option specifies
the minimum movement distance before a scroll gesture is
recog- nized.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TapTime&quot; &quot;number&quot; If Option
&quot;Gesture&quot; is enabled, this option determines the
maximum time of a touch event to be recognized as tap. A
press and release event shorter than TapTime generates but-
ton press and release events. Presses longer than TapTime do
not generate button events, only motion events.</p>

<p>TOUCH GESTURES Single finger (1FG) Left click: tap,
actual click happens after TapTime period elapses.</p>

<p>Left click drag: tap to select, quickly (within TapTime
period) touch selection again. Then drag. Available on
touchpads, e.g. BambooPT, not touchscreens.</p>

<p>Two finger (2FG) Right click: one finger down + tap
second finger</p>

<p>Vertical scroll: two fingers side by side (in any
orientation) moving vertically with constant separation
initiates a vertical scroll. By driver default a gesture up
results in a scroll down event (the docu- ment moves up) and
a gesture down results in a scroll up event (moving the
document down).</p>

<p>Horizontal scroll: two fingers side by side held at a
constant distance moving horizontally initiates a horizontal
scroll. A gesture to the left results in a scroll right
event (the document moves left) and a gesture right results
in a scroll left event (moving the document right).</p>

<p>Zoom in: two separated fingers side by side, bring
together i.e. pinch.</p>

<p>Zoom out: two fingers side by side, spread. Not all
applications sup- port zoom.</p>
