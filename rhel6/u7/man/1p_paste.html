<p>PASTE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PASTE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME paste - merge corresponding or subsequent lines of
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS paste [-s][-d list] file...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The paste utility shall concatenate the
corresponding lines of the given input files, and write the
resulting lines to standard output.</p>

<p>The default operation of paste shall concatenate the
corresponding lines of the input files. The &lt;newline&gt;
of every line except the line from the last input file shall
be replaced with a &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>If an end-of-file condition is detected on one or more
input files, but not all input files, paste shall behave as
though empty lines were read from the files on which
end-of-file was detected, unless the -s option is
specified.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The paste utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-d list Unless a backslash character appears in list,
each character in list is an element specifying a delimiter
character. If a back- slash character appears in list, the
backslash character and one or more characters following it
are an element specifying a delimiter character as described
below. These elements specify one or more delimiters to use,
instead of the default &lt;tab&gt;, to replace the
&lt;newline&gt; of the input lines. The elements in list
shall be used circularly; that is, when the list is
exhausted the first element from the list is reused. When
the -s option is specified:</p>

<p>* The last &lt;newline&gt; in a file shall not be
modified.</p>

<p>* The delimiter shall be reset to the first element of
list after each file operand is processed.</p>

<p>When the -s option is not specified:</p>

<p>* The &lt;newline&gt;s in the file specified by the last
file operand shall not be modified.</p>

<p>* The delimiter shall be reset to the first element of
list each time a line is processed from each file.</p>

<p>If a backslash character appears in list, it and the
character follow- ing it shall be used to represent the
following delimiter characters:</p>

<p>n &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>t &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>\ Backslash character.</p>

<p>0 Empty string (not a null character). If 0 is
immediately fol- lowed by the character, the character X ,
or any character defined by the LC_CTYPE digit keyword (see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
7, Locale), the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>If any other characters follow the backslash, the
results are unspeci- fied.</p>

<p>-s Concatenate all of the lines of each separate input
file in com- mand line order. The &lt;newline&gt; of every
line except the last line in each input file shall be
replaced with the &lt;tab&gt;, unless otherwise specified by
the -d option.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If-is specified for
one or more of the files, the standard input shall be used;
the standard input shall be read one line at a time,
circularly, for each instance of - . Implementations shall
support pasting of at least 12 file operands.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if one or
more file operands is -. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files, except
that line lengths shall be unlimited.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of paste:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Concatenated lines of input files shall be
separated by the &lt;tab&gt; (or other characters under the
control of the -d option) and terminated by a
&lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If one or more input files cannot
be opened when the -s option is not specified, a diagnostic
message shall be written to standard error, but no output is
written to standard output. If the -s option is specified,
the paste utility shall provide the default behavior
described in Util- ity Description Defaults .</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE When the escape sequences of the list
option-argument are used in a shell script, they must be
quoted; otherwise, the shell treats the as a special
character.</p>

<p>Conforming applications should only use the specific
backslash escaped delimiters presented in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. Historical implementations trea,
wherexis not in this list, as, but future implementations
are free to expand this list to recognize other common
escapes similar to those accepted by printf and other
standard utilities.</p>

<p>Most of the standard utilities work on text files. The
cut utility can be used to turn files with arbitrary line
lengths into a set of text files containing the same data.
The paste utility can be used to create (or recreate) files
with arbitrary line lengths. For example, if file contains
long lines:</p>

<p>cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1 cut -b 501- -n file &gt;
file2</p>

<p>creates file1 (a text file) with lines no longer than
500 bytes (plus the &lt;newline&gt;) and file2 that contains
the remainder of the data from file. Note that file2 is not
a text file if there are lines in file that are longer than
500 + {LINE_MAX} bytes. The original file can be recreated
from file1 and file2 using the command:</p>

<p>paste -d 0&quot; file1 file2 &gt; file</p>

<p>The commands:</p>

<p>paste -d 0&quot; ... paste -d &quot;&quot; ...</p>

<p>are not necessarily equivalent; the latter is not
specified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 and may
result in an error. The con- struc0is used to mean &quot;no
separator&quot; because historical versions of paste did not
follow the syntax guidelines, and the command:</p>

<p>paste -d&quot;&quot; ...</p>

<p>could not be handled properly by getopt().</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Write out a directory in four columns:</p>

<p>ls | paste - - - -</p>

<p>2. Combine pairs of lines from a file into single
lines:</p>

<p>paste -s -d n&quot; file</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
