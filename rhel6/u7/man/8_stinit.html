<p>NAME stinit - initialize SCSI magnetic tape drives</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS stinit [-f conf-file] [-h] [-p] [-r] [-v]
[devices...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the tape control
program stinit can used to initialize SCSI tape drive modes
at system startup, after loading the tape driver as module,
or after introduction of new device to the SCSI subsystem at
run-time. The initialization is performed by sending ioctl
commands to the drive. The commands are defined in a text
file that is indexed using the inquiry data the drive
returns (manufacturer, device, revision). Values for all of
the general and mode-specific SCSI tape parameters up to
Linux version 2.6.0 can be initialized.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f conf-file Specifies the name of the text file
containing the definitions for different tape drive types.
By default stinit tries to find the definition file
stinit.def or /etc/stinit.def (in this order).</p>

<p>-h Print the usage information.</p>

<p>-p The definition file is parsed but no tape drive
initialization is attempted. This option can be used for
testing the integrity of a definition file after changes
have been made.</p>

<p>-r Rewind every device being initialized.</p>

<p>-v The more -v options (currently up to two), the more
verbose out- put.</p>

<p>--version Print the program version.</p>

<p>THE DEVICES BEING INITIALIZED If the program is started
without arguments, it tries to find all accessible SCSI tape
devices and the device files for the different modes of the
devices. The tape drives are searched in the scanning order
of the kernel and searching is stopped at the first
non-existing tape. All of the found devices are initialized
if a matching descrip- tion is found from the parameter
file. Note that a mode for a device is not initialized if
the corresponding device file is not found even if a
matching description for the mode exists. The non-rewind
device is pre- ferred over the auto-rewind device for each
mode. If the directory /dev/tapes is found, the devfs
filesystem is assumed to be mounted on /dev. Otherwise, the
directories /dev/scsi and /dev are scanned for device
files.</p>

<p>SCSI tape drives can be initialized selectively using
program argu- ments. A numeric argument specifies the number
of the tape drive in the scanning order of the kernel. A
file name specifies that the device corresponding to this
name is to be initialized. If the file name is given without
the directory specification, the program searches for the
name in the device directories /dev/scsi and /dev. Only full
path names are supported with devfs.</p>

<p>THE CONFIGURATION FILE The configuration file is a
simple text file that contains descriptions of tape drives
and the corresponding initialization parameters. The
parameter definition blocks are delimited by {}.
Specification of the drive description is restarted after
each parameter definition block.</p>

<p>The drive descriptions and the parameter definitions
consist of pairs name = value. The value is either a numeric
parameter, a string not containing blanks, or a quoted
string. In case of a numeric parameter, the postfix k or M
can be used to give the value in units of 1024 or 1024 *
1024, respectively. If the =value -part is omitted, the
value &quot;1&quot; is used. If the character # is found
from an input line, the rest of the line is discarded. This
allows use of comments in the definition file. The following
example contains definitions for one type of tape
drives:</p>

<p># The XY dat manufacturer=XY-COMPANY model = &quot;UVW
DRIVE&quot; { scsi2logical=1 # Common definitions for all
modes can-bsr can-partitions auto-lock # Definition of modes
mode1 blocksize=0 compression=1 mode2 blocksize=1024
compression=1 mode3 blocksize=0 compression=0 mode4
blocksize = 1k compression=0 }</p>

<p>The devices are identified using zero or more of the
following keywords corresponding to the data returned by the
tape device as response to the SCSI INQUIRY command. The
matches are case-sensitive and performed up to the length
defined in the configuration file (permitting use of partial
matches).</p>

<p>manufacturer= This keyword specifies the string that
must match the vendor identification returned by the
device.</p>

<p>model= This keyword defines the string that must match
the product identification returned by the device.</p>

<p>revision= This keyword matched the string that must
match the product revision level returned by the device.</p>

<p>All of the matching initializations are collected in the
order they are defined in the file. This means that common
parameters can be defined for all devices using zero
keywords for a definition block. Another consequence is
that, for instance, some parameters can be easily given
different values for a specific firmware revision without
repeating the parameters common to all revisions.</p>

<p>The tape parameters are defined using the following
keywords. More thorough description of the parameters can be
found from the st(4) man page (not up to date when this is
written) or from the file drivers/scsi/README.st in the
Linux kernel source tree. The keywords are matched using
only the first characters. The part of the keywords not used
in matching is enclosed by []. The numeric values may be
spec- ified either in decimal notation or hexadecimal
notation (using the prefix 0x).</p>

<p>drive-[buffering]=value The drives buffering parameter
is set to value. This parameter if common for all modes.</p>

<p>cleaning The cleaning request notifying parameter is set
to value</p>

<p>no-w[ait] The immediate mode is used with commands like
rewind if value is non-zero (i.e., the driver does not wait
for the command to fin- ish).</p>

<p>mode=value This keyword starts definition of tape mode
value. The number of the mode must be between 1 and 4.</p>

<p>disab[led]=value This mode is disabled for this device
if value is non-zero. Can be used if some mode defined in a
more general definition should be disabled by a more
specific definition for some device (for example, for a
device with buggy firmware level).</p>

<p>block[size]=value The default tape block size is set to
value. bytes. The block size zero means variable block
mode.</p>

<p>dens[ity]=value The tape density code is set to
value.</p>

<p>buff[ering]=value The buffered writes by the driver in
fixed block mode are enabled if value is non-zero.</p>

<p>async[-writes]=value Asynchronous writes by the driver
are enabled if value is non- zero.</p>

<p>read[-ahead]=value Read-ahead by the driver in fixed
block mode is allowed if value is non-zero.</p>

<p>two[-fms]=value Two filemarks are written when a file
being written to is closed if value is non-zero. By default,
one filemark is written.</p>

<p>comp[ression]=value Compression of the data by the drive
is enabled if value is non- zero. Note that the tape driver
can t enable compression for all drives that can compress
data. Note also that some drives define compression using
density codes.</p>

<p>auto[-lock]=value The tape drive door is locked
automatically when the device file is opened if value is
non-zero.</p>

<p>fast[-eom]=value The MTEOM command is performed using
the SCSI command that spaces directly to the end of medium
if value is non-zero. The drawback is that the file number
in the status becomes invalid. By default, spacing to end of
medium is performed by spacing over filemarks until end of
medium is detected and the file num- ber remains valid.</p>

<p>can-b[sr]=value Backspacing over records is used by the
driver when reposition- ing the tape when read-ahead is
enabled if value is non-zero.</p>

<p>noblk[limits]=value The tape driver does not use the
READ BLOCK LIMITS SCSI command when the device is being
opened if value is non-zero. This is for the drives that do
not support this SCSI command.</p>

<p>can-p[artitions]=value The support for tape partitions
is enabled if value is non-zero.</p>

<p>scsi2[logical]=value Logical block addresses are used in
the MTSEEK and MTIOCPOS com- mands if value is non-zero. The
default is to use the device- specific addresses.</p>

<p>sili=value If value is non-zero, the SILI bit is set
when reading in vari- able block mode. This may speed up
reading blocks shorter than the read byte count. Set this
only if you know that the drive supports SILI and the HBA
reliably returns transfer residual byte counts. Requires
kernel version &gt;= 2.6.26.</p>

<p>defs-for-w[rites]=value The parameters defining the tape
format (density, block size, etc.) are forced when writing
starts at the beginning of a tape if value is non-zero. The
default is to change there parameters each time the device
is opened at the beginning of a tape (or the mode is changed
in the middle of a tape).</p>

<p>sysv=value The System V tape semantics are used if value
is non-zero. Oth- erwise the BSD semantics are used.</p>

<p>timeout=value The normal timeout for the device is set
to value seconds.</p>

<p>long-time[out]=value The long timeout for the device is
set to value seconds.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The program exits with value one if the
command line is incorrect, the definition file is not found,
or option -p is given and parsing the definition file fails.
In all other cases the return value is zero (i.e., failing
of initialization is not currently signaled by the return
value).</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS With the exception of the -p option, the
program can be used only by the superuser. This is because
the program uses ioctls allowed only for the superuser.</p>
