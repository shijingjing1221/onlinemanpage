<p>DISCARD(8) DISCARD(8)</p>

<p>NAME discard - Postfix discard mail delivery agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS discard [generic Postfix daemon options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix discard(8) delivery agent
processes delivery requests from the queue manager. Each
request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain
or host name that is treated as the reason for dis- carding
the mail, and recipient information. The reason may be pre-
fixed with an RFC 3463-compatible detail code. This program
expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.</p>

<p>The discard(8) delivery agent pretends to deliver all
recipients in the delivery request, logs the
&quot;next-hop&quot; domain or host information as the
reason for discarding the mail, updates the queue file and
marks recip- ients as finished or informs the queue manager
that delivery should be tried again at a later time.</p>

<p>Delivery status reports are sent to the trace(8) daemon
as appropriate.</p>

<p>SECURITY The discard(8) mailer is not
security-sensitive. It does not talk to the network, and can
be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.</p>

<p>STANDARDS None.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Problems and transactions are logged to
syslogd(8).</p>

<p>Depending on the setting of the notify_classes
parameter, the postmas- ter is notified of bounces and of
other trouble.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS Changes to main.cf are picked
up automatically as discard(8) processes run for only a
limited amount of time. Use the command &quot;postfix
reload&quot; to speed up a change.</p>

<p>The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
postconf(5) for more details including examples.</p>

<p>config_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The default
location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf con-
figuration files.</p>

<p>daemon_timeout (18000s) How much time a Postfix daemon
process may take to handle a request before it is terminated
by a built-in watchdog timer.</p>

<p>delay_logging_resolution_limit (2) The maximal number of
digits after the decimal point when log- ging sub-second
delay values.</p>

<p>double_bounce_sender (double-bounce) The sender address
of postmaster notifications that are gener- ated by the mail
system.</p>

<p>ipc_timeout (3600s) The time limit for sending or
receiving information over an internal communication
channel.</p>

<p>max_idle (100s) The maximum amount of time that an idle
Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection
before terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>max_use (100) The maximal number of incoming connections
that a Postfix daemon process will service before
terminating voluntarily.</p>

<p>process_id (read-only) The process ID of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>process_name (read-only) The process name of a Postfix
command or daemon process.</p>

<p>queue_directory (seepostconf -doutput) The location of
the Postfix top-level queue directory.</p>

<p>syslog_facility (mail) The syslog facility of Postfix
logging.</p>

<p>syslog_name (seepostconf -doutput) The mail system name
