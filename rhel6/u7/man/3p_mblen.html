<p>MBLEN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual MBLEN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME mblen - get number of bytes in a character</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int mblen(const char *s, size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If s is not a null pointer, mblen() shall
determine the number of bytes constituting the character
pointed to by s. Except that the shift state of mbtowc() is
not affected, it shall be equivalent to:</p>

<p>mbtowc((wchar_t *)0, s, n);</p>

<p>The implementation shall behave as if no function
defined in this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 calls
mblen().</p>

<p>The behavior of this function is affected by the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. For a
state-dependent encoding, this function shall be placed into
its initial state by a call for which its character pointer
argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s as
other than a null pointer shall cause the internal state of
the func- tion to be altered as necessary. A call with s as
a null pointer shall cause this function to return a
non-zero value if encodings have state dependency, and 0
otherwise. If the implementation employs special bytes to
change the shift state, these bytes shall not produce
separate wide-character codes, but shall be grouped with an
adjacent character. Changing the LC_CTYPE category causes
the shift state of this function to be unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If s is a null pointer, mblen() shall
return a non-zero or 0 value, if character encodings,
respectively, do or do not have state-dependent encodings.
If s is not a null pointer, mblen() shall either return 0
(if s points to the null byte), or return the number of
bytes that con- stitute the character (if the next n or
fewer bytes form a valid char- acter), or return -1 (if they
do not form a valid character) and may set errno to indicate
the error. In no case shall the value returned be greater
than n or the value of the {MB_CUR_MAX} macro.</p>

<p>ERRORS The mblen() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ Invalid character sequence is detected.</p>
