<p>STRUCT USB_DEVICE_DR(9) Host-Side Data Types and Macro
STRUCT USB_DEVICE_DR(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_usb_device_driver - identifies USB device
driver to usbcore</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct usb_device_driver { const char * name;
int (* probe) (struct usb_device *udev); void (* disconnect)
(struct usb_device *udev); int (* suspend) (struct
usb_device *udev, pm_message_t message); int (* resume)
(struct usb_device *udev, pm_message_t message); struct
usbdrv_wrap drvwrap; unsigned int supports_autosuspend:1;
};</p>

<p>MEMBERS name The driver name should be unique among USB
drivers, and should normally be the same as the module
name.</p>

<p>probe Called to see if the driver is willing to manage a
particular device. If it is, probe returns zero and uses
dev_set_drvdata to associate driver-specific data with the
device. If unwilling to manage the device, return a negative
errno value.</p>

<p>disconnect Called when the device is no longer
accessible, usually because it has been (or is being)
disconnected or the driver&acute;s module is being
unloaded.</p>

<p>suspend Called when the device is going to be suspended
by the system.</p>

<p>resume Called when the device is being resumed by the
system.</p>

<p>drvwrap Driver-model core structure wrapper.</p>

<p>supports_autosuspend if set to 0, the USB core will not
allow autosuspend for devices bound to this driver.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION USB drivers must provide all the fields
listed above except drvwrap.</p>
