<p>NAME psed - a stream editor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS psed [-an] script [file ...] psed [-an] [-e
script] [-f script-file] [file ...]</p>

<p>s2p [-an] [-e script] [-f script-file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A stream editor reads the input stream
consisting of the specified files (or standard input, if
none are given), processes is line by line by applying a
script consisting of edit commands, and writes resulting
lines to standard output. The filename &quot;-&quot; may be
used to read standard input.</p>

<p>The edit script is composed from arguments of -e options
and script- files, in the given order. A single script
argument may be specified as the first parameter.</p>

<p>If this program is invoked with the name s2p, it will
act as a sed-to- Perl translator. See &quot;sed Script
Translation&quot;.</p>

<p>sed returns an exit code of 0 on success or &gt;0 if an
error occurred.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a A file specified as argument to the w edit
command is by default opened before input processing starts.
Using -a, opening of such files is delayed until the first
line is actually written to the file.</p>

<p>-e script The editing commands defined by script are
appended to the script. Multiple commands must be separated
by newlines.</p>

<p>-f script-file Editing commands from the specified
script-file are read and appended to the script.</p>

<p>-n By default, a line is written to standard output
after the editing script has been applied to it. The -n
option suppresses automatic printing.</p>

<p>COMMANDS sed command syntax is defined as</p>

<p>[address[,address]][!]function[argument]</p>

<p>with whitespace being permitted before or after
addresses, and between the function character and the
argument. The addresses and the address inverter
(&quot;!&quot;) are used to restrict the application of a
command to the selected line(s) of input.</p>

<p>Each command must be on a line of its own, except where
noted in the synopses below.</p>

<p>The edit cycle performed on each input line consist of
reading the line (without its trailing newline character)
into the pattern space, applying the applicable commands of
the edit script, writing the final contents of the pattern
space and a newline to the standard output. A hold space is
provided for saving the contents of the pattern space for
later use.</p>

<p>Addresses A sed address is either a line number or a
pattern, which may be combined arbitrarily to construct
ranges. Lines are numbered across all input files.</p>

<p>Any address may be followed by an exclamation mark
(&quot;!&quot; ), selecting all lines not matching that
address.</p>

<p>number The line with the given number is selected.</p>

<p>$ A dollar sign (&quot;$&quot;) is the line number of
the last line of the input stream.</p>

<p>/regular expression/ A pattern address is a basic
regular expression (see &quot;Basic Regular
Expressions&quot;), between the delimiting character
&quot;/&quot;. Any other character except &quot; address
when the initial delimiter is prefixed with a backslash
(&quot;</p>

<p>If no address is given, the command selects every
line.</p>

<p>If one address is given, it selects the line (or lines)
matching the address.</p>

<p>Two addresses select a range that begins whenever the
first address matches, and ends (including that line) when
the second address matches. If the first (second) address is
a matching pattern, the second address is not applied to the
very same line to determine the end of the range. Likewise,
if the second address is a matching pattern, the first
address is not applied to the very same line to determine
the begin of another range. If both addresses are line
numbers, and the second line number is less than the first
line number, then only the first line is selected.</p>

<p>Functions The maximum permitted number of addresses is
indicated with each function synopsis below.</p>

<p>The argument text consists of one or more lines
following the command. Embedded newlines in text must be
preceded with a backslash. Other backslashes in text are
deleted and the following character is taken literally.</p>

<p>[1addr]atext Write text (which must start on the line
following the command) to standard output immediately before
reading the next line of input, either by executing the N
function or by beginning a new cycle.</p>

<p>[2addr]b [label] Branch to the : function with the
specified label. If no label is given, branch to the end of
the script.</p>

<p>[2addr]ctext The line, or range of lines, selected by
the address is deleted. The text (which must start on the
line following the command) is written to standard output.
With an address range, this occurs at the end of the
range.</p>

<p>[2addr]d Deletes the pattern space and starts the next
cycle.</p>

<p>[2addr]D Deletes the pattern space through the first
embedded newline or to the end. If the pattern space becomes
empty, a new cycle is started, otherwise execution of the
script is restarted.</p>

<p>[2addr]g Replace the contents of the pattern space with
the hold space.</p>

<p>[2addr]G Append a newline and the contents of the hold
space to the pattern space.</p>

<p>[2addr]h Replace the contents of the hold space with the
pattern space.</p>

<p>[2addr]H Append a newline and the contents of the
pattern space to the hold space.</p>

<p>[1addr]itext Write the text (which must start on the
line following the command) to standard output.</p>

<p>[2addr]l Print the contents of the pattern space:
non-printable characters are shown in C-style escaped form;
long lines are split and have a trailing &quot; , , , marked
with a &quot;$&quot;. Escapes are: , , 0 \ for BEL, HT, LF,
FF, CR, ESC, respectively, and followed by a three-digit
octal number for all other non-printable characters.</p>

<p>[2addr]n If automatic printing is enabled, write the
pattern space to the standard output. Replace the pattern
space with the next line of input. If there is no more
input, processing is terminated.</p>

<p>[2addr]N Append a newline and the next line of input to
the pattern space. If there is no more input, processing is
terminated.</p>

<p>[2addr]p Print the pattern space to the standard output.
(Use the -n option to suppress automatic printing at the end
of a cycle if you want to avoid double printing of
lines.)</p>

<p>[2addr]P Prints the pattern space through the first
embedded newline or to the end.</p>

<p>[1addr]q Branch to the end of the script and quit
without starting a new cycle.</p>

<p>[1addr]r file Copy the contents of the file to standard
output immediately before the next attempt to read a line of
input. Any error encountered while reading file is silently
ignored.</p>

<p>[2addr]s/regular expression/replacement/flags Substitute
the replacement string for the first substring in the
pattern space that matches the regular expression. Any
character other than backslash or newline can be used
instead of a slash to delimit the regular expression and the
replacement. To use the delimiter as a literal character
within the regular expression and the replacement, precede
the character by a backslash (&quot;</p>

<p>Literal newlines may be embedded in the replacement
string by preceding a newline with a backslash.</p>

<p>Within the replacement, an ampersand (&quot;&amp;&quot;)
is replaced by the string matching the regular expression.
The strings &quot;1&quot; through &quot;9&quot; are replaced
by the corresponding subpattern (see &quot;Basic Regular
Expressions&quot;). To get a literal &quot;&amp;&quot; or
&quot; replacement text, precede it by a backslash.</p>

<p>The following flags modify the behaviour of the s
command:</p>

<p>g The replacement is performed for all matching, non-
overlapping substrings of the pattern space.</p>

<p>1..9 Replace only the n-th matching substring of the
pattern space.</p>

<p>p If the substitution was made, print the new value of
the pattern space.</p>

<p>w file If the substitution was made, write the new value
of the pattern space to the specified file.</p>

<p>[2addr]t [label] Branch to the : function with the
specified label if any s substitutions have been made since
the most recent reading of an input line or execution of a t
function. If no label is given, branch to the end of the
script.</p>

<p>[2addr]w file The contents of the pattern space are
written to the file.</p>

<p>[2addr]x Swap the contents of the pattern space and the
hold space.</p>

<p>[2addr]y/string1/string2/ In the pattern space, replace
all characters occuring in string1 by the character at the
corresponding position in string2. It is possible to use any
character (other than a backslash or newline) instead of a
slash to delimit the strings. Within string1 and string2, a
backslash followed by any character other than a newline is
that literal character, and a backslash followed by an n is
replaced by a newline character.</p>

<p>[1addr]= Prints the current line number on the standard
output.</p>

<p>[0addr]: [label] The command specifies the position of
the label. It has no other effect.</p>

<p>[2addr]{ [command] [0addr]} These two commands begin and
end a command list. The first command may be given on the
same line as the opening { command. The commands within the
list are jointly selected by the address(es) given on the {
command (but may still have individual addresses).</p>

<p>[0addr]# [comment] The entire line is ignored (treated
as a comment). If, however, the first two characters in the
script are &quot;#n&quot;, automatic printing of output is
suppressed, as if the -n option were given on the command
line.</p>

<p>BASIC REGULAR EXPRESSIONS A Basic Regular Expression
(BRE), as defined in POSIX 1003.2, consists of atoms, for
matching parts of a string, and bounds, specifying
repetitions of a preceding atom.</p>

<p>Atoms The possible atoms of a BRE are: ., matching any
single character; ^ and $, matching the null string at the
beginning or end of a string, respectively; a bracket
expressions, enclosed in [ and ] (see below); and any single
character with no other significance (matching that
character). A before one of: ., ^, $, [, *, matching the
character after the backslash. A sequence of atoms enclosed
in( an) becomes an atom and establishes the target for a
backreference, consisting of the substring that actually
matches the enclosed atoms. Finally, followed by one of the
digits 0 through 9 is a backreference.</p>

<p>A ^ that is not first, or a $ that is not last does not
have a special significance and need not be preceded by a
backslash to become literal. The same is true for a ], that
does not terminate a bracket expression.</p>

<p>An unescaped backslash cannot be last in a BRE.</p>

<p>Bounds The BRE bounds are: *, specifying 0 or more
matches of the preceding atom;{coun}, specifying that many
repetitions;{minimum}, giving a lower limit;
an{minimum,maximu} finally defines a lower and upper
bound.</p>

<p>A bound appearing as the first item in a BRE is taken
literally.</p>

<p>Bracket Expressions A bracket expression is a list of
characters, character ranges and character classes enclosed
in [ and ] and matches any single character from the
represented set of characters.</p>

<p>A character range is written as two characters separated
by - and represents all characters (according to the
character collating sequence) that are not less than the
first and not greater than the second. (Ranges are very
collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should
avoid relying on them.)</p>

<p>A character class is one of the class names</p>

<p>alnum digit punct alpha graph space blank lower upper
cntrl print xdigit</p>

<p>enclosed in [: and :] and represents the set of
characters as defined in ctype(3).</p>

<p>If the first character after [ is ^, the sense of
matching is inverted.</p>

<p>To include a literal &quot;^&quot; , place it anywhere
else but first. To include a literal &quot;]&quot; place it
first or immediately after an initial ^. To include a
literal &quot;-&quot; make it the first (or second after ^)
or last character, or the second endpoint of a range.</p>

<p>The special bracket expression constructs
&quot;[[:&lt;:]]&quot; and &quot;[[:&gt;:]]&quot; match the
null string at the beginning and end of a word respectively.
(Note a t o that neither is identical to Perls m . )</p>

<p>Additional Atoms Since some sed implementations provide
additional regular expression atoms (not defined in POSIX
1003.2), psed is capable of translating the following
backslash escapes:</p>

<p>&lt; This is the same as &quot;[[:&gt;:]]&quot;. &gt;
This is the same as &quot;[[:&lt;:]]&quot;. 1080 W This is
an abbreviation for &quot;[^[:alnum:]_]&quot;. y Match the
empty string at a word boundary. 0 characters.</p>

<p>To enable this feature, the environment variable
PSEDEXTBRE must be set to a string containing the requested
characters, e.g.:
&quot;PSEDEXTBRE=&rsquo;&lt;&gt;wW&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable
&quot;PSEDEXTBRE&quot; may be set to extend BREs. See
&quot;Additional Atoms&quot;.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS ambiguous translation for character %s in y
command The indicated character appears twice, with
different translations.</p>

<p>[ cannot be last in pattern A [ in a BRE indicates the
beginning of a bracket expression.</p>

<p>cannot be last in pattern A in a BRE is used to make the
subsequent character literal.</p>

<p>cannot be last in substitution A in a subsitution string
is used to make the subsequent character literal.</p>

<p>conflicting flags %s In an s command, either the g flag
and an n-th occurrence flag, or multiple n-th occurrence
flags are specified. Note that only the digits 1 through 9
are permitted.</p>

<p>duplicate label %s (first defined at %s) excess
address(es) The command has more than the permitted number
of addresses.</p>

<p>extra characters after command (%s) illegal option %s
improper delimiter in s command The BRE and substitution may
not be delimited with or newline.</p>

<p>invalid address after , invalid backreference (%s) The
specified backreference number exceeds the number of
backreferences in the BRE.</p>

<p>invalid repeat clause %s The repeat clause does not
contain a valid integer value, or pair of values.</p>

<p>malformed regex, 1st address malformed regex, 2nd
address malformed regular expression malformed substitution
expression malformed y command argument The first or second
string of a y command is syntactically incorrect.</p>

<p>maximum less than minimum in %s no script command given
There must be at least one -e or one -f option specifying a
script or script file.</p>

<p>not valid as delimiter in y command option -e requires
an argument option -f requires an argument s command
requires argument start of unterminated { string lengths in
y command differ The translation table strings in a y
command must have equal lengths.</p>

<p>undefined label %s unexpected } A } command without a
preceding { command was encountered.</p>

<p>unexpected end of script The end of the script was
reached although a text line after a a, c or i command
indicated another line.</p>

<p>unknown command %s unterminated [ A BRE contains an
unterminated bracket expression.</p>

<p>unterminated A BRE contains an unterminated
backreference.</p>

<p>without closing A BRE contains an unterminated bounds
specification.</p>

<p>without preceding y command requires argument</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The basic material for the preceding section was
generated by running the sed script</p>

<p>#no autoprint s/^.*Warn( *&quot;&quot;]*&quot;.*$/1/ t
process b :process s/$!/%s/g s/$[_[:alnum:]]1,/%s/g s/\\/\/g
s/^/=item / p</p>

<p>on the programs own text, and piping the output into
&quot;sort -u&quot;.</p>

<p>SED SCRIPT TRANSLATION If this program is invoked with
the name s2p it will act as a sed-to- Perl translator. After
option processing (all other arguments are ignored), a Perl
program is printed on standard output, which will process
the input stream (as read from all arguments) in the way
defined by the sed script and the option setting used for
the translation.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO perl(1), re_format(7)</p>

<p>BUGS The l command will show escape characters (ESC) as
&quot;\&quot;, but a vertical tab (VT) in octal.</p>

<p>Trailing spaces are truncated from labels in :, t and b
commands.</p>

<p>The meaning of an empty regular expression
(&quot;//&quot;), as defined by sed, is &quot;the last
pattern used, at run time&quot;. This deviates from the Perl
interpretation, which will re-use the &quot;last last
successfully executed regular expression&quot;. Since
keeping track of pattern usage would create terribly
cluttered code, and differences would only appear in obscure
context (where other sed implementations appear to deviate,
too), the Perl semantics was adopted. Note that common usage
of this feature, such as in &quot;/abc/s//xyz/&quot;, will
work as expected.</p>

<p>Collating elements (of bracket expressions in BREs) are
not implemented.</p>

<p>STANDARDS This sed implementation conforms to the IEEE
Std1003.2-1992 (&quot;POSIX.2&quot;) definition of sed, and
is compatible with the OpenBSD implementation, except where
otherwise noted (see &quot;BUGS&quot;).</p>
