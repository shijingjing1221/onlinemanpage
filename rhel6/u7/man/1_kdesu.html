<p>KDESU(1) KDE User s Manual KDESU(1)</p>

<p>NAME kdesu - Runs a program with elevated privileges</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kdesu [-c] [-d] [-f file] [-i icon name] [-n]
[-p priority] [-r] [-s] [-t] [-u user] [--nonewdcop]
[command [arg1] [arg2] [...]]</p>

<p>kdesu [KDE Generic Options] [Qt Generic Options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION KDE su is a graphical front end for the
UNIX&reg; su command for the K Desktop Environment. It
allows you to run a program as different user by supplying
the password for that user. KDE su is an unprivileged pro-
gram; it uses the systems su.</p>

<p>KDE su has one additional feature: it can optionally
remember passwords for you. If you are using this feature,
you only need to enter the password once for each
command.</p>

<p>This program is meant to be started from the command
line or from .desktop files.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c program This specifies the program to run as
root. It has to be passed in one argument. So if, for
example, you want to start a new file manager, you would
enter at the prompt: kdesu -c kfm -sw</p>

<p>-d Show debug information.</p>

<p>-f file This option allow efficient use of KDE su in
.desktop files. It tells KDE su to examine the file
specified by file. If this file is writable by the current
user, KDE su will execute the command as the current user.
If it is not writable, the command is exe- cuted as user
user (defaults to root).</p>

<p>file is evaluated like this: if file starts with a /, it
is tak- en as an absolute filename. Otherwise, it is taken
as the name of a global KDE configuration file. For example:
to configure the K display manager, kdm, you could issue
kdesu -c kdmconfig -f kdmrc</p>

<p>-i icon name Specify icon to use in the password dialog.
You may specify just the name, without any extension.</p>

<p>-n Do not keep the password. This disables the keep
password check- box in the password dialog.</p>

<p>-p priority Set priority value. The priority is an
arbitrary number between 0 and 100, where 100 means highest
priority, and 0 means lowest. The default is 50.</p>

<p>-r Use realtime scheduling.</p>

<p>-s Stop the kdesu daemon. This is the daemon that caches
successful passwords in the background. This feature may
also be disabled with -n when KDE su is initially run.</p>

<p>-t Enable terminal output. This disables password
keeping. This is largely for debugging purposes; if you want
to run a console mode app, use the standard su instead.</p>

<p>-u user While the most common use for KDE su is to run a
command as the superuser, you can supply any user name and
the appropriate password.</p>

<p>More detailed user documentation is available from
help:/kdesu (either enter this URL into Konqueror, or run
khelpcenter help:/kdesu).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Run kfmclient as user jim, and show the
Konqueror icon in the password dialog:</p>

<p>kdesu -u jim -i konqueror kfmclient</p>
