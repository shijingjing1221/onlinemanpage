<p>SIEVEC(1) Pigeonhole SIEVEC(1)</p>

<p>NAME sievec - Pigeonhole&rsquo;s Sieve script
compiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sievec [options] script-file [out-file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sieve-dump command is part of the
Pigeonhole Project (pigeon- hole(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC
5228) support to the Dovecot secure IMAP and POP3 server
(dovecot(1)).</p>

<p>Using the sievec command, Sieve scripts can be compiled
into a binary representation. The resulting binary can be
used directly to process e-mail messages during the delivery
process. The delivery of mail mes- sages and - by means of
the LDA Sieve plugin - also the execution of Sieve scripts
is performed by Dovecotqs local delivery agent (LDA) called
dovecot-lda(1). Usually, it is not necessaryto compile the
Sieve script manually using sievec, because dovecot-lda will
do this automatically if the binary is missing. However, in
some cases dove- cot-lda does not have permission to write
the compiled binary to disk, forcing it to recompile the
script every time it is executed. Using the sievec tool,
this can be performed manually by an authorized user to
increase performance.</p>

<p>The Pigeonhole Sieve implementation recognizes files
with a .sieve extension as Sieve scripts and corresponding
files with a .svbin exten- sion as the associated compiled
binary. This means for example that Dovecot&rsquo;s LDA
process will first look for a binary file
&quot;dovecot.svbin&quot; when it needs to execute
&quot;dovecot.sieve&quot;. It will compile a new binary when
it is missing.</p>

<p>The sievec command is also useful to verify Sieve
scripts before using. Additionally, with the -d option it
can output a textual (and thus human-readable) dump of the
generated Sieve code to the specified file. The output is
then identical to what the sieve-dump(1) command produces
for a stored binary file. This output is mainly useful to
find bugs in the compiler that yield corrupt binaries.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c config-file Alternative Dovecot configuration
file path.</p>

<p>-d Don&rsquo;t write the binary to out-file, but write a
textual dump of the binary instead. In this context, the
out-file value - has special meaning: it causes the the
textual dump to be written to stdout. The out-file argument
may also be omitted, which has the same effect as -. The
output is identical to what the sieve-dump(1) command
produces for a compiled Sieve binary file. Note that this
option is not allowed when the out-file argument is a
directory.</p>

<p>-x extensions Set the available extensions. The
parameter is a space-separated list of the active
extensions. By prepending the extension iden- tifiers with +
or -, extensions can be included or excluded rel- ative to
the default set of extensions. If no extensions have a + or
- prefix, only those extensions that are explicitly listed
will be enabled. Unknown extensions are ignored and a
warning is produced. By default, all supported extensions
are available, except for deprecated extensions or those
that are still under development.</p>

<p>For example -x &quot;+imapflags -enotify&quot; will
enable the deprecated imapflags extension along with all
extensions that are available by default, except for the
enotify extension.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS script-file Specifies the script to be
compiled. If the script-file argument is a directory, all
files in that directory with a .sieve exten- sion are
compiled into a corresponding .svbin binary file. The
compilation is not halted upon errors; it attempts to
compile as many scripts in the directory as possible. Note
that the -d option and the out-file argument are not allowed
when the script-file argument is a directory.</p>

<p>out-file Specifies where the (binary) output is to be
written. This argu- ment is optional. If omitted a binary
compiled from &lt;script- name&gt;.sieve is saved as
&lt;scriptname&gt;.svbin. If -b is specified, the binary
dump is output to stdout.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS sievec will exit with one of the following
values:</p>

<p>0 Delivery was successful. (EX_OK, EXIT_SUCCES)</p>

<p>1 Operation failed. This is returned for almost all
failures. (EXIT_FAILURE)</p>

<p>64 Invalid parameter given. (EX_USAGE)</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
Dovecot&rsquo;s main configuration file.</p>

<p>/usr/local/etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf Sieve
interpreter settings (included from Dovecot&rsquo;s main
config- uration file)</p>

output, to the Dovecot Mailing List
