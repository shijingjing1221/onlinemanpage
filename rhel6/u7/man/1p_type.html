<p>TYPE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TYPE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME type - write a description of command type</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS type name...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The type utility shall indicate how each
argument would be interpreted if used as a command name.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>name A name to be interpreted.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of type:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>PATH Determine the location of name, as described in the
Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter
8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The standard output of type contains information
about each operand in an unspecified format. The information
provided typically identifies the operand as a shell
built-in, function, alias, or keyword, and where applicable,
may display the operands pathname.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since type must be aware of the
contents of the current shell execution environment (such as
the lists of commands, functions, and built-ins processed by
hash), it is always provided as a shell regular built-in. If
it is called in a separate utility execution environment,
such as one of the following:</p>

<p>nohup type writer find . -type f | xargs type it might
not produce accurate results.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO command, hash</p>
