helper.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS umount.ecryptfs_private [-f]</p>

<p>NOTE: This program will not clear the relevant keys from
the users keyring. For this reason, it is recommended that

<p>-f Force the unmount, ignoring the value of the mount
counter in /tmp/ecryptfs-USERNAME-Private</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION umount.ecryptfs_private is a mount helper
utility for non-root users, who ares members of ecryptfs
group, to unmount a cryptographically mounted private
directory, ~/Private.</p>

<p>If, and only if: - the private mount passphrase is in
their kernel keyring, and - the current user owns both
~/.Private and ~/Private, and - ~/.Private is currently
mounted on ~/Private - the mount counter is 0 (counter is
ignored if -f option is used)</p>

<p>This program will: - unmount ~/Private</p>

<p>The only setuid operationis in this program are the call
to umount and updating /etc/mtab.</p>

<p>The system administrator can add the pam_ecryptfs.so
module to the PAM stack and automatically perform the
unmount on logout. See pam_ecryptfs(8).</p>

encrypted data</p>

<p>~/Private - mountpoint containing decrypted data (when
mounted)</p>

mountpoint passphrase</p>

mount counter, incremented on each mount, decremented on
each unmount</p>
