<p>STRCPY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual STRCPY(3)</p>

<p>NAME strcpy, strncpy - copy a string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);</p>

<p>char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t
n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strcpy() function copies the string
pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte
(&rsquo; &rsquo;), to the buffer pointed to by dest. The
strings may not overlap, and the destination string dest
must be large enough to receive the copy.</p>

<p>The strncpy() function is similar, except that at most n
bytes of src are copied. Warning: If there is no null byte
among the first n bytes of src, the string placed in dest
will not be null terminated.</p>

<p>If the length of src is less than n, strncpy() pads the
remainder of dest with null bytes.</p>

<p>A simple implementation of strncpy() might be:</p>

<p>char* strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n){
size_t i;</p>

<p>for (i = 0 ; i &lt; n &amp;&amp; src[i] != &rsquo;
&rsquo; ; i++) dest[i] = src[i]; for ( ; i &lt; n ; i++)
dest[i] = &rsquo; &rsquo;;</p>

<p>return dest; }</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The strcpy() and strncpy() functions return
a pointer to the destina- tion string dest.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.</p>

<p>NOTES Some programmers consider strncpy() to be
inefficient and error prone. If the programmer knows (i.e.,
includes code to test!) that the size of dest is greater
than the length of src, then strcpy() can be used.</p>

<p>If there is no terminating null byte in the first n
characters of src, strncpy() produces an unterminated string
in dest. Programmers often prevent this mistake by forcing
termination as follows:</p>

<p>strncpy(buf, str, n); if (n &gt; 0) buf[n - 1]= &rsquo;
&rsquo;;</p>

<p>BUGS If the destination string of a strcpy() is not
large enough, then any- thing might happen. Overflowing
fixed-length string buffers is a favorite cracker technique
for taking complete control of the machine. Any time a
program reads or copies data into a buffer, the program
first needs to check that theres enough space. This may be
unneces- sary if you can show that overflow is impossible,
but be careful: pro- grams can get changed over time, in
ways that may make the impossible possible.</p>
