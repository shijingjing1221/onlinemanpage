<p>NAME XmClipboardRetrieve A clipboard function that
retrieves a data item from the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardRetrieve (display, window, format_name, buffer,
length, num_bytes, private_id) Display * display; Window
window; char * format_name; XtPointer buffer; unsigned long
length; unsigned long * num_bytes; long * private_id;
(void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardRetrieve retrieves the current
data item from clipboard storage. It returns a warning if
the clipboard is locked, if there is no data on the
clipboard, or if the data needs to be truncated because the
buffer length is too short.</p>

<p>Between a call to XmClipboardStartRetrieve and a call to
XmClipboardEn- dRetrieve, multiple calls to
XmClipboardRetrieve with the same format name result in data
being incrementally copied from the clipboard until the data
in that format has all been copied.</p>

<p>The return value XmClipboardTruncate from calls to
XmClipboardRetrieve indicates that more data remains to be
copied in the given format. It is recommended that any calls
to the Inquire functions that the appli- cation needs to
make to effect the copy from the clipboard be made between
the call to XmClipboardStartRetrieve and the first call to
XmClipboardRetrieve. This way, the application does not need
to call XmClipboardLock and XmClipboardUnlock.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies the window ID of a widget that relates
the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>format_name Specifies the name of a format in which the
data is stored on the clipboard.</p>

<p>buffer Specifies the buffer to which the application
wants the clip- board to copy the data. The function
allocates space to hold the data returned into the buffer.
The application is responsible for managing this allocated
space. The applica- tion can recover this allocated space by
calling XtFree.</p>

<p>length Specifies the length of the application
buffer.</p>

<p>num_bytes Specifies the number of bytes of data copied
into the appli- cation buffer.</p>

<p>private_id Specifies the private data stored with the
data item by the application that placed the data item on
the clipboard. If the application did not store private data
with the data item, this argument returns 0 (zero).</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardTruncate The data returned is truncated
because the user did not pro- vide a buffer large enough to
hold the data.</p>

<p>XmClipboardNoData The function could not find data on
the clipboard correspond- ing to the format requested. This
could occur because the clipboard is empty; there is data on
the clipboard but not in the requested format; or the data
in the requested format was passed by name and is no longer
available.</p>

<p>RELATED XmClipboardEndRetrieve(3), XmClipboardLock(3),
XmClipboardStartCopy(3), XmClipboardStartRetrieve(3), and
XmClipboardUnlock(3).</p>
