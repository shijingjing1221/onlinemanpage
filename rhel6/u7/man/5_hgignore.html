<p>NAME hgignore - syntax for Mercurial ignore files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS The Mercurial system uses a file called
.hgignore in the root directory of a repository to control
its behavior when it searches for files that it is not
currently tracking.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The working directory of a Mercurial
repository will often contain files that should not be
tracked by Mercurial. These include backup files created by
editors and build products created by compilers. These files
can be ignored by listing them in a .hgignore file in the
root of the working directory. The .hgignore file must be
created manu- ally. It is typically put under version
control, so that the settings will propagate to other
repositories with push and pull.</p>

<p>An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the
repository root directory, or any prefix path of that path,
is matched against any pattern in .hgignore.</p>

<p>For example, say we have an untracked file, file.c, at
a/b/file.c inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore
file.c if any pattern in .hgignore matches a/b/file.c, a/b
or a.</p>

<p>In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can
reference a set of per-user or global ignore files. See the
hgrc(5) man page for details of how to configure these
files. Look for the &quot;ignore&quot; entry in the
&quot;ui&quot; section.</p>

<p>To control Mercurial&rsquo;s handling of files that it
manages, see the hg(1) man page. Look for the -I and -X
options.</p>

<p>SYNTAX An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of
a list of patterns, with one pattern per line. Empty lines
are skipped. The # character is treated as a comment
character, and the character is treated as an escape
character.</p>

<p>Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default
syntax used is Python/Perl-style regular expressions.</p>

<p>To change the syntax used, use a line of the following
form:</p>

<p>syntax: NAME</p>

<p>where NAME is one of the following:</p>

<p>regexp</p>

<p>Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.</p>

<p>glob</p>

<p>Shell-style glob.</p>

<p>The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all
patterns that fol- low, until another syntax is
selected.</p>

<p>Neither glob nor regexp patterns are rooted. A
glob-syntax pattern of the form *.c will match a file ending
in .c in any directory, and a regexp pattern of the form.c$
will do the same. To root a regexp pattern, start it with
^.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Here is an example ignore file.</p>

<p># use glob syntax. syntax: glob</p>

<p>*.elc *.pyc *~</p>

<p># switch to regexp syntax. syntax: regexp ^.pc/</p>
