<p>CHDIR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CHDIR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME chdir - change working directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int chdir(const char *path);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The chdir() function shall cause the
directory named by the pathname pointed to by the path
argument to become the current working direc- tory; that is,
the starting point for path searches for pathnames not
beginning with/.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, the current
working directory shall remain unchanged, and errno shall be
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The chdir() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Search permission is denied for any component of
the pathname.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
directory or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the pathname is not a
directory.</p>

<p>The chdir() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Changing the Current Working Directory The
following example makes the value pointed to by directory,
/tmp, the current working directory.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; ... char *directory =
&quot;/tmp&quot;; int ret;</p>

<p>ret = chdir (directory);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The chdir() function only affects the working
directory of the current process.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
