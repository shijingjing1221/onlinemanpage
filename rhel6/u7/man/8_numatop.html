<p>NAME numatop - a tool for memory access locality
characterization and analy- sis.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS numatop [-s] [-l] [-f] [-d]</p>

<p>numatop [-h]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page briefly documents the
numatop command.</p>

<p>Most modern systems use a Non-Uniform Memory Access
(NUMA) design for multiprocessing. In NUMA systems, memory
and processors are organized in such a way that some parts
of memory are closer to a given proces- sor, while other
parts are farther from it. A processor can access mem- ory
that is closer to it much faster than the memory that is
farther from it. Hence, the latency between the processors
and different por- tions of the memory in a NUMA machine may
be significantly different.</p>

<p>numatop is an observation tool for runtime memory
locality characteri- zation and analysis of processes and
threads running on a NUMA system. It helps the user to
characterize the NUMA behavior of processes and threads and
to identify where the NUMA-related performance bottlenecks
reside. The tool uses Intel performance counter sampling
technologies and associates the performance data with Linux
system runtime informa- tion to provide real-time analysis
in production systems. The tool can be used to:</p>

<p>A) Characterize the locality of all running processes
and threads to identify those with the poorest locality in
the system.</p>

<p>B) Identify the &quot;hot&quot; memory areas, report
average memory access latency, and provide the location
where accessed memory is allocated. A &quot;hot&quot; memory
area is where process/thread(s) accesses are most fre-
quent. numatop has a metric called &quot;ACCESS%&quot; that
specifies what per- centage of memory accesses are
attributable to each memory area.</p>

<p>Note: numatop records only the memory accesses which
have latencies greater than a predefined threshold (128 CPU
cycles).</p>

<p>C) Provide the call-chain(s) in the process/thread code
that accesses a given hot memory area.</p>

<p>D) Provide the call-chain(s) when the process/thread
generates certain counter events (RMA/LMA/IR/CYCLE). The
call-chain(s) helps to locate the source code that generates
the events.</p>

<p>RMA: Remote Memory Access. LMA: Local Memory Access. IR:
Instruction Retired. CYCLE: CPU cycles.</p>

<p>E) Provide per-node statistics for memory and CPU
utilization. A node is: a region of memory in which every
byte has the same distance from each CPU.</p>

<p>F) Show, using a user-friendly interface, the list of
processes/threads sorted by some metrics (by default, sorted
by CPU utilization), with the top process having the highest
CPU utilization in the system and the bottom one having the
lowest CPU utilization. Users can also use hotkeys to resort
the output by these metrics: RMA, LMA, RMA/LMA, CPI, and
CPU%.</p>

<p>RMA/LMA: ratio of RMA/LMA. CPI: CPU cycle per
instruction. CPU%: CPU utilization.</p>

<p>numatop is a GUI tool that periodically tracks and
analyzes the NUMA activity of processes and threads and
displays useful metrics. Users can scroll up/down by using
the up or down key to navigate in the cur- rent window and
can use several hot keys shown at the bottom of the window,
to switch between windows or to change the running state of
the tool. For example, hotkey R refreshes the data in the
current win- dow.</p>

<p>Below is a detailed description of the various display
windows and the data items that they display:</p>

<p>[WIN1 - Monitoring processes and threads]: Get the
locality characterization of all processes. This is the
first window upon startup, its numatop s &quot;Home&quot;
window. This window displays a list of processes. The top
process has the highest system CPU uti- lization (CPU%),
while the bottom process has the lowest CPU% in the system.
Generally, the memory-intensive process is also
CPU-intensive, so the processes shown in this window are
sorted by CPU% by default. The user can press hotkeys 1, 2,
3, 4, or 5 to resort the output by &quot;RMA&quot;,
&quot;LMA&quot;, &quot;RMA/LMA&quot;, &quot;CPI&quot;, or
&quot;CPU%&quot;.</p>

<p>[KEY METRICS]: RMA(K): number of Remote Memory Access
(unit is 1000). RMA(K) = RMA / 1000; LMA(K): number of Local
Memory Access (unit is 1000). LMA(K) = LMA / 1000; RMA/LMA:

system CPU utilization (busy time across all CPUs).</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported by
numatop:</p>

<p>-s sampling_precision normal: balance precision and
overhead (default) high: high sampling precision (high
overhead) low: low sampling precision, suitable for high
load system</p>

<p>-l log_level Specifies the level of logging in the log
file. Valid values are: 1: unknown (reserved for future use)
2: all</p>

<p>-f log_file Specifies the log file where output will be
written. If the log file is not writable, the tool will
prompt &quot;Cannot open &lt;file name&gt; for writ-
ting.&quot;.</p>

<p>-d dump_file Specifies the dump file where the screen
data will be written. Gener- ally the dump file is used for
automated test. If the dump file is not writable, the tool
will prompt &quot;Cannot open &lt;file name&gt; for dump
writ- ing.&quot;</p>

<p>-h Displays the commands usage.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Example 1: Launch numatop with high sampling
precision numatop -s high</p>

<p>Example 2: Write all warning messages in
/tmp/numatop.log numatop -l 2 -o /tmp/numatop.log</p>

<p>Example 3: Dump screen data in /tmp/dump.log numatop -d
/tmp/dump.log</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0: successful operation. Other value: an
error occurred.</p>

<p>USAGE You must have root privileges to run numatop. Or
set -1 in /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</p>

<p>Note: The perf_event_paranoid setting has security
implications and a non-root user probably doesnt have
authority to access /proc. It is highly recommended that the
user runs numatop as root.</p>

<p>VERSION numatop requires a patch set to support PEBS
Load Latency functionality in the kernel. The patch set has
not been integrated in 3.8. Probably it will be integrated
in 3.9. The following steps show how to get and apply the
patch set.</p>

<p>1. git clone
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git 2.
cd tip 3. git checkout perf/x86 4. build kernel as usual</p>

<p>numatop supports the Intel Xeon processors: 5500-series,
6500/7500-series, 5600 series, E7-x8xx-series, and
E5-16xx/24xx/26xx/46xx-series. Note: CPU microcode version
0x618 or 0x70c or later is required on
E5-16xx/24xx/26xx/46xx-series.</p>
