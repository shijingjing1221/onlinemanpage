<p>NAME pnmtotiffcmyk - convert a Netpbm image into a CMYK
encoded TIFF file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmtotiffcmyk [-none|-packbits|-lzw]
[-predictor n] [-msb2lsb|-lsb2msb] [-rowsperstrip n]
[-lowdotrange n] [-highdotrange n]
[-knormal|-konly|-kremove] [[-default] [-theta deg] [-gamma
n] [-gammap n] |-negative]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtotiffcmykreads a PNM image as input and produces a
CMYK encoded TIFF file as output. It optionally modifies the
color balance and black level, and modifies removal of CMY
from under K.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The order of most options is not important, but
options for particular conversion algorithms must appear
after the algorithm is selected (-default,-negative). If you
dont select an algorithm, pnmtotiffcmyk assumes -default and
the appropriate options (-theta,-gamma,-gammap) can appear
anywhere.</p>

<p>-none,-packbits,-lzw,-predictor Tiff files can be
compressed. By default, pnmtotiffcmyk uses LZW
decompression, but (apparently) some readers cannot read
this, so you may want to select a different algorithm
(-none,-packbits). For LZW compression, a -predictor value
of 2 forces horizontal differencing of scanlines before
encoding; a value of 1 forces no differencing.</p>

<p>-msb2lsb,-lsb2msb These options control fill order
(default is -msb2lsb).</p>

<p>-rowsperstrip This sets the number of rows in an image
strip (data in the Tiff files generated by this program is
stored in strips - each strip is com- pressed individually).
The default gives a strip size of no more than 8 kb.</p>

<p>-lowdotrange,-highdotrange These options set tag values
that may be useful for printers.</p>

<p>-knormal,-kremove,-konly These options control the
calculation of the CMYK ink levels. They are useful only for
testing and debugging the code.</p>

<p>-kremove sets the black (K) levels to zero while leaving
the other ink levels as they would be if the black level
were normal.</p>

<p>-konly sets all inks to the normal black value.</p>

<p>-default,-negative These options control what ink levels
pnmtotiffcmyk uses to represent each input color.</p>

<p>-negative selects a simple algorithm that generates a
color negative. None of the following options apply to this
algorithm. The algorithm is included as an example in the
source code to help implementors of other conversions.</p>

<p>-default is not necessary, unless you have to
countermand a -negative on the same command line.</p>

<p>The default conversion from RGB to CMYK is as follows:
The basic values of the 3 pigments are C = 1-R, M = 1-G, Y =
1-B. From this, pnmto- tiffcmyk chooses a black (K) level
which is the minimum of those three. It then replaces that
much of the 3 pigments with the black. I.e. it substracts K
from each of the basic C, M, and Y values.</p>

<p>The options below modify this conversion.</p>

<p>-theta deg -theta provides a simple correction for any
color bias that may occur in the printed image because, in
practice, inks do not exactly comple- ment the primary
colors. It rotates the colors (before black replace- ment)
by deg degrees in the color wheel. Unless you are trying to
pro- duce unusual effects you will need to use small values.
Try generating three images at -10, 0 (the default) and 10
degrees and see which has the best color balance.</p>

<p>-gamma n -gamma applies a gamma correction to the black
(K) value described above. Specifically, instead of
calculating the K value as min(C,M,Y), pnmtotiffcmyk raises
that value (normalised to the range 0 to 1) to the nth
power. In practice, this means that a value greater than 1
makes the image lighter and a value less than 1 makes the
image darker. The range of allowed values is 0.1 to 10.</p>

<p>-gammap n This option controls the black
replacement.</p>

<p>If you specify -gammap, pnmtotiffcmyk uses the specified
gamma value in computing how much ink to remove from the 3
pigments, but still uses the regular gamma value (-gamma
option) to generate the actual amount of black ink with
which to replace it.</p>

<p>Values of n from 0.01 to 10 are valid.</p>

<p>For example, it may be best to only subtract black from
the colored inks in the very darkest regions. In that case,
n should be a large value, such as 5.</p>

<p>As a special case, if n is -1, pnmtotiffcmyk does not
remove any pig- ment (but still adds the black ink). This
means dark areas are even darker. Furthermore, when printed,
dark areas contain a lot of ink which can make high contrast
areas, like lettering, appear fuzzy. Its hard to see what
the utility of this is.</p>
