<p>NAME amplot - visualize the behavior of Amanda</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amplot [-b] [-c] [-e] [-g] [-l] [-p] [-t T]
amdump_files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amplot reads an amdump output file that
Amanda generates each run (e.g. amdump.1) and translates the
information into a picture format that may be used to
determine how your installation is doing and if any
parameters need to be changed. Amplot also prints out amdump
lines that it either does not understand or knows to be
warning or error lines and a summary of the start, end and
total time for each backup image.</p>

<p>Amplot is a shell script that executes an awk program
(amplot.awk) to scan the amdump output file. It then
executes a gnuplot program (amplot.g) to generate the graph.
The awk program is written in an enhanced version of awk,
such as GNU awk (gawk version 2.15 or later) or nawk.</p>

<p>During execution, amplot generates a few temporary files
that gnuplot uses. These files are deleted at the end of
execution.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Generate b/w postscript file (need -p).</p>

<p>-c Compress amdump_files after plotting.</p>

<p>-e Extend the X (time) axis if needed.</p>

<p>-g Direct gnuplot output directly to the X11 display
(default).</p>

<p>-p Direct postscript output to file YYYYMMDD.ps
(opposite of -g).</p>

<p>-l Generate landscape oriented output (needs -p).</p>

<p>-t T Set the right edge of the plot to be T hours.</p>

<p>The amdump_files may be in various compressed formats
(compress, gzip, pact, compact).</p>

<p>INTERPRETATION The figure is divided into a number of
regions. There are titles on the top that show important
statistical information about the configuration and from
this execution of amdump. In the figure, the X axis is time,
with 0 being the moment amdump was started. The Y axis is
divided into 5 regions:</p>

<p>QUEUES: How many backups have not been started, how many
are waiting on space in the holding disk and how many have
been transferred successfully to tape.</p>

<p>%BANDWIDTH: Percentage of allowed network bandwidth in
use.</p>

<p>HOLDING DISK: The higher line depicts space allocated on
the holding disk to backups in progress and completed
backups waiting to be written to tape. The lower line
depicts the fraction of the holding disk containing
completed backups waiting to be written to tape including
the file currently being written to tape. The scale is
percentage of the holding disk.</p>

<p>TAPE: Tape drive usage.</p>

<p>%DUMPERS: Percentage of active dumpers.</p>

<p>The idle period at the left of the graph is time amdump
is asking the machines how much data they are going to dump.
This process can take a while if hosts are down or it takes
them a long time to generate estimates.</p>

<p>BUGS Reports lines it does not recognize, mainly error
cases but some are legitimate lines the program needs to be
taught about.</p>
