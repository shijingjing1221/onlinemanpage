<p>NAME riostream - zero-copy streaming over RDMA ping-pong
test.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS riostream [-s server_address] [-b bind_address]
[-B buffer_size] [-I iterations] [-C transfer_count] [-S
transfer_size] [-p server_port] [-T test_option]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Uses the streaming over RDMA protocol
(rsocket) to connect and exchange data between a client and
server application.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s server_address The network name or IP address
of the server system listening for connections. The used
name or address must route over an RDMA device. This option
must be specified by the client.</p>

<p>-b bind_address The local network address to bind
to.</p>

<p>-B buffer_size Indicates the size of the send and
receive network buffers.</p>

<p>-I iterations The number of times that the specified
number of messages will be exchanged between the client and
server. (default 1000)</p>

<p>-C transfer_count The number of messages to transfer
from the client to the server and back again on each
iteration. (default 1)</p>

<p>-S transfer_size The size of each send transfer, in
bytes. (default 1000) If all is specified, rstream will run
a series of tests of vari- ous sizes.</p>

<p>-p server_port The servers port number.</p>

<p>-T test_option Specifies test parameters. Available
options are:</p>

<p>a | async - uses asynchronous operation (e.g. select /
poll)</p>

<p>b | blocking - uses blocking calls</p>

<p>n | nonblocking - uses non-blocking calls</p>

<p>v | verify - verifies data transfers</p>

<p>NOTES Basic usage is to start riostream on a server
system, then run riostream -s server_name on a client
system. By default, riostream will run a series of latency
and bandwidth performance tests. Specify- ing a different
iterations, transfer_count, or transfer_size will run a user
customized test using default values where none have been
speci- fied.</p>

<p>Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace,
users must ensure that they have available system resources
and permissions. See the libibverbs README file for
additional details.</p>
