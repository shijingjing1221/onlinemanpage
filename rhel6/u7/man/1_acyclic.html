<p>NAME acyclic - make directed graph acyclic</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS acyclic [ -nv? ] [ -o outfile ] [ file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION acyclic is a filter that takes a directed
graph as input and outputs a copy of the graph with
sufficient edges reversed to make the graph acyclic. The
reversed edge inherits all of the attributes of the origi-
nal edge. The optional file argument specifies where the the
input graph is stored; by default, the program reads from
stdin.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-n No output is produced, though the return value will
indicate whether the graph is acyclic or not.</p>

<p>-v Print information about whether the file is acyclic,
has a cycle or is undirected.</p>

<p>-o outfile causes the output to be written to the
specified file; by default, output is written to stdout.</p>

<p>-? option causes the program to print usage
information.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES acyclic returns 0 if the graph is acyclic;
1 if the graph has a cycle; 2 if the graph is undirected;
and 255 if there are any errors.</p>

<p>BUGS If the graph is strict and there is a cycle of
length 2, the attributes of the reversed edge are lost.</p>

<p>Some edge attributes are non-symmetric, referring to
either the head or tail node. At present, there is no
mechanism or convention for cor- rectly switching or
renaming these.</p>
