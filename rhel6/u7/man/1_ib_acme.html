<p>NAME ib_acme - test and configuration utility for the IB
ACM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ib_acme [-f addr_format] [-s src_addr] -d
dest_addr [-v] [-c] [-P] [-S svc_addr] [-C repetitions]
ib_acme [-A [addr_file]] [-O [opt_file]] [-D dest_dir]
[-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ib_acme provides assistance configuring and
testing the ibacm service. The first usage of the service
will test that the ibacm is running and operating correctly.
The second usage model will automatically create address and
configuration files for the ibacm service.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f addr_format Specifies the format of the
src_addr and dest_addr parameters. Valid address formats
are: i ip address, n host name, l lid, g gid, and u
unspecified. If the -f option is omitted, an unspecified
address format is assumed. ib_acme will use getaddrinfo or
other mechanisms to determine which format the address
uses.</p>

<p>-s src_addr Specifies the local source address of the
path to resolve. The source address can be an IP address,
system network name, or LID, as indicated by the addr_format
option.</p>

<p>-d dest_addr Specifies the destination address of the
path to resolve. The destination address can be an IP
address, system network name, or LID, as indicated by the
addr_format option.</p>

<p>-v Indicates that the resolved path information should
be verified with the active IB SA. Use of the -v option
provides a sanity check that resolved path information is
usable given the current cluster configuration.</p>

<p>-c Instructs the ACM service to only returned
information that cur- rently resides in its local cache.</p>

<p>-P Queries performance data from the destination
service</p>

<p>-S svc_addr address of ACM service, default: local
service</p>

<p>-C repetitions number of repetitions to perform
resolution. Used to measure performance of ACM cache
lookups. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>-A [addr_file] With this option, the ib_acme utility
automatically generates the address configuration file
ibacm_addr.cfg. The generated file is constructed using the
system host name.</p>

<p>-O [opt_file] With this option, the ib_acme utility
automatically generates the option configuration file
ibacm_opts.cfg. The generated file is currently generated
using static information.</p>

<p>-D dest_dir Specify the destination directory for the
output files.</p>

<p>-V Enables verbose output. When combined with -A or -O
options, ib_acme will display additional details, such as
generated address information saved to the ibacm_addr.cfg
file.</p>

<p>NOTES The ib_acme utility performs two main functions.
With the -A and -O options, it automatically generates
address or options configuration files. The generated files
are text based and may be edited. These options are intended
to provide a simple way to configure address and option
information on all nodes on a cluster.</p>

<p>The other function of the ib_acme utility is to test the
ibacm service, including helping to verify that the service
is usable given the cur- rent cluster configuration. The
ib_acme utility can resolve IP addresses, network names, or
IB LIDs into a path record. It can then compare that path
record against one obtained by the SA. When used to test the
ibacm service, the ib_acme utility has the side effect of
loading the ibacm caches.</p>

<p>Multiple, numerical destinations can be specified by
adding brackets [] to the end of a base destination name or
address. Users may specify a list of numerical ranges inside
the brackets using the following exam- ple as a guide:
node[1-3,5,7-8]. This will result in testing node1, node2,
node3, node5, node7, and node8.</p>
