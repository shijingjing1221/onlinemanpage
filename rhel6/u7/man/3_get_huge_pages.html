<p>NAME get_huge_pages, free_huge_pages - Allocate and free
hugepages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;hugetlbfs.h&gt;</p>

<p>void *get_huge_pages(size_t len, ghp_t flags); void
free_huge_pages(void *ptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION get_huge_pages() allocates a memory region
len bytes in size backed by hugepages. Hugepages may be of
benefit to applications that use large amounts of address
space and suffer a performance hit due to TLB misses.
Wall-clock time or oprofile can be used to determine if
there is a performance benefit from using hugepages or
not.</p>

<p>The len parameter must be hugepage-aligned. In the
current implementa- tion, only the default hugepage size may
be allocated via this func- tion. Use gethugepagesize to
discover what the alignment should be.</p>

<p>The flags argument changes the behaviour of the
function. Flags may be ord together.</p>

<p>GHP_DEFAULT</p>

<p>Allocate a region of memory of the requested length
backed by hugepages of the default hugepage size. Return
NULL if suffi- cient pages are not available</p>

<p>free_huge_pages() frees a region of memory allocated by
get_huge_pages(). The behaviour of the function if another
pointer is used, valid or otherwise, is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, a pointer is returned to the
allocated memory. On error, NULL is returned. errno will be
set based on what the failure of mmap() was due to.</p>
