<p>ACCEPT(2) Linux Programmer s Manual ACCEPT(2)</p>

<p>NAME accept - accept a connection on a socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; /* See NOTES */
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t
*addrlen);</p>

<p>#define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int accept4(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t
*addrlen, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The accept() system call is used with
connection-based socket types (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET).
It extracts the first connection request on the queue of
pending connections for the listening socket, sockfd,
creates a new connected socket, and returns a new file
descrip- tor referring to that socket. The newly created
socket is not in the listening state. The original socket
sockfd is unaffected by this call.</p>

<p>The argument sockfd is a socket that has been created
with socket(2), bound to a local address with bind(2), and
is listening for connections after a listen(2).</p>

<p>The argument addr is a pointer to a sockaddr structure.
This structure is filled in with the address of the peer
socket, as known to the com- munications layer. The exact
format of the address returned addr is determined by the
socket s address family (see socket(2) and the respective
protocol man pages). When addr is NULL, nothing is filled
in; in this case, addrlen is not used, and should also be
NULL.</p>

<p>The addrlen argument is a value-result argument: the
caller must ini- tialize it to contain the size (in bytes)
of the structure pointed to by addr; on return it will
contain the actual size of the peer address.</p>

<p>The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided
is too small; in this case, addrlen will return a value
greater than was supplied to the call.</p>

<p>If no pending connections are present on the queue, and
the socket is not marked as non-blocking, accept() blocks
the caller until a connec- tion is present. If the socket is
marked non-blocking and no pending connections are present
on the queue, accept() fails with the error EAGAIN or
EWOULDBLOCK.</p>

<p>In order to be notified of incoming connections on a
socket, you can use select(2) or poll(2). A readable event
will be delivered when a new connection is attempted and you
may then call accept() to get a socket for that connection.
Alternatively, you can set the socket to deliver SIGIO when
activity occurs on a socket; see socket(7) for details.</p>

<p>For certain protocols which require an explicit
confirmation, such as DECNet, accept() can be thought of as
merely dequeuing the next connec- tion request and not
implying confirmation. Confirmation can be implied by a
normal read or write on the new file descriptor, and
rejection can be implied by closing the new socket.
Currently only DECNet has these semantics on Linux.</p>

<p>If flags is 0, then accept4() is the same as accept().
The following values can be bitwise ORed in flags to obtain
different behavior:</p>

<p>SOCK_NONBLOCK Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the
new open file description. Using this flag saves extra calls
to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>SOCK_CLOEXEC Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on
the new file descriptor. See the description of the
O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be
useful.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these system calls return a
non-negative integer that is a descriptor for the accepted
socket. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>Error Handling Linux accept() (and accept4()) passes
already-pending network errors on the new socket as an error
code from accept(). This behavior differs from other BSD
socket implementations. For reliable operation the
application should detect the network errors defined for the
protocol after accept() and treat them like EAGAIN by
retrying. In case of TCP/IP these are ENETDOWN, EPROTO,
ENOPROTOOPT, EHOSTDOWN, ENONET, EHOSTUNREACH, EOPNOTSUPP,
and ENETUNREACH.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK The socket is marked
non-blocking and no connections are present to be accepted.
POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this
case, and does not require these constants to have the same
value, so a portable application should check for both pos-
sibilities.</p>

<p>EBADF The descriptor is invalid.</p>

<p>ECONNABORTED A connection has been aborted.</p>

<p>EFAULT The addr argument is not in a writable part of
the user address space.</p>

<p>EINTR The system call was interrupted by a signal that
was caught before a valid connection arrived; see
signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL Socket is not listening for connections, or
addrlen is invalid (e.g., is negative).</p>

<p>EINVAL (accept4()) invalid value in flags.</p>

<p>EMFILE The per-process limit of open file descriptors
has been reached.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOBUFS, ENOMEM Not enough free memory. This often means
that the memory allo- cation is limited by the socket buffer
limits, not by the system memory.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The descriptor references a file, not a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The referenced socket is not of type
SOCK_STREAM.</p>

<p>EPROTO Protocol error.</p>

<p>In addition, Linux accept() may fail if:</p>

<p>EPERM Firewall rules forbid connection.</p>

<p>In addition, network errors for the new socket and as
defined for the protocol may be returned. Various Linux
kernels can return other errors such as ENOSR,
ESOCKTNOSUPPORT, EPROTONOSUPPORT, ETIMEDOUT. The value
ERESTARTSYS may be seen during a trace.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The accept4() system call is available starting
with Linux 2.6.28; sup- port in glibc is available starting
with version 2.10.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO accept(): POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, 4.4BSD,
(accept() first appeared in 4.2BSD).</p>

<p>accept4() is a non-standard Linux extension.</p>

<p>On Linux, the new socket returned by accept() does not
inherit file status flags such as O_NONBLOCK and O_ASYNC
from the listening socket. This behavior differs from the
canonical BSD sockets implementation. Portable programs
should not rely on inheritance or non-inheritance of file
status flags and always explicitly set all required flags on
the socket returned from accept().</p>

<p>NOTES POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;, and this header file is not required on
Linux. However, some historical (BSD) implementations
required this header file, and portable applications are
probably wise to include it.</p>

<p>There may not always be a connection waiting after a
SIGIO is delivered or select(2) or poll(2) return a
readability event because the connec- tion might have been
removed by an asynchronous network error or another thread
before accept() is called. If this happens then the call
will block waiting for the next connection to arrive. To
ensure that accept() never blocks, the passed socket sockfd
needs to have the O_NONBLOCK flag set (see socket(7)).</p>

<p>The socklen_t type The third argument of accept() was
originally declared as an int * (and is that under libc4 and
libc5 and on many other systems like 4.x BSD, SunOS 4, SGI);
a POSIX.1g draft standard wanted to change it into a size_t
*, and that is what it is for SunOS 5. Later POSIX drafts
have socklen_t *, and so do the Single Unix Specification
and glibc2. Quot- ing Linus Torvalds:</p>

<p>&quot;_Any_ sane library _must_ have
&quot;socklen_t&quot; be the same size as int. Anything else
breaks any BSD socket layer stuff. POSIX initially did make
it a size_t, and I (and hopefully others, but obviously not
too many) complained to them very loudly indeed. Making it a
size_t is completely broken, exactly because size_t very
seldom is the same size as &quot;int&quot; on 64-bit
architectures, for example. And it has to be the same size
as &quot;int&quot; because thats what the BSD socket
interface is. Anyway, the POSIX people eventually got a
clue, and created &quot;socklen_t&quot;. They shouldnt have
touched it in the first place, but once they did they felt
it had to have a named type for some unfath- omable reason
(probably somebody didnt like losing face over having done
the original stupid thing, so they silently just renamed
their blunder).&quot;</p>
