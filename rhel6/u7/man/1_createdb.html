<p>NAME createdb - create a new PostgreSQL database</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS createdb [ option... ] [ dbname ] [ description
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION createdb creates a new PostgreSQL
database.</p>

<p>Normally, the database user who executes this command
becomes the owner of the new database. However a different
owner can be specified via the -O option, if the executing
user has appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>createdb is a wrapper around the SQL command CREATE
DATABASE [cre- ate_database(7)]. There is no effective
difference between creating databases via this utility and
via other methods for accessing the server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS createdb accepts the following command-line
arguments:</p>

<p>dbname Specifies the name of the database to be created.
The name must be unique among all PostgreSQL databases in
this cluster. The default is to create a database with the
same name as the cur- rent system user.</p>

<p>description Specifies a comment to be associated with
the newly created database.</p>

<p>-D tablespace</p>

<p>--tablespace tablespace Specifies the default tablespace
for the database.</p>

<p>-e</p>

<p>--echo Echo the commands that createdb generates and
sends to the server.</p>

<p>-l locale</p>

<p>--locale locale Specifies the locale to be used in this
database. This is equiv- alent to specifying both
--lc-collate and --lc-ctype.</p>

<p>--lc-collate locale Specifies the LC_COLLATE setting to
be used in this database.</p>

<p>--lc-ctype locale Specifies the LC_CTYPE setting to be
used in this database.</p>

<p>-E encoding</p>

<p>--encoding encoding Specifies the character encoding
scheme to be used in this database. The character sets
supported by the PostgreSQL server are described in in the
documentation.</p>

<p>-O owner</p>

<p>--owner owner Specifies the database user who will own
the new database.</p>

<p>-T template</p>

<p>--template template Specifies the template database from
which to build this database.</p>

<p>The options -D, -E, -l, -O, and -T correspond to options
of the under- lying SQL command CREATE DATABASE
[create_database(7)]; see there for more information about
them.</p>

<p>createdb also accepts the following command-line
arguments for connec- tion parameters:</p>

<p>-h host</p>

<p>--host host Specifies the host name of the machine on
which the server is running. If the value begins with a
slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain
socket.</p>

<p>-p port</p>

<p>--port port Specifies the TCP port or the local Unix
domain socket file extension on which the server is
listening for connections.</p>

<p>-U username</p>

<p>--username username User name to connect as.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>--no-password Never issue a password prompt. If the
server requires password authentication and a password is
not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the
connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in
batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a
password.</p>

<p>-W</p>

<p>--password Force createdb to prompt for a password
before connecting to a database.</p>

<p>This option is never essential, since createdb will
automati- cally prompt for a password if the server demands
password authentication. However, createdb will waste a
connection attempt finding out that the server wants a
password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT PGDATABASE If set, the name of the database
to create, unless overridden on the command line.</p>

<p>PGHOST</p>

<p>PGPORT</p>

<p>PGUSER Default connection parameters. PGUSER also
determines the name of the database to create, if it is not
specified on the command line or by PGDATABASE.</p>

<p>This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also
uses the environment variables supported by libpq (see in
the documentation).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS In case of difficulty, see CREATE DATABASE
[create_database(7)] and psql(1) for discussions of
potential problems and error messages. The database server
must be running at the targeted host. Also, any default
connection settings and environment variables used by the
libpq front- end library will apply.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To create the database demo using the default
database server:</p>

<p>$ createdb demo</p>

<p>To create the database demo using the server on host
eden, port 5000, using the LATIN1 encoding scheme with a
look at the underlying command:</p>

<p>$ createdb -p 5000 -h eden -E LATIN1 -e demo CREATE
DATABASE demo ENCODING LATIN1;</p>
