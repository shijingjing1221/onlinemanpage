<p>sane-microtek(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-microtek(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-microtek - SANE backend for Microtek
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-microtek library implements a SANE
(Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
the &quot;second generation&quot; Microtek scan- ners. At
present, the following hardware is known to work with this
backend:</p>

<p>Microtek ScanMaker E2, E3, E6 Microtek ScanMaker II,
IIG, IIHR, IISP, III Microtek ScanMaker 35t, 35t+, 45t
Microtek ScanMaker 600GS, 600ZS (see bug notes) Agfa
StudioScan Agfa StudioScan II, StudioScan IIsi Agfa Arcus II
(but not the &quot;Arcus&quot;) Agfa DuoScan (preliminary)
Vobis &quot;Highscreen Realscan&quot; Microtek Color PageWiz
(preliminary)</p>

<p>Transparent Media Adapter Document AutoFeeder</p>

<p>The driver supports line art, halftone, 8bpp gray, and
24bpp color scans at normal and &quot;expanded&quot;
resolutions (i.e. 1200x1200 on an E6), fast scans for color
previews, and downloadable gamma tables.</p>

<p>The supported scanners are all SCSI scanners. However,
some parallel port models may work (under Linux), if they
use a parport-&gt;scsi chip, and if you can find a
scsi-&gt;parport driver. This is known to be the case for
the Color PageWiz.</p>

<p>The driver does not support the newest Microtek
scanners, such as the V330 and V660, which use a new and
very different SCSI-II command set. For those, try the
alternate microtek2 backend. Most non-SCSI scanners would
use the new command set. Most scanners newer than the
Scanmaker E6 would use the new command set.</p>

<p>If you own a Microtek scanner other than the ones listed
above, tell us what happens --- see the BUGS section at the
end of this document.</p>

<p>Although this manual page is generally updated with each
release, up- to-date information on new releases and
extraneous helpful hints are available from the backend
homepage: http://www.mir.com/mtek/</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is the UNIX path-name for the special
device that corre- sponds to the scanner. The special device
name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a
device. Under Linux, such a device name could be /dev/sga or
/dev/sge, for example.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the microtek.conf file is
a list of device names that correspond to Microtek scanners.
Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored. A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p>/dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/sge</p>

<p>The configuration file may also contain the special
tokens norealcal or noprecal. norealcal will disable the use
of magic, undocumented scan- ner calibration commands which
are known to work on the E6, but may not work with other
models. noprecal will disable logic which tries to avoid
scanner precalibration. This logic would only have been
acti- vated if the magic calibration code was turned
off.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/microtek.conf The backend
configuration file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-microtek.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-microtek.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK If the library was compiled with
debugging support enabled, this environment variable
controls the debug level for this backend. A value of 128
requests maximally copious debug output; smaller levels
reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>BUGS Known bugs/limitations are:</p>

<p>Brightness and contrast broken. The 600GS is grayscale
only, and will lock up if you select color. (Unfortunately,
the 600GS and 600ZS are indistinguish- able by
software.)</p>

<p>i.e. dont complain about these --- but if brightness
and/or contrast do work for you, please tell me.</p>

<p>If your scanner locks up, try setting the norealcal or
noprecal option in the configuration file (first one, then
both), and see if it helps. (If it does, report it.)</p>

<p>Send lengthy bug reports and new scanner information to
mtek-bugs@mir.com. All bug reports and new scanner inquiries
should include an error log file. You can generate copious
stderr output by setting the SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK environment
variable described above. For example:</p>

<p>setenv SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK 128</p>

frontends or SANE should go to

mailing list. Have a look at
