<p>EPOLL_CREATE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
EPOLL_CREATE(2)</p>

<p>NAME epoll_create, epoll_create1 - open an epoll file
descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;</p>

<p>int epoll_create(int size); int epoll_create1(int
flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION epoll_create() creates an epoll
&quot;instance&quot;, requesting the kernel to allocate an
event backing store dimensioned for size descriptors. The
size is not the maximum size of the backing store but just a
hint to the kernel about how to dimension internal
structures. (Nowadays, size is ignored; see NOTES
below.)</p>

<p>epoll_create() returns a file descriptor referring to
the new epoll instance. This file descriptor is used for all
the subsequent calls to the epoll interface. When no longer
required, the file descriptor returned by epoll_create()
should be closed by using close(2). When all file
descriptors referring to an epoll instance have been closed,
the kernel destroys the instance and releases the associated
resources for re-use.</p>

<p>If flags is 0, then, other than the fact that the
obsolete size argu- ment is dropped, epoll_create1() is the
same as epoll_create(). The following value can be included
in flags to obtain different behavior:</p>

<p>EPOLL_CLOEXEC Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on
the new file descrip- tor. See the description of the
O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be
useful.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, these system calls return a
non-negative file descriptor. On error, -1 is returned, and
errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL size is not positive.</p>

<p>EINVAL (epoll_create1()) Invalid value specified in
flags.</p>

<p>EMFILE The per-user limit on the number of epoll
instances imposed by /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances
was encountered. See epoll(7) for further details.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create the
kernel object.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO epoll_create() is Linux-specific, and was
introduced in kernel 2.5.44.</p>

<p>NOTES Since Linux 2.6.8, the size argument is unused.
(The kernel dynami- cally sizes the required data structures
without needing this initial hint.)</p>
