<p>NAME Parse::Yapp - Perl extension for generating and
using LALR parsers.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS yapp -m MyParser grammar_file.yp</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>use MyParser;</p>

<p>$parser=new MyParser(); $value=$parser-&gt;YYParse(yylex
=&gt; lexer_sub, yyerror =&gt; error_sub);</p>

<p>$nberr=$parser-&gt;YYNberr();</p>

<p>$parser-&gt;YYData-&gt;{DATA}= [ &rsquo;Anything&rsquo;,
&rsquo;You Want&rsquo; ];</p>

<p>$data=$parser-&gt;YYData-&gt;{DATA}[0];</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Parse::Yapp (Yet Another Perl Parser
compiler) is a collection of modules that let you generate
and use yacc like thread safe (reentrant) parsers with perl
object oriented interface.</p>

<p>The script yapp is a front-end to the Parse::Yapp module
and let you easily create a Perl OO parser from an input
grammar file.</p>

<p>The Grammar file &quot;Comments&quot; Through all your
files, comments are either Perl style, introduced by # up to
the end of line, or C style, enclosed between /* and */.</p>

<p>&quot;Tokens and string literals&quot; Through all the
grammar files, two kind of symbols may appear: Non- terminal
symbols, called also left-hand-side symbols, which are the
names of your rules, and Terminal symbols, called also
Tokens.</p>

<p>Tokens are the symbols your lexer function will feed
your parser with (see below). They are of two flavours:
symbolic tokens and string literals.</p>

<p>Non-terminals and symbolic tokens share the same
identifier syntax:</p>

<p>[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*</p>

<p>String literals are enclosed in single quotes and can
contain almost anything. They will be output to your parser
file double- quoted, making any special character as such.
&quot;, $ and @ will be automatically quoted with , making
their writing more natural. On the other hand, if you need a
single quote inside your literal, just quote it with .</p>

<p>You cannot have a literal error_in your grammar as it
would confuse the driver with the error token. Use a
symbolic token instead. In case you inadvertently use it,
this will produce a warning telling you you should have
written it error and will treat it as if it were the error
token, which is certainly NOT what you meant.</p>

<p>&quot;Grammar file syntax&quot; It is very close to yacc
syntax (in fact, Parse::Yapp should compile a clean yacc
grammar without any modification, whereas the opposite is
not true).</p>

<p>This file is divided in three sections, separated by
&quot;%%&quot;:</p>

<p>header section %% rules section %% footer section</p>

<p>The Header Section section may optionally contain: * One
or more code blocks enclosed inside &quot;%{&quot; and
&quot;%}&quot; just like in yacc. They may contain any valid
Perl code and will be copied verbatim at the very beginning
of the parser module. They are not as useful as they are in
yacc, but you can use them, for example, for global variable
declarations, though you will notice later that such global
variables can be avoided to make a reentrant parser
module.</p>

<p>* Precedence declarations, introduced by %left, %right
and %nonassoc specifying associativity, followed by the list
of tokens or litterals having the same precedence and
associativity. The precedence beeing the latter declared
will be having the highest level. (see the yacc or bison
manuals for a full explanation of how they work, as they are
implemented exactly the same way in Parse::Yapp)</p>

<p>* %start followed by a rule s left hand side, declaring
this rule to be the starting rule of your grammar. The
default, when %start is not used, is the first rule in your
grammar section.</p>

<p>* %token followed by a list of symbols, forcing them to
be recognized as tokens, generating a syntax error if used
in the left hand side of a rule declaration. Note that in
Parse::Yapp, you dont need to declare tokens as in yacc: any
symbol not appearing as a left hand side of a rule is
considered to be a token. Other yacc declarations or
constructs such as %type and %union are parsed but (almost)
ignored.</p>

<p>* %expect followed by a number, suppress warnings about
number of Shift/Reduce conflicts when both numbers match, a
la bison.</p>

<p>The Rule Section contains your grammar rules: A rule is
made of a left-hand-side symbol, followed by a
&rsquo;:&rsquo; and one or more right-hand-sides separated
by &rsquo;|&rsquo; and terminated by a &rsquo;;&rsquo;:</p>

<p>exp: exp &rsquo;+&rsquo; exp | exp &rsquo;-&rsquo; exp
;</p>

<p>A right hand side may be empty:</p>

<p>input: #empty | input line ;</p>

<p>(if you have more than one empty rhs, Parse::Yapp will
issue a warning, as this is usually a mistake, and you will
certainly have a reduce/reduce conflict)</p>

<p>A rhs may be followed by an optional %prec directive,
followed by a token, giving the rule an explicit precedence
(see yacc manuals for its precise meaning) and optionnal
semantic action code block (see below).</p>

<p>exp: &rsquo;-&rsquo; exp %prec NEG { -$_[1] } | exp
&rsquo;+&rsquo; exp { $_[1] + $_[3] } | NUM ;</p>

<p>Note that in Parse::Yapp, a lhs cannot appear more than
once as a rule name (This differs from yacc).</p>

<p>&quot;The footer section&quot; may contain any valid
Perl code and will be appended at the very end of your
parser module. Here you can write your lexer, error report
subs and anything relevant to you parser.</p>

<p>&quot;Semantic actions&quot; Semantic actions are run
every time a reduction occurs in the parsing flow and they
must return a semantic value.</p>

<p>They are (usually, but see below &quot;In rule
actions&quot;) written at the very end of the rhs, enclosed
with &quot;{ }&quot;, and are copied verbatim to your parser
file, inside of the rules table.</p>

<p>Be aware that matching braces in Perl is much more
difficult than in C: inside strings they dont need to match.
While in C it is very easy to detect the beginning of a
string construct, or a single character, it is much more
difficult in Perl, as there are so many ways of writing such
literals. So there is no check for that today. If you need a
brace in a double-quoted string, just quote it (&quot;&quot;
or &quot;&quot;). For single-quoted strings, you will need
to make a comment matching it in th right order. Sorry for
the inconvenience.</p>

<p>{ &quot;{ My string block }&quot;. &quot; My other
string block &quot;. qq/ My unmatched brace /. # Force the
match: { q/ for my closing brace } / q/ My opening brace { /
# must be closed: } }</p>

<p>All of these constructs should work.</p>

<p>In Parse::Yapp, semantic actions are called like normal
Perl sub calls, with their arguments passed in @_, and their
semantic value are their return values.</p>

<p>$_[1] to $_[n] are the parameters just as $1 to $n in
yacc, while $_[0] is the parser object itself.</p>

<p>Having $_[0] beeing the parser object itself allows you
to call parser methods. Thats how the yacc macros are
implemented:</p>

<p>yyerrok is done by calling $_[0]-&gt;YYErrok YYERROR is
done by calling $_[0]-&gt;YYError YYACCEPT is done by
calling $_[0]-&gt;YYAccept YYABORT is done by calling
$_[0]-&gt;YYAbort</p>

<p>All those methods explicitly return undef, for
convenience.</p>

<p>YYRECOVERING is done by calling
$_[0]-&gt;YYRecovering</p>

<p>Four useful methods in error recovery sub</p>

<p>$_[0]-&gt;YYCurtok $_[0]-&gt;YYCurval $_[0]-&gt;YYExpect
$_[0]-&gt;YYLexer</p>

<p>return respectivly the current input token that made the
parse fail, its semantic value (both can be used to modify
their values too, but know what you are doing ! See Error
reporting routine section for an example), a list which
contains the tokens the parser expected when the failure
occured and a reference to the lexer routine.</p>

<p>Note that if &quot;$_[0]-&gt;YYCurtok&quot; is declared
as a %nonassoc token, it can be included in
&quot;$_[0]-&gt;YYExpect&quot; list whenever the input try
to use it in an associative way. This is not a bug: the
token IS expected to report an error if encountered.</p>

<p>To detect such a thing in your error reporting sub, the
following example should do the trick:</p>

<p>grep { $_[0]-&gt;YYCurtok eq $_ } $_[0]-&gt;YYExpect and
do { #Non-associative token used in an associative
expression };</p>

<p>Accessing semantics values on the left of your reducing
rule is done through the method</p>

<p>$_[0]-&gt;YYSemval( index )</p>

<p>where index is an integer. Its value being 1 .. n
returns the same values than $_[1] .. $_[n], but -n .. 0
returns values on the left of the rule beeing reduced (It is
related to $-n .. $0 .. $n in yacc, but you cannot use $_[0]
or $_[-n] constructs in Parse::Yapp for obvious reasons)</p>

<p>There is also a provision for a user data area in the
parser object, accessed by the method:</p>

<p>$_[0]-&gt;YYData</p>

<p>which returns a reference to an anonymous hash, which
let you have all of your parsing data held inside the object
(see the Calc.yp or ParseYapp.yp files in the distribution
for some examples). Thats how you can make you parser module
reentrant: all of your module states and variables are held
inside the parser object.</p>

<p>Note: unfortunatly, method calls in Perl have a lot of
overhead, and when YYData is used, it may be called a huge
number of times. If your are not a *real* purist and
efficiency is your concern, you may access directly the
user-space in the object: $parser-&gt;{USER} wich is a
reference to an anonymous hash array, and then
benchmark.</p>

<p>If no action is specified for a rule, the equivalant of
a default action is run, which returns the first
parameter:</p>

<p>{ $_[1] }</p>

<p>&quot;In rule actions&quot; It is also possible to embed
semantic actions inside of a rule:</p>

<p>typedef: TYPE { $type = $_[1] } identlist { ... } ;</p>

<p>When the Parse::Yapp s parser encounter such an embedded
action, it modifies the grammar as if you wrote (although
@x-1 is not a legal lhs value):</p>

<p>@x-1: /* empty */ { $type = $_[1] }; typedef: TYPE @x-1
identlist { ... } ;</p>

<p>where x is a sequential number incremented for each
&quot;in rule&quot; action, and -1 represents the &quot;dot
position&quot; in the rule where the action arises.</p>

<p>In such actions, you can use $_[1]..$_[n] variables,
which are the semantic values on the left of your
action.</p>

<p>Be aware that the way Parse::Yapp modifies your grammar
because of in rule actions can produce, in some cases,
spurious conflicts that wouldnt happen otherwise.</p>

<p>&quot;Generating the Parser Module&quot; Now that you
grammar file is written, you can use yapp on it to generate
your parser module:</p>

<p>yapp -v Calc.yp</p>

<p>will create two files Calc.pm, your parser module, and
Calc.output a verbose output of your parser rules,
conflicts, warnings, states and summary.</p>

<p>What your are missing now is a lexer routine.</p>

<p>&quot;The Lexer sub&quot; is called each time the parser
need to read the next token.</p>

<p>It is called with only one argument that is the parser
object itself, so you can access its methods, specially
the</p>

<p>$_[0]-&gt;YYData</p>

<p>data area.</p>

<p>It is its duty to return the next token and value to the
parser. They &quot;must&quot; be returned as a list of two
variables, the first one is the token known by the parser
(symbolic or literal), the second one beeing anything you
want (usualy the content of the token, or the literal value)
from a simple scalar value to any complex reference, as the
parsing driver never use it but to call semantic
actions:</p>

<p>( &rsquo;NUMBER&rsquo;, $num ) or ( &rsquo;&gt;=&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&gt;=&rsquo; ) or ( &rsquo;ARRAY&rsquo;, [ @values ]
)</p>

<p>When the lexer reach the end of input, it must return
the &rsquo;&rsquo; empty token with an undef value:</p>

<p>( &rsquo;&rsquo;, undef )</p>

<p>Note that your lexer should never return
&rsquo;error&rsquo; as token value: for the driver, this is
the error token used for error recovery and would lead to
odd reactions.</p>

<p>Now that you have your lexer written, maybe you will
need to output meaningful error messages, instead of the
default which is to print Parse error. on STDERR.</p>

<p>So you will need an Error reporting sub.</p>

<p>item &quot;Error reporting routine&quot;</p>

<p>If you want one, write it knowing that it is passed as
parameter the parser object. So you can share information
whith the lexer routine quite easily.</p>

<p>You can also use the &quot;$_[0]-&gt;YYErrok&quot;
method in it, which will resume parsing as if no error
occured. Of course, since the invalid token is still
invalid, youre supposed to fix the problem by yourself.</p>

<p>The method &quot;$_[0]-&gt;YYLexer&quot; may help you,
as it returns a reference to the lexer routine, and can be
called as</p>

<p>($tok,$val)=&amp;{$_[0]-&gt;Lexer}</p>

<p>to get the next token and semantic value from the input
stream. To make them current for the parser, use:</p>

<p>($_[0]-&gt;YYCurtok, $_[0]-&gt;YYCurval) = ($tok,
$val)</p>

<p>and know what youre doing...</p>

<p>&quot;Parsing&quot; Now youve got everything to do the
parsing.</p>

<p>First, use the parser module:</p>

<p>use Calc;</p>

<p>Then create the parser object:</p>

<p>$parser=new Calc;</p>

<p>Now, call the YYParse method, telling it where to find
the lexer and error report subs:</p>

<p>$result=$parser-&gt;YYParse(yylex =&gt; Lexer, yyerror
=&gt; ErrorReport);</p>

<p>(assuming Lexer and ErrorReport subs have been written
in your current package)</p>

<p>The order in which parameters appear is unimportant.</p>

<p>Et voila.</p>

<p>The YYParse method will do the parse, then return the
last semantic value returned, or undef if error recovery
cannot recover.</p>

<p>If you need to be sure the parse has been successful (in
case your last returned semantic value is undef) make a call
to:</p>

<p>$parser-&gt;YYNberr()</p>

<p>which returns the total number of time the error
reporting sub has been called.</p>

<p>&quot;Error Recovery&quot; in Parse::Yapp is implemented
the same way it is in yacc.</p>

<p>&quot;Debugging Parser&quot; To debug your parser, you
can call the YYParse method with a debug parameter:</p>

<p>$parser-&gt;YYParse( ... , yydebug =&gt; value, ...
)</p>

<p>where value is a bitfield, each bit representing a
specific debug output:</p>

<p>Bit Value Outputs 0x01 Token reading (useful for Lexer
debugging) 0x02 States information 0x04 Driver actions
(shifts, reduces, accept...) 0x08 Parse Stack dump 0x10
Error Recovery tracing</p>

<p>To have a full debugging ouput, use</p>

<p>debug =&gt; 0x1F</p>

<p>Debugging output is sent to STDERR, and be aware that it
can produce &quot;huge&quot; outputs.</p>

<p>&quot;Standalone Parsers&quot; By default, the parser
modules generated will need the Parse::Yapp module installed
on the system to run. They use the Parse::Yapp::Driver which
can be safely shared between parsers in the same script.</p>

<p>In the case you d prefer to have a standalone module
generated, use the &quot;-s&quot; switch with yapp: this
will automagically copy the driver code into your module so
you can use/distribute it without the need of the
Parse::Yapp module, making it really a &quot;Standalone
Parser&quot;.</p>

<p>If you do so, please remember to include Parse::Yapps
copyright notice in your main module copyright, so others
can know about Parse::Yapp module.</p>

<p>&quot;Source file line numbers&quot; by default will be
included in the generated parser module, which will help to
find the guilty line in your source file in case of a syntax
error. You can disable this feature by compiling your
grammar with yapp using the &quot;-n&quot; switch.</p>

<p>BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS If you find bugs, think of anything
that could improve Parse::Yapp or have any questions related
to it, feel free to contact the author.</p>
