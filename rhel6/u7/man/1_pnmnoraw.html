<p>NAME pnmnoraw - replaced by pnmtoplainpnm</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmnoraw was replaced in Netpbm 8.2 (March 2000) by
pnmto- plainpnm(1),whichwasobsoletedby pnmtopnm in Netpbm
10.23 (July 2004).</p>

<p>pnmtoplainpnm was actually the same program; it was just
renamed to make it clear that is just a format
converter.</p>

<p>pnmtopnm is more general, in that it can go both
directions. pnmtopnm -plain is the same as pnmnoraw.</p>
