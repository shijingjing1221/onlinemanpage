<p>NAME pgmramp - generate a grayscale ramp</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmramp -lr|-tb|-rectangle|-ellipse
-maxval=maxval width height</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or an equals sign
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>Generates a graymap of the specified size containing a
black-to-white ramp. These ramps are useful for multiplying
with other images, using pamarith.</p>

<p>The ramp is linear in brightness, not intensity. I.e.
the gamma-cor- rected sample values in the PGM rise linearly
with distance from the corner of the image. If you want a
ramp that is linear in light inten- sity, use pnmgamma with
pgmramp.</p>

<p>To generate a simple ramp of all the values from 0 to
maxval, and not necessarily a graphic image, use
pamseq(1).</p>

<p>ppmrainbow does something similar to what pgmramp does,
but for color. The image fades between two colors of your
choice.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You must specify exactly one of the ramp type
options.</p>

<p>-lr A left to right ramp.</p>

<p>-tb A top to bottom ramp.</p>

<p>-rectangle An outside-in rectangular ramp. It is black
around the edges and white in the center.</p>

<p>-ellipse An outside-in elliptical ramp. It is black
around the edge and white in the center.</p>

<p>-maxval=maxval The maxval for the generated image.
Default is 255.</p>

<p>This option did not exist before June 2002. Before, the
maxval was always 255.</p>
