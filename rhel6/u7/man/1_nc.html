<p>NAME nc - arbitrary TCP and UDP connections and
listens</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nc [-46DdhklnrStUuvzC] [-i interval] [-p
source_port] [-s source_ip_address] [-T ToS] [-w timeout]
[-X proxy_protocol] [-x proxy_address[:port]] [hostname]
[port[s]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just
about anything under the sun involving TCP or UDP. It can
open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary
TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4
and IPv6. Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts nicely, and separates
error messages onto standard error instead of sending them
to standard output, as telnet(1) does with some.</p>

<p>Common uses include:</p>

<p>&middot; simple TCP proxies &middot; shell-script based
HTTP clients and servers &middot; network daemon testing
&middot; a SOCKS or HTTP ProxyCommand for ssh(1) &middot;
and much, much more</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-4 Forces nc to use IPv4 addresses only.</p>

<p>-6 Forces nc to use IPv6 addresses only.</p>

<p>-D Enable debugging on the socket.</p>

<p>-d Do not attempt to read from stdin.</p>

<p>-h Prints out nc help.</p>

<p>-i interval Specifies a delay time interval between
lines of text sent and received. Also causes a delay time
between connections to multi- ple ports.</p>

<p>-k Forces nc to stay listening for another connection
after its cur- rent connection is completed. It is an error
to use this option without the -l option.</p>

<p>-l Used to specify that nc should listen for an incoming
connection rather than initiate a connection to a remote
host. It is an error to use this option in conjunction with
the -p, -s, or -z options. Additionally, any timeouts
specified with the -w option are ignored.</p>

<p>-n Do not do any DNS or service lookups on any specified
addresses, hostnames or ports.</p>

<p>-p source_port Specifies the source port nc should use,
subject to privilege restrictions and availability. It is an
error to use this option in conjunction with the -l
option.</p>

<p>-r Specifies that source and/or destination ports should
be chosen randomly instead of sequentially within a range or
in the order that the system assigns them.</p>

<p>-S Enables the RFC 2385 TCP MD5 signature option.</p>

<p>-s source_ip_address Specifies the IP of the interface
which is used to send the pack- ets. It is an error to use
this option in conjunction with the -l option.</p>

<p>-T ToS Specifies IP Type of Service (ToS) for the
connection. Valid values are the tokens lowdelay ,
throughput , reliability, or an 8-bit hexadecimal value
preceded by 0x.</p>

<p>-C Send CRLF as line-ending</p>

<p>-t Causes nc to send RFC 854 DONT and WONT responses to
RFC 854 DO and WILL requests. This makes it possible to use
nc to script telnet sessions.</p>

<p>-U Specifies to use Unix Domain Sockets.</p>

<p>-u Use UDP instead of the default option of TCP.</p>

<p>-v Have nc give more verbose output.</p>

<p>-w timeout If a connection and stdin are idle for more
than timeout seconds, then the connection is silently
closed. The -w flag has no effect on the -l option, i.e. nc
will listen forever for a con- nection, with or without the
-w flag. The default is no timeout.</p>

<p>-X proxy_version Requests that nc should use the
specified protocol when talking to the proxy server.
Supported protocols are 4 (SOCKS v.4), 5 (SOCKS v.5) and
connect (HTTPS proxy). If the protocol is not specified,
SOCKS version 5 is used.</p>

<p>-x proxy_address[:port] Requests that nc should connect
to hostname using a proxy at proxy_address and port. If port
is not specified, the well-known port for the proxy protocol
is used (1080 for SOCKS, 3128 for HTTPS).</p>

<p>-z Specifies that nc should just scan for listening
daemons, without sending any data to them. It is an error to
use this option in conjunction with the -l option.</p>

<p>hostname can be a numerical IP address or a symbolic
hostname (unless the -n option is given). In general, a
hostname must be specified, unless the -l option is given
(in which case the local host is used).</p>

<p>port[s] can be single integers or ranges. Ranges are in
the form nn-mm. In general, a destination port must be
specified, unless the -U option is given (in which case a
socket must be specified).</p>

<p>CLIENT/SERVER MODEL It is quite simple to build a very
basic client/server model using nc. On one console, start nc
listening on a specific port for a connection. For
example:</p>

<p>$ nc -l 1234</p>

<p>nc is now listening on port 1234 for a connection. On a
second console (or a second machine), connect to the machine
and port being listened on:</p>

<p>$ nc 127.0.0.1 1234</p>

<p>There should now be a connection between the ports.
Anything typed at the second console will be concatenated to
the first, and vice-versa. After the connection has been set
up, nc does not really care which side is being used as a
server and which side is being used as a client. The
connection may be terminated using an EOF (^D).</p>

<p>DATA TRANSFER The example in the previous section can be
expanded to build a basic data transfer model. Any
information input into one end of the connection will be
output to the other end, and input and output can be easily
cap- tured in order to emulate file transfer.</p>

<p>Start by using nc to listen on a specific port, with
output captured into a file:</p>

<p>$ nc -l 1234 &gt; filename.out</p>

<p>Using a second machine, connect to the listening nc
process, feeding it the file which is to be transferred:</p>

<p>$ nc host.example.com 1234 &lt; filename.in</p>

<p>After the file has been transferred, the connection will
close automati- cally.</p>

<p>TALKING TO SERVERS It is sometimes useful to talk to
servers by hand rather than through a user interface. It can
aid in troubleshooting, when it might be neces- sary to
verify what data a server is sending in response to commands
issued by the client. For example, to retrieve the home page
of a web site:</p>

<p>0r0 | nc host.example.com 80 $ echo -n &quot;GET /
HTTP/1.0</p>

<p>Note that this also displays the headers sent by the web
server. They can be filtered, using a tool such as sed(1),
if necessary.</p>

<p>More complicated examples can be built up when the user
knows the format of requests required by the server. As
another example, an email may be submitted to an SMTP server
using:</p>

<p>$ nc [-C] localhost 25 &lt;&lt; EOF HELO
host.example.com MAIL FROM: &lt;user@host.example.com&gt;
RCPT TO: &lt;user2@host.example.com&gt; DATA Body of email.
. QUIT EOF</p>

<p>PORT SCANNING It may be useful to know which ports are
open and running services on a target machine. The -z flag
can be used to tell nc to report open ports, rather than
initiate a connection. For example:</p>

<p>$ nc -z host.example.com 20-30 Connection to
host.example.com 22 port [tcp/ssh] succeeded! Connection to
host.example.com 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!</p>

<p>The port range was specified to limit the search to
ports 20 - 30.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it might be useful to know which server
software is run- ning, and which versions. This information
is often contained within the greeting banners. In order to
retrieve these, it is necessary to first make a connection,
and then break the connection when the banner has been
retrieved. This can be accomplished by specifying a small
timeout with the -w flag, or perhaps by issuing a
&quot;QUIT&quot; command to the server:</p>

<p>$ echo &quot;QUIT&quot; | nc host.example.com 20-30
SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.6.1p2 Protocol mismatch. 220
host.example.com IMS SMTP Receiver Version 0.84 Ready</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Open a TCP connection to port 42 of
host.example.com, using port 31337 as the source port, with
a timeout of 5 seconds:</p>

<p>$ nc -p 31337 -w 5 host.example.com 42</p>

<p>Open a UDP connection to port 53 of
host.example.com:</p>

<p>$ nc -u host.example.com 53</p>

<p>Open a TCP connection to port 42 of host.example.com
using 10.1.2.3 as the IP for the local end of the
connection:</p>

<p>$ nc -s 10.1.2.3 host.example.com 42</p>

<p>Create and listen on a Unix Domain Socket:</p>

<p>$ nc -lU /var/tmp/dsocket</p>

<p>Connect to port 42 of host.example.com via an HTTP proxy
at 10.2.3.4, port 8080. This example could also be used by
ssh(1); see the ProxyCommand directive in ssh_config(5) for
more information.</p>

<p>$ nc -x10.2.3.4:8080 -Xconnect host.example.com 42</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cat(1), ssh(1)</p>

<p>AUTHORS Original implementation by *Hobbit*
hobbit@avian.org. Rewritten with IPv6 support by Eric
Jackson ericj@monkey.org .</p>

<p>CAVEATS UDP port scans will always succeed (i.e. report
the port as open), ren- dering the -uz combination of flags
relatively useless.</p>
