<p>NAME setfiles - set file SELinux security contexts.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setfiles</p>

<p>[-dnpqvW] [-o filename] [-r alt_root_path ] spec_file
pathname...</p>

<p>-c policyfile spec_file</p>

<p>-s [-dnpqvW] [-o filename ] spec_file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the setfiles
program.</p>

<p>This program is primarily used to initialize the
security context database (extended attributes) on one or
more filesystems. This pro- gram is initially run as part of
the SE Linux installation process.</p>

<p>It can also be run at any time to correct errors, to add
support for new policy, or with the -n option it can just
check whether the file contexts are all as you expect.</p>

<p>If a file object does not have a context, setfiles will
write the default context to the file objects extended
attributes. If a file object has a context, setfiles will
only modify the type portion of the security context. The -F
option will force a replacement of the entire context.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c check the validity of the contexts against
the specified binary policy.</p>

<p>-d show what specification matched each file.</p>

<p>-l log changes in file labels to syslog.</p>

<p>-n dont change any file labels.</p>

<p>-p show progress by printing * every 1000 files.</p>

<p>-q suppress non-error output.</p>

<p>-r rootpath use an alternate root path</p>

<p>-e directory directory to exclude (repeat option for
more than one direc- tory.)</p>

<p>-F Force reset of context to match file_context for
customizable files, and the default file context, changing
the user, role, range portion as well as the type.</p>

<p>-o filename save list of files with incorrect context in
filename.</p>

<p>-s take a list of files from standard input instead of
using a pathname on the command line.</p>

<p>-v show changes in file labels.</p>

<p>-W display warnings about entries that had no matching
files.</p>

<p>-0 Input items are terminated by a null character
instead of by whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are
not special (every character is taken literally). Disables
the end of file string, which is treated like any other
argument. Useful when input items might contain white space,
quote marks, or back- slashes.The GNU find -print0 option
produces input suitable for this mode.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS spec_file The specification file which
contains lines of the following form regexp [ -type ] (
context | &lt;&lt;none&gt;&gt; ) The regular expression is
anchored at both ends. The optional type field specifies the
file type as shown in the mode field by the ls(1) program,
e.g. -- to match only regular files or -d to match only
direc- tories. The context can be an ordinary security
context or the string &lt;&lt;none&gt;&gt; to specify that
the file is not to have its context changed. The last
matching specification is used. If there are multiple hard
links to a file that match different specifications and
those specifi- cations indicate different security contexts,
then a warning is dis- played but the file is still labeled
based on the last matching speci- fication other than
&lt;&lt;none&gt;&gt;.</p>

<p>pathname... The pathname for the root directory of each
file system to be relabeled. Not used if the -s option is
used.</p>
