<p>DMA_POOL_CREATE(9) Memory Management in Linux
DMA_POOL_CREATE(9)</p>

<p>NAME dma_pool_create - Creates a pool of consistent
memory blocks, for dma.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct dma_pool * dma_pool_create(const char *
name, struct device * dev, size_t size, size_t align, size_t
boundary);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS name name of pool, for diagnostics</p>

<p>dev device that will be doing the DMA</p>

<p>size size of the blocks in this pool.</p>

<p>align alignment requirement for blocks; must be a power
of two</p>

<p>boundary returned blocks won&acute;t cross this power of
two boundary</p>

<p>CONTEXT !in_interrupt</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Returns a dma allocation pool with the
requested characteristics, or null if one can&acute;t be
created. Given one of these pools, dma_pool_alloc may be
used to allocate memory. Such memory will all have
consistent DMA mappings, accessible by the device and its
driver without using cache flushing primitives. The actual
size of blocks allocated may be larger than requested
because of alignment.</p>

<p>If boundary is nonzero, objects returned from
dma_pool_alloc won&acute;t cross that size boundary. This is
useful for devices which have addressing restrictions on
individual DMA transfers, such as not crossing boundaries of
4KBytes.</p>
