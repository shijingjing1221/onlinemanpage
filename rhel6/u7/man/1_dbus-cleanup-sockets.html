<p>NAME dbus-cleanup-sockets - clean up leftover sockets in
a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dbus-cleanup-sockets [DIRECTORY]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The dbus-cleanup-sockets command cleans up
unused D-Bus connection sockets. See
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more infor-
mation about the big picture.</p>

<p>If given no arguments, dbus-cleanup-sockets cleans up
sockets in the standard default socket directory for the
per-user-login-session mes- sage bus; this is usually /tmp.
Optionally, you can pass a different directory on the
command line.</p>

<p>On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because
D-Bus defaults to using &quot;abstract sockets&quot; that
exist only in memory and dont have a corresponding file in
/tmp.</p>

<p>On most other flavors of UNIX, it s possible for the
socket files to leak when programs using D-Bus exit
abnormally or without closing their D-Bus connections. Thus,
it might be interesting to run dbus-cleanup- sockets in a
cron job to mop up any leaked sockets. Or you can just
ignore the leaked sockets, they aren t really hurting
anything, other than cluttering the output of &quot;ls
/tmp&quot;</p>

<p>AUTHOR dbus-cleanup-sockets was adapted by Havoc
Pennington from linc-cleanup- sockets written by Michael
Meeks.</p>

<p>BUGS Please send bug reports to the D-Bus mailing list
or bug tracker, see
