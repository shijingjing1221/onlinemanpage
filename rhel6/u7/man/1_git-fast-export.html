<p>GIT-FAST-EXPORT(1) Git Manual GIT-FAST-EXPORT(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-fast-export - Git data exporter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git fast-export [options] | git fast-import</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program dumps the given revisions in a
form suitable to be piped into git fast-import.</p>

<p>You can use it as a human-readable bundle replacement
(see git- bundle(1)), or as a kind of an interactive git
filter-branch.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --progress=&lt;n&gt; Insert progress statements
every &lt;n&gt; objects, to be shown by git fast-import
during import.</p>

<p>--signed-tags=(verbatim|warn|strip|abort) Specify how to
handle signed tags. Since any transformation after the
export can change the tag names (which can also happen when
excluding revisions) the signatures will not match.</p>

<p>When asking to abort (which is the default), this
program will die when encountering a signed tag. With strip,
the tags will be made unsigned, with verbatim, they will be
silently exported and with warn, they will be exported, but
you will see a warning.</p>

<p>--tag-of-filtered-object=(abort|drop|rewrite) Specify
how to handle tags whose tagged object is filtered out.
Since revisions and files to export can be limited by path,
tagged objects may be filtered completely.</p>

<p>When asking to abort (which is the default), this
program will die when encountering such a tag. With drop it
will omit such tags from the output. With rewrite, if the
tagged object is a commit, it will rewrite the tag to tag an
ancestor commit (via parent rewriting; see
git-rev-list(1))</p>

<p>-M, -C Perform move and/or copy detection, as described
in the git-diff(1) manual page, and use it to generate
rename and copy commands in the output dump.</p>

<p>Note that earlier versions of this command did not
complain and produced incorrect results if you gave these
options.</p>

<p>--export-marks=&lt;file&gt; Dumps the internal marks
table to &lt;file&gt; when complete. Marks are written one
per line as :markid SHA-1. Only marks for revisions are
dumped; marks for blobs are ignored. Backends can use this
file to validate imports after they have been completed, or
to save the marks table across incremental runs. As
&lt;file&gt; is only opened and truncated at completion, the
same path can also be safely given to --import-marks.</p>

<p>--import-marks=&lt;file&gt; Before processing any input,
load the marks specified in &lt;file&gt;. The input file
must exist, must be readable, and must use the same format
as produced by --export-marks.</p>

<p>Any commits that have already been marked will not be
exported again. If the backend uses a similar --import-marks
file, this allows for incremental bidirectional exporting of
the repository by keeping the marks the same across
runs.</p>

<p>--fake-missing-tagger Some old repositories have tags
without a tagger. The fast-import protocol was pretty strict
about that, and did not allow that. So fake a tagger to be
able to fast-import the output.</p>

<p>--no-data Skip output of blob objects and instead refer
to blobs via their original SHA-1 hash. This is useful when
rewriting the directory structure or history of a repository
without touching the contents of individual files. Note that
the resulting stream can only be used by a repository which
already contains the necessary objects.</p>

<p>[git-rev-list-args...] A list of arguments, acceptable
to git rev-parse and git rev-list, that specifies the
specific objects and references to export. For example,
master 10..master causes the current master reference to be
exported along with all objects added since its 10th
ancestor commit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES $ git fast-export --all | (cd /empty/repository
&amp;&amp; git fast-import)</p>

<p>This will export the whole repository and import it into
the existing empty repository. Except for reencoding commits
that are not in UTF-8, it would be a one-to-one mirror.</p>

<p>$ git fast-export master~5..master | sed
&quot;s|refs/heads/master|refs/heads/other|&quot; | git
fast-import</p>

<p>This makes a new branch called other from
master~5..master (i.e. if master has linear history, it will
take the last 5 commits).</p>

<p>Note that this assumes that none of the blobs and commit
messages referenced by that revision range contains the
string refs/heads/master.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Since git fast-import cannot tag trees, you
will not be able to export the linux-2.6.git repository
completely, as it contains a tag referencing a tree instead
of a commit.</p>
