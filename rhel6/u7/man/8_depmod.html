<p>NAME depmod - program to generate modules.dep and map
files.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS depmod [ -b basedir ] [ -e ] [ -F System.map ]
[ -n ] [ -v ] [ version ] [ -A ]</p>

<p>depmod [ -e ] [ -FSystem.map ] [ -n ] [ -v ] [ version ]
[ file- name... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Linux kernel modules can provide services
(called &quot;symbols&quot;) for other modules to use (using
EXPORT_SYMBOL in the code). If a second module uses this
symbol, that second module clearly depends on the first mod-
ule. These dependencies can get quite complex.</p>

<p>depmod creates a list of module dependencies by reading
each module under /lib/modules/version and determining what
symbols it exports and what symbols it needs. By default,
this list is written to modules.dep in the same directory.
If filenames are given on the command line, only those
modules are examined (which is rarely useful unless all
modules are listed).</p>

<p>If a version is provided, then that kernel version s
module directory is used rather than the current kernel
version (as returned by uname -r).</p>

<p>depmod will also generate various map files in this
directory for use by the hotplug infrastructure.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a --all Probe all modules. This option is
enabled by default if no file names are given in the
command-line.</p>

<p>-A --quick This option scans to see if any modules are
newer than the mod- ules.dep file before any work is done:
if not, it silently exits rather than regenerating the
files.</p>

<p>-b basedir --basedir basedir If your modules are not
currently in the (normal) directory /lib/modules/version,
but in a staging area, you can specify a basedir which is
prepended to the directory name. This basedir is stripped
from the resulting modules.dep file, so it is ready to be
moved into the normal location.</p>

<p>-C --config file or directory This option overrides the
default configuration file at /etc/depmod.conf (or the
/etc/depmod.d/ directory if that is not found).</p>

<p>-e --errsyms When combined with the -F option, this
reports any symbols which a module needs which are not
supplied by other modules or the kernel. Normally, any
symbols not provided by modules are assumed to be provided
by the kernel (which should be true in a perfect world).</p>

<p>-F --filesyms System.map Supplied with the System.map
produced when the kernel was built, this allows the -e
option to report unresolved symbols.</p>

<p>-h --help Print the help message and exit.</p>

<p>-n --dry-run This sends the resulting modules.dep and
the various map files to standard output rather than writing
them into the module directory.</p>

<p>-v --verbose In verbose mode, depmod will print (to
stdout) all the symbols each module depends on and the
modules file name which provides that symbol.</p>

<p>-V --version Show version of program and exit. See below
for caveats when run on older kernels.</p>
