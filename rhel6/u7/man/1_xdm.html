<p>NAME xdm - X Display Manager with support for XDMCP,
host chooser</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xdm [ -config configuration_file ] [ -nodaemon
] [ -debug debug_level ] [ -error error_log_file ] [
-resources resource_file ] [ -server server_entry ] [
-session session_program ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xdm manages a collection of X displays,
which may be on the local host or remote servers. The design
of xdm was guided by the needs of X ter- minals as well as
The Open Group standard XDMCP, the X Display Manager Control
Protocol. Xdm provides services similar to those provided by
init, getty and login on character terminals: prompting for
login name and password, authenticating the user, and
running a session.</p>

<p>A session is defined by the lifetime of a particular
process; in the traditional character-based terminal world,
it is the users login shell. In the xdm context, it is an
arbitrary session manager. This is because in a windowing
environment, a user s login shell process does not
necessarily have any terminal-like interface with which to
connect. When a real session manager is not available, a
window man- ager or terminal emulator is typically used as
the session manager, meaning that termination of this
process terminates the users session.</p>

<p>When the session is terminated, xdm resets the X server
and (option- ally) restarts the whole process.</p>

<p>When xdm receives an Indirect query via XDMCP, it can
run a chooser process to perform an XDMCP BroadcastQuery (or
an XDMCP Query to speci- fied hosts) on behalf of the
display and offer a menu of possible hosts that offer XDMCP
display management. This feature is useful with X terminals
that do not offer a host menu themselves.</p>

<p>Xdm can be configured to ignore BroadcastQuery messages
from selected hosts. This is useful when you dont want the
host to appear in menus produced by chooser or X terminals
themselves.</p>

<p>Because xdm provides the first interface that users will
see, it is designed to be simple to use and easy to
customize to the needs of a particular site. Xdm has many
options, most of which have reasonable defaults. Browse
through the various sections of this manual, picking and
choosing the things you want to change. Pay particular
attention to the Session Program section, which will
describe how to set up the style of session desired.</p>

<p>OVERVIEW xdm is highly configurable, and most of its
behavior can be controlled by resource files and shell
scripts. The names of these files them- selves are resources
read from the file xdm-config or the file named by the
-config option.</p>

<p>xdm offers display management two different ways. It can
manage X servers running on the local machine and specified
in Xservers, and it can manage remote X servers (typically X
terminals) using XDMCP (the XDM Control Protocol) as
specified in the Xaccess file.</p>

<p>The resources of the X clients run by xdm outside the
users session, including xdm s own login window, can be
affected by setting resources in the Xresources file.</p>

<p>For X terminals that do not offer a menu of hosts to get
display management from, xdm can collect willing hosts and
run the chooser pro- gram to offer the user a menu. For X
displays attached to a host, this step is typically not
used, as the local host does the display manage- ment.</p>

<p>After resetting the X server, xdm runs the Xsetup script
to assist in setting up the screen the user sees along with
the xlogin widget.</p>

<p>The xlogin widget, which xdm presents, offers the
familiar login and password prompts.</p>

<p>After the user logs in, xdm runs the Xstartup script as
root.</p>

<p>Then xdm runs the Xsession script as the user. This
system session file may do some additional startup and
typically runs the .xsession script in the users home
directory. When the Xsession script exits, the session is
over.</p>

<p>At the end of the session, the Xreset script is run to
clean up, the X server is reset, and the cycle starts
over.</p>

<p>The file /var/log/xdm.log will contain error messages
from xdm and anything output to stderr by Xsetup, Xstartup,
Xsession or Xreset. When you have trouble getting xdm
working, check this file to see if xdm has any clues to the
trouble.</p>

<p>OPTIONS All of these options, except -config itself,
specify values that can also be specified in the
configuration file as resources.</p>

<p>-config configuration_file Names the configuration file,
which specifies resources to con- trol the behavior of xdm.
/etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config is the default. See the section
Configuration File.</p>

<p>-nodaemon Specifies false as the value for the
DisplayManager.daemon- Mode resource. This suppresses the
normal daemon behavior, which is for xdm to close all file
descriptors, disassociate itself from the controlling
terminal, and put itself in the background when it first
starts up.</p>

<p>-debug debug_level Specifies the numeric value for the
DisplayManager.debugLevel resource. A non-zero value causes
xdm to print lots of debug- ging statements to the terminal;
it also disables the Display- Manager.daemonMode resource,
forcing xdm to run synchronously. To interpret these
debugging messages, a copy of the source code for xdm is
almost a necessity. No attempt has been made to rationalize
or standardize the output.</p>

<p>-error error_log_file Specifies the value for the
DisplayManager.errorLogFile resource. This file contains
errors from xdm as well as any- thing written to stderr by
the various scripts and programs run during the progress of
the session.</p>

<p>-resources resource_file Specifies the value for the
DisplayManager*resources resource. This file is loaded using
xrdb(1) to specify configuration parameters for the
authentication widget.</p>

<p>-server server_entry Specifies the value for the
DisplayManager.servers resource. See the section Local
Server Specification for a description of this resource.</p>

<p>-udpPort port_number Specifies the value for the
DisplayManager.requestPort resource. This sets the
port-number which xdm will monitor for XDMCP requests. As
XDMCP uses the registered well-known UDP port 177, this
resource should not be changed except for debugging. If set
to 0 xdm will not listen for XDMCP or Chooser requests.</p>

<p>-session session_program Specifies the value for the
DisplayManager*session resource. This indicates the program
to run as the session after the user has logged in.</p>

<p>-xrm resource_specification Allows an arbitrary resource
to be specified, as in most X Toolkit applications.</p>

<p>RESOURCES At many stages the actions of xdm can be
controlled through the use of its configuration file, which
is in the X resource format. Some resources modify the
behavior of xdm on all displays, while others mod- ify its
behavior on a single display. Where actions relate to a spe-
cific display, the display name is inserted into the
resource name between DisplayManager and the final resource
name segment.</p>

<p>For local displays, the resource name and class are as
read from the Xservers file.</p>

<p>For remote displays, the resource name is what the
network address of the display resolves to. See the
removeDomain resource. The name must match exactly; xdm is
not aware of all the network aliases that might reach a
given display. If the name resolve fails, the address is
used. The resource class is as sent by the display in the
XDMCP Manage request.</p>

<p>Because the resource manager uses colons to separate the
name of the resource from its value and dots to separate
resource name parts, xdm substitutes underscores for both
dots and colons when generating the resource name. For
example, DisplayManager.expo_x_org_0.startup is the name of
the resource which defines the startup shell file for the
expo.x.org:0 display.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.servers This resource either specifies a
file name full of server entries, one per line (if the value
starts with a slash), or a single server entry. See the
section Local Server Specification for the details.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.requestPort This indicates the UDP port
number which xdm uses to listen for incoming XDMCP requests.
Unless you need to debug the system, leave this with its
default value of 177.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.errorLogFile Error output is normally
directed at the system console. To redirect it, set this
resource to a file name. A method to send these messages to
syslog should be developed for systems which support it;
however, the wide variety of interfaces precludes any
system-independent implementation. This file also contains
any output directed to stderr by the Xsetup, Xstartup,
Xsession and Xreset files, so it will contain descriptions
of problems in those scripts as well.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.debugLevel If the integer value of this
resource is greater than zero, reams of debugging
information will be printed. It also disables daemon mode,
which would redirect the information into the bit-bucket,
and allows non-root users to run xdm, which would normally
not be useful.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.daemonMode Normally, xdm attempts to make
itself into a daemon process unassociated with any terminal.
This is accomplished by forking and leaving the parent
process to exit, then closing file descriptors and releasing
the controlling terminal. In some environments this is not
desired (in particular, when debug- ging). Setting this
resource to false will disable this feature.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.pidFile The filename specified will be
created to contain an ASCII rep- resentation of the
process-id of the main xdm process. Xdm also uses file
locking on this file to attempt to eliminate multiple
daemons running on the same machine, which would cause quite
a bit of havoc.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.lockPidFile This is the resource which
controls whether xdm uses file lock- ing to keep multiple
display managers from running amok. On System V, this uses
the lockf library call, while on BSD it uses flock.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.authDir This names a directory under
which xdm stores authorization files while initializing the
session. The default value is /etc/X11/xdm. Can be
overridden for specific displays by Dis-
playManager.DISPLAY.authFile.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.autoRescan This boolean controls whether
xdm rescans the configuration, servers, access control and
authentication keys files after a session terminates and the
files have changed. By default it is true. You can force xdm
to reread these files by sending a SIGHUP to the main
process.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.removeDomainname When computing the
display name for XDMCP clients, the name resolver will
typically create a fully qualified host name for the
terminal. As this is sometimes confusing, xdm will remove
the domain name portion of the host name if it is the same
as the domain name of the local host when this variable is
set. By default the value is true.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.keyFile XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1 style XDMCP
authentication requires that a private key be shared between
xdm and the terminal. This resource specifies the file
containing those values. Each entry in the file consists of
a display name and the shared key. By default, xdm does not
include support for XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1, as it requires DES
which is not generally distributable because of United
States export restrictions.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.accessFile To prevent unauthorized XDMCP
service and to allow forwarding of XDMCP IndirectQuery
requests, this file contains a database of hostnames which
are either allowed direct access to this machine, or have a
list of hosts to which queries should be for- warded to. The
format of this file is described in the section XDMCP Access
Control.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.exportList A list of additional
environment variables, separated by white space, to pass on
to the Xsetup, Xstartup, Xsession, and Xreset programs.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.randomFile A file to checksum to generate
the seed of authorization keys. This should be a file that
changes frequently. The default is /dev/mem.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.randomDevice A file to read 8 bytes from
to generate the seed of authoriza- tion keys. The default is
&quot;/dev/urandom&quot; . If this file cannot be read, or
if a read blocks for more than 5 seconds, xdm falls back to
using a checksum of DisplayManager.randomFile to gener- ate
the seed.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.prngdSocket</p>

<p>DisplayManager.prngPort A UNIX domain socket name or a
TCP socket port number on local host on which a
Pseudo-Random Number Generator Daemon, like EGD
(http://egd.sourceforge.net) is listening, in order to
generate the autorization keys. Either a non null port or a
valid socket name must be specified. The default is to use
the Unix-domain socket /tmp/entropy.</p>

<p>On systems that dont have such a daemon, a fall-back
entropy gathering system, based on various log file contents
hashed by the MD5 algorithm is used instead.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.greeterLib On systems that support a
dynamically-loadable greeter library, the name of the
library. The default is /etc/X11/xdm/libXdmGreet.so.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.choiceTimeout Number of seconds to wait
for display to respond after user has selected a host from
the chooser. If the display sends an XDMCP IndirectQuery
within this time, the request is forwarded to the chosen
host. Otherwise, it is assumed to be from a new session and
the chooser is offered again. Default is 15.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.sourceAddress Use the numeric IP address
of the incoming connection on multi- homed hosts instead of
the host name. This is to avoid trying to connect on the
wrong interface which might be down at this time.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.willing This specifies a program which is
run (as) root when an an XDMCP BroadcastQuery is received
and this host is configured to offer XDMCP display
management. The output of this program may be dis- played on
a chooser window. If no program is specified, the string
Willing to manage is sent.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resources This resource specifies
the name of the file to be loaded by xrdb as the resource
database onto the root window of screen 0 of the display.
The Xsetup program, the Login widget, and chooser will use
the resources set in this file. This resource data base is
loaded just before the authentication procedure is started,
so it can control the appearance of the login window. See
the section Authentication Widget, which describes the vari-
ous resources that are appropriate to place in this file.
There is no default value for this resource, but
/etc/X11/xdm/Xresources is the conventional name.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.chooser Specifies the program run
to offer a host menu for Indirect queries redirected to the
special host name CHOOSER. /usr/lib64/X11/xdm/chooser is the
default. See the sections XDMCP Access Control and
Chooser.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.xrdb Specifies the program used
to load the resources. By default, xdm uses
/usr/bin/xrdb.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.cpp This specifies the name of
the C preprocessor which is used by xrdb.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.setup This specifies a program
which is run (as root) before offering the Login window.
This may be used to change the appearance of the screen
around the Login window or to put up other windows (e.g.,
you may want to run xconsole here). By default, no pro- gram
is run. The conventional name for a file used here is
Xsetup. See the section Setup Program.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.startup This specifies a program
which is run (as root) after the authentication process
succeeds. By default, no program is run. The conventional
name for a file used here is Xstartup. See the section
Startup Program.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.session This specifies the
session to be executed (not running as root). By default,
/usr/bin/xterm is run. The conventional name is Xsession.
See the section Session Program.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.reset This specifies a program
which is run (as root) after the ses- sion terminates. By
default, no program is run. The conven- tional name is
Xreset. See the section Reset Program.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.openDelay</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.openRepeat</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.openTimeout</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.startAttempts These numeric
resources control the behavior of xdm when attempting to
open intransigent servers. openDelay is the length of the
pause (in seconds) between successive attempts, openRepeat
is the number of attempts to make, openTimeout is the amount
of time to wait while actually attempting the open (i.e.,
the maximum time spent in the connect(2) system call) and
star- tAttempts is the number of times this entire process
is done before giving up on the server. After openRepeat
attempts have been made, or if openTimeout seconds elapse in
any particular attempt, xdm terminates and restarts the
server, attempting to connect again. This process is
repeated startAttempts times, at which point the display is
declared dead and disabled. Although this behavior may seem
arbitrary, it has been empirically devel- oped and works
quite well on most systems. The default values are 5 for
openDelay, 5 for openRepeat, 30 for openTimeout and 4 for
startAttempts.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.pingInterval</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.pingTimeout To discover when
remote displays disappear, xdm occasionally pings them,
using an X connection and XSync calls. pingInterval
specifies the time (in minutes) between each ping attempt,
ping- Timeout specifies the maximum amount of time (in
minutes) to wait for the terminal to respond to the request.
If the termi- nal does not respond, the session is declared
dead and termi- nated. By default, both are set to 5
minutes. If you fre- quently use X terminals which can
become isolated from the man- aging host, you may wish to
increase this value. The only worry is that sessions will
continue to exist after the terminal has been accidentally
disabled. xdm will not ping local displays. Although it
would seem harmless, it is unpleasant when the work- station
session is terminated as a result of the server hanging for
NFS service and not responding to the ping.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.terminateServer This boolean
resource specifies whether the X server should be terminated
when a session terminates (instead of resetting it). This
option can be used when the server tends to grow without
bound over time, in order to limit the amount of time the
server is run. The default value is false.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.userPath Xdm sets the PATH
environment variable for the session to this value. It
should be a colon separated list of directories; see sh(1)
for a full description. :/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb is
a common setting. The default value can be specified at
build time in the X system configuration file with
DefaultUserPath.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemPath Xdm sets the PATH
environment variable for the startup and reset scripts to
the value of this resource. The default for this resource is
specified at build time by the DefaultSystemPath entry in
the system configuration file;
/etc:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb is a common choice.
Note the absence of . from this entry. This is a good prac-
tice to follow for root; it avoids many common Trojan Horse
sys- tem penetration schemes.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemShell Xdm sets the SHELL
environment variable for the startup and reset scripts to
the value of this resource. It is /bin/sh by default.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.failsafeClient If the default
session fails to execute, xdm will fall back to this
program. This program is executed with no arguments, but
executes using the same environment variables as the session
would have had (see the section Session Program). By
default, /usr/bin/xterm is used.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.grabServer</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.grabTimeout To improve security,
xdm grabs the server and keyboard while reading the login
name and password. The grabServer resource specifies if the
server should be held for the duration of the name/password
reading. When false, the server is ungrabbed after the
keyboard grab succeeds, otherwise the server is grabbed
until just before the session begins. The default is false.
The grabTimeout resource specifies the maximum time xdm will
wait for the grab to succeed. The grab may fail if some
other client has the server grabbed, or possibly if the
network latencies are very high. This resource has a default
value of 3 seconds; you should be cautious when raising it,
as a user can be spoofed by a look-alike window on the
display. If the grab fails, xdm kills and restarts the
server (if possible) and the session.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authorize</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authName authorize is a boolean
resource which controls whether xdm gen- erates and uses
authorization for the local server connections. If
authorization is used, authName is a list of authorization
mechanisms to use, separated by white space. XDMCP
connections dynamically specify which authorization
mechanisms are sup- ported, so authName is ignored in this
case. When authorize is set for a display and authorization
is not available, the user is informed by having a different
message displayed in the login widget. By default, authorize
is true. authName is MIT- MAGIC-COOKIE-1, or, if
XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 is available, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authFile This file is used to
communicate the authorization data from xdm to the server,
using the -auth server command line option. It should be
kept in a directory which is not world-writable as it could
easily be removed, disabling the authorization mechanism in
the server. If not specified, a name is generated from Dis-
playManager.authDir and the name of the display.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authComplain If set to false,
disables the use of the unsecureGreeting in the login
window. See the section Authentication Widget. The default
is true.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resetSignal The number of the
signal xdm sends to reset the server. See the section
Controlling the Server. The default is 1 (SIGHUP).</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.termSignal The number of the
signal xdm sends to terminate the server. See the section
Controlling the Server. The default is 15 (SIGTERM).</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resetForAuth The original
implementation of authorization in the sample server reread
the authorization file at server reset time, instead of when
checking the initial connection. As xdm gener- ates the
authorization information just before connecting to the
display, an old server would not get up-to-date
authorization information. This resource causes xdm to send
SIGHUP to the server after setting up the file, causing an
additional server reset to occur, during which time the new
authorization informa- tion will be read. The default is
false, which will work for all MIT servers.</p>

<p>DisplayManager.DISPLAY.userAuthDir When xdm is unable to
write to the usual user authorization file
($HOME/.Xauthority), it creates a unique file name in this
directory and points the environment variable XAUTHORITY at
the created file. It uses /tmp by default.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE First, the xdm configuration file
should be set up. Make a directory (usually /etc/X11/xdm) to
contain all of the relevant files.</p>

<p>Here is a reasonable configuration file, which could be
named xdm-con- fig:</p>

<p>DisplayManager.servers: /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers
DisplayManager.errorLogFile: /var/log/xdm.log
DisplayManager*resources: /etc/X11/xdm/Xresources
DisplayManager*startup: /etc/X11/xdm/Xstartup
DisplayManager*session: /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession
DisplayManager.pidFile: /var/run/xdm-pid
DisplayManager._0.authorize: true DisplayManager*authorize:
false</p>

<p>Note that this file mostly contains references to other
files. Note also that some of the resources are specified
with * separating the components. These resources can be
made unique for each different dis- play, by replacing the *
with the display-name, but normally this is not very useful.
See the Resources section for a complete discussion.</p>

<p>XDMCP ACCESS CONTROL The database file specified by the
DisplayManager.accessFile provides information which xdm
uses to control access from displays requesting XDMCP
service. This file contains three types of entries: entries
which control the response to Direct and Broadcast queries,
entries which control the response to Indirect queries, and
macro definitions.</p>

<p>The format of the Direct entries is simple, either a
host name or a pattern, which is distinguished from a host
name by the inclusion of one or more meta characters (*
matches any sequence of 0 or more characters, and ? matches
any single character) which are compared against the host
name of the display device. If the entry is a host name, all
comparisons are done using network addresses, so any name
which converts to the correct network address may be used.
For pat- terns, only canonical host names are used in the
comparison, so ensure that you do not attempt to match
aliases. Preceding either a host name or a pattern with a !
character causes hosts which match that entry to be
excluded.</p>

<p>To only respond to Direct queries for a host or pattern,
it can be fol- lowed by the optional NOBROADCAST keyword.
This can be used to prevent an xdm server from appearing on
menus based on Broadcast queries.</p>

<p>An Indirect entry also contains a host name or pattern,
but follows it with a list of host names or macros to which
indirect queries should be sent.</p>

<p>A macro definition contains a macro name and a list of
host names and other macros that the macro expands to. To
distinguish macros from hostnames, macro names start with a
% character. Macros may be nested.</p>

<p>Indirect entries may also specify to have xdm run
chooser to offer a menu of hosts to connect to. See the
section Chooser.</p>

<p>When checking access for a particular display host, each
entry is scanned in turn and the first matching entry
determines the response. Direct and Broadcast entries are
ignored when scanning for an Indirect entry and
vice-versa.</p>

<p>Blank lines are ignored, # is treated as a comment
delimiter causing the rest of that line to be ignored, and
newline causes the newline to be ignored, allowing indirect
host lists to span multiple lines.</p>

<p>Here is an example Xaccess file:</p>

<p># # Xaccess - XDMCP access control file #</p>

<p># # Direct/Broadcast query entries #</p>

<p>!xtra.lcs.mit.edu # disallow direct/broadcast service
for xtra bambi.ogi.edu # allow access from this particular
display *.lcs.mit.edu # allow access from any display in
LCS</p>

<p>*.deshaw.com NOBROADCAST # allow only direct access
*.gw.com # allow direct and broadcast</p>

<p># # Indirect query entries #</p>

<p>%HOSTS expo.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu
excess.lcs.mit.edu kanga.lcs.mit.edu</p>

<p>extract.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu #force extract to
contact xenon !xtra.lcs.mit.edu dummy #disallow indirect
access *.lcs.mit.edu %HOSTS #all others get to choose</p>

<p>If compiled with IPv6 support, multicast address groups
may also be included in the list of addresses indirect
queries are set to. Multi- cast addresses may be followed by
an optional / character and hop count. If no hop count is
specified, the multicast hop count defaults to 1, keeping
the packet on the local network. For IPv4 multicasting, the
hop count is used as the TTL.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>rincewind.sample.net ff02::1 #IPv6 Multicast to ff02::1
#with a hop count of 1 ponder.sample.net CHOOSER
239.192.1.1/16 #Offer a menu of hosts #who respond to IPv4
Multicast # to 239.192.1.1 with a TTL of 16</p>

<p>CHOOSER For X terminals that do not offer a host menu
for use with Broadcast or Indirect queries, the chooser
program can do this for them. In the Xaccess file, specify
CHOOSER as the first entry in the Indirect host list.
Chooser will send a Query request to each of the remaining
host names in the list and offer a menu of all the hosts
that respond.</p>

<p>The list may consist of the word BROADCAST, in which
case chooser will send a Broadcast instead, again offering a
menu of all hosts that respond. Note that on some operating
systems, UDP packets cannot be broadcast, so this feature
will not work.</p>

<p>Example Xaccess file using chooser:</p>

<p>extract.lcs.mit.edu CHOOSER %HOSTS #offer a menu of
these hosts xtra.lcs.mit.edu CHOOSER BROADCAST #offer a menu
of all hosts</p>

<p>The program to use for chooser is specified by the
DisplayManager.DIS- PLAY.chooser resource. For more
flexibility at this step, the chooser could be a shell
script. Chooser is the session manager here; it is run
instead of a child xdm to manage the display.</p>

<p>Resources for this program can be put into the file
named by Display- Manager.DISPLAY.resources.</p>

<p>When the user selects a host, chooser prints the host
chosen, which is read by the parent xdm, and exits. xdm
closes its connection to the X server, and the server resets
and sends another Indirect XDMCP request. xdm remembers the
user s choice (for DisplayManager.choiceTimeout sec- onds)
and forwards the request to the chosen host, which starts a
ses- sion on that display.</p>

<p>LISTEN The following configuration directive is also
defined for the Xaccess configuration file:</p>

<p>LISTEN interface [list of multicast group addresses]
interface may be a hostname or IP addresss representing a
net- work interface on this machine, or the wildcard * to
represent all available network interfaces.</p>

<p>If one or more LISTEN lines are specified, xdm only
listens for XDMCP connections on the specified interfaces.
If multicast group addresses are listed on a listen line,
xdm joins the multicast groups on the given interface.</p>

<p>If no LISTEN lines are given, the original behavior of
listening on all interfaces is preserved for backwards
compatibility. Additionally, if no LISTEN is specified, xdm
joins the default XDMCP IPv6 multicast group, when compiled
with IPv6 support.</p>

<p>To disable listening for XDMCP connections altogther, a
line of LISTEN with no addresses may be specified, or the
previously supported method of setting
DisplayManager.requestPort to 0 may be used.</p>

<p>Examples: LISTEN * ff02::1 # Listen on all interfaces
and to the # ff02::1 IPv6 multicast group. LISTEN
10.11.12.13 # Listen only on this interface, as long # as no
other listen directives appear in # file.</p>

<p>IPv6 MULTICAST ADDRESS SPECIFICATION The Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority has has assigned
ff0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12b as the permanently assigned range of
multicast addresses for XDMCP. The X in the prefix may be
replaced by any valid scope identifier, such as 1 for
Node-Local, 2 for Link-Local, 5 for Site-Local, and so on.
(See IETF RFC 2373 or its replacement for fur- ther details
and scope definitions.) xdm defaults to listening on the
Link-Local scope address ff02:0:0:0:0:0:0:12b to most
closely match the old IPv4 subnet broadcast behavior.</p>

<p>LOCAL SERVER SPECIFICATION The resource
DisplayManager.servers gives a server specification or, if
the values starts with a slash (/), the name of a file
containing server specifications, one per line.</p>

<p>Each specification indicates a display which should
constantly be man- aged and which is not using XDMCP. This
method is used typically for local servers only. If the
resource or the file named by the resource is empty, xdm
will offer XDMCP service only.</p>

<p>Each specification consists of at least three parts: a
display name, a display class, a display type, and (for
local servers) a command line to start the server. A typical
entry for local display number 0 would be:</p>

<p>:0 Digital-QV local /usr/bin/X :0</p>

<p>The display types are:</p>

<p>local local display: xdm must run the server foreign
remote display: xdm opens an X connection to a running
server</p>

<p>The display name must be something that can be passed in
the -display option to an X program. This string is used to
generate the display- specific resource names, so be careful
to match the names (e.g., use :0 Sun-CG3 local /usr/bin/X :0
instead of localhost:0 Sun-CG3 local /usr/bin/X :0 if your
other resources are specified as Dis- playManager._0.session
). The display class portion is also used in the
display-specific resources, as the class of the resource.
This is useful if you have a large collection of similar
displays (such as a corral of X terminals) and would like to
set resources for groups of them. When using XDMCP, the
display is required to specify the display class, so the
manual for your particular X terminal should document the
display class string for your device. If it doesnt, you can
run xdm in debug mode and look at the resource strings which
it generates for that device, which will include the class
string.</p>

<p>When xdm starts a session, it sets up authorization data
for the server. For local servers, xdm passes -auth filename
on the server s command line to point it at its
authorization data. For XDMCP servers, xdm passes the
authorization data to the server via the Accept XDMCP
request.</p>

<p>RESOURCES FILE The Xresources file is loaded onto the
display as a resource database using xrdb. As the
authentication widget reads this database before starting
up, it usually contains parameters for that widget:</p>

<p>xlogin*login.translations: #overrideCtrl&lt;Key&gt;R:
abort-display()0Key&gt;F1: set-session-argument(failsafe)
finish-field()0Key&gt;Return: set-session-argument()
finish-field()</p>

<p>xlogin*borderWidth: 3 xlogin*greeting: CLIENTHOST #ifdef
COLOR xlogin*greetColor: CadetBlue xlogin*failColor: red
#endif</p>

<p>Please note the translations entry; it specifies a few
new translations for the widget which allow users to escape
from the default session (and avoid troubles that may occur
in it). Note that if #override is not specified, the default
translations are removed and replaced by the new value, not
a very useful result as some of the default translations are
quite useful (such as &lt;Key&gt;: insert-char () which
responds to normal typing).</p>

<p>This file may also contain resources for the setup
program and chooser.</p>

<p>SETUP PROGRAM The Xsetup file is run after the server is
reset, but before the Login window is offered. The file is
typically a shell script. It is run as root, so should be
careful about security. This is the place to change the root
background or bring up other windows that should appear on
the screen along with the Login widget.</p>

<p>In addition to any specified by
DisplayManager.exportList, the follow- ing environment
variables are passed:</p>

<p>DISPLAY the associated display name PATH the value of
DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemPath SHELL the value of
DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemShell XAUTHORITY may be set to
an authority file</p>

<p>Note that since xdm grabs the keyboard, any other
windows will not be able to receive keyboard input. They
will be able to interact with the mouse, however; beware of
potential security holes here. If Display-
Manager.DISPLAY.grabServer is set, Xsetup will not be able
to connect to the display at all. Resources for this program
can be put into the file named by
DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resources.</p>

<p>Here is a sample Xsetup script:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh # Xsetup_0 - setup script for one workstation
xcmsdb &lt; /etc/X11/xdm/monitors/alex.0 xconsole -geometry
480x130-0-0 -notify -verbose -exitOnFail &amp;</p>

<p>AUTHENTICATION WIDGET The authentication widget prompts
the user for the username, password, and/or other required
authentication data from the keyboard. Nearly every
imaginable parameter can be controlled with a resource.
Resources for this widget should be put into the file named
by Display- Manager.DISPLAY.resources. All of these have
reasonable default val- ues, so it is not necessary to
specify any of them.</p>

<p>The resource file is loaded with xrdb(1) so it may use
the substitu- tions defined by that program such as
CLIENTHOST for the client host- name in the login message,
or C pre-processor #ifdef statements to pro- duce different
displays depending on color depth or other variables.</p>

<p>Xdm can be compiled with support for the Xft(3) library
for font ren- dering. If this support is present, font faces
are specified using the resources with names ending in
&quot;face&quot; in the fontconfig face format described in
the Font Names section of fonts.conf(5). If not, then fonts
are specified using the resources with names ending in
&quot;font&quot; in the traditional X Logical Font
Description format described in the Font Names section of
X(7).</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.width, xlogin.Login.height, xlogin.Login.x,
xlogin.Login.y The geometry of the Login widget is normally
computed automati- cally. If you wish to position it
elsewhere, specify each of these resources.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.foreground The color used to display the
input typed by the user.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.face The face used to display the input
typed by the user when built with Xft support. The default
is Serif-18.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.font The font used to display the input
typed by the user when not built with Xft support.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.greeting A string which identifies this
window. The default is X Win- dow System.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.unsecureGreeting When X authorization is
requested in the configuration file for this display and
none is in use, this greeting replaces the standard
greeting. The default is This is an unsecure ses- sion</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.greetFace The face used to display the
greeting when built with Xft sup- port. The default is
Serif-24:italic.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.greetFont The font used to display the
greeting when not built with Xft support.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.greetColor The color used to display the
greeting.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.namePrompt The string displayed to prompt
for a user name. Xrdb strips trailing white space from
resource values, so to add spaces at the end of the prompt
(usually a nice thing), add spaces escaped with backslashes.
The default is Login:</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.passwdPrompt The string displayed to prompt
for a password, when not using an authentication system such
as PAM that provides its own prompts. The default is
Password:</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.promptFace The face used to display prompts
when built with Xft support. The default is
Serif-18:bold.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.promptFont The font used to display prompts
when not built with Xft sup- port.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.promptColor The color used to display
prompts.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.changePasswdMessage A message which is
displayed when the users password has expired. The default
is Password Change Required</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.fail A message which is displayed when the
authentication fails, when not using an authentication
system such as PAM that provides its own prompts. The
default is Login incorrect</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.failFace The face used to display the
failure message when built with Xft support. The default is
Serif-18:bold.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.failFont The font used to display the
failure message when not built with Xft support.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.failColor The color used to display the
failure message.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.failTimeout The number of seconds that the
failure message is displayed. The default is 10.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.logoFileName Name of an XPM format pixmap
to display in the greeter window, if built with XPM support.
The default is no pixmap.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.logoPadding Number of pixels of space
between the logo pixmap and other ele- ments of the greeter
window, if the pixmap is displayed. The default is 5.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.useShape If set to true , when built with
XPM support, attempt to use the X Non-Rectangular Window
Shape Extension to set the window shape. The default is
true.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.hiColor, xlogin.Login.shdColor Raised
appearance bezels may be drawn around the greeter frame and
text input boxes by setting these resources. hiColor is the
highlight color, used on the top and left sides of the
frame, and the bottom and right sides of text input areas.
shdColor is the shadow color, used on the bottom and right
sides of the frame, and the top and left sides of text input
areas. The default for both is the foreground color,
providing a flat appearance.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.frameWidth frameWidth is the width in
pixels of the area around the greeter frame drawn in hiColor
and shdColor.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.innerFramesWidth innerFramesWidth is the
width in pixels of the area around text input areas drawn in
hiColor and shdColor.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.sepWidth sepWidth is the width in pixels of
the bezeled line between the greeting and input areas drawn
in hiColor and shdColor.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.allowRootLogin If set to false, dont allow
root (and any other user with uid = 0) to log in directly.
The default is true .</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.allowNullPasswd If set to true, allow an
otherwise failing password match to succeed if the account
does not require a password at all. The default is false, so
only users that have passwords assigned can log in.</p>

<p>xlogin.Login.translations This specifies the
translations used for the login widget. Refer to the X
Toolkit documentation for a complete discussion on
translations. The default translation table is:</p>

<p>Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;H: delete-previous-character()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;D:delete-character()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;B:move-backward-character()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;F:move-forward-character()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;A:move-to-begining()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;E:move-to-end()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;K:erase-to-end-of-line()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;U:erase-line() 0trl&lt;Key&gt;X:erase-line()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;C:restart-session()
0trl&lt;Key&gt;\:abort-session()
0Key&gt;BackSpace:delete-previous-character()
0Key&gt;Delete:delete-previous-character()
0Key&gt;Return:finish-field() 0Key&gt;:insert-char() .fi</p>

<p>The actions which are supported by the widget are:</p>

<p>delete-previous-character Erases the character before
the cursor.</p>

<p>delete-character Erases the character after the
cursor.</p>

<p>move-backward-character Moves the cursor backward.</p>

<p>move-forward-character Moves the cursor forward.</p>

<p>move-to-begining (Apologies about the spelling error.)
Moves the cursor to the beginning of the editable text.</p>

<p>move-to-end Moves the cursor to the end of the editable
text.</p>

<p>erase-to-end-of-line Erases all text after the
cursor.</p>

<p>erase-line Erases the entire text.</p>

<p>finish-field If the cursor is in the name field,
proceeds to the password field; if the cursor is in the
password field, checks the current name/password pair. If
the name/password pair is valid, xdm starts the session.
Otherwise the failure message is displayed and the user is
prompted again.</p>

<p>abort-session Terminates and restarts the server.</p>

<p>abort-display Terminates the server, disabling it. This
action is not accessible in the default configuration. There
are various reasons to stop xdm on a system console, such as
when shutting the system down, when using xdmshell, to start
another type of server, or to generally access the console.
Sending xdm a SIGHUP will restart the display. See the
section Controlling XDM.</p>

<p>restart-session Resets the X server and starts a new
session. This can be used when the resources have been
changed and you want to test them or when the screen has
been overwritten with system messages.</p>

<p>insert-char Inserts the character typed.</p>

<p>set-session-argument Specifies a single word argument
which is passed to the session at startup. See the section
Session Program.</p>

<p>allow-all-access Disables access control in the server.
This can be used when the .Xauthority file cannot be created
by xdm. Be very careful using this; it might be better to
disconnect the machine from the network before doing
this.</p>

<p>On some systems (OpenBSD) the users shell must be listed
in /etc/shells to allow login through xdm. The normal
password and account expiration dates are enforced too.</p>

<p>STARTUP PROGRAM The Xstartup program is run as root when
the user logs in. It is typi- cally a shell script. Since it
is run as root, Xstartup should be very careful about
security. This is the place to put commands which add
entries to /etc/utmp (the sessreg program may be useful
here), mount users home directories from file servers, or
abort the session if logins are not allowed.</p>

<p>In addition to any specified by
DisplayManager.exportList, the follow- ing environment
variables are passed:</p>

<p>DISPLAY the associated display name HOME the initial
working directory of the user LOGNAME the user name USER the
user name PATH the value of
DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemPath SHELL the value of
DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemShell XAUTHORITY may be set to
an authority file WINDOWPATH may be set to the &quot;window
path&quot; leading to the X server</p>

<p>No arguments are passed to the script. Xdm waits until
this script exits before starting the user session. If the
exit value of this script is non-zero, xdm discontinues the
session and starts another authentication cycle.</p>

<p>The sample Xstartup file shown here prevents login while
the file /etc/nologin exists. Thus this is not a complete
example, but simply a demonstration of the available
functionality.</p>

<p>Here is a sample Xstartup script:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh # # Xstartup # # This program is run as root
after the user is verified # if [ -f /etc/nologin ]; then
xmessage -file /etc/nologin -timeout 30 -center exit 1 fi
sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers $LOGNAME
/etc/X11/xdm/GiveConsole exit 0</p>

<p>SESSION PROGRAM The Xsession program is the command
which is run as the users session. It is run with the
permissions of the authorized user.</p>

<p>In addition to any specified by
DisplayManager.exportList, the follow- ing environment
variables are passed:</p>

<p>DISPLAY the associated display name HOME the initial
working directory of the user LOGNAME the user name USER the
user name PATH the value of DisplayManager.DISPLAY.userPath
SHELL the user s default shell (from getpwnam) XAUTHORITY
may be set to a non-standard authority file KRB5CCNAME may
be set to a Kerberos credentials cache name WINDOWPATH may
be set to the &quot;window path&quot; leading to the X
server</p>

<p>At most installations, Xsession should look in $HOME for
a file .xses- sion, which contains commands that each user
would like to use as a session. Xsession should also
implement a system default session if no user-specified
session exists.</p>

<p>An argument may be passed to this program from the
authentication wid- get using the set-session-argument
action. This can be used to select different styles of
session. One good use of this feature is to allow the user
to escape from the ordinary session when it fails. This
allows users to repair their own .xsession if it fails,
without requir- ing administrative intervention. The example
following demonstrates this feature.</p>

<p>This example recognizes the special failsafe mode,
specified in the translations in the Xresources file, to
provide an escape from the ordinary session. It also
requires that the .xsession file be exe- cutable so we dont
have to guess what shell it wants to use.</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh # # Xsession # # This is the program that is
run as the client # for the display manager.</p>

<p>case $# in 1) case $1 in failsafe) exec xterm -geometry
80x24-0-0 ;; esac esac</p>

<p>startup=$HOME/.xsession resources=$HOME/.Xresources</p>

<p>if [ -f &quot;$startup&quot; ]; then exec
&quot;$startup&quot; else if [ -f &quot;$resources&quot; ];
then xrdb -load &quot;$resources&quot; fi twm &amp; xman
-geometry +10-10 &amp; exec xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls
fi</p>

<p>The users .xsession file might look something like this
example. Dont forget that the file must have execute
permission. #! /bin/csh # no -f in the previous line so
.cshrc gets run to set $PATH twm &amp; xrdb -merge
&quot;$HOME/.Xresources&quot; emacs -geometry +0+50 &amp;
xbiff -geometry -430+5 &amp; xterm -geometry -0+50 -ls</p>

<p>RESET PROGRAM Symmetrical with Xstartup, the Xreset
script is run after the user ses- sion has terminated. Run
as root, it should contain commands that undo the effects of
commands in Xstartup, removing entries from /etc/utmp or
unmounting directories from file servers. The environment
variables that were passed to Xstartup are also passed to
Xreset.</p>

<p>A sample Xreset script: #!/bin/sh # # Xreset # # This
program is run as root after the session ends # sessreg -d
-l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers $LOGNAME
/etc/X11/xdm/TakeConsole exit 0</p>

<p>CONTROLLING THE SERVER Xdm controls local servers using
POSIX signals. SIGHUP is expected to reset the server,
closing all client connections and performing other cleanup
duties. SIGTERM is expected to terminate the server. If
these signals do not perform the expected actions, the
resources DisplayMan- ager.DISPLAY.resetSignal and
DisplayManager.DISPLAY.termSignal can specify alternate
signals.</p>

<p>To control remote terminals not using XDMCP, xdm
searches the window hierarchy on the display and uses the
protocol request KillClient in an attempt to clean up the
terminal for the next session. This may not actually kill
all of the clients, as only those which have created win-
dows will be noticed. XDMCP provides a more sure mechanism;
when xdm closes its initial connection, the session is over
and the terminal is required to close all other
connections.</p>

<p>CONTROLLING XDM Xdm responds to two signals: SIGHUP and
SIGTERM. When sent a SIGHUP, xdm rereads the configuration
file, the access control file, and the servers file. For the
servers file, it notices if entries have been added or
removed. If a new entry has been added, xdm starts a session
on the associated display. Entries which have been removed
are dis- abled immediately, meaning that any session in
progress will be termi- nated without notice and no new
session will be started.</p>

<p>When sent a SIGTERM, xdm terminates all sessions in
progress and exits. This can be used when shutting down the
system.</p>

<p>Xdm attempts to mark its various sub-processes for ps(1)
by editing the command line argument list in place. Because
xdm can t allocate addi- tional space for this task, it is
useful to start xdm with a reasonably long command line
(using the full path name should be enough). Each process
which is servicing a display is marked -display.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL LOCAL DISPLAYS To add an additional local
display, add a line for it to the Xservers file. (See the
section Local Server Specification.)</p>

<p>Examine the display-specific resources in xdm-config
(e.g., DisplayMan- ager._0.authorize) and consider which of
them should be copied for the new display. The default
xdm-config has all the appropriate lines for displays :0 and
:1.</p>

<p>OTHER POSSIBILITIES You can use xdm to run a single
session at a time, using the 4.3 init options or other
suitable daemon by specifying the server on the com- mand
line:</p>

<p>xdm -server :0 SUN-3/60CG4 local /usr/bin/X :0</p>

<p>Or, you might have a file server and a collection of X
terminals. The configuration for this is identical to the
sample above, except the Xservers file would look like</p>

<p>extol:0 VISUAL-19 foreign exalt:0 NCD-19 foreign
explode:0 NCR-TOWERVIEW3000 foreign</p>

<p>This directs xdm to manage sessions on all three of
these terminals. See the section Controlling Xdm for a
description of using signals to enable and disable these
terminals in a manner reminiscent of init(8).</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS One thing that xdm isnt very good at doing
is coexisting with other window systems. To use multiple
window systems on the same hardware, youll probably be more
interested in xinit.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config the default configuration
file</p>

<p>$HOME/.Xauthority user authorization file where xdm
stores keys for clients to read</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/X11/xdm/chooser the default chooser</p>

<p>/usr/bin/xrdb the default resource database loader</p>

<p>/usr/bin/X the default server</p>

<p>/usr/bin/xterm the default session program and failsafe
client</p>

<p>/etc/X11/xdm/A&lt;display&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt; the default
place for authorization files</p>

<p>/tmp/K5C&lt;display&gt; Kerberos credentials cache</p>
