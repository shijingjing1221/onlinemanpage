<p>NAME asciitopgm - convert ASCII graphics into a PGM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS asciitopgm [-d divisor] height width
[asciifile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>asciitopgm reads ASCII data as input and produces a PGM
image with pixel values which are an approximation of the
brightness of the ASCII characters, assuming black-on-white
printing. In other words, a capital M is very dark, a period
is very light, and a space is white.</p>

<p>Obviously, asciitopgm assumes a certain font in
assigning a brightness value to a character.</p>

<p>asciitopgm considers ASCII control characters to be all
white. It assigns special brightnesses to lower case letters
which have nothing to do with what they look like printed.
asciitopgm takes the ASCII character code from the lower 7
bits of each input byte. But it warns you if the most
signficant bit of any input byte is not zero.</p>

<p>Input lines which are fewer than width characters are
automatically padded with spaces.</p>

<p>The divisor value is an integer (decimal) by which the
blackness of an input character is divided; the default
value is 1. You can use this to adjust the brightness of the
output: for example, if the image is too bright, increase
the divisor.</p>

<p>In keeping with (I believe) Fortran line-printer
conventions, input lines beginning with a + (plus) character
are assumed to overstrike the previous line, allowing a
larger range of gray values.</p>

<p>If you re looking for something that creates an image of
text, with that text specified in ASCII, that is something
quite different. Use pbmtext for that.</p>
