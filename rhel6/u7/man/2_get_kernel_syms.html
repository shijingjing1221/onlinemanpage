<p>GET_KERNEL_SYMS(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GET_KERNEL_SYMS(2)</p>

<p>NAME get_kernel_syms - retrieve exported kernel and
module symbols</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;</p>

<p>int get_kernel_syms(struct kernel_sym *table);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If table is NULL, get_kernel_syms() returns
the number of symbols available for query. Otherwise it
fills in a table of structures:</p>

<p>struct kernel_sym { unsigned long value; char name[60];
};</p>

<p>The symbols are interspersed with magic symbols of the
form #module- name with the kernel having an empty name. The
value associated with a symbol of this form is the address
at which the module is loaded.</p>

<p>The symbols exported from each module follow their magic
module tag and the modules are returned in the reverse of
the order in which they were loaded.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, returns the number of symbols
copied to table. On error, -1 is returned and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS There is only one possible error return:</p>

<p>ENOSYS get_kernel_syms() is not supported in this
version of the ker- nel.</p>

<p>VERSIONS This system call is only present on Linux up
until kernel 2.4; it was removed in Linux 2.6.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO get_kernel_syms() is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>BUGS There is no way to indicate the size of the buffer
allocated for table. If symbols have been added to the
kernel since the program queried for the symbol table size,
memory will be corrupted.</p>

<p>The length of exported symbol names is limited to 59
characters.</p>

<p>Because of these limitations, this system call is
deprecated in favor of query_module(2) (which is itself
nowadays deprecated in favor of other interfaces described
on its manual page).</p>

init_module(2), query_module(2)</p>
