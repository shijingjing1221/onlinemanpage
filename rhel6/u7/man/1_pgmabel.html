<p>NAME pgmabel - create cross section using Abel
Integration for Deconvolution</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmabel [-help] [-axis axis] [-factor factor]
[-pixsize pixsize] [-left | -right] [-verbose]
[filespec]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmabel reads as input a PGM image, which it assumes to
be an image of a rotational symmetric transparent object.
The image must have a ver- tical symmetry axis. pgmabel
produces as output an image of a cross- section of the
image.</p>

<p>pgmabel does the calculation by performing the Abel
Integration for Deconvolution of an axial-symmetrical image
by solving the system of linear equations.</p>

<p>After integration, pgmabel weights all gray-values of
one side by the surface area of the calculated ring in
square pixels divided by 4*fac- tor multiplied by the size
of one pixel (pixsize). With the -verbose option, pgmabel
prints the weighting factors.</p>

<p>Where the caculation generates a negative result, the
output is black.</p>

<p>The computation is unstable against periodic structures
with size 2 in the vertical direction.</p>

<p>OPTIONS You can abbreviate any option to its shortest
unique prefix.</p>

<p>-help Prints a help message.</p>

<p>-axis axis Position of the axis of symmetry in the image
in pixels from the left edge of the image. Default is the
center of the image.</p>

<p>-factor factor User defined factor for enhancement of
the output. Use a factor less than 1 for decreasing gary
values. Default is 1.0.</p>

<p>-pixsize pixsize The size of a pixel for getting scale
invariant. Default is 0.1.</p>

<p>-left Calculate only the left side of the image. You
cannot specify both left and right.</p>

<p>-right Analogous to -left.</p>

<p>-verbose print information about the calculation.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE Rotate a PGM image to get an image with a
vertical axis of symmetry, then calculate the cross
section:</p>

<p>pnmrotate 90 file.pgm | pgmabel -axis 140
&gt;cross_section.pgm</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pnmrotate(1), pgm(1),</p>

<p>HISTORY This program was added to Netpbm in Release 10.3
(June 2002).</p>
