<p>MOVE_PAGES(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
MOVE_PAGES(2)</p>

<p>NAME move_pages - move individual pages of a process to
another node</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;numaif.h&gt;</p>

<p>long move_pages(int pid, unsigned long count, void
**pages, const int *nodes, int *status, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION move_pages() moves the specified pages of
the process pid to the memory nodes specified by nodes. The
result of the move is reflected in sta- tus. The flags
indicate constraints on the pages to be moved.</p>

<p>pid is the ID of the process in which pages are to be
moved. To move pages in another process, the caller must be
privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) or the real or effective user ID
of the calling process must match the real or saved-set user
ID of the target process. If pid is 0 then move_pages()
moves pages of the calling process.</p>

<p>count is the number of pages to move. It defines the
size of the three arrays pages, nodes, and status.</p>

<p>pages is an array of pointers to the pages that should
be moved. These are pointers that should be aligned to page
boundaries. Addresses are specified as seen by the process
specified by pid.</p>

<p>nodes is an array of integers that specify the desired
location for each page. Each element in the array is a node
number. nodes can also be NULL, in which case move_pages()
does not move any pages but instead will return the node
where each page currently resides, in the status array.
Obtaining the status of each page may be necessary to
determine pages that need to be moved.</p>

<p>status is an array of integers that return the status of
each page. The array only contains valid values if
move_pages() did not return an error.</p>

<p>flags specify what types of pages to move. MPOL_MF_MOVE
means that only pages that are in exclusive use by the
process are to be moved. MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL means that pages
shared between multiple processes can also be moved. The
process must be privileged (CAP_SYS_NICE) to use
MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL.</p>

<p>Page states in the status array The following values can
be returned in each element of the status array.</p>

<p>0..MAX_NUMNODES Identifies the node on which the page
resides.</p>

<p>-EACCES The page is mapped by multiple processes and can
only be moved if MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL is specified.</p>

<p>-EBUSY The page is currently busy and cannot be moved.
Try again later. This occurs if a page is undergoing I/O or
another ker- nel subsystem is holding a reference to the
page.</p>

<p>-EFAULT This is a zero page or the memory area is not
mapped by the pro- cess.</p>

<p>-EIO Unable to write back a page. The page has to be
written back in order to move it since the page is dirty and
the file system does not provide a migration function that
would allow the move of dirty pages.</p>

<p>-EINVAL A dirty page cannot be moved. The file system
does not provide a migration function and has no ability to
write back pages.</p>

<p>-ENOENT The page is not present.</p>

<p>-ENOMEM Unable to allocate memory on target node.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success move_pages() returns zero. On
error, it returns -1, and sets errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS E2BIG Too many pages to move.</p>

<p>EACCES One of the target nodes is not allowed by the
current cpuset.</p>

<p>EFAULT Parameter array could not be accessed.</p>

<p>EINVAL Flags other than MPOL_MF_MOVE and
MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL was specified or an attempt was made to
migrate pages of a kernel thread.</p>

<p>ENODEV One of the target nodes is not online.</p>

<p>ENOENT No pages were found that require moving. All
pages are either already on the target node, not present,
had an invalid address or could not be moved because they
were mapped by multiple pro- cesses.</p>

<p>EPERM The caller specified MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL without
sufficient privi- leges (CAP_SYS_NICE). Or, the caller
attempted to move pages of a process belonging to another
user but did not have privilege to do so (CAP_SYS_NICE).</p>

<p>ESRCH Process does not exist.</p>

<p>VERSIONS move_pages() first appeared on Linux in version
2.6.18.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES For information on library support, see
numa(7).</p>

<p>Use get_mempolicy(2) with the MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED flag
to obtain the set of nodes that are allowed by the current
cpuset. Note that this information is subject to change at
any time by manual or automatic reconfiguration of the
cpuset.</p>

<p>Use of this function may result in pages whose location
[node] violates the memory policy established for the
specified addresses [See mbind(2)] and/or the specified
process [See set_mempolicy(2)]. That is, memory policy does
not constrain the destination nodes used by
move_pages().</p>
