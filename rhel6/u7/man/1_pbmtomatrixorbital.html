<p>NAME pbmtomatrixorbital - convert a PBM image to a
Matrix Orbital LCD image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtomatrixorbital</p>

<p>[pbmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtomatrixorbital reads a PBM image as input and
produces as output an image that can be uploaded to a Matrix
Orbital LCD display.</p>

<p>You can upload the image to the LCD via the serial port
to which it is connected with the program mo-upload.pl,
which you can get from the package pbmtomatrixorbital. Yes,
the package is the same name as this Netpbm program, and it
contains its own pbmtomatrixorbital program which is
slightly different from this one because it is not part of
the Netpbm package.</p>

<p>HISTORY pbmtomatrixorbital was added to Netpbm in
Release 10.18 (September 2003).</p>
