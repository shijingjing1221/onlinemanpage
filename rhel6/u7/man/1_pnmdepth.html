<p>NAME pnmdepth - change the maxval in a PNM image</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>Starting with Netpbm 10.32 (Februrary 2006), pnmdepth is
obsolete. Use pamdepth(1)instead.</p>

<p>pamdepth is backward compatible with pnmdepth. You can
use the pamdepth manual for pnmdepth as long as you ignore
features that were added after Netpbm 10.31.</p>

<p>For backward compatibility, the name pnmdepth continues
to exist as an alias for pamdepth. But due to a bug, that
name doesnt work in Netpbm 10.32. You have to fix the
symbolic link.</p>
