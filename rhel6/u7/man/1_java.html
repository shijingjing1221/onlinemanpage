<p>Name java - the Java application launcher</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS java [ options ] class [ argument ... ] java [
options ] -jar file.jar [ argument ... ]</p>

<p>options Command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p>class The name of the class to be called.</p>

<p>file.jar The name of the JAR file to be called. Used
only with the -jar command.</p>

<p>argument The arguments passed to the main function.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The java command starts a Java application.
It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading
a specified class, and calling that classs main method.</p>

<p>The method must be declared public and static, it must
not return any value, and it must accept a String array as a
parameter. The method declaration has the following
form:</p>

<p>public static void main(String args[])</p>

<p>By default, the first argument without an option is the
name of the class to be called. A fully qualified class name
should be used. If the -jar option is specified, then the
first non-option argument is the name of a JAR file
containing class and resource files for the applica- tion,
with the startup class indicated by the Main-Class manifest
header.</p>

<p>The Java runtime searches for the startup class, and
other classes used, in three sets of locations: the
bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user
class path.</p>

<p>Non-option arguments after the class name or JAR file
name are passed to the main function.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The launcher has a set of standard options that
are supported in the current runtime environment.</p>

<p>In addition, the current implementations of the virtual
machines sup- port a set of nonstandard options that are
subject to change in future releases. See Nonstandard
Options.</p>

<p>Standard Options -client Selects the Java HotSpot Client
VM. A 64-bit capable JDK cur- rently ignores this option and
instead uses the Java Hotspot Server VM. For default Java VM
selection, see Server-Class Machine Detection at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p>-server Selects the Java HotSpot Server VM. On a 64-bit
capable JDK, only the Java Hotspot Server VM is supported so
the -server option is implicit. For default a Java VM
selection, see Server-Class Machine Detec- tion at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p>-agentlib:libname[=options] Loads native agent library
libname, for example:</p>

<p>-agentlib:hprof</p>

<p>-agentlib:jdwp=help</p>

<p>-agentlib:hprof=help</p>

<p>See JVMTI Agent Command-Line Options at http://docs.ora-
cle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting</p>

<p>-agentpath:pathname[=options] Loads a native agent
library by full pathname. See JVMTI Com- mand-Line Options
at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/plat-
form/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting</p>

<p>-classpath classpath, -cp classpath Specifies a list of
directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives to search for class
files. Separate class path entries with colons (:).
Specifying -classpath or -cp overrides any setting of the
CLASSPATH environment variable. If -classpath and -cp are
not used and CLASSPATH is not set, then the user class path
consists of the current directory (.). As a special
convenience, a class path element that contains a base name
of * is considered equivalent to specifying a list of all
the files in the directory with the extension .jar or .JAR.
A Java program cannot tell the difference between the two
invoca- tions. For example, if directory mydir contains
a.jar and b.JAR, then the class path element mydir/* is
expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR, except that the order of jar
files is unspecified. All jar files in the specified
directory, even hidden ones, are included in the list. A
class path entry consisting simply of * expands to a list of
all the jar files in the current directory. The CLASSPATH
environment variable, where defined, will be similarly
expanded. Any class path wildcard expansion occurs before
the Java VM is started. No Java program will ever see wild
cards that are not expanded except by querying the
environment. For example, by calling
System.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).</p>

<p>-Dproperty=value Sets a system property value.</p>

<p>-d32 Run the application in a 32-bit environment. If a
32-bit environ- ment is not installed or is not supported,
an error will be reported. By default, the application is
run in a 32-bit environ- ment unless a 64-bit only system is
used.</p>

<p>-d64 Run the application in a 64-bit environment. If a
64-bit environ- ment is not installed or is not supported,
an error will be reported. By default, the application is
run in a 32-bit environ- ment unless a 64-bit only system is
used. Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports
64-bit opera- tion, and the -server option is implicit with
the use of -d64. The -client option is ignored with the use
of -d64. This is sub- ject to change in a future
release.</p>

<p>-disableassertions[:package name&quot;...&quot; | :class
name ], -da[:package name&quot;...&quot; | :class name ]
Disable assertions. This is the default. With no arguments,
-disableassertions or -da disables assertions. With one
argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the switch disables
assertions in the specified package and any subpackages. If
the argument is &quot;...&quot;, then the switch disables
assertions in the unnamed package in the current working
directory. With one argument not ending in &quot;...&quot;,
the switch disables assertions in the specified class. To
run a program with assertions enabled in package com.wom-
bat.fruitbat but disabled in class
com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, the following command could be
used:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p>The -disableassertions and -da switches apply to all
class load- ers and to system classes (which do not have a
class loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. The -dis- ablesystemassertions option
provides a separate swith to enable assertions in all system
classes.</p>

<p>-enableassertions[:package name&quot;...&quot; | :class
name ], -ea[:package name&quot;...&quot; | :class name ]
Enable assertions. Assertions are disabled by default. With
no arguments, -enableassertions or -ea enables assertions.
With one argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the switch
enables assertions in the specified package and any
subpackages. If the argument is &quot;...&quot;, then the
switch enables assertions in the unnamed package in the
current working directory. With one argument not ending in
&quot;...&quot;, the switch enables assertions in the
specified class. If a single command contains multiple
instances of these switches, then they are processed in
order before loading any classes. So, for example, to run a
program with assertions enabled only in package
com.wombat.fruitbat (and any subpack- ages), the following
command could be used:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat... &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p>The -enableassertions and -ea switches apply to all
class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a
class loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. The -enablesys- temassertions option
provides a separate switch to enable asser- tions in all
system classes.</p>

<p>-enablesystemassertions, -esa Enable assertions in all
system classes (sets the default asser- tion status for
system classes to true).</p>

<p>-disablesystemassertions, -dsa Disables assertions in
all system classes.</p>

<p>-help or -? Displays usage information and exit.</p>

<p>-jar Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The
first argument is the name of a JAR file instead of a
startup class name. For this option to work, the manifest of
the JAR file must contain a line in the form Main-Class:
classname. Here, classname identi- fies the class with the
public static void main(String[] args) method that serves as
your application s starting point. When you use this option,
the JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other
user class path settings are ignored. JAR files that can be
run with the java -jar option can have their execute
permissions set so they can be run without using java -jar.
See JAR File Overview at http://docs.ora-
cle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html</p>

<p>-javaagent:jarpath[=options] Loads a Java programming
language agent. For more information about instrumenting
Java applications, see the java.lang.instru- ment package
description in the Java API documentation at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instru-
ment/package-summary.html @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instru-
ment/package-summary.html</p>

<p>-jre-restrict-search Includes user-private JREs in the
version search.</p>

<p>-no-jre-restrict-search Excludes user-private JREs in
the version search.</p>

<p>-showversion Displays version information and
continues.</p>

<p>-splash:imagepath Shows splash screen with image
specified by imagepath.</p>

<p>-verbose, -verbose:class Displays information about each
class loaded.</p>

<p>-verbose:gc Reports on each garbage collection
event.</p>

<p>-verbose:jni Reports information about use of native
methods and other Java Native Interface activity.</p>

<p>-version Displays version information and exits. See
also the -showversion option.</p>

<p>-version:release Specifies that the version specified by
the release is required by the class or JAR file specified
on the command line. If the version of the java command
called does not meet this specifica- tion and an appropriate
implementation is found on the system, then the appropriate
implementation will be used. The release option specifies an
exact version and a list of ver- sions called a version
string. A version string is an ordered list of version
ranges separated by spaces. A version range is either a
version-id, a version-id followed by an asterisk (*), a
version-id followed by a plus sign (+), or a version range
that consists of two version-ids combined using an ampersand
(&amp;). The asterisk means prefix match, the plus sign
means this version or greater, and the ampersand means the
logical and of the two ver- sion-ranges, for example:</p>

<p>-version:&quot;1.6.0_13 1.6*&amp;1.6.0_10+&quot;</p>

<p>The meaning of the previous example is that the class or
JAR file requires either version 1.6.0_13, or a version with
1.6 as a ver- sion-id prefix and that is not less than
1.6.0_10. The exact syn- tax and definition of version
strings can be found in Appendix A of the Java Network
Launching Protocol &amp; API Specification (JSR-56). For JAR
files, the preference is to specify version requirements in
the JAR file manifest rather than on the command line. See
Notes for important policy information on the use of this
option.</p>

<p>Non-Standard Options -X Displays information about
nonstandard options and exits.</p>

<p>-Xint Operates in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to
native code is disabled, and all bytecode is executed by the
interpreter. The performance benefits offered by the Java
HotSpot Client VM adap- tive compiler is not present in this
mode.</p>

<p>-Xbatch Disables background compilation. Typically, the
Java VM compiles the method as a background task, running
the method in inter- preter mode until the background
compilation is finished. The -Xbatch flag disables
background compilation so that compilation of all methods
proceeds as a foreground task until completed.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath:bootclasspath Specifies a
colon-separated list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP
archives to search for boot class files. These are used in
place of the boot class files included in the Java platform
JDK. Applications that use this option for the purpose of
overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed because
doing so would contravene the Java Runtime Environment
binary code license.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/a:path Specifies a colon-separated path
of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives to append to the
default bootstrap class path.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/p:path Specifies a colon-separated path
of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives to add in front
of the default bootstrap class path. Do not deploy
applications that use this option to override a class in
rt.jar because this violates the Java Runtime Environ- ment
binary code license.</p>

<p>-Xcheck:jni Performs additional checks for Java Native
Interface (JNI) func- tions. Specifically, the Java Virtual
Machine validates the parameters passed to the JNI function
and the runtime environment data before processing the JNI
request. Any invalid data encoun- tered indicates a problem
in the native code, and the Java Vir- tual Machine will
terminate with a fatal error in such cases. Expect a
performance degradation when this option is used.</p>

<p>-Xfuture Performs strict class-file format checks. For
backward compati- bility, the default format checks
performed by the Java virtual machine are no stricter than
the checks performed by 1.1.x ver- sions of the JDK
software. The -Xfuture option turns on stricter class-file
format checks that enforce closer conformance to the
class-file format specification. Developers are encouraged
to use this flag when developing new code because the
stricter checks will become the default in future releases
of the Java applica- tion launcher.</p>

<p>-Xnoclassgc Disables class garbage collection. Use of
this option preven mem- ory recovery from loaded classes
thus increasing overall memory usage. This could cause
OutOfMemoryError to be thrown in some applications.</p>

<p>-Xincgc Enables the incremental garbage collector. The
incremental garbage collector, which is turned off by
default, will reduce the occasional long garbage-collection
pauses during program exe- cution. The incremental garbage
collector will at times execute concurrently with the
program and during such times will reduce the processor
capacity available to the program.</p>

<p>-Xloggc:file Reports on each garbage collection event,
as with -verbose:gc, but logs this data to a file. In
addition to the information -verbose:gc gives, each reported
event will be preceded by the time (in seconds) since the
first garbage-collection event. Always use a local file
system for storage of this file to avoid stalling the Java
VM due to network latency. The file may be truncated in the
case of a full file system and logging will con- tinue on
the truncated file. This option overrides -verbose:gc when
both are specified on the command line.</p>

<p>-Xmnsize or -XX:NewSize Sets the size of the young
generation (nursery).</p>

<p>-Xmsn Specifies the initial size, in bytes, of the
memory allocation pool. This value must be a multiple of
1024 greater than 1 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default
value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration.
See Garbage Collector Ergonomics at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html Examples:</p>

<p>-Xms6291456 -Xms6144k -Xms6m</p>

<p>-Xmxn Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of the
memory allocation pool. This value must a multiple of 1024
greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default
value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration.
For server deployments, -Xms and -Xmx are often set to the
same value. See Garbage Collector Ergonomics at
http://docs.ora-
cle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html
Examples:</p>

<p>-Xmx83886080 -Xmx81920k -Xmx80m</p>

<p>On Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC platforms, the upper
limit for this value is approximately 4000 m minus overhead
amounts. On Solaris 2.6 and x86 platforms, the upper limit
is approximately 2000 m minus overhead amounts. On Linux
platforms, the upper limit is approximately 2000 m minus
overhead amounts.</p>

<p>-Xprof Profiles the running program, and sends profiling
data to stan- dard output. This option is provided as a
utility that is useful in program development and is not
intended to be used in produc- tion systems.</p>

<p>-Xrs Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java
VM. In an earlier release, the Shutdown Hooks facility was
added to enable orderly shutdown of a Java application. The
intent was to enable user cleanup code (such as closing
database connections) to run at shutdown, even if the Java
VM terminates abruptly. The Java VM catches signals to
implement shutdown hooks for unex- pected Java VM
termination. The Java VM uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM to
initiate the running of shutdown hooks. The JVM uses a
similar mechanism to implement the feature of dumping thread
stacks for debugging purposes. The JVM uses SIGQUIT to
perform thread dumps. Applications embedding the Java VM
frequently need to trap sig- nals such as SIGINT or SIGTERM,
which can lead to interference with the Java VM signal
handlers. The -Xrs command-line option is available to
address this issue. When -Xrs is used on the Java VM, the
signal masks for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are
not changed by the Java VM, and signal handlers for these
signals are not installed. There are two consequences of
specifying -Xrs:</p>

<p>o SIGQUIT thread dumps are not available.</p>

<p>o User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to
run, for example by calling System.exit() when the Java VM
is to be ter- minated.</p>

<p>-Xssn Sets the thread stack size.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocationPrefetchStyle=n Sets the style of prefetch
used during allocation. default=2.</p>

<p>-XX:+AggressiveOpts Enables aggressive optimization.</p>

<p>-XX:+|-DisableAttachMechanism Specifies whether commands
(such as jmap and jconsole) can attach to the Java VM. By
default, this feature is disabled. That is, attaching is
enabled, for example:</p>

<p>java -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism</p>

<p>-XXLargePageSizeInBytes=n Specifies the maximum size for
large pages.</p>

<p>-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=n Sets a target for the maximum GC
pause time. This is a soft goal, and the Java VM will make
its best effort to achieve it. There is no maximum value set
by default.</p>

<p>-XX:NewSize Sets the size of the young generation
(nursery). Sames as -Xmn- size.</p>

<p>-XX:ParallelGCThreads=n Sets the number of GC threads in
the parallel collectors.</p>

<p>-XX:PredictedClassLoadCount=n This option requires that
the UnlockExperimentalVMOptions flag be set first. Use the
PredictedClassLoadCount flag if your applica- tion loads a
lot of classes and especially if class.forName() is used
heavily. The recommended value is the number of classes
loaded as shown in the output from -verbose:class.
Example:</p>

<p>java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
-XX:PredictedClassLoadCount=60013</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintCompilation Prints verbose output from the
Java HotSpot VM dynamic runtime compiler.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps Prints
garbage collection output along with time stamps.</p>

<p>-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=0 This flag enables
aggressive processing of software references. Use this flag
if the software reference count has an impact on the Java
HotSpot VM garbage collector.</p>

<p>-XX:TLABSize=n Thread local allocation buffers (TLAB)
are enabled by default in the Java HotSpot VM. The Java
HotSpot VM sizes TLABs based on allocation patterns. The
-XX:TLABSize option enables fine-tuning the size of
TLABs.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAltSigs The Java VM uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 by
default, which can some- times conflict with applications
that signal-chain SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. The -XX:+UseAltSigs
option causes the Java VM to use signals other than SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 as the default.</p>

<p>-XX:+|-UseCompressedOops Enables compressed references
in 64-bit Java VMs. This option is true by default.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC or -XX:+UseG1GC Enables either
the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) or the G1 garbage
collectors.</p>

<p>-XX:+|-UseLargePages Enables large page support. Large
pages are enabled by default on Solaris.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseParallelOldGC Enables the parallel garbage
collectors, which are optimized for throughput and average
response time.</p>

<p>NOTES The -version:release option places no restrictions
on the complexity of the release specification. However,
only a restricted subset of the possible release
specifications represent sound policy and only these are
fully supported. These policies are:</p>

<p>1. Any version, represented by not using this
option.</p>

<p>2. Any version greater than an arbitrarily precise
version-id value, for example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.6.0_10+&quot;</p>

<p>This would utilize any version greater than 1.6.0_10.
This is useful for a case where an interface was introduced
(or a bug fixed) in the release specified.</p>

<p>3. A version greater than an arbitrarily precise
version-id, bounded by the upper bound of that release
family, for example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.6.0_10+&amp;1.6*&quot;</p>

<p>4. An or expressions of items 2 or 3, for example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.6.0_10+&amp;1.6* 1.7+&quot;</p>

<p>Similar to item 2. This is useful when a change was
introduced in a release (1.7) but also made available in
updates to earlier releases.</p>

<p>Performance Tuning Examples The following examples show
how to use experimental tuning flags to optimize either
throughput or faster response time.</p>

<p>Example 1, Tuning for Higher Throughput java -d64
-server -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseLargePages -Xmn10g
-Xms26g -Xmx26g</p>

<p>Example 2, Tuning for Lower Response Time java -d64
-XX:+UseG1GC -Xms26g Xmx26g -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500
-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are typically
returned by the launcher, typi- cally when the launcher is
called with the wrong arguments, serious errors, or
exceptions thrown from the Java Virtual Machine. However, a
Java application may choose to return any value using the
API call Sys- tem.exit(exitValue).</p>

<p>o 0: Successful completion</p>

<p>o &gt;0: An error occurred</p>
