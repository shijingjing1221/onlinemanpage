<p>NAME ipc - System V IPC system calls</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int ipc(unsigned int call, int first, int
second, int third, void *ptr, long fifth);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ipc() is a common kernel entry point for the
System V IPC calls for messages, semaphores, and shared
memory. call determines which IPC function to invoke; the
other arguments are passed through to the appropriate
call.</p>

<p>User programs should call the appropriate functions by
their usual names. Only standard library implementors and
kernel hackers need to know about ipc().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO ipc() is Linux-specific, and should not be
used in programs intended to be portable.</p>

<p>NOTES On a few architectures, for example ia64, there is
no ipc() system call; instead msgctl(2), semctl(2),
shmctl(2), and so on really are implemented as separate
system calls.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO msgctl(2), msgget(2), msgrcv(2), msgsnd(2),
semctl(2), semget(2), semop(2), semtimedop(2), shmat(2),
shmctl(2), shmdt(2), shmget(2)</p>
