<p>READPROFILE(1) READPROFILE(1)</p>

<p>NAME readprofile - a tool to read kernel profiling
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS readprofile [options]</p>

<p>VERSION This manpage documents version 2.0 of the
program.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The readprofile command uses the
/proc/profile information to print ascii data on standard
output. The output is organized in three columns: the first
is the number of clock ticks, the second is the name of the
C function in the kernel where those many ticks occurred,
and the third is the normalized load of the procedure,
calculated as a ratio between the number of ticks and the
length of the procedure. The output is filled with blanks to
ease readability.</p>

<p>Available command line options are the following:</p>

<p>-m mapfile Specify a mapfile, which by default is
/usr/src/linux/Sys- tem.map. You should specify the map file
on cmdline if your current kernel isnt the last one you
compiled, or if you keep System.map elsewhere. If the name
of the map file ends with .gz it is decompressed on the
fly.</p>

<p>-p pro-file Specify a different profiling buffer, which
by default is /proc/profile. Using a different pro-file is
useful if you want to freeze the kernel profiling at some
time and read it later. The /proc/profile file can be copied
using cat or cp. There is no more support for compressed
profile buffers, like in read- profile-1.1, because the
program needs to know the size of the buffer in advance.</p>

<p>-i Info. This makes readprofile only print the profiling
step used by the kernel. The profiling step is the
resolution of the pro- filing buffer, and is chosen during
kernel configuration (through make config), or in the
kernels command line. If the -t (terse) switch is used
together with -i only the decimal number is printed.</p>

<p>-a Print all symbols in the mapfile. By default the
procedures with 0 reported ticks are not printed.</p>

<p>-b Print individual histogram-bin counts.</p>

<p>-r Reset the profiling buffer. This can only be invoked
by root, because /proc/profile is readable by everybody but
writable only by the superuser. However, you can make
readprofile setuid 0, in order to reset the buffer without
gaining privileges.</p>

<p>-M multiplier On some architectures it is possible to
alter the frequency at which the kernel delivers profiling
interrupts to each CPU. This option allows you to set the
frequency, as a multiplier of the system clock frequency,
HZ. This is supported on i386-SMP (2.2 and 2.4 kernel) and
also on sparc-SMP and sparc64-SMP (2.4 kernel). This option
also resets the profiling buffer, and requires superuser
privileges.</p>

<p>-v Verbose. The output is organized in four columns and
filled with blanks. The first column is the RAM address of a
kernel func- tion, the second is the name of the function,
the third is the number of clock ticks and the last is the
normalized load.</p>

<p>-V Version. This makes readprofile print its version
number and exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Browse the profiling buffer ordering by clock
ticks: readprofile | sort -nr | less</p>

<p>Print the 20 most loaded procedures: readprofile | sort
-nr +2 | head -20</p>

<p>Print only filesystem profile: readprofile | grep
_ext2</p>

<p>Look at all the kernel information, with ram
addresses&quot; readprofile -av | less</p>

<p>Browse a freezed profile buffer for a non current
kernel: readprofile -p ~/profile.freeze -m
/zImage.map.gz</p>

<p>Request profiling at 2kHz per CPU, and reset the
profiling buffer sudo readprofile -M 20</p>

<p>BUGS readprofile only works with an 1.3.x or newer
kernel, because /proc/profile changed in the step from 1.2
to 1.3</p>

<p>This program only works with ELF kernels. The change for
a.out kernels is trivial, and left as an exercise to the
a.out user.</p>

<p>To enable profiling, the kernel must be rebooted,
because no profiling module is available, and it wouldnt be
easy to build. To enable pro- filing, you can specify
&quot;profile=2&quot; (or another number) on the kernel
commandline. The number you specify is the two-exponent used
as pro- filing step.</p>

<p>Profiling is disabled when interrupts are inhibited.
This means that many profiling ticks happen when interrupts
are re-enabled. Watch out for misleading information.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/profile A binary snapshot of the profiling
buffer. /usr/src/linux/System.map The symbol table for the
kernel. /usr/src/linux/* The program being profiled :-)</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY The readprofile command is part of the
util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.</p>
