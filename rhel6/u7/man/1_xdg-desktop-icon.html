<p>XDG-DESKTOP-ICON(1) XDG-DESKTOP-ICON(1)</p>

<p>NAME xdg-desktop-icon - command line tool for
(un)installing icons to the desktop</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xdg-desktop-icon install [--novendor] FILE</p>

<p>xdg-desktop-icon uninstall FILE</p>

<p>xdg-desktop-icon {--help --manual --version}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xdg-desktop-icon program can be used to
install an application launcher or other file on the desktop
of the current user.</p>

<p>An application launcher is represented by a *.desktop
file. Desktop files are defined by the freedesktop.org
Desktop Entry Specification. The most important aspects of
*.desktop files are summarized below.</p>

<p>COMMANDS install Installs FILE to the desktop of the
current user. FILE can be a *.desktop file or any other type
of file.</p>

<p>uninstall Removes FILE from the desktop of the current
user.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --novendor Normally, xdg-desktop-icon checks to
ensure that a *.desktop file to be installed has a vendor
prefix. This option can be used to disable that check.</p>

<p>A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z])
and is terminated with a dash (&quot;-&quot;). Companies and
organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase,
preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a
trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor
prefix is to prevent name conflicts.</p>

<p>--help Show command synopsis.</p>

<p>--manual Show this manualpage.</p>

<p>--version Show the xdg-utils version information.</p>

<p>DESKTOP FILES An application launcher can be added to
the desktop by installing a *.desktop file. A *.desktop file
consists of a [Desktop Entry] header followed by several
Key=Value lines.</p>

<p>A *.desktop file can provide a name and description for
an application in several different languages. This is done
by adding a language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square
brackets behind the Key. This way one can specify different
values for the same Key depending on the currently selected
language.</p>

<p>The following keys are often used:</p>

<p>Value=1.0 This is a mandatory field to indicate that the
*.desktop file follows the 1.0 version of the
specification.</p>

<p>Type=Application This is a mandatory field that
indicates that the *.desktop file describes an application
launcher.</p>

<p>Name=Application Name The name of the application. For
example Mozilla</p>

<p>GenericName=Generic Name A generic description of the
application. For example Web Browser</p>

<p>Comment=Comment Optional field to specify a tooltip for
the application. For example Visit websites on the
Internet</p>

<p>Icon=Icon File The icon to use for the application. This
can either be an absolute path to an image file or an
icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup by
name is done in the users current icon theme. The
xdg-icon-resource command can be used to install image files
into icon themes. The advantage of using an icon-name
instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name the
application icon can be provided in several different sizes
as well as in several differently themed styles.</p>

<p>Exec=Command Line The command line to start the
application. If the application can open files the %f
placeholder should be specified. When a file is dropped on
the application launcher the %f is replaced with the file
path of the dropped file. If multiple files can be specified
on the command line the %F placeholder should be used
instead of %f. If the application is able to open URLs in
addition to local files then %u or %U can be used instead of
%f or %F.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES xdg-desktop-icon honours the
following environment variables:</p>

<p>XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL Setting this environment variable
to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-desktop-icon do more
verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value
increases the verbosity.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES An exit code of 0 indicates success while a
non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure
codes can be returned:</p>

<p>1 Error in command line syntax.</p>

<p>2 One of the files passed on the command line did not
exist.</p>

<p>3 A required tool could not be found.</p>

<p>4 The action failed.</p>

<p>5 No permission to read one of the files passed on the
command line.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The company ShinyThings Inc. has developed an
application named &quot;WebMirror&quot; and would like to
add a launcher for for on the desktop. The company will use
&quot;shinythings&quot; as its vendor id. In order to add
the application to the desktop there needs to be a .desktop
file for the application:</p>

<p>shinythings-webmirror.desktop:</p>

<p>[Desktop Entry] Encoding=UTF-8 Type=Application</p>

<p>Exec=webmirror Icon=shinythings-webmirror</p>

<p>Name=WebMirror Name[nl]=WebSpiegel</p>

<p>Now the xdg-desktop-icon tool can be used to add the
webmirror.desktop file to the desktop:</p>

<p>xdg-desktop-icon install
./shinythings-webmirror.desktop</p>

<p>To add a README file to the desktop as well, the
following command can be used:</p>

<p>xdg-desktop-icon install ./shinythings-README</p>
