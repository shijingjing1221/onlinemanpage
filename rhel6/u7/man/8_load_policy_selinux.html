<p>NAME load_policy_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the load_pol- icy processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
load_policy processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The load_policy processes execute with the load_policy_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep load_policy_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The load_policy_t SELinux type can be
entered via the load_pol- icy_exec_t file type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the load_policy_t
domain are the fol- lowing:</p>

<p>/sbin/load_policy, /usr/sbin/load_policy</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux load_policy policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their load_policy processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
load_policy:</p>

<p>load_policy_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a load_policy_t can be used
to make the pro- cess type load_policy_t permissive. SELinux
does not deny access to permissive process types, but the
AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. load_policy policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run load_policy with the tight- est access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to boolean to determine whether the system
permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing
boolean values. Set this to true and you have to reboot to
set it back, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type load_policy_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>boolean_type</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux load_policy policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their load_policy processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
load_policy:</p>

<p>load_policy_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the load_policy_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the load_policy_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /sbin/load_policy, /usr/sbin/load_policy</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
