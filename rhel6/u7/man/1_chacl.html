<p>CHACL(1) Access Control Lists CHACL(1)</p>

<p>NAME chacl - change the access control list of a file or
directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS chacl acl pathname... chacl -b acl dacl
pathname... chacl -d dacl pathname... chacl -R pathname...
chacl -D pathname... chacl -B pathname... chacl -l
pathname... chacl -r pathname...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION chacl is an IRIX-compatibility command, and
is maintained for those users who are familiar with its use
from either XFS or IRIX. Refer to the SEE ALSO section below
for a description of tools which conform more closely to the
(withdrawn draft) POSIX 1003.1e standard which describes
Access Control Lists (ACLs).</p>

<p>chacl changes the ACL(s) for a file or directory. The
ACL(s) specified are applied to each file in the pathname
arguments.</p>

<p>Each ACL is a string which is interpreted using the
acl_from_text(3) routine. These strings are made up of comma
separated clauses each of which is of the form,
tag:name:perm. Where tag can be:</p>

<p>&quot;user&quot; (or &quot;u&quot;) indicating that the
entry is a user ACL entry.</p>

<p>&quot;group&quot; (or &quot;g&quot;) indicating that the
entry is a group ACL entry.</p>

<p>&quot;other&quot; (or &quot;o&quot;) indicating that the
entry is an other ACL entry.</p>

<p>&quot;mask&quot; (or &quot;m&quot;) indicating that the
entry is a mask ACL entry.</p>

<p>name is a string which is the user or group name for the
ACL entry. A null name in a user or group ACL entry
indicates the files owner or files group. perm is the string
&quot;rwx&quot; where each of the entries may be replaced by
a &quot;-&quot; indicating no access of that type, e.g.
&quot;r-x&quot;, &quot;--x&quot;, &quot;---&quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Indicates that there are two ACLs to change,
the first is the file access ACL and the second the
directory default ACL.</p>

<p>-d Used to set only the default ACL of a directory.</p>

<p>-R Removes the file access ACL only.</p>

<p>-D Removes directory default ACL only.</p>

<p>-B Remove all ACLs.</p>

<p>-l Lists the access ACL and possibly the default ACL
associated with the specified files or directories. This
option was added during the Linux port of XFS, and is not
IRIX compatible.</p>

<p>-r Set the access ACL recursively for each subtree
rooted at path- name(s). This option was also added during
the Linux port of XFS, and is not compatible with IRIX.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES A minimum ACL:</p>

<p>chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r-- file</p>

<p>The file ACL is set so that the files owner has
&quot;rwx&quot;, the files group has read and execute, and
others have read only access to the file.</p>

<p>An ACL that is not a minimum ACL, that is, one that
specifies a user or group other than the files owner or
owner s group, must contain a mask entry:</p>

<p>chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r--,u:bob:r--,m::r-x file1
file2</p>

<p>To set the default and access ACLs on newdir to be the
same as on old- dir, you could type:</p>

<p>chacl -b chacl -l olddir | _ sed -e s/.*[//-e s#/# #-e
s/]$//newdir</p>

<p>CAUTIONS chacl can replace the existing ACL. To add or
delete entries, you must first do chacl -l to get the
existing ACL, and use the output to form the arguments to
chacl.</p>

<p>Changing the permission bits of a file will change the
file access ACL settings (see chmod(1)). However, file
creation mode masks (see umask(1)) will not affect the
access ACL settings of files created using directory default
ACLs.</p>

<p>ACLs are filesystem extended attributes and hence are
not typically archived or restored using the conventional
archiving utilities. See attr(5) for more information about
extended attributes and see xfs- dump(8) for a method of
backing them up under XFS.</p>
