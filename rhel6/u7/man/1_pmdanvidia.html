<p>NAME pmdanvidia - nvidia gpu metrics domain agent
(PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/pmdanvidia [-d domain]
[-l logfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdanvidia is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing
the metrics available on NVIDIA GPU cards via the NVML
library.</p>

<p>The nvidia PMDA exports metrics that measure gpu
activity, memory uti- lization, fan speed, etc on NVIDIA
Tesla and Quadro cards. Metrics are unlikely to be available
for consumer class cards.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdanvidia command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named nvidia.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdanvidia is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION The nvidia PMDA is not installed and
available by default. If you want to undo the installation,
do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia # ./Remove</p>

<p>If you want to establish access to the names, help text
and values for the nvidia performance metrics once more,
after removal, do the follow- ing as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia # ./Install</p>

<p>pmdanvidia is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdanvidia $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/help default help
text file for the nvidia metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/Install installation script for the
pmdanvidia agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdanvidia agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/nvidia.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdanvidia</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
