<p>MC(1) GNU Midnight Commander MC(1)</p>

<p>NAME mc - Visual shell for Unix-like systems.</p>

<p>USAGE mc [-abcCdfhPstuUVx] [-l log] [dir1 [dir2]] [-e
[file]] [-v file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION GNU Midnight Commander is a directory
browser/file manager for Unix-like operating systems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --stickchars Disable usage of graphic
characters for line drawing.</p>

<p>-b, --nocolor Force black and white display.</p>

<p>-c, --color Force color mode, please check the section
Colors for more information.</p>

<p>-C arg, --colors=arg Specify a different color set in
the command line. The format of arg is documented in the
Colors section.</p>

<p>-S arg Specify a name of skin in the command line.
Technology of skins is documented in the Skins. section.</p>

<p>-d, --nomouse Disable mouse support.</p>

<p>-e [file], --edit[=file] Start the internal editor. If
the file is specified, open it on startup. See also mcedit
(1).</p>

<p>-f, --datadir Display the compiled-in search paths for
Midnight Commander files.</p>

<p>-k, --resetsoft Reset softkeys to their default from the
termcap/terminfo database. Only useful on HP terminals when
the function keys dont work.</p>

<p>-K Specify a name of keymap file in the command
line.</p>

<p>-l file, --ftplog=file Save the ftpfs dialog with the
server in file.</p>

<p>-P file, --printwd=file Print the last working directory
to the specified file. This option is not meant to be used
directly. Instead, its used from a special shell script that
automatically changes the cur- rent directory of the shell
to the last directory the Midnight Commander was in. Source
the file /usr/share/mc/bin/mc.sh (bash and zsh users) or
/usr/share/mc/bin/mc.csh (tcsh users) respec- tively to
define mc as an alias to the appropriate shell script.</p>

<p>-s Set alternative mode drawing of frameworks. If the
section [Lines] is not filled, the symbol for the
pseudographics frame is a space, otherwise the frame
characters are taken from follow params.</p>

<p>You can redefine the following variables:</p>

<p>lefttop left-top corner</p>

<p>righttop right-top corner</p>

<p>centertop center-top cross</p>

<p>centerbottom center-bottom cross</p>

<p>leftbottom left-bottom corner</p>

<p>rightbottom right-bottom corner</p>

<p>leftmiddle left-middle cross</p>

<p>rightmiddle right-middle cross</p>

<p>centermiddle center cross</p>

<p>horiz default horizontal line</p>

<p>vert default vertical line</p>

<p>thinhoriz thin horizontal line</p>

<p>thinvert thin vertical line</p>

<p>-t, --termcap Used only if the code was compiled with
Slang and terminfo: it makes the Midnight Commander use the
value of the TERMCAP vari- able for the terminal information
instead of the information on the system wide terminal
database</p>

<p>-u, --nosubshell Disable use of the concurrent shell
(only makes sense if the Midnight Commander has been built
with concurrent shell sup- port).</p>

<p>-U, --subshell Enable use of the concurrent shell
support (only makes sense if the Midnight Commander was
built with the subshell support set as an optional
feature).</p>

<p>-v file, --view=file Start the internal viewer to view
the specified file. See also mcview (1).</p>

<p>-V, --version Display the version of the program.</p>

<p>-x, --xterm Force xterm mode. Used when running on
xterm-capable terminals (two screen modes, and able to send
mouse escape sequences).</p>

<p>If specified, the first path name is the directory to
show in the selected panel; the second path name is the
directory to be shown in the other panel.</p>

<p>Overview The screen of the Midnight Commander is divided
into four parts. Almost all of the screen space is taken up
by two directory panels. By default, the second line from
the bottom of the screen is the shell command line, and the
bottom line shows the function key labels. The topmost line
is the menu bar line. The menu bar line may not be visi-
ble, but appears if you click the topmost line with the
mouse or press the F9 key.</p>

<p>The Midnight Commander provides a view of two
directories at the same time. One of the panels is the
current panel (a selection bar is in the current panel).
Almost all operations take place on the current panel. Some
file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the
directory of the unselected panel as a destination (dont
worry, they always ask you for confirmation first). For more
information, see the sections on the Directory Panels, the
Left and Right Menus and the File Menu.</p>

<p>You can execute system commands from the Midnight
Commander by simply typing them. Everything you type will
appear on the shell command line, and when you press Enter
the Midnight Commander will execute the com- mand line you
typed; read the Shell Command Line and Input Line Keys
sections to learn more about the command line.</p>

<p>Mouse Support The Midnight Commander comes with mouse
support. It is activated when- ever you are running on an
xterm(1) terminal (it even works if you take a telnet, ssh
or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm) or
if you are running on a Linux console and have the gpm mouse
server running.</p>

<p>When you left click on a file in the directory panels,
that file is selected; if you click with the right button,
the file is marked (or unmarked, depending on the previous
state).</p>

<p>Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the
command if it is an executable program; and if the extension
file has a program specified for the file s extension, the
specified program is executed.</p>

<p>Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to
the function key labels by clicking on them.</p>

<p>If a mouse button is clicked on the top frame line of
the directory panel, it is scrolled one page up. Likewise, a
click on the bottom frame line will cause scrolling one page
down. This frame line method works also in the Help Viewer
and the Directory Tree.</p>

<p>The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is
400 milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by
editing the ~/.mc/ini file and changing the
mouse_repeat_rate parameter.</p>

<p>If you are running the Midnight Commander with the mouse
support, you can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and
pasting text) by hold- ing down the Shift key.</p>

<p>Keys Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the
use of the Control (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the
Meta (sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this
manual we will use the following abbrevia- tions:</p>

<p>C-&lt;chr&gt; means hold the Control key while typing
the character &lt;chr&gt;. Thus C-f would be: hold the
Control key and type f.</p>

<p>Alt-&lt;chr&gt; means hold the Meta or Alt key down
while typing &lt;chr&gt;. If there is no Meta or Alt key,
type ESC, release it, then type the character
&lt;chr&gt;.</p>

<p>S-&lt;chr&gt; means hold the Shift key down while typing
&lt;chr&gt;.</p>

<p>All input lines in the Midnight Commander use an
approximation to the GNU Emacs editors key bindings
(default).</p>

<p>You may redefine key bindings. See redefine hotkey
bindings</p>

<p>for more info. All other key bindings (described in this
manual) rela- tive to default behavior.</p>

<p>There are many sections which tell about the keys. The
following are the most important.</p>

<p>The File Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts
for the commands appearing in the File menu. This section
includes the function keys. Most of these commands perform
some action, usually on the selected file or the tagged
files.</p>

<p>The Directory Panels section documents the keys which
select a file or tag files as a target for a later action
(the action is usually one from the file menu).</p>

<p>The Shell Command Line section list the keys which are
used for enter- ing and editing command lines. Most of these
copy file names and such from the directory panels to the
command line (to avoid excessive typ- ing) or access the
command line history.</p>

<p>Input Line Keys are used for editing input lines. This
means both the command line and the input lines in the query
dialogs.</p>

<p>Redefine hotkey bindings Hotkey bindings may be readed
from external file (keymap-file). A keymap-file is searched
on the following algorithm (to the first one found):</p>

<p>1) command line option -K &lt;keymap&gt; or
--keymap=&lt;keymap&gt; 2) Environment variable MC_KEYMAP 3)
In config file parameter keymap in section [MidhightComman-
der] 4) File ~/.mc/mc.keymap 5) File /etc/mc/mc.keymap 6)
File /usr/share/mc/mc.keymap</p>

<p>Command line option, environment variable and parameter
in config file may contain the absolute path to the
keymap-file (with the extension .keymap or without it).
Search of keymap-file will occur in (to the first one
found):</p>

<p>1) ~/.mc/ 2) /etc/mc/ 3) /usr/share/mc/</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Keys Here are some keys which dont fall
into any of the other categories:</p>

<p>Enter if there is some text in the command line (the one
at the bottom of the panels), then that command is executed.
If there is no text in the command line then if the
selection bar is over a directory the Midnight Commander
does a chdir(2) to the selected directory and reloads the
information on the panel; if the selection is an executable
file then it is executed. Finally, if the extension of the
selected file name matches one of the extensions in the
extensions file then the corresponding command is
executed.</p>

<p>C-l repaint all the information in the Midnight
Commander.</p>

<p>C-x c run the Chmod command on a file or on the tagged
files.</p>

<p>C-x o run the Chown command on the current file or on
the tagged files.</p>

<p>C-x l run the link command.</p>

<p>C-x s run the symbolic link command.</p>

<p>C-x i set the other panel display mode to
information.</p>

<p>C-x q set the other panel display mode to quick
view.</p>

<p>C-x ! execute the External panelize command.</p>

<p>C-x h run the add directory to hotlist command.</p>

<p>Alt-! executes the Filtered view command, described in
the view com- mand.</p>

<p>Alt-? executes the Find file command.</p>

<p>Alt-c pops up the quick cd dialog.</p>

<p>C-o when the program is being run in the Linux or
FreeBSD console or under an xterm, it will show you the
output of the previous com- mand. When ran on the Linux
console, the Midnight Commander uses an external program
(cons.saver) to handle saving and restoring of information
on the screen.</p>

<p>When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type
C-o at any time and you will be taken back to the Midnight
Commander main screen, to return to your application just
type C-o. If you have an application suspended by using this
trick, you won t be able to execute other pro- grams from
the Midnight Commander until you terminate the suspended
application.</p>

<p>Directory Panels This section lists the keys which
operate on the directory panels. If you want to know how to
change the appearance of the panels take a look at the
section on Left and Right Menus.</p>

<p>Tab, C-i change the current panel. The old other panel
becomes the new current panel and the old current panel
becomes the new other panel. The selection bar moves from
the old current panel to the new current panel.</p>

<p>Insert, C-t to tag files you may use the Insert key (the
kich1 terminfo sequence). To untag files, just retag a
tagged file.</p>

<p>M-e to change charset of panel you may use M-e (Alt-e).
Recoding is made from selected codepage into system
codepage. To cancel the recoding you may select
&quot;directory up&quot; (..) in active panel. To cancel the
charsets in all directories, select &quot;No translation
&quot; in the dialog of encodings.</p>

<p>Alt-g, Alt-r, Alt-j used to select the top file in a
panel, the middle file and the bottom one, respectively.</p>

<p>C-s, Alt-s start a filename search in the directory
listing. When the search is active, the user input will be
added to the search string instead of the command line. If
the Show mini-status option is enabled the search string is
shown on the mini-status line. When typing, the selection
bar will move to the next file starting with the typed
letters. The backspace or DEL keys can be used to correct
typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed again, the next match is
searched for.</p>

<p>Alt-t toggle the current display listing to show the
next display listing mode. With this it is possible to
quickly switch to brief listing, long listing, user defined
listing mode, and back to the default.</p>

<p>C-(control-backslash) show the directory hotlist and
change to the selected directory.</p>

<p>+ (plus) this is used to select (tag) a group of files.
The Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options.
When Files only checkbox is on, only files will be selected.
If Files only is off, as files as directories will be
selected. When Shell Pat- terns checkbox is on, the regular
expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell
(* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for
one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging
of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed
(1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will
be case sensitive characters. If Case sensi- tive is off,
the case will be ignored.</p>

<p>(backslash) use the &quot; site of the Plus key.</p>

<p>up-key, C-p move the selection bar to the previous entry
in the panel.</p>

<p>down-key, C-n move the selection bar to the next entry
in the panel.</p>

<p>home, a1, Alt-&lt; move the selection bar to the first
entry in the panel.</p>

<p>end, c1, Alt-&gt; move the selection bar to the last
entry in the panel.</p>

<p>next-page, C-v move the selection bar one page down.</p>

<p>prev-page, Alt-v move the selection bar one page up.</p>

<p>Alt-o If the currently selected file is a directory,
load that direc- tory on the other panel and moves the
selection to the next file. If the currently selected file
is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other
panel and moves the selection to the next file.</p>

<p>Alt-i make the current directory of the current panel
also the current directory of the other panel. Put the other
panel to the list- ing mode if needed. If the current panel
is panelized, the other panel doesnt become panelized.</p>

<p>C-PageUp, C-PageDown only when supported by the
terminal: change to &quot;..&quot; and to the currently
selected directory respectively.</p>

<p>Alt-y moves to the previous directory in the history,
equivalent to clicking the &lt; with the mouse.</p>

<p>Alt-u moves to the next directory in the history,
equivalent to click- ing the &gt; with the mouse.</p>

<p>Alt-Shift-h, Alt-H displays the directory history,
equivalent to depressing the v with the mouse.</p>

<p>Shell Command Line This section lists keys which are
useful to avoid excessive typing when entering shell
commands.</p>

<p>Alt-Enter copy the currently selected file name to the
command line.</p>

<p>C-Enter same a Alt-Enter. May not work on remote systems
and some ter- minals.</p>

<p>C-Shift-Enter copy the full path name of the currently
selected file to the command line. May not work on remote
systems and some termi- nals.</p>

<p>Alt-Tab does the filename, command, variable, username
and hostname com- pletion for you.</p>

<p>C-x t, C-x C-t copy the tagged files (or if there are no
tagged files, the selected file) of the current panel (C-x
t) or of the other panel (C-x C-t) to the command line.</p>

<p>C-x p, C-x C-p the first key sequence copies the current
path name to the com- mand line, and the second one copies
the unselected panels path name to the command line.</p>

<p>C-q the quote command can be used to insert characters
that are oth- erwise interpreted by the Midnight Commander
(like the + sym- bol)</p>

<p>Alt-p, Alt-n use these keys to browse through the
command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n
takes you to the next one.</p>

<p>Alt-h displays the history for the current input
line.</p>

<p>General Movement Keys The help viewer, the file viewer
and the directory tree use common code to handle moving.
Therefore they accept exactly the same keys. Each of them
also accepts some keys of its own.</p>

<p>Other parts of the Midnight Commander use some of the
same movement keys, so this section may be of use for those
parts too.</p>

<p>Up, C-p moves one line backward.</p>

<p>Down, C-n moves one line forward.</p>

<p>Prev Page, Page Up, Alt-v moves one page up.</p>

<p>Next Page, Page Down, C-v moves one page down.</p>

<p>Home, A1 moves to the beginning.</p>

<p>End, C1 move to the end.</p>

<p>The help viewer and the file viewer accept the following
keys in addi- tion the to ones mentioned above:</p>

<p>b, C-b, C-h, Backspace, Delete moves one page up.</p>

<p>Space bar moves one page down.</p>

<p>u, d moves one half of a page up or down.</p>

<p>g, G moves to the beginning or to the end.</p>

<p>Input Line Keys The input lines (they are used for the
command line and for the query dialogs in the program)
accept these keys:</p>

<p>C-a puts the cursor at the beginning of line.</p>

<p>C-e puts the cursor at the end of the line.</p>

<p>C-b, move-left move the cursor one position left.</p>

<p>C-f, move-right move the cursor one position right.</p>

<p>Alt-f moves one word forward.</p>

<p>Alt-b moves one word backward.</p>

<p>C-h, backspace delete the previous character.</p>

<p>C-d, Delete delete the character in the point (over the
cursor).</p>

<p>C-@ sets the mark for cutting.</p>

<p>C-w copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a
kill buffer and removes the text from the input line.</p>

<p>Alt-w copies the text between the cursor and the mark to
a kill buffer.</p>

<p>C-y yanks back the contents of the kill buffer.</p>

<p>C-k kills the text from the cursor to the end of the
line.</p>

<p>Alt-p, Alt-n Use these keys to browse through the
command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n
takes you to the next one.</p>

<p>Alt-C-h, Alt-Backspace delete one word backward.</p>

<p>Alt-Tab does the filename, command, variable, username
and hostname com- pletion for you.</p>

<p>Menu Bar The menu bar pops up when you press F9 or click
the mouse on the top row of the screen. The menu bar has
five menus: &quot;Left&quot;, &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Com-
mand&quot;, &quot;Options&quot; and &quot;Right&quot;.</p>

<p>The Left and Right Menus allow you to modify the
appearance of the left and right directory panels.</p>

<p>The File Menu lists the actions you can perform on the
currently selected file or the tagged files.</p>

<p>The Command Menu lists the actions which are more
general and bear no relation to the currently selected file
or the tagged files.</p>

<p>The Options Menu lists the actions which allow you to
customize the Midnight Commander.</p>

<p>Left and Right (Above and Below) Menus The outlook of
the directory panels can be changed from the Left and Right
menus (they are named Above and Below when the horizontal
panel split is chosen from the Layout options dialog).</p>

<p>Listing Mode... The listing mode view is used to display
a listing of files, there are four different listing modes
available: Full, Brief, Long and User. The full directory
view shows the file name, the size of the file and the
modification time.</p>

<p>The brief view shows only the file name and it has two
columns (there- fore showing twice as many files as other
views). The long view is sim- ilar to the output of ls -l
command. The long view takes the whole screen width.</p>

<p>If you choose the &quot;User&quot; display format, then
you have to specify the display format.</p>

<p>The user display format must start with a panel size
specifier. This may be &quot;half&quot; or &quot;full&quot;,
and they specify a half screen panel and a full screen panel
respectively.</p>

<p>After the panel size, you may specify the two columns
mode on the panel, this is done by adding the number
&quot;2&quot; to the user format string.</p>

<p>After this you add the name of the fields with an
optional size speci- fier. This are the available fields you
may display:</p>

<p>name displays the file name.</p>

<p>size displays the file size.</p>

<p>bsize is an alternative form of the size format. It
displays the size of the files and for directories it just
shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.</p>

<p>type displays a one character wide type field. This
character is similar to what is displayed by ls with the -F
flag - * for exe- cutable files, / for directories, @ for
links, = for sockets, - for character devices, + for block
devices, | for pipes, ~ for symbolic links to directories
and ! for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).</p>

<p>mark an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it s
not.</p>

<p>mtime files last modification time.</p>

<p>atime files last access time.</p>

<p>ctime files status change time.</p>

<p>perm a string representing the current permission bits
of the file.</p>

<p>mode an octal value with the current permission bits of
the file.</p>

<p>nlink the number of links to the file.</p>

<p>ngid the GID (numeric).</p>

<p>nuid the UID (numeric).</p>

<p>owner the owner of the file.</p>

<p>group the group of the file.</p>

<p>inode the inode of the file.</p>

<p>Also you can use following keywords to define the panel
layout:</p>

<p>space a space in the display format.</p>

<p>| add a vertical line to the display format.</p>

<p>To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier),
you just add : followed by the number of characters you want
the field to have. If the number is followed by the symbol
+, then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the
program finds out that there is more space on the screen, it
will then expand that field.</p>

<p>For example, the Full display corresponds to this
format:</p>

<p>half type name | size | mtime</p>

<p>And the Long display corresponds to this format:</p>

<p>full perm space nlink space owner space group space size
space mtime space name</p>

<p>This is a nice user display format:</p>

<p>half name | size:7 | type mode:3</p>

<p>Panels may also be set to the following modes:</p>

<p>Info The info view display information related to the
currently selected file and if possible information about
the current file system.</p>

<p>Tree The tree view is quite similar to the directory
tree feature. See the section about it for more
information.</p>

<p>Quick View In this mode, the panel will switch to a
reduced viewer that displays the contents of the currently
selected file, if you select the panel (with the tab key or
the mouse), you will have access to the usual viewer
commands.</p>

<p>Sort Order... The eight sort orders are by name, by
extension, by modification time, by access time, and by
inode information modification time, by size, by inode and
unsorted. In the Sort order dialog box you can choose the
sort order and you may also specify if you want to sort in
reverse order by checking the reverse box.</p>

<p>By default directories are sorted before files but this
can be changed from the Options menu (option Mix all
files).</p>

<p>Filter... The filter command allows you to specify a
shell pattern (for example *.tar.gz) which the files must
match to be shown. Regardless of the filter pattern, the
directories and the links to directories are always shown in
the directory panel.</p>

<p>Reread The reread command reload the list of files in
the directory. It is useful if other processes have created
or removed files. If you have panelized file names in a
panel this will reload the directory contents and remove the
panelized information (See the section External panelize for
more information).</p>

<p>File Menu The Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys
as keyboard shortcuts for commands appearing in the file
menu. The escape sequences for the function keys are
terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10. On terminals without
function key support, you can achieve the same functionality
by pressing the ESC key and then a number in the range 1
through 9 and 0 (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10
respectively).</p>

<p>The File menu has the following commands (keyboard
shortcuts in paren- theses):</p>

<p>Help (F1)</p>

<p>Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the
help viewer, you can use the Tab key to select the next link
and the Enter key to follow that link. The keys Space and
Backspace are used to move forward and backward in a help
page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted
keys.</p>

<p>Menu (F2)</p>

<p>Invoke the user menu. The user menu provides an easy way
to provide users with a menu and add extra features to the
Midnight Commander.</p>

<p>View (F3, Shift-F3)</p>

<p>View the currently selected file. By default this
invokes the Internal File Viewer but if the option &quot;Use
internal view&quot; is off, it invokes an external file
viewer specified by the VIEWER environment variable. If
VIEWER is undefined, the PAGER environment variable is
tried. If PAGER is also undefined, the &quot;view&quot;
command is invoked. If you use Shift-F3 instead, the viewer
will be invoked without doing any formatting or
preprocessing to the file.</p>

<p>Filtered View (Alt-!)</p>

<p>This command prompts for a command and its arguments
(the argument defaults to the currently selected file name),
the output from such command is shown in the internal file
viewer.</p>

<p>Edit (F4, F14)</p>

<p>Press F4 to edit the highlighted file. Press F14
(usually Shift-F4) to start the editor with a new, empty
file. Currently they invoke the vi editor, or the editor
specified in the EDITOR environment variable, or the
Internal File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is
on.</p>

<p>Copy (F5, F15)</p>

<p>Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently
selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one
file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the
input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in
the non-selected panel. During this pro- cess, you can press
C-c or ESC to abort the operation. For details about source
mask (which will be usually either * or ^$ depending on
setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the
desti- nation see Mask copy/rename.</p>

<p>F15 (usually Shift-F5) is similar, but defaults to the
directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the
selected file, regardless of any tagged files.</p>

<p>On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the
background by clicking on the background button (or pressing
Alt-b in the dialog box). The Background Jobs is used to
control the background process.</p>

<p>Link (C-x l)</p>

<p>Create a hard link to the current file.</p>

<p>SymLink (C-x s)</p>

<p>Create a symbolic link to the current file. To those of
you who dont know what links are: creating a link to a file
is a bit like copying the file, but both the source filename
and the destination filename represent the same file image.
For example, if you edit one of these files, all changes you
make will appear in both files. Some people call links
aliases or shortcuts.</p>

<p>A hard link appears as a real file. After making it,
there is no way of telling which one is the original and
which is the link. If you delete either one of them the
other one is still intact. It is very difficult to notice
that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when
you dont even want to know.</p>

<p>A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the
original file. If the original file is deleted the symbolic
link is useless. It is quite easy to notice that the files
represent the same image. The Midnight Comman- der shows an
&quot;@&quot;-sign in front of the file name if it is a
symbolic link to somewhere (except to directory, where it
shows a tilde (~)). The original file which the link points
to is shown on mini-status line if the Show mini-status
option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid
the confusion that can be caused by hard links.</p>

<p>Rename/Move (F6, F16)</p>

<p>Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently
selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one
file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the
input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in
the non-selected panel. For more details look at Copy (F5)
operation above, most of the things are quite simi- lar.</p>

<p>F16 (usually Shift-F6) is similar, but defaults to the
directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the
selected file, regardless of any tagged files.</p>

<p>On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the
background by clicking on the background button (or pressing
Alt-b in the dialog box). The Background Jobs is used to
control the background process.</p>

<p>Mkdir (F7)</p>

<p>Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory
specified.</p>

<p>Delete (F8)</p>

<p>Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files
in the currently selected panel. During the process, you can
press C-c or ESC to abort the operation.</p>

<p>Quick cd (Alt-c) Use the quick cd command if you have
full command line and want to cd somewhere.</p>

<p>Select group (+)</p>

<p>This is used to select (tag) a group of files. The
Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When
Files only checkbox is on, only files will be selected. If
Files only is off, as files as direc- tories will be
selected. When Shell Patterns checkbox is on, the regu- lar
expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell
(* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for
one charac- ter). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging
of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed
(1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will
be case sensitive characters. If Case sensi- tive is off,
the case will be ignored.</p>

<p>Unselect group )</p>

<p>Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite
of the Select group command.</p>

<p>Quit (F10, Shift-F10)</p>

<p>Terminate the Midnight Commander. Shift-F10 is used when
you want to quit and you are using the shell wrapper.
Shift-F10 will not take you to the last directory you
visited with the Midnight Commander, instead it will stay at
the directory where you started the Midnight Commander.</p>

<p>Quick cd This command is useful if you have a full
command line and want to cd somewhere without having to yank
and paste the command line. This com- mand pops up a small
dialog, where you enter everything you would enter after cd
on the command line and then you press enter. This features
all the things that are already in the internal cd
command.</p>

<p>Command Menu The Directory tree command shows a tree
figure of the directories.</p>

<p>The Find file command allows you to search for a
specific file.</p>

<p>The &quot;Swap panels&quot; command swaps the contents
of the two directory pan- els.</p>

<p>The &quot;Panels on/off&quot; command shows the output
of the last shell command. This works only on xterm and on
Linux and FreeBSD console.</p>

<p>The Compare directories (C-x d) command compares the
directory panels with each other. You can then use the Copy
(F5) command to make the panels identical. There are three
compare methods. The quick method compares only file size
and file date. The thorough method makes a full byte-by-byte
compare. The thorough method is not available if the machine
does not support the mmap(2) system call. The size-only com-
pare method just compares the file sizes and does not check
the con- tents or the date times, it just checks the file
size.</p>

<p>The Command history command shows a list of typed
commands. The selected command is copied to the command
line. The command history can also be accessed by typing
Alt-p or Alt-n.</p>

<p>The Directory hotlist (C- command makes changing of the
current directory to often used directories faster.</p>

<p>The External panelize allows you to execute an external
program, and make the output of that program the contents of
the current panel.</p>

<p>Extension file edit command allows you to specify
programs to executed when you try to execute, view, edit and
do a bunch of other thing on files with certain extensions
(filename endings). The Menu file edit command may be used
for editing the user menu (which appears by press- ing
F2).</p>

<p>Directory Tree The Directory Tree command shows a tree
figure of the directories. You can select a directory from
the figure and the Midnight Commander will change to that
directory.</p>

<p>There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real
directory tree command is available from Commands menu. The
other way is to select tree view from the Left or Right
menu.</p>

<p>To get rid of long delays the Midnight Commander creates
the tree fig- ure by scanning only a small subset of all the
directories. If the directory which you want to see is
missing, move to its parent direc- tory and press C-r (or
F2).</p>

<p>You can use the following keys:</p>

<p>General movement keys are accepted.</p>

<p>Enter. In the directory tree, exits the directory tree
and changes to this directory in the current panel. In the
tree view, changes to this directory in the other panel and
stays in tree view mode in the current panel.</p>

<p>C-r, F2 (Rescan). Rescan this directory. Use this when
the tree figure is out of date: it is missing subdirectories
or shows some subdirecto- ries which dont exist any
more.</p>

<p>F3 (Forget). Delete this directory from the tree figure.
Use this to remove clutter from the figure. If you want the
directory back to the tree figure press F2 in its parent
directory.</p>

<p>F4 (Static/Dynamic). Toggle between the dynamic
navigation mode (default) and the static navigation
mode.</p>

<p>In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and
Down keys to select a directory. All known directories are
shown.</p>

<p>In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and
Down keys to select a sibling directory, the Left key to
move to the parent direc- tory, and the Right key to move to
a child directory. Only the parent, sibling and children
directories are shown, others are left out. The tree figure
changes dynamically as you traverse.</p>

<p>F5 (Copy). Copy the directory.</p>

<p>F6 (RenMov). Move the directory.</p>

<p>F7 (Mkdir). Make a new directory below this
directory.</p>

<p>F8 (Delete). Delete this directory from the file
system.</p>

<p>C-s, Alt-s. Search the next directory matching the
search string. If there is no such directory these keys will
move one line down.</p>

<p>C-h, Backspace. Delete the last character of the search
string.</p>

<p>Any other character. Add the character to the search
string and move to the next directory which starts with
these characters. In the tree view you must first activate
the search mode by pressing C-s. The search string is shown
in the mini status line.</p>

<p>The following actions are available only in the
directory tree. They arent supported in the tree view.</p>

<p>F1 (Help). Invoke the help viewer and show this
section.</p>

<p>Esc, F10. Exit the directory tree. Do not change the
directory.</p>

<p>The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like
Enter. See also the section on mouse support.</p>

<p>Find File The Find File feature first asks for the start
directory for the search and the filename to be searched
for. By pressing the Tree button you can select the start
directory from the directory tree figure.</p>

<p>The contents field accepts regular expressions similar
to egrep(1). That means you have to escape characters with a
special meaning to egrep with &quot; input &quot;strcmp
(without the double quotes).</p>

<p>Option form whole words. Like grep -w</p>

<p>You can start the search by pressing the OK button.
During the search you can stop from the Stop button and
continue from the Start button.</p>

<p>You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow
keys. The Chdir button will change to the directory of the
currently selected file. The Again button will ask for the
parameters for a new search. The Quit button quits the
search operation. The Panelize button will place the found
files to the current directory panel so that you can do
addi- tional operations on them (view, copy, move, delete
and so on). After panelizing you can press C-r to return to
the normal file listing.</p>

<p>It is possible to have a list of directories that the
Find File command should skip during the search (for
example, you may want to avoid searches on a CD-ROM or on a
NFS directory that is mounted across a slow link).</p>

<p>Directories to be skipped should be set on the variable
find_ignore_dirs in the Misc section of your ~/.mc/ini
file.</p>

<p>Directory components should be separated with a colon,
here is an exam- ple:</p>

<p>[Misc] find_ignore_dirs=/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs</p>

<p>You may consider using the External panelize command for
some opera- tions. Find file command is for simple queries
only, while using Exter- nal panelize you can do as
mysterious searches as you would like.</p>

<p>External panelize The External panelize allows you to
execute an external program, and make the output of that
program the contents of the current panel.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to manipulate in one of the
panels all the symbolic links in the current directory, you
can use external paneliza- tion to run the following
command:</p>

<p>find . -type l -print</p>

<p>Upon command completion, the directory contents of the
panel will no longer be the directory listing of the current
directory, but all the files that are symbolic links.</p>

<p>If you want to panelize all of the files that have been
downloaded from your FTP server, you can use this awk
command to extract the file name from the transfer log
files:</p>

<p>awk $9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 } &lt;
/var/log/xferlog</p>

<p>You may want to save often used panelize commands under
a descriptive name, so that you can recall them quickly. You
do this by typing the command on the input line and pressing
Add new button. Then you enter a name under which you want
the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that
command from the list and do not have to type it again.</p>

<p>Hotlist The Directory hotlist command shows the labels
of the directories in the directory hotlist. The Midnight
Commander will change to the directory corresponding to the
selected label. From the hotlist dia- log, you can remove
already created label/directory pairs and add new ones. To
add new directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist
command (C-x h), which adds the current directory into the
directory hotlist, asking just for the label for the
directory.</p>

<p>This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may
consider using the CDPATH variable as described in internal
cd command description.</p>

<p>Extension File Edit This will invoke your editor on the
file ~/.mc/bindings. The format of this file following:</p>

<p>All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown
away.</p>

<p>Lines starting in the first column should have following
format:</p>

<p>keyword/expr, i.e. everything after the slash until new
line is expr.</p>

<p>keyword can be:</p>

<p>shell - expr is an extension (no wildcards). File
matches it its name ends with expr. Example: shell/.tar
matches *.tar.</p>

<p>regex - expr is a regular expression. File matches if
its name matches the regular expression.</p>

<p>directory - expr is a regular expression. File matches
if it is a direc- tory and its name matches the regular
expression.</p>

<p>type - expr is a regular expression. File matches if the
output of file %f without the initial &quot;filename:&quot;
part matches regular expression expr.</p>

<p>default - matches any file. expr is ignored.</p>

<p>include - denotes a common section. expr is the name of
the section.</p>

<p>Other lines should start with a space or tab and should
be of the for- mat: keyword=command (with no spaces around
=), where keyword should be: Open (invoked on Enter or
double click), View (F3), Edit (F4) or Include (to add rules
from the common section). command is any one-line shell
command, with the simple macro substitution.</p>

<p>Rules are matched from top to bottom, thus the order is
important. If the appropriate action is missing, search
continues as if this rule didn t match (i.e. if a file
matches the first and second entry and View action is
missing in the first one, then on pressing F3 the View
action from the second entry will be used). default should
match all the actions.</p>

<p>Background Jobs This lets you control the state of any
background Midnight Commander process (only copy and move
files operations can be done in the back- ground). You can
stop, restart and kill a background job from here.</p>

<p>Menu File Edit The user menu is a menu of useful actions
that can be customized by the user. When you access the user
menu, the file .mc.menu from the current directory is used
if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root and is
not world-writable. If no such file found, ~/.mc/menu is
tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default
system-wide menu /usr/share/mc/mc.menu.</p>

<p>The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that
start with any- thing but space or tab are considered
entries for the menu (in order to be able to use it like a
hot key, the first character should be a let- ter). All the
lines that start with a space or a tab are the commands that
will be executed when the entry is selected.</p>

<p>When an option is selected all the command lines of the
option are copied to a temporary file in the temporary
directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then that file is executed.
This allows the user to put normal shell constructs in the
menus. Also simple macro substitution takes place before
executing the menu code. For more information, see macro
substitution.</p>

<p>Here is a sample mc.menu file:</p>

<p>A Dump the currently selected file od -c %f</p>

<p>B Edit a bug report and send it to root I=mktemp
${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX || exit 1 vi $I mail -s
&quot;Midnight Commander bug&quot; root &lt; $I rm -f $I</p>

<p>M Read mail emacs -f rmail</p>

<p>N Read Usenet news emacs -f gnus</p>

<p>H Call the info hypertext browser info</p>

<p>J Copy current directory to other panel recursively tar
cf - . | (cd %D &amp;&amp; tar xvpf -)</p>

<p>K Make a release of the current subdirectory echo -n
&quot;Name of distribution file: &quot; read tar ln -s %d
dirname %d/$tar cd .. tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar</p>

<p>= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n X Extract the contents
of a compressed tar file tar xzvf %f</p>

<p>Default Conditions</p>

<p>Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The
condition must start from the first column with a =
character. If the condition is true, the menu entry will be
the default entry.</p>

<p>Condition syntax: = &lt;sub-cond&gt; or: =
&lt;sub-cond&gt; | &lt;sub-cond&gt; ... or: =
&lt;sub-cond&gt; &amp; &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...</p>

<p>Sub-condition is one of following:</p>

<p>y &lt;pattern&gt; syntax of current file matching
pattern? (for edit menu only) f &lt;pattern&gt; current file
matching pattern? F &lt;pattern&gt; other file matching
pattern? d &lt;pattern&gt; current directory matching
pattern? D &lt;pattern&gt; other directory matching pattern?
t &lt;type&gt; current file of type? T &lt;type&gt; other
file of type? x &lt;filename&gt; is it executable filename?
! &lt;sub-cond&gt; negate the result of sub-condition</p>

<p>Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular
expression, according to the shell patterns option. You can
override the global value of the shell patterns option by
writing &quot;shell_patterns=x&quot; on the first line of
the menu file (where &quot;x&quot; is either 0 or 1).</p>

<p>Type is one or more of the following characters:</p>

<p>n not a directory r regular file d directory l link c
character device b block device f FIFO (pipe) s socket x
executable file t tagged</p>

<p>For example rlf means either regular file, link or fifo.
The t type is a little special because it acts on the panel
instead of the file. The condition =t t is true if there are
tagged files in the current panel and false if not.</p>

<p>If the condition starts with =? instead of = a debug
trace will be shown whenever the value of the condition is
calculated.</p>

<p>The conditions are calculated from left to right. This
means = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n is calculated as ( (f
*.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) &amp; (t n)</p>

<p>Here is a sample of the use of conditions:</p>

<p>= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n L List the contents of
a compressed tar-archive gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -</p>

<p>Addition Conditions</p>

<p>If the condition begins with + (or +?) instead of = (or
=?) it is an addition condition. If the condition is true
the menu entry will be included in the menu. If the
condition is false the menu entry will not be included in
the menu.</p>

<p>You can combine default and addition conditions by
starting condition with += or =+ (or +=? or =+? if you want
debug trace). If you want to use two different conditions,
one for adding and another for defaulting, you can precede a
menu entry with two condition lines, one starting with + and
another starting with =.</p>

<p>Comments are started with #. The additional comment
lines must start with #, space or tab.</p>

<p>Options Menu The Midnight Commander has some options
that may be toggled on and off in several dialogs which are
accessible from this menu. Options are enabled if they have
an asterisk or &quot;x&quot; in front of them.</p>

<p>The Configuration command pops up a dialog from which
you can change most of settings of the Midnight
Commander.</p>

<p>The Layout command pops up a dialog from which you
specify a bunch of options how mc looks like on the
screen.</p>

<p>The Confirmation command pops up a dialog from which you
specify which actions you want to confirm.</p>

<p>The Display bits command pops up a dialog from which you
may select which characters is your terminal able to
display.</p>

<p>The Learn keys command pops up a dialog from which you
test some keys which are not working on some terminals and
you may fix them.</p>

<p>The Virtual FS command pops up a dialog from which you
specify some VFS related options.</p>

<p>The Save setup command saves the current settings of the
Left, Right and Options menus. A small number of other
settings is saved, too.</p>

<p>Configuration The options in this dialog are divided
into three groups: Panel Options, Pause after run and Other
Options.</p>

<p>Panel Options</p>

<p>Use SI size units. If this option is set, Midnight
Commander will use SI units (powers of 1000) when displaying
any byte sizes. The suffixes (k, m ...) are shown in
lowercase. If unset (default), Midnight Com- mander will use
binary units (powers of 1024) and the suffixes are shown in
upper case (K, M ...)</p>

<p>Show Backup Files. If enabled, the Midnight Commander
will show files ending with a tilde. Otherwise, they won t
be shown (like GNUs ls option -B).</p>

<p>Show Hidden Files. If enabled, the Midnight Commander
will show all files that start with a dot (like ls -a).</p>

<p>Mark moves down. If enabled, the selection bar will move
down when you mark a file (with Insert key).</p>

<p>Drop down menus. When this option is enabled, the pull
down menus will be activated as soon as you press the F9
key. Otherwise, you will only get the menu title, and you
will have to activate the menu either with the arrow keys or
with the hotkeys. It is recommended if you are using
hotkeys.</p>

<p>Mix all files. If this option is enabled, all files and
directories are shown mixed together. If the option is off,
directories (and links to directories) are shown at the
beginning of the listing, and other files below.</p>

<p>Fast directory reload. If this option is enabled, the
Midnight Comman- der will use a trick to determine if the
directory contents have changed. The trick is to reload the
directory only if the i-node of the directory has changed;
this means that reloads only happen when files are created
or deleted. If what changes is the i-node for a file in the
directory (file size changes, mode or owner changes, etc)
the display is not updated. In these cases, if you have the
option on, you have to rescan the directory manually (with
C-r).</p>

<p>Pause after run</p>

<p>After executing your commands, the Midnight Commander
can pause, so that you can examine the output of the
command. There are three possi- ble settings for this
variable:</p>

<p>Never. Means that you do not want to see the output of
your command. If you are using the Linux or FreeBSD console
or an xterm, you will be able to see the output of the
command by typing C-o.</p>

<p>On dumb terminals. You will get the pause message on
terminals that are not capable of showing the output of the
last command executed (any terminal that is not an xterm or
the Linux console).</p>

<p>Always. The program will pause after executing all of
your commands.</p>

<p>Other Options</p>

<p>Verbose operation. This toggles whether the file Copy,
Rename and Delete operations are verbose (i.e., display a
dialog box for each operation). If you have a slow terminal,
you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is
automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is
less than 9600 bps.</p>

<p>Compute totals. If this option is enabled, the Midnight
Commander com- putes total byte sizes and total number of
files prior to any Copy, Rename and Delete operations. This
will provide you with a more accu- rate progress bar at the
expense of some speed. This option has no effect, if Verbose
operation is disabled.</p>

<p>Shell Patterns. By default the Select, Unselect and
Filter commands will use shell-like regular expressions. The
following conversions are performed to achieve this: the *
is replaced by .* (zero or more characters); the ? is
replaced by . (exactly one character) and . by the literal
dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions
are the ones described in ed(1).</p>

<p>Auto Save Setup. If this option is enabled, when you
exit the Midnight Commander the configurable options of the
Midnight Commander are saved in the ~/.mc/ini file.</p>

<p>Auto menus. If this option is enabled, the user menu
will be invoked at startup. Useful for building menus for
non-unixers.</p>

<p>Use internal editor. If this option is enabled, the
built-in file edi- tor is used to edit files. If the option
is disabled, the editor speci- fied in the EDITOR
environment variable is used. If no editor is spec- ified,
vi is used. See the section on the internal file editor.</p>

<p>Use internal viewer. If this option is enabled, the
built-in file viewer is used to view files. If the option is
disabled, the pager specified in the PAGER environment
variable is used. If no pager is specified, the view command
is used. See the section on the internal file viewer.</p>

<p>Complete: show all. By default the Midnight Commander
pops up all pos- sible completions if the completion is
ambiguous only when you press Alt-Tab for the second time.
For the first time, it just completes as much as possible
and beeps in the case of ambiguity. Enable this option if
you want to see all possible completions even after pressing
Alt-Tab the first time.</p>

<p>Rotating dash. If this option is enabled, the Midnight
Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper right corner as
a work in progress indica- tor.</p>

<p>Lynx-like motion. If this option is enabled, you may use
the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the current
selection is a subdirectory and the shell command line is
empty. By default, this setting is off.</p>

<p>Cd follows links. This option, if set, causes the
Midnight Commander to follow the logical chain of
directories when changing current direc- tory either in the
panels, or using the cd command. This is the default
behavior of bash. When unset, the Midnight Commander follows
the real directory structure, so cd .. if you ve entered
that directory through a link will move you to the current
directorys real parent and not to the directory where the
link was present.</p>

<p>Safe delete. If this option is enabled, deleting files
and directory hotlist entries unintentionally becomes more
difficult. The default selection in the confirmation dialogs
for deletion changes from &quot;Yes&quot; to &quot;No&quot;.
This option is disabled by default.</p>

<p>Layout The layout dialog gives you a possibility to
change the general layout of screen. You can specify whether
the menubar, the command prompt, the hintbar and the
function keybar are visible. On the Linux or FreeBSD console
you can specify how many lines are shown in the output
window.</p>

<p>The rest of the screen area is used for the two
directory panels. You can specify whether the area is split
to the panels in vertical or hor- izontal direction. The
split can be equal or you can specify an unequal split.</p>

<p>You can specify whether permissions and file types
should be high- lighted with distinctive Colors. If the
permission highlighting is enabled, the parts of the perm
and mode display fields which apply to the user running
Midnight Commander are highlighted with the color defined by
the selected keyword. If the file type highlighting is
enabled, file names are colored according to rules described
in /etc/mc/filehighlight.ini file. See Filenames Highlight
for more info.</p>

<p>If the Show Mini-Status option is enabled, one line of
status informa- tion about the currently selected item is
shown at the bottom of the panels.</p>

<p>When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight
Commander sets the terminal window title to the current
working directory and updates it when necessary. If your
terminal emulator is broken and you see some incorrect
output on startup and directory change, turn off the Xterm
Window Title option.</p>

<p>Confirmation In this menu you configure the confirmation
options for file deletion, directory hotlist entries
deletion, overwriting, execution by pressing enter and
quitting the program.</p>

<p>Display bits This is used to configure the range of
visible characters on the screen. This setting may be 7-bits
if your terminal/curses supports only seven output bits,
ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the ISO-8859-1 map
and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display full
8 bit characters.</p>

<p>Learn keys This dialog allows you to test and redefine
functional keys, cursor arrows and some other keys to make
them work properly on your terminal. They often don t, since
many terminal databases are incomplete or bro- ken.</p>

<p>You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi
moving keys (h left, j down, k up and l right). Once you
press any cursor movement key and it is recognized, you can
use that key as well.</p>

<p>You can test keys just by pressing each of them. When
you press a key and it is recognized properly, OK should
appear next to the name of that key. Once a key is marked OK
it starts working as usually, e.g. F1 pressed the first time
will just check that the F1 key works, but after that it
will show help. The same applies to the arrow keys. The Tab
key should be working always.</p>

<p>If some keys do not work properly then you won t see OK
appear after pressing one of these. Then you may want to
redefine it. Do it by pressing the button with the name of
that key (either by the mouse or by Enter or Space after
selecting the button with Tab or arrows). Then a message box
will appear asking you to press that key. Do it and wait
until the message box disappears. If you want to abort, just
press Escape once and wait.</p>

<p>When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.
The definitions for the keys you have redefined will be
written into the [termi- nal:TERM] section of your ~/.mc/ini
file (where TERM is the name of your current terminal). The
definitions of the keys that were already working properly
are not saved.</p>

<p>Virtual FS This option gives you control over the
settings of the Virtual File System.</p>

<p>The Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information
related to some of the virtual file systems to speed up the
access to the files in the file system (for example,
directory listings fetched from FTP servers).</p>

<p>Also, in order to access the contents of compressed
files (for example, compressed tar files) the Midnight
Commander needs to create temporary uncompressed files on
your disk.</p>

<p>Since both the information in memory and the temporary
files on disk take up resources, you may want to tune the
parameters of the cached information to decrease your
resource usage or to maximize the speed of access to
frequently used file systems.</p>

<p>Because of the format of the tar archives, the Tar
filesystem needs to read the whole file just to load the
file entries. Since most tar files are usually kept
compressed (plain tar files are species in extinction), the
tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk in a
temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as
a reg- ular tar file.</p>

<p>Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all
over the disk, it s common that you will leave a tar file
and the re-enter it later. Since decompression is slow, the
Midnight Commander will cache the information in memory for
a limited time. When the timeout expires, all the resources
associated with the file system are released. The default
timeout is set to one minute.</p>

<p>The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to browse
directories on remote FTP servers. It has several
options.</p>

<p>ftp anonymous password is the password used when you
login as &quot;anony- mous&quot;. Some sites require a valid
e-mail address. On the other hand, you probably dont want to
give your real e-mail address to untrusted sites, especially
if you are not using spam filtering.</p>

<p>ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP
server in a cache. The cache expire time is configurable
with the ftpfs directory cache timeout option. A low value
for this option may slow down every operation on the ftpfs
because every operation would require sending a request to
the FTP server.</p>

<p>You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP. Note
that most modern firewalls are fully transparent at least
for passive FTP (see below), so FTP proxies are considered
obsolete.</p>

<p>If Always use ftp proxy is not set, you can use the
exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain hosts. See FTP
File System for examples.</p>

<p>If this option is set, the program will do two things:
consult the /usr/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines
containing host names that are local (if the host name
starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a domain) and to
assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are
directly accessible. All other hosts will be accessed
through the specified FTP proxy.</p>

<p>You can enable using ~/.netrc file, which keeps login
names and pass- words for ftp servers. See netrc (5) for the
description of the .netrc format.</p>

<p>Use passive mode enables using FTP passive mode, when
the connection for data transfer is initiated by the client,
not by the server. This option is recommended and enabled by
default. If this option is turned off, the data connection
is initiated by the server. This may not work with some
firewalls.</p>

<p>Save Setup At startup the Midnight Commander will try to
load initialization information from the ~/.mc/ini file. If
this file doesnt exist, it will load the information from
the system-wide configuration file, located in
/usr/share/mc/mc.ini. If the system-wide configuration file
doesnt exist, MC uses the default settings.</p>

<p>The Save Setup command creates the ~/.mc/ini file by
saving the current settings of the Left, Right and Options
menus.</p>

<p>If you activate the auto save setup option, MC will
always save the current settings when exiting.</p>

<p>There also exist settings which cant be changed from the
menus. To change these settings you have to edit the setup
file with your favorite editor. See the section on Special
Settings for more informa- tion.</p>

<p>Executing operating system commands You may execute
commands by typing them directly in the Midnight Com-
manders input line, or by selecting the program you want to
execute with the selection bar in one of the panels and
hitting Enter.</p>

<p>If you press Enter over a file that is not executable,
the Midnight Commander checks the extension of the selected
file against the exten- sions in the Extensions File. If a
match is found then the code asso- ciated with that
extension is executed. A very simple macro expansion takes
place before executing the command.</p>

<p>The cd internal command The cd command is interpreted by
the Midnight Commander, it is not passed to the command
shell for execution. Thus it may not handle all of the nice
macro expansion and substitution that your shell does,
although it does some of them:</p>

<p>Tilde substitution. The (~) will be substituted with
your home direc- tory, if you append a username after the
tilde, then it will be substi- tuted with the login
directory of the specified user.</p>

<p>For example, ~guest is the home directory for the user
guest, while ~/guest is the directory guest in your home
directory.</p>

<p>Previous directory. You can jump to the directory you
were previously by using the special directory name - like
this: cd -</p>

<p>CDPATH directories. If the directory specified to the cd
command is not in the current directory, then The Midnight
Commander uses the value in the environment variable CDPATH
to search for the directory in any of the named
directories.</p>

<p>For example you could set your CDPATH variable to
~/src:/usr/src, allowing you to change your directory to any
of the directories inside the ~/src and /usr/src
directories, from any place in the file system by using its
relative name (for example cd linux could take you to
/usr/src/linux).</p>

<p>Macro Substitution When accessing a user menu, or
executing an extension dependent com- mand, or running a
command from the command line input, a simple macro
substitution takes place.</p>

<p>The macros are:</p>

<p>%i The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column
position. For edit menu only.</p>

<p>%y The syntax type of current file. For edit menu
only.</p>

<p>%k The block file name.</p>

<p>%e The error file name.</p>

<p>%m The current menu name.</p>

<p>%f and %p The current file name.</p>

<p>%x The extension of current file name.</p>

<p>%b The current file name without extension.</p>

<p>%d The current directory name.</p>

<p>%F The current file in the unselected panel.</p>

<p>%D The directory name of the unselected panel.</p>

<p>%t The currently tagged files.</p>

<p>%T The tagged files in the unselected panel.</p>

<p>%u and %U Similar to the %t and %T macros, but in
addition the files are untagged. You can use this macro only
once per menu file entry or extension file entry, because
next time there will be no tagged files.</p>

<p>%s and %S The selected files: The tagged files if there
are any. Otherwise the current file.</p>

<p>%cd This is a special macro that is used to change the
current directory to the directory specified in front of it.
This is used primarily as an interface to the Virtual File
System.</p>

<p>%view This macro is used to invoke the internal viewer.
This macro can be used alone, or with arguments. If you pass
any arguments to this macro, they should be enclosed in
brackets.</p>

<p>The arguments are: ascii to force the viewer into ascii
mode; hex to force the viewer into hex mode; nroff to tell
the viewer that it should interpret the bold and underline
sequences of nroff; unformatted to tell the viewer to not
interpret nroff commands for making the text bold or
underlined.</p>

<p>%% The % character</p>

<p>%{some text} Prompt for the substitution. An input box
is shown and the text inside the braces is used as a prompt.
The macro is substituted by the text typed by the user. The
user can press ESC or F10 to cancel. This macro doesnt work
on the command line yet.</p>

<p>%var{ENV:default} If environment variable ENV is unset,
the default is substi- tuted. Otherwise, the value of ENV is
substituted.</p>

<p>The subshell support The subshell support is a compile
time option, that works with the shells: bash, tcsh and
zsh.</p>

<p>When the subshell code is activated the Midnight
Commander will spawn a concurrent copy of your shell (the
one defined in the SHELL variable and if it is not defined,
then the one in the /etc/passwd file) and run it in a pseudo
terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you
execute a command, the command will be passed to the
subshell as if you had typed it. This also allows you to
change the environment vari- ables, use shell functions and
define aliases that are valid until you quit the Midnight
Commander.</p>

<p>If you are using bash you can specify startup commands
for the subshell in your ~/.mc/bashrc file and special
keyboard maps in the ~/.mc/inpu- trc file. tcsh users may
specify startup commands in the ~/.mc/tcshrc file.</p>

<p>When the subshell code is used, you can suspend
applications at any time with the sequence C-o and jump back
to the Midnight Commander, if you interrupt an application,
you will not be able to run other exter- nal commands until
you quit the application you interrupted.</p>

<p>An extra added feature of using the subshell is that the
prompt dis- played by the Midnight Commander is the same
prompt that you are cur- rently using in your shell.</p>

<p>The OPTIONS section has more information on how you can
control the subshell code.</p>

<p>Chmod The Chmod window is used to change the attribute
bits in a group of files and directories. It can be invoked
with the C-x c key combina- tion.</p>

<p>The Chmod window has two parts - Permissions and
File.</p>

<p>In the File section are displayed the name of the file
or directory and its permissions in octal form, as well as
its owner and group.</p>

<p>In the Permissions section there is a set of check
buttons which corre- spond to the file attribute bits. As
you change the attribute bits, you can see the octal value
change in the File section.</p>

<p>To move between the widgets (buttons and check buttons)
use the arrow keys or the Tab key. To change the state of
the check buttons or to select a button use Space. You can
also use the hotkeys on the buttons to quickly activate
them. Hotkeys are shown as highlighted letters on the
buttons.</p>

<p>To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.</p>

<p>When working with a group of files or directories, you
just click on the bits you want to set or clear. Once you
have selected the bits you want to change, you select one of
the action buttons (Set marked or Clear marked).</p>

<p>Finally, to set the attributes exactly to those
specified, you can use the [Set all] button, which will act
on all the tagged files.</p>

<p>[Marked all] set only marked attributes to all selected
files</p>

<p>[Set marked] set marked bits in attributes of all
selected files</p>

<p>[Clean marked] clear marked bits in attributes of all
selected files</p>

<p>[Set] set the attributes of one file</p>

<p>[Cancel] cancel the Chmod command</p>

<p>Chown The Chown command is used to change the
owner/group of a file. The hot key for this command is C-x
o.</p>

<p>Advanced Chown The Advanced Chown command is the Chmod
and Chown command combined into one window. You can change
the permissions and owner/group of files at once.</p>

<p>File Operations When you copy, move or delete files the
Midnight Commander shows the file operations dialog. It
shows the files currently being processed and uses up to
three progress bars. The file bar indicates the per- centage
of the current file that has been processed so far. The
count bar shows how many of the tagged files have been
handled. The bytes bar indicates the percentage of the total
size of the tagged files that has been handled. If the
verbose option is off, the file and bytes bars are not
shown.</p>

<p>There are two buttons at the bottom of the dialog.
Pressing the Skip button will skip the rest of the current
file. Pressing the Abort but- ton will abort the whole
operation, the rest of the files are skipped.</p>

<p>There are three other dialogs which you can run into
during the file operations.</p>

<p>The error dialog informs about error conditions and has
three choices. Normally you select either the Skip button to
skip the file or the Abort button to abort the operation
altogether. You can also select the Retry button if you
fixed the problem from another terminal.</p>

<p>The replace dialog is shown when you attempt to copy or
move a file on the top of an existing file. The dialog shows
the dates and sizes of the both files. Press the Yes button
to overwrite the file, the No button to skip the file, the
All button to overwrite all the files, the None button to
never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if the
source file is newer than the target file. You can abort the
whole operation by pressing the Abort button.</p>

<p>The recursive delete dialog is shown when you try to
delete a directory which is not empty. Press the Yes button
to delete the directory recursively, the No button to skip
the directory, the All button to delete all the directories
and the None button to skip all the non-empty directories.
You can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort
button. If you selected the Yes or All button you will be
asked for a confirmation. Type &quot;yes&quot; only if you
are really sure you want to do the recursive delete.</p>

<p>If you have tagged files and perform an operation on
them only the files on which the operation succeeded are
untagged. Failed and skipped files are left tagged.</p>

<p>Mask Copy/Rename The copy/move operations let you
translate the names of files in an easy way. To do it, you
have to specify the correct source mask and usually in the
trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards. All
the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed
according to the target mask. If there are tagged files,
only the tagged files matching the source mask are
renamed.</p>

<p>There are other options which you can set:</p>

<p>Follow links</p>

<p>determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in
the source direc- tory (recursively in subdirectories) new
links in the target directory or whether would you like to
copy their content.</p>

<p>Dive into subdirs</p>

<p>determines the behavior when the source directory is
about to be copied, but the target directory already exists.
The default action is to copy the contents of the source
directory into the target directory. Enabling this option
causes copying the source directory itself into the target
directory.</p>

<p>For example, you want to copy directory /foo containing
file bar to /bla/foo, which is an already existing
directory. Normally (when Dive into subdirs is not set), mc
would copy file /foo/bar into the file /bla/foo/bar. By
enabling this option the /bla/foo/foo directory will be
created, and /foo/bar will be copied into
/bla/foo/foo/bar.</p>

<p>Preserve attributes</p>

<p>determines whether to preserve the permissions,
timestamps and (if you are root) the ownership of the
original files. If this option is not set, the current value
of the umask will be respected.</p>

<p>Use shell patterns on</p>

<p>When the shell patterns option is on you can use the *
and ? wild- cards in the source mask. They work like they do
in the shell. In the target mask only the * and
&lt;digit&gt; wildcards are allowed. The first * wildcard in
the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in
the source mask, the second * corresponds to the second
group and so on. The 1 wildcard corresponds to the first
wildcard group in the source mask, the 2 wildcard
corresponds to the second group and so on all the way up to
9. The wildcard is the whole filename of the source
file.</p>

<p>Two examples:</p>

<p>If the source mask is &quot;*.tar.gz&quot;, the
destination is &quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the file to be
copied is &quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will be
&quot;foo.tgz&quot; in &quot;/bla&quot;.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that
&quot;file.c&quot; would become &quot;c.file&quot; and so
on. The source mask for this is &quot;*.*&quot; and the
destination is &quot;2.1&quot;.</p>

<p>Use shell patterns off</p>

<p>When the shell patterns option is off the MC doesnt do
automatic grouping anymore. You must use . expressions in
the source mask to specify meaning for the wildcards in the
target mask. This is more flexible but also requires more
typing. Otherwise target masks are sim- ilar to the
situation when the shell patterns option is on.</p>

<p>Two examples:</p>

<p>If the source mask is &quot;^.tar.gz$&quot;, the
destination is &quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the file to be
copied is &quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will be
&quot;/bla/foo.tgz&quot;.</p>

<p>Lets suppose you want to swap basename and extension so
that &quot;file.c&quot; will become &quot;c.file&quot; and
so on. The source mask for this is &quot;^.$&quot; and the
destination is &quot;2.1&quot;.</p>

<p>Case Conversions</p>

<p>You can also change the case of the filenames. If you
use or in the target mask, the next character will be
converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.</p>

<p>If you use U or n the target mask, the next characters
will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly
up to the next or next U, r the end of the file name.</p>

<p>The and re stronger than U and For example, if the
source mask is * (shell patterns on) or ^$ (shell patterns
off) and the target mask is * the file names will be
converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower
case.</p>

<p>You can also use as a quote character. For example, \ is
a back- is an asterisk. slash and Stable symlinks</p>

<p>commands Midnight Commander, that it should change
symlinks in the tar- get, so that theyll point to the same
location as it did before. With absolute symbolic links this
does nothing, but if you have a relative one, it will
recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and other direc-
tory parts and making the value as short as possible (most
modern filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and
thus don t waste much disk space).</p>

<p>Select/Unselect Files The dialog of group of files and
directories selection or uselection. The input line allow
enter the regular expression of filenames that will be
selected/unselected.</p>

<p>When Files only checkbox is on, only files will be
selected. If Files only is off, as files as directories will
be selected. When Shell Pat- terns checkbox is on, the
regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the
shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing
for one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the
tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions
(see ed (1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the
selection will be case sensitive characters. If Case
sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.</p>

<p>Internal File Viewer The internal file viewer provides
two display modes: ASCII and hex. To toggle between modes,
use the F4 key.</p>

<p>The viewer will try to use the best method provided by
your system or the file type to display the information.
Some character sequences, which appear most often in
preformatted manual pages, are displayed bold and
underlined, thus making a pretty display of your files.</p>

<p>When in hex mode, the search function accepts text in
quotes and con- stant numbers. Text in quotes is matched
exactly after removing the quotes. Each number matches one
byte. You can mix quoted text with constants like this:</p>

<p>&quot;String&quot; -1 0xBB 012 &quot;more text&quot;</p>

<p>Note that 012 is an octal number. -1 is converted to
0xFF.</p>

<p>Here is a listing of the actions associated with each
key that the Mid- night Commander handles in the internal
file viewer.</p>

<p>F1 Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.</p>

<p>F2 Toggle the wrap mode.</p>

<p>F4 Toggle the hex mode.</p>

<p>F5 Goto line. This will prompt you for a line number and
will display that line.</p>

<p>F6, /. Regular expression search.</p>

<p>?, Reverse regular expression search.</p>

<p>F7 Normal search / hex mode search.</p>

<p>C-s, F17, n. Start normal search if there was no
previous search expression else find next match.</p>

<p>C-r. Start reverse search if there was no previous
search expression else find next match.</p>

<p>F8 Toggle Raw/Parsed mode: This will show the file as
found on disk or if a processing filter has been specified
in the mc.ext file, then the output from the filter. Current
mode is always the other than written on the button label,
since on the button is the mode which you enter by that
key.</p>

<p>F9 Toggle the format/unformat mode: when format mode is
on the viewer will interpret some string sequences to show
bold and underline with different colors. Also, on button
label is the other mode than current.</p>

<p>F10, Esc. Exit the internal file viewer.</p>

<p>next-page, space, C-v. Scroll one page forward.</p>

<p>prev-page, Alt-v, C-b, backspace. Scroll one page
backward.</p>

<p>down-key Scroll one line forward.</p>

<p>up-key Scroll one line backward.</p>

<p>C-l Refresh the screen.</p>

<p>C-o Switch to the subshell and show the command
screen.</p>

<p>! Like C-o, but run a new shell if the subshell is not
running.</p>

<p>[n] m Set the mark n.</p>

<p>[n] r Jump to the mark n.</p>

<p>C-f Jump to the next file.</p>

<p>C-b Jump to the previous file.</p>

<p>Alt-r Toggle the ruler.</p>

<p>Alt-e to change charset of displayed text may use M-e
(Alt-e). Recod- ing is made from selected codepage into
system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may select
&quot;&lt;No translation&gt;&quot; in charset selection
dialog.</p>

<p>Its possible to instruct the file viewer how to display
a file, look at the Extension File Edit section</p>

<p>Internal File Editor The internal file editor is a
full-featured full screen editor. It can edit files up to 64
megabytes. It is possible to edit binary files. The internal
file editor is invoked using F4 if the use_internal_edit
option is set in the initialization file.</p>

<p>The features it presently supports are: block copy,
move, delete, cut, paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus;
file insertion; macro com- mands; regular expression search
and replace; shift-arrow text high- lighting (if supported
by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap;
autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for
various file types; and an option to pipe text blocks
through shell commands like indent and ispell.</p>

<p>Sections:</p>

<p>Options of editor in ini-file</p>

<p>The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring.
To see what keys do what, just consult the appropriate
pull-down menu. Other keys are: Shift movement keys do text
highlighting. Ctrl-Ins copies to the file cooledit.clip and
Shift-Ins pastes from cooledit.clip. Shift-Del cuts to
cooledit.clip, and Ctrl-Del deletes highlighted text. Mouse
highlighting also works, and you can override the mouse as
usual by holding down the shift key while dragging the mouse
to let normal terminal mouse highlighting work.</p>

<p>To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the
key strokes you want to be executed. Press Ctrl-R again when
finished. You can then assign the macro to any key you like
by pressing that key. The macro is executed when you press
Ctrl-A and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed
if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key,
provided that the key is not used for any other function.
Once defined, the macro commands go into the file
.mc/cedit/cooledit.macros in your home directory. You can
delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line in this
file.</p>

<p>To change charset of displayed text may use M-e (Alt-e).
Recoding is made from selected codepage into system
codepage. To cancel the recod- ing you may select
&quot;&lt;No translation&gt;&quot; in charset selection
dialog.</p>

<p>F19 will format the currently highlighted block (plain
text or C or C++ code or another). This is controlled by the
file /usr/share/mc/edit.indent.rc which is copied to
.mc/cedit/edit.indent.rc in your home directory the first
time you use it.</p>

<p>The editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When
editing binary files, you should set display bits to 7 bits
in the options menu to keep the spacing clean.</p>

<p>Options of editor in ini-file In this section described
some options in ini-file. Options placed in [Midnight
Commander] section</p>

<p>editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file Search
autocomplete candidates in entire of file or just from begin
of file to cursor position (0)</p>

<p>Completion Let the Midnight Commander type for you.</p>

<p>Attempt to perform completion on the text before current
position. MC attempts completion treating the text as
variable (if the text begins with $), username (if the text
begins with ~), hostname (if the text begins with @) or
command (if you are on the command line in the posi- tion
where you might type a command, possible completions then
include shell reserved words and shell built-in commands as
well) in turn. If none of these matches, filename completion
is attempted.</p>

<p>Filename, username, variable and hostname completion
works on all input lines, command completion is command line
specific. If the completion is ambiguous (there are more
different possibilities), MC beeps and the following action
depends on the setting of the Complete: show all option in
the Configuration dialog. If it is enabled, a list of all
possibilities pops up next to the current position and you
can select with the arrow keys and Enter the correct entry.
You can also type the first letters in which the
possibilities differ to move to a subset of all
possibilities and complete as much as possible. If you press
Alt-Tab again, only the subset will be shown in the listbox,
otherwise the first item which matches all the previous
characters will be high- lighted. As soon as there is no
ambiguity, dialog disappears, but you can hide it by
canceling keys Esc, F10 and left and right arrow keys. If
Complete: show all is disabled, the dialog pops up only if
you press Alt-Tab for the second time, for the first time MC
just beeps.</p>

<p>Virtual File System The Midnight Commander is provided
with a code layer to access the file system; this code layer
is known as the virtual file system switch. The virtual file
system switch allows the Midnight Commander to manipu- late
files not located on the Unix file system.</p>

<p>Currently the Midnight Commander is packaged with some
Virtual File Systems (VFS): the local file system, used for
accessing the regular Unix file system; the ftpfs, used to
manipulate files on remote systems with the FTP protocol;
the tarfs, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files;
the undelfs, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file sys-
tems (the default file system for Linux systems), fish (for
manipulat- ing files over shell connections such as rsh and
ssh) and finally the mcfs (Midnight Commander file system),
a network based file system. If the code was compiled with
smbfs support, you can manipulate files on remote systems
with the SMB (CIFS) protocol.</p>

<p>A generic extfs (EXTernal virtual File System) is
provided in order to easily expand VFS capabilities using
scripts and external software.</p>

<p>The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names
used and will forward them to the correct file system, the
formats used for each one of the file systems is described
later in their own section.</p>

<p>FTP File System The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you
to manipulate files on remote machines. To actually use it,
you can use the FTP link item in the menu or directly change
your current directory using the cd command to a path name
that looks like this:</p>

<p>/#ftp:[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]</p>

<p>The user, port and remote-dir elements are optional. If
you specify the user element, the Midnight Commander will
login to the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will
use anonymous login or the login name from the ~/.netrc
file. The optional pass element is the password used for the
connection. Using the password in the VFS direc- tory name
is not recommended, because it can appear on the screen in
clear text and can be saved to the directory history.</p>

<p>To enable using FTP proxy, prepend ! (an exclamation
sign) to the hostname.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>/#ftp:ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
/#ftp:tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
/#ftp:!behind.firewall.edu/pub
/#ftp:guest@remote-host.com:40/pub
/#ftp:miguel:xxx@server/pub</p>

<p>Please check the Virtual File System dialog box for
ftpfs options.</p>

<p>Tar File System The tar file system provides you with
read-only access to your tar files and compressed tar files
by using the chdir command. To change your directory to a
tar file, you change your current directory to the tar file
by using the following syntax:</p>

<p>/filename.tar#utar/[dir-inside-tar]</p>

<p>The mc.ext file already provides a shortcut for tar
files, this means that usually you just point to a tar file
and press return to enter into the tar file, see the
Extension File Edit section for details on how this is
done.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>mc-3.0.tar.gz#utar/mc-3.0/vfs
/ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar#utar</p>

<p>The latter specifies the full path of the tar
archive.</p>

<p>FIle transfer over SHell filesystem The fish file system
is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate
the files in a remote machine as if they were local. To use
this, the other side has to either run fish server, or has
to have bash-compatible shell.</p>

<p>To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir
into a special directory which name is in the following
format:</p>

<p>/#sh:[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]</p>

<p>The user, options and remote-dir elements are optional.
If you specify the user element, the Midnight Commander will
try to login on the remote machine as that user, otherwise
it will use your login name.</p>

<p>The options are C - use compression and rsh use rsh
instead of ssh. If the remote-dir element is present, your
current directory on the remote machine will be set to this
one.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>/#sh:onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
/#sh:joe@want.compression.edu:C/private
/#sh:joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private</p>

<p>Network File System The Midnight Commander file system
is a network base file system that allows you to manipulate
the files in a remote machine as if they were local. To use
this, the remote machine must be running the mcserv(8)
server program.</p>

<p>To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir
into a special directory which name is in the following
format:</p>

<p>/#mc:[user@]machine[:port][remote-dir]</p>

<p>The user, port and remote-dir elements are optional. If
you specify the user element then the Midnight Commander
will try to logon on the remote machine as that user,
otherwise it will use your login name.</p>

<p>The port element is used when the remote server is
running on a special port (see the mcserv(8) manual page for
more information about ports); finally, if the remote-dir
element is present, your current directory on the remote
machine will be set to this one.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>/#mc:ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
/#mc:joe@foo.edu:11321/private</p>

<p>Undelete File System On Linux systems, if you asked
configure to use the ext2fs undelete facilities, you will
have the undelete file system available. Recovery of deleted
files is only available on ext2 file systems. The undelete
file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to
retrieve all of the deleted files names on an ext2fs and
provides and to extract the selected files into a regular
partition.</p>

<p>To use this file system, you have to chdir into the
special file name formed by the &quot;/#undel&quot; prefix
and the file name where the actual file system resides.</p>

<p>For example, to recover deleted files on the second
partition of the first SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the
following path name:</p>

<p>/#undel:sda2</p>

<p>It may take a while for the undelfs to load the required
information before you start browsing files there.</p>

<p>SMB File System The smbfs allows you to manipulate files
on remote machines with SMB (or CIFS) protocol. These
include Windows for Workgroups, Windows 9x/ME/XP, Windows
NT, Windows 2000 and Samba. To actually use it, you may try
to use the panel command &quot;SMB link...&quot; (accessible
from the menubar) or you may directly change your current
directory to it using the cd command to a path name that
looks like this:</p>

<p>/#smb:[user@]machine[/service][/remote-dir]</p>

<p>The user, service and remote-dir elements are optional.
The user, domain and password can be specified in an input
dialog.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>/#smb:machine/Share /#smb:other_machine
/#smb:guest@machine/Public/Irlex</p>

<p>EXTernal File System extfs allows to integrate numerous
features and file types into GNU Midnight Commander in an
easy way, by writing scripts.</p>

<p>Extfs filesystems can be divided into two
categories:</p>

<p>1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated
with any existing file. They represent certain system-wide
data as a directory tree. You can invoke them by typing cd
#fsname where fsname is an extfs short name (see below).
Examples of such filesystems include audio (list audio
tracks on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in the
system).</p>

<p>For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM
drive, type</p>

<p>cd #audio</p>

<p>2. Archive filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more),
which represent contents of a file as a directory tree. It
can consist of real files compressed in an archive (urar,
rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a mailbox (mailfs)
or parts of a patch (patchfs). To access such filesystems
#fsname should be appended to the archive name. Note that
the archive itself can be on another vfs.</p>

<p>For example, to list contents of a zip archive
documents.zip type</p>

<p>cd documents.zip#uzip</p>

<p>In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other
directory. For instance, you can add it to the hotlist or
change to it from directory history. An important limitation
is that you cannot invoke shell com- mands inside extfs,
just like any other non-local VFS.</p>

<p>Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander
are:</p>

<p>a access A: DOS/Windows diskette (cd #a).</p>

<p>apt front end to Debians APT package management system
(cd #apt).</p>

<p>audio audio CD ripping and playing (cd #audio or cd
device#audio).</p>

<p>bpp package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution (cd
file.bpp#bpp).</p>

<p>deb package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution (cd
file.deb#deb).</p>

<p>dpkg Debian GNU/Linux installed packages (cd #deb).</p>

<p>hp48 view and copy files to/from a HP48 calculator (cd
#hp48).</p>

<p>lslR browsing of lslR listings as found on many FTPs (cd
file- name#lslR).</p>

<p>mailfs mbox-style mailbox files support (cd
mailbox#mailfs).</p>

<p>patchfs extfs to handle unified and context diffs (cd
filename#patchfs).</p>

<p>rpm RPM package (cd filename#rpm).</p>

<p>rpms RPM database management (cd #rpms).</p>

<p>ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha archivers (cd
archive#xxxx where xxxx is one of: ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo,
uar, uha).</p>

<p>You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as
described in the Extension File Edit section. Here is an
example entry for Debian packages:</p>

<p>regex/.deb$ Open=%cd %p#deb</p>

<p>Colors The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your
terminal supports color using the terminal database and your
terminal name. Sometimes it gets confused, so you may force
color mode or disable color mode using the -c and -b flag
respectively.</p>

<p>If the program is compiled with the Slang screen manager
instead of ncurses, it will also check the variable
COLORTERM, if it is set, it has the same effect as the -c
flag.</p>

<p>You may specify terminals that always force color mode
by adding the color_terminals variable to the Colors section
of the initialization file. This will prevent the Midnight
Commander from trying to detect if your terminal supports
color. Example:</p>

<p>[Colors] color_terminals=linux,xterm
color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...</p>

<p>The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang,
ncurses does not provide a way to force color mode: ncurses
uses just the informa- tion in the terminal database.</p>

<p>The Midnight Commander provides a way to change the
default colors. Currently the colors are configured using
the environment variable MC_COLOR_TABLE or the Colors
section in the initialization file.</p>

<p>In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded
from the base_color variable. You can specify an alternate
color map for a ter- minal by using the terminal name as the
key in this section. Example:</p>

<p>[Colors] base_color=
xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red</p>

<p>The format for the color definition is:</p>


<p>&lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;foregroundcolor&gt;,&lt;backgroundcolor&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=
...</p>

<p>The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal,
selected, marked, markselect, errors, input, reverse, gauge.
Menu colors are: menu, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel. Dialog
colors are: dnormal, dfo- cus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus. Help
colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink,
helpslink. Viewer color is: viewunderline. Editor colors
are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked.</p>

<p>input determines the color of input lines used in query
dialogs.</p>

<p>gauge determines the color of the filled part of the
progress bar (gauge), which is used to show the user the
progress of file opera- tions, such as copying.</p>

<p>The dialog boxes use the following colors: dnormal is
used for the nor- mal text, dfocus is the color used for the
currently selected compo- nent, dhotnormal is the color used
to differentiate the hotkey color in normal components,
whereas the dhotfocus color is used for the high- lighted
color in the currently selected component.</p>

<p>Menus use the same scheme but uses the menu, menusel,
menuhot and menuhotsel tags instead.</p>

<p>Help uses the following colors: helpnormal is used for
normal text, helpitalic is used for text which is emphasized
in italic in the manual page, helpbold is used for text
which is emphasized in bold in the man- ual page, helplink
is used for not selected hyperlinks and helpslink is used
for selected hyperlink.</p>

<p>The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred,
green, bright- green, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue,
magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and
white. And there is a special keyword for transparent
background. It is default. The default can only be used for
background color. Example:</p>

<p>[Colors]
base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default</p>

<p>Skins You can change the appearance of Midhight
Commander. To do this, you must specify a file that contain
descriptions of colors and lines to draw boxes. Redefining
of the colors is entirely compatible with the assignment of
colors, as described in Section Colors.</p>

<p>A skin-file is searched on the following algorithm (to
the first one found):</p>

<p>1) command line option -S &lt;skin&gt; or
--skin=&lt;skin&gt; 2) Environment variable MC_SKIN 3) In
config file parameter skin in section [Midnight Commander]
4) File /etc/mc/skins/default.ini 5) File
/usr/share/mc/skins/default.ini</p>

<p>Command line option, environment variable and parameter
in config file may contain the absolute path to the
skin-file (with the extension .ini or without it). Search of
skin-file will occur in (to the first one found):</p>

<p>1) ~/.mc/skins/ 2) /etc/mc/skins/ 3)
/usr/share/mc/skins/</p>

the skin files and is complementary.</p>

<p>Filenames Highlight Section [filehighlight] from current
skin-file contain key names as highlight groups and values
as color pairs. Color pairs is documented into Skins
section.</p>

<p>Rules of filenames highlight placed in
/usr/share/mc/filehighlight.ini file
(~/.mc/filehighlight.ini). Name of section in this file must
be equal to parameters names into [filehighlight] section
(in current skin-file)</p>

<p>Keys in these groups:</p>

<p>type file type. if present, all other option ignored</p>

<p>regexp regular expression. If present, extensions option
ignored</p>

<p>extensions list of extensions of files. Separated by ;
sign.</p>

<p>extensions_case (make sense only with extensions
parameter) make extensions rule case sentitive (true) or not
(false).</p>

<p>type key may have values: - FILE (all files) - FILE_EXE
- DIR (all directories) - LINK_DIR - LINK (all links except
stale link) - HARDLINK - SYMLINK - STALE_LINK - DEVICE (all
device files) - DEVICE_BLOCK - DEVICE_CHAR - SPECIAL (all
special files) - SPECIAL_SOCKET - SPECIAL_FIFO -
SPECIAL_DOOR</p>

<p>Special Settings Most of the settings of the Midnight
Commander can be changed from the menus. However, there are
a small number of settings which can only be changed by
editing the setup file.</p>

<p>These variables may be set in your ~/.mc/ini file:</p>

<p>clear_before_exec By default the Midnight Commander
clears the screen before exe- cuting a command. If you would
prefer to see the output of the command at the bottom of the
screen, edit your ~/.mc/ini file and change the value of the
field clear_before_exec to 0.</p>

<p>confirm_view_dir If you press F3 on a directory,
normally MC enters that direc- tory. If this flag is set to
1, then MC will ask for confirma- tion before changing the
directory if you have files tagged.</p>

<p>ftpfs_retry_seconds This value is the number of seconds
the Midnight Commander will wait before attempting to
reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the login. If the
value is zero, the login will no be retried.</p>

<p>max_dirt_limit Specifies how many screen updates can be
skipped at most in the internal file viewer. Normally this
value is not significant, because the code automatically
adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the rate
of incoming keystrokes. However, on very slow machines or
terminals with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can
make screen updates too jumpy.</p>

<p>It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the
best behavior, and that is the default value.</p>

<p>mouse_move_pages Controls whenever scrolling with the
mouse is done by pages or line by line on the panels.</p>

<p>mouse_move_pages_viewer Controls if scrolling with the
mouse is done by pages or line by line on the internal file
viewer.</p>

<p>old_esc_mode By default the Midnight Commander treats
the ESC key as a key prefix (old_esc_mode=0). If this option
is set (old_esc_mode=1), the ESC key will act as a prefix
key for one second, and if no extra keys have arrived, then
the ESC key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).</p>

<p>only_leading_plus_minus Allow special treatment for +, -
, * in the command line (select, unselect, reverse
selection) only if the command line is empty. You dont need
to quote those characters in the mid- dle of the command
line. On the other hand, you cannot use them to change
selection when the command line is not empty.</p>

<p>reverse_files_only Allow revert selection of files only.
This variable is on by default. If on, the reverse selection
is applied to files only, not to directories. The selection
of directories is untouched. If off, the reverse selection
is applied to files as well to directories: all unselected
items become selected, and vice versa.</p>

<p>panel_scroll_pages If set (the default), panel will
scroll by half the display when the cursor reaches the end
or the beginning of the panel, other- wise it will just
scroll a file at a time.</p>

<p>show_output_starts_shell This variable only works if you
are not using the subshell sup- port. When you use the C-o
keystroke to go back to the user screen, if this one is set,
you will get a fresh shell. Other- wise, pressing any key
will bring you back to the Midnight Com- mander.</p>

<p>torben_fj_mode If this flag is set, then the home and
end keys will work slightly different on the panels, instead
of moving the selec- tion to the first and last files in the
panels, they will act as follows:</p>

<p>The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below
it; else go to the top line unless it is already on the top
line, in this case it will go to the first file in the
panel.</p>

<p>The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the
middle line, if over it; else go to the bottom line unless
you already are at the bottom line, in such case it will
move the selection to the last file name in the panel.</p>

<p>use_file_to_guess_type If this variable is on (the
default) it will spawn the file com- mand to match the file
types listed on the mc.ext file.</p>

<p>xterm_mode If this variable is on (default is off) when
you browse the file system on a Tree panel, it will
automatically reload the other panel with the contents of
the selected directory.</p>

<p>fish_directory_timeout This variable holds the lifetime
of a directory cache entry in seconds. The default value is
900 seconds.</p>

<p>Terminal databases The Midnight Commander provides a way
to fix your system terminal database without requiring root
privileges. The Midnight Commander searches in the system
initialization file (the mc.lib file located in the Midnight
Commander library directory) and in the ~/.mc/ini file for
the section &quot;terminal:your-terminal-name&quot; and then
for the section &quot;terminal:general&quot;, each line of
the section contains a key symbol that you want to define,
followed by an equal sign and the definition for the key.
You can use the special \ form to represent the escape char-
acter and the ^x to represent the control-x character.</p>

<p>The possible key symbols are:</p>

<p>f0 to f20 Function keys f0-f20 bs backspace home home
key end end key up up arrow key down down arrow key left
left arrow key right right arrow key pgdn page down key pgup
page up key insert the insert character delete the delete
character complete to do completion</p>

<p>For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape +
[ + O + p, you set this in the ini file:</p>

<p>insert=\[Op</p>

<p>Also now you can use extended learn keys. For
example:</p>

<p>ctrl-alt-right=\[[1;6C ctrl-alt-left=\[[1;6D</p>

<p>This means that ctrl+alt+left sends a \[[1;6D escape
sequence and therefore Midnight Commander interprets
&quot;\[[1;6D&quot; as Ctrl-Alt-Left.</p>

<p>The complete key symbol represents the escape sequences
used to invoke the completion process, this is invoked with
Alt-tab, but you can define other keys to do the same work
(on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys
everywhere).</p>
