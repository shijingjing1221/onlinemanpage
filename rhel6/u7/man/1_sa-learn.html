<p>DESCRIPTION Given a typical selection of your incoming
mail classified as spam or ham (non-spam), this tool will
feed each mail to SpamAssassin, allowing it to learn what
signs are likely to mean spam, and which are likely to mean
ham.</p>

<p>Simply run this command once for each of your mail
folders, and it will learn from the mail therein.</p>

<p>Note that csh-style globbing in the mail folder names is
supported; in other words, listing a folder name as
&quot;*&quot; will scan every folder that matches. See
&quot;Mail::SpamAssassin::ArchiveIterator&quot; for more
details.</p>

<p>SpamAssassin remembers which mail messages it has learnt
already, and will not re-learn those messages again, unless
you use the --forget option. Messages learnt as spam will
have SpamAssassin markup removed, on the fly.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake and scan a mail as ham when it is
spam, or vice versa, simply rerun this command with the
correct classification, and the mistake will be corrected.
SpamAssassin will automatically forget the previous
indications.</p>

<p>Users of &quot;spamd&quot; who wish to perform training
remotely, over a network, should investigate the &quot;spamc
-L&quot; switch.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --ham Learn the input message(s) as ham. If you
have previously learnt any of the messages as spam,
SpamAssassin will forget them first, then re-learn them as
ham. Alternatively, if you have previously learnt them as
ham, itll skip them this time around. If the messages have
already been filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner will
ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may have made.</p>

<p>--spam Learn the input message(s) as spam. If you have
previously learnt any of the messages as ham, SpamAssassin
will forget them first, then re-learn them as spam.
Alternatively, if you have previously learnt them as spam,
itll skip them this time around. If the messages have
already been filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner will
ignore any modifications SpamAssassin may have made.</p>

<p>--folders=filename, -f filename sa-learn will read in
the list of folders from the specified file, one folder per
line in the file. If the folder is prefixed with
&quot;ham:type:&quot; or &quot;spam:type:&quot;, sa-learn
will learn that folder appropriately, otherwise the folders
will be assumed to be of the type specified by --ham or
--spam.</p>

<p>&quot;type&quot; above is optional, but is the same as
the standard for ArchiveIterator: mbox, mbx, dir, file, or
detect (the default if not specified).</p>

<p>--mbox sa-learn will read in the file(s) containing the
emails to be learned, and will process them in mbox format
(one or more emails per file).</p>

<p>--mbx sa-learn will read in the file(s) containing the
emails to be learned, and will process them in mbx format
(one or more emails per file).</p>

<p>--use-ignores Don t learn the message if a from address
matches configuration file item
&quot;bayes_ignore_from&quot; or a to address matches
&quot;bayes_ignore_to&quot;. The option might be used when
learning from a large file of messages from which the hammy
spam messages or spammy ham messages have not been
removed.</p>

<p>--sync Synchronize the journal and databases. Upon
successfully syncing the database with the entries in the
journal, the journal file is removed.</p>

<p>--force-expire Forces an expiry attempt, regardless of
whether it may be necessary or not. Note: This doesn t mean
any tokens will actually expire. Please see the EXPIRATION
section below.</p>

<p>Note: &quot;--force-expire&quot; also causes the journal
data to be synchronized into the Bayes databases.</p>

<p>--forget Forget a given message previously learnt.</p>

<p>--dbpath Allows a commandline override of the bayes_path
configuration option.</p>

<p>--dump option Display the contents of the Bayes
database. Without an option or with the all option, all
magic tokens and data tokens will be displayed. magic will
only display magic tokens, and data will only display the
data tokens.</p>

<p>Can also use the --regexp RE option to specify which
tokens to display based on a regular expression.</p>

<p>--clear Clear an existing Bayes database by removing all
traces of the database.</p>

<p>WARNING: This is destructive and should be used with
care.</p>

<p>--backup Performs a dump of the Bayes database in
machine/human readable format.</p>

<p>The dump will include token and seen data. It is
suitable for input back into the --restore command.</p>

<p>--restore=filename Performs a restore of the Bayes
database defined by filename.</p>

<p>WARNING: This is a destructive operation, previous Bayes
data will be wiped out.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-u username, --username=username If specified this
username will override the username taken from the runtime
environment. You can use this option to specify users in a
virtual user configuration when using SQL as the Bayes
backend.</p>

<p>NOTE: This option will not change to the given username,
it will only attempt to act on behalf of that user. Because
of this you will need to have proper permissions to be able
to change files owned by username. In the case of SQL this
generally is not a problem.</p>

<p>-C path, --configpath=path, --config-file=path Use the
specified path for locating the distributed configuration
files. Ignore the default directories (usually
&quot;/usr/share/spamassassin&quot; or similar).</p>

<p>--siteconfigpath=path Use the specified path for
locating site-specific configuration files. Ignore the
default directories (usually
&quot;/etc/mail/spamassassin&quot; or similar).</p>

<p>--cfconfig line Add additional lines of configuration
directly from the command- line, parsed after the
configuration files are read. Multiple --cf arguments can be
used, and each will be considered a separate line of
configuration.</p>

<p>-p prefs, --prefspath=prefs, --prefs-file=prefs Read
user score preferences from prefs (usually
&quot;$HOME/.spamassassin/user_prefs&quot;).</p>

<p>--progress Prints a progress bar (to STDERR) showing the
current progress. In the case where no valid terminal is
found this option will behave very much like the --showdots
option.</p>

<p>-D [area,...], --debug [area,...] Produce debugging
output. If no areas are listed, all debugging information is
printed. Diagnostic output can also be enabled for each area
individually; area is the area of the code to instrument.
For example, to produce diagnostic output on bayes, learn,
and dns, use:</p>

<p>spamassassin -D bayes,learn,dns</p>

<p>For more information about which areas (also known as
channels) are available, please see the documentation
at:</p>


<p>C&lt;http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DebugChannels&gt;</p>

<p>Higher priority informational messages that are suitable
for logging in normal circumstances are available with an
area of &quot;info&quot;.</p>

<p>--no-sync Skip the slow synchronization step which
normally takes place after changing database entries. If you
plan to learn from many folders in a batch, or to learn many
individual messages one-by-one, it is faster to use this
switch and run &quot;sa-learn --sync&quot; once all the
folders have been scanned.</p>

<p>Clarification: The state of --no-sync overrides the
bayes_learn_to_journal configuration option. If not
specified, sa- learn will learn to the database directly. If
specified, sa-learn will learn to the journal file.</p>

<p>Note: --sync and --no-sync can be specified on the same
commandline, which is slightly confusing. In this case, the
--no-sync option is ignored since there is no learn
operation.</p>

<p>-L, --local Do not perform any network accesses while
learning details about the mail messages. This will speed up
the learning process, but may result in a slightly lower
accuracy.</p>

<p>Note that this is currently ignored, as current versions
of SpamAssassin will not perform network access while
learning; but future versions may.</p>

<p>--import If you previously used SpamAssassins Bayesian
learner without the &quot;DB_File&quot; module installed, it
will have created files in other formats, such as
&quot;GDBM_File&quot;, &quot;NDBM_File&quot;, or
&quot;SDBM_File&quot;. This switch allows you to migrate
that old data into the &quot;DB_File&quot; format. It will
overwrite any data currently in the &quot;DB_File&quot;.</p>

<p>Can also be used with the --dbpath path option to
specify the location of the Bayes files to use.</p>

<p>MIGRATION There are now multiple backend storage modules
available for storing users bayesian data. As such you might
want to migrate from one backend to another. Here is a
simple procedure for migrating from one backend to
another.</p>

<p>Note that if you have individual user databases you will
have to perform a similar procedure for each one of
them.</p>

<p>sa-learn --sync This will sync any outstanding journal
entries</p>

<p>sa-learn --backup &gt; backup.txt This will save all
your Bayes data to a plain text file.</p>

<p>sa-learn --clear This is optional, but good to do to
clear out the old database.</p>

<p>Repeat! At this point, if you have multiple databases,
you should perform the procedure above for each of them.
(i.e. each users database needs to be backed up before
continuing.)</p>

<p>Switch backends Once you have backed up all databases
you can update your configuration for the new database
backend. This will involve at least the bayes_store_module
config option and may involve some additional config options
depending on what is required by the module. (For example,
you may need to configure an SQL database.)</p>

<p>sa-learn --restore backup.txt Again, you need to do this
for every database.</p>

<p>If you are migrating to SQL you can make use of the -u
&lt;username&gt; option in sa-learn to populate each user s
database. Otherwise, you must run sa-learn as the user who
database you are restoring.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN FILTERING (Thanks to Michael
Bell for this section!)</p>

<p>For a more lengthy description of how this works, go to
http://www.paulgraham.com/ and see &quot;A Plan for
Spam&quot;. Its reasonably readable, even if statistics make
me break out in hives.</p>

<p>The short semi-inaccurate version: Given training, a
spam heuristics engine can take the most &quot;spammy&quot;
and &quot;hammy&quot; words and apply probabilistic
analysis. Furthermore, once given a basis for the analysis,
the engine can continue to learn iteratively by applying
both the non-Bayesian and Bayesian rulesets together to
create evolving &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>

<p>SpamAssassin 2.50 and later supports Bayesian spam
analysis, in the form of the BAYES rules. This is a new
feature, quite powerful, and is disabled until enough
messages have been learnt.</p>

<p>The pros of Bayesian spam analysis:</p>

<p>Can greatly reduce false positives and false negatives.
It learns from your mail, so it is tailored to your unique
e-mail flow.</p>

<p>Once it starts learning, it can continue to learn from
SpamAssassin and improve over time.</p>

<p>And the cons:</p>

<p>A decent number of messages are required before results
are useful for ham/spam determination. Its hard to explain
why a message is or isn t marked as spam. i.e.: a
straightforward rule, that matches, say, &quot;VIAGRA&quot;
is easy to understand. If it generates a false positive or
false negative, it is fairly easy to understand why.</p>

<p>With Bayesian analysis, it s all probabilities -
&quot;because the past says it is likely as this falls into
a probabilistic distribution common to past spam in your
systems&quot;. Tell that to your users! Tell that to the
client when he asks &quot;what can I do to change
this&quot;. (By the way, the answer in this case is
&quot;use whitelisting&quot;.)</p>

<p>It will take disk space and memory. The databases it
maintains take quite a lot of resources to store and
use.</p>

<p>GETTING STARTED Still interested? Ok, here s the
guidelines for getting this working.</p>

<p>First a high-level overview:</p>

<p>Build a significant sample of both ham and spam. I
suggest several thousand of each, placed in SPAM and HAM
directories or mailboxes. Yes, you MUST hand-sort this -
otherwise the results wont be much better than SpamAssassin
on its own. Verify the spamminess/haminess of EVERY message.
You re urged to avoid using a publicly available corpus
(sample) - this must be taken from YOUR mail server, if it
is to be statistically useful. Otherwise, the results may be
pretty skewed.</p>

<p>Use this tool to teach SpamAssassin about these samples,
like so: sa-learn --spam /path/to/spam/folder sa-learn --ham
/path/to/ham/folder ...</p>

<p>Let SpamAssassin proceed, learning stuff. When it finds
ham and spam it will add the &quot;interesting tokens&quot;
to the database.</p>

<p>If you need SpamAssassin to forget about specific
messages, use the --forget option. This can be applied to
either ham or spam that has run through the sa-learn
processes. It s a bit of a hammer, really, lowering the
weighting of the specific tokens in that message (only if
that message has been processed before).</p>

<p>Learning from single messages uses a command like this:
sa-learn --ham --no-sync mailmessage</p>

<p>This is handy for binding to a key in your mail user
agent. Its very fast, as all the time-consuming stuff is
deferred until you run with the &quot;--sync&quot;
option.</p>

<p>Autolearning is enabled by default If you dont have a
corpus of mail saved to learn, you can let SpamAssassin
automatically learn the mail that you receive. If you are
autolearning from scratch, the amount of mail you receive
will determine how long until the BAYES_* rules are
activated.</p>

<p>EFFECTIVE TRAINING Learning filters require training to
be effective. If you dont train them, they wont work. In
addition, you need to train them with new messages regularly
to keep them up-to-date, or their data will become stale and
impact accuracy.</p>

<p>You need to train with both spam and ham mails. One type
of mail alone will not have any effect.</p>

<p>Note that if your mail folders contain things like
forwarded spam, discussions of spam-catching rules, etc.,
this will cause trouble. You should avoid scanning those
messages if possible. (An easy way to do this is to move
them aside, into a folder which is not scanned.)</p>

<p>If the messages you are learning from have already been
filtered through SpamAssassin, the learner will compensate
for this. In effect, it learns what each message would look
like if you had run &quot;spamassassin -d&quot; over it in
advance.</p>

<p>Another thing to be aware of, is that typically you
should aim to train with at least 1000 messages of spam, and
1000 ham messages, if possible. More is better, but anything
over about 5000 messages does not improve accuracy
significantly in our tests.</p>

<p>Be careful that you train from the same source -- for
example, if you train on old spam, but new ham mail, then
the classifier will think that a mail with an old date stamp
is likely to be spam.</p>

<p>It s also worth noting that training with a very small
quantity of ham, will produce atrocious results. You should
aim to train with at least the same amount (or more if
possible!) of ham data than spam.</p>

<p>On an on-going basis, it is best to keep training the
filter to make sure it has fresh data to work from. There
are various ways to do this:</p>

<p>1. Supervised learning This means keeping a copy of all
or most of your mail, separated into spam and ham piles, and
periodically re-training using those. It produces the best
results, but requires more work from you, the user.</p>

<p>(An easy way to do this, by the way, is to create a new
folder for deleted messages, and instead of deleting them
from other folders, simply move them in there instead. Then
keep all spam in a separate folder and never delete it. As
long as you remember to move misclassified mails into the
correct folder set, it is easy enough to keep up to
date.)</p>

<p>2. Unsupervised learning from Bayesian classification
Another way to train is to chain the results of the Bayesian
classifier back into the training, so it reinforces its own
decisions. This is only safe if you then retrain it based on
any errors you discover.</p>

<p>SpamAssassin does not support this method, due to
experimental results which strongly indicate that it does
not work well, and since Bayes is only one part of the
resulting score presented to the user (while Bayes may have
made the wrong decision about a mail, it may have been
overridden by another system).</p>

<p>3. Unsupervised learning from SpamAssassin rules Also
called auto-learning in SpamAssassin. Based on statistical
analysis of the SpamAssassin success rates, we can
automatically train the Bayesian database with a certain
degree of confidence that our training data is accurate.</p>

<p>It should be supplemented with some supervised training
in addition, if possible.</p>

<p>This is the default, but can be turned off by setting
the SpamAssassin configuration parameter
&quot;bayes_auto_learn&quot; to 0.</p>

<p>4. Mistake-based training This means training on a small
number of mails, then only training on messages that
SpamAssassin classifies incorrectly. This works, but it
takes longer to get it right than a full training session
would.</p>

<p>FILES sa-learn and the other parts of SpamAssassins
Bayesian learner, use a set of persistent database files to
store the learnt tokens, as follows.</p>

<p>bayes_toks The database of tokens, containing the tokens
learnt, their count of occurrences in ham and spam, and the
timestamp when the token was last seen in a message.</p>

<p>This database also contains some magic tokens, as
follows: the version number of the database, the number of
ham and spam messages learnt, the number of tokens in the
database, and timestamps of: the last journal sync, the last
expiry run, the last expiry token reduction count, the last
expiry timestamp delta, the oldest token timestamp in the
database, and the newest token timestamp in the
database.</p>

<p>This is a database file, using &quot;DB_File&quot;. The
database version number is 0 for databases from 2.5x, 1 for
databases from certain 2.6x development releases, 2 for
2.6x, and 3 for 3.0 and later releases.</p>

<p>bayes_seen A map of Message-Id and some data from
headers and body to what that message was learnt as. This is
used so that SpamAssassin can avoid re-learning a message it
has already seen, and so it can reverse the training if you
later decide that message was learnt incorrectly.</p>

<p>This is a database file, using &quot;DB_File&quot;.</p>

<p>bayes_journal While SpamAssassin is scanning mails, it
needs to track which tokens it uses in its calculations. To
avoid the contention of having each SpamAssassin process
attempting to gain write access to the Bayes DB, the token
timestamps are written to a journal file which will later
(either automatically or via &quot;sa-learn --sync&quot;) be
used to synchronize the Bayes DB.</p>

<p>Also, through the use of
&quot;bayes_learn_to_journal&quot;, or when using the
&quot;--no-sync&quot; option with sa-learn, the actual
learning data will take be placed into the journal for later
synchronization. This is typically useful for high-traffic
sites to avoid the same contention as stated above.</p>

<p>EXPIRATION Since SpamAssassin can auto-learn messages,
the Bayes database files could increase perpetually until
they fill your disk. To control this, SpamAssassin performs
journal synchronization and bayes expiration periodically
when certain criteria (listed below) are met.</p>

<p>SpamAssassin can sync the journal and expire the DB
tokens either manually or opportunistically. A journal sync
is due if --sync is passed to sa-learn (manual), or if the
following is true (opportunistic):</p>

<p>- bayes_journal_max_size does not equal 0 (means dont
sync) - the journal file exists</p>

<p>and either:</p>

<p>- the journal file has a size greater than
bayes_journal_max_size</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>- a journal sync has previously occurred, and at least 1
day has passed since that sync</p>

<p>Expiry is due if --force-expire is passed to sa-learn
(manual), or if all of the following are true
(opportunistic):</p>

<p>- the last expire was attempted at least 12hrs ago -
bayes_auto_expire does not equal 0 - the number of tokens in
the DB is &gt; 100,000 - the number of tokens in the DB is
&gt; bayes_expiry_max_db_size - there is at least a 12 hr
difference between the oldest and newest token atimes</p>

<p>EXPIRE LOGIC If either the manual or opportunistic
method causes an expire run to start, here is the logic that
is used:</p>

<p>- figure out how many tokens to keep. take the larger of
either bayes_expiry_max_db_size * 75% or 100,000 tokens.
therefore, the goal reduction is number of tokens - number
of tokens to keep. - if the reduction number is &lt; 1000
tokens, abort (not worth the effort). - if an expire has
been done before, guesstimate the new atime delta based on
the old atime delta. (new_atime_delta = old_atime_delta *
old_reduction_count / goal) - if no expire has been done
before, or the last expire looks &quot;weird&quot;, do an
estimation pass. The definition of &quot;weird&quot; is: -
last expire over 30 days ago - last atime delta was &lt; 12
hrs - last reduction count was &lt; 1000 tokens - estimated
new atime delta is &lt; 12 hrs - the difference between the
last reduction count and the goal reduction count is &gt;
50%</p>

<p>ESTIMATION PASS LOGIC Go through each of the DBs tokens.
Starting at 12hrs, calculate whether or not the token would
be expired (based on the difference between the tokens atime
and the dbs newest token atime) and keep the count. Work out
from 12hrs exponentially by powers of 2. ie: 12hrs * 1,
12hrs * 2, 12hrs * 4, 12hrs * 8, and so on, up to 12hrs *
512 (6144hrs, or 256 days).</p>

<p>The larger the delta, the smaller the number of tokens
that will be expired. Conversely, the number of tokens goes
up as the delta gets smaller. So starting at the largest
atime delta, figure out which delta will expire the most
tokens without going above the goal expiration count. Use
this to choose the atime delta to use, unless one of the
following occurs:</p>

<p>- the largest atime (smallest reduction count) would
expire too many tokens. this means the learned tokens are
mostly old and there needs to be new tokens learned before
an expire can occur. - all of the atime choices result in 0
tokens being removed. this means the tokens are all newer
than 12 hours and there needs to be new tokens learned
before an expire can occur. - the number of tokens that
would be removed is &lt; 1000. the benefit isnt worth the
effort. more tokens need to be learned.</p>

<p>If the expire run gets past this point, it will continue
to the end. A new DB is created since the majority of DB
libraries don t shrink the DB file when tokens are removed.
So we do the &quot;create new, migrate old to new, remove
old, rename new&quot; shuffle.</p>

<p>EXPIRY RELATED CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
&quot;bayes_auto_expire&quot; is used to specify whether or
not SpamAssassin ought to opportunistically attempt to
expire the Bayes database. The default is 1 (yes).
&quot;bayes_expiry_max_db_size&quot; specifies both the
auto-expire token count point, as well as the resulting
number of tokens after expiry as described above. The
default value is 150,000, which is roughly equivalent to a
6Mb database file if youre using DB_File.
&quot;bayes_journal_max_size&quot; specifies how large the
Bayes journal will grow before it is opportunistically
synced. The default value is 102400.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION The sa-learn command is part of the
Mail::SpamAssassin Perl module. Install this as a normal
Perl module, using &quot;perl -MCPAN -e shell&quot;, or by
