<p>PAM_LOCALUSER(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_LOCALUSER(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_localuser - require users to be listed in
/etc/passwd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_localuser.so [debug]
[file=/path/passwd]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_localuser is a PAM module to help
implementing site-wide login policies, where they typically
include a subset of the network&acute;s users and a few
accounts that are local to a particular workstation. Using
pam_localuser and pam_wheel or pam_listfile is an effective
way to restrict access to either local users and/or a subset
of the network&acute;s users.</p>

<p>This could also be implemented using pam_listfile.so and
a very short awk script invoked by cron, but it&acute;s
common enough to have been separated out.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>file=/path/passwd Use a file other than /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED All module types (account, auth,
password and session) are provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS The new localuser was set
successfully.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR No username was given.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User not known.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/su to
allow only local users in group wheel to use su.</p>

<p>account sufficient pam_localuser.so account required
pam_wheel.so</p>

<p>FILES /etc/passwd Local user account information.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pam.conf(5), pam.d(5), pam(8)</p>
