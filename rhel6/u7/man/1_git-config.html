--edit</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION You can query/set/replace/unset options with
this command. The name is actually the section and the key
separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped.</p>

<p>Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the
--add option. If you want to update or unset an option which
can occur on multiple lines, a POSIX regexp value_regex
needs to be given. Only the existing values that match the
regexp are updated or unset. If you want to handle the lines
that do not match the regex, just prepend a single
exclamation mark in front (see also the section called
EXAMPLES).</p>

<p>The type specifier can be either --int or --bool, to
make git config ensure that the variable(s) are of the given
type and convert the value to the canonical form (simple
decimal number for int, a &quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot; string for bool), or --path, which does
some path expansion (see --path below). If no type specifier
is passed, no checks or transformations are performed on the
value.</p>

<p>The file-option can be one of --system, --global or
--file which specify where the values will be read from or
written to. The default is to assume the config file of the
current repository, .git/config unless defined otherwise
with GIT_DIR and GIT_CONFIG (see the section called
FILES).</p>

<p>This command will fail if:</p>

<p>1. The config file is invalid,</p>

<p>2. Can not write to the config file,</p>

<p>3. no section was provided,</p>

<p>4. the section or key is invalid,</p>

<p>5. you try to unset an option which does not exist,</p>

<p>6. you try to unset/set an option for which multiple
lines match, or</p>

<p>7. you use --global option without $HOME being properly
set.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --replace-all Default behavior is to replace at
most one line. This replaces all lines matching the key (and
optionally the value_regex).</p>

<p>--add Adds a new line to the option without altering any
existing values. This is the same as providing ^$ as the
value_regex in --replace-all.</p>

<p>--get Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered
by a regex matching the value). Returns error code 1 if the
key was not found and error code 2 if multiple key values
were found.</p>

<p>--get-all Like get, but does not fail if the number of
values for the key is not exactly one.</p>

<p>--get-regexp Like --get-all, but interprets the name as
a regular expression. Also outputs the key names.</p>

<p>--global For writing options: write to global
~/.gitconfig file rather than the repository
.git/config.</p>

<p>For reading options: read only from global ~/.gitconfig
rather than from all available files.</p>

<p>See also the section called FILES.</p>

<p>--system For writing options: write to system-wide
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig rather than the repository
.git/config.</p>

<p>For reading options: read only from system-wide
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig rather than from all available
files.</p>

<p>See also the section called FILES.</p>

<p>-f config-file, --file config-file Use the given config
file instead of the one specified by GIT_CONFIG.</p>

<p>--remove-section Remove the given section from the
configuration file.</p>

<p>--rename-section Rename the given section to a new
name.</p>

<p>--unset Remove the line matching the key from config
file.</p>

<p>--unset-all Remove all lines matching the key from
config file.</p>

<p>-l, --list List all variables set in config file.</p>

<p>--bool</p>

<p>git config will ensure that the output is
&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;</p>

<p>--int</p>

<p>git config will ensure that the output is a simple
decimal number. An optional value suffix of k, m, or g in
the config file will cause the value to be multiplied by
1024, 1048576, or 1073741824 prior to output.</p>

<p>--bool-or-int</p>

<p>git config will ensure that the output matches the
format of either --bool or --int, as described above.</p>

<p>--path</p>

<p>git-config will expand leading ~ to the value of $HOME,
and ~user to the home directory for the specified user. This
option has no effect when setting the value (but you can use
git config bla ~/ from the command line to let your shell do
the expansion).</p>

<p>-z, --null For all options that output values and/or
keys, always end values with the null character (instead of
a newline). Use newline instead as a delimiter between key
and value. This allows for secure parsing of the output
without getting confused e.g. by values that contain line
breaks.</p>

<p>--get-colorbool name [stdout-is-tty] Find the color
setting for name (e.g. color.diff) and output
&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. stdout-is-tty should
be either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, and is
taken into account when configuration says &quot;auto&quot;.
If stdout-is-tty is missing, then checks the standard output
of the command itself, and exits with status 0 if color is
to be used, or exits with status 1 otherwise. When the color
setting for name is undefined, the command uses color.ui as
fallback.</p>

<p>--get-color name [default] Find the color configured for
name (e.g. color.diff.new) and output it as the ANSI color
escape sequence to the standard output. The optional default
parameter is used instead, if there is no color configured
for name.</p>

<p>-e, --edit Opens an editor to modify the specified
config file; either --system, --global, or repository
(default).</p>

<p>FILES If not set explicitly with --file, there are three
files where git config will search for configuration
options:</p>

<p>$GIT_DIR/config Repository specific configuration file.
(The filename is of course relative to the repository root,
not the working directory.)</p>

<p>~/.gitconfig User-specific configuration file. Also
called &quot;global&quot; configuration file.</p>

<p>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig System-wide configuration
file.</p>

<p>If no further options are given, all reading options
will read all of these files that are available. If the
global or the system-wide configuration file are not
available they will be ignored. If the repository
configuration file is not available or readable, git config
will exit with a non-zero error code. However, in neither
case will an error message be issued.</p>

<p>All writing options will per default write to the
repository specific configuration file. Note that this also
affects options like --replace-all and --unset. git config
will only ever change one file at a time.</p>

<p>You can override these rules either by command line
options or by environment variables. The --global and the
--system options will limit the file used to the global or
system-wide file respectively. The GIT_CONFIG environment
variable has a similar effect, but you can specify any
filename you want.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GIT_CONFIG Take the configuration from the
given file instead of .git/config. Using the
&quot;--global&quot; option forces this to ~/.gitconfig.
Using the &quot;--system&quot; option forces this to
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig.</p>

<p>See also the section called FILES.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Given a .git/config like this:</p>

<p># # This is the config file, and # a &acute;#&acute; or
&acute;;&acute; character indicates # a comment #</p>

<p>; core variables [core] ; Don&acute;t trust file modes
filemode = false</p>

<p>; Our diff algorithm [diff] external =
/usr/local/bin/diff-wrapper renames = true</p>

<p>; Proxy settings [core]
gitproxy=&quot;proxy-command&quot; for kernel.org
gitproxy=default-proxy ; for all the rest</p>

<p>you can set the filemode to true with</p>

<p>% git config core.filemode true</p>

<p>The hypothetical proxy command entries actually have a
postfix to discern what URL they apply to. Here is how to
change the entry for kernel.org to &quot;ssh&quot;.</p>

<p>% git config core.gitproxy &acute;&quot;ssh&quot; for
kernel.org&acute; &acute;for kernel.org$&acute;</p>

<p>This makes sure that only the key/value pair for
kernel.org is replaced.</p>

<p>To delete the entry for renames, do</p>

<p>% git config --unset diff.renames</p>

<p>If you want to delete an entry for a multivar (like
core.gitproxy above), you have to provide a regex matching
the value of exactly one line.</p>

<p>To query the value for a given key, do</p>

<p>% git config --get core.filemode</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>% git config core.filemode</p>

<p>or, to query a multivar:</p>

<p>% git config --get core.gitproxy &quot;for
kernel.org$&quot;</p>

<p>If you want to know all the values for a multivar,
do:</p>

<p>% git config --get-all core.gitproxy</p>

<p>If you like to live dangerously, you can replace all
core.gitproxy by a new one with</p>

<p>% git config --replace-all core.gitproxy ssh</p>

<p>However, if you really only want to replace the line for
the default proxy, i.e. the one without a &quot;for
...&quot; postfix, do something like this:</p>

<p>% git config core.gitproxy ssh &acute;! for &acute;</p>

<p>To actually match only values with an exclamation mark,
you have to</p>

<p>% git config section.key value &acute;[!]&acute;</p>

<p>To add a new proxy, without altering any of the existing
ones, use</p>

<p>% git config core.gitproxy
&acute;&quot;proxy-command&quot; for example.com&acute;</p>

<p>An example to use customized color from the
configuration in your script:</p>

<p>#!/bin/sh WS=$(git config --get-color
color.diff.whitespace &quot;blue reverse&quot;) RESET=$(git
config --get-color &quot;&quot; &quot;reset&quot;) echo
&quot;${WS}your whitespace color or blue
reverse${RESET}&quot;</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION FILE The git configuration file contains a
number of variables that affect the git commands behavior.
The .git/config file in each repository is used to store the
configuration for that repository, and $HOME/.gitconfig is
used to store a per-user configuration as fallback values
for the .git/config file. The file /etc/gitconfig can be
used to store a system-wide default configuration.</p>

<p>The configuration variables are used by both the git
plumbing and the porcelains. The variables are divided into
sections, wherein the fully qualified variable name of the
variable itself is the last dot-separated segment and the
section name is everything before the last dot. The variable
names are case-insensitive and only alphanumeric characters
are allowed. Some variables may appear multiple times.</p>

<p>Syntax The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive;
whitespaces are mostly ignored. The # and ; characters begin
comments to the end of line, blank lines are ignored.</p>

<p>The file consists of sections and variables. A section
begins with the name of the section in square brackets and
continues until the next section begins. Section names are
not case sensitive. Only alphanumeric characters, - and .
are allowed in section names. Each variable must belong to
some section, which means that there must be a section
header before the first setting of a variable.</p>

<p>Sections can be further divided into subsections. To
begin a subsection put its name in double quotes, separated
by space from the section name, in the section header, like
in the example below:</p>

<p>[section &quot;subsection&quot;]</p>

<p>Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any
characters except newline (doublequote &quot; and backslash
have to be escaped as and \, respectively). Section headers
cannot span multiple lines. Variables may belong directly to
a section or to a given subsection. You can have [section]
if you have [section &quot;subsection&quot;], but you dont
need to.</p>

<p>There is also a case insensitive alternative
[section.subsection] syntax. In this syntax, subsection
names follow the same restrictions as for section names.</p>

<p>All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after
the section header) are recognized as setting variables, in
the form name = value. If there is no equal sign on the
line, the entire line is taken as name and the variable is
recognized as boolean &quot;true&quot;. The variable names
are case-insensitive and only alphanumeric characters and -
are allowed. There can be more than one value for a given
variable; we say then that variable is multivalued.</p>

<p>Leading and trailing whitespace in a variable value is
discarded. Internal whitespace within a variable value is
retained verbatim.</p>

<p>The values following the equals sign in variable assign
are all either a string, an integer, or a boolean. Boolean
values may be given as yes/no, 0/1, true/false or on/off.
Case is not significant in boolean values, when converting
value to the canonical form using --bool type specifier; git
config will ensure that the output is &quot;true&quot; or
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>String values may be entirely or partially enclosed in
double quotes. You need to enclose variable values in double
quotes if you want to preserve leading or trailing
whitespace, or if the variable value contains comment
characters (i.e. it contains # or ;). Double quote &quot;
and backslash characters in variable values must be escaped:
use for &quot; and \ for .</p>

<p>The following escape sequences (beside for newline
character (NL), for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB) andf
obackspace (BS). No other char escape sequence, nor octal
rchar sequences are valid.</p>

<p>Variable values ending in a are continued on the next
line in the customary UNIX fashion.</p>

<p>Some variables may require a special value format.</p>

<p>Example # Core variables [core] ; Don&acute;t trust file
modes filemode = false</p>

<p># Our diff algorithm [diff] external =
/usr/local/bin/diff-wrapper renames = true</p>

<p>[branch &quot;devel&quot;] remote = origin merge =
refs/heads/devel</p>

<p># Proxy settings [core] gitProxy=&quot;ssh&quot; for
&quot;kernel.org&quot; gitProxy=default-proxy ; for the
rest</p>

<p>Variables Note that this list is non-comprehensive and
not necessarily complete. For command-specific variables,
you will find a more detailed description in the appropriate
manual page. You will find a description of non-core
porcelain configuration variables in the respective
porcelain documentation.</p>

<p>advice.* When set to true, display the given optional
help message. When set to false, do not display. The
configuration variables are:</p>

<p>pushNonFastForward Advice shown when git-push(1) refuses
non-fast-forward refs. Default: true.</p>

<p>statusHints Directions on how to stage/unstage/add shown
in the output of git-status(1) and the template shown when
writing commit messages. Default: true.</p>

<p>commitBeforeMerge Advice shown when git-merge(1) refuses
to merge to avoid overwritting local changes. Default:
true.</p>

<p>resolveConflict Advices shown by various commands when
conflicts prevent the operation from being performed.
Default: true.</p>

<p>implicitIdentity Advice on how to set your identity
configuration when your information is guessed from the
system username and domain name. Default: true.</p>

<p>detachedHead Advice shown when you used :git-checkout(1)
to move to the detach HEAD state, to instruct how to create
a local branch after the fact. Default: true.</p>

<p>core.fileMode If false, the executable bit differences
between the index and the working copy are ignored; useful
on broken filesystems like FAT. See git-update-index(1).</p>

<p>The default is true, except git-clone(1) or git-init(1)
will probe and set core.fileMode false if appropriate when
the repository is created.</p>

<p>core.ignoreCygwinFSTricks This option is only used by
Cygwin implementation of Git. If false, the Cygwin stat()
and lstat() functions are used. This may be useful if your
repository consists of a few separate directories joined in
one hierarchy using Cygwin mount. If true, Git uses native
Win32 API whenever it is possible and falls back to Cygwin
functions only to handle symbol links. The native mode is
more than twice faster than normal Cygwin l/stat()
functions. True by default, unless core.filemode is true, in
which case ignoreCygwinFSTricks is ignored as Cygwin s POSIX
emulation is required to support core.filemode.</p>

<p>core.ignorecase If true, this option enables various
workarounds to enable git to work better on filesystems that
are not case sensitive, like FAT. For example, if a
directory listing finds &quot;makefile&quot; when git
expects &quot;Makefile&quot;, git will assume it is really
the same file, and continue to remember it as
&quot;Makefile&quot;.</p>

<p>The default is false, except git-clone(1) or git-init(1)
will probe and set core.ignorecase true if appropriate when
the repository is created.</p>

<p>core.trustctime If false, the ctime differences between
the index and the working copy are ignored; useful when the
inode change time is regularly modified by something outside
Git (file system crawlers and some backup systems). See
git-update-index(1). True by default.</p>

<p>core.quotepath The commands that output paths (e.g.
ls-files, diff), when not given the -z option, will quote
&quot;unusual&quot; characters in the pathname by enclosing
the pathname in a double-quote pair and with backslashes the
same way strings in C source code are quoted. If this
variable is set to false, the bytes higher than 0x80 are not
quoted but output as verbatim. Note that double quote,
backslash and control characters are always quoted without
-z regardless of the setting of this variable.</p>

<p>core.autocrlf If true, makes git convert CRLF at the end
of lines in text files to LF when reading from the work
tree, and convert in reverse when writing to the work tree.
The variable can be set to input, in which case the
conversion happens only while reading from the work tree but
files are written out to the work tree with LF at the end of
lines. A file is considered &quot;text&quot; (i.e. be
subjected to the autocrlf mechanism) based on the files crlf
attribute, or if crlf is unspecified, based on the file s
contents. See gitattributes(5).</p>

<p>core.safecrlf If true, makes git check if converting
CRLF as controlled by core.autocrlf is reversible. Git will
verify if a command modifies a file in the work tree either
directly or indirectly. For example, committing a file
followed by checking out the same file should yield the
original file in the work tree. If this is not the case for
the current setting of core.autocrlf, git will reject the
file. The variable can be set to &quot;warn&quot;, in which
case git will only warn about an irreversible conversion but
continue the operation.</p>

<p>CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting
data. autocrlf=true will convert CRLF to LF during commit
and LF to CRLF during checkout. A file that contains a
mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated
by git. For text files this is the right thing to do: it
corrects line endings such that we have only LF line endings
in the repository. But for binary files that are
accidentally classified as text the conversion can corrupt
data.</p>

<p>If you recognize such corruption early you can easily
fix it by setting the conversion type explicitly in
.gitattributes. Right after committing you still have the
original file in your work tree and this file is not yet
corrupted. You can explicitly tell git that this file is
binary and git will handle the file appropriately.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text
files with mixed line endings and the undesired effect of
corrupting binary files cannot be distinguished. In both
cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible way. For text
files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line
endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts
data.</p>

<p>Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout
will generate a file identical to the original file for a
different setting of core.autocrlf, but only for the current
one. For example, a text file with LF would be accepted with
core.autocrlf=input and could later be checked out with
core.autocrlf=true, in which case the resulting file would
contain CRLF, although the original file contained LF.
However, in both work trees the line endings would be
consistent, that is either all LF or all CRLF, but never
mixed. A file with mixed line endings would be reported by
the core.safecrlf mechanism.</p>

<p>core.symlinks If false, symbolic links are checked out
as small plain files that contain the link text.
git-update-index(1) and git-add(1) will not change the
recorded type to regular file. Useful on filesystems like
FAT that do not support symbolic links.</p>

<p>The default is true, except git-clone(1) or git-init(1)
will probe and set core.symlinks false if appropriate when
the repository is created.</p>

<p>core.gitProxy A &quot;proxy command&quot; to execute (as
command host port) instead of establishing direct connection
to the remote server when using the git protocol for
fetching. If the variable value is in the &quot;COMMAND for
DOMAIN&quot; format, the command is applied only on
hostnames ending with the specified domain string. This
variable may be set multiple times and is matched in the
given order; the first match wins.</p>

<p>Can be overridden by the GIT_PROXY_COMMAND environment
variable (which always applies universally, without the
special &quot;for&quot; handling).</p>

<p>The special string none can be used as the proxy command
to specify that no proxy be used for a given domain pattern.
This is useful for excluding servers inside a firewall from
proxy use, while defaulting to a common proxy for external
domains.</p>

<p>core.ignoreStat If true, commands which modify both the
working tree and the index will mark the updated paths with
the &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit in the index. These
marked files are then assumed to stay unchanged in the
working copy, until you mark them otherwise manually - Git
will not detect the file changes by lstat() calls. This is
useful on systems where those are very slow, such as
Microsoft Windows. See git- update-index(1). False by
default.</p>

<p>core.preferSymlinkRefs Instead of the default
&quot;symref&quot; format for HEAD and other symbolic
reference files, use symbolic links. This is sometimes
needed to work with old scripts that expect HEAD to be a
symbolic link.</p>

<p>core.bare If true this repository is assumed to be bare
and has no working directory associated with it. If this is
the case a number of commands that require a working
directory will be disabled, such as git-add(1) or
git-merge(1).</p>

<p>This setting is automatically guessed by git-clone(1) or
git- init(1) when the repository was created. By default a
repository that ends in &quot;/.git&quot; is assumed to be
not bare (bare = false), while all other repositories are
assumed to be bare (bare = true).</p>

<p>core.worktree Set the path to the root of the work tree.
This can be overridden by the GIT_WORK_TREE environment
variable and the --work-tree command line option. It can be
an absolute path or a relative path to the .git directory,
either specified by --git-dir or GIT_DIR, or automatically
discovered. If --git-dir or GIT_DIR are specified but none
of --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and core.worktree is
specified, the current working directory is regarded as the
root of the work tree.</p>

<p>Note that this variable is honored even when set in a
configuration file in a &quot;.git&quot; subdirectory of a
directory, and its value differs from the latter directory
(e.g. &quot;/path/to/.git/config&quot; has core.worktree set
to &quot;/different/path&quot;), which is most likely a
misconfiguration. Running git commands in
&quot;/path/to&quot; directory will still use
&quot;/different/path&quot; as the root of the work tree and
can cause great confusion to the users.</p>

<p>core.logAllRefUpdates Enable the reflog. Updates to a
ref &lt;ref&gt; is logged to the file
&quot;$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;&quot;, by appending the new
and old SHA1, the date/time and the reason of the update,
but only when the file exists. If this configuration
variable is set to true, missing
&quot;$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;&quot; file is automatically
created for branch heads.</p>

<p>This information can be used to determine what commit
was the tip of a branch &quot;2 days ago&quot;.</p>

<p>This value is true by default in a repository that has a
working directory associated with it, and false by default
in a bare repository.</p>

<p>core.repositoryFormatVersion Internal variable
identifying the repository format and layout version.</p>

<p>core.sharedRepository When group (or true), the
repository is made shareable between several users in a
group (making sure all the files and objects are
group-writable). When all (or world or everybody), the
repository will be readable by all users, additionally to
being group-shareable. When umask (or false), git will use
permissions reported by umask(2). When 0xxx, where 0xxx is
an octal number, files in the repository will have this mode
value. 0xxx will override users umask value (whereas the
other options will only override requested parts of the user
s umask value). Examples: 0660 will make the repo
read/write-able for the owner and group, but inaccessible to
others (equivalent to group unless umask is e.g. 0022). 0640
is a repository that is group-readable but not
group-writable. See git-init(1). False by default.</p>

<p>core.warnAmbiguousRefs If true, git will warn you if the
ref name you passed it is ambiguous and might match multiple
refs in the .git/refs/ tree. True by default.</p>

<p>core.compression An integer -1..9, indicating a default
compression level. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9
being slowest. If set, this provides a default to other
compression variables, such as core.loosecompression and
pack.compression.</p>

<p>core.loosecompression An integer -1..9, indicating the
compression level for objects that are not in a pack file.
-1 is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are
various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set,
defaults to core.compression. If that is not set, defaults
to 1 (best speed).</p>

<p>core.packedGitWindowSize Number of bytes of a pack file
to map into memory in a single mapping operation. Larger
window sizes may allow your system to process a smaller
number of large pack files more quickly. Smaller window
sizes will negatively affect performance due to increased
calls to the operating systems memory manager, but may
improve performance when accessing a large number of large
pack files.</p>

<p>Default is 1 MiB if NO_MMAP was set at compile time,
otherwise 32 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 1 GiB on 64 bit
platforms. This should be reasonable for all users/operating
systems. You probably do not need to adjust this value.</p>

<p>Common unit suffixes of k, m, or g are supported.</p>

<p>core.packedGitLimit Maximum number of bytes to map
simultaneously into memory from pack files. If Git needs to
access more than this many bytes at once to complete an
operation it will unmap existing regions to reclaim virtual
address space within the process.</p>

<p>Default is 256 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 8 GiB on 64
bit platforms. This should be reasonable for all
users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You
probably do not need to adjust this value.</p>

<p>Common unit suffixes of k, m, or g are supported.</p>

<p>core.deltaBaseCacheLimit Maximum number of bytes to
reserve for caching base objects that multiple deltafied
objects reference. By storing the entire decompressed base
objects in a cache Git is able to avoid unpacking and
decompressing frequently used base objects multiple
times.</p>

<p>Default is 16 MiB on all platforms. This should be
reasonable for all users/operating systems, except on the
largest projects. You probably do not need to adjust this
value.</p>

<p>Common unit suffixes of k, m, or g are supported.</p>

<p>core.bigFileThreshold Files larger than this size are
stored deflated, without attempting delta compression.
Storing large files without delta compression avoids
excessive memory usage, at the slight expense of increased
disk usage.</p>

<p>Default is 512 MiB on all platforms. This should be
reasonable for most projects as source code and other text
files can still be delta compressed, but larger binary media
files wont be.</p>

<p>Common unit suffixes of k, m, or g are supported.</p>

<p>Currently only git-fast-import(1) honors this
setting.</p>

<p>core.excludesfile In addition to .gitignore
(per-directory) and .git/info/exclude, git looks into this
file for patterns of files which are not meant to be
tracked. &quot;~/&quot; is expanded to the value of $HOME
and &quot;~user/&quot; to the specified user s home
directory. See gitignore(5).</p>

<p>core.editor Commands such as commit and tag that lets
you edit messages by launching an editor uses the value of
this variable when it is set, and the environment variable
GIT_EDITOR is not set. See git-var(1).</p>

<p>core.pager The command that git will use to paginate
output. Can be overridden with the GIT_PAGER environment
variable. Note that git sets the LESS environment variable
to FRSX if it is unset when it runs the pager. One can
change these settings by setting the LESS variable to some
other value. Alternately, these settings can be overridden
on a project or global basis by setting the core.pager
option. Setting core.pager has no affect on the LESS
environment variable behaviour above, so if you want to
override gits default settings this way, you need to be
explicit. For example, to disable the S option in a backward
compatible manner, set core.pager to less -+$LESS -FRX. This
will be passed to the shell by git, which will translate the
final command to LESS=FRSX less -+FRSX -FRX.</p>

<p>core.whitespace A comma separated list of common
whitespace problems to notice. git diff will use
color.diff.whitespace to highlight them, and git apply
--whitespace=error will consider them as errors. You can
prefix - to disable any of them (e.g. -trailing-space):</p>

<p>&middot; blank-at-eol treats trailing whitespaces at the
end of the line as an error (enabled by default).</p>

<p>&middot; space-before-tab treats a space character that
appears immediately before a tab character in the initial
indent part of the line as an error (enabled by
default).</p>

<p>&middot; indent-with-non-tab treats a line that is
indented with 8 or more space characters as an error (not
enabled by default).</p>

<p>&middot; blank-at-eof treats blank lines added at the
end of file as an error (enabled by default).</p>

<p>&middot; trailing-space is a short-hand to cover both
blank-at-eol and blank-at-eof.</p>

<p>&middot; cr-at-eol treats a carriage-return at the end
of line as part of the line terminator, i.e. with it,
trailing-space does not trigger if the character before such
a carriage-return is not a whitespace (not enabled by
default).</p>

<p>core.fsyncobjectfiles This boolean will enable fsync()
when writing object files.</p>

<p>This is a total waste of time and effort on a filesystem
that orders data writes properly, but can be useful for
filesystems that do not use journalling (traditional UNIX
filesystems) or that only journal metadata and not file
contents (OS Xs HFS+, or Linux ext3 with
&quot;data=writeback&quot;).</p>

<p>core.preloadindex Enable parallel index preload for
operations like git diff</p>

<p>This can speed up operations like git diff and git
status especially on filesystems like NFS that have weak
caching semantics and thus relatively high IO latencies.
With this set to true, git will do the index comparison to
the filesystem data in parallel, allowing overlapping
IOs.</p>

<p>core.createObject You can set this to link, in which
case a hardlink followed by a delete of the source are used
to make sure that object creation will not overwrite
existing objects.</p>

<p>On some file system/operating system combinations, this
is unreliable. Set this config setting to rename there;
However, This will remove the check that makes sure that
existing object files will not get overwritten.</p>

<p>core.notesRef When showing commit messages, also show
notes which are stored in the given ref. This ref is
expected to contain files named after the full SHA-1 of the
commit they annotate. The ref must be fully qualified.</p>

<p>If such a file exists in the given ref, the referenced
blob is read, and appended to the commit message, separated
by a &quot;Notes (&lt;refname&gt;):&quot; line (shortened to
&quot;Notes:&quot; in the case of
&quot;refs/notes/commits&quot;). If the given ref itself
does not exist, it is not an error, but means that no notes
should be printed.</p>

<p>This setting defaults to &quot;refs/notes/commits&quot;,
and can be overridden by the GIT_NOTES_REF environment
variable.</p>

<p>core.sparseCheckout Enable &quot;sparse checkout&quot;
feature. See section &quot;Sparse checkout&quot; in
git-read-tree(1) for more information.</p>

<p>add.ignore-errors Tells git add to continue adding files
when some files cannot be added due to indexing errors.
Equivalent to the --ignore-errors option of git-add(1).</p>

<p>alias.* Command aliases for the git(1) command wrapper -
e.g. after defining &quot;alias.last = cat-file commit
HEAD&quot;, the invocation &quot;git last&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;git cat-file commit HEAD&quot;. To avoid
confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that hide
existing git commands are ignored. Arguments are split by
spaces, the usual shell quoting and escaping is supported.
quote pair and a backslash can be used to quote them.</p>

<p>If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation
point, it will be treated as a shell command. For example,
defining &quot;alias.new = !gitk --all --not
ORIG_HEAD&quot;, the invocation &quot;git new&quot; is
equivalent to running the shell command &quot;gitk --all
--not ORIG_HEAD&quot;. Note that shell commands will be
executed from the top-level directory of a repository, which
may not necessarily be the current directory.</p>

<p>am.keepcr If true, git-am will call git-mailsplit for
patches in mbox format with parameter --keep-cr. In this
case git-mailsplit will not 0 Can be overrriden by from
lines ending with remove giving --no-keep-cr from the
command line. See git-am(1), git- mailsplit(1).</p>

<p>apply.ignorewhitespace When set to change, tells git
apply to ignore changes in whitespace, in the same way as
the --ignore-space-change option. When set to one of: no,
none, never, false tells git apply to respect all whitespace
differences. See git-apply(1).</p>

<p>apply.whitespace Tells git apply how to handle
whitespaces, in the same way as the --whitespace option. See
git-apply(1).</p>

<p>branch.autosetupmerge Tells git branch and git checkout
to set up new branches so that git-pull(1) will
appropriately merge from the starting point branch. Note
that even if this option is not set, this behavior can be
chosen per-branch using the --track and --no-track options.
The valid settings are: false no automatic setup is done;
true automatic setup is done when the starting point is a
remote branch; always automatic setup is done when the
starting point is either a local branch or remote branch.
This option defaults to true.</p>

<p>branch.autosetuprebase When a new branch is created with
git branch or git checkout that tracks another branch, this
variable tells git to set up pull to rebase instead of merge
(see &quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase&quot;). When never,
rebase is never automatically set to true. When local,
rebase is set to true for tracked branches of other local
branches. When remote, rebase is set to true for tracked
branches of remote branches. When always, rebase will be set
to true for all tracking branches. See
&quot;branch.autosetupmerge&quot; for details on how to set
up a branch to track another branch. This option defaults to
never.</p>

<p>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote When in branch &lt;name&gt;,
it tells git fetch and git push which remote to fetch
from/push to. It defaults to origin if no remote is
configured. origin is also used if you are not on any
branch.</p>

<p>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge Defines, together with
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, the upstream branch for the
given branch. It tells git fetch/git pull which branch to
merge and can also affect git push (see push.default). When
in branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells git fetch the default
refspec to be marked for merging in FETCH_HEAD. The value is
handled like the remote part of a refspec, and must match a
ref which is fetched from the remote given by
&quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote&quot;. The merge
information is used by git pull (which at first calls git
fetch) to lookup the default branch for merging. Without
this option, git pull defaults to merge the first refspec
fetched. Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge. If
you wish to setup git pull so that it merges into
&lt;name&gt; from another branch in the local repository,
you can point branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge to the desired
branch, and use the special setting . (a period) for
branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote.</p>

<p>branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeoptions Sets default options
for merging into branch &lt;name&gt;. The syntax and
supported options are the same as those of git-merge(1), but
option values containing whitespace characters are currently
not supported.</p>

<p>branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase When true, rebase the branch
&lt;name&gt; on top of the fetched branch, instead of
merging the default branch from the default remote when
&quot;git pull&quot; is run. NOTE: this is a possibly
dangerous operation; do not use it unless you understand the
implications (see git- rebase(1) for details).</p>

<p>browser.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd Specify the command to invoke
the specified browser. The specified command is evaluated in
shell with the URLs passed as arguments. (See
git-webrowse(1).)</p>

<p>browser.&lt;tool&gt;.path Override the path for the
given tool that may be used to browse HTML help (see -w
option in git-help(1)) or a working repository in gitweb
(see git-instaweb(1)).</p>

<p>clean.requireForce A boolean to make git-clean do
nothing unless given -f or -n. Defaults to true.</p>

<p>color.branch A boolean to enable/disable color in the
output of git-branch(1). May be set to always, false (or
never) or auto (or true), in which case colors are used only
when the output is to a terminal. Defaults to false.</p>

<p>color.branch.&lt;slot&gt; Use customized color for
branch coloration. &lt;slot&gt; is one of current (the
current branch), local (a local branch), remote (a tracking
branch in refs/remotes/), plain (other refs).</p>

<p>The value for these configuration variables is a list of
colors (at most two) and attributes (at most one), separated
by spaces. The colors accepted are normal, black, red,
green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white; the attributes
are bold, dim, ul, blink and reverse. The first color given
is the foreground; the second is the background. The
position of the attribute, if any, doesnt matter.</p>

<p>color.diff When set to always, always use colors in
patch. When false (or never), never. When set to true or
auto, use colors only when the output is to the terminal.
Defaults to false.</p>

<p>color.diff.&lt;slot&gt; Use customized color for diff
colorization. &lt;slot&gt; specifies which part of the patch
to use the specified color, and is one of plain (context
text), meta (metainformation), frag (hunk header), func
(function in hunk header), old (removed lines), new (added
lines), commit (commit headers), or whitespace (highlighting
whitespace errors). The values of these variables may be
specified as in color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;.</p>

<p>color.grep When set to always, always highlight matches.
When false (or never), never. When set to true or auto, use
color only when the output is written to the terminal.
Defaults to false.</p>

<p>color.grep.&lt;slot&gt; Use customized color for grep
colorization. &lt;slot&gt; specifies which part of the line
to use the specified color, and is one of</p>

<p>context non-matching text in context lines (when using
-A, -B, or -C)</p>

<p>filename filename prefix (when not using -h)</p>

<p>function function name lines (when using -p)</p>

<p>linenumber line number prefix (when using -n)</p>

<p>match matching text</p>

<p>selected non-matching text in selected lines</p>

<p>separator separators between fields on a line (:, -, and
=) and between hunks (--)</p>

<p>The values of these variables may be specified as in
color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;.</p>

<p>color.interactive When set to always, always use colors
for interactive prompts and displays (such as those used by
&quot;git-add --interactive&quot;). When false (or never),
never. When set to true or auto, use colors only when the
output is to the terminal. Defaults to false.</p>

<p>color.interactive.&lt;slot&gt; Use customized color for
git add --interactive output. &lt;slot&gt; may be prompt,
header, help or error, for four distinct types of normal
output from interactive commands. The values of these
variables may be specified as in
color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;.</p>

<p>color.pager A boolean to enable/disable colored output
when the pager is in use (default is true).</p>

<p>color.showbranch A boolean to enable/disable color in
the output of git-show- branch(1). May be set to always,
false (or never) or auto (or true), in which case colors are
used only when the output is to a terminal. Defaults to
false.</p>

<p>color.status A boolean to enable/disable color in the
output of git-status(1). May be set to always, false (or
never) or auto (or true), in which case colors are used only
when the output is to a terminal. Defaults to false.</p>

<p>color.status.&lt;slot&gt; Use customized color for
status colorization. &lt;slot&gt; is one of header (the
header text of the status message), added or updated (files
which are added but not committed), changed (files which are
changed but not added in the index), untracked (files which
are not tracked by git), or nobranch (the color the no
branch warning is shown in, defaulting to red). The values
of these variables may be specified as in
color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;.</p>

<p>color.ui When set to always, always use colors in all
git commands which are capable of colored output. When false
(or never), never. When set to true or auto, use colors only
when the output is to the terminal. When more specific
variables of color.* are set, they always take precedence
over this setting. Defaults to false.</p>

<p>commit.status A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of
status information in the commit message template when using
an editor to prepare the commit message. Defaults to
true.</p>

<p>commit.template Specify a file to use as the template
for new commit messages. &quot;~/&quot; is expanded to the
value of $HOME and &quot;~user/&quot; to the specified users
home directory.</p>

<p>diff.autorefreshindex When using git diff to compare
with work tree files, do not consider stat-only change as
changed. Instead, silently run git update-index --refresh to
update the cached stat information for paths whose contents
in the work tree match the contents in the index. This
option defaults to true. Note that this affects only git
diff Porcelain, and not lower level diff commands such as
git diff-files.</p>

<p>diff.external If this config variable is set, diff
generation is not performed using the internal diff
machinery, but using the given command. Can be overridden
with the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable. The command
is called with parameters as described under &quot;git
Diffs&quot; in git(1). Note: if you want to use an external
diff program only on a subset of your files, you might want
to use gitattributes(5) instead.</p>

<p>diff.mnemonicprefix If set, git diff uses a prefix pair
that is different from the standard &quot;a/&quot; and
&quot;b/&quot; depending on what is being compared. When
this configuration is in effect, reverse diff output also
swaps the order of the prefixes:</p>

<p>git diff compares the (i)ndex and the (w)ork tree;</p>

<p>git diff HEAD compares a (c)ommit and the (w)ork
tree;</p>

<p>git diff --cached compares a (c)ommit and the
(i)ndex;</p>

<p>git diff HEAD:file1 file2 compares an (o)bject and a
(w)ork tree entity;</p>

<p>git diff --no-index a b compares two non-git things (1)
and (2).</p>

<p>diff.renameLimit The number of files to consider when
performing the copy/rename detection; equivalent to the git
diff option -l.</p>

<p>diff.renames Tells git to detect renames. If set to any
boolean value, it will enable basic rename detection. If set
to &quot;copies&quot; or &quot;copy&quot;, it will detect
copies, as well.</p>

<p>diff.suppressBlankEmpty A boolean to inhibit the
standard behavior of printing a space before each empty
output line. Defaults to false.</p>

<p>diff.tool Controls which diff tool is used. diff.tool
overrides merge.tool when used by git-difftool(1) and has
the same valid values as merge.tool minus
&quot;tortoisemerge&quot; and plus &quot;kompare&quot;.</p>

<p>difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.path Override the path for the
given tool. This is useful in case your tool is not in the
PATH.</p>

<p>difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd Specify the command to invoke
the specified diff tool. The specified command is evaluated
in shell with the following variables available: LOCAL is
set to the name of the temporary file containing the
contents of the diff pre-image and REMOTE is set to the name
of the temporary file containing the contents of the diff
post-image.</p>

<p>difftool.prompt Prompt before each invocation of the
diff tool.</p>

<p>diff.wordRegex A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used
to determine what is a &quot;word&quot; when performing
word-by-word difference calculations. Character sequences
that match the regular expression are &quot;words&quot;, all
other characters are ignorable whitespace.</p>

<p>fetch.unpackLimit If the number of objects fetched over
the git native transfer is below this limit, then the
objects will be unpacked into loose object files. However if
the number of received objects equals or exceeds this limit
then the received pack will be stored as a pack, after
adding any missing delta bases. Storing the pack from a push
can make the push operation complete faster, especially on
slow filesystems. If not set, the value of
transfer.unpackLimit is used instead.</p>

<p>format.attach Enable multipart/mixed attachments as the
default for format-patch. The value can also be a double
quoted string which will enable attachments as the default
and set the value as the boundary. See the --attach option
in git-format-patch(1).</p>

<p>format.numbered A boolean which can enable or disable
sequence numbers in patch subjects. It defaults to
&quot;auto&quot; which enables it only if there is more than
one patch. It can be enabled or disabled for all messages by
setting it to &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. See
--numbered option in git- format-patch(1).</p>

<p>format.headers Additional email headers to include in a
patch to be submitted by mail. See git-format-patch(1).</p>

<p>format.cc Additional &quot;Cc:&quot; headers to include
in a patch to be submitted by mail. See the --cc option in
git-format-patch(1).</p>

<p>format.subjectprefix The default for format-patch is to
output files with the [PATCH] subject prefix. Use this
variable to change that prefix.</p>

<p>format.suffix The default for format-patch is to output
files with the suffix .patch. Use this variable to change
that suffix (make sure to include the dot if you want
it).</p>

<p>format.pretty The default pretty format for
log/show/whatchanged command, See git-log(1), git-show(1),
git-whatchanged(1).</p>

<p>format.thread The default threading style for git
format-patch. Can be a boolean value, or shallow or deep.
shallow threading makes every mail a reply to the head of
the series, where the head is chosen from the cover letter,
the --in-reply-to, and the first patch mail, in this order.
deep threading makes every mail a reply to the previous one.
A true boolean value is the same as shallow, and a false
value disables threading.</p>

<p>format.signoff A boolean value which lets you enable the
-s/--signoff option of format-patch by default. Note: Adding
the Signed-off-by: line to a patch should be a conscious act
and means that you certify you have the rights to submit
this work under the same open source license. Please see the
SubmittingPatches document for further discussion.</p>

<p>gc.aggressiveWindow The window size parameter used in
the delta compression algorithm used by git gc --aggressive.
This defaults to 250.</p>

<p>gc.auto When there are approximately more than this many
loose objects in the repository, git gc --auto will pack
them. Some Porcelain commands use this command to perform a
light-weight garbage collection from time to time. The
default value is 6700. Setting this to 0 disables it.</p>

<p>gc.autopacklimit When there are more than this many
packs that are not marked with *.keep file in the
repository, git gc --auto consolidates them into one larger
pack. The default value is 50. Setting this to 0 disables
it.</p>

<p>gc.packrefs Running git pack-refs in a repository
renders it unclonable by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over
dumb transports such as HTTP. This variable determines
whether git gc runs git pack-refs. This can be set to nobare
to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be set to a
boolean value. The default is true.</p>

<p>gc.pruneexpire When git gc is run, it will call prune
--expire 2.weeks.ago. Override the grace period with this
config variable. The value &quot;now&quot; may be used to
disable this grace period and always prune unreachable
objects immediately.</p>

<p>gc.reflogexpire</p>

<p>git reflog expire removes reflog entries older than this
time; defaults to 90 days.</p>

<p>gc.reflogexpireunreachable</p>

<p>git reflog expire removes reflog entries older than this
time and are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to
30 days.</p>

<p>gc.rerereresolved Records of conflicted merge you
resolved earlier are kept for this many days when git rerere
gc is run. The default is 60 days. See git-rerere(1).</p>

<p>gc.rerereunresolved Records of conflicted merge you have
not resolved are kept for this many days when git rerere gc
is run. The default is 15 days. See git-rerere(1).</p>

<p>gitcvs.commitmsgannotation Append this string to each
commit message. Set to empty string to disable this feature.
Defaults to &quot;via git-CVS emulator&quot;.</p>

<p>gitcvs.enabled Whether the CVS server interface is
enabled for this repository. See git-cvsserver(1).</p>

<p>gitcvs.logfile Path to a log file where the CVS server
interface well... logs various stuff. See
git-cvsserver(1).</p>

<p>gitcvs.usecrlfattr If true, the server will look up the
crlf attribute for files to determine the -k modes to use.
If crlf is set, the -k mode will be left blank, so cvs
clients will treat it as text. If crlf is explicitly unset,
the file will be set with -kb mode, which suppresses any
newline munging the client might otherwise do. If crlf is
not specified, then gitcvs.allbinary is used. See
gitattributes(5).</p>

<p>gitcvs.allbinary This is used if gitcvs.usecrlfattr does
not resolve the correct -kb mode to use. If true, all
unresolved files are sent to the client in mode -kb. This
causes the client to treat them as binary files, which
suppresses any newline munging it otherwise might do.
Alternatively, if it is set to &quot;guess&quot;, then the
contents of the file are examined to decide if it is binary,
similar to core.autocrlf.</p>

<p>gitcvs.dbname Database used by git-cvsserver to cache
revision information derived from the git repository. The
exact meaning depends on the used database driver, for
SQLite (which is the default driver) this is a filename.
Supports variable substitution (see git-cvsserver(1) for
details). May not contain semicolons (;). Default:
%Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite</p>

<p>gitcvs.dbdriver Used Perl DBI driver. You can specify
any available driver for this here, but it might not work.
git-cvsserver is tested with DBD::SQLite, reported to work
with DBD::Pg, and reported not to work with DBD::mysql.
Experimental feature. May not contain double colons (:).
Default: SQLite. See git-cvsserver(1).</p>

<p>gitcvs.dbuser, gitcvs.dbpass Database user and password.
Only useful if setting gitcvs.dbdriver, since SQLite has no
concept of database users and/or passwords. gitcvs.dbuser
supports variable substitution (see git-cvsserver(1) for
details).</p>

<p>gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix Database table name prefix.
Prepended to the names of any database tables used, allowing
a single database to be used for several repositories.
Supports variable substitution (see git-cvsserver(1) for
details). Any non-alphabetic characters will be replaced
with underscores.</p>

<p>All gitcvs variables except for gitcvs.usecrlfattr and
gitcvs.allbinary can also be specified as
gitcvs.&lt;access_method&gt;.&lt;varname&gt; (where
access_method is one of &quot;ext&quot; and
&quot;pserver&quot;) to make them apply only for the given
access method.</p>

<p>gui.commitmsgwidth Defines how wide the commit message
window is in the git-gui(1). &quot;75&quot; is the
default.</p>

<p>gui.diffcontext Specifies how many context lines should
be used in calls to diff made by the git-gui(1). The default
is &quot;5&quot;.</p>

<p>gui.encoding Specifies the default encoding to use for
displaying of file contents in git-gui(1) and gitk(1). It
can be overridden by setting the encoding attribute for
relevant files (see gitattributes(5)). If this option is not
set, the tools default to the locale encoding.</p>

<p>gui.matchtrackingbranch Determines if new branches
created with git-gui(1) should default to tracking remote
branches with matching names or not. Default:
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>gui.newbranchtemplate Is used as suggested name when
creating new branches using the git- gui(1).</p>

<p>gui.pruneduringfetch &quot;true&quot; if git-gui(1)
should prune tracking branches when performing a fetch. The
default value is &quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>gui.trustmtime Determines if git-gui(1) should trust the
file modification timestamp or not. By default the
timestamps are not trusted.</p>

<p>gui.spellingdictionary Specifies the dictionary used for
spell checking commit messages in the git-gui(1). When set
to &quot;none&quot; spell checking is turned off.</p>

<p>gui.fastcopyblame If true, git gui blame uses -C instead
of -C -C for original location detection. It makes blame
significantly faster on huge repositories at the expense of
less thorough copy detection.</p>

<p>gui.copyblamethreshold Specifies the threshold to use in
git gui blame original location detection, measured in
alphanumeric characters. See the git- blame(1) manual for
more information on copy detection.</p>

<p>gui.blamehistoryctx Specifies the radius of history
context in days to show in gitk(1) for the selected commit,
when the Show History Context menu item is invoked from git
gui blame. If this variable is set to zero, the whole
history is shown.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.cmd Specifies the shell command
line to execute when the corresponding item of the
git-gui(1) Tools menu is invoked. This option is mandatory
for every tool. The command is executed from the root of the
working directory, and in the environment it receives the
name of the tool as GIT_GUITOOL, the name of the currently
selected file as FILENAME, and the name of the current
branch as CUR_BRANCH (if the head is detached, CUR_BRANCH is
empty).</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.needsfile Run the tool only if a
diff is selected in the GUI. It guarantees that FILENAME is
not empty.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noconsole Run the command silently,
without creating a window to display its output.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.norescan Dont rescan the working
directory for changes after the tool finishes execution.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.confirm Show a confirmation dialog
before actually running the tool.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.argprompt Request a string argument
from the user, and pass it to the tool through the ARGS
environment variable. Since requesting an argument implies
confirmation, the confirm option has no effect if this is
enabled. If the option is set to true, yes, or 1, the dialog
uses a built-in generic prompt; otherwise the exact value of
the variable is used.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revprompt Request a single valid
revision from the user, and set the REVISION environment
variable. In other aspects this option is similar to
argprompt, and can be used together with it.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revunmerged Show only unmerged
branches in the revprompt subdialog. This is useful for
tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for things like
checkout or reset.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.title Specifies the title to use
for the prompt dialog. The default is the tool name.</p>

<p>guitool.&lt;name&gt;.prompt Specifies the general prompt
string to display at the top of the dialog, before
subsections for argprompt and revprompt. The default value
includes the actual command.</p>

<p>help.browser Specify the browser that will be used to
display help in the web format. See git-help(1).</p>

<p>help.format Override the default help format used by
git-help(1). Values man, info, web and html are supported.
man is the default. web and html are the same.</p>

<p>help.autocorrect Automatically correct and execute
mistyped commands after waiting for the given number of
deciseconds (0.1 sec). If more than one command can be
deduced from the entered text, nothing will be executed. If
the value of this option is negative, the corrected command
will be executed immediately. If the value is 0 - the
command will be just shown but not executed. This is the
default.</p>

<p>http.proxy Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured
using the http_proxy environment variable (see curl(1)).
This can be overridden on a per-remote basis; see
remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</p>

<p>http.sslVerify Whether to verify the SSL certificate
when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by
the GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY environment variable.</p>

<p>http.sslCert File containing the SSL certificate when
fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
GIT_SSL_CERT environment variable.</p>

<p>http.sslKey File containing the SSL private key when
fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
GIT_SSL_KEY environment variable.</p>

<p>http.sslCertPasswordProtected Enable git s password
prompt for the SSL certificate. Otherwise OpenSSL will
prompt the user, possibly many times, if the certificate or
private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED environment variable.</p>

<p>http.sslCAInfo File containing the certificates to
verify the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAINFO environment
variable.</p>

<p>http.sslCAPath Path containing files with the CA
certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or
pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAPATH
environment variable.</p>

<p>http.maxRequests How many HTTP requests to launch in
parallel. Can be overridden by the GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS
environment variable. Default is 5.</p>

<p>http.minSessions The number of curl sessions (counted
across slots) to be kept across requests. They will not be
ended with curl_easy_cleanup() until http_cleanup() is
invoked. If USE_CURL_MULTI is not defined, this value will
be capped at 1. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p>http.postBuffer Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used
by smart HTTP transports when POSTing data to the remote
system. For requests larger than this buffer size, HTTP/1.1
and Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to avoid creating a
massive pack file locally. Default is 1 MiB, which is
sufficient for most requests.</p>

<p>http.lowSpeedLimit, http.lowSpeedTime If the HTTP
transfer speed is less than http.lowSpeedLimit for longer
than http.lowSpeedTime seconds, the transfer is aborted. Can
be overridden by the GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT and
GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME environment variables.</p>

<p>http.noEPSV A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp
command by curl. This can helpful with some &quot;poor&quot;
ftp servers which dont support EPSV mode. Can be overridden
by the GIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV environment variable. Default is
false (curl will use EPSV).</p>

<p>i18n.commitEncoding Character encoding the commit
messages are stored in; git itself does not care per se, but
this information is necessary e.g. when importing commits
from emails or in the gitk graphical history browser (and
possibly at other places in the future or in other
porcelains). See e.g. git-mailinfo(1). Defaults to
utf-8.</p>

<p>i18n.logOutputEncoding Character encoding the commit
messages are converted to when running git log and
friends.</p>

<p>imap The configuration variables in the imap section are
described in git-imap-send(1).</p>

<p>init.templatedir Specify the directory from which
templates will be copied. (See the &quot;TEMPLATE
DIRECTORY&quot; section of git-init(1).)</p>

<p>instaweb.browser Specify the program that will be used
to browse your working repository in gitweb. See
git-instaweb(1).</p>

<p>instaweb.httpd The HTTP daemon command-line to start
gitweb on your working repository. See git-instaweb(1).</p>

<p>instaweb.local If true the web server started by
git-instaweb(1) will be bound to the local IP
(127.0.0.1).</p>

<p>instaweb.modulepath The module path for an apache httpd
used by git-instaweb(1).</p>

<p>instaweb.port The port number to bind the gitweb httpd
to. See git-instaweb(1).</p>

<p>interactive.singlekey In interactive commands, allow the
user to provide one-letter input with a single key (i.e.,
without hitting enter). Currently this is used only by the
--patch mode of git-add(1). Note that this setting is
silently ignored if portable keystroke input is not
available.</p>

<p>log.date Set default date-time mode for the log command.
Setting log.date value is similar to using git log&acute;s
--date option. The value is one of the following
alternatives: {relative,local,default,iso,rfc,short}. See
git-log(1).</p>

<p>log.showroot If true, the initial commit will be shown
as a big creation event. This is equivalent to a diff
against an empty tree. Tools like git- log(1) or
git-whatchanged(1), which normally hide the root commit will
now show it. True by default.</p>

<p>mailmap.file The location of an augmenting mailmap file.
The default mailmap, located in the root of the repository,
is loaded first, then the mailmap file pointed to by this
variable. The location of the mailmap file may be in a
repository subdirectory, or somewhere outside of the
repository itself. See git-shortlog(1) and git-
blame(1).</p>

<p>man.viewer Specify the programs that may be used to
display help in the man format. See git-help(1).</p>

<p>man.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd Specify the command to invoke the
specified man viewer. The specified command is evaluated in
shell with the man page passed as argument. (See
git-help(1).)</p>

<p>man.&lt;tool&gt;.path Override the path for the given
tool that may be used to display help in the man format. See
git-help(1).</p>

<p>merge.conflictstyle Specify the style in which
conflicted hunks are written out to working tree files upon
merge. The default is &quot;merge&quot;, which shows a
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; conflict marker, changes made
by one side, a ======= marker, changes made by the other
side, and then a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marker. An
alternate style, &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a ||||||| marker
and the original text before the ======= marker.</p>

<p>merge.log Whether to include summaries of merged commits
in newly created merge commit messages. False by
default.</p>

<p>merge.renameLimit The number of files to consider when
performing rename detection during a merge; if not
specified, defaults to the value of diff.renameLimit.</p>

<p>merge.stat Whether to print the diffstat between
ORIG_HEAD and the merge result at the end of the merge. True
by default.</p>

<p>merge.tool Controls which merge resolution program is
used by git- mergetool(1). Valid built-in values are:
&quot;kdiff3&quot;, &quot;tkdiff&quot;, &quot;meld&quot;,
&quot;xxdiff&quot;, &quot;emerge&quot;, &quot;vimdiff&quot;,
&quot;gvimdiff&quot;, &quot;diffuse&quot;,
&quot;ecmerge&quot;, &quot;tortoisemerge&quot;,
&quot;p4merge&quot;, &quot;araxis&quot; and
&quot;opendiff&quot;. Any other value is treated is custom
merge tool and there must be a corresponding
mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd option.</p>

<p>merge.verbosity Controls the amount of output shown by
the recursive merge strategy. Level 0 outputs nothing except
a final error message if conflicts were detected. Level 1
outputs only conflicts, 2 outputs conflicts and file
changes. Level 5 and above outputs debugging information.
The default is level 2. Can be overridden by the
GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY environment variable.</p>

<p>merge.&lt;driver&gt;.name Defines a human-readable name
for a custom low-level merge driver. See gitattributes(5)
for details.</p>

<p>merge.&lt;driver&gt;.driver Defines the command that
implements a custom low-level merge driver. See
gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p>merge.&lt;driver&gt;.recursive Names a low-level merge
driver to be used when performing an internal merge between
common ancestors. See gitattributes(5) for details.</p>

<p>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.path Override the path for the
given tool. This is useful in case your tool is not in the
PATH.</p>

<p>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd Specify the command to invoke
the specified merge tool. The specified command is evaluated
in shell with the following variables available: BASE is the
name of a temporary file containing the common base of the
files to be merged, if available; LOCAL is the name of a
temporary file containing the contents of the file on the
current branch; REMOTE is the name of a temporary file
containing the contents of the file from the branch being
merged; MERGED contains the name of the file to which the
merge tool should write the results of a successful
merge.</p>

<p>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode For a custom merge
command, specify whether the exit code of the merge command
can be used to determine whether the merge was successful.
If this is not set to true then the merge target file
timestamp is checked and the merge assumed to have been
successful if the file has been updated, otherwise the user
is prompted to indicate the success of the merge.</p>

<p>mergetool.keepBackup After performing a merge, the
original file with conflict markers can be saved as a file
with a .orig extension. If this variable is set to false
then this file is not preserved. Defaults to true (i.e. keep
the backup files).</p>

<p>mergetool.keepTemporaries When invoking a custom merge
tool, git uses a set of temporary files to pass to the tool.
If the tool returns an error and this variable is set to
true, then these temporary files will be preserved,
otherwise they will be removed after the tool has exited.
Defaults to false.</p>

<p>mergetool.prompt Prompt before each invocation of the
merge resolution program.</p>

<p>notes.displayRef The (fully qualified) refname from
which to show notes when showing commit messages. The value
of this variable can be set to a glob, in which case notes
from all matching refs will be shown. You may also specify
this configuration variable several times. A warning will be
issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that does not
match any refs is silently ignored.</p>

<p>This setting can be overridden with the
GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF environment variable, which must be a
colon separated list of refs or globs.</p>

<p>The effective value of &quot;core.notesRef&quot;
(possibly overridden by GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly
added to the list of refs to be displayed.</p>

<p>notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt; When rewriting commits
with &lt;command&gt; (currently amend or rebase) and this
variable is set to true, git automatically copies your notes
from the original to the rewritten commit. Defaults to true,
but see &quot;notes.rewriteRef&quot; below.</p>

<p>This setting can be overridden with the
GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF environment variable, which must be a
colon separated list of refs or globs.</p>

<p>notes.rewriteMode When copying notes during a rewrite
(see the &quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; option),
determines what to do if the target commit already has a
note. Must be one of overwrite, concatenate, or ignore.
Defaults to concatenate.</p>

<p>This setting can be overridden with the
GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE environment variable.</p>

<p>notes.rewriteRef When copying notes during a rewrite,
specifies the (fully qualified) ref whose notes should be
copied. The ref may be a glob, in which case notes in all
matching refs will be copied. You may also specify this
configuration several times.</p>

<p>Does not have a default value; you must configure this
variable to enable note rewriting.</p>

<p>pack.window The size of the window used by
git-pack-objects(1) when no window size is given on the
command line. Defaults to 10.</p>

<p>pack.depth The maximum delta depth used by
git-pack-objects(1) when no maximum depth is given on the
command line. Defaults to 50.</p>

<p>pack.windowMemory The window memory size limit used by
git-pack-objects(1) when no limit is given on the command
line. The value can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
&quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. Defaults to 0, meaning no
limit.</p>

<p>pack.compression An integer -1..9, indicating the
compression level for objects in a pack file. -1 is the zlib
default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are various
speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set, defaults
to core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to -1, the
zlib default, which is &quot;a default compromise between
speed and compression (currently equivalent to level
6).&quot;</p>

<p>pack.deltaCacheSize The maximum memory in bytes used for
caching deltas in git-pack- objects(1) before writing them
out to a pack. This cache is used to speed up the writing
object phase by not having to recompute the final delta
result once the best match for all objects is found.
Repacking large repositories on machines which are tight
with memory might be badly impacted by this though,
especially if this cache pushes the system into swapping. A
value of 0 means no limit. The smallest size of 1 byte may
be used to virtually disable this cache. Defaults to 256
MiB.</p>

<p>pack.deltaCacheLimit The maximum size of a delta, that
is cached in git-pack-objects(1). This cache is used to
speed up the writing object phase by not having to recompute
the final delta result once the best match for all objects
is found. Defaults to 1000.</p>

<p>pack.threads Specifies the number of threads to spawn
when searching for best delta matches. This requires that
git-pack-objects(1) be compiled with pthreads otherwise this
option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce
packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount
of memory for the delta search window is however multiplied
by the number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause git to
auto-detect the number of CPUs and set the number of threads
accordingly.</p>

<p>pack.indexVersion Specify the default pack index
version. Valid values are 1 for legacy pack index used by
Git versions prior to 1.5.2, and 2 for the new pack index
with capabilities for packs larger than 4 GB as well as
proper protection against the repacking of corrupted packs.
Version 2 is the default. Note that version 2 is enforced
and this config option ignored whenever the corresponding
pack is larger than 2 GB.</p>

<p>If you have an old git that does not understand the
version 2 *.idx file, cloning or fetching over a non native
protocol (e.g. &quot;http&quot; and &quot;rsync&quot;) that
will copy both *.pack file and corresponding *.idx file from
the other side may give you a repository that cannot be
accessed with your older version of git. If the *.pack file
is smaller than 2 GB, however, you can use git-index-pack(1)
on the *.pack file to regenerate the *.idx file.</p>

<p>pack.packSizeLimit The maximum size of a pack. This
setting only affects packing to a file when repacking, i.e.
the git:// protocol is unaffected. It can be overridden by
the --max-pack-size option of git-repack(1). The minimum
size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. The default is unlimited.
Common unit suffixes of k, m, or g are supported.</p>

<p>pager.&lt;cmd&gt; Allows turning on or off pagination of
the output of a particular git subcommand when writing to a
tty. If --paginate or --no-pager is specified on the command
line, it takes precedence over this option. To disable
pagination for all commands, set core.pager or GIT_PAGER to
cat.</p>

<p>pull.octopus The default merge strategy to use when
pulling multiple branches at once.</p>

<p>pull.twohead The default merge strategy to use when
pulling a single branch.</p>

<p>push.default Defines the action git push should take if
no refspec is given on the command line, no refspec is
configured in the remote, and no refspec is implied by any
of the options given on the command line. Possible values
are:</p>

<p>&middot; nothing do not push anything.</p>

<p>&middot; matching push all matching branches. All
branches having the same name in both ends are considered to
be matching. This is the default.</p>

<p>&middot; tracking push the current branch to its
upstream branch.</p>

<p>&middot; current push the current branch to a branch of
the same name.</p>

<p>rebase.stat Whether to show a diffstat of what changed
upstream since the last rebase. False by default.</p>

<p>receive.autogc By default, git-receive-pack will run
&quot;git-gc --auto&quot; after receiving data from git-push
and updating refs. You can stop it by setting this variable
to false.</p>

<p>receive.fsckObjects If it is set to true,
git-receive-pack will check all received objects. It will
abort in the case of a malformed object or a broken link.
The result of an abort are only dangling objects. Defaults
to false.</p>

<p>receive.unpackLimit If the number of objects received in
a push is below this limit then the objects will be unpacked
into loose object files. However if the number of received
objects equals or exceeds this limit then the received pack
will be stored as a pack, after adding any missing delta
bases. Storing the pack from a push can make the push
operation complete faster, especially on slow filesystems.
If not set, the value of transfer.unpackLimit is used
instead.</p>

<p>receive.denyDeletes If set to true, git-receive-pack
will deny a ref update that deletes the ref. Use this to
prevent such a ref deletion via a push.</p>

<p>receive.denyCurrentBranch If set to true or
&quot;refuse&quot;, receive-pack will deny a ref update to
the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository.
Such a push is potentially dangerous because it brings the
HEAD out of sync with the index and working tree. If set to
&quot;warn&quot;, print a warning of such a push to stderr,
but allow the push to proceed. If set to false or
&quot;ignore&quot;, allow such pushes with no message.
Defaults to &quot;refuse&quot;.</p>

<p>receive.denyNonFastForwards If set to true,
git-receive-pack will deny a ref update which is not a
fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an update via a push,
even if that push is forced. This configuration variable is
set when initializing a shared repository.</p>

<p>receive.updateserverinfo If set to true,
git-receive-pack will run git-update-server-info after
receiving data from git-push and updating refs.</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url The URL of a remote repository.
See git-fetch(1) or git-push(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl The push URL of a remote
repository. See git-push(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy For remotes that require curl
(http, https and ftp), the URL to the proxy to use for that
remote. Set to the empty string to disable proxying for that
remote.</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.fetch The default set of
&quot;refspec&quot; for git-fetch(1). See git-fetch(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.push The default set of
&quot;refspec&quot; for git-push(1). See git-push(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.mirror If true, pushing to this
remote will automatically behave as if the --mirror option
was given on the command line.</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipDefaultUpdate If true, this
remote will be skipped by default when updating using
git-fetch(1) or the update subcommand of git-remote(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipFetchAll If true, this remote
will be skipped by default when updating using git-fetch(1)
or the update subcommand of git-remote(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.receivepack The default program to
execute on the remote side when pushing. See option
--receive-pack of git-push(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.uploadpack The default program to
execute on the remote side when fetching. See option
--upload-pack of git-fetch-pack(1).</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagopt Setting this value to
--no-tags disables automatic tag following when fetching
from remote &lt;name&gt;</p>

<p>remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs Setting this to a value
&lt;vcs&gt; will cause git to interact with the remote with
the git-remote-&lt;vcs&gt; helper.</p>

<p>remotes.&lt;group&gt; The list of remotes which are
fetched by &quot;git remote update &lt;group&gt;&quot;. See
git-remote(1).</p>

<p>repack.usedeltabaseoffset By default, git-repack(1)
creates packs that use delta-base offset. If you need to
share your repository with git older than version 1.4.4,
either directly or via a dumb protocol such as http, then
you need to set this option to &quot;false&quot; and repack.
Access from old git versions over the native protocol are
unaffected by this option.</p>

<p>rerere.autoupdate When set to true, git-rerere updates
the index with the resulting contents after it cleanly
resolves conflicts using previously recorded resolution.
Defaults to false.</p>

<p>rerere.enabled Activate recording of resolved conflicts,
so that identical conflict hunks can be resolved
automatically, should they be encountered again.
git-rerere(1) command is by default enabled if you create
rr-cache directory under $GIT_DIR, but can be disabled by
setting this option to false.</p>

<p>sendemail.identity A configuration identity. When given,
causes values in the sendemail.&lt;identity&gt; subsection
to take precedence over values in the sendemail section. The
default identity is the value of sendemail.identity.</p>

<p>sendemail.smtpencryption See git-send-email(1) for
description. Note that this setting is not subject to the
identity mechanism.</p>

<p>sendemail.smtpssl Deprecated alias for
sendemail.smtpencryption = ssl.</p>

<p>sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;.* Identity-specific versions
of the sendemail.* parameters found below, taking precedence
over those when the this identity is selected, through
command-line or sendemail.identity.</p>

<p>sendemail.aliasesfile, sendemail.aliasfiletype,
sendemail.bcc, sendemail.cc, sendemail.cccmd,
sendemail.chainreplyto, sendemail.confirm,
sendemail.envelopesender, sendemail.from,
sendemail.multiedit, sendemail.signedoffbycc,
sendemail.smtppass, sendemail.suppresscc,
sendemail.suppressfrom, sendemail.to, sendemail.smtpserver,
sendemail.smtpserverport, sendemail.smtpuser,
sendemail.thread, sendemail.validate See git-send-email(1)
for description.</p>

<p>sendemail.signedoffcc Deprecated alias for
sendemail.signedoffbycc.</p>

<p>showbranch.default The default set of branches for
git-show-branch(1). See git-show- branch(1).</p>

<p>status.relativePaths By default, git-status(1) shows
paths relative to the current directory. Setting this
variable to false shows paths relative to the repository
root (this was the default for git prior to v1.5.4).</p>

<p>status.showUntrackedFiles By default, git-status(1) and
git-commit(1) show files which are not currently tracked by
Git. Directories which contain only untracked files, are
shown with the directory name only. Showing untracked files
means that Git needs to lstat() all all the files in the
whole repository, which might be slow on some systems. So,
this variable controls how the commands displays the
untracked files. Possible values are:</p>

<p>&middot; no - Show no untracked files</p>

<p>&middot; normal - Shows untracked files and
directories</p>

<p>&middot; all - Shows also individual files in untracked
directories. If this variable is not specified, it defaults
to normal. This variable can be overridden with the
-u|--untracked-files option of git-status(1) and
git-commit(1).</p>

<p>tar.umask This variable can be used to restrict the
permission bits of tar archive entries. The default is 0002,
which turns off the world write bit. The special value
&quot;user&quot; indicates that the archiving users umask
will be used instead. See umask(2) and git-archive(1).</p>

<p>transfer.unpackLimit When fetch.unpackLimit or
receive.unpackLimit are not set, the value of this variable
is used instead. The default value is 100.</p>

<p>url.&lt;base&gt;.insteadOf Any URL that starts with this
value will be rewritten to start, instead, with
&lt;base&gt;. In cases where some site serves a large number
of repositories, and serves them with multiple access
methods, and some users need to use different access
methods, this feature allows people to specify any of the
equivalent URLs and have git automatically rewrite the URL
to the best alternative for the particular user, even for a
never-before-seen repository on the site. When more than one
insteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match is
used.</p>

<p>url.&lt;base&gt;.pushInsteadOf Any URL that starts with
this value will not be pushed to; instead, it will be
rewritten to start with &lt;base&gt;, and the resulting URL
will be pushed to. In cases where some site serves a large
number of repositories, and serves them with multiple access
methods, some of which do not allow push, this feature
allows people to specify a pull-only URL and have git
automatically use an appropriate URL to push, even for a
never-before-seen repository on the site. When more than one
pushInsteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match
is used. If a remote has an explicit pushurl, git will
ignore this setting for that remote.</p>

<p>user.email Your email address to be recorded in any
newly created commits. Can be overridden by the
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, and EMAIL environment
variables. See git-commit-tree(1).</p>

<p>user.name Your full name to be recorded in any newly
created commits. Can be overridden by the GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
and GIT_COMMITTER_NAME environment variables. See
git-commit-tree(1).</p>

<p>user.signingkey If git-tag(1) is not selecting the key
you want it to automatically when creating a signed tag, you
can override the default selection with this variable. This
option is passed unchanged to gpgs --local-user parameter,
so you may specify a key using any method that gpg
supports.</p>

<p>web.browser Specify a web browser that may be used by
some commands. Currently only git-instaweb(1) and
git-help(1) may use it.</p>
