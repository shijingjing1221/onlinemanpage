<p>POSIX_TRACE_GET_FILTER(3P) POSIX Programmer s
ManualPOSIX_TRACE_GET_FILTER(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_get_filter, posix_trace_set_filter -
retrieve and set the filter of an initialized trace stream
(TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_get_filter(trace_id_t trid,
trace_event_set_t *set); int
posix_trace_set_filter(trace_id_t trid, const
trace_event_set_t *set, int how);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_get_filter() function shall
retrieve, into the argument pointed to by set, the actual
trace event filter from the trace stream specified by
trid.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_set_filter() function shall change the
set of filtered trace event types after a trace stream
identified by the trid argument is created. This function
may be called prior to starting the trace stream, or while
the trace stream is active. By default, if no call is made
to posix_trace_set_filter(), all trace events shall be
recorded (that is, none of the trace event types are
filtered out).</p>

<p>If this function is called while the trace is in
progress, a special system trace event, POSIX_TRACE_FILTER,
shall be recorded in the trace indicating both the old and
the new sets of filtered trace event types (see Trace and
Trace Event Filter Options: System Trace Events and Trace,
Trace Log, and Trace Event Filter Options: System Trace
Events ).</p>

<p>If the posix_trace_set_filter() function is interrupted
by a signal, an error shall be returned and the filter shall
not be changed. In this case, the state of the trace stream
shall not be changed.</p>

<p>The value of the argument how indicates the manner in
which the set is to be changed and shall have one of the
following values, as defined in the &lt;trace.h&gt;
header:</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_SET_EVENTSET</p>

<p>The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered
shall be the trace event type set pointed to by the argument
set.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_ADD_EVENTSET</p>

<p>The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered
shall be the union of the current set and the trace event
type set pointed to by the argument set.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_SUB_EVENTSET</p>

<p>The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered
shall be all trace event types in the current set that are
not in the set pointed to by the argument set; that is,
remove each element of the specified set from the current
filter.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_get_filter() function stores the set of
filtered trace event types in set, if successful.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the trid argument does not
correspond to an active trace stream or the value of the
argument pointed to by set is invalid.</p>

<p>EINTR The operation was interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
