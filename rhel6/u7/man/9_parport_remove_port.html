<p>PARPORT_REMOVE_PORT(9) Parallel Port Devices
PARPORT_REMOVE_PORT(9)</p>

<p>NAME parport_remove_port - deregister a parallel
port</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void parport_remove_port(struct parport *
port);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS port parallel port to deregister</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When a parallel port driver is forcibly
unloaded, or a parallel port becomes inaccessible, the port
driver must call this function in order to deal with device
drivers that still want to use it.</p>

<p>The parport structure associated with the port has its
operations structure replaced with one containing
&acute;null&acute; operations that return errors or just
don&acute;t do anything.</p>

<p>Any drivers that have registered themselves using
parport_register_driver are notified that the port is no
longer accessible by having their detach routines called
with port as the parameter.</p>
