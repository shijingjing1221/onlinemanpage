<p>The handling of authors names that had apostrophes has
been fixed.</p>

<p>Any enums with negative values are now skipped.</p>

<p>&quot;perlivp&quot; enhancements &quot;perlivp&quot;
implements new option &quot;-a&quot; and will not check for
*.ph files by default any more. Use the &quot;-a&quot;
option to run all tests.</p>

<p>New Documentation The perlglossary manpage is a glossary
of terms used in the Perl documentation, technical and
otherwise, kindly provided by OReilly Media, inc.</p>

<p>Performance Enhancements &middot; Weak reference
creation is now O(1) rather than O(n), courtesy of Nicholas
Clark. Weak reference deletion remains O(n), but if deletion
only happens at program exit, it may be skipped
completely.</p>

<p>&middot; Salvador Fandin~o provided improvements to
reduce the memory usage of &quot;sort&quot; and to speed up
some cases.</p>

<p>&middot; Jarkko Hietaniemi and Andy Lester worked to
mark as much data as possible in the C source files as
&quot;static&quot;, to increase the proportion of the
executable file that the operating system can share between
process, and thus reduce real memory usage on multi- user
systems.</p>

<p>Installation and Configuration Improvements Parallel
makes should work properly now, although there may still be
problems if &quot;make test&quot; is instructed to run in
parallel.</p>

<p>Building with Borlands compilers on Win32 should work
more smoothly. In particular Steve Hay has worked to side
step many warnings emitted by their compilers and at least
one C compiler internal error.</p>

<p>&quot;Configure&quot; will now detect
&quot;clearenv&quot; and &quot;unsetenv&quot;, thanks to a
patch from Alan Burlison. It will also probe for
&quot;futimes&quot; and whether &quot;sprintf&quot;
correctly returns the length of the formatted string, which
will both be used in perl 5.8.9.</p>

<p>There are improved hints for next-3.0, vmesa, IX,
Darwin, Solaris, Linux, DEC/OSF, HP-UX and MPE/iX</p>

<p>Perl extensions on Windows now can be statically built
into the Perl DLL, thanks to a work by Vadim Konovalov.
(This improvement was actually in 5.8.7, but was
accidentally omitted from perl587delta).</p>

<p>Selected Bug Fixes no warningscategoryworks correctly
with -w Previously when running with warnings enabled
globally via &quot;-w&quot;, selective disabling of specific
warning categories would actually turn off all warnings.
This is now fixed; now &quot;no warnings
&rsquo;io&rsquo;;&quot; will only turn off warnings in the
&quot;io&quot; class. Previously it would erroneously turn
off all warnings.</p>

<p>This bug fix may cause some programs to start correctly
issuing warnings.</p>

<p>Remove over-optimisation Perl 5.8.4 introduced a change
so that assignments of &quot;undef&quot; to a scalar, or of
an empty list to an array or a hash, were optimised away. As
this could cause problems when &quot;goto&quot; jumps were
involved, this change has been backed out.</p>

<p>sprintf() fixes Using the sprintf() function with some
formats could lead to a buffer overflow in some specific
cases. This has been fixed, along with several other bugs,
notably in bounds checking.</p>

<p>In related fixes, it was possible for badly written code
that did not follow the documentation of
&quot;Sys::Syslog&quot; to have formatting vulnerabilities.
&quot;Sys::Syslog&quot; has been changed to protect people
from poor quality third party code.</p>

<p>Debugger and Unicode slowdown It had been reported that
running under perl s debugger when processing Unicode data
could cause unexpectedly large slowdowns. The most likely
cause of this was identified and fixed by Nicholas
Clark.</p>

<p>Smaller fixes &middot; &quot;FindBin&quot; now works
better with directories where access rights are more
restrictive than usual.</p>

<p>&middot; Several memory leaks in ithreads were closed.
An improved implementation of &quot;threads::shared&quot; is
available on CPAN - this will be merged into 5.8.9 if it
proves stable.</p>

<p>&middot; Trailing spaces are now trimmed from $! and
$^E.</p>

<p>&middot; Operations that require perl to read a process
list of groups, such as reads of $( and $), now dynamically
allocate memory rather than using a fixed sized array. The
fixed size array could cause C stack exhaustion on systems
configured to use large numbers of groups.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; now works better
with non-default $/ settings.</p>

<p>&middot; You can now use the &quot;x&quot; operator to
repeat a &quot;qw//&quot; list. This used to raise a syntax
error.</p>

<p>&middot; The debugger now traces correctly execution in
eval(&quot;&quot;)uated code that contains #line
directives.</p>

<p>&middot; The value of the &quot;open&quot; pragma is no
longer ignored for three- argument opens.</p>

<p>&middot; The optimisation of &quot;for (reverse
@a)&quot; introduced in perl 5.8.6 could misbehave when the
array had undefined elements and was used in LVALUE context.
Dave Mitchell provided a fix.</p>

<p>&middot; Some case insensitive matches between UTF-8
encoded data and 8 bit regexps, and vice versa, could give
malformed character warnings. These have been fixed by Dave
Mitchell and Yves Orton.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;lcfirst&quot; and &quot;ucfirst&quot;
could corrupt the string for certain cases where the length
UTF-8 encoding of the string in lower case, upper case or
title case differed. This was fixed by Nicholas Clark.</p>

<p>&middot; Perl will now use the C library calls
&quot;unsetenv&quot; and &quot;clearenv&quot; if present to
delete keys from %ENV and delete %ENV entirely, thanks to a
patch from Alan Burlison.</p>

<p>New or Changed Diagnostics Attempt to set length of
freed array This is a new warning, produced in situations
such as this:</p>

<p>$r = do {my @a; a}; $$r = 503;</p>

<p>Non-string passed as bitmask This is a new warning,
produced when number has been passed as a argument to
select(), instead of a bitmask.</p>

<p># Wrong, will now warn $rin = fileno(STDIN);
($nfound,$timeleft) = select($rout=$rin, undef, undef,
$timeout);</p>

<p># Should be $rin = &rsquo;&rsquo;;
vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1; ($nfound,$timeleft) =
select($rout=$rin, undef, undef, $timeout);</p>

<p>Search pattern not terminated or ternary operator parsed
as search pattern This syntax error indicates that the lexer
couldnt find the final delimiter of a &quot;?PATTERN?&quot;
construct. Mentioning the ternary operator in this error
message makes it easier to diagnose syntax errors.</p>

<p>Changed Internals There has been a fair amount of
refactoring of the &quot;C&quot; source code, partly to make
it tidier and more maintainable. The resulting object code
and the &quot;perl&quot; binary may well be smaller than
5.8.7, in particular due to a change contributed by Dave
Mitchell which reworked the warnings code to be
significantly smaller. Apart from being smaller and possibly
faster, there should be no user-detectable changes.</p>

<p>Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine
which function parameters and local variables could actually
be declared &quot;const&quot; to the C compiler. Steve
Peters provided new *_set macros and reworked the core to
use these rather than assigning to macros in LVALUE
context.</p>

<p>Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under
&quot;-DT&quot;</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark changed the string buffer allocation so
that it is now rounded up to the next multiple of 4 (or 8 on
platforms with 64 bit pointers). This should reduce the
number of calls to &quot;realloc&quot; without actually
using any extra memory.</p>

<p>The &quot;HV&quot;s array of &quot;HE*&quot;s is now
allocated at the correct (minimal) size, thanks to another
change by Nicholas Clark. Compile with
&quot;-DPERL_USE_LARGE_HV_ALLOC&quot; to use the old,
sloppier, default.</p>

<p>For XS or embedding debugging purposes, if perl is
compiled with &quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS_FORK_DUMP&quot;
in addition to &quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot; then a
child process is &quot;fork&quot;ed just before global
destruction, which is used to display the values of any
scalars found to have leaked at the end of global
destruction. Without this, the scalars have already been
freed sufficiently at the point of detection that it is
impossible to produce any meaningful dump of their contents.
This feature was implemented by the indefatigable Nicholas
Clark, based on an idea by Mike Giroux.</p>

<p>Platform Specific Problems The optimiser on HP-UX 11.23
(Itanium 2) is currently partly disabled (scaled down to
+O1) when using HP C-ANSI-C; the cause of problems at higher
optimisation levels is still unclear.</p>

<p>There are a handful of remaining test failures on VMS,
mostly due to test fixes and minor module tweaks with too
many dependencies to integrate into this release from the
development stream, where they have all been corrected. The
following is a list of expected failures with the patch
number of the fix where that is known:</p>

<p>ext/Devel/PPPort/t/ppphtest.t #26913
ext/List/Util/t/p_tainted.t #26912 lib/ExtUtils/t/PL_FILES.t
#26813 lib/ExtUtils/t/basic.t #26813 t/io/fs.t
t/op/cmp.t</p>

<p>Reporting Bugs If you find what you think is a bug, you
might check the articles recently posted to the
comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run
the perlbug program included with your release. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your
bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the
Perl porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs
at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
