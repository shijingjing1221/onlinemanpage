<p>NAME dcraw - command-line decoder for raw digital
photos</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dcraw [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dcraw decodes raw photos, displays metadata,
and extracts thumbnails.</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS -v Print verbose messages, not just
warnings and errors.</p>

<p>-c Write decoded images or thumbnails to standard
output.</p>

<p>-e Extract the camera-generated thumbnail, not the raw
image. Youll get either a JPEG or a PPM file, depending on
the camera.</p>

<p>-z Change the access and modification times of an AVI,
JPEG, TIFF or raw file to when the photo was taken, assuming
that the cam- era clock was set to Universal Time.</p>

<p>-i Identify files but dont decode them. Exit status is 0
if dcraw can decode the last file, 1 if it can t. -i -v
shows metadata.</p>

<p>dcraw cannot decode JPEG files!!</p>

<p>REPAIR OPTIONS -P deadpixels.txt Read the dead pixel
list from this file instead of &quot;.badpixels&quot;. See
FILES for a description of the format.</p>

<p>-K darkframe.pgm Subtract a dark frame from the raw
data. To generate a dark frame, shoot a raw photo with no
light and do dcraw -D -4 -j -t 0.</p>

<p>-k darkness When shadows appear foggy, you need to raise
the darkness level. To measure this, apply pamsumm -mean to
the dark frame generated above.</p>

<p>-S saturation When highlights appear pink, you need to
lower the saturation level. To measure this, take a picture
of something shiny and do dcraw -D -4 -j -c photo.raw |
pamsumm -max</p>

<p>The default darkness and saturation are usually
correct.</p>

<p>-n noise_threshold Use wavelets to erase noise while
preserving real detail. The best threshold should be
somewhere between 100 and 1000.</p>

<p>-C red_mag blue_mag Enlarge the raw red and blue layers
by the given factors, typi- cally 0.999 to 1.001, to correct
chromatic aberration.</p>

<p>-H 0 Clip all highlights to solid white (default).</p>

<p>-H 1 Leave highlights unclipped in various shades of
pink.</p>

<p>-H 2 Blend clipped and unclipped values together for a
gradual fade to white.</p>

<p>-H 3+ Reconstruct highlights. Low numbers favor whites;
high numbers favor colors. Try -H 5 as a compromise. If that
s not good enough, do -H 9, cut out the non-white
highlights, and paste them into an image generated with -H
3.</p>

<p>COLOR OPTIONS By default, dcraw uses a fixed white
balance based on a color chart illuminated with a standard
D65 lamp.</p>

<p>-w Use the white balance specified by the camera. If
this is not found, print a warning and use another
method.</p>

<p>-a Calculate the white balance by averaging the entire
image.</p>

<p>-A left top width height Calculate the white balance by
averaging a rectangular area. First do dcraw -j -t 0 and
select an area of neutral grey color.</p>

<p>-r mul0 mul1 mul2 mul3 Specify your own raw white
balance. These multipliers can be cut and pasted from the
output of dcraw -v.</p>

<p>+M or -M Use (or dont use) any color matrix from the
camera metadata. The default is +M if -w is set, -M
otherwise. This option only affects Olympus, Leaf, and Phase
One cameras.</p>

<p>-o [0-5] Select the output colorspace when the -p option
is not used:</p>

<p>0 Raw color (unique to each camera) 1 sRGB D65 (default)
2 Adobe RGB (1998) D65 3 Wide Gamut RGB D65 4 Kodak ProPhoto
RGB D65 5 XYZ</p>

<p>-p camera.icm [ -o output.icm ] Use ICC profiles to
define the camera s raw colorspace and the desired output
colorspace (sRGB by default).</p>

<p>-p embed Use the ICC profile embedded in the raw
photo.</p>

<p>INTERPOLATION OPTIONS -d Show the raw data as a
grayscale image with no interpolation. Good for
photographing black-and-white documents.</p>

<p>-D Same as -d, but totally raw (no color scaling).</p>

<p>-h Output a half-size color image. Twice as fast as -q
0.</p>

<p>-q 0 Use high-speed, low-quality bilinear
interpolation.</p>

<p>-q 1 Use Variable Number of Gradients (VNG)
interpolation.</p>

<p>-q 2 Use Patterned Pixel Grouping (PPG)
interpolation.</p>

<p>-q 3 Use Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed (AHD)
interpolation.</p>

<p>-f Interpolate RGB as four colors. Use this if the
output shows false 2x2 meshes with VNG or mazes with
AHD.</p>

<p>-m number_of_passes After interpolation, clean up color
artifacts by repeatedly applying a 3x3 median filter to the
R-G and B-G channels.</p>

<p>OUTPUT OPTIONS By default, dcraw writes PGM/PPM/PAM with
8-bit samples, a BT.709 gamma curve, a histogram-based white
level, and no metadata.</p>

<p>-W Use a fixed white level, ignoring the image
histogram.</p>

<p>-b brightness Divide the white level by this number, 1.0
by default.</p>

<p>-g power toe_slope Set the gamma curve, by default
BT.709 (-g 2.222 4.5). If you prefer sRGB gamma, use -g 2.4
12.92. For a simple power curve, set the toe slope to
zero.</p>

<p>-6 Write sixteen bits per sample instead of eight.</p>

<p>-4 Linear 16-bit, same as -6 -W -g 1 1.</p>

<p>-T Write TIFF with metadata instead of PGM/PPM/PAM.</p>

<p>-t [0-7,90,180,270] Flip the output image. By default,
dcraw applies the flip spec- ified by the camera. -t 0
disables all flipping.</p>

<p>-j For Fuji Super CCD cameras, show the image tilted 45
degrees. For cameras with non-square pixels, do not stretch
the image to its correct aspect ratio. In any case, this
option guarantees that each output pixel corresponds to one
raw pixel.</p>

<p>-s [0..N-1] or -s all If a file contains N raw images,
choose one or &quot;all&quot; to decode. For example, Fuji
Super CCD SR cameras generate a second image underexposed
four stops to show detail in the highlights.</p>

<p>FILES ./.badpixels, ../.badpixels, ../../.badpixels, ...
List of your cameras dead pixels, so that dcraw can
interpolate around them. Each line specifies the column,
row, and UNIX time of death for one pixel. For example:</p>

<p>962 91 1028350000 # died between August 1 and 4, 2002
1285 1067 0 # dont know when this pixel died</p>

<p>These coordinates are before any cropping or rotation,
so use dcraw -j -t 0 to locate dead pixels.</p>
