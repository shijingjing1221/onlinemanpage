<p>GIT-CHERRY-PICK(1) Git Manual GIT-CHERRY-PICK(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-cherry-pick - Apply the change introduced by an
existing commit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git cherry-pick [--edit] [-n] [-m
parent-number] [-s] [-x] [--ff] &lt;commit&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Given one existing commit, apply the change
the patch introduces, and record a new commit that records
it. This requires your working tree to be clean (no
modifications from the HEAD commit).</p>

<p>OPTIONS &lt;commit&gt; Commit to cherry-pick. For a more
complete list of ways to spell commits, see the
&quot;SPECIFYING REVISIONS&quot; section in git-rev-
parse(1).</p>

<p>-e, --edit With this option, git cherry-pick will let
you edit the commit message prior to committing.</p>

<p>-x When recording the commit, append to the original
commit message a note that indicates which commit this
change was cherry-picked from. Append the note only for
cherry picks without conflicts. Do not use this option if
you are cherry-picking from your private branch because the
information is useless to the recipient. If on the other
hand you are cherry-picking between two publicly visible
branches (e.g. backporting a fix to a maintenance branch for
an older release from a development branch), adding this
information can be useful.</p>

<p>-r It used to be that the command defaulted to do -x
described above, and -r was to disable it. Now the default
is not to do -x so this option is a no-op.</p>

<p>-m parent-number, --mainline parent-number Usually you
cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not know which
side of the merge should be considered the mainline. This
option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the
mainline and allows cherry-pick to replay the change
relative to the specified parent.</p>

<p>-n, --no-commit Usually the command automatically
creates a commit. This flag applies the change necessary to
cherry-pick the named commit to your working tree and the
index, but does not make the commit. In addition, when this
option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD
commit. The cherry-pick is done against the beginning state
of your index.</p>

<p>This is useful when cherry-picking more than one
commits&acute; effect to your index in a row.</p>

<p>-s, --signoff Add Signed-off-by line at the end of the
commit message.</p>

<p>--ff If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of
the cherry-picked commit, then a fast forward to this commit
will be performed.</p>
