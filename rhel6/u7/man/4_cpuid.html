<p>NAME cpuid - x86 CPUID access device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTIONS CPUID provides an interface for querying
information about the x86 CPU.</p>

<p>This device is accessed by lseek(2) or pread(2) to the
appropriate CPUID level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes. A
larger read size means multiple reads of consecutive
levels.</p>

<p>The lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the
incoming %eax, and the upper 32 bits of the file position as
the incoming %ecx, the latter intended for
&quot;counting&quot; eax levels like eax=4.</p>

<p>This driver uses /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid, where CPUNUM is
the minor num- ber, and on an SMP box will direct the access
to CPU CPUNUM as listed in /proc/cpuinfo.</p>

<p>This file is protected so that it can only be read by
the user root, or members of the group root.</p>

<p>NOTES The CPUID instruction can be directly executed by
a program using inline assembler. However this device allows
convenient access to all CPUs without changing process
affinity.</p>

<p>Most of the information in cpuid is reported by the
kernel in cooked form either in /proc/cpuinfo or through
subdirectories in /sys/devices/system/cpu. Direct CPUID
access through this device should only be used in
exceptional cases.</p>

<p>The cpuid driver is not auto-loaded. On modular kernels
you might need to use the following command to load it
explicitly before use:</p>

<p>$ modprobe cpuid</p>

<p>There is no support for CPUID functions that require
additional input registers.</p>

<p>Very old x86 CPUs dont support CPUID.</p>
