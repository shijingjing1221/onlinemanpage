<p>GIT-SEND-PACK(1) Git Manual GIT-SEND-PACK(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-send-pack - Push objects over git protocol to
another repository</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git send-pack [--all] [--dry-run] [--force]
[--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;] [--verbose]
[--thin] [&lt;host&gt;:]&lt;directory&gt;
[&lt;ref&gt;...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Usually you would want to use git push,
which is a higher-level wrapper of this command, instead.
See git-push(1).</p>

<p>Invokes git-receive-pack on a possibly remote
repository, and updates it from the current repository,
sending named refs.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt; Path to
the git-receive-pack program on the remote end. Sometimes
useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you
do not have the program in a directory on the default
$PATH.</p>

<p>--exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt; Same as
--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;.</p>

<p>--all Instead of explicitly specifying which refs to
update, update all heads that locally exist.</p>

<p>--dry-run Do everything except actually send the
updates.</p>

<p>--force Usually, the command refuses to update a remote
ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to
overwrite it. This flag disables the check. What this means
is that the remote repository can lose commits; use it with
care.</p>

<p>--verbose Run verbosely.</p>

<p>--thin Send a &quot;thin&quot; pack, which records
objects in deltified form based on objects not included in
the pack to reduce network traffic.</p>

<p>&lt;host&gt; A remote host to house the repository. When
this part is specified, git-receive-pack is invoked via
ssh.</p>

<p>&lt;directory&gt; The repository to update.</p>

<p>&lt;ref&gt;... The remote refs to update.</p>

<p>SPECIFYING THE REFS There are three ways to specify
which refs to update on the remote end.</p>

<p>With --all flag, all refs that exist locally are
transferred to the remote side. You cannot specify any
&lt;ref&gt; if you use this flag.</p>

<p>Without --all and without any &lt;ref&gt;, the heads
that exist both on the local side and on the remote side are
updated.</p>

<p>When one or more &lt;ref&gt; are specified explicitly,
it can be either a single pattern, or a pair of such pattern
separated by a colon &quot;:&quot; (this means that a ref
name cannot have a colon in it). A single pattern
&lt;name&gt; is just a shorthand for
&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt;.</p>

<p>Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before
the colon) and the destination side (after the colon). The
ref to be pushed is determined by finding a match that
matches the source side, and where it is pushed is
determined by using the destination side. The rules used to
match a ref are the same rules used by git rev-parse to
resolve a symbolic ref name. See git-rev-parse(1).</p>

<p>&middot; It is an error if &lt;src&gt; does not match
exactly one of the local refs.</p>

<p>&middot; It is an error if &lt;dst&gt; matches more than
one remote refs.</p>

<p>&middot; If &lt;dst&gt; does not match any remote ref,
either</p>

<p>&middot; it has to start with &quot;refs/&quot;;
&lt;dst&gt; is used as the destination literally in this
case.</p>

<p>&middot; &lt;src&gt; == &lt;dst&gt; and the ref that
matched the &lt;src&gt; must not exist in the set of remote
refs; the ref matched &lt;src&gt; locally is used as the
name of the destination.</p>

<p>Without --force, the &lt;src&gt; ref is stored at the
remote only if &lt;dst&gt; does not exist, or &lt;dst&gt; is
a proper subset (i.e. an ancestor) of &lt;src&gt;. This
check, known as &quot;fast-forward check&quot;, is performed
in order to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote ref
and lose other peoples&acute; commits from there.</p>

<p>With --force, the fast-forward check is disabled for all
refs.</p>

<p>Optionally, a &lt;ref&gt; parameter can be prefixed with
a plus + sign to disable the fast-forward check only on that
ref.</p>
