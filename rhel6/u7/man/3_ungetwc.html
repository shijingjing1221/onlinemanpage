<p>NAME ungetwc - push back a wide character onto a FILE
stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wint_t ungetwc(wint_t wc, FILE *stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ungetwc() function is the wide-character
equivalent of the ungetc(3) function. It pushes back a wide
character onto stream and returns it.</p>

<p>If wc is WEOF, it returns WEOF. If wc is an invalid wide
character, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.</p>

<p>If wc is a valid wide character, it is pushed back onto
the stream and thus becomes available for future
wide-character read operations. The file-position indicator
is decremented by one or more. The end-of-file indicator is
cleared. The backing storage of the file is not
affected.</p>

<p>Note: wc need not be the last wide-character read from
the stream; it can be any other valid wide character.</p>

<p>If the implementation supports multiple push-back
operations in a row, the pushed-back wide characters will be
read in reverse order; however, only one level of push-back
is guaranteed.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The ungetwc() function returns wc when
successful, or WEOF upon fail- ure.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO C99.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of ungetwc() depends on the LC_CTYPE
category of the cur- rent locale.</p>
