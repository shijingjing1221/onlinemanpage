<p>TREE(1) TREE(1)</p>

<p>NAME tree - list contents of directories in a tree-like
format.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tree [-adfghilnopqrstuvxACDFNS] [-L level [-R]]
[-H baseHREF] [-T title] [-o filename] [--nolinks] [-P
pattern] [-I pattern] [--inodes] [--device] [--noreport]
[--dirsfirst] [--version] [--help] [--filelimit #]
[directory ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tree is a recursive directory listing
program that produces a depth indented listing of files.
Color is supported ala dircolors if the LS_COLORS
environment variable is set, output is to a tty, and the -C
flag is used. With no arguments, tree lists the files in the
current directory. When directory arguments are given, tree
lists all the files and/or directories found in the given
directories each in turn. Upon completion of listing all
files/directories found, tree returns the total number of
files and/or directories listed.</p>

<p>By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the
path that the sym- bolic link refers to is printed after the
name of the link in the for- mat:</p>

<p>name -&gt; real-path</p>

<p>If the -l option is given and the symbolic link refers
to an actual directory, then tree will follow the path of
the symbolic link as if it were a real directory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Tree understands the following command line
switches:</p>

<p>--help Outputs a verbose usage listing.</p>

<p>--version Outputs the version of tree.</p>

<p>-a All files are printed. By default tree does not print
hidden files (those beginning with a dot .). In no event
does tree print the file system constructs . (current
directory) and .. (previous directory).</p>

<p>-d List directories only.</p>

<p>-f Prints the full path prefix for each file.</p>

<p>-i Makes tree not print the indentation lines, useful
when used in conjunction with the -f option.</p>

<p>-l Follows symbolic links if they point to directories,
as if they were directories. Symbolic links that will result
in recursion are avoided when detected.</p>

<p>-x Stay on the current file-system only. Ala find
-xdev.</p>

<p>-P pattern List only those files that match the
wild-card pattern. Note: you must use the -a option to also
consider those files begin- ning with a dot . for matching.
Valid wildcard operators are * (any zero or more
characters), ? (any single character), [...] (any single
character listed between brackets (optional - (dash) for
character range may be used: ex: [A-Z]), and [^...] (any
single character not listed in brackets) and | separates
alternate patterns.</p>

<p>-I pattern Do not list those files that match the
wild-card pattern.</p>

<p>--noreport Omits printing of the file and directory
report at the end of the tree listing.</p>

<p>-p Print the file type and permissions for each file (as
per ls -l).</p>

<p>-s Print the size of each file in bytes along with the
name.</p>

<p>-h Print the size of each file but in a more human
readable way, e.g. appending a size letter for kilobytes
(K), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), terrabytes (T), petabytes
(P) and exabytes (E).</p>

<p>-u Print the username, or UID # if no username is
available, of the file.</p>

<p>-g Print the group name, or GID # if no group name is
available, of the file.</p>

<p>-D Print the date of the last modification time for the
file listed.</p>

<p>--inodes Prints the inode number of the file or
directory</p>

<p>--device Prints the device number to which the file or
directory belongs</p>

<p>-F Append a / for directories, a = for socket files, a *
for executable files and a | for FIFOs, as per ls -F</p>

<p>-q Print non-printable characters in filenames as
question marks instead of the default caret notation.</p>

<p>-N Print non-printable characters as is instead of the
default caret notation.</p>

<p>-v Sort the output by version.</p>

<p>-r Sort the output in reverse alphabetic order.</p>

<p>-t Sort the output by last modification time instead of
alphabeti- cally.</p>

<p>--dirsfirst List directories before files.</p>

<p>-n Turn colorization off always, over-ridden by the -C
option.</p>

<p>-C Turn colorization on always, using built-in color
defaults if the LS_COLORS environment variable is not set.
Useful to col- orize output to a pipe.</p>

<p>-A Turn on ANSI line graphics hack when printing the
indentation lines.</p>

<p>-S Turn on ASCII line graphics (useful when using linux
console mode fonts). This option is now equivalent to
--charset=IBM437 and will eventually be depreciated.</p>

<p>-L level Max display depth of the directory tree.</p>

<p>--filelimit # Do not descend directories that contain
more than # entries.</p>

<p>-R Recursively cross down the tree each level
directories (see -L option), and at each of them execute
tree again adding -o 00Tree.html as a new option.</p>

<p>-H baseHREF Turn on HTML output, including HTTP
references. Useful for ftp sites. baseHREF gives the base
ftp location when using HTML output. That is, the local
directory may be /local/ftp/pub, but it must be referenced
as ftp://hostname.organiza- tion.domain/pub (baseHREF should
be ftp://hostname.organiza- tion.domain). Hint: dont use
ANSI lines with this option, and don t give more than one
directory in the directory list. If you wish to use colors
via CCS stylesheet, use the -C option in addition to this
option to force color output.</p>

<p>-T title Sets the title and H1 header string in HTML
output mode.</p>

<p>--charset charset Set the character set to use when
outputting HTML and for line drawing.</p>

<p>--nolinks Turns off hyperlinks in HTML output.</p>

<p>-o filename Send output to filename.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/DIR_COLORS System color database.
~/.dircolors Users color database.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT LS_COLORS Color information created by
dircolors TREE_CHARSET Character set for tree to use in HTML
mode. LC_CTYPE Locale for filename output.</p>

<p>BUGS Tree does not prune &quot;empty&quot; directories
when the -P and -I options are used. Tree prints directories
as it comes to them, so cannot accumu- late information on
files and directories beneath the directory it is
printing.</p>

<p>The -h option rounds to the nearest whole number unlike
the ls imple- mentation of -h which rounds up always. The
IEC standard names for powers of 2 cooresponding to metric
powers of 10 (KiBi, et al.) are silly.</p>

<p>Pruning files and directories with the -I, -P and
--filelimit options will lead to incorrect file/directory
count reports.</p>

<p>Probably more.</p>
