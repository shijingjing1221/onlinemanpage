<p>PTHREAD_BARRIER_DESTROY(3P)POSIX Programmer s
ManuaPTHREAD_BARRIER_DESTROY(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_barrier_destroy, pthread_barrier_init -
destroy and initialize a barrier object (ADVANCED REALTIME
THREADS)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_barrier_destroy(pthread_barrier_t *barrier);
int pthread_barrier_init(pthread_barrier_t *restrict
barrier, const pthread_barrierattr_t *restrict attr,
unsigned count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_barrier_destroy() function shall
destroy the barrier refer- enced by barrier and release any
resources used by the barrier. The effect of subsequent use
of the barrier is undefined until the barrier is
reinitialized by another call to pthread_barrier_init(). An
imple- mentation may use this function to set barrier to an
invalid value. The results are undefined if
pthread_barrier_destroy() is called when any thread is
blocked on the barrier, or if this function is called with
an uninitialized barrier.</p>

<p>The pthread_barrier_init() function shall allocate any
resources required to use the barrier referenced by barrier
and shall initialize the barrier with attributes referenced
by attr. If attr is NULL, the default barrier attributes
shall be used; the effect is the same as passing the address
of a default barrier attributes object. The results are
undefined if pthread_barrier_init() is called when any
thread is blocked on the barrier (that is, has not returned
from the pthread_bar- rier_wait() call). The results are
undefined if a barrier is used with- out first being
initialized. The results are undefined if pthread_bar-
rier_init() is called specifying an already initialized
barrier.</p>

<p>The count argument specifies the number of threads that
must call pthread_barrier_wait() before any of them
successfully return from the call. The value specified by
count must be greater than zero.</p>

<p>If the pthread_barrier_init() function fails, the
barrier shall not be initialized and the contents of barrier
are undefined.</p>

<p>Only the object referenced by barrier may be used for
performing syn- chronization. The result of referring to
copies of that object in calls to pthread_barrier_destroy()
or pthread_barrier_wait() is undefined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return zero; other- wise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_barrier_destroy() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The implementation has detected an attempt to
destroy a barrier while it is in use (for example, while
being used in a pthread_barrier_wait() call) by another
thread.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by barrier is invalid.</p>

<p>The pthread_barrier_init() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The system lacks the necessary resources to
initialize another barrier.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by count is equal to
zero.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory exists to initialize the
barrier.</p>

<p>The pthread_barrier_init() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBUSY The implementation has detected an attempt to
reinitialize a barrier while it is in use (for example,
while being used in a pthread_barrier_wait() call) by
another thread.</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by attr is invalid.</p>

<p>These functions shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The pthread_barrier_destroy() and
pthread_barrier_init() functions are part of the Barriers
option and need not be provided on all implementa-
tions.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
