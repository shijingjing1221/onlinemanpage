<p>NAME udp - User Datagram Protocol for IPv4</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; #include
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</p>

<p>udp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This is an implementation of the User
Datagram Protocol described in RFC 768. It implements a
connectionless, unreliable datagram packet service. Packets
may be reordered or duplicated before they arrive. UDP
generates and checks checksums to catch transmission
errors.</p>

<p>When a UDP socket is created, its local and remote
addresses are unspecified. Datagrams can be sent immediately
using sendto(2) or sendmsg(2) with a valid destination
address as an argument. When con- nect(2) is called on the
socket, the default destination address is set and datagrams
can now be sent using send(2) or write(2) without speci-
fying a destination address. It is still possible to send to
other destinations by passing an address to sendto(2) or
sendmsg(2). In order to receive packets, the socket can be
bound to a local address first by using bind(2). Otherwise
the socket layer will automatically assign a free local port
out of the range defined by net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range and
bind the socket to INADDR_ANY.</p>

<p>All receive operations return only one packet. When the
packet is smaller than the passed buffer, only that much
data is returned; when it is bigger, the packet is truncated
and the MSG_TRUNC flag is set. MSG_WAITALL is not
supported.</p>

<p>IP options may be sent or received using the socket
options described in ip(7). They are only processed by the
kernel when the appropriate /proc parameter is enabled (but
still passed to the user even when it is turned off). See
ip(7).</p>

<p>When the MSG_DONTROUTE flag is set on sending, the
destination address must refer to a local interface address
and the packet is only sent to that interface.</p>

<p>By default, Linux UDP does path MTU (Maximum
Transmission Unit) discov- ery. This means the kernel will
keep track of the MTU to a specific target IP address and
return EMSGSIZE when a UDP packet write exceeds it. When
this happens, the application should decrease the packet
size. Path MTU discovery can be also turned off using the
IP_MTU_DIS- COVER socket option or the
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc file; see ip(7) for
details. When turned off, UDP will fragment outgoing UDP
packets that exceed the interface MTU. However, disabling it
is not recommended for performance and reliability
reasons.</p>

<p>Address Format UDP uses the IPv4 sockaddr_in address
format described in ip(7).</p>

<p>Error Handling All fatal errors will be passed to the
user as an error return even when the socket is not
connected. This includes asynchronous errors received from
the network. You may get an error for an earlier packet that
was sent on the same socket. This behavior differs from many
other BSD socket implementations which don t pass any errors
unless the socket is connected. Linuxs behavior is mandated
by RFC 1122.</p>

<p>For compatibility with legacy code, in Linux 2.0 and 2.2
it was possi- ble to set the SO_BSDCOMPAT SOL_SOCKET option
to receive remote errors only when the socket has been
connected (except for EPROTO and EMSG- SIZE). Locally
generated errors are always passed. Support for this socket
option was removed in later kernels; see socket(7) for
further information.</p>

<p>When the IP_RECVERR option is enabled, all errors are
stored in the socket error queue, and can be received by
recvmsg(2) with the MSG_ERRQUEUE flag set.</p>

<p>/proc interfaces System-wide UDP parameter settings can
be accessed by files in the directory
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/.</p>

<p>udp_mem (since Linux 2.6.25) This is a vector of three
integers governing the number of pages allowed for queueing
by all UDP sockets.</p>

<p>min Below this number of pages, UDP is not bothered
about its memory appetite. When the amount of memory allo-
cated by UDP exceeds this number, UDP starts to moder- ate
memory usage.</p>

<p>pressure This value was introduced to follow the format
of tcp_mem (see tcp(7)).</p>

<p>max Number of pages allowed for queueing by all UDP
sock- ets.</p>

<p>Defaults values for these three items are calculated at
boot time from the amount of available memory.</p>

<p>udp_rmem_min (integer; default value: PAGE_SIZE; since
Linux 2.6.25) Minimal size, in bites, of receive buffer used
by UDP sockets in moderation. Each UDP socket is able to use
the size for receiv- ing data, even if total pages of UDP
sockets exceed udp_mem pressure.</p>

<p>udp_wmem_min (integer; default value: PAGE_SIZE; since
Linux 2.6.25) Minimal size, in bytes, of send buffer used by
UDP sockets in moderation. Each UDP socket is able to use
the size for sending data, even if total pages of UDP
sockets exceed udp_mem pres- sure.</p>

<p>Socket Options To set or get a UDP socket option, call
getsockopt(2) to read or set- sockopt(2) to write the option
with the option level argument set to IPPROTO_UDP.</p>

<p>UDP_CORK (since Linux 2.5.44) If this option is enabled,
then all data output on this socket is accumulated into a
single datagram that is transmitted when the option is
disabled. This option should not be used in code intended to
be portable.</p>

<p>Ioctls These ioctls can be accessed using ioctl(2). The
correct syntax is:</p>

<p>int value; error = ioctl(udp_socket, ioctl_type,
&amp;value);</p>

<p>FIONREAD (SIOCINQ) Gets a pointer to an integer as
argument. Returns the size of the next pending datagram in
the integer in bytes, or 0 when no datagram is pending.</p>

<p>TIOCOUTQ (SIOCOUTQ) Returns the number of data bytes in
the local send queue. Only supported with Linux 2.4 and
above.</p>

<p>In addition all ioctls documented in ip(7) and socket(7)
are supported.</p>

<p>ERRORS All errors documented for socket(7) or ip(7) may
be returned by a send or receive on a UDP socket.</p>

<p>ECONNREFUSED No receiver was associated with the
destination address. This might be caused by a previous
packet sent over the socket.</p>

<p>VERSIONS IP_RECVERR is a new feature in Linux 2.2.</p>
