<p>NAME hd - MFM/IDE hard disk devices</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The hd* devices are block devices to access
MFM/IDE hard disk drives in raw mode. The master drive on
the primary IDE controller (major device number 3) is hda;
the slave drive is hdb. The master drive of the sec- ond
controller (major device number 22) is hdc and the slave
hdd.</p>

<p>General IDE block device names have the form hdX, or
hdXP, where X is a letter denoting the physical drive, and P
is a number denoting the par- tition on that physical drive.
The first form, hdX, is used to address the whole drive.
Partition numbers are assigned in the order the par- titions
are discovered, and only non-empty, non-extended partitions
get a number. However, partition numbers 1-4 are given to
the four parti- tions described in the MBR (the
&quot;primary&quot; partitions), regardless of whether they
are unused or extended. Thus, the first logical partition
will be hdX5. Both DOS-type partitioning and BSD-disklabel
partition- ing are supported. You can have at most 63
partitions on an IDE disk.</p>

<p>For example, /dev/hda refers to all of the first IDE
drive in the sys- tem; and /dev/hdb3 refers to the third DOS
&quot;primary&quot; partition on the second one.</p>

<p>They are typically created by:</p>

<p>mknod -m 660 /dev/hda b 3 0 mknod -m 660 /dev/hda1 b 3 1
mknod -m 660 /dev/hda2 b 3 2 ... mknod -m 660 /dev/hda8 b 3
8 mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb b 3 64 mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb1 b 3 65
mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb2 b 3 66 ... mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb8 b 3
72 chown root:disk /dev/hd*</p>

<p>FILES /dev/hd*</p>
