<p>PCP(1) PCP(1)</p>

<p>NAME pcp - run a command or summarize an
installation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pcp [pcp options...] pcp-command [command
options...] pcp [-P] [-a archive] [-h host] [-n
pmnsfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pcp command is used in one of two modes.
By default, it summarizes the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
installation on the local host. This mode can also be used
to summarize the installation from a remote host, or a
historical installation from a PCP archive.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a command can be passed to pcp to run,
again possibly in the context of a remote host or historical
archive.</p>

<p>COMMAND MODE When pcp is invoked with a command to run,
it will search for the named command in $PCP_BINADM_DIR and
also $HOME/.pcp/bin (these are usually scripts, and are
installed with a &quot;pcp-&quot; prefix). This mode of
opera- tion allows system performance tools to be
implemented using PMAPI(3) services, while still preserving
all of their usual command line options. These options are
thus (indirectly) augmented with the stan- dard PCP option
set, as described in PCPIntro(1).</p>

<p>This provides a convenient mechanism for obtaining
retrospective or remote monitoring capabilities while
preserving the behaviour of the system tools.</p>

<p>For example, the pcp-free(1) utility can be invoked as
follows, for recorded data from host munch:</p>

<p>$ pcp -a $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/munch/20140317 -O
11:35:50am free -m total used free shared buffers cached
Mem: 23960 14554 9406 0 176 2137 -/+ buffers/cache: 12240
11720 Swap 12047 0 12047</p>

<p>A complete list of the available and installed tools is
provided along with the pcp(1) usage message, but some
examples include: pcp-free(1), pcp-uptime(1) and
pcp-numastat(1).</p>

<p>SUMMARY MODE The summary report includes: the OS
version, a summary of the hardware inventory, the local
timezone, the PCP software version, the state of the pmcd(1)
process and associated Performance Metrics Domain Agents
(PMDAs), as well as information about any PCP archive
loggers (pmlog- ger(1)) and PCP inference engines (pmie(1))
that are running.</p>

<p>With no arguments, pcp reports on the local host,
however the following options are accepted:</p>

<p>-a archive Report the PCP configuration as described in
the PCP archive log archive.</p>

<p>-h host Report the PCP configuration on host rather than
the local host.</p>

<p>-n pmnsfile Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name
Space (pmns(5)) from the file pmnsfile.</p>

<p>-P Display pmie performance information - counts of
rules evaluat- ing to true, false, or indeterminate, as well
as the expected rate of rule calculation, for each pmie
process running on the default host. Refer to the individual
metric help text for full details on these values.</p>

<p>All of the displayed values are performance metric
values and further information for each can be obtained
using the command:</p>

<p>$ pminfo -dtT metric</p>

<p>The complete set of metrics required by pcp to produce
its output is contained in
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/tools/pcp-summary.</p>

<p>FILES $HOME/.pcp/bin Per-user location for command
scripts. $PCP_BINADM_DIR System location for installed
command scripts.
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/tools/pcp-summary pmlogconf(1)
configuration file for collecting all of the metrics
required by pcp.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO PCPIntro(1), pcp-free(1), pcp-uptime(1),
pcp-numastat(1), pmcd(1), pmie(1), pmlogconf(1),
pmlogger(1), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS pcp will terminate with an exit status of 1
if pmcd on the target host could not be reached or the
archive could not be opened, or 2 for any other error.</p>
