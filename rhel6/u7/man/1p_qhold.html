<p>QHOLD(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual QHOLD(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME qhold - hold batch jobs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS qhold [-h hold_list] job_identifier ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A hold is placed on a batch job by a request
to the batch server that manages the batch job. A batch job
that has one or more holds is not eligible for execution.
The qhold utility is a user-accessible client of batch
services that requests one or more types of hold to be
placed on one or more batch jobs.</p>

<p>The qhold utility shall place holds on those batch jobs
for which a batch job_identifier is presented to the
utility.</p>

<p>The qhold utility shall place holds on batch jobs in the
order in which their batch job_identifiers are presented to
the utility. If the qhold utility fails to process any batch
job_identifier successfully, the utility shall proceed to
process the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p>The qhold utility shall place holds on each batch job by
sending a Hold Job Request to the batch server that manages
the batch job.</p>

<p>The qhold utility shall not exit until holds have been
placed on the batch job corresponding to each successfully
processed batch job_iden- tifier.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The qhold utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following option shall be supported by the
implementation:</p>

<p>-h hold_list Define the types of holds to be placed on
the batch job.</p>

<p>The qhold -h option shall accept a value for the
hold_list option-argu- ment that is a string of alphanumeric
characters in the portable char- acter set (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set).</p>

<p>The qhold utility shall accept a value for the hold_list
option-argu- ment that is a string of one or more of the
charactersu ,, or , or the single charactern.</p>

<p>For each unique character in the hold_list
option-argument, the qhold utility shall add a value to the
Hold_Types attribute of the batch job as follows, each
representing a different hold type:</p>

<p>u USER</p>

<p>s SYSTEM</p>

<p>o OPERATOR</p>

<p>If any of these characters are duplicated in the
hold_list option-argu- ment, the duplicates shall be
ignored.</p>

<p>An existing Hold_Types attribute can be cleared by the
following hold type:</p>

<p>n NO_HOLD</p>

<p>The qhold utility shall consider it an error if any hold
type other thannis combined with hold typen.</p>

<p>Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of
the characters ,,, ornwithin the hold_list option-argument.
The qhold utility shall permit the repetition of characters,
but shall not assign additional meaning to the repeated
characters.</p>

<p>An implementation may define other hold types. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe
any additional hold types, how they are specified, their
internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the
utility.</p>

<p>If the -h option is not presented to the qhold utility,
the implementa- tion shall set the Hold_Types attribute to
USER.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The qhold utility shall accept one or more
operands that conform to the syntax for a batch
job_identifier (see Batch Job Identifier ).</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of qhold:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>LOGNAME Determine the login name of the user.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT None.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS In addition to the default
behavior, the qhold utility shall not be required to write a
diagnostic message to standard error when the error reply
received from a batch server indicates that the batch
job_identi- fier does not exist on the server. Whether or
not the qhold utility waits to output the diagnostic message
while attempting to locate the job on other servers is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The qhold utility allows users to place a hold
on one or more jobs. A hold makes a batch job ineligible for
execution.</p>

<p>The qhold utility has options that allow the user to
specify the type of hold. Should the user wish to place a
hold on a set of jobs that meet a selection criteria, such a
list of jobs can be acquired using the qselect utility.</p>

<p>The -h option allows the user to specify the type of
hold that is to be placed on the job. This option allows for
USER, SYSTEM, OPERATOR, and implementation-defined hold
types. The USER and OPERATOR holds are dis- tinct. The batch
server that manages the batch job will verify that the user
is authorized to set the specified hold for the batch
job.</p>

<p>Mail is not required on hold because the administrator
has the tools and libraries to build this option if he or
she wishes.</p>

<p>Historically, the qhold utility has been a part of some
existing batch systems, although it has not traditionally
been a part of the NQS.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
