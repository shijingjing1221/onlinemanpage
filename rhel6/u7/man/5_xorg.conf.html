<p>NAME xorg.conf, xorg.conf.d - configuration files for
Xorg X server</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION Xorg supports several mechanisms for
supplying/obtaining configuration and run-time parameters:
command line options, environment variables, the xorg.conf
and xorg.conf.d configuration files, auto-detection, and
fallback defaults. When the same information is supplied in
more than one way, the highest precedence mechanism is used.
The list of mecha- nisms is ordered from highest precedence
to lowest. Note that not all parameters can be supplied via
all methods. The available command line options and
environment variables (and some defaults) are described in
the Xserver(1) and Xorg(1) manual pages. Most configuration
file param- eters, with their defaults, are described below.
Driver and module spe- cific configuration parameters are
described in the relevant driver or module manual page.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xorg uses a configuration file called
xorg.conf and files ending in the suffix .conf from the
directory xorg.conf.d for its initial setup. The xorg.conf
configuration file is searched for in the following places
when the server is started as a normal user:</p>

<p>/etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt; /usr/etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG /usr/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG
/etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/xorg.conf
/usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
/usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf
/usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
/usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf</p>

<p>where &lt;cmdline&gt; is a relative path (with no ..
components) specified with the -config command line option,
$XORGCONFIG is the relative path (with no .. components)
specified by that environment variable, and &lt;hostname&gt;
is the machine s hostname as reported by gethostname(3).</p>

<p>When the Xorg server is started by the root user, the
config file search locations are as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;cmdline&gt; /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
/usr/etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt; $XORGCONFIG
/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG /usr/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG
/etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/xorg.conf
/usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
/usr/etc/X11/xorg.conf
/usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.&lt;hostname&gt;
/usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf</p>

<p>where &lt;cmdline&gt; is the path specified with the
-config command line option (which may be absolute or
relative), $XORGCONFIG is the path specified by that
environment variable (absolute or relative), $HOME is the
path specified by that environment variable (usually the
home directory), and &lt;hostname&gt; is the machines
hostname as reported by gethostname(3).</p>

<p>Additional configuration files are searched for in the
following direc- tories when the server is started as a
normal user:</p>

<p>/etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt; /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d</p>

<p>where &lt;cmdline&gt; is a relative path (with no ..
components) specified with the -configdir command line
option.</p>

<p>When the Xorg server is started by the root user, the
config direc- tory search locations are as follows:</p>

<p>&lt;cmdline&gt; /etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt;
/etc/X11/&lt;cmdline&gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d</p>

<p>where &lt;cmdline&gt; is the path specified with the
-configdir command line option (which may be absolute or
relative).</p>

<p>Finally, configuration files will also be searched for
in directories reserved for system use. These are to
separate configuration files from the vendor or 3rd party
packages from those of local administration. These files are
found in the following directories:</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d</p>

<p>The xorg.conf and xorg.conf.d files are composed of a
number of sec- tions which may be present in any order, or
omitted to use default con- figuration values. Each section
has the form:</p>

<p>Section &quot;SectionName&quot; SectionEntry ...
EndSection</p>

<p>The section names are:</p>

<p>Files File pathnames ServerFlags Server flags Module
Dynamic module loading Extensions Extension enabling
InputDevice Input device description InputClass Input class
description Device Graphics device description VideoAdaptor
Xv video adaptor description Monitor Monitor description
Modes Video modes descriptions Screen Screen configuration
ServerLayout Overall layout DRI DRI-specific configuration
Vendor Vendor-specific configuration</p>

<p>The following obsolete section names are still
recognised for compati- bility purposes. In new config
files, the InputDevice section should be used instead.</p>

<p>Keyboard Keyboard configuration Pointer Pointer/mouse
configuration</p>

<p>The old XInput section is no longer recognised.</p>

<p>The ServerLayout sections are at the highest level. They
bind together the input and output devices that will be used
in a session. The input devices are described in the
InputDevice sections. Output devices usu- ally consist of
multiple independent components (e.g., a graphics board and
a monitor). These multiple components are bound together in
the Screen sections, and it is these that are referenced by
the ServerLay- out section. Each Screen section binds
together a graphics board and a monitor. The graphics boards
are described in the Device sections, and the monitors are
described in the Monitor sections.</p>

<p>Config file keywords are case-insensitive, and _
characters are ignored. Most strings (including Option
names) are also case-insensi- tive, and insensitive to white
space and _ characters.</p>

<p>Each config file entry usually takes up a single line in
the file. They consist of a keyword, which is possibly
followed by one or more arguments, with the number and types
of the arguments depending on the keyword. The argument
types are:</p>

<p>Integer an integer number in decimal, hex or octal Real
a floating point number String a string enclosed in double
quote marks (&quot;)</p>

<p>Note: hex integer values must be prefixed with 0x, and
octal values with 0.</p>

<p>A special keyword called Option may be used to provide
free-form data to various components of the server. The
Option keyword takes either one or two string arguments. The
first is the option name, and the optional second argument
is the option value. Some commonly used option value types
include:</p>

<p>Integer an integer number in decimal, hex or octal Real
a floating point number String a sequence of characters
Boolean a boolean value (see below) Frequency a frequency
value (see below)</p>

<p>Note that all Option values, not just strings, must be
enclosed in quotes.</p>

<p>Boolean options may optionally have a value specified.
When no value is specified, the options value is TRUE. The
following boolean option values are recognised as TRUE:</p>

<p>1, on, true, yes</p>

<p>and the following boolean option values are recognised
as FALSE:</p>

<p>0, off, false, no</p>

<p>If an option name is prefixed with &quot;No&quot;, then
the option value is negated.</p>

<p>Example: the following option entries are
equivalent:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Accel&quot; &quot;Off&quot; Option
&quot;NoAccel&quot; Option &quot;NoAccel&quot;
&quot;On&quot; Option &quot;Accel&quot; &quot;false&quot;
Option &quot;Accel&quot; &quot;no&quot;</p>

<p>Frequency option values consist of a real number that is
optionally followed by one of the following frequency
units:</p>

<p>Hz, k, kHz, M, MHz</p>

<p>When the unit name is omitted, the correct units will be
determined from the value and the expectations of the
appropriate range of the value. It is recommended that the
units always be specified when using frequency option values
to avoid any errors in determining the value.</p>

<p>FILES SECTION The Files section is used to specify some
path names required by the server. Some of these paths can
also be set from the command line (see Xserver(1) and
Xorg(1)). The command line settings override the values
specified in the config file. The Files section is optional,
as are all of the entries that may appear in it.</p>

<p>The entries that can appear in this section are:</p>

<p>FontPath &quot;path&quot; sets the search path for
fonts. This path is a comma separated list of font path
elements which the Xorg server searches for font databases.
Multiple FontPath entries may be specified, and they will be
concatenated to build up the fontpath used by the server.
Font path elements can be absolute directory paths,
catalogue directories or a font server identifier. The
formats of the later two are explained below:</p>

<p>Catalogue directories:</p>

<p>Catalogue directories can be specified using the prefix
cat- alogue: before the directory name. The directory can
then be populated with symlinks pointing to the real font
directo- ries, using the following syntax in the symlink
name:</p>

<p>&lt;identifier&gt;:[attribute]:pri=&lt;priority&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;identifier&gt; is an alphanumeric identifier,
[attribute] is an attribute which will be passed to the
underlying FPE and &lt;priority&gt; is a number used to
order the fontfile FPEs. Examples:</p>

<p>75dpi:unscaled:pri=20 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi
gscript:pri=60 -&gt; /usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript
misc:unscaled:pri=10 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc</p>

<p>Font server identifiers:</p>

<p>Font server identifiers have the form:</p>

<p>&lt;trans&gt;/&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port-number&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;trans&gt; is the transport type to use to
connect to the font server (e.g., unix for UNIX-domain
sockets or tcp for a TCP/IP connection), &lt;hostname&gt; is
the hostname of the machine running the font server, and
&lt;port-number&gt; is the port number that the font server
is listening on (usually 7100).</p>

<p>When this entry is not specified in the config file, the
server falls back to the compiled-in default font path,
which contains the following font path elements (which can
be set inside a cat- alogue directory):</p>

<p>/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/ /usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF/
/usr/share/fonts/X11/OTF/ /usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1/
/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/ /usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/</p>

<p>Font path elements that are found to be invalid are
removed from the font path when the server starts up.</p>

<p>ModulePath &quot;path&quot; sets the search path for
loadable Xorg server modules. This path is a comma separated
list of directories which the Xorg server searches for
loadable modules loading in the order speci- fied. Multiple
ModulePath entries may be specified, and they will be
concatenated to build the module search path used by the
server. The default module path is</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/xorg/modules</p>

<p>XkbDir &quot;path&quot; sets the base directory for
keyboard layout files. The -xkbdir command line option can
be used to override this. The default directory is</p>

<p>/usr/share/X11/xkb</p>

<p>SERVERFLAGS SECTION In addition to options specific to
this section (described below), the ServerFlags section is
used to specify some global Xorg server options. All of the
entries in this section are Options, although for compati-
bility purposes some of the old style entries are still
recognised. Those old style entries are not documented here,
and using them is dis- couraged. The ServerFlags section is
optional, as are the entries that may be specified in
it.</p>

<p>Options specified in this section (with the exception of
the &quot;Default- ServerLayout&quot; Option) may be
overridden by Options specified in the active ServerLayout
section. Options with command line equivalents are
overridden when their command line equivalent is used. The
options recognised by this section are:</p>

<p>Option &quot;DefaultServerLayout&quot;
&quot;layout-id&quot; This specifies the default
ServerLayout section to use in the absence of the -layout
command line option.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoTrapSignals&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
This prevents the Xorg server from trapping a range of unex-
pected fatal signals and exiting cleanly. Instead, the Xorg
server will die and drop core where the fault occurred. The
default behaviour is for the Xorg server to exit cleanly,
but still drop a core file. In general you never want to use
this option unless you are debugging an Xorg server problem
and know how to deal with the consequences.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseSIGIO&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
controls whether the Xorg server requests that events from
input devices be reported via a SIGIO signal handler (also
known as SIGPOLL on some platforms), or only reported via
the standard select(3) loop. The default behaviour is
platform specific. In general you do not want to use this
option unless you are debugging the Xorg server, or working
around a specific bug until it is fixed, and understand the
consequences.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DontVTSwitch&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
disallows the use of the Ctrl+Alt+Fn sequence (where Fn
refers to one of the numbered function keys). That sequence
is normally used to switch to another &quot;virtual
terminal&quot; on operat- ing systems that have this
feature. When this option is enabled, that key sequence has
no special meaning and is passed to clients. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DontZap&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
disallows the use of the Terminate_Server XKB action (usu-
ally on Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, depending on XKB options). This
action is normally used to terminate the Xorg server. When
this option is enabled, the action has no effect. Default:
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DontZoom&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
disallows the use of the Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus and
Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus sequences. These sequences allows you
to switch between video modes. When this option is enabled,
those key sequences have no special meaning and are passed
to clients. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DisableVidModeExtension&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; This disables the parts of the VidMode
extension used by the xvidtune client that can be used to
change the video modes. Default: the VidMode extension is
enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AllowNonLocalXvidtune&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; This allows the xvidtune client (and
other clients that use the VidMode extension) to connect
from another host. Default: off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AllowMouseOpenFail&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; This tells the mousedrv(4) and
vmmouse(4) drivers to not report failure if the mouse device
can t be opened/initialised. It has no effect on the
evdev(4) or other drivers. Default: false.</p>

<p>Option &quot;BlankTime&quot; &quot;time&quot; sets the
inactivity timeout for the blank phase of the screen- saver.
time is in minutes. This is equivalent to the Xorg server s
-s flag, and the value can be changed at run-time with
xset(1). Default: 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Option &quot;StandbyTime&quot; &quot;time&quot; sets the
inactivity timeout for the standby phase of DPMS mode. time
is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time with
xset(1). Default: 10 minutes. This is only suitable for VESA
DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported by all
video drivers. It is only enabled for screens that have the
&quot;DPMS&quot; option set (see the MONITOR section
below).</p>

<p>Option &quot;SuspendTime&quot; &quot;time&quot; sets the
inactivity timeout for the suspend phase of DPMS mode. time
is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time with
xset(1). Default: 10 minutes. This is only suitable for VESA
DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported by all
video drivers. It is only enabled for screens that have the
&quot;DPMS&quot; option set (see the MONITOR section
below).</p>

<p>Option &quot;OffTime&quot; &quot;time&quot; sets the
inactivity timeout for the off phase of DPMS mode. time is
in minutes, and the value can be changed at run-time with
xset(1). Default: 10 minutes. This is only suitable for VESA
DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be supported by all
video drivers. It is only enabled for screens that have the
&quot;DPMS&quot; option set (see the MONITOR section
below).</p>

<p>Option &quot;Pixmap&quot; &quot;bpp&quot; This sets the
pixmap format to use for depth 24. Allowed values for bpp
are 24 and 32. Default: 32 unless driver constraints dont
allow this (which is rare). Note: some clients dont behave
well when this value is set to 24.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoPM&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disables
something to do with power management events. Default: PM
enabled on platforms that support it.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Xinerama&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; enable
or disable XINERAMA extension. Default is disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AIGLX&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; enable or
disable AIGLX. AIGLX is enabled by default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI2&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; enable or
disable DRI2. DRI2 is disabled by default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;GlxVisuals&quot; &quot;string&quot; This
option controls how many GLX visuals the GLX modules sets
up. The default value is typical, which will setup up a
typical subset of the GLXFBConfigs provided by the driver as
GLX visu- als. Other options are minimal, which will set up
the minimal set allowed by the GLX specification and all
which will setup GLX visuals for all GLXFBConfigs.</p>

<p>Option &quot;UseDefaultFontPath&quot;
&quot;boolean&quot; Include the default font path even if
other paths are specified in xorg.conf. If enabled, other
font paths are included as well. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;IgnoreABI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Allow
modules built for a different, potentially incompatible
version of the X server to load. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AutoAddDevices&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If
this option is disabled, then no devices will be added from
the HAL or udev backends. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AutoEnableDevices&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
If this option is disabled, then the devices will be added
(and the DevicePresenceNotify event sent), but not enabled,
thus leaving policy up to the client. Enabled by
default.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AutoAddGPU&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; If
this option is disabled, then no GPU devices will be added
from the udev backend. Enabled by default. (May need to be
dis- abled to setup Xinerama).</p>

<p>Option &quot;Log&quot; &quot;string&quot; This option
controls whether the log is flushed and/or synced to disk
after each message. Possible values are flush or sync. Unset
by default.</p>

<p>MODULE SECTION The Module section is used to specify
which Xorg server modules should be loaded. This section is
ignored when the Xorg server is built in static form. The
type of modules normally loaded in this section are Xorg
server extension modules. Most other module types are loaded
automatically when they are needed via other mechanisms. The
Module section is optional, as are all of the entries that
may be specified in it.</p>

<p>Entries in this section may be in two forms. The first
and most com- monly used form is an entry that uses the Load
keyword, as described here:</p>

<p>Load &quot;modulename&quot; This instructs the server to
load the module called modulename. The module name given
should be the module s standard name, not the module file
name. The standard name is case-sensitive, and does not
include the lib or cyg prefixes, or the .so or .dll
suffixes.</p>

<p>Example: the DRI extension module can be loaded with the
following entry:</p>

<p>Load &quot;dri&quot;</p>

<p>Disable &quot;modulename&quot; This instructs the server
to not load the module called module- name. Some modules are
loaded by default in the server, and this overrides that
default. If a Load instruction is given for the same module,
it overrides the Disable instruction and the module is
loaded. The module name given should be the modules standard
name, not the module file name. As with the Load
instruction, the standard name is case-sensitive, and does
not include the &quot;lib&quot; prefix, or the
&quot;.a&quot;, &quot;.o&quot;, or &quot;.so&quot;
suffixes.</p>

<p>The second form of entry is a SubSection, with the
subsection name being the module name, and the contents of
the SubSection being Options that are passed to the module
when it is loaded.</p>

<p>Example: the extmod module (which contains a
miscellaneous group of server extensions) can be loaded,
with the XFree86-DGA extension dis- abled by using the
following entry:</p>

<p>SubSection &quot;extmod&quot; Option &quot;omit
XFree86-DGA&quot; EndSubSection</p>

<p>Modules are searched for in each directory specified in
the ModulePath search path, and in the drivers, extensions,
input, internal, and mul- timedia subdirectories of each of
those directories. In addition to this, operating system
specific subdirectories of all the above are searched first
if they exist.</p>

<p>To see what extension modules are available, check the
extensions sub- directory under:</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/xorg/modules</p>

<p>The extmod, dbe, dri, dri2, glx, and record extension
mod- ules are loaded automatically, if they are present,
unless disabled with &quot;Disable&quot; entries. It is
recommended that at very least the extmod extension module
be loaded. If it isnt, some commonly used server extensions
(like the SHAPE extension) will not be available.</p>

<p>EXTENSIONS SECTION The Extensions section is used to
specify which X11 protocol extensions should be enabled or
disabled. The Extensions section is optional, as are all of
the entries that may be specified in it.</p>

<p>Entries in this section are listed as Option statements
with the name of the extension as the first argument, and a
boolean value as the sec- ond. The extension name is
case-sensitive, and matches the form shown in the output of
&quot;Xorg -extension ?&quot;.</p>

<p>Example: the MIT-SHM extension can be disabled with the
follow- ing entry:</p>

<p>Section &quot;Extensions&quot; Option
&quot;MIT-SHM&quot; &quot;Disable&quot; EndSection</p>

<p>INPUTDEVICE SECTION The config file may have multiple
InputDevice sections. Recent X servers employ HAL or udev
backends for input device enumeration and input hotplugging.
It is usually not necessary to provide InputDevice sections
in the xorg.conf if hotplugging is in use (i.e.
AutoAddDevices is enabled). If hotplugging is enabled,
InputDevice sections using the mouse, kbd and vmmouse driver
will be ignored.</p>

<p>If hotplugging is disabled, there will normally be at
least two: one for the core (primary) keyboard and one for
the core pointer. If either of these two is missing, a
default configuration for the missing ones will be used. In
the absence of an explicitly specified core input device,
the first InputDevice marked as CorePointer (or
CoreKeyboard) is used. If there is no match there, the first
InputDevice that uses the mouse (or kbd) driver is used. The
final fallback is to use built-in default configurations.
Currently the default configuration may not work as expected
on all platforms.</p>

<p>InputDevice sections have the following format:</p>

<p>Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;name&quot; Driver &quot;inputdriver&quot; options ...
EndSection</p>

<p>The Identifier and Driver entries are required in all
InputDevice sec- tions. All other entries are optional.</p>

<p>The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this
input device. The Driver entry specifies the name of the
driver to use for this input device. When using the loadable
server, the input driver module &quot;inputdriver&quot; will
be loaded for each active InputDevice section. An
InputDevice section is considered active if it is referenced
by an active ServerLayout section, if it is referenced by
the -keyboard or -pointer command line options, or if it is
selected implicitly as the core pointer or keyboard device
in the absence of such explicit refer- ences. The most
commonly used input drivers are evdev(4) on Linux sys- tems,
and kbd(4) and mousedrv(4) on other platforms.</p>

<p>InputDevice sections recognise some driver-independent
Options, which are described here. See the individual input
driver manual pages for a description of the device-specific
options.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AutoServerLayout&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Always add the device to the ServerLayout section used by
this instance of the server. This affects implied layouts as
well as explicit layouts specified in the configuration
and/or on the command line.</p>

<p>Option &quot;CorePointer&quot; Deprecated, see
Floating</p>

<p>Option &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot; Deprecated, see
Floating</p>

<p>Option &quot;AlwaysCore&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Deprecated, see Floating</p>

<p>Option &quot;SendCoreEvents&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Deprecated, see Floating</p>

<p>Option &quot;Floating&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; When
enabled, the input device is set up floating and does not
report events through any master device or control a cursor.
The device is only available to clients using the X Input
Extension API. This option is disabled by default. The
options Core- Pointer, CoreKeyboard, AlwaysCore, and
SendCoreEvents, are the inverse of option Floating (i.e.
SendCoreEvents &quot;on&quot; is equiva- lent to Floating
&quot;off&quot; ).</p>

<p>This option controls the startup behavior only, a device
may be reattached or set floating at runtime.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TransformationMatrix&quot; &quot;a b c d e
f g h i&quot; Specifies the 3x3 transformation matrix for
absolute input devices. The input device will be bound to
the area given in the matrix. In most configurations,
&quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; specify the width and height
of the area the device is bound to, and &quot;c&quot; and
&quot;f&quot; specify the x and y offset of the area. The
value range is 0 to 1, where 1 represents the width or
height of all root windows together, 0.5 represents half the
area, etc. The values repre- sent a 3x3 matrix, with the
first, second and third group of three values representing
the first, second and third row of the matrix, respectively.
The identity matrix is &quot;1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1&quot;.</p>

<p>POINTER ACCELERATION For pointing devices, the following
options control how the pointer is accelerated or
decelerated with respect to physical device motion. Most of
these can be adjusted at runtime, see the xinput(1) man page
for details. Only the most important acceleration options
are discussed here.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelerationProfile&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Select the profile. In laymans terms,
the profile constitutes the &quot;feeling&quot; of the
acceleration. More formally, it defines how the transfer
function (actual acceleration as a function of cur- rent
device velocity and acceleration controls) is constructed.
This is mainly a matter of personal preference.</p>

<p>0 classic (mostly compatible) -1 none (only constant
deceleration is applied) 1 device-dependent 2 polynomial
(polynomial function) 3 smooth linear (soft knee, then
linear) 4 simple (normal when slow, otherwise accelerated) 5
power (power function) 6 linear (more speed, more
acceleration) 7 limited (like linear, but maxes out at
threshold)</p>

<p>Option &quot;ConstantDeceleration&quot; &quot;real&quot;
Makes the pointer go deceleration times slower than normal.
Most useful for high-resolution devices. A value between 0
and 1 will speed up the pointer.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AdaptiveDeceleration&quot; &quot;real&quot;
Allows to actually decelerate the pointer when going slow.
At most, it will be adaptive deceleration times slower.
Enables precise pointer placement without sacrificing
speed.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelerationScheme&quot; &quot;string&quot;
Selects the scheme, which is the underlying algorithm.</p>

<p>predictable default algorithm (behaving more
predictable) lightweight old acceleration code (as specified
in the X protocol spec) none no acceleration or
deceleration</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelerationNumerator&quot;
&quot;integer&quot;</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelerationDenominator&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Set numerator and denominator of the
acceleration factor. The acceleration factor is a rational
which, together with thresh- old, can be used to tweak
profiles to suit the users needs. The simple and limited
profiles use it directly (i.e. they acceler- ate by the
factor), for other profiles it should hold that a higher
acceleration factor leads to a faster pointer. Typically, 1
is unaccelerated and values up to 5 are sensible.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelerationThreshold&quot;
&quot;integer&quot; Set the threshold, which is roughly the
velocity (usually device units per 10 ms) required for
acceleration to become effective. The precise effect varies
with the profile however.</p>

<p>INPUTCLASS SECTION The config file may have multiple
InputClass sections. These sections are optional and are
used to provide configuration for a class of input devices
as they are automatically added. An input device can match
more than one InputClass section. Each class can override
settings from a previous class, so it is best to arrange the
sections with the most generic matches first.</p>

<p>InputClass sections have the following format:</p>

<p>Section &quot;InputClass&quot; Identifier
&quot;name&quot; entries ... options ... EndSection</p>

<p>The Identifier entry is required in all InputClass
sections. All other entries are optional.</p>

<p>The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this
input class. The Driver entry specifies the name of the
driver to use for this input device. After all classes have
been examined, the &quot;inputdriver&quot; module from the
first Driver entry will be enabled when using the loadable
server.</p>

<p>When an input device is automatically added, its
characteristics are checked against all InputClass sections.
Each section can contain optional entries to narrow the
match of the class. If none of the optional entries appear,
the InputClass section is generic and will match any input
device. If more than one of these entries appear, they all
must match for the configuration to apply.</p>

<p>There are two types of match entries used in InputClass
sections. The first allows various tokens to be matched
against attributes of the device. An entry can be
constructed to match attributes from different devices by
separating arguments with a | character. Multiple entries of
the same type may be supplied to add multiple matching
conditions on the same attribute. For example:</p>

<p>Section &quot;InputClass&quot; Identifier &quot;My
Class&quot; # product string must contain example and #
either gizmo or gadget MatchProduct &quot;example&quot;
MatchProduct &quot;gizmo|gadget&quot; ... EndSection</p>

<p>MatchProduct &quot;matchproduct&quot; This entry can be
used to check if the substring &quot;matchproduct&quot;
occurs in the devices product name.</p>

<p>MatchVendor &quot;matchvendor&quot; This entry can be
used to check if the substring &quot;matchvendor&quot;
occurs in the devices vendor name.</p>

<p>MatchDevicePath &quot;matchdevice&quot; This entry can
be used to check if the device file matches the
&quot;matchdevice&quot; pathname pattern.</p>

<p>MatchOS &quot;matchos&quot; This entry can be used to
check if the operating system matches the case-insensitive
&quot;matchos&quot; string. This entry is only sup- ported
on platforms providing the uname(2) system call.</p>

<p>MatchPnPID &quot;matchpnp&quot; The devices Plug and
Play (PnP) ID can be checked against the
&quot;matchpnp&quot; shell wildcard pattern.</p>

<p>MatchUSBID &quot;matchusb&quot; The devices USB ID can
be checked against the &quot;matchusb&quot; shell wildcard
pattern. The ID is constructed as lowercase hexadecimal
numbers separated by a : . This is the same format as the
lsusb(8) program.</p>

<p>MatchDriver &quot;matchdriver&quot; Check the
case-sensitive string &quot;matchdriver&quot; against the
cur- rently configured driver of the device. Ordering of
sections using this entry is important since it will not
match unless the driver has been set by the config backend
or a previous Input- Class section.</p>

<p>MatchTag &quot;matchtag&quot; This entry can be used to
check if tags assigned by the config backend matches the
&quot;matchtag&quot; pattern. A match is found if at least
one of the tags given in &quot;matchtag&quot; matches at
least one of the tags assigned by the backend.</p>

<p>MatchLayout &quot;matchlayout&quot; Check the
case-sensitive string &quot;matchlayout&quot; against the
cur- rently active ServerLayout section. The empty string
&quot;&quot; matches an implicit layout which appears if no
named ServerLayout sec- tions have been found.</p>

<p>The second type of entry is used to match device types.
These entries take a boolean argument similar to Option
entries.</p>

<p>MatchIsKeyboard &quot;bool&quot;</p>

<p>MatchIsPointer &quot;bool&quot;</p>

<p>MatchIsJoystick &quot;bool&quot;</p>

<p>MatchIsTablet &quot;bool&quot;</p>

<p>MatchIsTouchpad &quot;bool&quot;</p>

<p>MatchIsTouchscreen &quot;bool&quot;</p>

<p>When an input device has been matched to the InputClass
section, any Option entries are applied to the device. One
InputClass specific Option is recognized. See the
InputDevice section above for a descrip- tion of the
remaining Option entries.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Ignore&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
optional entry specifies that the device should be ignored
entirely, and not added to the server. This can be useful
when the device is handled by another program and no X
events should be generated.</p>

<p>DEVICE SECTION The config file may have multiple Device
sections. There must be at least one, for the video card
being used.</p>

<p>Device sections have the following format:</p>

<p>Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier &quot;name&quot;
Driver &quot;driver&quot; entries ... EndSection</p>

<p>The Identifier and Driver entries are required in all
Device sections. All other entries are optional.</p>

<p>The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this
graphics device. The Driver entry specifies the name of the
driver to use for this graphics device. When using the
loadable server, the driver mod- ule &quot;driver&quot; will
be loaded for each active Device section. A Device section
is considered active if it is referenced by an active Screen
section.</p>

<p>Device sections recognise some driver-independent
entries and Options, which are described here. Not all
drivers make use of these driver-independent entries, and
many of those that do dont require them to be specified
because the information is auto-detected. See the individual
graphics driver manual pages for further information about
this, and for a description of the device-specific options.
Note that most of the Options listed here (but not the other
entries) may be specified in the Screen section instead of
here in the Device section.</p>

<p>BusID &quot;bus-id&quot; This specifies the bus location
of the graphics card. For PCI/AGP cards, the bus-id string
has the form PCI:bus:device:function (e.g., PCI:1:0:0 might
be appropriate for an AGP card). This field is usually
optional in single-head configurations when using the
primary graphics card. In multi- head configurations, or
when using a secondary graphics card in a single-head
configuration, this entry is mandatory. Its main purpose is
to make an unambiguous connection between the device section
and the hardware it is representing. This information can
usually be found by running the pciaccess tool scanpci.</p>

<p>Screen number This option is mandatory for cards where a
single PCI entity can drive more than one display (i.e.,
multiple CRTCs sharing a sin- gle graphics accelerator and
video memory). One Device section is required for each head,
and this parameter determines which head each of the Device
sections applies to. The legal values of number range from 0
to one less than the total number of heads per entity. Most
drivers require that the primary screen (0) be present.</p>

<p>Chipset &quot;chipset&quot; This usually optional entry
specifies the chipset used on the graphics board. In most
cases this entry is not required because the drivers will
probe the hardware to determine the chipset type. Don t
specify it unless the driver-specific docu- mentation
recommends that you do.</p>

<p>Ramdac &quot;ramdac-type&quot; This optional entry
specifies the type of RAMDAC used on the graphics board.
This is only used by a few of the drivers, and in most cases
it is not required because the drivers will probe the
hardware to determine the RAMDAC type where possible. Dont
specify it unless the driver-specific documentation
recommends that you do.</p>

<p>DacSpeed speed</p>

<p>DacSpeed speed-8 speed-16 speed-24 speed-32 This
optional entry specifies the RAMDAC speed rating (which is
usually printed on the RAMDAC chip). The speed is in MHz.
When one value is given, it applies to all framebuffer pixel
sizes. When multiple values are given, they apply to the
framebuffer pixel sizes 8, 16, 24 and 32 respectively. This
is not used by many drivers, and only needs to be specified
when the speed rat- ing of the RAMDAC is different from the
defaults built in to driver, or when the driver can t
auto-detect the correct defaults. Don t specify it unless
the driver-specific documen- tation recommends that you
do.</p>

<p>Clocks clock ... specifies the pixel that are on your
graphics board. The clocks are in MHz, and may be specified
as a floating point number. The value is stored internally
to the nearest kHz. The ordering of the clocks is important.
It must match the order in which they are selected on the
graphics board. Multiple Clocks lines may be specified, and
each is concatenated to form the list. Most drivers do not
use this entry, and it is only required for some older
boards with non-programmable clocks. Dont specify this entry
unless the driver-specific documentation explicitly
recommends that you do.</p>

<p>ClockChip &quot;clockchip-type&quot; This optional entry
is used to specify the clock chip type on graphics boards
which have a programmable clock generator. Only a few Xorg
drivers support programmable clock chips. For details, see
the appropriate driver manual page.</p>

<p>VideoRam mem This optional entry specifies the amount of
video ram that is installed on the graphics board. This is
measured in kBytes. In most cases this is not required
because the Xorg server probes the graphics board to
determine this quantity. The driver-specific documentation
should indicate when it might be needed.</p>

<p>BiosBase baseaddress This optional entry specifies the
base address of the video BIOS for the VGA board. This
address is normally auto-detected, and should only be
specified if the driver-specific documentation recommends
it.</p>

<p>MemBase baseaddress This optional entry specifies the
memory base address of a graphics boards linear frame
buffer. This entry is not used by many drivers, and it
should only be specified if the driver-spe- cific
documentation recommends it.</p>

<p>IOBase baseaddress This optional entry specifies the IO
base address. This entry is not used by many drivers, and it
should only be specified if the driver-specific
documentation recommends it.</p>

<p>ChipID id This optional entry specifies a numerical ID
representing the chip type. For PCI cards, it is usually the
device ID. This can be used to override the auto-detection,
but that should only be done when the driver-specific
documentation recommends it.</p>

<p>ChipRev rev This optional entry specifies the chip
revision number. This can be used to override the
auto-detection, but that should only be done when the
driver-specific documentation recommends it.</p>

<p>TextClockFreq freq This optional entry specifies the
pixel clock frequency that is used for the regular text
mode. The frequency is specified in MHz. This is rarely
used.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ModeDebug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable
printing of additional debugging information about mode-
setting to the server log.</p>

<p>Options Option flags may be specified in the Device
sections. These include driver-specific options and
driver-independent options. The former are described in the
driver-specific documentation. Some of the latter are
described below in the section about the Screen section, and
they may also be included here.</p>

<p>VIDEOADAPTOR SECTION Nobody wants to say how this works.
Maybe nobody knows ...</p>

<p>MONITOR SECTION The config file may have multiple
Monitor sections. There should nor- mally be at least one,
for the monitor being used, but a default con- figuration
will be created when one isnt specified.</p>

<p>Monitor sections have the following format:</p>

<p>Section &quot;Monitor&quot; Identifier &quot;name&quot;
entries ... EndSection</p>

<p>The only mandatory entry in a Monitor section is the
Identifier entry.</p>

<p>The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this
monitor. The Monitor section may be used to provide
information about the specifica- tions of the monitor,
monitor-specific Options, and information about the video
modes to use with the monitor.</p>

<p>With RandR 1.2-enabled drivers, monitor sections may be
tied to spe- cific outputs of the video card. Using the name
of the output defined by the video driver plus the
identifier of a monitor section, one asso- ciates a monitor
section with an output by adding an option to the Device
section in the following format:</p>

<p>Option &quot;Monitor-outputname&quot;
&quot;monitorsection&quot;</p>

<p>(for example, Option &quot;Monitor-VGA&quot; &quot;VGA
monitor&quot; for a VGA output)</p>

<p>In the absence of specific association of monitor
sections to outputs, if a monitor section is present the
server will associate it with an output to preserve
compatibility for previous single-head configura- tions.</p>

<p>Specifying video modes is optional because the server
will use the DDC or other information provided by the
monitor to automatically configure the list of modes
available. When modes are specified explicitly in the
Monitor section (with the Mode, ModeLine, or UseModes
keywords), built-in modes with the same names are not
included. Built-in modes with different names are, however,
still implicitly included, when they meet the requirements
of the monitor.</p>

<p>The entries that may be used in Monitor sections are
described below.</p>

<p>VendorName &quot;vendor&quot; This optional entry
specifies the monitor s manufacturer.</p>

<p>ModelName &quot;model&quot; This optional entry
specifies the monitors model.</p>

<p>HorizSync horizsync-range gives the range(s) of
horizontal sync frequencies supported by the monitor.
horizsync-range may be a comma separated list of either
discrete values or ranges of values. A range of values is
two values separated by a dash. By default the values are in
units of kHz. They may be specified in MHz or Hz if MHz or
Hz is added to the end of the line. The data given here is
used by the Xorg server to determine if video modes are
within the spec- ifications of the monitor. This information
should be available in the monitor s handbook. If this entry
is omitted, a default range of 28-33kHz is used.</p>

<p>VertRefresh vertrefresh-range gives the range(s) of
vertical refresh frequencies supported by the monitor.
vertrefresh-range may be a comma separated list of either
discrete values or ranges of values. A range of values is
two values separated by a dash. By default the values are in
units of Hz. They may be specified in MHz or kHz if MHz or
kHz is added to the end of the line. The data given here is
used by the Xorg server to determine if video modes are
within the spec- ifications of the monitor. This information
should be available in the monitor s handbook. If this entry
is omitted, a default range of 43-72Hz is used.</p>

<p>DisplaySize width height This optional entry gives the
width and height, in millimetres, of the picture area of the
monitor. If given this is used to calculate the horizontal
and vertical pitch (DPI) of the screen.</p>

<p>Gamma gamma-value</p>

<p>Gamma red-gamma green-gamma blue-gamma This is an
optional entry that can be used to specify the gamma
correction for the monitor. It may be specified as either a
single value or as three separate RGB values. The values
should be in the range 0.1 to 10.0, and the default is 1.0.
Not all drivers are capable of using this information.</p>

<p>UseModes &quot;modesection-id&quot; Include the set of
modes listed in the Modes section called mod- esection-id.
This makes all of the modes defined in that sec- tion
available for use by this monitor.</p>

<p>Mode &quot;name&quot; This is an optional multi-line
entry that can be used to provide definitions for video
modes for the monitor. In most cases this isnt necessary
because the built-in set of VESA standard modes will be
sufficient. The Mode keyword indicates the start of a
multi-line video mode description. The mode description is
ter- minated with the EndMode keyword. The mode description
consists of the following entries:</p>

<p>DotClock clock is the dot (pixel) clock rate to be used
for the mode.</p>

<p>HTimings hdisp hsyncstart hsyncend htotal specifies the
horizontal timings for the mode.</p>

<p>VTimings vdisp vsyncstart vsyncend vtotal specifies the
vertical timings for the mode.</p>

<p>Flags &quot;flag&quot; ... specifies an optional set of
mode flags, each of which is a separate string in double
quotes. &quot;Interlace&quot; indicates that the mode is
interlaced. &quot;DoubleScan&quot; indicates a mode where
each scanline is doubled. &quot;+HSync&quot; and
&quot;-HSync&quot; can be used to select the polarity of the
HSync signal. &quot;+VSync&quot; and &quot;-VSync&quot; can
be used to select the polarity of the VSync signal.
&quot;Composite&quot; can be used to specify com- posite
sync on hardware where this is supported. Addition- ally, on
some hardware, &quot;+CSync&quot; and &quot;-CSync&quot; may
be used to select the composite sync polarity.</p>

<p>HSkew hskew specifies the number of pixels (towards the
right edge of the screen) by which the display enable signal
is to be skewed. Not all drivers use this information. This
option might become necessary to override the default value
sup- plied by the server (if any). Roving horizontal lines
indicate this value needs to be increased. If the last few
pixels on a scan line appear on the left of the screen, this
value should be decreased.</p>

<p>VScan vscan specifies the number of times each scanline
is painted on the screen. Not all drivers use this
information. Values less than 1 are treated as 1, which is
the default. Gener- ally, the &quot;DoubleScan&quot; Flag
mentioned above doubles this value.</p>

<p>ModeLine &quot;name&quot; mode-description This entry is
a more compact version of the Mode entry, and it also can be
used to specify video modes for the monitor. This is a
single line format for specifying video modes. In most cases
this isnt necessary because the built-in set of VESA
standard modes will be sufficient.</p>

<p>The mode-description is in four sections, the first
three of which are mandatory. The first is the dot (pixel)
clock. This is a single number specifying the pixel clock
rate for the mode in MHz. The second section is a list of
four numbers specifying the horizontal timings. These
numbers are the hdisp, hsync- start, hsyncend, and htotal
values. The third section is a list of four numbers
specifying the vertical timings. These numbers are the
vdisp, vsyncstart, vsyncend, and vtotal values. The final
section is a list of flags specifying other characteris-
tics of the mode. Interlace indicates that the mode is
inter- laced. DoubleScan indicates a mode where each
scanline is dou- bled. +HSync and -HSync can be used to
select the polarity of the HSync signal. +VSync and -VSync
can be used to select the polarity of the VSync signal.
Composite can be used to specify composite sync on hardware
where this is supported. Addition- ally, on some hardware,
+CSync and -CSync may be used to select the composite sync
polarity. The HSkew and VScan options men- tioned above in
the Mode entry description can also be used here.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DPMS&quot; &quot;bool&quot; This option
controls whether the server should enable the DPMS extension
for power management for this screen. The default is to
enable the extension.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SyncOnGreen&quot; &quot;bool&quot; This
option controls whether the video card should drive the sync
signal on the green color pin. Not all cards support this
option, and most monitors do not require it. The default is
off.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Primary&quot; &quot;bool&quot; This
optional entry specifies that the monitor should be treated
as the primary monitor. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers
only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;PreferredMode&quot; &quot;name&quot; This
optional entry specifies a mode to be marked as the pre-
ferred initial mode of the monitor. (RandR 1.2-supporting
drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZoomModes&quot; &quot;name name ...&quot;
This optional entry specifies modes to be marked as zoom
modes. It is possible to switch to the next and previous
mode via Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus and Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus. All
these key- pad available modes are selected from the screen
mode list. This list is a copy of the compatibility output
monitor mode list. Since this output is the output connected
to the lowest dot-area monitor, as determined from its
largest size mode, that monitor defines the available zoom
modes. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;Position&quot; &quot;x y&quot; This
optional entry specifies the position of the monitor within
the X screen. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;LeftOf&quot; &quot;output&quot; This
optional entry specifies that the monitor should be posi-
tioned to the left of the output (not monitor) of the given
name. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;RightOf&quot; &quot;output&quot; This
optional entry specifies that the monitor should be posi-
tioned to the right of the output (not monitor) of the given
name. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;Above&quot; &quot;output&quot; This
optional entry specifies that the monitor should be posi-
tioned above the output (not monitor) of the given name.
(RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;Below&quot; &quot;output&quot; This
optional entry specifies that the monitor should be posi-
tioned below the output (not monitor) of the given name.
(RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;Enable&quot; &quot;bool&quot; This optional
entry specifies whether the monitor should be turned on at
startup. By default, the server will attempt to enable all
connected monitors. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;DefaultModes&quot; &quot;bool&quot; This
optional entry specifies whether the server should add sup-
ported default modes to the list of modes offered on this
moni- tor. By default, the server will add default modes;
you should only disable this if you can guarantee that EDID
will be avail- able at all times, or if you have added
custom modelines which the server can use. (RandR
1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;MinClock&quot; &quot;frequency&quot; This
optional entry specifies the minimum dot clock, in kHz, that
is supported by the monitor.</p>

<p>Option &quot;MaxClock&quot; &quot;frequency&quot; This
optional entry specifies the maximum dot clock, in kHz, that
is supported by the monitor.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Ignore&quot; &quot;bool&quot; This optional
entry specifies that the monitor should be ignored entirely,
and not reported through RandR. This is useful if the
hardware reports the presence of outputs that dont exist.
(RandR 1.2-supporting drivers only)</p>

<p>Option &quot;Rotate&quot; &quot;rotation&quot; This
optional entry specifies the initial rotation of the given
monitor. Valid values for rotation are &quot;normal&quot;,
&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, and
&quot;inverted&quot;. (RandR 1.2-supporting drivers
only)</p>

<p>MODES SECTION The config file may have multiple Modes
sections, or none. These sec- tions provide a way of
defining sets of video modes independently of the Monitor
sections. Monitor sections may include the definitions
provided in these sections by using the UseModes keyword. In
most cases the Modes sections are not necessary because the
built-in set of VESA standard modes will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Modes sections have the following format:</p>

<p>Section &quot;Modes&quot; Identifier &quot;name&quot;
entries ... EndSection</p>

<p>The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this
set of mode descriptions. The other entries permitted in
Modes sections are the Mode and ModeLine entries that are
described above in the Monitor sec- tion.</p>

<p>SCREEN SECTION The config file may have multiple Screen
sections. There must be at least one, for the screen being
used. A screen represents the binding of a graphics device
(Device section) and a monitor (Monitor section). A Screen
section is considered active if it is referenced by an
active ServerLayout section or by the -screen command line
option. If neither of those is present, the first Screen
section found in the config file is considered the active
one.</p>

<p>Screen sections have the following format:</p>

<p>Section &quot;Screen&quot; Identifier &quot;name&quot;
Device &quot;devid&quot; Monitor &quot;monid&quot; entries
... SubSection &quot;Display&quot; entries ... EndSubSection
... EndSection</p>

<p>The Identifier entry is mandatory. All others are
optional.</p>

<p>The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this
screen. The Screen section provides information specific to
the whole screen, including screen-specific Options. In
multi-head configurations, there will be multiple active
Screen sections, one for each head. The entries available
for this section are:</p>

<p>Device &quot;device-id&quot; This entry specifies the
Device section to be used for this screen. When multiple
graphics cards are present, this is what ties a specific
card to a screen. The device-id must match the Identifier of
a Device section in the config file.</p>

<p>Monitor &quot;monitor-id&quot; specifies which monitor
description is to be used for this screen. If a Monitor name
is not specified, a default configu- ration is used.
Currently the default configuration may not function as
expected on all platforms.</p>

<p>VideoAdaptor &quot;xv-id&quot; specifies an optional Xv
video adaptor description to be used with this screen.</p>

<p>DefaultDepth depth specifies which color depth the
server should use by default. The -depth command line option
can be used to override this. If neither is specified, the
default depth is driver-specific, but in most cases is
8.</p>

<p>DefaultFbBpp bpp specifies which framebuffer layout to
use by default. The -fbbpp command line option can be used
to override this. In most cases the driver will chose the
best default value for this. The only case where there is
even a choice in this value is for depth 24, where some
hardware supports both a packed 24 bit framebuffer layout
and a sparse 32 bit framebuffer layout.</p>

<p>Options Various Option flags may be specified in the
Screen section. Some are driver-specific and are described
in the driver docu- mentation. Others are
driver-independent, and will eventually be described
here.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Accel&quot; Enables 2D hardware
acceleration. This option is on by default, but it may be
necessary to turn it off if there are bugs in the driver.
There are many options to disable specific accelerated
operations, listed below. Note that disabling an operation
will have no effect if the operation is not accelerated
(whether due to lack of support in the hardware or in the
driver).</p>

<p>Option &quot;InitPrimary&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Use
the Int10 module to initialize the primary graphics card.
Normally, only secondary cards are soft-booted using the
Int10 module, as the primary card has already been
initialized by the BIOS at boot time. Default: false.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoInt10&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disables
the Int10 module, a module that uses the int10 call to the
BIOS of the graphics card to initialize it. Default:
false.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoMTRR&quot; Disables MTRR (Memory Type
Range Register) support, a feature of modern processors
which can improve video performance by a fac- tor of up to
2.5. Some hardware has buggy MTRR support, and some video
drivers have been known to exhibit problems when MTRRs are
used.</p>

<p>Each Screen section may optionally contain one or more
Display subsec- tions. Those subsections provide depth/fbbpp
specific configuration information, and the one chosen
depends on the depth and/or fbbpp that is being used for the
screen. The Display subsection format is described in the
section below.</p>

<p>DISPLAY SUBSECTION Each Screen section may have multiple
Display subsections. The active Display subsection is the
first that matches the depth and/or fbbpp values being used,
or failing that, the first that has neither a depth or fbbpp
value specified. The Display subsections are optional. When
there isn t one that matches the depth and/or fbbpp values
being used, all the parameters that can be specified here
fall back to their defaults.</p>

<p>Display subsections have the following format:</p>

<p>SubSection &quot;Display&quot; Depth depth entries ...
EndSubSection</p>

<p>Depth depth This entry specifies what colour depth the
Display subsection is to be used for. This entry is usually
specified, but it may be omitted to create a match-all
Display subsection or when wishing to match only against the
FbBpp parameter. The range of depth values that are allowed
depends on the driver. Most drivers support 8, 15, 16 and
24. Some also support 1 and/or 4, and some may support other
values (like 30). Note: depth means the number of bits in a
pixel that are actually used to determine the pixel colour.
32 is not a valid depth value. Most hardware that uses 32
bits per pixel only uses 24 of them to hold the colour
information, which means that the colour depth is 24, not
32.</p>

<p>FbBpp bpp This entry specifies the framebuffer format
this Display subsec- tion is to be used for. This entry is
only needed when provid- ing depth 24 configurations that
allow a choice between a 24 bpp packed framebuffer format
and a 32bpp sparse framebuffer format. In most cases this
entry should not be used.</p>

<p>Weight red-weight green-weight blue-weight This optional
entry specifies the relative RGB weighting to be used for a
screen is being used at depth 16 for drivers that allow
multiple formats. This may also be specified from the
command line with the -weight option (see Xorg(1)).</p>

<p>Virtual xdim ydim This optional entry specifies the
virtual screen resolution to be used. xdim must be a
multiple of either 8 or 16 for most drivers, and a multiple
of 32 when running in monochrome mode. The given value will
be rounded down if this is not the case. Video modes which
are too large for the specified virtual size will be
rejected. If this entry is not present, the virtual screen
resolution will be set to accommodate all the valid video
modes given in the Modes entry. Some drivers/hardware
combina- tions do not support virtual screens. Refer to the
appropriate driver-specific documentation for details.</p>

<p>ViewPort x0 y0 This optional entry sets the upper left
corner of the initial display. This is only relevant when
the virtual screen resolu- tion is different from the
resolution of the initial video mode. If this entry is not
given, then the initial display will be centered in the
virtual display area.</p>

<p>Modes &quot;mode-name&quot; ... This optional entry
specifies the list of video modes to use. Each mode-name
specified must be in double quotes. They must correspond to
those specified or referenced in the appropriate Monitor
section (including implicitly referenced built-in VESA
standard modes). The server will delete modes from this list
which dont satisfy various requirements. The first valid
mode in this list will be the default display mode for
startup. The list of valid modes is converted internally
into a circular list. It is possible to switch to the next
mode with Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus and to the previous mode with
Ctrl+Alt+Key- pad-Minus. When this entry is omitted, the
valid modes refer- enced by the appropriate Monitor section
will be used. If the Monitor section contains no modes, then
the selection will be taken from the built-in VESA standard
modes.</p>

<p>Visual &quot;visual-name&quot; This optional entry sets
the default root visual type. This may also be specified
from the command line (see the Xserver(1) man page). The
visual types available for depth 8 are (default is
PseudoColor):</p>

<p>StaticGray GrayScale StaticColor PseudoColor TrueColor
DirectColor</p>

<p>The visual type available for the depths 15, 16 and 24
are (default is TrueColor):</p>

<p>TrueColor DirectColor</p>

<p>Not all drivers support DirectColor at these depths.</p>

<p>The visual types available for the depth 4 are (default
is Stat- icColor):</p>

<p>StaticGray GrayScale StaticColor PseudoColor</p>

<p>The visual type available for the depth 1 (monochrome)
is Stat- icGray.</p>

<p>Black red green blue This optional entry allows the
black colour to be specified. This is only supported at
depth 1. The default is black.</p>

<p>White red green blue This optional entry allows the
white colour to be specified. This is only supported at
depth 1. The default is white.</p>

<p>Options Option flags may be specified in the Display
subsections. These may include driver-specific options and
driver-independent options. The former are described in the
driver-specific docu- mentation. Some of the latter are
described above in the sec- tion about the Screen section,
and they may also be included here.</p>

<p>SERVERLAYOUT SECTION The config file may have multiple
ServerLayout sections. A server layout represents the
binding of one or more screens (Screen sections) and one or
more input devices (InputDevice sections) to form a complete
configuration. In multi-head configurations, it also
specifies the relative layout of the heads. A ServerLayout
section is considered active if it is referenced by the
-layout command line option or by an Option
&quot;DefaultServerLayout&quot; entry in the ServerFlags
section (the former takes precedence over the latter). If
those options are not used, the first ServerLayout section
found in the config file is con- sidered the active one. If
no ServerLayout sections are present, the single active
screen and two active (core) input devices are selected as
described in the relevant sections above.</p>

<p>ServerLayout sections have the following format:</p>

<p>Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot; Identifier
&quot;name&quot; Screen &quot;screen-id&quot; ...
InputDevice &quot;idev-id&quot; ... options ...
EndSection</p>

<p>Each ServerLayout section must have an Identifier entry
and at least one Screen entry.</p>

<p>The Identifier entry specifies the unique name for this
server layout. The ServerLayout section provides information
specific to the whole session, including session-specific
Options. The ServerFlags options (described above) may be
specified here, and ones given here override those given in
the ServerFlags section.</p>

<p>The entries that may be used in this section are
described here.</p>

<p>Screen screen-num &quot;screen-id&quot;
position-information One of these entries must be given for
each screen being used in a session. The screen-id field is
mandatory, and specifies the Screen section being
referenced. The screen-num field is optional, and may be
used to specify the screen number in multi-head
configurations. When this field is omitted, the screens will
be numbered in the order that they are listed in. The
numbering starts from 0, and must be consecutive. The posi-
tion-information field describes the way multiple screens
are positioned. There are a number of different ways that
this information can be provided:</p>

<p>x y</p>

<p>Absolute x y These both specify that the upper left
corner s coordinates are (x,y). The Absolute keyword is
optional. Some older versions of XFree86 (4.2 and earlier)
don t recognise the Absolute keyword, so its safest to just
specify the coordi- nates without it.</p>

<p>RightOf &quot;screen-id&quot;</p>

<p>LeftOf &quot;screen-id&quot;</p>

<p>Above &quot;screen-id&quot;</p>

<p>Below &quot;screen-id&quot;</p>

<p>Relative &quot;screen-id&quot; x y These give the screen
s location relative to another screen. The first four
position the screen immediately to the right, left, above or
below the other screen. When positioning to the right or
left, the top edges are aligned. When posi- tioning above or
below, the left edges are aligned. The Relative form
specifies the offset of the screens origin (upper left
corner) relative to the origin of another screen.</p>

<p>InputDevice &quot;idev-id&quot; &quot;option&quot; ...
One of these entries should be given for each input device
being used in a session. Normally at least two are required,
one each for the core pointer and keyboard devices. If
either of those is missing, suitable InputDevice entries are
searched for using the method described above in the
INPUTDEVICE section. The idev-id field is mandatory, and
specifies the name of the Input- Device section being
referenced. Multiple option fields may be specified, each in
double quotes. The options permitted here are any that may
also be given in the InputDevice sections. Normally only
session-specific input device options would be used here.
The most commonly used options are:</p>

<p>&quot;CorePointer&quot; &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
&quot;SendCoreEvents&quot;</p>

<p>and the first two should normally be used to indicate
the core pointer and core keyboard devices respectively.</p>

<p>Options In addition to the following, any option
permitted in the ServerFlags section may also be specified
here. When the same option appears in both places, the value
given here overrides the one given in the ServerFlags
section.</p>

<p>Option &quot;IsolateDevice&quot; &quot;bus-id&quot;
Restrict device resets to the specified bus-id. See the
BusID option (described in DEVICE SECTION, above) for the
format of the bus-id parameter. This option overrides
SingleCard, if specified. At present, only PCI devices can
be isolated in this manner.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SingleCard&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; As
IsolateDevice, except that the bus ID of the first device in
the layout is used.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a ServerLayout section for a dual
headed configu- ration with two mice:</p>

<p>Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot; Identifier &quot;Layout
1&quot; Screen &quot;MGA 1&quot; Screen &quot;MGA 2&quot;
RightOf &quot;MGA 1&quot; InputDevice &quot;Keyboard 1&quot;
&quot;CoreKeyboard&quot; InputDevice &quot;Mouse 1&quot;
&quot;CorePointer&quot; InputDevice &quot;Mouse 2&quot;
&quot;SendCoreEvents&quot; Option &quot;BlankTime&quot;
&quot;5&quot; EndSection</p>

<p>DRI SECTION This optional section is used to provide
some information for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure.
Details about the format of this sec- tion can be found
on-line at &lt;http://dri.freedesktop.org/&gt;.</p>

<p>VENDOR SECTION The optional Vendor section may be used
to provide vendor-specific con- figuration information.
Multiple Vendor sections may be present, and they may
contain an Identifier entry and multiple Option flags. The
data therein is not used in this release.</p>
