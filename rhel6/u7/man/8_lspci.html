<p>lspci(8) The PCI Utilities lspci(8)</p>

<p>NAME lspci - list all PCI devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lspci [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lspci is a utility for displaying
information about PCI buses in the system and devices
connected to them.</p>

<p>By default, it shows a brief list of devices. Use the
options described below to request either a more verbose
output or output intended for parsing by other programs.</p>

<p>If you are going to report bugs in PCI device drivers or
in lspci itself, please include output of &quot;lspci
-vvx&quot; or even better &quot;lspci -vvxxx&quot; (however,
see below for possible caveats).</p>

<p>Some parts of the output, especially in the highly
verbose modes, are probably intelligible only to experienced
PCI hackers. For exact defi- nitions of the fields, please
consult either the PCI specifications or the header.h and
/usr/include/linux/pci.h include files.</p>

<p>Access to some parts of the PCI configuration space is
restricted to root on many operating systems, so the
features of lspci available to normal users are limited.
However, lspci tries its best to display as much as
available and mark all other information with &lt;access
denied&gt; text.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Basic display modes -m Dump PCI device data in a
backward-compatible machine readable form. See below for
details.</p>

<p>-mm Dump PCI device data in a machine readable form for
easy parsing by scripts. See below for details.</p>

<p>-t Show a tree-like diagram containing all buses,
bridges, devices and connections between them.</p>

<p>Display options -v Be verbose and display detailed
information about all devices.</p>

<p>-vv Be very verbose and display more details. This level
includes everything deemed useful.</p>

<p>-vvv Be even more verbose and display everything we are
able to parse, even if it doesnt look interesting at all
(e.g., unde- fined memory regions).</p>

<p>-k Show kernel drivers handling each device and also
kernel modules capable of handling it. Turned on by default
when -v is given in the normal mode of output. (Currently
works only on Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)</p>

<p>-x Show hexadecimal dump of the standard part of the
configuration space (the first 64 bytes or 128 bytes for
CardBus bridges).</p>

<p>-xxx Show hexadecimal dump of the whole PCI
configuration space. It is available only to root as several
PCI devices crash when you try to read some parts of the
config space (this behavior proba- bly doesn t violate the
PCI standard, but its at least very stupid). However, such
devices are rare, so you neednt worry much.</p>

<p>-xxxx Show hexadecimal dump of the extended (4096-byte)
PCI configura- tion space available on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI
Express buses.</p>

<p>-b Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses
as seen by the cards on the PCI bus instead of as seen by
the kernel.</p>

<p>-D Always show PCI domain numbers. By default, lspci
suppresses them on machines which have only domain 0.</p>

<p>Options to control resolving Is to names -n Show PCI
vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking them
up in the PCI ID list.</p>

<p>-nn Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and
names.</p>

<p>-q Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a
device is not found in the local pci.ids file. If the DNS
query succeeds, the result is cached in ~/.pciids-cache and
it is recognized in sub- sequent runs even if -q is not
given any more. Please use this switch inside automated
scripts only with caution to avoid over- loading the
database servers.</p>

<p>-qq Same as -q, but the local cache is reset.</p>

<p>-Q Query the central database even for entries which are
recognized locally. Use this if you suspect that the
displayed entry is wrong.</p>

<p>Options for selection of devices -s
[[[[&lt;domain&gt;]:]&lt;bus&gt;]:][&lt;slot&gt;][.[&lt;func&gt;]]
Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your
machine has several host bridges, they can either share a
common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI
domain of its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus
(0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7). Each
component of the device address can be omitted or set to
&quot;*&quot;, both meaning &quot;any value&quot;. All
numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., &quot;0:&quot; means all
devices on bus 0, &quot;0&quot; means all functions of
device 0 on any bus, &quot;0.3&quot; selects third function
of device 0 on all buses and &quot;.4&quot; shows only the
fourth function of each device.</p>

<p>-d [&lt;vendor&gt;]:[&lt;device&gt;] Show only devices
with specified vendor and device ID. Both IDs are given in
hexadecimal and may be omitted or given as &quot;*&quot;,
both meaning &quot;any value&quot;.</p>

<p>Other options -i &lt;file&gt; Use &lt;file&gt; as the
PCI ID list instead of /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids.</p>

<p>-p &lt;file&gt; Use &lt;file&gt; as the map of PCI IDs
handled by kernel modules. By default, lspci uses
/lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap. Applies only to
Linux systems with recent enough module tools.</p>

<p>-M Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough
scan of all PCI devices, including those behind
misconfigured bridges, etc. This option gives meaningful
results only with a direct hardware access mode, which
usually requires root privileges. Please note that the bus
mapper only scans PCI domain 0.</p>

<p>--version Shows lspci version. This option should be
used stand-alone.</p>

<p>PCI access options The PCI utilities use the PCI library
to talk to PCI devices (see pcilib(7) for details). You can
use the following options to influence its behavior:</p>

<p>-A &lt;method&gt; The library supports a variety of
methods to access the PCI hardware. By default, it uses the
first access method avail- able, but you can use this option
to override this decision. See -A help for a list of
available methods and their descriptions.</p>

<p>-O &lt;param&gt;=&lt;value&gt; The behavior of the
library is controlled by several named parameters. This
option allows to set the value of any of the parameters. Use
-O help for a list of known parameters and their default
values.</p>

<p>-H1 Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration
mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)</p>

<p>-H2 Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration
mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)</p>

<p>-F &lt;file&gt; Instead of accessing real hardware, read
the list of devices and values of their configuration
registers from the given file pro- duced by an earlier run
of lspci -x. This is very useful for analysis of
user-supplied bug reports, because you can display the
hardware configuration in any way you want without disturb-
ing the user with requests for more dumps.</p>

<p>-G Increase debug level of the library.</p>

<p>MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT If you intend to process the
output of lspci automatically, please use one of the
machine-readable output formats (-m, -vm, -vmm) described in
this section. All other formats are likely to change between
versions of lspci.</p>

<p>All numbers are always printed in hexadecimal. If you
want to process numeric IDs instead of names, please add the
-n switch.</p>

<p>Simple format (-m) In the simple format, each device is
described on a single line, which is formatted as parameters
suitable for passing to a shell script, i.e., values
separated by whitespaces, quoted and escaped if necessary.
Some of the arguments are positional: slot, class, vendor
name, device name, subsystem vendor name and subsystem name
(the last two are empty if the device has no subsystem); the
remaining arguments are option- like:</p>

<p>-rrev Revision number.</p>

<p>-pprogif Programming interface.</p>

<p>The relative order of positional arguments and options
is undefined. New options can be added in future versions,
but they will always have a single argument not separated
from the option by any spaces, so they can be easily ignored
if not recognized.</p>

<p>Verbose format (-vmm) The verbose output is a sequence
of records separated by blank lines. Each record describes a
single device by a sequence of lines, each line containing a
single tag: value pair. The tag and the value are sepa-
rated by a single tab character. Neither the records nor the
lines within a record are in any particular order. Tags are
case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The following tags are defined:</p>

<p>Slot The name of the slot where the device resides
([domain:]bus:device.function). This tag is always the first
in a record.</p>

<p>Class Name of the class.</p>

<p>Vendor Name of the vendor.</p>

<p>Device Name of the device.</p>

<p>SVendor Name of the subsystem vendor (optional).</p>

<p>SDevice Name of the subsystem (optional).</p>

<p>PhySlot The physical slot where the device resides
(optional, Linux only).</p>

<p>Rev Revision number (optional).</p>

<p>ProgIf Programming interface (optional).</p>

<p>Driver Kernel driver currently handling the device
(optional, Linux only).</p>

<p>Module Kernel module reporting that it is capable of
handling the device (optional, Linux only).</p>

<p>New tags can be added in future versions, so you should
silently ignore any tags you dont recognize.</p>

<p>Backward-compatible verbose format (-vm) In this mode,
lspci tries to be perfectly compatible with its old ver-
sions. Its almost the same as the regular verbose format,
but the Device tag is used for both the slot and the device
name, so it occurs twice in a single record. Please avoid
using this format in any new code.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids A list of all known PCI
IDs (vendors, devices, classes and sub- classes). Maintained
at http://pciids.sourceforge.net/, use the update-pciids
utility to download the most recent version.</p>

<p>/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids.gz If lspci is compiled with
support for compression, this file is tried before
pci.ids.</p>

<p>~/.pciids-cache All ID s found in the DNS query mode are
cached in this file.</p>

<p>BUGS Sometimes, lspci is not able to decode the
configuration registers com- pletely. This usually happens
when not enough documentation was avail- able to the
authors. In such cases, it at least prints the &lt;?&gt;
mark to signal that there is potentially something more to
say. If you know the details, patches will be of course
welcome.</p>

<p>Access to the extended configuration space is currently
supported only by the linux_sysfs back-end.</p>
