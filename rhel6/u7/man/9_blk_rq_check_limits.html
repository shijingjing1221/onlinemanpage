<p>NAME blk_rq_check_limits - Helper function to check a
request for the queue limit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int blk_rq_check_limits(struct request_queue *
q, struct request * rq);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q the queue</p>

<p>rq the request being checked</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rq may have been made based on weaker
limitations of upper-level queues in request stacking
drivers, and it may violate the limitation of q. Since the
block layer and the underlying device driver trust rq after
it is inserted to q, it should be checked against q before
the insertion using this generic function.</p>

<p>This function should also be useful for request stacking
drivers in some cases below, so export this fuction. Request
stacking drivers like request-based dm may change the queue
limits while requests are in the queue (e.g. dm&acute;s
table swapping). Such request stacking drivers should check
those requests agaist the new queue limits again when they
dispatch those requests, although such checkings are also
done against the old queue limits when submitting
requests.</p>
