<p>NAME df - report file system disk space usage</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS df [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the GNU version
of df. df displays the amount of disk space available on the
file system containing each file name argument. If no file
name is given, the space available on all currently mounted
file systems is shown. Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by
default, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.</p>

<p>If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk
device node contain- ing a mounted file system, df shows the
space available on that file system rather than on the file
system containing the device node (which is always the root
file system). This version of df cannot show the space
available on unmounted file systems, because on most kinds
of systems doing so requires very nonportable intimate
knowledge of file system structures.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Show information about the file system on which
each FILE resides, or all file systems by default.</p>

<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options too.</p>

<p>-a, --all include dummy file systems</p>

<p>-B, --block-size=SIZE use SIZE-byte blocks</p>

<p>--direct show statistics for a file instead of mount
point</p>

<p>--total produce a grand total</p>

<p>-h, --human-readable print sizes in human readable
format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)</p>

<p>-H, --si likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024</p>

<p>-i, --inodes list inode information instead of block
usage</p>

<p>-k like --block-size=1K</p>

<p>-l, --local limit listing to local file systems</p>

<p>--no-sync do not invoke sync before getting usage info
(default)</p>

<p>-P, --portability use the POSIX output format</p>

<p>--sync invoke sync before getting usage info</p>

<p>-t, --type=TYPE limit listing to file systems of type
TYPE</p>

<p>-T, --print-type print file system type</p>

<p>-x, --exclude-type=TYPE limit listing to file systems
not of type TYPE</p>

<p>-v (ignored)</p>

<p>--help display this help and exit</p>

<p>--version output version information and exit</p>

<p>Display values are in units of the first available SIZE
from --block-size, and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE and
BLOCKSIZE environ- ment variables. Otherwise, units default
to 1024 bytes (or 512 if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).</p>

<p>SIZE may be (or may be an integer optionally followed
by) one of fol- lowing: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M
1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.</p>
