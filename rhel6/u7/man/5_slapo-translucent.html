<p>NAME slapo-translucent - Translucent Proxy overlay to
slapd</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Translucent Proxy overlay can be used
with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to create a
&quot;translucent proxy&quot;. Entries retrieved from a
remote LDAP server may have some or all attributes
overridden, or new attributes added, by entries in the local
database before being presented to the client.</p>

<p>A search operation is first populated with entries from
the remote LDAP server, the attributes of which are then
overridden with any attributes defined in the local
database. Local overrides may be populated with the add,
modify , and modrdn operations, the use of which is
restricted to the root user.</p>

<p>A compare operation will perform a comparison with
attributes defined in the local database record (if any)
before any comparison is made with data in the remote
database.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The Translucent Proxy overlay uses a
proxied database, typically a (set of) remote LDAP
server(s), which is configured with the options shown in
slapd-ldap(5), slapd-meta(5) or similar. These slapd.conf
options are specific to the Translucent Proxy overlay; they
must appear after the overlay directive that instantiates
the translucent overlay.</p>

<p>translucent_strict By default, attempts to delete
attributes in either the local or remote databases will be
silently ignored. The translu- cent_strict directive causes
these modifications to fail with a Constraint Violation.</p>

<p>translucent_no_glue This configuration option disables
the automatic creation of &quot;glue&quot; records for an
add or modrdn operation, such that all parents of an entry
added to the local database must be created by hand. Glue
records are always created for a modify operation.</p>

<p>translucent_local &lt;attr[,attr...]&gt; Specify a list
of attributes that should be searched for in the local
database when used in a search filter. By default, search
filters are only handled by the remote database. With this
directive, search filters will be split into a local and
remote portion, and local attributes will be searched
locally.</p>

<p>translucent_remote &lt;attr[,attr...]&gt; Specify a list
of attributes that should be searched for in the remote
database when used in a search filter. This directive
complements the translucent_local directive. Attributes may
be specified as both local and remote if desired.</p>

<p>If neither translucent_local nor translucent_remote are
specified, the default behavior is to search the remote
database with the complete search filter. If only
translucent_local is specified, searches will only be run on
the local database. Likewise, if only translucent_remote is
specified, searches will only be run on the remote database.
In any case, both the local and remote entries corresponding
to a search result will be merged before being returned to
the client.</p>

<p>translucent_bind_local Enable looking for locally stored
credentials for simple bind when binding to the remote
database fails. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>translucent_pwmod_local Enable RFC 3062 Password
Modification extended operation on locally stored
credentials. The operation only applies to entries that
exist in the remote database. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL Access control is delegated to either the
remote DSA(s) or to the local database backend for auth and
write operations. It is delegated to the remote DSA(s) and
to the frontend for read operations. Local access rules
involving data returned by the remote DSA(s) should be
designed with care. In fact, entries are returned by the
remote DSA(s) only based on the remote fraction of the data,
based on the identity the operation is performed as. As a
consequence, local rules might only be allowed to see a
portion of the remote data.</p>

<p>CAVEATS The Translucent Proxy overlay will disable
schema checking in the local database, so that an entry
consisting of overlay attributes need not adhere to the
complete schema.</p>

<p>Because the translucent overlay does not perform any DN
rewrites, the local and remote database instances must have
the same suffix. Other configurations will probably fail
with No Such Object and other errors.</p>
