<p>NAME fipvlan - Fibre Channel over Ethernet VLAN
Discovery</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fipvlan [-c|--create] [-s|--start]
interfaces</p>

<p>fipvlan -a|--auto [-c|--create] [-d|--debug]
[-s|--start] [-l|--link-retry count]</p>

<p>fipvlan -h|--help</p>

<p>fipvlan -v|--version</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fipvlan command performs Fibre Channel
over Ethernet (FCoE) Initialization Protocol (FIP) VLAN
Discovery over Ethernet interfaces. fipvlan can be used as a
diagnostic tool to determine which VLANs have FCoE services
available on a network, prior to configuring VLAN interfaces
and the Open-FCoE initiator. fipvlan can also be used to
create VLAN interfaces as they are discovered, and to start
the Open-FCoE initiator. The --create and --start options
are primarily intended to be used as part of an Open-FCoE
boot solution. FCoE instances started in this way cannot be
destroyed or reset by fcoeadm.</p>

<p>fipvlan takes a list of network interface names to run
the VLAN discovery protocol over, or the --auto option to
use all available Ethernet interfaces.</p>

<p>fipvlan will enable any interface which is found
disabled. If no response is received on that interface it
will be shutdown again when fipvlan terminates.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --auto Use all Ethernet interfaces currently
available</p>

<p>-c, --create Create network interfaces for discovered
FCoE VLANs. If a VLAN device already exists for a discovered
VLAN, a new VLAN device will not be created.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Enable debugging output</p>

<p>-s, --start Start the Open-FCoE initiator on discovered
FCoE VLANs</p>

<p>-f, --suffix suffix Append the specified string suffix
to VLAN interface names.</p>

<p>-l, --link-retry count Retry check for link up to count
times. The link state is checked every 500 ms. The default
number of retries is 20.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a help message with basic usage
instructions</p>

<p>-v, --version Display the fipvlan version string</p>

<p>VLAN NAMING CONVENTIONS If a new VLAN device is created,
it will have the name dev.vlan; where dev is the name of the
Ethernet parent device and vlan is the discovered VLAN ID
number. An optional suffix may be appended to this with the
the -f command line option.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Display all discoverable VLANs with FCoE
services</p>

<p>fipvlan --auto</p>

<p>Discover FCoE VLANs on interface eth2, create VLAN
devices and start the Open-FCoE initiator</p>

<p>fipvlan --create --start eth2</p>

<p>In this example if FCoE services were available on VLAN
101 of network interface eth2, then a VLAN interface
eth2.101 would be created and used as the parent device for
the initiator.</p>

maintained through the Open-FCoE project. Resources for both
developers and users can be found at the Open-FCoE website
