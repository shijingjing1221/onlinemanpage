<p>initctl(8) initctl(8)</p>

<p>NAME initctl - init daemon control tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS initctl [OPTION]... COMMAND [OPTION]...
ARG...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION initctl allows a system administrator to
communicate and interact with the Upstart init(8)
daemon.</p>

<p>When run as initctl, the first non-option argument is
the COMMAND. Global options may be specified before or after
the command.</p>

<p>You may also create symbolic or hard links to initctl
named after com- mands. When invoked through these links the
tool will behave only as that command, with global and
command-specific options intermixed. The default
installation supplies such links for the start, stop,
restart, reload and status commands.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --system Communication with the init(8) daemon
is normally performed over a private socket connection. This
has the advantage of speed and robustness, when issuing
commands to start or stop services or even reboot the system
you do not want to be affected by changes to the D-Bus
system bus daemon.</p>

<p>The disadvantage to using the private socket however is
secu- rity, init(8) only permits the root user to
communicate over this socket which means that read-only
commands such as status and list cannot be made by other
users.</p>

<p>The --system option instructs initctl to communicate via
the D- Bus system bus rather than over the private
socket.</p>

<p>This is only possible if the system bus daemon is
running and if init(8) is connected to it. The advantage is
that the default security configuration allows non-root
users to use read-only commands.</p>

<p>--dest Specifies the well-known name of the init(8)
daemon when using --system.</p>

<p>There is normally no need to use this option since the
init(8) daemon uses the default com.ubuntu.Upstart name.
However it may be useful for debugging.</p>

<p>--no-wait Applies to the start, stop, restart and emit
commands.</p>

<p>Normally initctl will wait for the command to finish
before returning.</p>

<p>For the start, stop and restart commands, finishing
means that the named job is running (or has finished for
tasks) or has been fully stopped.</p>

<p>For the emit command, finishing means that all of the
jobs affected by the event are running (or have finished for
tasks) or have been fully stopped.</p>

<p>This option instead causes these commands to only wait
for the goal change or event to be queued.</p>

<p>--quiet Reduces output of all commands to errors
only.</p>

<p>COMMANDS start JOB [KEY=VALUE]...</p>

<p>Requests that a new instance of the named JOB be
started, out- putting the status of the job to standard
output when the com- mand completes.</p>

<p>See status for a description of the output format.</p>

<p>The optional KEY=VALUE arguments specify environment
variables to be passed to the starting job, and placed in
its environment. They also serve to specify which instance
of multi-instance jobs should be started.</p>

<p>Most jobs only permit a single instance; those that use
the instance stanza in their configuration define a string
expanded from environment variables to name the instance. As
many unique instances may be started as unique names may be
generated by the stanza. Thus the environment variables also
serve to select which instance of JOB is to be acted
upon.</p>

<p>If the job is already running, start will return an
error.</p>

<p>stop JOB [KEY=VALUE]...</p>

<p>Requests that an instance of the named JOB be stopped,
out- putting the status of the job to standard output when
the com- mand completes.</p>

<p>See status for a description of the output format and
start for a discussion on instances.</p>

<p>restart JOB [KEY=VALUE]...</p>

<p>Requests that an instance of the named JOB be restarted,
out- putting the status of the job to standard output when
the com- mand completes.</p>

<p>See status for a description of the output format and
start for a discussion on instances.</p>

<p>Note that this command can only be used when there is an
instance of JOB, if there is none then it returns an error
instead of starting a new one.</p>

<p>reload JOB [KEY=VALUE]...</p>

<p>Sends the SIGHUP signal to running process of the named
JOB instance.</p>

<p>See start for a discussion on instances.</p>

<p>status JOB [KEY=VALUE]...</p>

<p>Requests the status an instance of the named JOB,
outputting to standard output.</p>

<p>See start for a discusson on instances.</p>

<p>For a single-instance job a line like the following is
output:</p>

<p>job start/running, process 1234</p>

<p>The job name is given first followed by the current goal
and state of the selected instance. The goal is either start
or stop, the status may be one of waiting, starting,
pre-start, spawned, post-start, running, pre-stop, stopping,
killed or post-stop.</p>

<p>If the job has an active process, the process id will
follow on the same line. If the state is pre-start or
post-stop this will be the process id of the equivalent
process, otherwise it will be the process id of the main
process.</p>

<p>job start/pre-start, process 902</p>

<p>The post-start and pre-stop states may have multiple
processes attached, the extra processes will follow on
consecutive lines indented by a tab:</p>

<p>job start/post-start, process 1234 post-start process
1357</p>

<p>If there is no main process, they may follow on the same
line but will be prefixed to indicate that it is not the
main process id being given:</p>

<p>job start/post-start, (post-start) process 1357</p>

<p>Jobs that permit multiple instances have names for each
instance, the output is otherwise identical to the above
except that the instance name follows the job name in
parentheses:</p>

<p>job (tty1) start/post-start, process 1234 post-start
process 1357</p>

<p>list Requests a list of the known jobs and instances,
outputs the status of each to standard output.</p>

<p>See status for a description of the output format and
start for a discussion on instances.</p>

<p>No particular order is used for the output, and there is
no dif- ference in the output (other than the instance name
appearing in parentheses) between single-instance and
multiple-instance jobs.</p>

<p>emit EVENT [KEY=VALUE]...</p>

<p>Requests that the named EVENT be emitted, potentially
causing jobs to be started and stopped depending on their
use of the start on and stop on stanzas in their
configuration.</p>

<p>The optional KEY=VALUE arguments specify environment
variables to be included with the event and thus exported
into the envi- ronment of any jobs started and stopped by
the event.</p>

<p>The environment may also serve to specify which instance
of multi-instance jobs should be started or stopped. See
start for a discussion on instances.</p>

<p>There is no limitation on the event names that may be
emitted with this command, you are free to invent new events
and use them in your job configurations.</p>

<p>The most well known event used by the default Upstart
configura- tion is the runlevel(7) event. This is normally
emitted by the telinit(8) and shutdown(8) tools.</p>

<p>reload-configuration</p>

<p>Requests that the init(8) daemon reloads its
configuration.</p>

<p>This command is generally not necessary since init(8)
watches its configuration directories with inotify(7) and
automatically reloads in cases of changes.</p>

<p>No jobs will be started by this command.</p>

<p>version</p>

<p>Requests and outputs the version of the running init
daemon.</p>

<p>log-priority [PRIORITY]</p>

<p>When called with a PRIORITY argument, it requests that
the init(8) daemon log all messages with that priority or
greater. This may be used to both increase and decrease the
volume of logged messages.</p>

<p>PRIORITY may be one of debug, info, message, warn, error
or fatal.</p>

<p>When called without argument, it requests the current
minimum message priority that the init(8) daemon will log
and ouputs to standard output.</p>

<p>usage JOB [KEY=VALUE]...</p>

<p>Show usage information an instance of the named JOB
defined with usage stanza.</p>

<p>For job with usage stanza a line like the following is
output, see init(5) :</p>

<p>Usage: tty DEV=ttyX - where X is console id</p>
