<p>IPSEC_RSASIGKEY(8) [FIXME: manual]
IPSEC_RSASIGKEY(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_rsasigkey - generate RSA signature key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec rsasigkey [--verbose] [--random filename]
[--rounds nr] [--configdir nssdbdir] [--password
nsspassword] [--hostname hostname] [--noopt] nbits</p>

<p>ipsec rsasigkey [--verbose] [--configdir nssdbdir]
[--password nsspassword] [--hostname hostname] [--noopt]
[--oldkey filename]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rsasigkey generates an RSA public/private
key pair, suitable for digital signatures, of (exactly)
nbits bits (that is, two primes each of exactly nbits/2
bits, and related numbers) and emits it on standard output
as ASCII (mostly hex) data. nbits must be a multiple of
16.</p>

<p>The public exponent is forced to the value 3, which has
important speed advantages for signature checking. Beware
that the resulting keys have known weaknesses as encryption
keys and should not be used for that purpose.</p>

<p>The --verbose option makesrsasigkey give a running
commentary on standard error. By default, it works in
silence until it is ready to generate output.</p>

<p>The --random option specifies a source for random bits.
The default is /dev/random (see random(4)). Normally,
rsasigkey reads exactly nbits random bits from the source;
in extremely-rare circumstances it may need more. Under
Linux with hardware random support, the special device
/dev/hw_random is created. However, the driver does not
guarantee FIPS compliant random, and some hardware is so
broken that it return extremely non-random data. Therefor
/dev/hw_random should never be used with the --random
option. Instead, one should run the rngd(8) daemon to funnel
randomness from /dev/hw_random into /dev/random.</p>

<p>The --rounds option specifies the number of rounds to be
done by the pz_probab_prime_p probabilistic primality
checker. The default, 30, is fairly rigorous and should not
normally have to be overridden.</p>

<p>The --Configdir option specifies the nss configuration
directory to use. This is the directory where the NSS
certificate, key and security modules databases reside.</p>

<p>The --password option specifies the nss cryptographic
module authentication password if the NSS module has been
configured to require it. A password is required by hardware
tokens and also by the internal softotken module when
configured to run in FIPS mode.</p>

<p>The --hostname option specifies what host name to use in
the first line of the output (see below); the default is
what gethostname(2) returns.</p>

<p>The --hostname option suppresses an optimization of the
private key (to be precise, setting of the decryption
exponent to lcm(p-1,q-1) rather than (p-1)*(q-1)) which
speeds up operations on it slightly but can cause it to
flunk a validity check in old RSA implementations (notably,
obsolete versions of ipsec_pluto(8)</p>

<p>--oldkey option specifies that rather than generate a
new key, rsasigkey should read an old key from the file (the
name &acute;-&acute; means &acute;standard input&acute;) and
use that to generate its output. Input lines which do not
look like rsasigkey output are silently ignored. This
permits updating old keys to the current format.</p>

<p>The output format looks like this (with long numbers
trimmed down for clarity):</p>

<p># RSA 2048 bits xy.example.com Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
# for signatures only, UNSAFE FOR ENCRYPTION
#pubkey=0sAQOF8tZ2NZt...Y1P+buFuFn/ Modulus:
0xcc2a86fcf440...cf1011abb82d1 PublicExponent: 0x03 #
everything after this point is secret PrivateExponent:
0x881c59fdf8...ab05c8c77d23 Prime1:
0xf49fd1f779...46504c7bf3 Prime2: 0xd5a9108453...321d43cb2b
Exponent1: 0xa31536a4fb...536d98adda7f7 Exponent2:
0x8e70b5ad8d...9142168d7dcc7 Coefficient:
0xafb761d001...0c13e98d98</p>

<p>The first (comment) line, indicating the nature and date
of the key, and giving a host name, is used by
ipsec_showhostkey(8) when generating some forms of key
output.</p>

<p>The commented-out pubkey= line contains the public key,
the public exponent and the modulus combined in
approximately RFC 2537 format (the one deviation is that the
combined value is given with a 0s prefix, rather than in
unadorned base-64), suitable for use in the ipsec.conf
file.</p>

<p>The Modulus, PublicExponent and PrivateExponent lines
give the basic signing and verification data.</p>

<p>The Prime1 and Prime2 lines give the primes themselves
(aka p and q), largest first. The Exponent1 and Exponent2
lines give the private exponent mod p-1 and q-1
respectively. The Coefficient line gives the Chinese
Remainder Theorem coefficient, which is the inverse of q,
mod p. These additional numbers (which must all be kept as
secret as the private exponent) are precomputed aids to
rapid signature generation.</p>

<p>No attempt is made to break long lines.</p>

<p>The US patent on the RSA algorithm expired 20 Sept
2000.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES ipsec rsasigkey --verbose 2192 &gt;mykey.txt
generates a 2192-bit signature key and puts it in the file
mykey.txt, with running commentary on standard error. The
file contents can be inserted verbatim into a suitable entry
in the ipsec.secrets file (see ipsec_secrets(5)), and the
public key can then be extracted and edited into the
ipsec.conf (see ipsec_showhostkey(8)).</p>

<p>ipsec rsasigkey --verbose --oldkey oldie &gt;latest.txt
takes the old signature key from file oldie and puts a
version in the current format into the file latest, with
running commentary on standard error.</p>

<p>HISTORY Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.</p>

<p>BUGS There is an internal limit on nbits, currently
20000.</p>

<p>rsasigkey&acute;s run time is difficult to predict,
since /dev/random output can be arbitrarily delayed if the
system&acute;s entropy pool is low on randomness, and the
time taken by the search for primes is also somewhat
unpredictable. A reasonably typical time for a 1024-bit key
on a quiet 100MHz Pentium MMX with plenty of randomness
available is 20 seconds, almost all of it in the prime
searches. Generating a 2192-bit key on the same system
usually takes several minutes. A 4096-bit key took an hour
and a half of CPU time.</p>

<p>The --oldkey option does not check its input format as
rigorously as it might. Corrupted rsasigkey output may
confuse it.</p>
