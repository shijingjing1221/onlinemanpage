<p>GETPEERNAME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
GETPEERNAME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getpeername - get the name of the peer socket</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>int getpeername(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict
address, socklen_t *restrict address_len);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getpeername() function shall retrieve
the peer address of the spec- ified socket, store this
address in the sockaddr structure pointed to by the address
argument, and store the length of this address in the object
pointed to by the address_len argument.</p>

<p>If the actual length of the address is greater than the
length of the supplied sockaddr structure, the stored
address shall be truncated.</p>

<p>If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients,
and the peer is not bound, then the value stored in the
object pointed to by address is unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getpeername() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The socket argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL The socket has been shut down.</p>

<p>ENOTCONN The socket is not connected or otherwise has
not had the peer pre-specified.</p>

<p>ENOTSOCK The socket argument does not refer to a
socket.</p>

<p>EOPNOTSUPP The operation is not supported for the socket
protocol.</p>

<p>The getpeername() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOBUFS Insufficient resources were available in the
system to complete the call.</p>
