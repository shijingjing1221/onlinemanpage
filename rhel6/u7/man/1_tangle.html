<p>TANGLE(1) TANGLE(1)</p>

<p>NAME tangle - translate WEB to Pascal</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tangle [ options ] webfile[.web] [
changefile[.ch] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documen- tation for this version of
TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX
implementation.</p>

<p>The tangle program converts a Web source document into a
Pascal program that may be compiled in the usual way with
the on-line Pascal compiler (e.g., pc(1)). The output file
is packed into lines of 72 characters or less, with the only
concession to readability being the termination of lines at
semicolons when this can be done conveniently.</p>

<p>The Web language allows you to prepare a single document
containing all the information that is needed both to
produce a compilable Pascal pro- gram and to produce a
well-formatted document describing the program in as much
detail as the writer may desire. The user of Web must be
familiar with both TeX and Pascal. Web also provides a
relatively sim- ple, although adequate, macro facility that
permits a Pascal program to be written in small
easily-understood modules.</p>

<p>The command line should have either one or two names on
it. The first is taken as the Web file (and .web is added if
there is no extension). If there is another name, it is a
change file (and .ch is added if there is no extension). The
change file overrides parts of the Web file, as described in
the Web system documentation.</p>

<p>The output files are a Pascal file and a string pool
file, whose names are formed by adding .p and .pool
respectively to the root of the Web file name.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This version of tangle understands the following
options. Note that some of these options may render the
output unsuitable for processing by a Pascal compiler.</p>

<p>--help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>--length number Compare only the first number characters
of identifiers when checking for collisions. The default is
32, the original tangle used 7.</p>

<p>--loose When checking for collisions between
identifiers, honor the set- tings of the --lowercase,
--mixedcase, --uppercase, and --under- line options. This is
the default.</p>

<p>--lowercase Convert all identifiers to lowercase.</p>

<p>--mixedcase Retain the case of identifiers. This is the
default.</p>

<p>--strict When checking for collisions between
identifiers, strip under- lines and convert all identifiers
to uppercase first.</p>

<p>--underline Retain underlines (also known as
underscores) in identifiers.</p>

<p>--uppercase Convert all identifiers to uppercase. This
is the behaviour of the original tangle.</p>

<p>--version Print version information and exit.</p>

when debugging), tex(1).</p>

<p>AUTHORS Web was designed by Donald E. Knuth, based on an
earlier system called DOC (implemented by Ignacio Zabala).
The tangle and weave programs are themselves written in Web.
The system was originally ported to Unix at Stanford by
Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.</p>
