<p>NAME g3topbm - convert a Group 3 fax file into a PBM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS g3topbm [-kludge] [-reversebits] [-stretch]
[-width=pixels | paper_size={A3|A4|A5|A6|B4}] [-stop_error]
[g3file]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>g3topbm reads a Group 3 fax file in MH format as input
and produces a PBM image as output.</p>

<p>g3topbm tolerates various deviations from the standard,
so as to recover some of the image if there was a
transmission error. One thing it tolerates is lines of
varying length. The standard requires all the lines to be
the same length; g3topbm makes the output image as wide as
the longest line in the input and pads the others on the
right. It warns you when it does this.</p>

<p>You can use the stop_error option to make g3topbm insist
on valid input.</p>

<p>There is no Netpbm program that understands the other
command fax for- mats, MR and MMR.</p>

<p>There are subformats of TIFF that use the Group 3 fax
encodings inside. See tifftopnm.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -kludge Tells g3topbm to ignore the first few
lines of the file; some- times fax files have some junk at
the beginning.</p>

<p>-reversebits Tells g3topbm to interpret bits
least-significant first, instead of the default
most-significant first. Apparently some fax modems do it one
way and others do it the other way. If you get a whole bunch
of bad code word messages, try using this option.</p>

<p>-stretch This option tells g3topbm to stretch the image
vertically by duplicating each row. This is for the
low-quality transmission mode.</p>

<p>-width=pixels This option tells g3topbm that the image
is supposed to be pix- els pixels wide. If any line in it is
not that size, g3topbm issues a warning or fails, depending
on whether you specify -stop_error.</p>

<p>You cannot specify both -width and -paper_size.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.33 (March 2006).</p>

<p>-paper_size={A3,A4,A5,A6,B4} This option tells g3topbm
for what size paper this image is sup- posed to be
formatted. g3topbm uses the width of the paper the same way
as with the -width option. g3topbm does not use the height
of the paper for anything.</p>

<p>You cannot specify both -width and -paper_size.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.33 (March 2006).</p>

<p>-stop_error This option tells g3topbm to fail when it
finds a problem in the input. Fail means it terminates with
a nonzero status code with the contents of the output file
undefined.</p>

<p>If you dont specify this option, g3topbm does its best
to work around input errors and salvage as much of the image
as possible in the output image. It first tries to
resynchronize to a later line by searching for the next End
Of Line marker, skipping any lines or partial lines in
between. It saves the beginning of the line in which it
encountered the problem. If the input file ends prematurely,
g3topbm produces output containing the lines up to where it
encountered the problem.</p>

<p>g3topbm issues warning messages when it continues in
spite of input errors.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.24 (August 2004).
Before that, g3topbm always failed when it encountered
premature EOF and never failed when it encountered other
problems.</p>
