<p>NAME pppdump - convert PPP record file to readable
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pppdump [ -h | -p [ -d ]] [ -r ] [ -m mru ] [
file ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pppdump utility converts the files
written using the record option of pppd into a
human-readable format. If one or more filenames are
specified, pppdump will read each in turn; otherwise it will
read its standard input. In each case the result is written
to standard output.</p>

<p>The options are as follows:</p>

<p>-h Prints the bytes sent and received in hexadecimal. If
neither this option nor the -p option is specified, the
bytes are printed as the characters themselves, with
non-printing and non- ASCII characters printed as escape
sequences.</p>

<p>-p Collects the bytes sent and received into PPP
packets, inter- preting the async HDLC framing and escape
characters and check- ing the FCS (frame check sequence) of
each packet. The packets are printed as hex values and as
characters (non-printable char- acters are printed as
.).</p>

<p>-d With the -p option, this option causes pppdump to
decompress packets which have been compressed with the
BSD-Compress or Deflate methods.</p>

<p>-r Reverses the direction indicators, so that sent is
printed for bytes or packets received, and rcvd is printed
for bytes or packets sent.</p>

<p>-m mru Use mru as the MRU (maximum receive unit) for
both directions of the link when checking for over-length
PPP packets (with the -p option).</p>
