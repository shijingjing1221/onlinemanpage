<p>NAME acpid - Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
event daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS acpid [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION acpid is designed to notify user-space
programs of ACPI events. acpid should be started during the
system boot, and will run as a background process, by
default. It will open an events file (/proc/acpi/event by
default) and attempt to read whole lines. When a line is
received (an event), acpid will examine a list of rules, and
execute the rules that match the event. acpid will ignore
all incoming ACPI events if a lock file exists
(/var/lock/acpid by default).</p>

<p>Rules are defined by simple configuration files. acpid
will look in a configuration directory (/etc/acpi/events by
default), and parse all regular files that do not begin with
a period (.) or end with a tilde (~). Each file must define
two things: an event and an action. Any blank lines, or
lines where the first character is a hash (#) are ignored.
Extraneous lines are flagged as warnings, but are not fatal.
Each line has three tokens: the key, a literal equal sign,
and the value. The key can be up to 63 characters, and is
case-insensitive (but whitespace matters). The value can be
up to 511 characters, and is case and whitespace
sensitive.</p>

<p>The event value is a regular expression (see
regcomp(3)), against which events are matched.</p>

<p>The action value is a commandline, which will be invoked
via /bin/sh whenever an event matching the rule in question
occurs. The command- line may include shell-special
characters, and they will be preserved. The only special
characters in an action value are &quot;%&quot; escaped. The
string &quot;%e&quot; will be replaced by the literal text
of the event for which the action was invoked. This string
may contain spaces, so the comman- dline must take care to
quote the &quot;%e&quot; if it wants a single token. The
string &quot;%%&quot; will be replaced by a literal
&quot;%&quot;. All other &quot;%&quot; escapes are reserved,
and will cause a rule to not load.</p>

<p>This feature allows multiple rules to be defined for the
same event (though no ordering is guaranteed), as well as
one rule to be defined for multiple events. To force acpid
to reload the rule configuration, send it a SIGHUP.</p>

<p>In addition to rule files, acpid also accepts
connections on a UNIX domain socket (/var/run/acpid.socket
by default). Any application may connect to this socket.
Once connected, acpid will send the text of all ACPI events
to the client. The client has the responsibility of
filtering for messages about which it cares. acpid will not
close the client socket except in the case of a SIGHUP or
acpid exiting.</p>

<p>acpid will log all of its activities, as well as the
stdout and stderr of any actions, to syslog.</p>

<p>All the default files and directories can be changed
with commandline options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --confdir directory This option changes the
directory in which acpid looks for rule configuration files.
Default is /etc/acpi/events.</p>

<p>-C, --clientmax number This option changes the maximum
number of non-root socket connections which can be made to
the acpid socket. Default is 256.</p>

<p>-d, --debug This option increases the acpid debug level
by one. If the debug level is non-zero, acpid will run in
the foreground, and will log to stderr, in addition to the
regular syslog.</p>

<p>-e, --eventfile filename This option changes the event
file from which acpid reads events. Default is
/proc/acpi/event.</p>

<p>-f, --foreground This option keeps acpid in the
foreground by not forking at startup.</p>

<p>-l, --logevents This option tells acpid to log
information about all events and actions.</p>

<p>-L, --lockfile filename This option changes the lock
file used to stop event pro- cessing. Default is
/var/lock/acpid.</p>

<p>-g, --socketgroup groupname This option changes the
group ownership of the UNIX domain socket to which acpid
publishes events.</p>

<p>-m, --socketmode mode This option changes the
permissions of the UNIX domain socket to which acpid
publishes events. Default is 0666.</p>

<p>-s, --socketfile filename This option changes the name
of the UNIX domain socket which acpid opens. Default is
/var/run/acpid.socket.</p>

<p>-S, --nosocket filename This option tells acpid not to
open a UNIX domain socket. This overrides the -s option, and
negates all other socket options.</p>

<p>-p, --pidfile filename This option tells acpid to use
the specified file as its pidfile. If the file exists, it
will be removed and over- written. Default is
/var/run/acpid.pid.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show help and exit.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example - placed in /etc/acpi/events/power
- will shut down your system if you press the power
button.</p>

<p>event=button/power.* action=/usr/local/sbin/power.sh
&quot;%e&quot;</p>

<p>The script power.sh gets called and will see the
complete event string as parameter $1.</p>

<p>DEPENDENCIES acpid should work on any linux kernel
released since 2003.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/acpi/event /etc/acpi/ /var/run/acpid.socket
/var/run/acpid.pid /var/lock/acpid</p>
