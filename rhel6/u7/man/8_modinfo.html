<p>MODINFO(8) MODINFO(8)</p>

<p>NAME modinfo - program to show information about a Linux
Kernel module</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS modinfo [ -0 ] [ -F field ] [ -k kernel ] [
modulename|filename... ]</p>

<p>modinfo -V</p>

<p>modinfo -h</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION modinfo extracts information from the Linux
Kernel modules given on the command line. If the module name
is not a filename, then the /lib/mod- ules/version directory
is searched, as done by modprobe(8).</p>

<p>modinfo by default lists each attribute of the module in
form fieldname : value, for easy reading. The filename is
listed the same way (although its not really an
attribute).</p>

<p>This version of modinfo can understand modules of any
Linux Kernel architecture.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V --version Print the modinfo version.</p>

<p>-F --field Only print this field value, one per line.
This is most useful for scripts. Field names are
case-insenitive. Common fields (which may not be in every
module) include author, description, license, parm, depends,
and alias. There are often multiple parm, alias and depends
fields. The special field filename lists the filename of the
module.</p>

<p>-k kernel Provide information about a kernel other than
the running one. This is particularly useful for
distributions needing to extract information from a newly
installed (but not yet running) set of kernel modules. For
example, you wish to find which firmware files are needed by
various modules in a new kernel for which you must make an
initrd image prior to booting.</p>

<p>-0 --null Use the ASCII zero character to separate field
values, instead of a new line. This is useful for scripts,
since a new line can theoretically appear inside a
field.</p>

<p>-a -d -l -p -n These are shortcuts for author,
description, license. parm and filename respectively, to
ease the transition from the old modu- tils modinfo.</p>
