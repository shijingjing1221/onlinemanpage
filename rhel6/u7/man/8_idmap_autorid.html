<p>NAME idmap_autorid - Samba&rsquo;s idmap_autorid Backend
for Winbind</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The idmap_autorid backend provides a way to
use an algorithmic mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs
that is more deterministic than idmap_tdb and easier to
configure than idmap_rid.</p>

<p>The module works similar to idmap_rid, but it
automatically configures the range to be used for each
domain, so there is no need to specify a specific range for
each domain in the forest, the only configuration that is
needed is the range of uid/gids that shall be used for
user/group mappings and an optional size of the ranges to be
used.</p>

<p>The mappings of which domain is mapped to which range is
stored in autorid.tdb, thus you should backup this database
regularly.</p>

<p>Due to the algorithm being used, it is the module that
is most easy to use as it only requires a minimal
configuration.</p>

<p>IDMAP OPTIONS rangesize = numberofidsperdomain Defines
the available number of uids/gids per domain. The minimum
needed value is 2000. SIDs with RIDs larger than this value
cannot be mapped, are ignored and the corresponding map is
discarded. Choose this value carefully, as this should not
be changed after the first ranges for domains have been
defined, otherwise mappings between domains will get
intermixed leading to unpredictable results. Please note
that RIDs in Windows Domains usually start with 500 for
builtin users and 1000 for regular users. As the parameter
cannot be changed later, please plan accordingly for your
expected number of users in a domain with safety
margins.</p>

<p>One range will be used for local users and groups. Thus
the number of local users and groups that can be created is
limited by this option as well. If you plan to create a
large amount of local users or groups, you will need set
this parameter accordingly.</p>

<p>The default value is 100000.</p>

<p>THE MAPPING FORMULAS The Unix ID for a RID is calculated
this way:</p>

<p>ID = IDMAP UID LOW VALUE + DOMAINRANGENUMBER * RANGESIZE
+ RID</p>

<p>Correspondingly, the formula for calculating the RID for
a given Unix ID is this:</p>

<p>RID = ID - IDMAP UID LOW VALUE - DOMAINRANGENUMBER *
RANGESIZE</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This example shows you the minimal
configuration that will work for the principial domain and
19 trusted domains.</p>

<p>[global] security = ads workgroup = CUSTOMER realm =
CUSTOMER.COM</p>

<p>idmap config * : backend = autorid idmap config * :
range = 1000000-1999999</p>

<p>This example shows how to configure idmap_autorid as
default for all domains with a potentially large amount of
users plus a specific configuration for a trusted domain
that uses the SFU mapping scheme. Please note that idmap
ranges and sfu ranges are not allowed to overlap.</p>

<p>[global] security = ads workgroup = CUSTOMER realm =
CUSTOMER.COM</p>

<p>idmap config * : backend = autorid idmap config * :
range = 1000000-19999999 idmap config * : rangesize =
1000000</p>

<p>idmap config TRUSTED : backend = ad idmap config TRUSTED
: range = 50000 - 99999 idmap config TRUSTED : schema_mode =
sfu</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
