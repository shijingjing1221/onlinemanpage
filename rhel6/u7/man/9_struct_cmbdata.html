<p>STRUCT CMBDATA(9) The ccw bus STRUCT CMBDATA(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_cmbdata - channel measurement block data for
user space</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct cmbdata { __u64 size; __u64
elapsed_time; __u64 ssch_rsch_count; __u64 sample_count;
__u64 device_connect_time; __u64 function_pending_time;
__u64 device_disconnect_time; __u64
control_unit_queuing_time; __u64 device_active_only_time;
__u64 device_busy_time; __u64 initial_command_response_time;
};</p>

<p>MEMBERS size size of the stored data</p>

<p>elapsed_time time since last sampling</p>

<p>ssch_rsch_count number of ssch and rsch</p>

<p>sample_count number of samples</p>

<p>device_connect_time time of device connect</p>

<p>function_pending_time time of function pending</p>

<p>device_disconnect_time time of device disconnect</p>

<p>control_unit_queuing_time time of control unit
queuing</p>

<p>device_active_only_time time of device active only</p>

<p>device_busy_time time of device busy (ext. format)</p>

<p>initial_command_response_time initial command response
time (ext. format)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION All values are stored as 64 bit for
simplicity, especially in 32 bit emulation mode. All time
values are normalized to nanoseconds. Currently, two formats
are known, which differ by the size of this structure, i.e.
the last two members are only set when the extended channel
measurement facility (first shipped in z990 machines) is
activated. Potentially, more fields could be added, which
would result in a new ioctl number.</p>
