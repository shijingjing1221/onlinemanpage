<p>NAME vmmouse - VMware Mouse input driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;InputDevice&quot; Identifier
&quot;idevname&quot; Driver &quot;vmmouse&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vmmouse is an XFree86 input driver for mice.
The driver supports most available mouse types and
interfaces. USB mice are only supported on some OSs, and the
level of support for PS/2 mice depends on the OS.</p>

<p>The vmmouse driver functions as a pointer input device,
and may be used as the X server s core pointer. Multiple
mice are supported by multi- ple instances of this
driver.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details and for options that can be
used with all input drivers. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The driver will automatically detect if the vmmouse
device is present and if it is not, it will load the regular
mouse driver and attempt to fall back to it. There are no
vmmouse specific options, but if you set mouse(4) options,
they will be passed on.</p>

<p>See the mouse(4) man page for details on these
options.</p>
