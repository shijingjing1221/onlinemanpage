<p>NAME gnutls_x509_crt_set_issuer_dn_by_oid - Set the
Certificate request issuers distinguished name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/x509.h&gt;</p>

<p>int
gnutls_x509_crt_set_issuer_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t crt,
const char * oid, unsigned int raw_flag, const void * name,
unsigned int sizeof_name);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_x509_crt_t crt a certificate of type
gnutls_x509_crt_t</p>

<p>const char * oid holds an Object Identifier in a null
terminated string</p>

<p>unsigned int raw_flag must be 0, or 1 if the data are
DER encoded</p>

<p>const void * name a pointer to the name</p>

<p>unsigned int sizeof_name holds the size of name</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will set the part of the name
of the Certificate issuer, specified by the given OID. The
input string should be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded.</p>

<p>Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in
gnutls/x509.h With this function you can only set the known
OIDs. You can test for known OIDs using
gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known(). For OIDs that are not known (by
gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data, and call
this func- tion with raw_flag set.</p>

<p>Normally you do not need to call this function, since
the signing oper- ation will copy the signer s name as the
issuer of the certificate.</p>

<p>RETURNS On success, GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS is returned,
otherwise a negative error value.</p>
