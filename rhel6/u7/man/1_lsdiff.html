<p>NAME lsdiff - show which files are modified by a
patch</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lsdiff [[-n] | [--line-number]] [[-p n] |
[--strip-match=n]] [--strip=n] [--addprefix=PREFIX] [[-s] |
[--status]] [[-E] | [--empty-files-as-removed]] [[-i
PATTERN] | [--include=PATTERN]] [[-x PATTERN] |
[--exclude=PATTERN]] [[-z] | [--decompress]] [[-# RANGE] |
[--hunks=RANGE]] [--lines=RANGE] [--files=RANGE] [[-H] |
[--with-filename]] [[-h] | [--no-filename]] [[-v] |
[--verbose]...] [file...]</p>

<p>lsdiff {[--help] | [--version] | [--filter ...] |
[--grep ...]}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION List the files modified by a patch.</p>

<p>You can use both unified and context format diffs with
this program.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n, --line-number Display the line number that
each patch begins at. If verbose output is requested (using
-nv), each hunk of each patch is listed as well.</p>

<p>For each file that is modified, a line is generated
containing the line number of the beginning of the patch,
followed by a Tab character, followed by the name of the
file that is modified. If -v is given once, following each
of these lines will be one line for each hunk, consisting of
a Tab character, the line number that the hunk begins at,
another Tab character, the string Hunk #, and the hunk
number (starting at 1).</p>

<p>If the -v is given twice in conjunction with -n (i.e.
-nvv), the format is slightly different: hunk-level
descriptive text is shown after each hunk number, and the
--number-files option is enabled.</p>

<p>--number-files File numbers are listed, beginning at 1,
before each filename.</p>

<p>-# RANGE, --hunks=RANGE Only list hunks within the
specified RANGE. Hunks are numbered from 1, and the range is
a comma-separated list of numbers or first-last spans;
either the first or the last in the span may be omitted to
indicate no limit in that direction.</p>

<p>--lines=RANGE Only list hunks that contain lines from
the original file that lie within the specified RANGE. Lines
are numbered from 1, and the range is a comma-separated list
of numbers or first-last spans; either the first or the last
in the span may be omitted to indicate no limit in that
direction.</p>

<p>--files=RANGE Only list files indicated by the specified
RANGE. Files are numbered from 1 in the order they appear in
the patch input, and the range is a comma-separated list of
numbers or first-last spans; either the first or the last in
the span may be omitted to indicate no limit in that
direction.</p>

<p>-p n, --strip-match=n When matching, ignore the first n
components of the pathname.</p>

<p>--strip=n Remove the first n components of the pathname
before displaying it.</p>

<p>--addprefix=PREFIX Prefix the pathname with PREFIX
before displaying it.</p>

<p>-s, --status Show file additions, modifications and
removals. A file addition is indicated by a +, a removal by
a -, and a modification by a !.</p>

<p>-E, --empty-files-as-removed Treat empty files as absent
for the purpose of displaying file additions, modifications
and removals.</p>

<p>-i PATTERN, --include=PATTERN Include only files
matching PATTERN.</p>

<p>-x PATTERN, --exclude=PATTERN Exclude files matching
PATTERN.</p>

<p>-z, --decompress Decompress files with extensions .gz
and .bz2.</p>

<p>-H, --with-filename Print the name of the patch file
containing each patch.</p>

<p>-h, --no-filename Suppress the name of the patch file
containing each patch.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Verbose output.</p>

<p>--help Display a short usage message.</p>

<p>--version Display the version number of lsdiff.</p>

<p>--filter Behave like filterdiff(1) instead.</p>

<p>--grep Behave like grepdiff(1) instead.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO filterdiff(1), grepdiff(1)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To sort the order of touched files in a patch,
you can use:</p>

<p>lsdiff patch | sort -u | xargs -rn1 filterdiff patch
-i</p>

<p>To show only added files in a patch:</p>

<p>lsdiff -s patch | grep &acute;^+&acute; | cut -c2- |
xargs -rn1 filterdiff patch -i</p>

<p>To show the headers of all file hunks:</p>

<p>lsdiff -n patch | (while read n file do sed -ne
&quot;$n,$(($n+1))p&quot; patch done)</p>
