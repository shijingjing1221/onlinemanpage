<p>SEM_TRYWAIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SEM_TRYWAIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sem_trywait, sem_wait - lock a semaphore
(REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sem_trywait(sem_t *sem); int sem_wait(sem_t
*sem);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sem_trywait() function shall lock the
semaphore referenced by sem only if the semaphore is
currently not locked; that is, if the semaphore value is
currently positive. Otherwise, it shall not lock the
semaphore.</p>

<p>The sem_wait() function shall lock the semaphore
referenced by sem by performing a semaphore lock operation
on that semaphore. If the semaphore value is currently zero,
then the calling thread shall not return from the call to
sem_wait() until it either locks the semaphore or the call
is interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p>Upon successful return, the state of the semaphore shall
be locked and shall remain locked until the sem_post()
function is executed and returns successfully.</p>

<p>The sem_wait() function is interruptible by the delivery
of a signal.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The sem_trywait() and sem_wait() functions
shall return zero if the calling process successfully
performed the semaphore lock operation on the semaphore
designated by sem. If the call was unsuccessful, the state
of the semaphore shall be unchanged, and the function shall
return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sem_trywait() and sem_wait() functions shall
fail if:</p>

<p>EAGAIN The semaphore was already locked, so it cannot be
immediately locked by the sem_trywait() operation (
sem_trywait() only).</p>

<p>EINVAL The sem argument does not refer to a valid
semaphore.</p>

<p>The sem_trywait() and sem_wait() functions may fail
if:</p>

<p>EDEADLK A deadlock condition was detected.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal interrupted this function.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications using these functions may
be subject to priority inver- sion, as discussed in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285,
Priority Inversion.</p>

<p>The sem_trywait() and sem_wait() functions are part of
the Semaphores option and need not be provided on all
implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>

1003.1-2001, &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>
