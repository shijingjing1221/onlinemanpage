<p>MYSQL_CLIENT_TEST(1) MySQL Database System
MYSQL_CLIENT_TEST(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysql_client_test - test client API
mysql_client_test_embedded - test client API for embedded
server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysql_client_test [options] [test_name] ...</p>

<p>mysql_client_test_embedded [options] [test_name] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mysql_client_test program is used for
testing aspects of the MySQL client API that cannot be
tested using mysqltest and its test language.
mysql_client_test_embedded is similar but used for testing
the embedded server. Both programs are run as part of the
test suite.</p>

<p>The source code for the programs can be found in in
tests/mysql_client_test.c in a source distribution. The
program serves as a good source of examples illustrating how
to use various features of the client API.</p>

<p>mysql_client_test is used in a test by the same name in
the main tests suite of mysql-test-run.pl but may also be
run directly. Unlike the other programs listed here, it does
not read an external description of what tests to run.
Instead, all tests are coded into the program, which is
written to cover all aspects of the C language API.</p>

<p>mysql_client_test supports the following options:</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --basedir=dir_name, -b dir_name</p>

<p>The base directory for the tests.</p>

<p>&middot; --count=count, -t count</p>

<p>The number of times to execute the tests.</p>

<p>&middot; --database=db_name, -D db_name</p>

<p>The database to use.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug[=debug_options], -#[debug_options]</p>

<p>Write a debugging log if MySQL is built with debugging
support. The default debug_options value is
&rsquo;d:t:o,/tmp/mysql_client_test.trace&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; --getopt-ll-test=option, -g option</p>

<p>Option to use for testing bugs in the getopt
library.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name, -h host_name</p>

<p>Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.</p>

<p>&middot; --password[=password], -p[password]</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. If
you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space
between the option and the password. If you omit the
password value following the --password or -p option on the
command line, you are prompted for one.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num, -P port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.</p>

<p>&middot; --server-arg=arg, -A arg</p>

<p>Argument to send to the embedded server.</p>

<p>&middot; --show-tests, -T</p>

<p>Show all test names.</p>

<p>&middot; --silent, -s</p>

<p>Be more silent.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path, -S path</p>

<p>The socket file to use when connecting to localhost
(which is the default host).</p>

<p>&middot; --testcase, -c</p>

<p>The option is used when called from mysql-test-run.pl,
so that mysql_client_test may optionally behave in a
different way than if called manually, for example by
skipping some tests. Currently, there is no difference in
behavior but the option is included to make this
possible.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the
server.</p>

<p>&middot; -v dir_name, --vardir=dir_name</p>

<p>The data directory for tests. The default is
mysql-test/var.</p>
