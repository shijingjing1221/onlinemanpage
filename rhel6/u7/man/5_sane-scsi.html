<p>NAME sane-scsi - SCSI adapter tips for scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page contains various
operating-system specific tips and tricks on how to get
scanners with a SCSI interface working.</p>

<p>GENERAL INFO For scanners with a SCSI interface, it may
be necessary to edit the appropriate backend configuration
file before using SANE for the first time. For most systems,
the configuration file should list the name of the generic
SCSI device that the scanner is connected to (e.g., under
Linux, /dev/sg4 or /dev/sge is such a generic SCSI device).
It is cus- tomary to create a symlink from /dev/scanner to
the generic SCSI device that the scanner is connected to. In
this case, the configuration file simply lists the line
/dev/scanner. For a detailed description of each backends
configuration file, please refer to the relevant backend
man- ual page (e.g., sane-epson(5) for Epson scanners,
sane-hp(5) for HP scanners, etc.).</p>

<p>For some operating systems (e.g. Linux and OS/2), there
is an alternate way of specifying scanner devices. This
alternate way allows to iden- tify scanners by the SCSI
vendor and model string and/or by the SCSI device address
(consisting of bus number, channel number, id, and logi- cal
unit number). The syntax for specifying a scanner in this
way is:</p>

<p>scsi VENDOR MODEL TYPE BUS CHANNEL ID LUN</p>

<p>where VENDOR is the SCSI vendor string, MODEL is the
SCSI model string, TYPE is type SCSI device type string, BUS
is the SCSI bus number (named &quot;host&quot; in
/proc/scsi/scsi), CHANNEL is the SCSI channel number, ID is
the SCSI id, and LUN is the logical unit number of the
scanner device. The first two fields are strings which must
be enclosed in double- quotes if they contain any
whitespace. The remaining four fields are non-negative
integer numbers. The correct values for these fields can be
found by using operating system specific tools, e.g. for
Linux by looking at the output of the command &quot;cat
/proc/scsi/scsi&quot;. To sim- plify configuration, a fields
value can be replaced with an asterisk symbol (*). An
asterisk has the effect that any value is allowed for that
particular field. This can have the effect that a single
scsi-line matches multiple devices. When this happens, each
matching device will be probed by the backend one by one and
registered if the backend thinks it is a compatible device.
For example, the line</p>

<p>scsi MUSTEK MFS-06000CX Scanner 0 00 03 00</p>

<p>would attach the Mustek SCSI scanner with the following
/proc/scsi/scsi entry:</p>

<p>Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 03 Lun: 00 Vendor: MUSTEK
Model: MFS-06000CX Rev: 4.04 Type: Scanner ANSI SCSI
revision: 0</p>

<p>Usually its sufficient to use vendor and model strings
only or even only the vendor string. The following
example</p>

<p>scsi MUSTEK * * * * * *</p>

<p>would have the effect that all SCSI devices in the
system with a vendor string of MUSTEK would be probed and
recognized by the backend.</p>

<p>If the remainder of a scsi-string consists of asterisks
only, the asterisks can be omitted. For example, the
following line is equiva- lent to the one specified
previously:</p>

<p>scsi MUSTEK</p>

<p>On some platforms (e.g., OpenStep), SANE device names
take a special form. This is explained below in the relevant
platform-specific sec- tion.</p>

<p>When using a SCSI scanner, ensure that the access
permission for the generic SCSI device is set appropriately.
We recommend to add a group &quot;scanner&quot; to
/etc/group which contains all users that should have access
to the scanner. The permission of the device should then be
set to allow group read and write access. For example, if
the scanner is at generic SCSI device /dev/sg0, then the
following two commands would set the permission
correctly:</p>

<p>$ chgrp scanner /dev/sg0 $ chmod 660 /dev/sg0</p>

<p>When your system uses the device filesystem (devfs), you
have to edit /etc/devfs/perms. There you should search the
line</p>

<p>REGISTER ^sg[^/]* PERMISSIONS root.root 0600</p>

<p>and add a new line (eg. for changing permissions of
sg4):</p>

<p>REGISTER ^sg4 PERMISSIONS root.scanner 0660</p>

<p>FREEBSD INFO Auto-configuration using the &quot;scsi
*&quot; lines in the config files only works if the user
running the frontend has read/write acces to /dev/xpt0.
Instead, you can also set a link /dev/scanner to the appro-
priate /dev/uk device.</p>

<p>Adaptec AHA1542CF Reported to work fine under FreeBSD
2.2.2R with the aha driver.</p>

<p>Adaptec 2940 Reported to work fine under FreeBSD
2.2.2.</p>

<p>Adaptec 1522 The scanner probes ok but any attempt to
access it hangs the entire system. It looks like something
is disabling interrupts and then not re-enabling them, so it
looks like a bug in the FreeBSD aic driver.</p>

<p>Adaptec 1505 Works on FreeBSD 2.2.5R and 3.0 using the
aic driver, provided that Plug-and-Play support is disabled
on the card. If there are no uk devices, just do a sh
MAKEDEV uk0 in the /dev directory. The scanner should then
be accessible as /dev/uk0 if it was probed during boot.</p>

<p>Tekram DC390 Reported to work fine under FreeBSD 2.2.2R
with the amd driver.</p>

<p>LINUX INFO First, make sure your kernel has SCSI generic
support enabled. In make xconfig , this shows up under SCSI
support-&gt;SCSI generic sup- port.</p>

<p>To keep scanning times to a minimum, it is strongly
recommended to use a large buffer size for the generic SCSI
driver. From SG driver version 2.0 on, the maximum buffer
size can be changed at program run time, and there is no
restriction in size. This driver version is part of the
Linux kernels from version 2.2.7 on. If the new SG driver is
available some backends (e.g. sane-umax, sane-mustek,
sane-sharp) automatically request larger scsi buffers. If a
backend does not automatically request a larger scsi buffer,
set the environment variable SANE_SG_BUFFERSIZE to the
desired buffer size in bytes. It is not rec- ommended to use
more than 1 MB, because for large values the probabil- ity
increases that the SG driver cannot allocate the necessary
buffer(s). For ISA cards, even 1 MB might be a too large
value. For a detailed discussion of memory issues of the SG
driver, see http://www.torque.net/sg.</p>

<p>For Linux kernels before version 2.2.7 the size of the
buffer is only 32KB. This works, but for many cheaper
scanners this causes scanning to be slower by about a factor
of four than when using a size of 127KB. Linux defines the
size of this buffer by macro SG_BIG_BUFF in header file
/usr/include/scsi/sg.h. Unless a system is seriously short
on memory, it is recommended to increase this value to the
maximum legal value of 128*1024-512=130560 bytes. After
changing this value, it is necessary to recompile both the
kernel (or the SCSI generic module) and the SCSI backends.
Keep in mind that this is only necessary with older Linux
kernels.</p>

<p>A common issue with SCSI scanners is what to do when you
booted the system while the scanner was turned off? In such
a case, the scanner wont be recognized by the kernel and
SANE wont be able to access it. Fortunately, Linux provides
a simple mechanism to probe a SCSI device on demand. Suppose
you have a scanner connected to SCSI bus 2 and the scanner
has a SCSI id of 5. When the system is up and running and
the scanner is turned on, you can issue the command:</p>

<p>echo &quot;scsi add-single-device 2 0 5 0&quot; &gt;
/proc/scsi/scsi</p>

<p>and the kernel will probe and recognize your scanner
(this needs to be done as root). Its also possible to
dynamically remove a SCSI device by using the
remove-single-device command. For details, please refer to
to the SCSI-2.4-HOWTO.</p>

<p>Scanners are known to work with the following SCSI
adapters under Linux. This list isnt complete, usually any
SCSI adapter supported by Linux should work.</p>

<p>Acard/Advance SCSI adapters Some old versions of the
kernel driver (atp870u.c) cut the inquiry information.
Therefore the scanner couldnt be detected correctly. Use a
current kernel.</p>

<p>Adaptec AHA-1505/AHA-1542/AHA-2940 Reported to work fine
with Linux since v2.0. If you encounter kernel freezes or
other unexpected behaviour get the latest Linux kernel
(2.2.17 seems to work) or reduce SCSI buffer size to 32
kB.</p>

<p>ASUS SC200 Reported to work fine with Linux v2.0.</p>

<p>BusLogic BT958 To configure the BusLogic card, you may
need to follow these instructions (contributed by Jeremy
&lt;jeremy@xxedgexx.com&gt;): During boot, when your
BusLogic adapter is being initialized, press Ctrl-B to enter
your BusLogic adapter setup. Choose the address which your
BusLogic containing your scanner is located. Choose SCSI
Device Configuration. Choose Scan SCSI Bus. Choose whatever
SCSI id that contains your scanner and then choose
View/Modify SCSI configuration. Change Negotiation to async
and change Disconnect to off. Press Esc, save, and Esc again
until you are asked to reboot.</p>

<p>NCR/Symbios 53c400/53c400a or Domex DTC3181E/L/LE
(DTCT436/436P) ISA SCSI card This card is supplied by Mustek
(and other vendors). Its supported since Linux 2.2. The SCSI
cards are supported by the module g_NCR5380. Its necessary
to tell the ker- nel the io port and type of card. Example
for a 53c400a: modprobe g_NCR5380 ncr_addr=0x280
ncr_53c400a=1. Once the kernel detects the card, it should
work all right. However, while it should work, do not expect
good performance out of this card---it has no interrupt line
and therefore while a scan is in progress, the system
becomes almost unusable. You may change the values of the
USLEEP macros in drivers/scsi/g_NCR5380.c. Some doc-
umentation is in this file and NCR5380.c.</p>

<p>NCR/Symbios 810 For some scanners it may be necessary to
disable discon- nect/reconnect. To achieve this use the
option ncr53c8xx=&quot;disc:n&quot;. Some people reported
that their scan- ner only worked with the 53c7,8xx driver,
not the ncr53c8xx. Try both if you have trouble. For Linux
kernels before 2.0.33 it may be necessary to increase the
SCSI timeout. The default timeout for the Linux kernels
before 2.0.33 is 10 seconds, which is way too low when
scanning large area. If you get messages of the form restart
(ncr dead ?) in your /var/log/mes- sages file or on the
system console, it s an indication that the timeout is too
short. In this case, find the line if
(np-&gt;latetime&gt;10) in file ncr53c8xx.c (nor- mally in
directory /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi) and change the
constant 10 to, say, 60 (one minute). Then rebuild the
kernel/module and try again.</p>

<p>Tekram DC315 The driver can be downloaded from
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc395/. For some older
scanners it may be necessary to disable all the more
advanced features by using e.g. modprobe dc395x_trm
dc395x_trm=7,5,1,32.</p>

<p>Tekram DC390 Version 1.11 of the Tekram driver seems to
work fine mostly, except that the scan does not terminate
properly (it causes a SCSI timeout after 10 minutes). The
generic AM53C974 also seems to work fine and does not suffer
from the timeout problems.</p>

<p>SOLARIS, OPENSTEP AND NEXTSTEP INFO Under Solaris,
OpenStep and NeXTStep, the generic SCSI device name refers
to a SCSI bus, not to an individual device. For example,
/dev/sg0 refers to the first SCSI bus. To tell SANE which
device to use, append the character a+target-id to the
special device name. For example, the SCSI device connected
to the first SCSI controller and with target-id 0 would be
called /dev/sg0a, and the device with target- id 1 on that
same bus would be called /dev/sg0b, and so on.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI If the library was
compiled with debug support enabled, this environment
variable controls the debug level for the generic SCSI I/O
subsystem. E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug output to
be printed by the backend. A value of 255 also prints kernel
messages from the SCSI subsystem (where available). Smaller
levels reduce verbosity.</p>

<p>SANE_SCSICMD_TIMEOUT sets the timeout value for SCSI
commands in seconds. Overriding the default value of 120
seconds should only be necessary for very slow scanners.</p>
