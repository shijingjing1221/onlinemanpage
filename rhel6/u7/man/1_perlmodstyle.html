<p>PERLMODSTYLE(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLMODSTYLE(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlmodstyle - Perl module style guide</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION This document attempts to describe the Perl
Community s &quot;best practice&quot; for writing Perl
modules. It extends the recommendations found in perlstyle ,
which should be considered required reading before reading
this document.</p>

<p>While this document is intended to be useful to all
module authors, it is particularly aimed at authors who wish
to publish their modules on CPAN.</p>

<p>The focus is on elements of style which are visible to
the users of a module, rather than those parts which are
only seen by the modules developers. However, many of the
guidelines presented in this document can be extrapolated
and applied successfully to a module s internals.</p>

<p>This document differs from perlnewmod in that it is a
style guide rather than a tutorial on creating CPAN modules.
It provides a checklist against which modules can be
compared to determine whether they conform to best practice,
without necessarily describing in detail how to achieve
this.</p>

<p>All the advice contained in this document has been
gleaned from extensive conversations with experienced CPAN
authors and users. Every piece of advice given here is the
result of previous mistakes. This information is here to
help you avoid the same mistakes and the extra work that
would inevitably be required to fix them.</p>

<p>The first section of this document provides an itemized
checklist; subsequent sections provide a more detailed
discussion of the items on the list. The final section,
&quot;Common Pitfalls&quot;, describes some of the most
popular mistakes made by CPAN authors.</p>

<p>QUICK CHECKLIST For more detail on each item in this
checklist, see below.</p>

<p>Before you start &middot; Dont re-invent the wheel</p>

<p>&middot; Patch, extend or subclass an existing module
where possible</p>

<p>&middot; Do one thing and do it well</p>

<p>&middot; Choose an appropriate name</p>

<p>The API &middot; API should be understandable by the
average programmer</p>

<p>&middot; Simple methods for simple tasks</p>

<p>&middot; Separate functionality from output</p>

<p>&middot; Consistent naming of subroutines or methods</p>

<p>&middot; Use named parameters (a hash or hashref) when
there are more than two parameters</p>

<p>Stability &middot; Ensure your module works under
&quot;use strict&quot; and &quot;-w&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Stable modules should maintain backwards
compatibility</p>

<p>Documentation &middot; Write documentation in POD</p>

<p>&middot; Document purpose, scope and target
applications</p>

<p>&middot; Document each publically accessible method or
subroutine, including params and return values</p>

<p>&middot; Give examples of use in your documentation</p>

<p>&middot; Provide a README file and perhaps also release
notes, changelog, etc</p>

<p>&middot; Provide links to further information (URL,
email)</p>

<p>Release considerations &middot; Specify pre-requisites
in Makefile.PL or Build.PL</p>

<p>&middot; Specify Perl version requirements with
&quot;use&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Include tests with your module</p>

<p>&middot; Choose a sensible and consistent version
numbering scheme (X.YY is the common Perl module numbering
scheme)</p>

<p>&middot; Increment the version number for every change,
no matter how small</p>

<p>&middot; Package the module using &quot;make
dist&quot;</p>

<p>&middot; Choose an appropriate license (GPL/Artistic is
a good default)</p>

<p>BEFORE YOU START WRITING A MODULE Try not to launch
headlong into developing your module without spending some
time thinking first. A little forethought may save you a
vast amount of effort later on.</p>

<p>Has it been done before? You may not even need to write
the module. Check whether its already been done in Perl, and
avoid re-inventing the wheel unless you have a good
reason.</p>

<p>Good places to look for pre-existing modules include
http://search.cpan.org/ and asking on modules@perl.org</p>

<p>If an existing module almost does what you want,
consider writing a patch, writing a subclass, or otherwise
extending the existing module rather than rewriting it.</p>

<p>Do one thing and do it well At the risk of stating the
obvious, modules are intended to be modular. A Perl
developer should be able to use modules to put together the
building blocks of their application. However, it s
important that the blocks are the right shape, and that the
developer shouldn t have to use a big block when all they
need is a small one.</p>

<p>Your module should have a clearly defined scope which is
no longer than a single sentence. Can your module be broken
down into a family of related modules?</p>

<p>Bad example:</p>

<p>&quot;FooBar.pm provides an implementation of the FOO
protocol and the related BAR standard.&quot;</p>

<p>Good example:</p>

<p>&quot;Foo.pm provides an implementation of the FOO
protocol. Bar.pm implements the related BAR
protocol.&quot;</p>

<p>This means that if a developer only needs a module for
the BAR standard, they should not be forced to install
libraries for FOO as well.</p>

<p>Whas in a name? Make sure you choose an appropriate name
for your module early on. This will help people find and
remember your module, and make programming with your module
more intuitive.</p>

<p>When naming your module, consider the following:</p>

<p>&middot; Be descriptive (i.e. accurately describes the
purpose of the module).</p>

<p>&middot; Be consistent with existing modules.</p>

<p>&middot; Reflect the functionality of the module, not
the implementation.</p>

<p>&middot; Avoid starting a new top-level hierarchy,
especially if a suitable hierarchy already exists under
which you could place your module.</p>

<p>You should contact modules@perl.org to ask them about
your module name before publishing your module. You should
also try to ask people who are already familiar with the
modules application domain and the CPAN naming system.
Authors of similar modules, or modules with similar names,
may be a good place to start.</p>

<p>DESIGNING AND WRITING YOUR MODULE Considerations for
module design and coding:</p>

<p>To OO or not to OO? Your module may be object oriented
(OO) or not, or it may have both kinds of interfaces
available. There are pros and cons of each technique, which
should be considered when you design your API.</p>

<p>According to Damian Conway, you should consider using
OO:</p>

<p>&middot; When the system is large or likely to become
so</p>

<p>&middot; When the data is aggregated in obvious
structures that will become objects</p>

<p>&middot; When the types of data form a natural hierarchy
that can make use of inheritance</p>

<p>&middot; When operations on data vary according to data
type (making polymorphic invocation of methods feasible)</p>

<p>&middot; When it is likely that new data types may be
later introduced into the system, and will need to be
handled by existing code</p>

<p>&middot; When interactions between data are best
represented by overloaded operators</p>

<p>&middot; When the implementation of system components is
likely to change over time (and hence should be
encapsulated)</p>

<p>&middot; When the system design is itself
object-oriented</p>

<p>&middot; When large amounts of client code will use the
software (and should be insulated from changes in its
implementation)</p>

<p>&middot; When many separate operations will need to be
applied to the same set of data</p>

<p>Think carefully about whether OO is appropriate for your
module. Gratuitous object orientation results in complex
APIs which are difficult for the average module user to
understand or use.</p>

<p>Designing your API Your interfaces should be
understandable by an average Perl programmer. The following
guidelines may help you judge whether your API is
sufficiently straightforward:</p>

<p>Write simple routines to do simple things. Its better to
have numerous simple routines than a few monolithic ones. If
your routine changes its behaviour significantly based on
its arguments, its a sign that you should have two (or more)
separate routines.</p>

<p>Separate functionality from output. Return your results
in the most generic form possible and allow the user to
choose how to use them. The most generic form possible is
usually a Perl data structure which can then be used to
generate a text report, HTML, XML, a database query, or
whatever else your users require.</p>

<p>If your routine iterates through some kind of list (such
as a list of files, or records in a database) you may
consider providing a callback so that users can manipulate
each element of the list in turn. File::Find provides an
example of this with its &quot;find(wanted, $dir)&quot;
syntax.</p>

<p>Provide sensible shortcuts and defaults. Dont require
every module user to jump through the same hoops to achieve
a simple result. You can always include optional parameters
or routines for more complex or non-standard behaviour. If
most of your users have to type a few almost identical lines
of code when they start using your module, it s a sign that
you should have made that behaviour a default. Another good
indicator that you should use defaults is if most of your
users call your routines with the same arguments.</p>

<p>Naming conventions Your naming should be consistent. For
instance, its better to have:</p>

<p>display_day(); display_week(); display_year();</p>

<p>than</p>

<p>display_day(); week_display(); show_year();</p>

<p>This applies equally to method names, parameter names,
and anything else which is visible to the user (and most
things that arent!)</p>

<p>Parameter passing Use named parameters. Its easier to
use a hash like this:</p>

<p>$obj-&gt;do_something( name =&gt; &quot;wibble&quot;,
type =&gt; &quot;text&quot;, size =&gt; 1024, );</p>

<p>... than to have a long list of unnamed parameters like
this:</p>

<p>$obj-&gt;do_something(&quot;wibble&quot;,
&quot;text&quot;, 1024);</p>

<p>While the list of arguments might work fine for one, two
or even three arguments, any more arguments become hard for
the module user to remember, and hard for the module author
to manage. If you want to add a new parameter you will have
to add it to the end of the list for backward compatibility,
and this will probably make your list order unintuitive.
Also, if many elements may be undefined you may see the
following unattractive method calls:</p>

<p>$obj-&gt;do_something(undef, undef, undef, undef, undef,
undef, 1024);</p>

<p>Provide sensible defaults for parameters which have
them. Dont make your users specify parameters which will
almost always be the same.</p>

<p>The issue of whether to pass the arguments in a hash or
a hashref is largely a matter of personal style.</p>

<p>The use of hash keys starting with a hyphen
(&quot;-name&quot;) or entirely in upper case
(&quot;NAME&quot;) is a relic of older versions of Perl in
which ordinary lower case strings were not handled correctly
by the &quot;=&gt;&quot; operator. While some modules retain
uppercase or hyphenated argument keys for historical reasons
or as a matter of personal style, most new modules should
use simple lower case keys. Whatever you choose, be
consistent!</p>

<p>Strictness and warnings Your module should run
successfully under the strict pragma and should run without
generating any warnings. Your module should also handle
taint-checking where appropriate, though this can cause
difficulties in many cases.</p>

<p>Backwards compatibility Modules which are
&quot;stable&quot; should not break backwards compatibility
without at least a long transition phase and a major change
in version number.</p>

<p>Error handling and messages When your module encounters
an error it should do one or more of:</p>

<p>&middot; Return an undefined value.</p>

<p>&middot; set $Module::errstr or similar
(&quot;errstr&quot; is a common name used by DBI and other
popular modules; if you choose something else, be sure to
document it clearly).</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;warn()&quot; or &quot;carp()&quot; a
message to STDERR.</p>

<p>&middot; &quot;croak()&quot; only when your module
absolutely cannot figure out what to do.
(&quot;croak()&quot; is a better version of
&quot;die()&quot; for use within modules, which reports its
errors from the perspective of the caller. See Carp for
details of &quot;croak()&quot;, &quot;carp()&quot; and other
useful routines.)</p>

<p>&middot; As an alternative to the above, you may prefer
to throw exceptions using the Error module.</p>

<p>Configurable error handling can be very useful to your
users. Consider offering a choice of levels for warning and
debug messages, an option to send messages to a separate
file, a way to specify an error-handling routine, or other
such features. Be sure to default all these options to the
commonest use.</p>

<p>DOCUMENTING YOUR MODULE POD Your module should include
documentation aimed at Perl developers. You should use Perls
&quot;plain old documentation&quot; (POD) for your general
technical documentation, though you may wish to write
additional documentation (white papers, tutorials, etc) in
some other format. You need to cover the following
subjects:</p>

<p>&middot; A synopsis of the common uses of the module</p>

<p>&middot; The purpose, scope and target applications of
your module</p>

<p>&middot; Use of each publically accessible method or
subroutine, including parameters and return values</p>

<p>&middot; Examples of use</p>

<p>&middot; Sources of further information</p>

<p>&middot; A contact email address for the
author/maintainer</p>

<p>The level of detail in Perl module documentation
generally goes from less detailed to more detailed. Your
SYNOPSIS section should contain a minimal example of use
(perhaps as little as one line of code; skip the unusual use
cases or anything not needed by most users); the DESCRIPTION
should describe your module in broad terms, generally in
just a few paragraphs; more detail of the modules routines
or methods, lengthy code examples, or other in-depth
material should be given in subsequent sections.</p>

<p>Ideally, someone whos slightly familiar with your module
should be able to refresh their memory without hitting
&quot;page down&quot;. As your reader continues through the
document, they should receive a progressively greater amount
of knowledge.</p>

<p>The recommended order of sections in Perl module
documentation is:</p>

<p>&middot; NAME</p>

<p>&middot; SYNOPSIS</p>

<p>&middot; DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>&middot; One or more sections or subsections giving
greater detail of available methods and routines and any
other relevant information.</p>

<p>&middot; BUGS/CAVEATS/etc</p>

<p>&middot; AUTHOR</p>

<p>&middot; SEE ALSO</p>

<p>&middot; COPYRIGHT and LICENSE</p>

<p>Keep your documentation near the code it documents
(&quot;inline&quot; documentation). Include POD for a given
method right above that methods subroutine. This makes it
easier to keep the documentation up to date, and avoids
having to document each piece of code twice (once in POD and
once in comments).</p>

<p>README, INSTALL, release notes, changelogs Your module
should also include a README file describing the module and
giving pointers to further information (website, author
email).</p>

<p>An INSTALL file should be included, and should contain
simple installation instructions. When using
ExtUtils::MakeMaker this will usually be:</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL make make test make install</p>

<p>When using Module::Build, this will usually be:</p>

<p>perl Build.PL perl Build perl Build test perl Build
install</p>

<p>Release notes or changelogs should be produced for each
release of your software describing user-visible changes to
your module, in terms relevant to the user.</p>

<p>RELEASE CONSIDERATIONS Version numbering Version numbers
should indicate at least major and minor releases, and
possibly sub-minor releases. A major release is one in which
most of the functionality has changed, or in which major new
functionality is added. A minor release is one in which a
small amount of functionality has been added or changed.
Sub-minor version numbers are usually used for changes which
do not affect functionality, such as documentation
patches.</p>

<p>The most common CPAN version numbering scheme looks like
this:</p>

<p>1.00, 1.10, 1.11, 1.20, 1.30, 1.31, 1.32</p>

<p>A correct CPAN version number is a floating point number
with at least 2 digits after the decimal. You can test
whether it conforms to CPAN by using</p>

<p>perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le &rsquo;print
MM-&gt;parse_version(shift)&rsquo; &rsquo;Foo.pm&rsquo;</p>

<p>If you want to release a beta or alpha version of a
module but dont want CPAN.pm to list it as most recent use
an _ after the regular version number followed by at least 2
digits, eg. 1.20_01. If you do this, the following idiom is
recommended:</p>

<p>$VERSION = &quot;1.12_01&quot;; $XS_VERSION = $VERSION;
# only needed if you have XS code $VERSION = eval
$VERSION;</p>

<p>With that trick MakeMaker will only read the first line
and thus read the underscore, while the perl interpreter
will evaluate the $VERSION and convert the string into a
number. Later operations that treat $VERSION as a number
will then be able to do so without provoking a warning about
$VERSION not being a number.</p>

<p>Never release anything (even a one-word documentation
patch) without incrementing the number. Even a one-word
documentation patch should result in a change in version at
the sub-minor level.</p>

<p>Pre-requisites Module authors should carefully consider
whether to rely on other modules, and which modules to rely
on.</p>

<p>Most importantly, choose modules which are as stable as
possible. In order of preference:</p>

<p>&middot; Core Perl modules</p>

<p>&middot; Stable CPAN modules</p>

<p>&middot; Unstable CPAN modules</p>

<p>&middot; Modules not available from CPAN</p>

<p>Specify version requirements for other Perl modules in
the pre- requisites in your Makefile.PL or Build.PL.</p>

<p>Be sure to specify Perl version requirements both in
Makefile.PL or Build.PL and with &quot;require 5.6.1&quot;
or similar. See the section on &quot;use VERSION&quot; of
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for details.</p>

<p>Testing All modules should be tested before distribution
(using &quot;make disttest&quot;), and the tests should also
be available to people installing the modules (using
&quot;make test&quot;). For Module::Build you would use the
&quot;make test&quot; equivalent &quot;perl Build
test&quot;.</p>

<p>The importance of these tests is proportional to the
alleged stability of a module -- a module which purports to
be stable or which hopes to achieve wide use should adhere
to as strict a testing regime as possible.</p>

<p>Useful modules to help you write tests (with minimum
impact on your development process or your time) include
Test::Simple, Carp::Assert and Test::Inline. For more
sophisticated test suites there are Test::More and
Test::MockObject.</p>

<p>Packaging Modules should be packaged using one of the
standard packaging tools. Currently you have the choice
between ExtUtils::MakeMaker and the more platform
independent Module::Build, allowing modules to be installed
in a consistent manner. When using ExtUtils::MakeMaker, you
can use &quot;make dist&quot; to create your package. Tools
exist to help you to build your module in a
MakeMaker-friendly style. These include
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker and h2xs. See also perlnewmod.</p>

<p>Licensing Make sure that your module has a license, and
that the full text of it is included in the distribution
(unless its a common one and the terms of the license dont
require you to include it).</p>

<p>If you dont know what license to use, dual licensing
under the GPL and Artistic licenses (the same as Perl
itself) is a good idea. See perlgpl and perlartistic.</p>

<p>COMMON PITFALLS Reinventing the wheel There are certain
application spaces which are already very, very well served
by CPAN. One example is templating systems, another is date
and time modules, and there are many more. While it is a
rite of passage to write your own version of these things,
please consider carefully whether the Perl world really
needs you to publish it.</p>

<p>Trying to do too much Your module will be part of a
developers toolkit. It will not, in itself, form the entire
toolkit. It s tempting to add extra features until your code
is a monolithic system rather than a set of modular building
blocks.</p>

<p>Inappropriate documentation Dont fall into the trap of
writing for the wrong audience. Your primary audience is a
reasonably experienced developer with at least a moderate
understanding of your modules application domain, whos just
downloaded your module and wants to start using it as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Tutorials, end-user documentation, research papers, FAQs
etc are not appropriate in a module s main documentation. If
you really want to write these, include them as
sub-documents such as &quot;My::Module::Tutorial&quot; or
&quot;My::Module::FAQ&quot; and provide a link in the SEE
ALSO section of the main documentation.</p>
