<p>GIT-MERGE-INDEX(1) Git Manual GIT-MERGE-INDEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-merge-index - Run a merge for files needing
merging</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git merge-index [-o] [-q] &lt;merge-program&gt;
(-a | [--] &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This looks up the &lt;file&gt;(s) in the
index and, if there are any merge entries, passes the SHA1
hash for those files as arguments 1, 2, 3 (empty argument if
no file), and &lt;file&gt; as argument 4. File modes for the
three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -- Do not interpret any more arguments as
options.</p>

<p>-a Run merge against all files in the index that need
merging.</p>

<p>-o Instead of stopping at the first failed merge, do all
of them in one shot - continue with merging even when
previous merges returned errors, and only return the error
code after all the merges.</p>

<p>-q Do not complain about a failed merge program (a merge
program failure usually indicates conflicts during the
merge). This is for porcelains which might want to emit
custom messages.</p>

<p>If git merge-index is called with multiple &lt;file&gt;s
(or -a) then it processes them in turn only stopping if
merge returns a non-zero exit code.</p>

<p>Typically this is run with a script calling gits
imitation of the merge command from the RCS package.</p>

<p>A sample script called git merge-one-file is included in
the distribution.</p>

<p>ALERT ALERT ALERT! The git &quot;merge object
order&quot; is different from the RCS merge program merge
object order. In the above ordering, the original is first.
But the argument order to the 3-way merge program merge is
to have the original in the middle. Dont ask me why.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat MM
This is MM from the original tree. # original This is
modified MM in the branch A. # merge1 This is modified MM in
the branch B. # merge2 This is modified MM in the branch B.
# current contents</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat AA
MM cat: : No such file or directory This is added AA in the
branch A. This is added AA in the branch B. This is added AA
in the branch B. fatal: merge program failed</p>

<p>where the latter example shows how git merge-index will
stop trying to merge once anything has returned an error
(i.e., cat returned an error for the AA file, because it
didnt exist in the original, and thus git merge-index didnt
even try to merge the MM thing).</p>
