<p>XmTransferValue(library call) XmTransferValue(library
call)</p>

<p>NAME XmTransferValue A toolkit function that transfers
data to a destina- tion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;</p>

<p>void XmTransferValue( XtPointer transfer_id, Atom
target, XtCallbackProc proc, XtPointer client_data, Time
time);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTransferValue converts a selection,
transferring any data from the selection owner, in the
context of an already-initiated data transfer operation. An
application can call this routine from an XmNdestina-
tionCallback procedure or any function called as a
result.</p>

<p>The caller of XmTransferValue supplies the target to
which the selec- tion is converted. The caller also supplies
a callback procedure to handle the data that results from
the conversion.</p>

<p>transfer_id Specifies a unique indentifier for the data
transfer opera- tion. The value must be the same as the
value of the trans- fer_id member of the
XmDestinationCallbackStruct passed to the
XmNdestinationCallback procedure.</p>

<p>target Specifies the target to which the selection is to
be con- verted.</p>

<p>proc Specifies a callback procedure to be invoked when
the selec- tion has been converted and the data, if any, is
available. This procedure is responsible for inserting or
otherwise han- dling any data transferred. The procedure can
also terminate the data transfer by calling XmTransferDone.
The proc receives three arguments:</p>

<p>&middot; The widget that requested the conversion</p>

<p>&middot; The value of the client_data argument</p>

<p>&middot; A pointer to an XmSelectionCallbackStruct</p>

<p>This procedure can be called before or after
XmTransferValue returns.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies data to be passed to the callback
procedure (the value of the proc argument) when the
selection has been con- verted.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time of the XEvent that triggered the
data transfer. You should typically set this field to
XtLast- TimestampProcessed.</p>

<p>The callback procedure (the value of the proc argument)
receives a pointer to an XmSelectionCallbackStruct, which
has the following defi- nition:</p>

<p>typedef struct { int reason; XEvent *event; Atom
selection; Atom target; Atom type; XtPointer transfer_id;
int flags; int remaining; XtPointer value; unsigned long
length; int format; } XmSelectionCallbackStruct;</p>

<p>reason Indicates why the callback was invoked.</p>

<p>event Points to the XEvent that triggered the callback.
It can be NULL.</p>

<p>selection Specifies the selection that has been
converted.</p>

<p>target Specifies the target to which XmTransferValue
requested con- version. The value is the same as the value
of the target argument to XmTransferValue.</p>

<p>type Specifies the type of the selection value. This is
not the target, but the type used to represent the target.
The value XT_CONVERT_FAIL means that the selection owner did
not respond to the conversion request within the Intrinsics
selection timeout interval.</p>

<p>transfer_id Specifies a unique indentifier for the data
transfer opera- tion. The value is the same as the value of
the transfer_id argument to XmTransferValue.</p>

<p>flags This member is currently unused. The value is
always XmSE- LECTION_DEFAULT.</p>

<p>remaining Indicates the number of transfers remaining
for the operation specified by transfer_id.</p>

<p>value Represents the data transferred by this request.
The appli- cation is responsible for freeing the value by
calling XtFree.</p>

<p>length Indicates the number of elements of data in
value, where each element has the size symbolized by format.
If value is NULL, length is 0.</p>

<p>format Indicates whether the data in value should be
viewed as a list of char, short, or long quantities.
Possible values are 8 (for a list of char), 16 (for a list
of short), or 32 (for a list of long).</p>

<p>RELATED XmTransferSetParameters(3),
XmTransferSendRequest(3), and XmTransfer-
StartRequest(3).</p>
