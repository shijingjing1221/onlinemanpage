<p>EVIM(1) EVIM(1)</p>

<p>NAME evim - easy Vim, edit a file with Vim and setup for
modeless editing</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS evim [options] [file ..] eview</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION eVim starts Vim and sets options to make it
behave like a modeless edi- tor. This is still Vim but used
as a point-and-click editor. This feels a lot like using
Notepad on MS-Windows. eVim will always run in the GUI, to
enable the use of menus and toolbar.</p>

<p>Only to be used for people who really cant work with Vim
in the normal way. Editing will be much less efficient.</p>

<p>eview is the same, but starts in read-only mode. It
works just like evim -R.</p>

<p>See vim(1) for details about Vim, options, etc.</p>

<p>The insertmode option is set to be able to type text
directly. Mappings are setup to make Copy and Paste work
with the MS-Windows keys. CTRL-X cuts text, CTRL-C copies
text and CTRL-V pastes text. Use CTRL-Q to obtain the
original meaning of CTRL-V.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See vim(1).</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/vim/vim74/evim.vim The script loaded to
initialize eVim.</p>

<p>AKA Also Known As &quot;Vim for gumbies&quot;. When
using evim you are expected to take a handkerchief, make a
knot in each corner and wear it on your head.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO vim(1)</p>

<p>AUTHOR Most of Vim was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a
lot of help from others. See the Help/Credits menu.</p>
