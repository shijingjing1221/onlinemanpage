<p>NAME yapp - A perl frontend to the Parse::Yapp
module</p>

<p>SYNOPSYS yapp [options] grammar[.yp]</p>

<p>yapp -V</p>

<p>yapp -h</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION yapp is a frontend to the Parse::Yapp
module, which lets you compile Parse::Yapp grammar input
files into Perl LALR(1) OO parser modules.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options, as of today, are all optionals :-)</p>

<p>-v Creates a file grammar.output describing your parser.
It will show you a summary of conflicts, rules, the DFA
(Deterministic Finite Automaton) states and overall usage of
the parser.</p>

<p>-s Create a standalone module in which the driver is
included. Note that if you have more than one parser module
called from a program, to have it standalone, you need this
option only for one of your parser module.</p>

<p>-n Disable source file line numbering embedded in your
parser module. I dont know why one should need it, but its
there.</p>

<p>-m module Gives your parser module the package name (or
name space or module name or class name or
whatever-you-call-it) of module. It defaults to grammar</p>

<p>-o outfile The compiled output file will be named
outfile for your parser module. It defaults to grammar.pm
or, if you specified the option -m A::Module::Name (see
below), to Name.pm.</p>

<p>-t filename The -t filename option allows you to specify
a file which should be used as template for generating the
parser output. The default is to use the internal template
defined in Parse::Yapp::Output.pm. For how to write your own
template and which substitutions are available, have a look
to the module Parse::Yapp::Output.pm : it should be
obvious.</p>

<p>-b shebang If you work on systems that understand so
called shebangs, and your generated parser is directly an
executable script, you can specifie one with the -b option,
ie:</p>

<p>yapp -b &rsquo;/usr/local/bin/perl -w&rsquo; -o
myscript.pl myscript.yp</p>

<p>This will output a file called myscript.pl whose very
first line is:</p>

<p>#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w</p>

<p>The argument is mandatory, but if you specify an empty
string, the value of $Config{perlpath} will be used
instead.</p>

<p>grammar The input grammar file. If no suffix is given,
and the file does not exists, an attempt to open the file
with a suffix of .yp is tried before exiting.</p>

<p>-V Display current version of Parse::Yapp and gracefully
exits.</p>

<p>-h Display the usage screen.</p>

<p>BUGS None known now :-)</p>
