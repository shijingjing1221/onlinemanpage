<p>NAME gimprc - gimp configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gimprc file is a configuration file read
by GIMP when it starts up. There are two of these: one
system-wide one stored in /etc/gimp/2.0/gimprc and a
per-user $HOME/.gimp-2.6/gimprc which may override system
settings.</p>

<p>Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue
until the end of the line. Blank lines are ignored.</p>

<p>The gimprc file associates values with properties. These
properties may be set by lisp-like assignments of the
form:</p>

<p>(property-name value)</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>property-name is one of the property names described
below.</p>

<p>value is the value the property is to be set to.</p>

<p>Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the name
from the value.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES Valid properties and their default values
are:</p>

<p>(temp-path &quot;${gimp_dir}/tmp&quot;)</p>

<p>Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear
here during the course of running GIMP. Most files will
disappear when GIMP exits, but some files are likely to
remain, so it is best if this folder not be one that is
shared by other users. This is a single folder.</p>

<p>(swap-path &quot;${gimp_dir}&quot;)</p>

<p>Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based
memory allo- cation scheme. The swap file is used to quickly
and easily swap tiles out to disk and back in. Be aware that
the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with
large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap
file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS. For
these reasons, it may be desirable to put your swap file in
&quot;/tmp&quot;. This is a single folder.</p>

<p>(num-processors 1)</p>

<p>Sets how many processors GIMP should try to use
simultaneously. This is an integer value.</p>

<p>(tile-cache-size 1024M)</p>

<p>When the amount of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP
will start to swap tiles to disk. This is a lot slower but
it makes it possible to work on images that wouldnt fit into
memory oth- erwise. If you have a lot of RAM, you may want
to set this to a higher value. The integer size can contain
a suffix of B, K, M or G which makes GIMP interpret the size
as being specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or
gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the size defaults to
being specified in kilobytes.</p>

<p>(interpolation-type cubic)</p>

<p>Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and
other transformations. Possible values are none, linear,
cubic and lanczos.</p>

<p>(plug-in-path

<p>Specify a default image grid. This is a parameter
list.</p>

<p>(undo-levels 5)</p>

undone. More undo levels are kept available until the
undo-size limit is reached. This is an integer value.</p>

<p>(undo-size 64M)</p>

<p>Sets an upper limit to the memory that is used per image
to keep operations on the undo stack. Regardless of this
setting, at least as many undo-levels as configured can be
undone. The integer size can contain a suffix of B, K, M or
G which makes GIMP interpret the size as being specified in
bytes, kilo- bytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is
specified the size defaults to being specified in
kilobytes.</p>

<p>(undo-preview-size large)</p>

<p>Sets the size of the previews in the Undo History.
Possible values are tiny, extra-small, small, medium, large,
extra-large, huge, enormous and gigantic.</p>

nice to have but they can slow things down when working with
large images. Pos- sible values are yes and no.</p>

<p>Sets the preview size used for layers and channel
previews in newly created dialogs. Possible values are tiny,

<p>The thumbnail in the Open dialog will be automatically
updated if the file being previewed is smaller than the size
set here. The integer size can contain a suffix of B, K, M
or G which makes GIMP interpret the size as being specified
in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is
specified the size defaults to being specified in
kilobytes.</p>

<p>(install-colormap no)</p>

<p>Install a private colormap; might be useful on 8-bit
(256 col- ors) displays. Possible values are yes and no.</p>

the mini- mum number of system colors allocated for GIMP.

snapping activates. This is an integer value.</p>

value is in milliseconds (less time indicates faster
marching). This is an integer value.</p>

<p>When enabled, the image window will automatically resize
itself when zooming into and out of images. Possible values
are yes and no.</p>

<p>(resize-windows-on-resize no)</p>

<p>When enabled, the image window will automatically resize
itself whenever the physical image size changes. Possible
values are yes and no.</p>

<p>(default-dot-for-dot yes)</p>

<p>When enabled, this will ensure that each pixel of an
image gets mapped to a pixel on the screen. Possible values
are yes and no.</p>

<p>(initial-zoom-to-fit yes)</p>

<p>When enabled, this will ensure that the full image is
visible after a file is opened, otherwise it will be
displayed with a scale of 1:1. Possible values are yes and
no.</p>

<p>(perfect-mouse yes)</p>

<p>When enabled, the X server is queried for the mouses
current position on each motion event, rather than relying
on the posi- tion hint. This means painting with large
brushes should be more accurate, but it may be slower.
Perversely, on some X servers enabling this option results
in faster painting. Possi- ble values are yes and no.</p>

<p>(cursor-mode tool-icon)</p>

<p>Sets the type of mouse pointers to use. Possible values
are tool-icon, tool-crosshair and crosshair.</p>

<p>(cursor-updating yes)</p>

enabled by default. However, they require overhead that you
may want to do without. Possible values are yes and no.</p>

image while using a paint tool. Possible values are yes and
no.</p>

the range of 0.0 to 1.0.</p>

is greater than a specified threshold. This value represents
the default thresh- old. This is an integer value.</p>

<p>(move-tool-changes-active no)</p>

ver- sions. Possible values are yes and no.</p>

an image that would take more memory than the size specified
here. The integer size can contain a suffix of B, K, M or G
which makes GIMP interpret the size as being specified in
bytes, kilo- bytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is

expanded to the users home directory. Note that the bash
feature of being able to refer to other users home
directories by writing ~userid/ is not valid in this
file.</p>

<p>${variable} is expanded to the current value of an
environment vari- able. There are a few variables that are
