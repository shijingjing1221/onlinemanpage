<p>UUID_GENERATE(3) Libuuid API UUID_GENERATE(3)</p>

<p>NAME uuid_generate, uuid_generate_random,
uuid_generate_time, uuid_gener- ate_time_safe - create a new
unique UUID value</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;uuid/uuid.h&gt;</p>

<p>void uuid_generate(uuid_t out); void
uuid_generate_random(uuid_t out); void
uuid_generate_time(uuid_t out); int
uuid_generate_time_safe(uuid_t out);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The uuid_generate function creates a new
universally unique identifier (UUID). The uuid will be
generated based on high-quality randomness from
/dev/urandom, if available. If it is not available, then
uuid_generate will use an alternative algorithm which uses
the current time, the local ethernet MAC address (if
available), and random data generated using a pseudo-random
generator.</p>

<p>The uuid_generate_random function forces the use of the
all-random UUID format, even if a high-quality random number
generator (i.e., /dev/urandom) is not available, in which
case a pseudo-random generator will be substituted. Note
that the use of a pseudo-random generator may compromise the
uniqueness of UUIDs generated in this fashion.</p>

<p>The uuid_generate_time function forces the use of the
alternative algo- rithm which uses the current time and the
local ethernet MAC address (if available). This algorithm
used to be the default one used to gen- erate UUID, but
because of the use of the ethernet MAC address, it can leak
information about when and where the UUID was generated.
This can cause privacy problems in some applications, so the
uuid_generate func- tion only uses this algorithm if a
high-quality source of randomness is not available. To
guarantee uniqueness of UUIDs generated by concur- rently
running processes, the uuid library uses global clock state
counter (if the process has permissions to gain exclusive
access to this file) and/or the uuidd daemon, if it is
running already or can be be spawned by the process (if
installed and the process has enough per- missions to run
it). If neither of these two synchronization mecha- nisms
can be used, it is theoretically possible that two
concurrently running processes obtain the same UUID(s). To
tell whether the UUID has been generated in a safe manner,
use uuid_generate_time_safe.</p>

<p>The uuid_generate_time_safe is similar to
uuid_generate_time, except that it returns a value which
denotes whether any of the synchroniza- tion mechanisms (see
above) has been used.</p>

<p>The UUID is 16 bytes (128 bits) long, which gives
approximately 3.4x10^38 unique values (there are
approximately 10^80 elementary par- ticles in the universe
according to Carl Sagans Cosmos). The new UUID can
reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created on
the local system, and among UUIDs created on other systems
in the past and in the future.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The newly created UUID is returned in the
memory location pointed to by out. uuid_generate_time_safe
returns zero if the UUID has been gener- ated in a safe
manner, -1 otherwise.</p>
