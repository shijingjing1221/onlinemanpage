<p>sane-mustek_usb(5) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy
sane-mustek_usb(5)</p>

<p>NAME sane-mustek_usb - SANE backend for Mustek USB
flatbed scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sane-mustek_usb library implements a
SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access
to Mustek USB flatbed scanners (including a clone from
Trust). At present, the following scanners are known to work
more or less with this backend:</p>

<p>Mustek 600 CU Mustek 1200 UB Mustek 1200 CU Mustek 1200
CU Plus Trust Compact Scan USB 19200</p>

<p>More details can be found on the Mustek USB backend
homepage
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/mustek_usb-backend/.</p>

<p>The Mustek BearPaw 1200 and 2400 scanners are supported
by the plustek backend. See sane-plustek(5) for details. The
Mustek BearPaw 1200F is supported by the MA-1509 backend.
See sane-ma1509(5) for details. Other Mustek USB scanners
are supported by the gt68xx backend, see sane-gt68xx(5).</p>

<p>This backend can only work with scanners that are
already detected by the operating system. See sane-usb(5)
for details.</p>

<p>If you own a Mustek (or Trust) scanner other than the
ones listed above that works with this backend, please let
me know this by sending the scanners exact model name and
the USB vendor and device ids (e.g. from
/proc/bus/usb/devices or syslog) to me.</p>

<p>DEVICE NAMES This backend expects device names of the
form:</p>

<p>special</p>

<p>Where special is a path-name for the special device that
corresponds to a USB scanner. With Linux, such a device name
could be /dev/usb/scan- ner0 or /dev/usbscanner1, for
example.</p>

<p>For FreeBSD use /dev/uscanner0.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The contents of the mustek_usb.conf file
is a list of options and device names that correspond to
Mustek USB scanners. Empty lines and lines starting with a
hash mark (#) are ignored. If a device name is placed in
mustek_usb.conf, it must be followed by a line containing
the keyword option and an option specifying the scanner
type. The following options can be used: 600cu, 1200cu,
1200cu_plus, 1200ub. For the Trust Compact Scan USB 19200
use option 1200ub.</p>

<p>Instead of using the device name, the scanner can be
autodetected by usb vendor_id product_id statements which
are already included into mustek_usb.conf. This is only
supported with Linux 2.4.8 and higher and all systems that
support libsub. &quot;vendor_id&quot; and
&quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify
the scanner. If this doesnt work, a device name and the
option specifying the scanner type must be placed in
mustek_usb.conf as described above.</p>

<p>The global option max_block_size can be used to limit
the amount of data acquired in one turn from the USB system.
It may be worth trying, if USB errors occur.</p>

<p>A sample configuration file is shown below:</p>

<p># Comment option max_block_size 1024 usb 0x055f 0x0001
/dev/usb/scanner0 option 600cu</p>

<p>The first line is ignored. The second line sets the
buffer size to a maximum of 1024 bytes. The third line tries
to autodetect a scanner with vendor id 0x055f and product id
0x0001 (Mustek 1200 CU). The fourth line tells the backend
to attach to /dev/usb/scanner0 and the fifth line specifies
that /dev/usb/scanner0 is a Mustek 600 CU.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/mustek_usb.conf The backend
configuration file (see also description of SANE_CONFIG_DIR
below).</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-mustek_usb.a The static library
implementing this backend.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-mustek_usb.so The shared library
implementing this backend (present on systems that support
dynamic loading).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SANE_CONFIG_DIR This environment variable
specifies the list of directories that may contain the
configuration file. Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (:), under OS/2, they are separated by
a semi-colon (;). If this variable is not set, the config-
uration file is searched in two default directories: first,
the current working directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in
/etc/sane.d. If the value of the environment variable ends
with the directory sepa- rator character, then the default
directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to
&quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories
&quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).</p>

<p>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB If the library was compiled with
debug support enabled, this environment variable controls
the debug level for this backend. Higher debug levels
increase the verbosity of the output.</p>

<p>Value Description 0 no output 1 print fatal errors 2
print important messages 3 print non-fatal errors and less
important messages 4 print all but debugging messages 5
print high level debugging messages 6 print medium level
debugging messages 7 print low level debugging messages</p>

<p>Example: export SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_USB=4</p>

<p>AUTHOR Henning Meier-Geinitz
&lt;henning@meier-geinitz.de&gt; This backend is based on
the Mustek 1200ub backend from Mustek, main- tained by Tom
Wang.</p>

<p>BUGS These devices have a hardware bug: Once data is
written to them, they cant be reset (toggle = DATA0). That
means, any operation that tries to reset the device will
result in running into timeouts.</p>

<p>In earlier versions this backend failed when it was
loaded the second time in some configurations. The only
choice was to replug the scanner in this case. The backend
uses a workaround for that bug now but its only tested on
Linux. Reports for other operating systems are appreci-
ated.</p>

<p>More detailed bug information is available at the Mustek
backend home- page
