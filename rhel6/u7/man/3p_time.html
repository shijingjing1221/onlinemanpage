<p>TIME(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TIME(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME time - get time</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>time_t time(time_t *tloc);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The time() function shall return the value
of time in seconds since the Epoch.</p>

<p>The tloc argument points to an area where the return
value is also stored. If tloc is a null pointer, no value is
stored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, time() shall
return the value of time. Oth- erwise, (time_t)-1 shall be
returned.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Getting the Current Time The following example
uses the time() function to calculate the time elapsed, in
seconds, since the Epoch, localtime() to convert that value
to a broken-down time, and asctime() to convert the
broken-down time values into a printable string.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main(void) { time_t result;</p>

<p>result = time(NULL); printf(&quot;%s%ju secs since the
Epocn&quot;, asctime(localtime(&amp;result)),
(uintmax_t)result); return(0); }</p>

<p>This example writes the current time to stdout in a form
like this:</p>

<p>Wed Jun 26 10:32:15 1996 835810335 secs since the
Epoch</p>

<p>Timing an Event The following example gets the current
time, prints it out in the users format, and prints the
number of minutes to an event being timed.</p>

<p>#include &lt;time.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ...
time_t now; int minutes_to_event; ... time(&amp;now);
minutes_to_event = ...; printf(&quot;The time is &quot;);
puts(asctime(localtime(&amp;now))); printf(&quot;There are
%d minutes to the eventn&quot;, minutes_to_event); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The time() function returns a value in seconds
(type time_t) while times() returns a set of values in clock
ticks (type clock_t). Some historical implementations, such
as 4.3 BSD, have mechanisms capable of returning more
precise times (see below). A generalized timing scheme to
unify these various timing mechanisms has been proposed but
not adopted.</p>

<p>Implementations in which time_t is a 32-bit signed
integer (many his- torical implementations) fail in the year
2038. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not address this problem.
However, the use of the time_t type is mandated in order to
ease the eventual fix.</p>

<p>The use of the &lt;time.h&gt; header instead of
&lt;sys/types.h&gt; allows compati- bility with the ISO C
standard.</p>

<p>Many historical implementations (including Version 7)
and the 1984 /usr/group standard use long instead of time_t.
This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 uses the latter type in
order to agree with the ISO C standard.</p>

<p>4.3 BSD includes time() only as an alternate function to
the more flex- ible gettimeofday() function.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS In a future version of this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, time_t is likely to be required to be
capable of representing times far in the future. Whether
this will be mandated as a 64-bit type or a requirement that
a specific date in the future be representable (for example,
10000 AD) is not yet determined. Systems purchased after the
approval of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 should be
evaluated to determine whether their lifetime will extend
past 2038.</p>
