<p>NAME loopctrl - configure isdnloop ISDN driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS loopctrl [-d Driver-Id] action options ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION loopctrl is used to setup the isdnloop ISDN
driver.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Driver-Id selects the virtual S0 interface
named by Driver-Id. Driver-Ids are defined during driver
initialisation. See isdnloop(4) for a description of the
syntax to be used for modularised and mono- lithic driver
versions. This option must be used to identify the virtual
S0 interface if more than one S0 interface is exis- tent. If
a single virtual S0 interface is used, it may be omit- ted.
If using more than one virtual card, support for the other
cards is enabled with the add action of loopctrl. Ids may
not start with digits or small x, because these values are
misinter- preted as numeric parameters by insmod. For
loading the module, always the newest modutils package
should be used to avoid prob- lems during load.</p>

<p>The following actions may be given to loopctrl.</p>

<p>add [id] enables support for an additional virtual card
in the driver. If id is missing, adds a card with an id
given by the system. with id given, adds a card with an Id
given by the user. Ids are checked against conflicts, and if
a conflict happens, replaced by the system in the same
manner as if no Id was supplied.</p>

<p>leased on|off switches between normal (dialup) and
leased-line mode. Leased- line mode is intended for usage
with S64K-lines or - if both channels are used - for S02.
These lines do not have a D-chan- nel. When leased-line mode
is enabled, the driver simulates incoming calls using
special &quot;phone-numbers&quot; for calling and called
address which are generated as follows:</p>

<p>Calling number: LEASEDx where x is the internal
slot-number of the S0 interface. This number starts with 0
for the first S0 interface and is incremented by one for
every S0 interface configured using the add action.</p>

<p>Called number: x where x is equal to the channel number
of the calling S0 interface starting with 1.</p>

<p>start protocol phone1 [phone2 phone3] starts the driver
with the given D-channel protocol. If protocol is 1tr6, only
phone1 has to be given. It is meant to be the base number of
the virtual S0 interface to which the EAZ is appended. If
protocol is dss1, phone1, phone2 and phone3 have to be given
and represent the three MSNs of the virtual S0
interface.</p>

<p>dump is available if the program is configured using the
--enable- dump option only. The contents of internal driver
variables is dumped on stdout.</p>

<p>BUGS This program and the isdnloop driver are ALPHA
code. The main intention for this driver is for testing the
link level and applications.</p>
