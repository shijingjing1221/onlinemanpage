<p>LOCALE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual LOCALE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME locale - get locale-specific information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS locale [-a| -m]</p>

<p>locale [-ck] name...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The locale utility shall write information
about the current locale environment, or all public locales,
to the standard output. For the purposes of this section, a
public locale is one provided by the imple- mentation that
is accessible to the application.</p>

<p>When locale is invoked without any arguments, it shall
summarize the current locale environment for each locale
category as determined by the settings of the environment
variables defined in the Base Defini- tions volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7, Locale.</p>

<p>When invoked with operands, it shall write values that
have been assigned to the keywords in the locale categories,
as follows:</p>

<p>* Specifying a keyword name shall select the named
keyword and the category containing that keyword.</p>

<p>* Specifying a category name shall select the named
category and all keywords in that category.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The locale utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-a Write information about all available public locales.
The avail- able locales shall include POSIX, representing
the POSIX locale. The manner in which the implementation
determines what other locales are available is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>-c Write the names of selected locale categories; see
the STDOUT section. The -c option increases readability when
more than one category is selected (for example, via more
than one keyword name or via a category name). It is valid
both with and without the -k option.</p>

<p>-k Write the names and values of selected keywords. The
implementa- tion may omit values for some keywords; see the
OPERANDS sec- tion.</p>

<p>-m Write names of available charmaps; see the Base
Definitions vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1,
Portable Character Set.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>name The name of a locale category as defined in the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 7,
Locale, the name of a keyword in a locale category, or the
reserved name charmap. The named category or keyword shall
be selected for output. If a single name represents both a
locale category name and a keyword name in the current
locale, the results are unspecified. Other- wise, both
category and keyword names can be specified as name
operands, in any sequence. It is implementation-defined
whether any keyword values are written for the categories
LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of locale:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the LANG, LC_*, and
NLSPATH envi- ronment variables specify the current locale
environment to be written out; they shall be used if the -a
option is not specified.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If locale is invoked without any options or
operands, the names and values of the LANG and LC_*
environment variables described in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 shall be written to the standard output, one
variable per line, with LANG first, and each line using the
follow- ing format. Only those variables set in the
environment and not over- ridden by LC_ALL shall be written
using this format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s=%n&quot;, &lt;variable_name&gt;,
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>The names of those LC_* variables associated with locale
categories defined in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
that are not set in the environment or are overridden by
LC_ALL shall be written in the follow- ing format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s=</p>

<p>The &lt;implied value&gt; shall be the name of the
locale that has been selected for that category by the
implementation, based on the values in LANG and LC_ALL, as
described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p>The &lt;value&gt; and &lt;implied value&gt; shown above
shall be properly quoted for possible later reentry to the
shell. The &lt;value&gt; shall not be quoted using
double-quotes (so that it can be distinguished by the user
from the &lt;implied value&gt; case, which always requires
double-quotes).</p>

<p>The LC_ALL variable shall be written last, using the
first format shown above. If it is not set, it shall be
written as:</p>

<p>&quot;LC_ALLn&quot;</p>

<p>If any arguments are specified:</p>

<p>1. If the -a option is specified, the names of all the
public locales shall be written, each in the following
format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;locale name&gt;</p>

<p>2. If the -c option is specified, the names of all
selected categories shall be written, each in the following
format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;category name&gt;</p>

<p>If keywords are also selected for writing (see following
items), the category name output shall precede the keyword
output for that cate- gory.</p>

<p>If the -c option is not specified, the names of the
categories shall not be written; only the keywords, as
selected by the &lt;name&gt; operand, shall be written.</p>

<p>3. If the -k option is specified, the names and values
of selected keywords shall be written. If a value is
non-numeric, it shall be written in the following
format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s=</p>

<p>If the keyword was charmap, the name of the charmap (if
any) that was specified via the localedef -f option when the
locale was created shall be written, with the word charmap
as &lt;keyword name&gt;.</p>

<p>If a value is numeric, it shall be written in one of the
following for- mats:</p>

<p>&quot;%s=%n&quot;, &lt;keyword name&gt;, &lt;keyword
value&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;%s=%c%n&quot;, &lt;keyword name&gt;, &lt;escape
character&gt;, &lt;keyword value&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;%s=%cx%n&quot;, &lt;keyword name&gt;, &lt;escape
character&gt;, &lt;keyword value&gt;</p>

<p>where the &lt;escape character&gt; is that identified by
the escape_char key- word in the current locale; see the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
7.3, Locale Definition.</p>

<p>Compound keyword values (list entries) shall be
separated in the output by semicolons. When included in
keyword values, the semicolon, the dou- ble-quote, the
backslash, and any control character shall be preceded
(escaped) with the escape character.</p>

<p>4. If the -k option is not specified, selected keyword
values shall be written, each in the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;keyword value&gt;</p>

<p>If the keyword was charmap, the name of the charmap (if
any) that was specified via the localedef -f option when the
locale was created shall be written.</p>

<p>5. If the -m option is specified, then a list of all
available charmaps shall be written, each in the format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;charmap&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;charmap&gt; is in a format suitable for use as
the option-argument to the localedef -f option.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All the requested information was found and output
successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the LANG environment variable is
not set or set to an empty value, or one of the LC_*
environment variables is set to an unrecognized value, the
actual locales assumed (if any) are implementation-defined
as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.</p>

<p>Implementations are not required to write out the actual
values for keywords in the categories LC_CTYPE and
LC_COLLATE ; however, they must write out the categories
(allowing an application to determine, for example, which
character classes are available).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES In the following examples, the assumption is
that locale environment variables are set as follows:</p>

<p>LANG=locale_x LC_COLLATE=locale_y</p>

<p>The command locale would result in the following
output:</p>

<p>LANG=locale_x LC_CTYPE=&quot;locale_x&quot;
LC_COLLATE=locale_y LC_TIME=&quot;locale_x&quot;
LC_NUMERIC=&quot;locale_x&quot;
LC_MONETARY=&quot;locale_x&quot;
LC_MESSAGES=&quot;locale_x&quot; LC_ALL=</p>

<p>The order of presentation of the categories is not
specified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>LC_ALL=POSIX locale -ck decimal_point</p>

<p>would produce:</p>

<p>LC_NUMERIC decimal_point=&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>The following command shows an application of locale to
determine whether a user-supplied response is
affirmative:</p>

<p>if printf &quot;%n&quot; &quot;$response&quot; | grep
-Eq &quot;$(locale yesexpr)&quot; then affirmative
processing goes here else non-affirmative processing goes
here fi</p>

<p>RATIONALE The output for categories LC_CTYPE and
LC_COLLATE has been made imple- mentation-defined because
there is a questionable value in having a shell script
receive an entire array of characters. It is also diffi-
cult to return a logical collation description, short of
returning a complete localedef source.</p>

<p>The -m option was included to allow applications to
query for the exis- tence of charmaps. The output is a list
of the charmaps (implementa- tion-supplied and
user-supplied, if any) on the system.</p>

<p>The -c option was included for readability when more
than one category is selected (for example, via more than
one keyword name or via a cate- gory name). It is valid both
with and without the -k option.</p>

<p>The charmap keyword, which returns the name of the
charmap (if any) that was used when the current locale was
created, was included to allow applications needing the
information to retrieve it.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
