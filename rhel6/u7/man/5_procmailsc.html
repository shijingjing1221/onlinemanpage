<p>NAME procmailsc - procmail weighted scoring
technique</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS [*] w^x condition</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION In addition to the traditional true or false
conditions you can specify on a recipe, you can use a
weighted scoring technique to decide if a certain recipe
matches or not. When weighted scoring is used in a recipe,
then the final score for that recipe must be positive for it
to match.</p>

<p>A certain condition can contribute to the score if you
allocate it a weight (w) and an exponent (x). You do this by
preceding the con- dition (on the same line) with: w^x
Whereas both w and x are real numbers between -2147483647.0
and 2147483647.0 inclusive.</p>

<p>Weighted regular expression conditions The first time
the regular expression is found, it will add w to the score.
The second time it is found, w*x will be added. The third
time it is found, w*x*x will be added. The fourth time
w*x*x*x will be added. And so forth.</p>

<p>This can be described by the following concise
formula:</p>

<p>n n k-1 x - 1 w * Sum x = w * ------- k=1 x - 1</p>

<p>It represents the total added score for this condition
if n matches are found.</p>

<p>Note that the following case distinctions can be
made:</p>

<p>x=0 Only the first match will contribute w to the score.
Any sub- sequent matches are ignored.</p>

<p>x=1 Every match will contribute the same w to the score.
The score grows linearly with the number of matches
found.</p>

<p>0&lt;x&lt;1 Every match will contribute less to the
score than the previous one. The score will asymptotically
approach a certain value (see the NOTES section below).</p>

<p>1&lt;x Every match will contribute more to the score
than the previous one. The score will grow
exponentially.</p>

<p>x&lt;0 Can be utilised to favour odd or even number of
matches.</p>

<p>If the regular expression is negated (i.e., matches if
it isnt found), then n obviously can either be zero or
one.</p>

<p>Weighted program conditions If the program returns an
exitcode of EXIT_SUCCESS (=0), then the total added score
will be w. If it returns any other exitcode (indicating
failure), the total added score will be x.</p>

<p>If the exitcode of the program is negated, then, the
exitcode will be considered as if it were a virtual number
of matches. Calculation of the added score then proceeds as
if it had been a normal regular expression with
nexitcodematches.</p>

<p>Weighted length conditions If the length of the actual
mail is M then:</p>

<p>* w^x &gt; L</p>

<p>will generate an additional score of:</p>

<p>x / M w * | --- | L /</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>* w^x &lt; L</p>

<p>will generate an additional score of:</p>

<p>x / L w * | --- | M /</p>

<p>In both cases, if L=M, this will add w to the score. In
the former case however, larger mails will be favoured, in
the latter case, smaller mails will be favoured. Although x
can be varied to fine-tune the steepness of the function,
typical usage sets x=1.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS You can query the final score of all the
conditions on a recipe from the environment variable $=.
This variable is set every time just after procmail has
parsed all conditions on a recipe (even if the recipe is not
being executed).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following recipe will ditch all mails
having more than 150 lines in the body. The first condition
contains an empty regular expression which, because it
always matches, is used to give our score a negative offset.
The second condition then matches every line in the mail,
and consumes up the previous negative offset we gave (one
point per line). In the end, the score will only be positive
if the mail contained more than 150 lines.</p>

<p>:0 Bh * -150^0 * 1^1 ^.*$ /dev/null</p>

<p>Suppose you have a priority folder which you always read
first. The next recipe picks out the priority mail and files
them in this special folder. The first condition is a
regular one, i.e., it doesnt con- tribute to the score, but
simply has to be satisfied. The other condi- tions describe
things like: john and claire usually have something
important to say, meetings are usually important, replies
are favoured a bit, mails about Elvis (this is merely an
example :-) are favoured (the more he is mentioned, the more
the mail is favoured, but the maxi- mum extra score due to
Elvis will be 4000, no matter how often he is mentioned),
lots of quoted lines are disliked, smileys are appreciated
(the score for those will reach a maximum of 3500), those
three people usually dont send interesting mails, the mails
should preferably be small (e.g., 2000 bytes long mails will
score -100, 4000 bytes long mails do -800). As you see, if
some of the uninteresting people send mail, then the mail
still has a chance of landing in the priority folder, e.g.,
if it is about a meeting, or if it contains at least two
smileys.</p>

<p>:0 HB * !^Precedence:.*(junk|bulk) * 2000^0
^From:.*(john@home|claire@work) * 2000^0 ^Subject:.*meeting
* 300^0 ^Subject:.*Re: * 1000^.75 elvis|presley * -100^1
^&gt; * 350^.9 :- * -500^0 ^From:.*(boss|jane|henry)@work *
-100^3 &gt; 2000 priority_folder</p>

<p>If you are subscribed to a mailinglist, and just would
like to read the quality mails, then the following recipes
could do the trick. First we make sure that the mail is
coming from the mailinglist. Then we check if it is from
certain persons of whom we value the opinion, or about a
subject we absolutely want to know everything about. If it
is, file it. Otherwise, check if the ratio of quoted lines
to original lines is at most 1:2. If it exceeds that, ditch
the mail. Everything that sur- vived the previous test, is
filed.</p>

<p>:0 ^From mailinglist-request@some.where { :0: *
^(From:.*(paula|bill)|Subject:.*skiing) mailinglist</p>

<p>:0 Bh * 20^1 ^&gt; * -10^1 ^[^&gt;] /dev/null</p>

<p>:0: mailinglist }</p>

<p>For further examples you should look in the
procmailex(5) man page.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Because this speeds up the search by an order of
magnitude, the proc- mail internal egrep will always search
for the leftmost shortest match, unless it is determining
what to assign to MATCH, in which case it searches the
leftmost longest match. E.g. for the leftmost shortest
match, by itself, the regular expression:</p>

<p>.* will always match a zero length string at the same
spot.</p>

<p>.+ will always match one character (except newlines of
course).</p>

sh(1), csh(1), egrep(1), grep(1),</p>

<p>BUGS If, in a length condition, you specify an x that
causes an overflow, procmail is at the mercy of the pow(3)
function in your mathematical library.</p>

<p>Floating point numbers in engineering format (e.g.,
12e5) are not ac- cepted.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS As soon as plus infinity (2147483647) is
reached, any subsequent weighted conditions will simply be
skipped.</p>

<p>As soon as minus infinity (-2147483647) is reached, the
condition will be considered as no match and the recipe will
terminate early.</p>

<p>NOTES If in a regular expression weighted formula
0&lt;x&lt;1, the total added score for this condition will
asymptotically approach:</p>

<p>w ------- 1 - x</p>

<p>In order to reach half the maximum value you need</p>

<p>- ln 2 n = -------- ln x</p>

<p>matches.</p>
