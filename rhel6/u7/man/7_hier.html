<p>HIER(7) Linux Programmer s Manual HIER(7)</p>

<p>NAME hier - Description of the file system hierarchy</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A typical Linux system has, among others,
the following directories:</p>

<p>/ This is the root directory. This is where the whole
tree starts.</p>

<p>/bin This directory contains executable programs which
are needed in single user mode and to bring the system up or
repair it.</p>

<p>/boot Contains static files for the boot loader. This
directory only holds the files which are needed during the
boot process. The map installer and configuration files
should go to /sbin and /etc.</p>

<p>/dev Special or device files, which refer to physical
devices. See mknod(1).</p>

<p>/etc Contains configuration files which are local to the
machine. Some larger software packages, like X11, can have
their own sub- directories below /etc. Site-wide
configuration files may be placed here or in /usr/etc.
Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in
/etc and you may have links for these files to /usr/etc.</p>

<p>/etc/opt Host-specific configuration files for add-on
applications installed in /opt.</p>

<p>/etc/sgml This directory contains the configuration
files for SGML and XML (optional).</p>

<p>/etc/skel When a new user account is created, files from
this directory are usually copied into the users home
directory.</p>

<p>/etc/X11 Configuration files for the X11 window system
(optional).</p>

<p>/home On machines with home directories for users, these
are usually beneath this directory, directly or not. The
structure of this directory depends on local administration
decisions.</p>

<p>/lib This directory should hold those shared libraries
that are nec- essary to boot the system and to run the
commands in the root file system.</p>

<p>/media This directory contains mount points for
removable media such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.</p>

<p>/mnt This directory is a mount point for a temporarily
mounted file system. In some distributions, /mnt contains
subdirectories intended to be used as mount points for
several temporary file systems.</p>

<p>/opt This directory should contain add-on packages that
contain static files.</p>

<p>/proc This is a mount point for the proc file system,
which provides information about running processes and the
kernel. This pseudo-file system is described in more detail
in proc(5).</p>

<p>/root This directory is usually the home directory for
the root user (optional).</p>

<p>/sbin Like /bin, this directory holds commands needed to
boot the sys- tem, but which are usually not executed by
normal users.</p>

<p>/srv This directory contains site-specific data that is
served by this system.</p>

<p>/tmp This directory contains temporary files which may
be deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or at
system boot up.</p>

<p>/usr This directory is usually mounted from a separate
partition. It should hold only sharable, read-only data, so
that it can be mounted by various machines running
Linux.</p>

<p>/usr/X11R6 The X-Window system, version 11 release 6
(optional).</p>

<p>/usr/X11R6/bin Binaries which belong to the X-Window
system; often, there is a symbolic link from the more
traditional /usr/bin/X11 to here.</p>

<p>/usr/X11R6/lib Data files associated with the X-Window
system.</p>

<p>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11 These contain miscellaneous files
needed to run X; Often, there is a symbolic link from
/usr/lib/X11 to this directory.</p>

<p>/usr/X11R6/include/X11 Contains include files needed for
compiling programs using the X11 window system. Often, there
is a symbolic link from /usr/include/X11 to this
directory.</p>

<p>/usr/bin This is the primary directory for executable
programs. Most programs executed by normal users which are
not needed for boot- ing or for repairing the system and
which are not installed locally should be placed in this
directory.</p>

<p>/usr/bin/X11 is the traditional place to look for X11
executables; on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to
/usr/X11R6/bin.</p>

<p>/usr/dict Replaced by /usr/share/dict.</p>

<p>/usr/doc Replaced by /usr/share/doc.</p>

<p>/usr/etc Site-wide configuration files to be shared
between several machines may be stored in this directory.
However, commands should always reference those files using
the /etc directory. Links from files in /etc should point to
the appropriate files in /usr/etc.</p>

<p>/usr/games Binaries for games and educational programs
(optional).</p>

<p>/usr/include Include files for the C compiler.</p>

<p>/usr/include/X11 Include files for the C compiler and
the X-Window system. This is usually a symbolic link to
/usr/X11R6/include/X11.</p>

<p>/usr/include/asm Include files which declare some
assembler functions. This used to be a symbolic link to
/usr/src/linux/include/asm.</p>

<p>/usr/include/linux This contains information which may
change from system release to system release and used to be
a symbolic link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux to get at
operating system specific information.</p>

<p>(Note that one should have include files there that work
cor- rectly with the current libc and in user space.
However, Linux kernel source is not designed to be used with
user programs and does not know anything about the libc you
are using. It is very likely that things will break if you
let /usr/include/asm and /usr/include/linux point at a
random kernel tree. Debian sys- tems dont do this and use
headers from a known good kernel ver- sion, provided in the
libc*-dev package.)</p>

<p>/usr/include/g++ Include files to use with the GNU C++
compiler.</p>

<p>/usr/lib Object libraries, including dynamic libraries,
plus some exe- cutables which usually are not invoked
directly. More compli- cated programs may have whole
subdirectories there.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/X11 The usual place for data files associated
with X programs, and configuration files for the X system
itself. On Linux, it usu- ally is a symbolic link to
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/gcc-lib contains executables and include files
for the GNU C compiler, gcc(1).</p>

<p>/usr/lib/groff Files for the GNU groff document
formatting system.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/uucp Files for uucp(1).</p>

<p>/usr/local This is where programs which are local to the
site typically go.</p>

<p>/usr/local/bin Binaries for programs local to the
site.</p>

<p>/usr/local/doc Local documentation.</p>

<p>/usr/local/etc Configuration files associated with
locally installed programs.</p>

<p>/usr/local/games Binaries for locally installed
games.</p>

<p>/usr/local/lib Files associated with locally installed
programs.</p>

<p>/usr/local/include Header files for the local C
compiler.</p>

<p>/usr/local/info Info pages associated with locally
installed programs.</p>

<p>/usr/local/man Man pages associated with locally
installed programs.</p>

<p>/usr/local/sbin Locally installed programs for system
administration.</p>

<p>/usr/local/share Local application data that can be
shared among different archi- tectures of the same OS.</p>

<p>/usr/local/src Source code for locally installed
software.</p>

<p>/usr/man Replaced by /usr/share/man.</p>

<p>/usr/sbin This directory contains program binaries for
system administra- tion which are not essential for the boot
process, for mounting /usr, or for system repair.</p>

<p>/usr/share This directory contains subdirectories with
specific application data, that can be shared among
different architectures of the same OS. Often one finds
stuff here that used to live in /usr/doc or /usr/lib or
/usr/man.</p>

<p>/usr/share/dict Contains the word lists used by spell
checkers.</p>

<p>/usr/share/doc Documentation about installed
programs.</p>

<p>/usr/share/games Static data files for games in
/usr/games.</p>

<p>/usr/share/info Info pages go here.</p>

<p>/usr/share/locale Locale information goes here.</p>

<p>/usr/share/man Manual pages go here in subdirectories
according to the man page sections.</p>

<p>/usr/share/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man[1-9] These directories
contain manual pages for the specific locale in source code
form. Systems which use a unique language and code set for
all manual pages may omit the &lt;locale&gt; substring.</p>

<p>/usr/share/misc Miscellaneous data that can be shared
among different architec- tures of the same OS.</p>

<p>/usr/share/nls The message catalogs for native language
support go here.</p>

<p>/usr/share/sgml Files for SGML and XML.</p>

<p>/usr/share/terminfo The database for terminfo.</p>

<p>/usr/share/tmac Troff macros that are not distributed
with groff.</p>

<p>/usr/share/zoneinfo Files for timezone information.</p>

<p>/usr/src Source files for different parts of the system,
included with some packages for reference purposes. Dont
work here with your own projects, as files below /usr should
be read-only except when installing software.</p>

<p>/usr/src/linux This was the traditional place for the
kernel source. Some dis- tributions put here the source for
the default kernel they ship. You should probably use
another directory when building your own kernel.</p>

<p>/usr/tmp Obsolete. This should be a link to /var/tmp.
This link is present only for compatibility reasons and
shouldnt be used.</p>

<p>/var This directory contains files which may change in
size, such as spool and log files.</p>

<p>/var/adm This directory is superseded by /var/log and
should be a sym- bolic link to /var/log.</p>

<p>/var/backups Reserved for historical reasons.</p>

<p>/var/cache Data cached for programs.</p>

<p>/var/catman/cat[1-9] or /var/cache/man/cat[1-9] These
directories contain preformatted manual pages according to
their man page section. (The use of preformatted manual
pages is deprecated.)</p>

<p>/var/cron Reserved for historical reasons.</p>

<p>/var/lib Variable state information for programs.</p>

<p>/var/local Variable data for /usr/local.</p>

<p>/var/lock Lock files are placed in this directory. The
naming convention for device lock files is
LCK..&lt;device&gt; where &lt;device&gt; is the devices name
in the file system. The format used is that of HDU UUCP lock
files, that is, lock files contain a PID as a 10-byte ASCII
decimal number, followed by a newline character.</p>

<p>/var/log Miscellaneous log files.</p>

<p>/var/opt Variable data for /opt.</p>

<p>/var/mail Users mailboxes. Replaces /var/spool/mail.</p>

<p>/var/msgs Reserved for historical reasons.</p>

<p>/var/preserve Reserved for historical reasons.</p>

<p>/var/run Run-time variable files, like files holding
process identifiers (PIDs) and logged user information
(utmp). Files in this direc- tory are usually cleared when
the system boots.</p>

<p>/var/spool Spooled (or queued) files for various
programs.</p>

<p>/var/spool/at Spooled jobs for at(1).</p>

<p>/var/spool/cron Spooled jobs for cron(8).</p>

<p>/var/spool/lpd Spooled files for printing.</p>

<p>/var/spool/mail Replaced by /var/mail.</p>

<p>/var/spool/mqueue Queued outgoing mail.</p>

<p>/var/spool/news Spool directory for news.</p>

<p>/var/spool/rwho Spooled files for rwhod(8).</p>

<p>/var/spool/smail Spooled files for the smail(1) mail
delivery program.</p>

<p>/var/spool/uucp Spooled files for uucp(1).</p>

<p>/var/tmp Like /tmp, this directory holds temporary files
stored for an unspecified duration.</p>

<p>/var/yp Database files for NIS.</p>
