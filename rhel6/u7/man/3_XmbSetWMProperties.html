<p>XSetWMProperties(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XSetWMProperties(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetWMProperties, XmbSetWMProperties,
Xutf8SetWMProperties - set stan- dard window properties</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XSetWMProperties(Display *display, Window w,
XTextProperty *win- dow_name, XTextProperty *icon_name, char
**argv, int argc, XSizeHints *normal_hints, XWMHints
*wm_hints, XClassHint *class_hints);</p>

<p>void XmbSetWMProperties(Display *display, Window w, char
*window_name, char *icon_name, char *argv[], int argc,
XSizeHints *nor- mal_hints, XWMHints *wm_hints, XClassHint
*class_hints);</p>

<p>void Xutf8SetWMProperties(Display *display, Window w,
char *win- dow_name, char *icon_name, char *argv[], int
argc, XSizeHints *normal_hints, XWMHints *wm_hints,
XClassHint *class_hints);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS argc Specifies the number of arguments.</p>

<p>argv Specifies the applications argument list.</p>

<p>class_hints Specifies the XClassHint structure to be
used.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>icon_name Specifies the icon name, which should be a
null-terminated string.</p>

<p>normal_hints Specifies the size hints for the window in
its normal state.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>window_name Specifies the window name, which should be a
null-terminated string.</p>

<p>wm_hints Specifies the XWMHints structure to be
used.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetWMProperties convenience function
provides a single programming interface for setting those
essential window properties that are used for communicating
with other clients (particularly window and session
managers).</p>

<p>If the window_name argument is non-NULL,
XSetWMProperties calls XSetWM- Name, which in turn, sets the
WM_NAME property (see section 14.1.4). If the icon_name
argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls XSetWMI-
conName, which sets the WM_ICON_NAME property (see section
14.1.5). If the argv argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties
calls XSetCommand, which sets the WM_COMMAND property (see
section 14.2.1). Note that an argc of zero is allowed to
indicate a zero-length command. Note also that the hostname
of this machine is stored using XSetWMClientMachine (see
section 14.2.2).</p>

<p>If the normal_hints argument is non-NULL,
XSetWMProperties calls XSetWMNormalHints, which sets the
WM_NORMAL_HINTS property (see section 14.1.7). If the
wm_hints argument is non-NULL, XSetWMProperties calls
XSetWMHints, which sets the WM_HINTS property (see section
14.1.6).</p>

<p>If the class_hints argument is non-NULL,
XSetWMProperties calls XSet- ClassHint, which sets the
WM_CLASS property (see section 14.1.8). If the res_name
member in the XClassHint structure is set to the NULL
pointer and the RESOURCE_NAME environment variable is set,
then the value of the environment variable is substituted
for res_name. If the res_name member is NULL, the
environment variable is not set, and argv and argv[0] are
set, then the value of argv[0], stripped of any direc- tory
prefixes, is substituted for res_name.</p>

<p>The XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties
convenience functions provide a simple programming interface
for setting those essential win- dow properties that are
used for communicating with other clients (par- ticularly
window and session managers).</p>

<p>If the window_name argument is non-NULL, they set the
WM_NAME property. If the icon_name argument is non-NULL,
they set the WM_ICON_NAME prop- erty. The window_name and
icon_name arguments are null-terminated strings, for
XmbSetWMProperties in the encoding of the current locale,
for Xutf8SetWMProperties in UTF-8 encoding. If the arguments
can be fully converted to the STRING encoding, the
properties are created with type STRING; otherwise, the
arguments are converted to Compound Text, and the properties
are created with type COMPOUND_TEXT.</p>

<p>If the normal_hints argument is non-NULL,
XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties call
XSetWMNormalHints, which sets the WM_NOR- MAL_HINTS property
(see section 14.1.7). If the wm_hints argument is non-NULL,
XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties call
XSetWMHints, which sets the WM_HINTS property (see section
14.1.6).</p>

<p>If the argv argument is non-NULL, XmbSetWMProperties and
Xutf8SetWM- Properties set the WM_COMMAND property from argv
and argc. An argc of zero indicates a zero-length
command.</p>

<p>The hostname of the machine is stored using
XSetWMClientMachine (see section 14.2.2).</p>

<p>If the class_hints argument is non-NULL,
XmbSetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties set the WM_CLASS
property. If the res_name member in the XClassHint structure
is set to the NULL pointer and the RESOURCE_NAME environment
variable is set, the value of the environment variable is
substituted for res_name. If the res_name member is NULL,
the environment variable is not set, and argv and argv[0]
are set, then the value of argv[0], stripped of any
directory prefixes, is substi- tuted for res_name.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the supplied class_hints.res_name and
argv, the RESOURCE_NAME environment variable, and the
hostname of the machine are in the encoding of the current
locale. The corresponding WM_CLASS, WM_COMMAND, and
WM_CLIENT_MACHINE properties are typed according to the
local host locale announcer. No encoding conversion is
performed for these strings prior to storage in the
properties.</p>

<p>For clients that need to process the property text in a
locale, Xmb- SetWMProperties and Xutf8SetWMProperties set
the WM_LOCALE_NAME prop- erty to be the name of the current
locale. The name is assumed to be in the Host Portable
Character Encoding and is converted to STRING for storage in
the property.</p>

<p>XSetWMProperties, XmbSetWMProperties and
Xutf8SetWMProperties can gen- erate BadAlloc and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The function Xutf8SetWMProperties is an extension
introduced by The XFree86 Project, Inc. in their 4.0.2
release. Its presence is indicated by the macro
X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES WM_CLASS Set by application programs to allow
window and session man- agers to obtain the applications
resources from the resource database.</p>

<p>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE The string name of the machine on
which the client applica- tion is running.</p>

<p>WM_COMMAND The command and arguments, null-separated,
used to invoke the application.</p>

<p>WM_HINTS Additional hints set by the client for use by
the window man- ager. The C type of this property is
XWMHints.</p>

<p>WM_ICON_NAME The name to be used in an icon.</p>

<p>WM_NAME The name of the application.</p>

<p>WM_NORMAL_HINTS Size hints for a window in its normal
state. The C type of this property is XSizeHints.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
