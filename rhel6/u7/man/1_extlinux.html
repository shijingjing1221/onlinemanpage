<p>NAME extlinux - install the SYSLINUX bootloader on a
ext2/ext3 filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS extlinux [options] directory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION EXTLINUX is a new syslinux derivative, which
boots from a Linux ext2/ext3 filesystem. It works the same
way as SYSLINUX, with a few slight modifications. It is
intended to simplify first-time installa- tion of Linux, and
for creation of rescue and other special-purpose boot
disks.</p>

<p>The installer is designed to be run on a mounted
directory. For exam- ple, if you have an ext2 or ext3 usb
key mounted on /mnt, you can run the following command:</p>

<p>extlinux --install /mnt</p>

<p>OPTIONS -H, --heads=# Force the number of heads.</p>

<p>-i, --install Install over the current bootsector.</p>

<p>-O, --clear-once Clear the boot-once command.</p>

<p>-o, --once=command Execute a command once upon boot.</p>

<p>-M, --menu-save=label Set the label to select as default
on the next boot</p>

<p>-r, --raid Fall back to the next device on boot
failure.</p>

<p>--reset-adv Reset auxiliary data.</p>

<p>-S, --sectors=# Force the number of sectors per
track.</p>

<p>-U, --update Updates a previous EXTLINUX
installation.</p>

<p>-z, --zip Force zipdrive geometry (-H 64 -S 32).</p>

<p>FILES The extlinux configuration file needs to be named
extlinux.conf and needs to be stored in the extlinux
installation directory. For more information about the
contents of extlinux.conf, see syslinux(1) man- page,
section files.</p>

<p>BUGS I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have
with SYSLINUX. I would also like to hear from you if you
have successfully used SYS- LINUX, especially if you are
using it for a distribution.</p>

<p>If you are reporting problems, please include all
possible information about your system and your BIOS; the
vast majority of all problems reported turn out to be BIOS
or hardware bugs, and I need as much information as possible
in order to diagnose the problems.</p>

<p>There is a mailing list for discussion among SYSLINUX
users and for announcements of new and test versions. To
join, send a message to majordomo@linux.kernel.org with the
line:</p>
