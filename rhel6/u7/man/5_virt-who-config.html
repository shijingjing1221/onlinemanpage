<p>VIRT-WHO-CONFIG(5) VIRT-WHO-CONFIG(5)</p>

<p>NAME virt-who-config - configuration for virt-who</p>

<p>SYNOPISIS /etc/virt-who.d/*</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Configuration format is ini-like, where

provides virtual- ization information (not applicable for
vdsm mode).</p>

<p>username Username for authentication to the server (not
applicable for vdsm mode).</p>

<p>password Password for authentication to the server (not
applicable for vdsm mode).</p>

<p>encrypted_password Alternative to the password option,
encrypted password that is generated by virt-who-password(8)
utility.</p>

<p>owner Owner for use with Subscription Asset Manager, the
Red Hat Cus- tomer Portal, or Satellite 6 (not applicable
for Satellite 5)</p>

<p>env Environment for use with Subscription Asset Manager
or Satellite 6 (not applicable for Satellite 5)</p>

<p>rhsm_username Optional username to use to communicate
with Subscription Asset Manager or Satellite 6 instead of
the registered systems iden- tity certificate. (not
applicable for Satellite 5)</p>

<p>rhsm_password Optional password to use to communicate
with Subscription Asset Manager or Satellite 6 instead of
the registered systems iden- tity certificate. (not
applicable for Satellite 5)</p>

<p>rhsm_encrypted_password Alternative to the rhsm_password
option, encrypted password that is generated by
virt-who-password(8) utility.</p>

<p>filter_host_uuids Only hosts which uuid is specified in
comma-separated list in this option will be reported. Put
the uuid into the double- quotes if it contains special
characters (like comma).</p>

<p>exclude_host_uuids Hosts which uuid is specified in
comma-separated list in this option will NOT be reported.
Put the uuid into the double-quotes if it contains special
characters (like comma).</p>

<p>hypervisor_id Property that should be used as
identification of the hypervi- sor. Can be one of following:
uuid, hostname, hwuuid. Note that some virtualization
backends dont have all of them implemented. Default is uuid.
Applicable to esx, hyperv and rhevm only. This property is
meant to be set up before initial run of virt-who. Changing
it later will result in duplicated entries in the sub-
scription manager.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE [test-esx] type=esx server=1.2.3.4
username=admin password=password owner=test env=staging
rhsm_username=admin rhsm_password=password</p>

<p>BACKEND SPECIFIC OPTIONS ESX BACKEND filter_host_parents
Only hosts which parent (usually ComputeResource) name is
speci- fied in comma-separated list in this option will be
reported. Put the name into the double-quotes if it contains
special char- acters (like comma).</p>

<p>exclude_host_parents Hosts which parent (usually
ComputeResource) name is specified in comma-separated list
in this option will NOT be reported. Put the name into the
double-quotes if it contains special charac- ters (like
comma).</p>

<p>simplified_vim virt-who by default uses stripped-down
version of vimSer- vice.wsdl file that contains vSphere SOAP
API definition. Set this option to false to use server
provided wsdl file that will be retrieved automatically.</p>

<p>FAKE BACKEND Fake backend reads host/guests associations
from the file on disk, for example:</p>

<p>[fake-virt] type=fake file=/path/to/json
is_hypervisor=True</p>

<p>type Must be always fake.</p>

<p>is_hypervisor If true (default), the option determines
that the fake data are fetched from multihost
environment.</p>

<p>file Absolete path to the JSON file that has the same
structure as file returned from virt-who --print command,
for example: { &quot;hypervisors&quot;: [ {
&quot;uuid&quot;:
&quot;7e98b6ea-0af1-4afa-b846-919549bb0fe2&quot;,
&quot;guests&quot;: [ { &quot;guestId&quot;:
&quot;8ae19f08-2605-b476-d42e-4bd5a39f466c&quot; }, ... ] },
... ] }</p>
