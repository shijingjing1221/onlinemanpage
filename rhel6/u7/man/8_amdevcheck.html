<p>AMDEVCHECK(8) System Administration Commands
AMDEVCHECK(8)</p>

<p>NAME amdevcheck - Validate an Amanda device and
volume.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amdevcheck config [device name] [-o
configoption]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Amdevcheck provides a way to check that a
particular Amanda device is accessible, whether or not it
contains a volume, and whether or not that volume is
labeled. Some devices can&acute;t distinguish between all of
these cases; a missing volume and an unlabeled volume might
generate the same error code, for example. In those cases,
this tool reports all possible causes of the error.</p>

<p>See the amanda(8) man page for more details about
Amanda. See amanda- devices(7) for more information on
devices.</p>

<p>OPTIONS config</p>

<p>Amanda configuration to use. Note that amdevcheck
ignores any tape changer configuration.</p>

<p>device</p>

<p>Amanda device to use. This option overrides any tapedev
configuration specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p>-o clientconfigoption See the &quot;CONFIGURATION
OVERRIDE&quot; section in amanda(8).</p>

<p>OUTPUT Amdevcheck returns one or more of the following
lines. If multiple lines appear, then at least one, but not
necessarily all of the messages apply. This situation can
occur when working with hardware or operating systems which
cannot distinguish, for example, between a malfunctioning
drive and a functional but unloaded drive.</p>

<p>SUCCESS A tape is ready.</p>

<p>DEVICE_ERROR A device error has occurred.</p>

<p>DEVICE_BUSY The device is busy.</p>

<p>VOLUME_MISSING No tape is loaded in the drive.</p>

<p>VOLUME_UNLABELED The tape in the drive is unlabeled.</p>

<p>VOLUME_ERROR A volume error has occurred.</p>

<p>MESSAGE text Where text provides a human-readable
description of the problem.</p>
