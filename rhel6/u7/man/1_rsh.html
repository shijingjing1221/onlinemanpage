<p>RSH(1) BSD General Commands Manual RSH(1)</p>

<p>NAME rsh - remote shell</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rsh [-Kdnx] [-l username] host [command]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rsh executes command on host.</p>

<p>Rsh copies its standard input to the remote command, the
standard output of the remote command to its standard
output, and the standard error of the remote command to its
standard error. Interrupt, quit and terminate signals are
propagated to the remote command; rsh normally terminates
when the remote command does. The options are as
follows:</p>

<p>-d The -d option turns on socket debugging (using
setsockopt(2)) on the TCP sockets used for communication
with the remote host.</p>

<p>-l By default, the remote username is the same as the
local username. The -l option allows the remote name to be
specified.</p>

<p>-n The -n option redirects input from the special device
/dev/null (see the BUGS section of this manual page).</p>

<p>If no command is specified, you will be logged in on the
remote host using rlogin(1).</p>

<p>Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are
interpreted on local machine, while quoted metacharacters
are interpreted on the remote machine. For example, the
command</p>

<p>rsh otherhost cat remotefile &gt;&gt; localfile</p>

<p>appends the remote file remotefile to the local file
localfile, while</p>

<p>rsh otherhost cat remotefile &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;
other_remotefile</p>

<p>appends remotefile to other_remotefile.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/hosts</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rlogin(1),</p>

<p>HISTORY The rsh command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS If you are using csh(1) and put a rsh in the
background without redirect- ing its input away from the
terminal, it will block even if no reads are posted by the
remote command. If no input is desired you should redirect
the input of rsh to /dev/null using the -n option.</p>

<p>You cannot run an interactive command (like rogue(6) or
vi(1)) using rsh; use rlogin(1) instead.</p>

<p>Stop signals stop the local rsh process only; this is
arguably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons too
complicated to explain here.</p>
