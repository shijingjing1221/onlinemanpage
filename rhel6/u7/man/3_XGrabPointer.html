<p>XGrabPointer(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XGrabPointer(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGrabPointer, XUngrabPointer,
XChangeActivePointerGrab - grab the pointer</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XGrabPointer(Display *display, Window
grab_window, Bool owner_events, unsigned int event_mask, int
pointer_mode, int keyboard_mode, Window confine_to, Cursor
cursor, Time time);</p>

<p>int XUngrabPointer(Display *display, Time time);</p>

<p>int XChangeActivePointerGrab(Display *display, unsigned
int event_mask, Cursor cursor, Time time);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS confine_to Specifies the window to confine the
pointer in or None.</p>

<p>cursor Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed
during the grab or None.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>event_mask Specifies which pointer events are reported
to the client. The mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the
valid pointer event mask bits.</p>

<p>grab_window Specifies the grab window.</p>

<p>keyboard_mode Specifies further processing of keyboard
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>owner_events Specifies a Boolean value that indicates
whether the pointer events are to be reported as usual or
reported with respect to the grab window if selected by the
event mask.</p>

<p>pointer_mode Specifies further processing of pointer
events. You can pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp
or Cur- rentTime.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XGrabPointer function actively grabs
control of the pointer and returns GrabSuccess if the grab
was successful. Further pointer events are reported only to
the grabbing client. XGrabPointer overrides any active
pointer grab by this client. If owner_events is False, all
gen- erated pointer events are reported with respect to
grab_window and are reported only if selected by event_mask.
If owner_events is True and if a generated pointer event
would normally be reported to this client, it is reported as
usual. Otherwise, the event is reported with respect to the
grab_window and is reported only if selected by event_mask.
For either value of owner_events, unreported events are
discarded.</p>

<p>If the pointer_mode is GrabModeAsync, pointer event
processing contin- ues as usual. If the pointer is currently
frozen by this client, the processing of events for the
pointer is resumed. If the pointer_mode is GrabModeSync, the
state of the pointer, as seen by client applica- tions,
appears to freeze, and the X server generates no further
pointer events until the grabbing client calls XAllowEvents
or until the pointer grab is released. Actual pointer
changes are not lost while the pointer is frozen; they are
simply queued in the server for later processing.</p>

<p>If the keyboard_mode is GrabModeAsync, keyboard event
processing is unaffected by activation of the grab. If the
keyboard_mode is GrabMod- eSync, the state of the keyboard,
as seen by client applications, appears to freeze, and the X
server generates no further keyboard events until the
grabbing client calls XAllowEvents or until the pointer grab
is released. Actual keyboard changes are not lost while the
pointer is frozen; they are simply queued in the server for
later processing.</p>

<p>If a cursor is specified, it is displayed regardless of
what window the pointer is in. If None is specified, the
normal cursor for that window is displayed when the pointer
is in grab_window or one of its subwin- dows; otherwise, the
cursor for grab_window is displayed.</p>

<p>If a confine_to window is specified, the pointer is
restricted to stay contained in that window. The confine_to
window need have no relation- ship to the grab_window. If
the pointer is not initially in the con- fine_to window, it
is warped automatically to the closest edge just before the
grab activates and enter/leave events are generated as
usual. If the confine_to window is subsequently
reconfigured, the pointer is warped automatically, as
necessary, to keep it contained in the window.</p>

<p>The time argument allows you to avoid certain
circumstances that come up if applications take a long time
to respond or if there are long network delays. Consider a
situation where you have two applications, both of which
normally grab the pointer when clicked on. If both
applications specify the timestamp from the event, the
second applica- tion may wake up faster and successfully
grab the pointer before the first application. The first
application then will get an indication that the other
application grabbed the pointer before its request was
processed.</p>

<p>XGrabPointer generates EnterNotify and LeaveNotify
events.</p>

<p>Either if grab_window or confine_to window is not
viewable or if the confine_to window lies completely outside
the boundaries of the root window, XGrabPointer fails and
returns GrabNotViewable. If the pointer is actively grabbed
by some other client, it fails and returns Already- Grabbed.
If the pointer is frozen by an active grab of another
client, it fails and returns GrabFrozen. If the specified
time is earlier than the last-pointer-grab time or later
than the current X server time, it fails and returns
GrabInvalidTime. Otherwise, the last-pointer-grab time is
set to the specified time (CurrentTime is replaced by the
cur- rent X server time).</p>

<p>XGrabPointer can generate BadCursor, BadValue, and
BadWindow errors.</p>

<p>The XUngrabPointer function releases the pointer and any
queued events if this client has actively grabbed the
pointer from XGrabPointer, XGrabButton, or from a normal
button press. XUngrabPointer does not release the pointer if
the specified time is earlier than the last- pointer-grab
time or is later than the current X server time. It also
generates EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events. The X server
performs an UngrabPointer request automatically if the event
window or confine_to window for an active pointer grab
becomes not viewable or if window reconfiguration causes the
confine_to window to lie completely outside the boundaries
of the root window.</p>

<p>The XChangeActivePointerGrab function changes the
specified dynamic parameters if the pointer is actively
grabbed by the client and if the specified time is no
earlier than the last-pointer-grab time and no later than
the current X server time. This function has no effect on
the passive parameters of a XGrabButton. The interpretation
of event_mask and cursor is the same as described in
XGrabPointer.</p>

<p>XChangeActivePointerGrab can generate a BadCursor and
BadValue error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadCursor A value for a Cursor argument does
not name a defined Cursor.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
