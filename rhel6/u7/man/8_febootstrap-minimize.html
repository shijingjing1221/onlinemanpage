<p>FEBOOTSTRAP-MINIMIZE(8) Virtualization Support
FEBOOTSTRAP-MINIMIZE(8)</p>

<p>NAME febootstrap-minimize - Minimize an febootstrap
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS febootstrap-minimize [--options] DIR</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION febootstrap-minimize minimizes an
febootstrap(8)-created filesystem. This means that unneeded
files and cruft are removed from the image.</p>

<p>If no options are given, the default is to minimize the
image as much as possible. This means, for example, that
locales are removed so the image will only be usable in
US-English, there will be no documentation or manual pages,
and the image will only work in a UTC timezone.</p>

<p>Note that image minimization involves deleting files
that have been installed by RPM. Thus after minimization, it
is no longer guaranteed that RPM will function correctly on
the image. You should only do this as a final step for
&quot;throwaway&quot; appliances that do not need to be
modified or upgraded in future.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all Perform all minimization operations, to
produce the smallest possible image. Note in particular that
locales are discarded.</p>

<p>You can perform all minimization operations except X, Y
and Z by doing:</p>

<p>febootstrap-minimize --all --keep-X --keep-Y --keep-Z
...</p>

<p>(&quot;--all&quot; can be omitted since it is the
default).</p>

<p>--none Start with no minimization operations. You can
specify only minimization operations X, Y and Z like
this:</p>

<p>febootstrap-minimize --none --drop-X --drop-Y --drop-Z
...</p>

<p>--keep-locales --drop-locales Keep or drop locale
support.</p>

<p>--keep-docs --drop-docs Keep or drop documentation, man
pages and info files.</p>

<p>--keep-cracklib --drop-cracklib Keep or drop cracklib
libraries.</p>

<p>--keep-i18n --drop-i18n Keep or drop
&quot;/usr/share/i18n&quot;.</p>

<p>--keep-zoneinfo --drop-zoneinfo Keep or drop all
timezones (except UTC which is never deleted).</p>

<p>--keep-rpmdb --drop-rpmdb Keep or drop the RPM and YUM
package databases. Obviously RPM and YUM will be completely
non-functional if you drop these.</p>

<p>--keep-yum-cache --drop-yum-cache Keep or drop the yum
cache. Note that febootstrap(8) has already deleted this
directory unless you ran it with the &quot;--no-clean&quot;
option.</p>

<p>--keep-services --drop-services Keep or drop the
&quot;/etc/services&quot; file. If dropped, this file is
replaced with a very minimal one which just lists the most
common services. For less common services you will have to
refer to them by port number instead of name.</p>

<p>--keep-sln --drop-sln Keep or drop &quot;/sbin/sln&quot;
(statically linked &quot;ln&quot;). This is not really
required in minimal appliances.</p>

<p>--keep-ldconfig --drop-ldconfig Keep or drop
&quot;/sbin/ldconfig&quot;, &quot;/etc/ld.so.cache&quot; and
&quot;/var/cache/ldconfig&quot; (the dynamic linking cache).
This is not needed. Dynamic linking during program execution
will be marginally slower.</p>

<p>--pack-executables This option has been removed in
febootstrap 2.5. In previous versions it was used to pack
executables using the external &quot;upx&quot; program.
However it was not enabled by default and never worked very
effectively.</p>

<p>TODO &middot; Deduplicate files with the same content
(by hardlinking them). See the program hardlink(1).</p>

<p>&middot; Remove unused binaries.</p>

<p>&middot; Remove unused libraries.</p>
