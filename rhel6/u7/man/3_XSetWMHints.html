<p>XAllocWMHints(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XAllocWMHints(3)</p>

<p>NAME XAllocWMHints, XSetWMHints, XGetWMHints, XWMHints -
allocate window manager hints structure and set or read a
windows WM_HINTS property</p>

<p>SYNTAX XWMHints *XAllocWMHints(void);</p>

<p>int XSetWMHints(Display *display, Window w, XWMHints
*wmhints);</p>

<p>XWMHints *XGetWMHints(Display *display, Window w);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS display Specifies the connection to the X
server.</p>

<p>w Specifies the window.</p>

<p>wmhints Specifies the XWMHints structure to be used.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XAllocWMHints function allocates and
returns a pointer to a XWMHints structure. Note that all
fields in the XWMHints structure are initially set to zero.
If insufficient memory is available, XAl- locWMHints returns
NULL. To free the memory allocated to this struc- ture, use
XFree.</p>

<p>The XSetWMHints function sets the window manager hints
that include icon information and location, the initial
state of the window, and whether the application relies on
the window manager to get keyboard input.</p>

<p>XSetWMHints can generate BadAlloc and BadWindow
errors.</p>

<p>The XGetWMHints function reads the window manager hints
and returns NULL if no WM_HINTS property was set on the
window or returns a pointer to a XWMHints structure if it
succeeds. When finished with the data, free the space used
for it by calling XFree.</p>

<p>XGetWMHints can generate a BadWindow error.</p>

<p>PROPERTIES WM_HINTS Additional hints set by the client
for use by the window man- ager. The C type of this property
is XWMHints.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES The XWMHints structure contains:</p>

<p>/* Window manager hints mask bits */</p>

<p>#define InputHint (1L &lt;&lt; 0) #define StateHint (1L
&lt;&lt; 1) #define IconPixmapHint (1L &lt;&lt; 2) #define
IconWindowHint (1L &lt;&lt; 3) #define IconPositionHint (1L
&lt;&lt; 4) #define IconMaskHint (1L &lt;&lt; 5) #define
WindowGroupHint (1L &lt;&lt; 6) #define XUrgencyHint (1L
&lt;&lt; 8)</p>

<p>#define AllHints (InputHint|State- Hint|IconPixmapHint|
IconWindowHint|IconPosi- tionHint| IconMaskHint|Window-
GroupHint) /* Values */</p>

<p>typedef struct { long flags; /* marks which fields in
this structure are defined */ Bool input; /* does this
application rely on the window manager to get keyboard
input? */ int initial_state; /* see below */ Pixmap
icon_pixmap; /* pixmap to be used as icon */ Window
icon_window; /* window to be used as icon */ int icon_x,
icon_y; /* initial position of icon */ Pixmap icon_mask; /*
pixmap to be used as mask for icon_pixmap */ XID
window_group; /* id of related window group */ /* this
structure may be extended in the future */ } XWMHints;</p>

<p>The input member is used to communicate to the window
manager the input focus model used by the application.
Applications that expect input but never explicitly set
focus to any of their subwindows (that is, use the push
model of focus management), such as X Version 10 style
appli- cations that use real-estate driven focus, should set
this member to True. Similarly, applications that set input
focus to their subwindows only when it is given to their
top-level window by a window manager should also set this
member to True. Applications that manage their own input
focus by explicitly setting focus to one of their subwindows
whenever they want keyboard input (that is, use the pull
model of focus management) should set this member to False.
Applications that never expect any keyboard input also
should set this member to False.</p>

<p>Pull model window managers should make it possible for
push model applications to get input by setting input focus
to the top-level win- dows of applications whose input
member is True. Push model window managers should make sure
that pull model applications do not break them by resetting
input focus to PointerRoot when it is appropriate (for
example, whenever an application whose input member is False
sets input focus to one of its subwindows).</p>

<p>The definitions for the initial_state flag are:</p>

<p>#define WithdrawnState 0 #define NormalState 1 /* most
applications start this way */ #define IconicState 3 /*
application wants to start as an icon */ The icon_mask
specifies which pixels of the icon_pixmap should be used as
the icon. This allows for nonrectangular icons. Both
icon_pixmap and icon_mask must be bitmaps. The icon_window
lets an application provide a window for use as an icon for
window managers that support such use. The window_group lets
you specify that this window belongs to a group of other
windows. For example, if a single application manipulates
multiple top-level windows, this allows you to provide
enough information that a window manager can iconify all of
the windows rather than just the one window.</p>

<p>The UrgencyHint flag, if set in the flags field,
indicates that the client deems the window contents to be
urgent, requiring the timely response of the user. The
window manager will make some effort to draw the users
attention to this window while this flag is set. The client
must provide some means by which the user can cause the
urgency flag to be cleared (either mitigating the condition
that made the window urgent or merely shutting off the
alarm) or the window to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadWindow A value for a Window argument does not name a
defined Window.</p>
