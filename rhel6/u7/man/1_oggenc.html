<p>NAME oggenc - encode audio into the Ogg Vorbis
format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS oggenc [ -hrQ ] [ -B raw input sample size ] [
-C raw input number of channels ] [ -R raw input samplerate
] [ -b nominal bitrate ] [ -m min- imum bitrate ] [ -M
maximum bitrate ] [ -q quality ] [ --resample fre- quency ]
[ --downmix ] [ -s serial ] [ -o output_file ] [ -n pattern
] [ -c extra_comment ] [ -a artist ] [ -t title ] [ -l album
] [ -G genre ] input_files ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION oggenc reads audio data in either raw, WAV,
or AIFF format and encodes it into an Ogg Vorbis stream.
oggenc may also read audio data from FLAC and Ogg FLAC files
depending upon compile-time options. If the input file
&quot;-&quot; is specified, audio data is read from stdin
and the Vor- bis stream is written to stdout unless the -o
option is used to redi- rect the output. By default, disk
files are output to Ogg Vorbis files of the same name, with
the extension changed to &quot;.ogg&quot;. This naming
convention can be overridden by the -o option (in the case
of one file) or the -n option (in the case of several
files). Finally, if none of these are available, the output
filename will be the input filename with the extension (that
part after the final dot) replaced with ogg, so file.wav
will become file.ogg</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Show command help.</p>

<p>-v, --version Show the version number.</p>

<p>-r, --raw Assume input data is raw little-endian audio
data with no header information. If other options are not
specified, defaults to 44.1kHz stereo 16 bit. See next three
options for how to change this.</p>

<p>-B n, --raw-bits=n Sets raw mode input sample size in
bits. Default is 16.</p>

<p>-C n, --raw-chan=n Sets raw mode input number of
channels. Default is 2.</p>

<p>-R n, --raw-rate=n Sets raw mode input samplerate.
Default is 44100.</p>

<p>--raw-endianness n Sets raw mode endianness to big
endian (1) or little endian (0). Default is little
endian.</p>

<p>-Q, --quiet Quiet mode. No messages are displayed.</p>

<p>-b n, --bitrate=n Sets target bitrate to n (in kb/s).
The encoder will attempt to encode at approximately this
bitrate. By default, this remains a VBR encoding. See the
--managed option to force a managed bitrate encoding at the
selected bitrate.</p>

<p>-m n, --min-bitrate=n Sets minimum bitrate to n (in
kb/s). Enables bitrate management mode (see --managed).</p>

<p>-M n, --max-bitrate=n Sets maximum bitrate to n (in
kb/s). Enables bitrate management mode (see --managed).</p>

<p>--managed Set bitrate management mode. This turns off
the normal VBR encoding, but allows hard or soft bitrate
constraints to be enforced by the encoder. This mode is much
slower, and may also be lower quality. It is primarily
useful for creating files for streaming.</p>

<p>-q n, --quality=n Sets encoding quality to n, between -1
(very low) and 10 (very high). This is the default mode of
operation, with a default quality level of 3. Fractional
quality levels such as 2.5 are permitted. Using this option
allows the encoder to select an appropriate bitrate based on
your desired quality level.</p>

<p>--resample n Resample input to the given sample rate (in
Hz) before encoding. Primarily useful for downsampling for
lower-bitrate encoding.</p>

<p>--downmix Downmix input from stereo to mono (has no
effect on non-stereo streams). Useful for lower-bitrate
encoding.</p>

<p>--advanced-encode-option optionname=value Sets an
advanced option. See the Advanced Options section for
details.</p>

<p>-s, --serial Forces a specific serial number in the
output stream. This is primarily useful for testing.</p>

<p>--discard-comments Prevents comments in FLAC and Ogg
FLAC files from being copied to the output Ogg Vorbis
file.</p>

<p>-o output_file, --output=output_file Write the Ogg
Vorbis stream to output_file (only valid if a sin- gle input
file is specified).</p>

<p>-n pattern, --names=pattern Produce filenames as this
string, with %g, %a, %l, %n, %t, %d replaced by genre,
artist, album, track number, title, and date, respectively
(see below for specifying these). Also, %% gives a literal
%.</p>

<p>-X, --name-remove=s Remove the specified characters from
parameters to the -n format string. This is useful to ensure
legal filenames are generated.</p>

<p>-P, --name-replace=s Replace characters removed by
--name-remove with the characters specified. If this string
is shorter than the --name-remove list, or is not specified,
the extra characters are just removed. The default settings
for this option, and the -X option above, are platform
specific (and chosen to ensure legal file- names are
generated for each platform).</p>

<p>-c comment, --comment comment Add the string comment as
an extra comment. This may be used multiple times, and all
instances will be added to each of the input files
specified. The argument should be in the form
&quot;tag=value&quot;.</p>

<p>-a artist, --artist artist Set the artist comment field
in the comments to artist.</p>

<p>-G genre, --genre genre Set the genre comment field in
the comments to genre.</p>

<p>-d date, --date date Sets the date comment field to the
given value. This should be the date of recording.</p>

<p>-N n, --tracknum n Sets the track number comment field
to the given value.</p>

<p>-t title, --title title Set the track title comment
field to title.</p>

<p>-l album, --album album Set the album comment field to
album.</p>

<p>Note that the -a, -t, and -l options can be given
multiple times. They will be applied, one to each file, in
the order given. If there are fewer album, title, or artist
comments given than there are input files, oggenc will reuse
the final one for the remaining files, and issue a warning
in the case of repeated titles.</p>

<p>ADVANCED ENCODER OPTIONS Oggenc allows you to set a
number of advanced encoder options using the
--advanced-encode-option option. These are intended for very
advanced users only, and should be approached with caution.
They may signifi- cantly degrade audio quality if misused.
Not all these options are cur- rently documented.</p>

<p>lowpass_frequency=N Set the lowpass frequency to N
kHz.</p>

<p>impulse_noisetune=N Set a noise floor bias N (range from
-15. to 0.) for impulse blocks. A negative bias instructs
the encoder to pay special attention to the crispness of
transients in the encoded audio. The tradeoff for better
transient response is a higher bitrate.</p>

<p>bitrate_hard_max=N Set the allowed bitrate maximum for
the encoded file to N bits per second. This bitrate may be
exceeded only when there is spare bits in the bit reservoir;
if the bit reservoir is exhausted, frames will be held under
this value. This setting must be used with --managed to have
any effect.</p>

<p>bitrate_hard_min=N Set the allowed bitrate minimum for
the encoded file to N bits per second. This bitrate may be
underrun only when the bit reservoir is not full; if the bit
reservoir is full, frames will be held over this value; if
it impossible to add bits construc- tively, the frame will
be padded with zeroes. This setting must be used with
--managed to have any effect.</p>

<p>bit_reservoir_bits=N Set the total size of the bit
reservoir to N bits; the default size of the reservoir is
equal to the nominal number of bits coded in one second (eg,
a nominal 128kbps file will have a bit reservoir of 128000
bits by default). This option must be used with --managed to
have any effect and affects only minimum and maximum bitrate
management. Average bitrate encoding with no hard bitrate
boundaries does not use a bit reservoir.</p>

<p>bit_reservoir_bias=N Set the behavior bias of the bit
reservoir (range: 0. to 1.). When set closer to 0, the
bitrate manager attempts to hoard bits for future use in
sudden bitrate increases (biasing toward bet- ter transient
reproduction). When set closer to 1, the bitrate manager
neglects transients in favor using bits for homogenous
passages. In the middle, the manager uses a balanced
approach. The default setting is .2, thus biasing slightly
toward tran- sient reproduction.</p>

<p>bitrate_average=N Set the average bitrate for the file
to N bits per second. When used without hard minimum or
maximum limits, this option selects reservoirless Average
Bit Rate encoding, where the encoder attempts to perfectly
track a desired bitrate, but imposes no strict momentary
fluctuation limits. When used along with a minimum or
maximum limit, the average bitrate still sets the average
overall bitrate of the file, but will work within the bounds
set by the bit reservoir. When the min, max and average
bitrates are identical, oggenc produces Constant Bit Rate
Vorbis data.</p>

<p>bitrate_average_damping=N Set the reaction time for the
average bitrate tracker to N sec- onds. This number
represents the fastest reaction the bitrate tracker is
allowed to make to hold the bitrate to the selected average.
The faster the reaction time, the less momentary fluc-
tuation in the bitrate but (generally) the lower quality the
audio output. The slower the reaction time, the larger the
ABR fluctuations, but (generally) the better the audio. When
used along with min or max bitrate limits, this option
directly affects how deep and how quickly the encoder will
dip into its bit reservoir; the higher the number, the more
demand on the bit reservoir.</p>

<p>The setting must be greater than zero and the useful
range is approximately .05 to 10. The default is .75
seconds.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Simplest version. Produces output as
somefile.ogg: oggenc somefile.wav</p>

<p>Specifying an output filename: oggenc somefile.wav -o
out.ogg</p>

<p>Specifying a high-quality encoding averaging 256 kbps
(but still VBR). oggenc infile.wav -b 256 out.ogg</p>

<p>Specifying a maximum and average bitrate, and enforcing
these. oggenc infile.wav --managed -b 128 -M 160 out.ogg</p>

<p>Specifying quality rather than bitrate (to a very high
quality mode) oggenc infile.wav -q 6 out.ogg</p>

<p>Downsampling and downmixing to 11 kHz mono before
encoding. oggenc --resample 11025 --downmix infile.wav -q 1
out.ogg</p>

<p>Adding some info about the track: oggenc somefile.wav -t
&quot;The track title&quot; -a &quot;artist who per- formed
this&quot; -l &quot;name of album&quot; -c
&quot;OTHERFIELD=contents of some other field not explicitly
supported&quot;</p>

<p>This encodes the three files, each with the same
artist/album tag, but with different title tags on each one.
The string given as an argument to -n is used to generate
filenames, as shown in the section above. This example gives
filenames like &quot;The Tea Party - Touch.ogg&quot;: oggenc
-b 192 -a &quot;The Tea Party&quot; -l &quot;Triptych&quot;
-t &quot;Touch&quot; track01.wav -t &quot;Underground&quot;
track02.wav -t &quot;Great Big Lie&quot; track03.wav -n
&quot;%a - %t.ogg&quot;</p>

<p>Encoding from stdin, to stdout (you can also use the
various tagging options, like -t, -a, -l, etc.): oggenc

<p>BUGS Reading type 3 wav files (floating point samples)
probably doesnt work other than on intel (or other 32 bit,
little endian machines).</p>
