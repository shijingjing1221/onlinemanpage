<p>NAME nasm - the Netwide Assembler, a portable 80x86
assembler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nasm [ -@ response file ] [ -f format ] [ -o
outfile ] [ -l listfile ] [ options... ] filename nasm -h
nasm -v</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nasm command assembles the file filename
and directs output to the file outfile if specified. If
outfile is not specified, nasm will derive a default output
file name from the name of its input file, usu- ally by
appending .o or .obj , or by removing all extensions for a
raw binary file. Failing that, the output file name will be
nasm.out.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -@ filename Causes nasm to process options from
filename as if they were included on the command line.</p>

<p>-a Causes nasm to assemble the given input file without
first applying the macro preprocessor.</p>

<p>-D macro[=value] Pre-defines a single-line macro.</p>

<p>-d macro[=value] Same as the -D option.</p>

<p>-e Causes nasm to preprocess the given input file, and
write the output to stdout (or the specified output file
name), and not actually assemble anything.</p>

<p>-f format Specifies the output file format. To see a
list of valid output formats, use the -hf option.</p>

<p>-g Causes nasm to generate debug information in selected
format</p>

<p>-h Causes nasm to exit immediately, after giving a
summary of its invocation options.</p>

<p>-hf Same as -h , but also lists all valid output
formats.</p>

<p>-I directory Adds a directory to the search path for
include files. The directory specification must include the
trailing slash, as it will be directly prepended to the name
of the include file.</p>

<p>-i directory Same as the -I option.</p>

<p>-l listfile Causes an assembly listing to be directed to
the given file, in which the original source is displayed on
the right hand side (plus the source for included files and
the expansions of multi- line macros) and the generated code
is shown in hex on the left.</p>

<p>-M Causes nasm to output Makefile-style dependencies to
stdout; normal output is suppressed.</p>

<p>-O number optimize branch offsets (-O0 disables,
default).</p>

<p>-o outfile Specifies a precise name for the output file,
overriding nasms default means of determining it.</p>

<p>-P file Specifies a file to be pre-included, before the
main source file starts to be processed.</p>

<p>-p file Same as the -P option.</p>

<p>-r Causes nasm to exit immediately, after displaying its
version number. (obsolete)</p>

<p>-s Causes nasm to send its error messages and/or help
text to std- out instead of stderr.</p>

<p>-t Causes nasm to assemble in SciTech TASM compatible
mode</p>

<p>-U macro Undefines a single-line macro.</p>

<p>-u macro Same as the -U option.</p>

<p>-v Causes nasm to exit immediately, after displaying its
version number.</p>

<p>-w[+-]foo Causes nasm to enable or disable certain
classes of warning mes- sages, for example -w+orphan-labels
or -w-macro-params</p>

<p>-X format specifies error reporting format (gnu or
vc).</p>

<p>-Z filename Causes nasm to redirect error messages to
filename. This option exists to support operating systems on
which stderr is not eas- ily redirected.</p>

<p>SYNTAX This man page does not fully describe the syntax
of nasms assembly language, but does give a summary of the
differences from other assem- blers.</p>

<p>Registers have no leading % sign, unlike gas, and
floating-point stack registers are referred to as st0, st1,
and so on.</p>

<p>Floating-point instructions may use either the
single-operand form or the double. A TO keyword is provided;
thus, one could either write</p>

<p>fadd st0,st1 fadd st1,st0</p>

<p>or one could use the alternative single-operand
forms</p>

<p>fadd st1 fadd to st1</p>

<p>Uninitialised storage is reserved using the RESB, RESW,
RESD, RESQ, REST and RESO pseudo-opcodes, each taking one
parameter which gives the number of bytes, words,
doublewords, quadwords or ten-byte words to reserve.</p>

<p>Repetition of data items is not done by the DUP keyword
as seen in DOS assemblers, but by the use of the TIMES
prefix, like this:</p>

<p>message: times 3 db abc times 64-$+message db 0</p>

<p>which defines the string abcabcabc, followed by the
right number of zero bytes to make the total length up to 64
bytes.</p>

<p>Symbol references are always understood to be immediate
(i.e. the address of the symbol), unless square brackets are
used, in which case the contents of the memory location are
used. Thus:</p>

<p>mov ax,wordvar</p>

<p>loads AX with the address of the variable wordvar,
whereas</p>

<p>mov ax,[wordvar] mov ax,[wordvar+1] mov
ax,[es:wordvar+bx]</p>

<p>all refer to the contents of memory locations. The
syntaxes</p>

<p>mov ax,es:wordvar[bx] es mov ax,wordvar[1]</p>

<p>are not legal at all, although the use of a segment
register name as an instruction prefix is valid, and can be
used with instructions such as LODSB which cant be
overridden any other way.</p>

<p>Constants may be expressed numerically in most formats:
a trailing H, Q or B denotes hex, octal or binary
respectively, and a leading 0x or $ denotes hex as well.
Leading zeros are not treated specially at all. Character
constants may be enclosed in single or double quotes; there
is no escape character. The ordering is little-endian
(reversed), so that the character constant _ abcd_ denotes
0x64636261 and not 0x61626364.</p>

<p>Local labels begin with a period, and their locality is
granted by the assembler prepending the name of the previous
non-local symbol. Thus declaring a label .loop after a label
label has actually defined a symbol called label.loop.</p>

<p>DIRECTIVES SECTION name or SEGMENT name causes nasm to
direct all following code to the named section. Section
names vary with output file format, although most formats
support the names .text, .data and .bss. (The exception is
the obj format, in which all segments are
user-definable.)</p>

<p>ABSOLUTE address causes nasm to position its notional
assembly point at an absolute address: so no code or data
may be generated, but you can use RESB, RESW and RESD to
move the assembly point further on, and you can define
labels. So this directive may be used to define data struc-
tures. When you have finished doing absolute assembly, you
must issue another SECTION directive to return to normal
assembly.</p>

<p>BITS 16, BITS 32 or BITS 64 switches the default
processor mode for which nasm is generating code: it is
equivalent to USE16 or USE32 in DOS assemblers.</p>

<p>EXTERN symbol and GLOBAL symbol import and export symbol
definitions, respectively, from and to other modules. Note
that the GLOBAL directive must appear before the definition
of the symbol it refers to.</p>

<p>STRUC strucname and ENDSTRUC, when used to bracket a
number of RESB, RESW or similar instructions, define a data
structure. In addition to defining the offsets of the
structure members, the construct also defines a symbol for
the size of the structure, which is simply the structure
name with _size tacked on to the end.</p>

<p>FORMAT-SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES ORG address is used by the
bin flat-form binary output format, and specifies the
address at which the output code will eventually be
loaded.</p>

<p>GROUP grpname seg1 seg2... is used by the obj (Microsoft
16-bit) out- put format, and defines segment groups. This
format also uses UPPER- CASE, which directs that all
segment, group and symbol names output to the object file
should be in uppercase. Note that the actual assembly is
still case sensitive.</p>

<p>LIBRARY libname is used by the rdf output format, and
causes a depen- dency record to be written to the output
file which indicates that the program requires a certain
library in order to run.</p>

<p>MACRO PREPROCESSOR Single-line macros are defined using
the %define or %idefine commands, in a similar fashion to
the C preprocessor. They can be overloaded with respect to
number of parameters, although defining a macro with no
parameters prevents the definition of any macro with the
same name tak- ing parameters, and vice versa. %define
defines macros whose names match case-sensitively, whereas
%idefine defines case-insensitive macros.</p>

<p>Multi-line macros are defined using %macro and %imacro
(the distinction is the same as that between %define and
%idefine), whose syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>%macro name minprm[-maxprm][+][.nolist] [defaults]
&lt;some lines of macro expansion text&gt; %endmacro</p>

<p>Again, these macros may be overloaded. The trailing plus
sign indicates that any parameters after the last one get
subsumed, with their sepa- rating commas, into the last
parameter. The defaults part can be used to specify defaults
for unspecified macro parameters after minparam. %endm is a
valid synonym for %endmacro.</p>

<p>To refer to the macro parameters within a macro
expansion, you use %1, %2 and so on. You can also enforce
that a macro parameter should con- tain a condition code by
using %+1, and you can invert the condition code by using
%-1. You can also define a label specific to a macro
invocation by prefixing it with a double % sign.</p>

<p>Files can be included using the %include directive,
which works like C.</p>

<p>The preprocessor has a context stack, which may be used
by one macro to store information that a later one will
retrieve. You can push a context on the stack using %push,
remove one using %pop, and change the name of the top
context (without disturbing any associated definitions)
using %repl. Labels and %define macros specific to the top
context may be defined by prefixing their names with %$, and
things specific to the next context down with %$$, and so
on.</p>

<p>Conditional assembly is done by means of %ifdef,
%ifndef, %else and %endif as in C. (Except that %ifdef can
accept several putative macro names, and will evaluate TRUE
if any of them is defined.) In addition, the directives
%ifctx and %ifnctx can be used to condition on the name of
the top context on the context stack. The obvious set of
else-if directives, %elifdef, %elifndef, %elifctx and
%elifnctx are also supported.</p>
