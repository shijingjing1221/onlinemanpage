<p>NAME XmCreateOptionMenu A RowColumn widget convenience
creation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmCreateOptionMenu( Widget parent, String name, ArgList
arglist, Cardinal argcount);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmCreateOptionMenu creates an instance of a
RowColumn widget of type XmMENU_OPTION and returns the
associated widget ID.</p>

<p>It is provided as a convenience function for creating a
RowColumn wid- get configured to operate as an OptionMenu
and is not implemented as a separate widget class.</p>

<p>The OptionMenu widget is a specialized RowColumn manager
composed of a label, a selection area, and a single Pulldown
menu pane. When an application creates an OptionMenu widget,
it supplies the label string and the Pulldown menu pane. In
order for the operation to be success- ful, there must be a
valid XmNsubMenuId resource set when this function is
called. The LabelGadget and the selection area (a
CascadeButtonGad- get) are created by the OptionMenu.</p>

<p>The OptionMenus Pulldown menu pane must not contain any
ToggleButtons or ToggleButtonGadgets. The results of
including CascadeButtons or CascadeButtonGadgets in the
OptionMenus Pulldown menu pane are unde- fined.</p>

<p>An OptionMenu is laid out with the label displayed on
one side of the widget and the selection area on the other
side when XmNorientation is XmHORIZONTAL. The layout of the
label with respect to the selection area depends on the
XmNlayoutDirection resource in the horizontal ori- entation.
If the value is XmVERTICAL, the label is above the selection
area. The selection area has a dual purpose; it displays the
label of the last item selected from the associated Pulldown
menu pane, and it provides the means for posting the
Pulldown menu pane.</p>

<p>The OptionMenu typically does not display any 3-D
visuals around itself or the internal LabelGadget. By
default, the internal CascadeButtonGad- get has a visible
3-D shadow. The application may change this by get- ting the
CascadeButtonGadget ID using XmOptionButtonGadget, and then
calling XtSetValues using the standard visual-related
resources.</p>

<p>The Pulldown menu pane is posted when the mouse pointer
is moved over the selection area and a mouse button that is
defined by OptionMenus RowColumn parent is pressed. The
Pulldown menu pane is posted and positioned so that the last
selected item is directly over the selec- tion area. The
mouse is then used to arm the desired menu item. When the
mouse button is released, the armed menu item is selected
and the label within the selection area is changed to match
that of the selected item. By default, BSelect is used to
interact with an Option- Menu. The default can be changed
with the RowColumn resource XmNmenu- Post.</p>

<p>The OptionMenu also operates with the keyboard interface
mechanism. If the application has established a mnemonic
with the OptionMenu, press- ing &lt;Alt&gt; with the
mnemonic causes the Pulldown menu pane to be posted with
traversal enabled. The standard traversal keys can then be
used to move within the menu pane. Pressing &lt;Return&gt;
or typing a mnemonic or accelerator for one of the menu
items selects that item.</p>

<p>An application may use the XmNmenuHistory resource to
indicate which item in the Pulldown menu pane should be
treated as the current choice and have its label displayed
in the selection area. By default, the first selectable item
in the Pulldown menu pane is used.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the parent widget ID</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the created widget</p>

<p>arglist Specifies the argument list</p>

<p>argcount Specifies the number of attribute/value pairs
in the argument list (arglist)</p>

<p>The user can specify resources in a resource file for
the automatically created widgets and gadgets of an
OptionMenu. These widgets (or gad- gets) and the associated
OptionMenu areas are</p>

<p>Option Menu Label Gadget OptionLabel</p>

<p>Option Menu Cascade Button OptionButton</p>

associated resources, see XmRowColumn(3).</p>
