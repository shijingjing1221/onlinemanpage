<p>STRRCHR(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRRCHR(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strrchr - string scanning operation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strrchr() function shall locate the last
occurrence of c (converted to a char) in the string pointed
to by s. The terminating null byte is considered to be part
of the string.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, strrchr() shall
return a pointer to the byte or a null pointer if c does not
occur in the string.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Finding the Base Name of a File The following
example uses strrchr() to get a pointer to the base name of
a file. The strrchr() function searches backwards through
the name of the file to find the last/character in name.
This pointer (plus one) will point to the base name of the
file.</p>

<p>#include &lt;string.h&gt; ... const char *name; char
*basename; ... basename = strrchr(name,) + 1; ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
