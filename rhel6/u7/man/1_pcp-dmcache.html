<p>PCP-DMCACHE(1) PCP-DMCACHE(1)</p>

<p>NAME pcp-dmcache, pcp-lvmcache - report on logical
storage device caches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pcp-dmcache [-i/--iops] [-R/--repeat N] [device
...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pcp-dmcache reports on the activity of any
configured Device Mapper Cache targets. The reported
information includes device IOPs, cache and metadata device
utilization, as well as hit and miss rates and ratios for
both reads and writes for each cache device.</p>

<p>pcp-lvmcache (Logical Volume Manager cache) is an exact
synonym for pcp-dmcache (Device Mapper cache).</p>

<p>When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host,
-a/--archive, -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval,
-Z/--timezone and several other options become indirectly
available.</p>

<p>By default, pcp-dmcache reports on all available cache
target devices (one line each, per sample), but this can be
restricted to specific devices on the command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Additional options are available for changing
the output displayed by pcp-dmcache.</p>

<p>-i/--iops displays total read and write operations
instead of the default cache hit ratio.</p>

<p>-R/--repeat changes the frequency at which the column
heading is dis- played. By default, a header is displayed
after every tenth sample.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pcp(1), pmdadm(1), dmsetup(1), PCPIntro(1) and
LVMCACHE(7).</p>
