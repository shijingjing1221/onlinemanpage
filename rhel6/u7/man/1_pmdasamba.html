<p>PMDASAMBA(1) Performance Co-Pilot PMDASAMBA(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdasamba - Samba performance metrics domain agent
(PMDA)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdasamba is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values from Samba, a
Windows SMB/CIFS server for UNIX.</p>

<p>In order for values to be made available by this PMDA,
Samba must have been built with profiling support
(WITH_PROFILE in &quot;smbd -b&quot; output). This PMDA
dynamically enumerates much of its metric hierarchy, based
on the contents of &quot;smbstatus --profile&quot;.</p>

<p>When the agent is installed (see below), the Install
script will attempt to enable Samba statistics gathering,
using &quot;smbcontrol --profile&quot;.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names and values
for the samba performance metrics, do the following as
root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/samba # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/samba # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdasamba is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/samba/Install installation script
for the pmdasamba agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/samba/Remove undo installation script for
the pmdasamba agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/samba.log default log file for error
messages from pmdasamba</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pmcd(1), smbd(1) and samba(7).</p>
