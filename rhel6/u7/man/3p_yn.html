<p>Y0(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual Y0(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME y0, y1, yn - Bessel functions of the second
kind</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt;</p>

<p>double y0(double x); double y1(double x); double yn(int
n, double x);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The y0(), y1(), and yn() functions shall
compute Bessel functions of x of the second kind of orders
0, 1, and n, respectively.</p>

<p>An application wishing to check for error situations
should set errno to zero and call
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID |
FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the relevant Bessel value of x of the second
kind.</p>

<p>If x is NaN, NaN shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the x argument to these functions is negative,
-HUGE_VAL or NaN shall be returned, and a domain error may
occur.</p>

<p>If x is 0.0, -HUGE_VAL shall be returned and a range
error may occur.</p>

<p>If the correct result would cause underflow, 0.0 shall
be returned and a range error may occur.</p>

<p>If the correct result would cause overflow, -HUGE_VAL or
0.0 shall be returned and a range error may occur.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>Domain Error The value of x is negative.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to [EDOM].
If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid floating-point
exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>Range Error The value of x is 0.0, or the correct result
would cause over- flow.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the overflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>Range Error The value of x is too large in magnitude, or
the correct result would cause underflow.</p>

<p>If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
[ERANGE]. If the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the underflow
floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On error, the expressions
(math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
&amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each other, but at
least one of them must be non-zero.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
