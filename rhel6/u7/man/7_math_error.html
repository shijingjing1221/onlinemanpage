<p>NAME math_error - detecting errors from mathematical
functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;math.h&gt; #include
&lt;errno.h&gt; #include &lt;fenv.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION When an error occurs, most library functions
indicate this fact by returning a special value (e.g., -1 or
NULL). Because they typically return a floating-point
number, the mathematical functions declared in
&lt;math.h&gt; indicate an error using other mechanisms.
There are two error-reporting mechanisms: the older one sets
errno; the newer one uses the floating-point exception
mechanism (the use of feclearex- cept(3) and
fetestexcept(3), as outlined below) described in
fenv(3).</p>

<p>A portable program that needs to check for an error from
a mathematical function should set errno to zero, and make
the following call</p>

<p>feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);</p>

<p>before calling a mathematical function.</p>

<p>Upon return from the mathematical function, if errno is
non-zero, or the following call (see fenv(3)) returns
non-zero</p>

<p>fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW |
FE_UNDERFLOW);</p>

<p>then an error occurred in the mathematical function.</p>

<p>The error conditions that can occur for mathematical
functions are described below.</p>

<p>Domain Error A domain error occurs when a mathematical
function is supplied with an argument whose value falls
outside the domain for which the function is defined (e.g.,
giving a negative argument to log(3)). When a domain error
occurs, math functions commonly return a NaN (though some
func- tions return a different value in this case); errno is
set to EDOM, and an &quot;invalid&quot; (FE_INVALID)
floating-point exception is raised.</p>

<p>Pole Error A pole error occurs when the mathematical
result of a function is an exact infinity (e.g., the
logarithm of 0 is negative infinity). When a pole error
occurs, the function returns the (signed) value HUGE_VAL,
HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL, depending on whether the function
result type is double, float, or long double. The sign of
the result is that which is mathematically correct for the
function. errno is set to ERANGE, and a
&quot;divide-by-zero&quot; (FE_DIVBYZERO) floating-point
exception is raised.</p>

<p>Range Error A range error occurs when the magnitude of
the function result means that it cannot be represented in
the result type of the function. The return value of the
function depends on whether the range error was an overflow
or an underflow.</p>

<p>A floating result overflows if the result is finite, but
is too large to represented in the result type. When an
overflow occurs, the func- tion returns the value HUGE_VAL,
HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL, depending on whether the function
result type is double, float, or long double. errno is set
to ERANGE, and an &quot;overflow&quot; (FE_OVERFLOW)
floating-point exception is raised.</p>

<p>A floating result underflows if the result is too small
to be repre- sented in the result type. If an underflow
occurs, a mathematical function typically returns 0.0 (C99
says a function shall return &quot;an implementation-defined
value whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest
normalized positive number in the specified type&quot;).
errno may be set to ERANGE, and an &quot;overflow&quot;
(FE_UNDERFLOW) floating-point exception may be raised.</p>

<p>Some functions deliver a range error if the supplied
argument value, or the correct function result, would be
subnormal. A subnormal value is one that is non-zero, but
with a magnitude that is so small that it cant be presented
in normalized form (i.e., with a 1 in the most sig- nificant
bit of the significand). The representation of a subnormal
number will contain one or more leading zeros in the
significand.</p>

<p>NOTES The math_errhandling identifier specified by C99
and POSIX.1-2001 is not supported by glibc. This identifier
is supposed to indicate which of the two error-notification
mechanisms (errno, exceptions retrievable via
fettestexcept(3)) is in use. The standards require that at
least one be in use, but permit both to be available. The
current (version 2.8) situation under glibc is messy. Most
(but not all) functions raise exceptions on errors. Some
also set errno. A few functions set errno, but dont raise an
exception. A very few functions do neither. See the
individual manual pages for details.</p>

<p>To avoid the complexities of using errno and
fetestexcept(3) for error checking, it is often advised that
one should instead check for bad argument values before each
call. For example, the following code ensures that log(3)s
argument is not a NaN and is not zero (a pole error) or less
than zero (a domain error):</p>

<p>double x, r;</p>

<p>if (isnan(x) || islessequal(x, 0)) { /* Deal with NaN /
pole error / domain error */ }</p>

<p>r = log(x);</p>

<p>The discussion on this page does not apply to the
complex mathematical functions (i.e., those declared by
&lt;complex.h&gt;), which in general are not required to
return errors by C99 and POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>The gcc(1) -fno-math-errno option causes the executable
to employ implementations of some mathematical functions
that are faster than the standard implementations, but do
not set errno on error. (The gcc(1) -ffast-math option also
enables -fno-math-errno.) An error can still be tested for
using fetestexcept(3).</p>
