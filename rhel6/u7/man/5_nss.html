<p>NAME nss - Name Service Switch configuration file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Each call to a function which retrieves data
from a system database like the password or group database
is handled by the Name Service Switch implementation in the
GNU C library. The various services pro- vided are
implemented by independent modules, each of which naturally
varies widely from the other.</p>

<p>The default implementations coming with the GNU C
library are by default conservative and do not use unsafe
data. This might be very costly in some situations,
especially when the databases are large. Some modules allow
the system administrator to request taking shortcuts if
these are known to be safe. It is then the system
administrators responsibility to ensure the assumption is
correct.</p>

<p>There are other modules where the implementation changed
over time. If an implementation used to sacrifize speed for
memory consumption it might create problems if the
preference is switched.</p>

<p>The /etc/default/nss file contains a number of variable
assignments. Each variable controls the behavior of one or
more NSS modules. White spaces are ignored. Lines beginning
with # are treated as comments.</p>

<p>The variables currently recognized are:</p>

<p>NETID_AUTHORITATIVE = TRUE|FALSE If set to TRUE, the NIS
backend for the initgroups(3) function will accept the
information from the netid.byname NIS map as authoritative.
This can speed up the function significantly if the
group.byname map is large. The content of the netid.byname
map is used as is. The system administrator has to make sure
it is correctly generated.</p>

<p>SERVICES_AUTHORITATIVE = TRUE|FALSE If set to TRUE, the
NIS backend for the getservbyname(3) and getservbyname_r(3)
function will assume services.byservicename NIS map exists
and is authoritative, particularly that it con- tains both
keys with /proto and without /proto for both primary service
names and service aliases. The system administrator has to
make sure it is correctly generated.</p>

<p>SETENT_BATCH_READ = TRUE|FALSE If set to TRUE, the NIS
backend for the setpwent(3) and set- grent(3) functions will
read the entire database at once and then hand out the
requests one by one from memory with every corresponding
getpwent(3) or getgrent(3) call respectively. Otherwise each
getpwent(3) or getgrent(3) call might result into a network
communication with the server to get the next entry.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The default configuration corresponds to the
following configuration file:</p>

<p>NETID_AUTHORITATIVE=FALSE SERVICES_AUTHORITATIVE=FALSE
SETENT_BATCH_READ=FALSE</p>
