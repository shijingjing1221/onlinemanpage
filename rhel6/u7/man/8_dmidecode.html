<p>NAME dmidecode - DMI table decoder</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dmidecode [OPTIONS]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dmidecode is a tool for dumping a computers
DMI (some say SMBIOS) ta- ble contents in a human-readable
format. This table contains a descrip- tion of the systems
hardware components, as well as other useful pieces of
information such as serial numbers and BIOS revision. Thanks
to this table, you can retrieve this information without
having to probe for the actual hardware. While this is a
good point in terms of report speed and safeness, this also
makes the presented information possibly unreliable.</p>

<p>The DMI table doesn t only describe what the system is
currently made of, it also can report the possible
evolutions (such as the fastest supported CPU or the maximal
amount of memory supported).</p>

<p>SMBIOS stands for System Management BIOS, while DMI
stands for Desktop Management Interface. Both standards are
tightly related and developed by the DMTF (Desktop
Management Task Force).</p>

<p>As you run it, dmidecode will try to locate the DMI
table. If it suc- ceeds, it will then parse this table and
display a list of records like this one:</p>

<p>Handle 0x0002, DMI type 2, 8 bytes. Base Board
Information Manufacturer: Intel Product Name: C440GX+
Version: 727281-001 Serial Number: INCY92700942</p>

<p>Each record has:</p>

<p>&middot; A handle. This is a unique identifier, which
allows records to refer- ence each other. For example,
processor records usually reference cache memory records
using their handles.</p>

<p>&middot; A type. The SMBIOS specification defines
different types of elements a computer can be made of. In
this example, the type is 2, which means that the record
contains &quot;Base Board Information&quot;.</p>

<p>&middot; A size. Each record has a 4-byte header (2 for
the handle, 1 for the type, 1 for the size), the rest is
used by the record data. This value doesnt take text strings
into account (these are placed at the end of the record), so
the actual length of the record may be (and is often)
greater than the displayed value.</p>

<p>&middot; Decoded values. The information presented of
course depends on the type of record. Here, we learn about
the board s manufacturer, model, version and serial
number.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d, --dev-mem FILE Read memory from device FILE
(default: /dev/mem)</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Be less verbose. Unknown, inactive and
OEM-specific entries are not displayed. Meta-data and handle
references are hidden.</p>

<p>-s, --string KEYWORD Only display the value of the DMI
string identified by KEYWORD, and if applicable a warning
about unsupported SMBIOS (see below). KEYWORD must be a
keyword from the following list: bios-vendor, bios-version,
bios-release-date, system-manufac- turer,
system-product-name, system-version, system-serial-num- ber,
system-uuid, baseboard-manufacturer, baseboard-product-
name, baseboard-version, baseboard-serial-number, baseboard-
asset-tag, chassis-manufacturer, chassis-type,
chassis-version, chassis-serial-number, chassis-asset-tag,
processor-family, pro- cessor-manufacturer,
processor-version, processor-frequency. Each keyword
corresponds to a given DMI type and a given offset within
this entry type. Not all strings may be meaningful or even
defined on all systems. Some keywords may return more than
one result on some systems (e.g. processor-version on a
multi- processor system). If KEYWORD is not provided or not
valid, a list of all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode
exits with an error. This option cannot be used more than
once.</p>

<p>-t, --type TYPE Only display the entries of type TYPE,
and if applicable a warn- ing about unsupported SMBIOS (see
below). TYPE can be either a DMI type number, or a
comma-separated list of type numbers, or a keyword from the
following list: bios, system, baseboard, chas- sis,
processor, memory, cache, connector, slot. Refer to the DMI
TYPES section below for details. If this option is used more
than once, the set of displayed entries will be the union of
all the given types. If TYPE is not provided or not valid, a
list of all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode exits
with an error.</p>

<p>-u, --dump Do not decode the entries, dump their
contents as hexadecimal instead. Note that this is still a
text output, no binary data will be thrown upon you. The
strings attached to each entry are displayed as both
hexadecimal and ASCII. This option is mainly useful for
debugging.</p>

<p>--dump-bin FILE Do not decode the entries, instead dump
the DMI data to a file in binary form. The generated file is
suitable to pass to --from-dump later.</p>

<p>--from-dump FILE Read the DMI data from a binary file
previously generated using --dump-bin.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display usage information and exit</p>

<p>-V, --version Display the version and exit</p>

<p>Options --string, --type and --dump-bin determine the
output format and are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Please note in case of dmidecode is run on a system with
BIOS that boasts new SMBIOS specification, which is not
supported by the tool yet, it will print out relevant
message in addition to requested data on the very top of the
output. Thus informs the output data is not reliable.</p>

<p>DMI TYPES The SMBIOS specification defines the following
DMI types:</p>

<p>Type Information
-------------------------------------------- 0 BIOS 1 System
2 Baseboard 3 Chassis 4 Processor 5 Memory Controller 6
Memory Module 7 Cache 8 Port Connector 9 System Slots 10 On
Board Devices 11 OEM Strings 12 System Configuration Options
13 BIOS Language 14 Group Associations 15 System Event Log
16 Physical Memory Array 17 Memory Device 18 32-bit Memory
Error 19 Memory Array Mapped Address 20 Memory Device Mapped
Address 21 Built-in Pointing Device 22 Portable Battery 23
System Reset 24 Hardware Security 25 System Power Controls
26 Voltage Probe 27 Cooling Device 28 Temperature Probe 29
Electrical Current Probe 30 Out-of-band Remote Access 31
Boot Integrity Services 32 System Boot 33 64-bit Memory
Error 34 Management Device 35 Management Device Component 36
Management Device Threshold Data 37 Memory Channel 38 IPMI
Device 39 Power Supply 40 Additional Information 41 Onboard
Devices Extended Information 42 Management Controller Host
Interface</p>

<p>Additionally, type 126 is used for disabled entries and
type 127 is an end-of-table marker. Types 128 to 255 are for
OEM-specific data. dmidecode will display these entries by
default, but it can only decode them when the vendors have
contributed documentation or code for them.</p>

<p>Keywords can be used instead of type numbers with
--type. Each keyword is equivalent to a list of type
numbers:</p>

<p>Keyword Types ------------------------------ bios 0, 13
system 1, 12, 15, 23, 32 baseboard 2, 10, 41 chassis 3
processor 4 memory 5, 6, 16, 17 cache 7 connector 8</p>

<p>slot 9</p>

<p>Keywords are matched case-insensitively. The following
command lines are equivalent:</p>

<p>&middot; dmidecode --type 0 --type 13</p>

<p>&middot; dmidecode --type 0,13</p>

<p>&middot; dmidecode --type bios</p>

<p>&middot; dmidecode --type BIOS</p>

<p>BINARY DUMP FILE FORMAT The binary dump files generated
by --dump-bin and read using --from- dump are formatted as
follows:</p>

<p>&middot; The SMBIOS or DMI entry point is located at
offset 0x00. It is crafted to hard-code the table address at
offset 0x20.</p>

<p>&middot; The DMI table is located at offset 0x20.</p>

<p>FILES /dev/mem</p>

<p>BUGS More often than not, information contained in the
DMI tables is inaccu- rate, incomplete or simply wrong.</p>
