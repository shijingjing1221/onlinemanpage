<p>SNMPWALK(1) Net-SNMP SNMPWALK(1)</p>

<p>NAME snmpwalk - retrieve a subtree of management values
using SNMP GETNEXT requests</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpwalk [APPLICATION OPTIONS] [COMMON OPTIONS]
[OID]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION snmpwalk is an SNMP application that uses
SNMP GETNEXT requests to query a network entity for a tree
of information.</p>

<p>An object identifier (OID) may be given on the command
line. This OID specifies which portion of the object
identifier space will be searched using GETNEXT requests.
All variables in the subtree below the given OID are queried
and their values presented to the user. Each variable name
is given in the format specified in variables(5).</p>

<p>If no OID argument is present, snmpwalk will search the
subtree rooted at SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2 (including any MIB
object values from other MIB modules, that are defined as
lying within this subtree). If the net- work entity has an
error processing the request packet, an error packet will be
returned and a message will be shown, helping to pinpoint
why the request was malformed.</p>

<p>If the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the
end of the MIB, the message &quot;End of MIB&quot; will be
displayed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -Cc Do not check whether the returned OIDs are
increasing. Some agents (LaserJets are an example) return
OIDs out of order, but can complete the walk anyway. Other
agents return OIDs that are out of order and can cause
snmpwalk to loop indefinitely. By default, snmpwalk tries to
detect this behavior and warns you when it hits an agent
acting illegally. Use -Cc to turn off this check.</p>

<p>-CE {OID} End the walk at the specified OID, rather than
a simple sub- tree. This can be used to walk a partial
subtree, selected columns of a table, or even two or more
tables within a single command.</p>

<p>-Ci Include the given OID in the search range. Normally
snmpwalk uses GETNEXT requests starting with the OID you
specified and returns all results in the MIB subtree rooted
at that OID. Sometimes, you may wish to include the OID
specified on the command line in the printed results if it
is a valid OID in the tree itself. This option lets you do
this explicitly.</p>

<p>-CI In fact, the given OID will be retrieved
automatically if the main subtree walk returns no useable
values. This allows a walk of a single instance to behave as
generally expected, and return the specified instance value.
This option turns off this final GET request, so a walk of a
single instance will return nothing.</p>

<p>-Cp Upon completion of the walk, print the number of
variables found.</p>

<p>-Ct Upon completion of the walk, print the total
wall-clock time it took to collect the data (in seconds).
Note that the timer is started just before the beginning of
the data request series and stopped just after it finishes.
Most importantly, this means that it does not include snmp
library initialization, shutdown, argument processing, and
any other overhead.</p>

<p>In addition to these options, snmpwalk takes the common
options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The command:</p>

<p>snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 zeus system</p>

<p>will retrieve all of the variables under system:</p>

<p>sysDescr.0 = STRING: &quot;SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu
4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m&quot; sysObjectID.0 = OID:
enterprises.hp.nm.hpsystem.10.1.1 sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks:
(155274552) 17 days, 23:19:05 sysContact.0 = STRING:
&quot;&quot; sysName.0 = STRING:
&quot;zeus.net.cmu.edu&quot; sysLocation.0 = STRING:
&quot;&quot; sysServices.0 = INTEGER: 72 (plus the contents
of the sysORTable).</p>

<p>The command:</p>

<p>snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 -CE sysORTable zeus
system</p>

<p>will retrieve the scalar values, but omit the
sysORTable.</p>
