<p>NAME pmdaweblog - performance metrics domain agent
(PMDA) for Web server logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog/pmdaweblog [-Cp] [-d
domain] [-h helpfile] [-i port] [-l logfile] [-n idlesec]
[-S num] [-t delay] [-u socket] [-U username] configfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaweblog is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA(3)) that scans Web server logs to extract
metrics characterizing Web server activity. These
performance metrics are then made available through the
infras- tructure of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).</p>

<p>The configfile specifies which Web servers are to be
monitored, their associated access logs and error logs, and
a regular-expression based scheme for extracting detailed
information about each Web access. This file is maintained
as part of the PMDA installation and/or de-installa- tion by
the scripts Install and Remove in the directory
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog. For more details, refer to the
section below covering installation.</p>

<p>Once started, pmdaweblog monitors a set of log files and
in response to a request for information, will process any
new information that has been appended to the log files,
similar to a tail(1). There is also periodic &quot;catch
up&quot; to process new information from all log files, and
a scheme to detect the rotation of log files.</p>

<p>Like all other PMDAs, pmdaweblog is launched by pmcd(1)
using command line options specified in $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH -
the Install script will prompt for appropriate values for
the command line options, and update $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdaweblog command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-C Check the configuration and exit.</p>

<p>-d domain Specify the domain number. It is absolutely
crucial that the performance metrics domain number specified
here is unique and consistent. That is, domain should be
different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
domain number should be used for the pmdaweblog PMDA on all
hosts.</p>

<p>For most installations, the default domain as
encapsulated in the file $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog/domain.h will
suffice. For alternate values, check $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH for
the domain values already in use on this host, and the file
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid contains a repository of well
known domain assignments that probably should be
avoided.</p>

<p>-h helpfile Get the help text from the supplied helpfile
rather than from the default location.</p>

<p>-i port Communicate with pmcd(1) on the specified
Internet port (which may be a number or a name).</p>

<p>-l logfile Location of the log file. By default, a log
file named weblog.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdaweblog is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.
If the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output
is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-n idlesec If a Web server log file has not been
modified for idlesec sec- onds, then the file will be closed
and re-opened. This is the only way pmdaweblog can detect
any asynchronous rotation of the logs by Web server
administrative scripts. The default period is 20 seconds.
This value may be changed dynamically using pmstore(1) to
modify the value of the performance metric
web.config.check.</p>

<p>-p Communicate with pmcd(1) via a pipe.</p>

<p>-S num Specify the maximum number of Web servers per
sproc. It may be desirable (from a latency and load
balancing perspective) or necessary (due to file descriptor
limits) to delegate responsi- bility for scanning the Web
server log files to several sprocs. pmdaweblog will ensure
that each sproc handles the log files for at most num Web
servers. The default value is 80 Web servers per sproc.</p>

<p>-t delay To avoid the need to scan a lot of information
from the Web server logs in response to a single request for
performance met- rics, all log files will be checked at
least once every delay seconds. The default is 15 seconds.
This value may by changed dynamically using pmstore(1) to
modify the value of the perfor- mance metric
web.config.catchup.</p>

<p>-u socket Communicate with pmcd(1) via the given Unix
domain socket.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION The PCP framework allows metrics to be
collected on one host and moni- tored from another. These
hosts are referred to as collector and moni- tor hosts,
respectively. A host may be both a collector and a
monitor.</p>

<p>Collector hosts require the installation of the agent,
while monitoring hosts require no agent installation at
all.</p>

<p>For collector hosts do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog # ./Install</p>

<p>The installation procedure prompts for a default or
non-default instal- lation. A default installation will
search for known server configura- tions and automatically
configure the PMDA for any server log files that are found.
A non-default installation will step through each server,
prompting the user for other server configurations and argu-
ments to pmdaweblog. The end result of a collector
installation is to build a configuration file that is passed
to pmdaweblog via the config- file argument.</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdaweblog is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION The configuration file for the weblog PMDA
is an ASCII file that can be easily modified. Empty lines
and lines beginning with # are ignored. All other lines must
be either a regular expression or server specifi-
cation.</p>

<p>Regular expressions, which are used on both the access
and error log files, must be of the form:</p>

<p>regex regexName regexp or</p>

<p>regex_posix regexName ordering regexp_posix</p>

<p>The regexName is a word which uniquely identifies the
regular expres- sion. This is the reference used in the
server specification. The regexp for access logs is in the
format described for regcmp(3). The regexp_posix for access
logs is in the format described for regcomp(3). The argument
ordering is explained below. The Posix form should be
available on all platforms.</p>

<p>The regular expression requires the specification of up
to four argu- ments to be extracted from each line of a Web
server access log, depending on the type of server. In the
most common case there are two arguments representing the
method and the size.</p>

<p>For the non- Posix version, argument $0 should contain
the method: GET, HEAD , POST or PUT. The method PUT is
treated as a synonym for POST, and anything else is
categorized as OTHER.</p>

<p>The second argument, $1, should contain the size of the
request. A size of - or is treated as unknown.</p>

<p>Argument $3 should contain the status code returned to
the client browser and argument $4 should contain the status
code returned to the server from a remote host. These latter
two arguments are used for caching servers and must be
specified as a pair (or $3 will be ignored). For further
information on status codes, refer to the web site
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html</p>

<p>Some legal non- Posix regex expression specifications
for monitoring an access log are:</p>

<p># pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Access Logs regex
CERN ] &quot;([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)$0 .*&quot; [-0-9]+
([-0-9]+)$1</p>

<p># pattern for FTP Server access logs (normally in
SYSLOG) regex SYSLOG_FTP ftpd[.*]: ([gp][-A-Za-z]+)$0(
)$1</p>

<p>There is 1 special types of access logs with the
RegexName SQUID. This formats extract 4 parameters but since
the Squid log file uses text- based status codes, it is
handled as a special case.</p>

<p>In the examples below, NS_PROXY parses the Netscape/W3C
Common Extended Log Format and SQUID parses the default
Squid Object Cache format log file.</p>

<p># pattern for Netscape Proxy Server Extended Logs regex
NS_PROXY ] &quot;([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)$0 .*&quot; ([-0-9]+)$2
([-0-9]+)$1 ([-0-9]+)$3</p>

<p># pattern for Squid Cache logs regex SQUID
[0-9]+.[0-9]+[ ]+[0-9]+ [a-zA-Z0-9.]+ ([_A-Z]+)$3([0-9]+)$2
([0-9]+)$1 ([A-Z]+)$0</p>

<p>The regexp for the error logs does not require any
arguments, only a match. Some legal expressions are:</p>

<p># pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Error Logs regex
CERN_err .</p>

<p># pattern for FTP Server error logs (normally in SYSLOG)
regex SYSLOG_FTP_err FTP LOGIN FAILED</p>

<p>If POSIX compliant regular expressions are used,
additional information is required since the order of
parameters cannot be specified in the regular expression.
For backwards compatibility, the common case of two
parameters the order may be specified as method,size or
size,method In the general case, the ordering is specified
by one of the following methods:</p>

<p>n1,n2,n3,n4 where nX is a digit between 1 and 4. Each
comma-seperated field represents (in order) the argument
number for method,size,client_status,server_status</p>

<p>- Used for cases like the error logs where the content
is ignored.</p>

<p>As for the non- Posix format, the SQUID RegexName is
treated as a spe- cial case to match the non-numerical
status codes.</p>

<p>Some legal Posix regex expression specifications for
monitoring an access log are:</p>

<p># pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape, Apache etc Access
Logs regex_posix CERN method,size ][
]+&quot;([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+) [^&quot;]*&quot; [-0-9]+
([-0-9]+)</p>

<p># pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape, Apache etc Access
Logs regex_posix CERN 1,2 ][ ]+&quot;([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)
[^&quot;]*&quot; [-0-9]+ ([-0-9]+)</p>

<p># pattern for FTP Server access logs (normally in
SYSLOG) regex_posix SYSLOG_FTP method,size ftpd[.*]:
([gp][-A-Za-z]+)( )</p>

<p># pattern for Netscape Proxy Server Extended Logs
regex_posix NS_PROXY 1,3,2,4 ][ ]+&quot;([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)
[^&quot;]*&quot; ([-0-9]+) ([-0-9]+) ([-0-9]+)</p>

<p># pattern for Squid Cache logs regex_posix SQUID 4,3,2,1
[0-9]+.[0-9]+[ ]+[0-9]+ [a-zA-Z0-9.]+ ([_A-Z]+)([0-9]+)
([0-9]+) ([A-Z]+)</p>

<p># pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Error Logs
regex_posix CERN_err - .</p>

<p># pattern for FTP Server error logs (normally in SYSLOG)
regex_posix SYSLOG_FTP_err - FTP LOGIN FAILED</p>

<p>A Web server can be specified using this syntax:</p>

<p>server serverName on|off accessRegex accessFile
errorRegex errorFile</p>

<p>The serverName must be unique for each server, and is
the name given to the instance for the associated
performance metrics. See PMAPI(3) for a discussion of PCP
instance domains. The on or off flag indicates whether the
server is to be monitored when the PMDA is installed. This
can altered dynamically using pmstore(1) for the metric
web.perserver.watched, which has one instance for each Web
server named in configfile.</p>

<p>Two files are monitored for each Web server, the access
and the error log. Each file requires the name of a
previously declared regular expression, and a file name. The
log files specified for each server do not have to exist
when the weblog PMDA is installed. The PMDA will continue to
check for non-existent log files and open them when possi-
ble. Some legal server specifications are:</p>

<p># Netscape Server on Port 80 at IP address
127.55.555.555 server 127.55.555.555:80 on CERN /logs/access
CERN_err /logs/errors</p>

<p># FTP Server. server ftpd on SYSLOG_FTP
/var/log/messages SYSLOG_FTP_err /var/log/messages</p>

<p>CAVEATS Specifying regular expressions with an incorrect
number of arguments, anything other than 2 for access logs,
and none for error logs, may cause the PMDA to behave
incorrectly and even crash. This is due to limitations in
the interface of regex(3).</p>
