<p>CFREE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual CFREE(3)</p>

<p>NAME cfree - free allocated memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>/* In SunOS 4 */ int cfree(void *ptr);</p>

<p>/* In glibc or FreeBSD libcompat */ void cfree(void
*ptr);</p>

<p>/* In SCO OpenServer */ void cfree(char *ptr, unsigned
num, unsigned size);</p>

<p>/* In Solaris watchmalloc.so.1 */ void cfree(void *ptr,
size_t nelem, size_t elsize);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>cfree(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function should never be used. Use
free(3) instead.</p>

<p>1-arg cfree In glibc, the function cfree() is a synonym
for free(3), &quot;added for compatibility with
SunOS&quot;.</p>

<p>Other systems have other functions with this name. The
declaration is sometimes in &lt;stdlib.h&gt; and sometimes
in &lt;malloc.h&gt;.</p>

<p>3-arg cfree Some SCO and Solaris versions have malloc
libraries with a 3-argument cfree(), apparently as an analog
to calloc(3).</p>

<p>If you need it while porting something, add</p>

<p>#define cfree(p, n, s) free((p))</p>

<p>to your file.</p>

<p>A frequently asked question is &quot;Can I use free(3)
to free memory allo- cated with calloc(3), or do I need
cfree()?&quot; Answer: use free(3).</p>

<p>An SCO manual writes: &quot;The cfree routine is
provided for compliance to the iBCSe2 standard and simply
calls free. The num and size arguments to cfree are not
used.&quot;</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The SunOS version of cfree() (which is a
synonym for free(3)) returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
In case of error, errno is set to EINVAL: the value of ptr
was not a pointer to a block previously allocated by one of
the routines in the malloc(3) family.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The 3-argument version of cfree() as used
by SCO conforms to the iBCSe2 standard: Intel386 Binary
Compatibility Specification, Edition 2.</p>
