<p>NAME XmTextFieldCut A TextField function that copies the
primary selection to the clipboard and deletes the selected
text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/TextF.h&gt; Boolean
XmTextFieldCut( Widget widget, Time time);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmTextFieldCut copies the primary selected
text to the clipboard and then deletes the primary selected
text. This routine calls the wid- get s
XmNvalueChangedCallback and verification callbacks, either
XmN- modifyVerifyCallback or XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs, or
both. If both verification callback lists are registered,
the procedures of the XmN- modifyVerifyCallback list are
executed first and the resulting data is passed to the
XmNmodifyVerifyCallbackWcs callbacks.</p>

<p>This routine calls the XmNconvertCallback procedures,
possibly multiple times, with the selection member of the
XmConvertCallbackStruct set to CLIPBOARD and with the parm
member set to XmMOVE. If the transfer is successful, this
routine then calls the XmNconvertCallback procedures for the
CLIPBOARD selection and the DELETE target.</p>

<p>widget Specifies the TextField widget ID.</p>

<p>time Specifies the time at which the selection value is
to be mod- ified. This should be the time of the event that
triggered this request.</p>

<p>For a complete definition of TextField and its
associated resources, see XmTextField(3).</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns False if the primary
selection is NULL, if the widget does not own the primary
selection, if the function is unable to gain ownership of
the clipboard selection, or if no data is placed on the
clipboard. Otherwise, it returns True.</p>
