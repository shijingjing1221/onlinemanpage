<p>BZMORE(1) BZMORE(1)</p>

<p>NAME bzmore, bzless - file perusal filter for crt
viewing of bzip2 com- pressed text</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS bzmore [ name ... ] bzless [ name ... ]</p>

<p>NOTE In the following description, bzless and less can
be used interchange- ably with bzmore and more.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Bzmore is a filter which allows examination
of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on
a soft-copy terminal. bzmore works on files compressed with
bzip2 and also on uncompressed files. If a file does not
exist, bzmore looks for a file of the same name with the
addi- tion of a .bz2 suffix.</p>

<p>Bzmore normally pauses after each screenful, printing
--More-- at the bottom of the screen. If the user then types
a carriage return, one more line is displayed. If the user
hits a space, another screenful is displayed. Other
possibilities are enumerated later.</p>

<p>Bzmore looks in the file /etc/termcap to determine
terminal character- istics, and to determine the default
window size. On a terminal capa- ble of displaying 24 lines,
the default window size is 22 lines. Other sequences which
may be typed when bzmore pauses, and their effects, are as
follows (i is an optional integer argument, defaulting to 1)
:</p>

<p>i&lt;space&gt; display i more lines, (or another
screenful if no argument is given)</p>

<p>^D display 11 more lines (a scroll). If i is given, then
the scroll size is set to i.</p>

<p>d same as ^D (control-D)</p>

<p>iz same as typing a space except that i, if present,
becomes the new window size. Note that the window size
reverts back to the default at the end of the current
file.</p>

<p>is skip i lines and print a screenful of lines</p>

<p>if skip i screenfuls and print a screenful of lines</p>

<p>q or Q quit reading the current file; go on to the next
(if any)</p>

<p>e or q When the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is
printed, this com- mand causes bzmore to exit.</p>

<p>s When the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is printed,
this com- mand causes bzmore to skip the next file and
continue.</p>

<p>= Display the current line number.</p>

<p>i/expr search for the i-th occurrence of the regular
expression expr. If the pattern is not found, bzmore goes on
to the next file (if any). Otherwise, a screenful is
displayed, starting two lines before the place where the
expression was found. The users erase and kill characters
may be used to edit the regular expression. Erasing back
past the first column cancels the search command.</p>

<p>in search for the i-th occurrence of the last regular
expression entered.</p>

<p>!command invoke a shell with command. The character ! in
&quot;command&quot; are replaced with the previous shell
command. The sequence &quot;&quot; is replaced by
&quot;!&quot;.</p>

<p>:q or :Q quit reading the current file; go on to the
next (if any) (same as q or Q).</p>

<p>. (dot) repeat the previous command.</p>

<p>The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not
necessary to type a carriage return. Up to the time when the
command character itself is given, the user may hit the line
kill character to cancel the numerical argument being
formed. In addition, the user may hit the erase charac- ter
to redisplay the --More-- message.</p>

<p>At any time when output is being sent to the terminal,
the user can hit the quit key (normally control-. Bzmore
will stop sending output, and will display the usual
--More-- prompt. The user may then enter one of the above
commands in the normal manner. Unfortunately, some output is
lost when this is done, due to the fact that any characters
waiting in the terminals output queue are flushed when the
quit signal occurs.</p>

<p>The terminal is set to noecho mode by this program so
that the output can be continuous. What you type will thus
not show on your terminal, except for the / and !
commands.</p>

<p>If the standard output is not a teletype, then bzmore
acts just like bzcat, except that a header is printed before
each file.</p>
