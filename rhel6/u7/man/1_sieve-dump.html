<p>SIEVE-DUMP(1) Pigeonhole SIEVE-DUMP(1)</p>

<p>NAME sieve-dump - Pigeonhole&rsquo;s Sieve script binary
dump tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sieve-dump [options] sieve-binary
[out-file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sieve-dump command is part of the
Pigeonhole Project (pigeon- hole(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC
5228) support to the Dovecot secure IMAP and POP3 server
(dovecot(1)).</p>

<p>Using the sieve-dump command, Sieve binaries, which are
produced for instance by sievec(1), can be transformed into
a human-readable textual representation. This can provide
valuable insight in how the Sieve script is executed. This
is also particularly useful to view corrupt binaries that
can result from bugs in the Sieve implementation. This tool
is intended mainly for development purposes, so normally
system administrators and users will not need to use this
tool.</p>

<p>The format of the output is not explained here in
detail, but it should be relatively easy to understand. The
Sieve binaries comprise a set of data blocks, each of which
can contain arbitrary data. For the base language
implementation two blocks are used: the first containing a
specification of all required language extensions and the
second con- taining the main Sieve program. Compiled Sieve
programs are represented as flat byte code and therefore the
dump of the main program is a dis- assembly listing of the
interpreter operations. Extensions can define new operations
and use additional blocks. Therefore, the output of
sieve-dump depends greatly on the language extensions used
when compil- ing the binary.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c config-file Alternative Dovecot configuration
file path.</p>

<p>-h Produce per-block hexdump output of the whole binary
instead of the normal human-readable output.</p>

<p>-x extensions Set the available extensions. The
parameter is a space-separated list of the active
extensions. By prepending the extension iden- tifiers with +
or -, extensions can be included or excluded rel- ative to
the default set of extensions. If no extensions have a + or
- prefix, only those extensions that are explicitly listed
will be enabled. Unknown extensions are ignored and a
warning is produced. By default, all supported extensions
are available, except for deprecated extensions or those
that are still under development.</p>

<p>For example -x &quot;+imapflags -enotify&quot; will
enable the deprecated imapflags extension along with all
extensions that are available by default, except for the
enotify extension.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS sieve-binary Specifies the Sieve binary file
that needs to be dumped.</p>

<p>out-file Specifies where the output must be written.
This argument is optional. If omitted, the output is written
to stdout.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS sieve-dump will exit with one of the
following values:</p>

<p>0 Delivery was successful. (EX_OK, EXIT_SUCCES)</p>

<p>1 Operation failed. This is returned for almost all
failures. (EXIT_FAILURE)</p>

<p>64 Invalid parameter given. (EX_USAGE)</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
Dovecot&rsquo;s main configuration file.</p>

<p>/usr/local/etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf Sieve
interpreter settings (included from Dovecot&rsquo;s main
config- uration file)</p>

<p>REPORTING BUGS Report bugs, including doveconf -n
output, to the Dovecot Mailing List
&lt;dovecot@dovecot.org&gt;. Information about reporting
