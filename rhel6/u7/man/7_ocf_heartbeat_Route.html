<p>OCF_HEARTBEAT_ROUTE(7) OCF resource agents
OCF_HEARTBEAT_ROUTE(7)</p>

<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_Route - Manages network routes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Route [start | stop | monitor | meta-data |
validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Enables and disables network routes.</p>

<p>Supports host and net routes, routes via a gateway
address, and routes using specific source addresses.</p>

<p>This resource agent is useful if a node&acute;s routing
table needs to be manipulated based on node role
assignment.</p>

<p>Consider the following example use case:</p>

<p>- One cluster node serves as an IPsec tunnel
endpoint.</p>

<p>- All other nodes use the IPsec tunnel to reach hosts in
a specific remote network.</p>

<p>Then, here is how you would implement this scheme making
use of the Route resource agent:</p>

<p>- Configure an ipsec LSB resource.</p>

<p>- Configure a cloned Route OCF resource.</p>

<p>- Create an order constraint to ensure that ipsec is
started before Route.</p>

<p>- Create a colocation constraint between the ipsec and
Route resources, to make sure no instance of your cloned
Route resource is started on the tunnel endpoint itself.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS destination The destination network
(or host) to be configured for the route. Specify the
netmask suffix in CIDR notation (e.g. &quot;/24&quot;). If
no suffix is given, a host route will be created. Specify
&quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot; or &quot;default&quot; if you want
this resource to set the system default route.</p>

<p>(unique, required, string, no default)</p>

<p>device The outgoing network device to use for this
route.</p>

<p>(unique, optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>gateway The gateway IP address to use for this
route.</p>

<p>(unique, optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>source The source IP address to be configured for the
route.</p>

<p>(unique, optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>table The routing table to be configured for the
route.</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 20. Suggested interval: 10.</p>

<p>reload Suggested minimum timeout: 20.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 20.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
Route resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive p_Route ocf:heartbeat:Route params
destination=string op monitor timeout=&quot;20&quot;
interval=&quot;10&quot; depth=&quot;0&quot;</p>
