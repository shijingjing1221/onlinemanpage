<p>XKIBITZ(1) XKIBITZ(1)</p>

<p>NAME xkibitz - allow multiple people to interact in an
xterm</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xkibitz [ xkibitz-args ] [ program
program-args... ]</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION xkibitz allows users in separate xterms to
share one shell (or any pro- gram that runs in an xterm).
Uses include:</p>

<p>&middot; A novice user can ask an expert user for help.
Using xkib- itz, the expert can see what the user is doing,
and offer advice or show how to do it right.</p>

<p>&middot; By running xkibitz and then starting a
full-screen editor, people may carry out a conversation,
retaining the ability to scroll backwards, save the entire
conversation, or even edit it while in progress.</p>

<p>&middot; People can team up on games, document editing,
or other cooperative tasks where each person has strengths
and weak- nesses that complement one another.</p>

<p>&middot; If you want to have a large number of people do
an on-line code walk-through, you can sit two in front of
each worksta- tion, and then connect them all together while
you everyone looks at code together in the editor.</p>

<p>USAGE To start xkibitz, one user (the master) runs
xkibitz with no arguments.</p>

<p>xkibitz starts a new shell (or another program, if given
on the command line). The user can interact normally with
the shell, or upon entering an escape (described when
xkibitz starts) can add users to the interac- tion.</p>

<p>To add users, enter &quot;+ display&quot; where display
is the X display name. If there is no &quot;:X.Y&quot; in
the display name, &quot;:0.0&quot; is assumed. The mas- ter
user must have permission to access each display. Each
display is assigned a tag - a small integer which can be
used to reference the display.</p>

<p>To show the current tags and displays, enter
&quot;=&quot;.</p>

<p>To drop a display, enter &quot;- tag&quot; where tag is
the displays tag accord- ing to the &quot;=&quot;
command.</p>

<p>To return to the shared shell, enter &quot;return&quot;.
Then the keystrokes of all users become the input of the
shell. Similarly, all users receive the output from the
shell.</p>

<p>To terminate xkibitz it suffices to terminate the shell
itself. For example, if any user types ^D (and the shell
accepts this to be EOF), the shell terminates followed by
xkibitz.</p>

<p>Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted.
However, in the escape dialogue the user talks directly to
the xkibitz interpreter. Any Expect(1) or Tcl(3) commands
may also be given. Also, job control may be used while in
the interpreter, to, for example, suspend or restart
xkibitz.</p>

<p>Various processes can produce various effects. For
example, you can emulate a multi-way write(1) session with
the command:</p>

<p>xkibitz sleep 1000000</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS xkibitz understands a few special arguments
which should appear before the program name (if given). Each
argument should be separated by whitespace. If the arguments
themselves takes arguments, these should also be separated
by whitespace.</p>

<p>-escape sets the escape character. The default escape
character is ^].</p>

<p>-display adds a display much like the &quot;+&quot;
command. Multiple -display flags can be given. For example,
to start up xkibitz with three addi- tional displays:</p>

<p>xkibitz -display mercury -display fox -display
dragon:1.0</p>

<p>CAVEATS Due to limitations in both X and UNIX, resize
propagation is weak.</p>

<p>When the master user resizes the xterm, all the other
xterms are logi- cally resized. Unfortunately, xkibitz
cannot force the physical xterm size to correspond with the
logical xterm sizes.</p>

<p>The other users are free to resize their xterm but their
sizes are not propagated. The master can check the logical
sizes with the &quot;=&quot; com- mand.</p>

<p>Deducing the window size is a non-portable operation.
The code is known to work for recent versions of SunOS, AIX,
Unicos, and HPUX. Send back mods if you add support for
anything else.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable SHELL is used to
determine and start a shell, if no other program is given on
the command line.</p>

<p>If the environment variable DISPLAY is defined, its
value is used for the display name of the xkibitz master
(the display with tag number 0). Otherwise this name remains
empty.</p>

<p>Additional arguments may be passed to new xterms through
the environ- ment variable XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS. For example,
to create xterms with a scrollbar and a green pointer
cursor:</p>

<p>XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS=&quot;-sb -ms green&quot; export
XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS</p>

<p>(this is for the Bourne shell - use whatever syntax is
appropriate for your favorite shell). Any option can be
given that is valid for the xterm command, with the
exception of -display, -geometry and -S as those are set by
xkibitz.</p>
