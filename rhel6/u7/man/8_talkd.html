<p>NAME talkd - remote user communication server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS talkd [-dp]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Talkd is the server that notifies a user
that someone else wants to ini- tiate a conversation. It
acts a repository of invitations, responding to requests by
clients wishing to rendezvous to hold a conversation. In
normal operation, a client, the caller, initiates a
rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the server of type
LOOK_UP (see protocols/talkd.h). This causes the server to
search its invitation tables to check if an invita- tion
currently exists for the caller (to speak to the callee
specified in the message). If the lookup fails, the caller
then sends an ANNOUNCE message causing the server to
broadcast an announcement on the callees login ports
requesting contact. When the callee responds, the local
server uses the recorded invitation to respond with the
appropriate ren- dezvous address and the caller and callee
client programs establish a stream connection through which
the conversation takes place.</p>

<p>OPTIONS [-d] Debug mode; writes copious logging and
debugging information to /var/log/talkd.log.</p>

<p>[-p] Packet logging mode; writes copies of malformed
packets to /var/log/talkd.packets. This is useful for
debugging interoperability problems.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO talk(1), write(1)</p>

<p>HISTORY The talkd command appeared in 4.3BSD.</p>
