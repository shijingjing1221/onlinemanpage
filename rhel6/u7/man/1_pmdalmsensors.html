<p>NAME pmdalmsensors - Linux hardware monitoring
performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/pmdalmsensors [-d
domain] [-l logfile] [-U username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdalmsensors is a Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics
describing the state of hardware using the lm-sensors on
compatible motherboards.</p>

<p>The lmsensors PMDA exports metrics that measure fan
speeds, core tem- peratures and voltage levels.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdalmsensors command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named lmsen- sors.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdalmsensors is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd . If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to the standard error
instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the lmsensors performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdalmsensors is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdalmsensors $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/help default
help text file for the lmsensors metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/Install installation script for the
pmdalmsensors agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdalmsensors agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lmsensors.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdalmsensors</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
