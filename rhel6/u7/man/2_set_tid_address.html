<p>SET_TID_ADDRESS(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SET_TID_ADDRESS(2)</p>

<p>NAME set_tid_address - set pointer to thread ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>long set_tid_address(int *tidptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The kernel keeps for each process two values
called set_child_tid and clear_child_tid that are NULL by
default.</p>

<p>set_child_tid If a process is started using clone(2)
with the CLONE_CHILD_SETTID flag, set_child_tid is set to
child_tidptr, the fifth argument of that system call.</p>

<p>When set_child_tid is set, the very first thing the new
process does is writing its PID at this address.</p>

<p>clear_child_tid If a process is started using clone(2)
with the CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID flag, clear_child_tid is set
to child_tidptr, the fifth argument of that system call.</p>

<p>The system call set_tid_address() sets the
clear_child_tid value for the calling process to tidptr.</p>

<p>When clear_child_tid is set, and the process exits, and
the process was sharing memory with other processes or
threads, then 0 is written at this address, and a
futex(child_tidptr, FUTEX_WAKE, 1, NULL, NULL, 0); call is
done. (That is, wake a single process waiting on this
futex.) Errors are ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE set_tid_address() always returns the PID of
the calling process.</p>

<p>ERRORS set_tid_address() always succeeds.</p>

<p>VERSIONS This call is present since Linux 2.5.48.
Details as given here are valid since Linux 2.5.49.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>
