<p>NAME pmdaapache - Apache2 web server performance metrics
domain agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache/pmdaapache [-d domain]
[-l logfile] [-U username] [-S server] [-P port] [-L
location]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaapache is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing
the state of an Apache web server.</p>

<p>The apache PMDA exports metrics that measure the request
rate, cumula- tive request sizes, uptime and various
connection states for active clients.</p>

<p>This information is obtained by performing a HTTP
request to the server status URL, which must be enabled in
the httpd.conf configuration file.</p>

<p>ExtendedStatus on &lt;Location /server-status&gt;
SetHandler server-status Order deny,allow Deny from all
Allow from localhost &lt;/Location&gt;</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdaapache command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named apache.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmdaapache is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable,
output is written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-S Query the Apache status information from the named
server rather than the local host.</p>

<p>-P Query the Apache status information from the given
port rather than the default (80).</p>

<p>-L Specify an alternative location for finding the
server-status page.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the apache performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdaapache is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdaapache $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache/help default help
text file for the apache metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache/Install installation script for the
pmdaapache agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdaapache agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/apache.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdaapache</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
