<p>OPTION USAGE Obsolete options:</p>

<p>[-filter n]</p>

<p>Options available only in older versions:</p>

<p>[-chroma wx wy rx ry gx gy bx by] [-phys x y unit]
[-time [yy]yy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtopng reads a PNM image as input and produces a PNG
image as output.</p>

<p>Color component values in PNG files are either eight or
sixteen bits wide, so pnmtopng will automatically scale
colors to have a maxval of 255 or 65535.</p>

<p>For a grayscale image, pnmtopng produces a PNG bit depth
1, 2, 4, 8 or 16. When the input image has a small maxval,
the output PNG image has a correspondingly small bit depth.
But in mapping the PNM maxval to the PNG maxval (which is by
definition the maximum value that can be represented in the
number of bits), a fair amount of distortion happens with
these low maxvals. For example, with a PNM maxval of 5 and a
PNG maxval of 7, the input sample 2 becomes the output
sample 3. The input brightness is 2/5 = .40, while the
output brightness is 3/7 = .43. Note that this is not a
problem if you view the maxval as a precision, because in .4
and .43 are identical within the precision implied by maxval
5. Indeed, if you convert this PNG back to a maxval 5 PGM,
the pixel s value will again be 2, exactly as it was
originally. But if you need precisely the same colors in the
output PNG as in the input PNM, make sure your input PNM has
a maxval which is a power of two minus one. If you cant do
that, then convert it with pamdepth to something with a
large maxval that is a power of two minus one (255 and 65535
are good choices) to minimize the error.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pnmtopng changed in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005)
to use the standard Netpbm command line syntax. Before that,
you could not use double hyphens to denote an option and
could not use an equal sign to separate an option name from
its value. And the options had to come before the non-option
program arguments.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the options -chroma, -phys, and -time were
replaced by -rgb, size, and -modtime, respectively. The only
difference, taking -phys/-size as an example, is that -phys
takes multiple program argu- ments as the option argument,
whereas -rgb takes a single program argu- ment which is
composed of multiple words. E.g. The old shell command</p>

<p>pnmtopng -phys 800 800 0 input.pnm &gt;output.png</p>

<p>is equivalent to the new shell command</p>

<p>pnmtopng -size 800 800 0 input.pnm &gt;output.png</p>

<p>If you re writing a program that needs to work with both
new and old pnmtopng, have it first try with the new syntax,
and if it fails with unrecognized option, fall back to the
old syntax.</p>

<p>-verbose Display the format of the output file.</p>

<p>-downscale Enables scaling of maxvalues of more then
65535 to 16 bit. Since this means loss of image data,
pnmtopng does not do it by default..TP -interlace Creates an
interlaced PNG file (Adam7).</p>

<p>-alpha=filename This specifies the transparency (alpha
channel) of the image. You supply the alpha channel as a
standard PGM alpha mask (see the
PGM(1)specification.pnmtopngdoesnot necessarily represents
the transparency information as an alpha channel in the PNG
for- mat. If it can represent the transparency information
through a palette, it will do so in order to make a smaller
PNG file. pnmtopng even sorts the palette so it can omit the
opaque colors from the transparency part of the palette and
save space for the palette.</p>

<p>-transparent=color pnmtopng marks the specified color as
transparent in the PNG image.</p>

<p>Specify the color (color) as described for the argument
of the ppm_parsecolor() library routine . E.g. red or
rgb:ff/00/0d. If the color you specify is not present in the
image, pnmtopng selects instead the color in the image that
is closest to the one you specify. Closeness is measured as
a cartesian distance between colors in RGB space. If
multiple colors are equidis- tant, pnmtopng chooses one of
them arbitrarily.</p>

<p>However, if you prefix your color specification with =,
e.g.</p>

<p>-transparent =red</p>

<p>only the exact color you specify will be transparent. If
that color does not appear in the image, there will be no
trans- parency. pnmtopng issues an information message when
this is the case.</p>

<p>-background=color Causes pnmtopng to create a background
color chunk in the PNG output which can be used for
subsequent alpha channel or trans- parent color conversions.
Specify color the same as for -trans- parent.</p>

<p>-palette=palettefile This option specifies a palette to
use in the PNG. It forces pnmtopng to create the paletted
(colormapped) variety of PNG -- if that isnt possible,
pnmtopng fails. If the palette you specify doesnt contain
exactly the colors in the image, pnm- topng fails. Since
pnmtopng will automatically generate a paletted PNG, with a
correct palette, when appropriate, the only reason you would
specify the -palette option is if you care in what order the
colors appear in the palette. The PNG palette has colors in
the same order as the palette you specify.</p>

<p>You specify the palette by naming a PPM file that has
one pixel for each color in the palette.</p>

<p>Alternatively, consider the case that have a palette and
you want to make sure your PNG contains only colors from the
palette, approximating if necessary. You dont care what
indexes the PNG uses internally for the colors (i.e. the
order of the PNG palette). In this case, you dont need
-palette. Pass the Netpbm input image and your palette PPM
through pnm- remap. Though you might think it would, using
-palette in this case wouldnt even save pnmtopng any
work.</p>

<p>-gamma=value Causes pnmtopng to create a gAMA chunk.
This information helps describe how the color values in the
PNG must be interpreted. Without the gAMA chunk, whatever
interprets the PNG must get this information separately (or
just assume something standard). If your input is a true PPM
or PGM image, you should specify -gamma=.45. But sometimes
people generate images which are ostensibly PPM except the
image uses a different gamma transfer function than the one
specified for PPM. A common case of this is when the image
is created by simple hardware that doesnt have digital
computational ability. Also, some simple programs that
generate images from scratch do it with a gamma transfer in
which the gamma value is 1.0.</p>

<p>-hist Use this parameter to create a chunk that
specifies the fre- quency (or histogram) of the colors in
the image.</p>

<p>-rgb=chroma_list This option specifies how red, green,
and blue component values of a pixel specify a particular
color, by telling the chromatic- ities of those 3 primary
illuminants and of white (i.e. full strength of all
three).</p>

<p>The chroma_list value is a blank-separated list of 8
floating point decimal numbers. The CIE-1931 X and Y
chromaticities (in that order) of each of white, red, green,
and blue, in that order.</p>

<p>This information goes into the PNGs cHRM chunk.</p>

<p>In a shell command, make sure you use quotation marks so
that the blanks in chroma_list dont make the shell see
multiple com- mand arguments.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).
Before that, the option -chroma does the same thing, but
with slightly different syntax.</p>

<p>-sizex y unit This option determines the aspect ratio of
the individual pixels of your image as well as the physical
resolution of it.</p>

<p>unit is either 0 or 1. When it is 1, the option
specifies the physical resolution of the image in pixels per
meter. For exam- ple, -size10000 15000 1 means that when
someone displays the image, he should make it so that 10,000
pixels horizontally occupy 1 meter and 15,000 pixels
vertically occupy one meter. And even if he doesn t take
this advice on the overall size of the displayed image, he
should at least make it so that each pixel displays as 1.5
times as high as wide.</p>

<p>When unit is 0, that means there is no advice on the
absolute physical resolution; just on the ratio of
horizontal to vertical physical resolution.</p>

<p>This information goes into the PNGs pHYS chunk.</p>

<p>When you dont specify -size, pnmtopng creates the image
with no pHYS chunk, which means square pixels of no absolute
resolution.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).
Before that, the option -phys does the same thing, but with
slightly different syntax.</p>

<p>-text=filename This option lets you include comments in
the text chunk of the PNG output. file is the name of a file
that contains your text comments.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a comment file: Title PNG file</p>

<p>Author Bryan Henderson</p>

<p>Description how to include a text chunk PNG file
&quot;Creation date&quot; 3-feb-1987</p>

<p>Software pnmtopng</p>

<p>The format of the file is as follows: The file is
divided into lines, delimited by newline characters. The
last line need not end with a newline character. A group of
consecutive lines rep- resents a comment.</p>

<p>A &quot;delimiter character&quot; is a blank or tab or
null character. The first line representing a comment must
not start with a delimiter character. Every other line in
the group is a &quot;con- tinuation line&quot; and must
start with a delimiter character.</p>

<p>The first line representing a comment consists of a
keyword and the first line of comment text. The keyword
begins in Column 1 of the file line and continues up to, but
not including, the first delimiter character, or the end of
the line, whichever is first. Exception: you can enclose the
keyword in double quotes and spaces and tabs within the
double quotes are part of the keyword. The quotes are not
part of the keyword. A NUL charac- ter is not allowed in a
keyword.</p>

<p>The first line of the comment text is all the text in
the file line beginning after the keyword and any delimiter
characters after it. immediately after the delimiter
character that marks the end of the keyword.</p>

<p>A continuation line defines a subsequent line of the
comment. The comment line is all the text on the
continuation line start- ing with the first non-delimiter
character.</p>

<p>There is one newline character between every two comment
lines. There is no newline character after the last line of
comment text.</p>

<p>There is no limit on the length of a file line or
keyword or comment text line or comment text. There is no
limit on the number of comments or size of or number of
lines in the file.</p>

<p>-ztxt=filename The same as -text, except pnmtopng
considers the text com- pressed.</p>

<p>-modtime[yy]yy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss This option allows you to
specify the modification time value to be placed in the PNG
output. You can specify the year parameter either as a two
digit or four digit value.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).
Before that, the option -time does the same thing, but with
slightly different syntax.</p>

<p>-filter=n This option is obsolete. Before Netpbm 10.22
(April 2004), this was the only way to specify a row filter.
It specifies a single type of row filter, by number, that
pnmtopng must use on each row.</p>

<p>Use -nofilter, -sub, -up, -avg, and -paeth in current
Netpbm.</p>

<p>-nofilter</p>

<p>-sub</p>

<p>-up</p>

<p>-avg</p>

<p>-paeth Each of these options permits pnmtopng to use one
type of row filter. pnmtopng chooses whichever of the
permitted filters it finds to be optimal. If you specify
none of these options, it is the same as specifying all of
them -- pnmtopng uses any row filter type it finds
optimal.</p>

<p>These options were new with Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004).
Before that, you could use the -filter option to specify one
permitted row filter type. The default, when you specify no
filter options, was the same.</p>

<p>-compression=n This option sets set the compression
level of the zlib compres- sion. Select a level from 0 for
no compression (maximum speed) to 9 for maximum compression
(minimum speed).</p>

<p>-comp_mem_level=n This option sets the memory usage
level of the zlib compression. Select a level from 1 for
minimum memory usage (and minimum speed) to 9 for maximum
memory usage (and speed).</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p>-comp_strategy={huffman_only|filtered} This options sets
the compression strategy of the zlib compres- sion. See Zlib
documentation for information on what these strategies
are.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p>-comp_method=deflated This option does nothing. It is
here for mathematical complete- ness and for possible
forward compatibility. It theoretically selects the
compression method of the zlib compression, but the Z
library knows only one method today, so theres nothing to
choose.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p>-comp_window_bits=N This option tells how big a window
the zlib compression algo- rithm uses. The value is the base
2 logarithm of the window size in bytes, so 8 means 256
bytes. The value must be from 8 to 15 (i.e. 256 bytes to
32K).</p>

<p>See Zlib documentation for details on what this window
size is.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p>-comp_buffer_size=N This option determines in what size
pieces pnmtopng does the zlib compression. One compressed
piece goes in each IDAT chunk in the PNG. So the bigger this
value, the fewer IDAT chunks your PNG will have.
Theoretically, this makes the PNG smaller because 1) you
have less per-IDAT-chunk overhead, and 2) the compression
algorithm has more data to work with. But in real- ity, the
difference will probably not be noticeable above about 8K,
which is the default.</p>

<p>The value n is the size of the compressed piece (i.e.
the com- pression buffer) in bytes.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p>-force When you specify this, pnmtopng limits its
optimizations. The resulting PNG output is as similar to the
Netpbm input as possi- ble. For example, the PNG output will
not be paletted and the alpha channel will be represented as
a full alpha channel even if the information could be
represented more succinctly with a transparency chunk.</p>

<p>-libversion This option causes pnmtopng to display
version information about itself and the libraries it uses,
in addition to all its normal function. Do not confuse this
with the Netpbm common option -version, which causes the
program to display version informa- tion about the Netpbm
library and do nothing else.</p>

<p>You can t really use this option in a program that
invokes pnm- topng and needs to know which version it is.
Its function has changed too much over the history of
pnmtopng. The option is only good for human eyes.</p>
