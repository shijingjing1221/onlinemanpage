<p>NAME pax - portable archive interchange</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pax [-cdnv][-H|-L][-f archive][-s
replstr]...[pattern...]</p>

<p>pax -r[-cdiknuv][-H|-L][-f archive][-o options]...[-p
string]... [-s replstr]...[pattern...]</p>

<p>pax -w[-dituvX][-H|-L][-b blocksize][[-a][-f archive][-o
options]... [-s replstr]...[-x format][file...]</p>

<p>pax -r -w[-diklntuvX][-H|-L][-p string]...[-s
replstr]... [file...] directory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pax utility shall read, write, and write
lists of the members of archive files and copy directory
hierarchies. A variety of archive for- mats shall be
supported; see the -x format option.</p>

<p>The action to be taken depends on the presence of the -r
and -w options. The four combinations of -r and -w are
referred to as the four modes of operation: list, read,
write, and copy modes, corresponding respectively to the
four forms shown in the SYNOPSIS section.</p>

<p>list In list mode (when neither -r nor -w are
specified), pax shall write the names of the members of the
archive file read from the standard input, with pathnames
matching the specified patterns, to standard output. If a
named file is of type directory, the file hierarchy rooted
at that file shall be listed as well.</p>

<p>read In read mode (when -r is specified, but -w is not),
pax shall extract the members of the archive file read from
the standard input, with pathnames matching the specified
patterns. If an extracted file is of type directory, the
file hierarchy rooted at that file shall be extracted as
well. The extracted files shall be created performing
pathname resolution with the direc- tory in which pax was
invoked as the current working directory.</p>

<p>If an attempt is made to extract a directory when the
directory already exists, this shall not be considered an
error. If an attempt is made to extract a FIFO when the FIFO
already exists, this shall not be consid- ered an error.</p>

<p>The ownership, access, and modification times, and file
mode of the restored files are discussed under the -p
option.</p>

<p>write In write mode (when -w is specified, but -r is
not), pax shall write the contents of the file operands to
the standard output in an archive format. If no file
operands are specified, a list of files to copy, one per
line, shall be read from the standard input. A file of type
directory shall include all of the files in the file
hierarchy rooted at the file.</p>

<p>copy In copy mode (when both -r and -w are specified),
pax shall copy the file operands to the destination
directory.</p>

<p>If no file operands are specified, a list of files to
copy, one per line, shall be read from the standard input. A
file of type directory shall include all of the files in the
file hierarchy rooted at the file.</p>

<p>The effect of the copy shall be as if the copied files
were written to an archive file and then subsequently
extracted, except that there may be hard links between the
original and the copied files. If the desti- nation
directory is a subdirectory of one of the files to be
copied, the results are unspecified. If the destination
directory is a file of a type not defined by the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the results are
implementation-defined; other- wise, it shall be an error
for the file named by the directory operand not to exist,
not be writable by the user, or not be a file of type
directory.</p>

<p>In read or copy modes, if intermediate directories are
necessary to extract an archive member, pax shall perform
actions equivalent to the mkdir() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, called
with the following arguments:</p>

<p>* The intermediate directory used as the path
argument</p>

<p>* The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRWXU,
S_IRWXG, and S_IRWXO as the mode argument</p>

<p>If any specified pattern or file operands are not
matched by at least one file or archive member, pax shall
write a diagnostic message to standard error for each one
that did not match and exit with a non-zero exit status.</p>

<p>The archive formats described in the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION section shall be automatically detected on
input. The default output archive format shall be
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>A single archive can span multiple files. The pax
utility shall deter- mine, in an implementation-defined
manner, what file to read or write as the next file.</p>

<p>If the selected archive format supports the
specification of linked files, it shall be an error if these
files cannot be linked when the archive is extracted. For
archive formats that do not store file con- tents with each
name that causes a hard link, if the file that contains the
data is not extracted during this pax session, either the
data shall be restored from the original file, or a
diagnostic message shall be displayed with the name of a
file that can be used to extract the data. In traversing
directories, pax shall detect infinite loops; that is,
entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor
of the last file visited. When it detects an infinite loop,
pax shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and
shall terminate.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The pax utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that the order of
presentation of the -o, -p, and -s options is signif-
icant.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-r Read an archive file from standard input.</p>

<p>-w Write files to the standard output in the specified
archive for- mat.</p>

<p>-a Append files to the end of the archive. It is
implementation- defined which devices on the system support
appending. Addi- tional file formats unspecified by this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 may impose restrictions on
appending.</p>

<p>-b blocksize Block the output at a positive decimal
integer number of bytes per write to the archive file.
Devices and archive formats may impose restrictions on
blocking. Blocking shall be automatically determined on
input. Conforming applications shall not specify a blocksize
value larger than 32256. Default blocking when creat- ing
archives depends on the archive format. (See the -x option
below.)</p>

<p>-c Match all file or archive members except those
specified by the pattern or file operands.</p>

<p>-d Cause files of type directory being copied or
archived or archive members of type directory being
extracted or listed to match only the file or archive member
itself and not the file hierarchy rooted at the file.</p>

<p>-f archive Specify the pathname of the input or output
archive, overriding the default standard input (in list or
read modes) or standard output ( write mode).</p>

<p>-H If a symbolic link referencing a file of type
directory is spec- ified on the command line, pax shall
archive the file hierarchy rooted in the file referenced by
the link, using the name of the link as the root of the file
hierarchy. Otherwise, if a symbolic link referencing a file
of any other file type which pax can normally archive is
specified on the command line, then pax shall archive the
file referenced by the link, using the name of the link. The
default behavior shall be to archive the symbolic link
itself.</p>

<p>-i Interactively rename files or archive members. For
each archive member matching a pattern operand or file
matching a file operand, a prompt shall be written to the
file /dev/tty. The prompt shall contain the name of the file
or archive member, but the format is otherwise unspecified.
A line shall then be read from /dev/tty. If this line is
blank, the file or archive member shall be skipped. If this
line consists of a single period, the file or archive member
shall be processed with no modification to its name.
Otherwise, its name shall be replaced with the con- tents of
the line. The pax utility shall immediately exit with a
non-zero exit status if end-of-file is encountered when
reading a response or if /dev/tty cannot be opened for
reading and writ- ing.</p>

<p>The results of extracting a hard link to a file that has
been renamed during extraction are unspecified.</p>

<p>-k Prevent the overwriting of existing files.</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) In copy mode, hard links shall be
made between the source and destination file hierarchies
whenever possible. If specified in conjunction with -H or
-L, when a symbolic link is encountered, the hard link
created in the destination file hierarchy shall be to the
file referenced by the symbolic link. If specified when
neither -H nor -L is specified, when a sym- bolic link is
encountered, the implementation shall create a hard link to
the symbolic link in the source file hierarchy or copy the
symbolic link to the destination.</p>

<p>-L If a symbolic link referencing a file of type
directory is spec- ified on the command line or encountered
during the traversal of a file hierarchy, pax shall archive
the file hierarchy rooted in the file referenced by the
link, using the name of the link as the root of the file
hierarchy. Otherwise, if a symbolic link referencing a file
of any other file type which pax can normally archive is
specified on the command line or encountered during the
traversal of a file hierarchy, pax shall archive the file
referenced by the link, using the name of the link. The
default behavior shall be to archive the symbolic link
itself.</p>

<p>-n Select the first archive member that matches each
pattern operand. No more than one archive member shall be
matched for each pattern (although members of type directory
shall still match the file hierarchy rooted at that
file).</p>

<p>-o options Provide information to the implementation to
modify the algo- rithm for extracting or writing files. The
value of options shall consist of one or more
comma-separated keywords of the form:</p>

<p>keyword[[:]=value][,keyword[[:]=value], ...]</p>

<p>Some keywords apply only to certain file formats, as
indicated with each description. Use of keywords that are
inapplicable to the file format being processed produces
undefined results.</p>

<p>Keywords in the options argument shall be a string that
would be a valid portable filename as described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.276,
Portable Filename Character Set.</p>

<p>Note: Keywords are not expected to be filenames, merely
to follow the same character composition rules as portable
filenames.</p>

<p>Keywords can be preceded with white space. The value
field shall con- sist of zero or more characters; within
value, the application shall precede any literal comma with
a backslash, which shall be ignored, but preserves the comma
as part of value. A comma as the final character, or a comma
followed solely by white space as the final characters, in
options shall be ignored. Multiple -o options can be
specified; if key- words given to these multiple -o options
conflict, the keywords and values appearing later in command
line sequence shall take precedence and the earlier shall be
silently ignored. The following keyword values of options
shall be supported for the file formats as indicated:</p>

<p>delete=pattern</p>

<p>(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) When used in
write or copy mode, pax shall omit from extended header
records that it produces any keywords matching the string
pattern. When used in read or list mode, pax shall ignore
any keywords matching the string pattern in the extended
header records. In both cases, matching shall be performed
using the pattern matching notation described in Patterns
Matching a Single Character and Patterns Matching Multiple
Characters . For example:</p>

<p>-o delete=security.*</p>

<p>would suppress security-related information. See pax
Extended Header for extended header record keyword
usage.</p>

<p>exthdr.name=string</p>

<p>(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) This keyword
allows user control over the name that is written into the
ustar header blocks for the extended header produced under
the circumstances described in pax Header Block . The name
shall be the contents of string, after the following
character substitutions have been made:</p>

<p>string Includes: Replaced By: %d The directory name of
the file, equiva- lent to the result of the dirname util-
ity on the translated pathname. %f The filename of the file,
equivalent to the result of the basename utility on the
translated pathname. %p The process ID of the pax process.
%% A%character.</p>

<p>Any other %characters in string produce undefined
results.</p>

<p>If no -o exthdr.name= string is specified, pax shall use
the following default value:</p>

<p>%d/PaxHeaders.%p/%f</p>

<p>globexthdr.name=string</p>

<p>(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) When used in
write or copy mode with the appropriate options, pax shall
create global extended header records with ustar header
blocks that will be treated as regular files by previous
versions of pax. This key- word allows user control over the
name that is written into the ustar header blocks for global
extended header records. The name shall be the contents of
string, after the following character substitutions have
been made:</p>

<p>string Includes: Replaced By: %n An integer that
represents the sequence number of the global extended header
record in the archive, starting at 1. %p The process ID of
the pax process. %% A%character.</p>

<p>Any other%characters in string produce undefined
results.</p>

<p>If no -o globexthdr.name= string is specified, pax shall
use the following default value:</p>

<p>$TMPDIR/GlobalHead.%p.%n</p>

<p>where $ TMPDIR represents the value of the TMPDIR
environment variable. If TMPDIR is not set, pax shall use
/tmp.</p>

<p>invalid=action</p>

<p>(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) This keyword
allows user control over the action pax takes upon
encountering values in an extended header record that, in
read or copy mode, are invalid in the destination hierarchy
or, in list mode, cannot be written in the codeset and
current locale of the implementation. The following are
invalid values that shall be recognized by pax:</p>

<p>* In read or copy mode, a filename or link name that
contains character encodings invalid in the destina- tion
hierarchy. (For example, the name may contain embedded
NULs.)</p>

<p>* In read or copy mode, a filename or link name that is
longer than the maximum allowed in the destination hierarchy
(for either a pathname component or the entire
pathname).</p>

<p>* In list mode, any character string value (filename,
link name, user name, and so on) that cannot be writ- ten in
the codeset and current locale of the implemen- tation.</p>

<p>The following mutually-exclusive values of the action
argument are supported:</p>

<p>bypass In read or copy mode, pax shall bypass the file,
causing no change to the destination hierarchy. In list
mode, pax shall write all requested valid values for the
file, but its method for writing invalid values is
unspecified.</p>

<p>rename In read or copy mode, pax shall act as if the -i
option were in effect for each file with invalid filename or
link name values, allowing the user to provide a replace-
ment name interactively. In list mode, pax shall behave
identically to the bypass action.</p>

<p>UTF-8 When used in read, copy, or list mode and a
filename, link name, owner name, or any other field in an
extended header record cannot be translated from the pax
UTF-8 codeset format to the codeset and current locale of
the implementation, pax shall use the actual UTF-8 encoding
for the name.</p>

<p>write In read or copy mode, pax shall write the file,
translat- ing or truncating the name, regardless of whether
this may overwrite an existing file with a valid name. In
list mode, pax shall behave identically to the bypass
action.</p>

<p>If no -o invalid= option is specified, pax shall act as
if -o invalid= bypass were specified. Any overwriting of
existing files that may be allowed by the -o invalid=
actions shall be subject to permission ( -p) and
modification time ( -u) restric- tions, and shall be
suppressed if the -k option is also speci- fied.</p>

<p>linkdata</p>

<p>(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) In write mode,
pax shall write the contents of a file to the archive even
when that file is merely a hard link to a file whose
contents have already been written to the archive.</p>

<p>listopt=format</p>

<p>This keyword specifies the output format of the table of
con- tents produced when the -v option is specified in list
mode. See List Mode Format Specifications . To avoid
ambiguity, the listopt= format shall be the only or final
keyword= value pair in a -o option-argument; all characters
in the remainder of the option-argument shall be considered
part of the format string. When multiple -o listopt= format
options are specified, the for- mat strings shall be
considered a single, concatenated string, evaluated in
command line order.</p>

<p>times</p>

<p>(Applicable only to the -x pax format.) When used in
write or copy mode, pax shall include atime, ctime, and
mtime extended header records for each file. See pax
Extended Header File Times .</p>

<p>In addition to these keywords, if the -x pax format is
specified, any of the keywords and values defined in pax
Extended Header, including implementation extensions, can be
used in -o option-arguments, in either of two modes:</p>

<p>keyword=value</p>

<p>When used in write or copy mode, these keyword/value
pairs shall be included at the beginning of the archive as
typeflag g global extended header records. When used in read
or list mode, these keyword/value pairs shall act as if they
had been at the begin- ning of the archive as typeflag g
global extended header records.</p>

<p>keyword:=value</p>

<p>When used in write or copy mode, these keyword/value
pairs shall be included as records at the beginning of a
typeflag x extended header for each file. (This shall be
equivalent to the equal- sign form except that it creates no
typeflag g global extended header records.) When used in
read or list mode, these key- word/value pairs shall act as
if they were included as records at the end of each extended
header; thus, they shall override any global or
file-specific extended header record keywords of the same
names. For example, in the command:</p>

<p>pax -r -o &quot; gname:=mygroup, &quot; &lt;archive</p>

<p>the group name will be forced to a new value for all
files read from the archive.</p>

<p>The precedence of -o keywords over various fields in the
archive is described in pax Extended Header Keyword
Precedence .</p>

<p>-p string Specify one or more file characteristic
options (privileges). The string option-argument shall be a
string specifying file characteristics to be retained or
discarded on extraction. The string shall consist of the
specification characters a, e, m, o, and p . Other
implementation-defined characters can be included. Multiple
characteristics can be concatenated within the same string
and multiple -p options can be specified. The meaning of the
specification characters are as follows:</p>

<p>a Do not preserve file access times.</p>

<p>e Preserve the user ID, group ID, file mode bits (see
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
3.168, File Mode Bits), access time, modification time, and
any other imple- mentation-defined file characteristics.</p>

<p>m Do not preserve file modification times.</p>

<p>o Preserve the user ID and group ID.</p>

<p>p Preserve the file mode bits. Other
implementation-defined file mode attributes may be
preserved.</p>

<p>In the preceding list, &quot;preserve&quot; indicates
that an attribute stored in the archive shall be given to
the extracted file, subject to the per- missions of the
invoking process. The access and modification times of the
file shall be preserved unless otherwise specified with the
-p option or not stored in the archive. All attributes that
are not pre- served shall be determined as part of the
normal file creation action (see File Read, Write, and
Creation ).</p>

<p>If neither the e nor the o specification character is
specified, or the user ID and group ID are not preserved for
any reason, pax shall not set the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits
of the file mode.</p>

<p>If the preservation of any of these items fails for any
reason, pax shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error. Failure to pre- serve these items shall affect the
final exit status, but shall not cause the extracted file to
be deleted.</p>

<p>If file characteristic letters in any of the string
option-arguments are duplicated or conflict with each other,
the ones given last shall take precedence. For example, if
-p eme is specified, file modification times are
preserved.</p>

<p>-s replstr Modify file or archive member names named by
pattern or file operands according to the substitution
expression replstr, using the syntax of the ed utility. The
concepts of &quot;address&quot; and &quot;line&quot; are
meaningless in the context of the pax utility, and shall not
be supplied. The format shall be:</p>

<p>-s /old/new/[gp]</p>

<p>where as in ed, old is a basic regular expression and
new can contain an ampersand,n(where n is a digit)
backreferences, or subexpres- sion matching. The old string
shall also be permitted to contain &lt;new- line&gt;s.</p>

<p>Any non-null character can be used as a delimiter ( /
shown here). Multiple -s expressions can be specified; the
expressions shall be applied in the order specified,
terminating with the first successful substitution. The
optional trailinggis as defined in the ed util- ity. The
optional trailing p shall cause successful substitutions to
be written to standard error. File or archive member names
that substi- tute to the empty string shall be ignored when
reading and writing archives.</p>

<p>-t When reading files from the file system, and if the
user has the permissions required by utime() to do so, set
the access time of each file read to the access time that it
had before being read by pax.</p>

<p>-u Ignore files that are older (having a less recent
file modifica- tion time) than a pre-existing file or
archive member with the same name. In read mode, an archive
member with the same name as a file in the file system shall
be extracted if the archive mem- ber is newer than the file.
In write mode, an archive file mem- ber with the same name
as a file in the file system shall be superseded if the file
is newer than the archive member. If -a is also specified,
this is accomplished by appending to the archive; otherwise,
it is unspecified whether this is accom- plished by actual
replacement in the archive or by appending to the archive.
In copy mode, the file in the destination hierarchy shall be
replaced by the file in the source hierarchy or by a link to
the file in the source hierarchy if the file in the source
hierarchy is newer.</p>

<p>-v In list mode, produce a verbose table of contents
(see the STD- OUT section). Otherwise, write archive member
pathnames to stan- dard error (see the STDERR section).</p>

<p>-x format Specify the output archive format. The pax
utility shall support the following formats:</p>

<p>cpio The cpio interchange format; see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION sec- tion. The default blocksize for this format
for character spe- cial archive files shall be 5120.
Implementations shall support all blocksize values less than
or equal to 32256 that are multi- ples of 512.</p>

<p>pax The pax interchange format; see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION sec- tion. The default blocksize for this format
for character spe- cial archive files shall be 5120.
Implementations shall support all blocksize values less than
or equal to 32256 that are multi- ples of 512.</p>

<p>ustar The tar interchange format; see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION sec- tion. The default blocksize for this format
for character spe- cial archive files shall be 10240.
Implementations shall support all blocksize values less than
or equal to 32256 that are multi- ples of 512.</p>

<p>Implementation-defined formats shall specify a default
block size as well as any other block sizes supported for
character special archive files.</p>

<p>Any attempt to append to an archive file in a format
different from the existing archive format shall cause pax
to exit immediately with a non- zero exit status.</p>

<p>In copy mode, if no -x format is specified, pax shall
behave as if -x pax were specified.</p>

<p>-X When traversing the file hierarchy specified by a
pathname, pax shall not descend into directories that have a
different device ID ( st_dev; see the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, stat()).</p>

<p>The options that operate on the names of files or
archive members ( -c, -i, -n, -s, -u, and -v) shall interact
as follows. In read mode, the archive members shall be
selected based on the user-specified pattern operands as
modified by the -c, -n, and -u options. Then, any -s and -i
options shall modify, in that order, the names of the
selected files. The -v option shall write names resulting
from these modifications.</p>

<p>In write mode, the files shall be selected based on the
user-specified pathnames as modified by the -n and -u
options. Then, any -s and -i options shall modify, in that
order, the names of these selected files. The -v option
shall write names resulting from these modifications.</p>

<p>If both the -u and -n options are specified, pax shall
not consider a file selected unless it is newer than the
file to which it is compared.</p>

<p>List Mode Format Specifications In list mode with the -o
listopt= format option, the format argument shall be applied
for each selected file. The pax utility shall append a
&lt;newline&gt; to the listopt output for each selected
file. The format argument shall be used as the format string
described in the Base Defi- nitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Chapter 5, File Format Nota- tion, with the
exceptions 1. through 5. defined in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section of printf, plus the following exceptions:</p>

<p>6. The sequence ( keyword) can occur before a format
conversion specifier. The conversion argument is defined by
the value of keyword. The implementation shall support the
following key- words:</p>

<p>* Any of the Field Name entries in ustar Header Block
and Octet-Oriented cpio Archive Entry . The implementation
may support the cpio keywords without the leading c_ in
addition to the form required by Values for cpio c_mode
Field .</p>

<p>* Any keyword defined for the extended header in pax
Extended Header .</p>

<p>* Any keyword provided as an implementation-defined
extension within the extended header defined in pax Extended
Header .</p>

<p>For example, the sequence &quot;%(charset)s&quot; is the
string value of the name of the character set in the
extended header.</p>

<p>The result of the keyword conversion argument shall be
the value from the applicable header field or extended
header, without any trailing NULs.</p>

<p>All keyword values used as conversion arguments shall be
translated from the UTF-8 encoding to the character set
appropriate for the local file system, user database, and so
on, as applicable.</p>

<p>7. An additional conversion specifier character, T,
shall be used to specify time formats. The T conversion
specifier character can be preceded by the sequence (
keyword= subformat), where subformat is a date format as
defined by date operands. The default keyword shall be mtime
and the default subformat shall be:</p>

<p>%b %e %H:%M %Y</p>

<p>8. An additional conversion specifier character, M,
shall be used to specify the file mode string as defined in
ls Standard Out- put. If ( keyword) is omitted, the mode
keyword shall be used. For example, %.1M writes the single
character corresponding to the &lt;entry type&gt; field of
the ls -l command.</p>

<p>9. An additional conversion specifier character, D,
shall be used to specify the device for block or special
files, if applicable, in an implementation-defined format.
If not applicable, and ( keyword) is specified, then this
conversion shall be equivalent to %(keyword)u. If not
applicable, and ( keyword) is omitted, then this conversion
shall be equivalent to &lt;space&gt;.</p>

<p>10. An additional conversion specifier character, F,
shall be used to specify a pathname. The F conversion
character can be pre- ceded by a sequence of comma-separated
keywords:</p>

<p>(keyword[,keyword] ... )</p>

<p>The values for all the keywords that are non-null shall
be concatenated together, each separated by a/. The default
shall be ( path) if the keyword path is defined; otherwise,
the default shall be ( prefix, name).</p>

<p>11. An additional conversion specifier character, L,
shall be used to specify a symbolic line expansion. If the
current file is a symbolic link, then %L shall expand
to:</p>

<p>&quot;%s -&gt; %s&quot;, &lt;value of keyword&gt;,
&lt;contents of link&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, the %L conversion specification shall be the
equivalent of %F .</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>directory The destination directory pathname for copy
mode.</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be copied or archived.</p>

<p>pattern A pattern matching one or more pathnames of
archive members. A pattern must be given in the
name-generating notation of the pattern matching notation in
Pattern Matching Notation, includ- ing the filename
expansion rules in Patterns Used for Filename Expansion .
The default, if no pattern is specified, is to select all
members in the archive.</p>

<p>STDIN In write mode, the standard input shall be used
only if no file operands are specified. It shall be a text
file containing a list of pathnames, one per line, without
leading or trailing &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>In list and read modes, if -f is not specified, the
standard input shall be an archive file.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file named by the archive
option-argument, or standard input when the archive is read
from there, shall be a file formatted accord- ing to one of
the specifications in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section or
some other implementation-defined format.</p>

<p>The file /dev/tty shall be used to write prompts and
read responses.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of pax:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
used in the pat- tern matching expressions for the pattern
operand, the basic regular expression for the -s option, and
the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MES- SAGES category.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files), the behavior of character classes used in
the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MES- SAGES category, and pattern
matching.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale for the processing of
affirmative responses that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diag- nostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p>LC_TIME Determine the format and contents of date and
time strings when the -v option is specified.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TMPDIR Determine the pathname that provides part of the
default global extended header record file, as described for
the -o globexthdr= keyword in the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p>TZ Determine the timezone used to calculate date and
time strings when the -v option is specified. If TZ is unset
or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT In write mode, if -f is not specified, the
standard output shall be the archive formatted according to
one of the specifications in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section, or some other implementation-defined for- mat (see
-x format).</p>

<p>In list mode, when the -o listopt= format has been
specified, the selected archive members shall be written to
standard output using the format described under List Mode
Format Specifications . In list mode without the -o listopt=
format option, the table of contents of the selected archive
members shall be written to standard output using the
following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p>If the -v option is specified in list mode, the table of
contents of the selected archive members shall be written to
standard output using the following formats.</p>

<p>For pathnames representing hard links to previous
members of the archive:</p>

<p>&quot;%s == %n&quot;, &lt;ls -l listing&gt;,
&lt;linkname&gt;</p>

<p>For all other pathnames:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;ls -l listing&gt;</p>

<p>where &lt;ls -l listing&gt; shall be the format
specified by the ls utility with the -l option. When writing
pathnames in this format, it is unspecified what is written
for fields for which the underlying archive format does not
have the correct information, although the correct num- ber
of &lt;blank&gt;-separated fields shall be written.</p>

<p>In list mode, standard output shall not be buffered more
than a line at a time.</p>

<p>STDERR If -v is specified in read, write, or copy modes,
pax shall write the pathnames it processes to the standard
error output using the following format:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;pathname&gt;</p>

<p>These pathnames shall be written as soon as processing
is begun on the file or archive member, and shall be flushed
to standard error. The trailing &lt;newline&gt;, which shall
not be buffered, is written when the file has been read or
written.</p>

<p>If the -s option is specified, and the replacement
string has a trail- ing, substitutions shall be written to
standard error in the fol- lowing format:</p>

<p>&quot;%s &gt;&gt; %n&quot;, &lt;original pathname&gt;,
&lt;new pathname&gt;</p>

<p>In all operating modes of pax, optional messages of
unspecified format concerning the input archive format and
volume number, the number of files, blocks, volumes, and
media parts as well as other diagnostic messages may be
written to standard error.</p>

<p>In all formats, for both standard output and standard
error, it is unspecified how non-printable characters in
pathnames or link names are written.</p>

<p>When pax is in read mode or list mode, using the -x pax
archive format, and a filename, link name, owner name, or
any other field in an extended header record cannot be
translated from the pax UTF-8 codeset format to the codeset
and current locale of the implementation, pax shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error, shall process the file
as described for the -o invalid= option, and then shall
process the next file in the archive.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES In read mode, the extracted output files
shall be of the archived file type. In copy mode, the copied
output files shall be the type of the file being copied. In
either mode, existing files in the destination hierarchy
shall be overwritten only when all permission ( -p), modifi-
cation time ( -u), and invalid-value ( -o invalid=) tests
allow it.</p>

<p>In write mode, the output file named by the -f
option-argument shall be a file formatted according to one
of the specifications in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section,
or some other implementation-defined format.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION pax Interchange Format A pax
archive tape or file produced in the -x pax format shall
contain a series of blocks. The physical layout of the
archive shall be identi- cal to the ustar format described
in ustar Interchange Format . Each file archived shall be
represented by the following sequence:</p>

<p>* An optional header block with extended header records.
This header block is of the form described in pax Header
Block, with a typeflag value of x or g. The extended header
records, described in pax Extended Header, shall be included
as the data for this header block.</p>

<p>* A header block that describes the file. Any fields in
the preceding optional extended header shall override the
associated fields in this header block for this file.</p>

<p>* Zero or more blocks that contain the contents of the
file.</p>

<p>At the end of the archive file there shall be two
512-byte blocks filled with binary zeros, interpreted as an
end-of-archive indicator.</p>

<p>A schematic of an example archive with global extended
header records and two actual files is shown in pax Format
Archive Example . In the example, the second file in the
archive has no extended header preceding it, presumably
because it has no need for extended attributes.</p>

<p>Figure: pax Format Archive Example</p>

<p>pax Header Block The pax header block shall be identical
to the ustar header block described in ustar Interchange
Format, except that two additional type- flag values are
defined:</p>

<p>x Represents extended header records for the following
file in the archive (which shall have its own ustar header
block). The for- mat of these extended header records shall
be as described in pax Extended Header .</p>

<p>g Represents global extended header records for the
following files in the archive. The format of these extended
header records shall be as described in pax Extended Header
. Each value shall affect all subsequent files that do not
override that value in their own extended header record and
until another global extended header record is reached that
provides another value for the same field. The typeflag g
global headers should not be used with interchange media
that could suffer partial data loss in transporting the
archive.</p>

<p>For both of these types, the size field shall be the
size of the extended header records in octets. The other
fields in the header block are not meaningful to this
version of the pax utility. However, if this archive is read
by a pax utility conforming to the ISO POSIX-2:1993
standard, the header block fields are used to create a
regular file that contains the extended header records as
data. Therefore, header block field values should be
selected to provide reasonable file access to this regular
file.</p>

<p>A further difference from the ustar header block is that
data blocks for files of typeflag 1 (the digit one) (hard
link) may be included, which means that the size field may
be greater than zero. Archives cre- ated by pax -o linkdata
shall include these data blocks with the hard links.</p>

<p>pax Extended Header A pax extended header contains
values that are inappropriate for the ustar header block
because of limitations in that format: fields requiring a
character encoding other than that described in the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard, fields representing file attributes not
described in the ustar header, and fields whose format or
length do not fit the requirements of the ustar header. The
values in an extended header add attributes to the following
file (or files; see the descrip- tion of the typeflag g
header block) or override values in the follow- ing header
block(s), as indicated in the following list of
keywords.</p>

<p>An extended header shall consist of one or more records,
each con- structed as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;%d %s=%n&quot;, &lt;length&gt;, &lt;keyword&gt;,
&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>The extended header records shall be encoded according
to the ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard (UTF-8). The
&lt;length&gt; field, &lt;blank&gt;, equals sign, and
&lt;newline&gt; shown shall be limited to the portable char-
acter set, as encoded in UTF-8. The &lt;keyword&gt; and
&lt;value&gt; fields can be any UTF-8 characters. The
&lt;length&gt; field shall be the decimal length of the
extended header record in octets, including the trailing
&lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>The &lt;keyword&gt; field shall be one of the entries
from the following list or a keyword provided as an
implementation extension. Keywords consist- ing entirely of
lowercase letters, digits, and periods are reserved for
future standardization. A keyword shall not include an
equals sign. (In the following list, the notations
&quot;file(s)&quot; or &quot;block(s)&quot; is used to
acknowledge that a keyword affects the following single file
after a typeflag x extended header, but possibly multiple
files after typeflag g. Any requirements in the list for pax
to include a record when in write or copy mode shall apply
only when such a record has not already been provided
through the use of the -o option. When used in copy mode,
pax shall behave as if an archive had been created with
applicable extended header records and then extracted.)</p>

<p>atime The file access time for the following file(s),
equivalent to the value of the st_atime member of the stat
structure for a file, as described by the stat() function.
The access time shall be restored if the process has the
appropriate privilege required to do so. The format of the
&lt;value&gt; shall be as described in pax Extended Header
File Times .</p>

<p>charset The name of the character set used to encode the
data in the following file(s). The entries in the following
table are defined to refer to known standards; additional
names may be agreed on between the originator and
recipient.</p>

None.</p>

<p>The encoding is included in an extended header for
information only; when pax is used as described in IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, it shall not translate the file data into any
other encoding. The BINARY entry indi- cates unencoded
binary data.</p>

<p>When used in write or copy mode, it is
implementation-defined whether pax includes a charset
extended header record for a file.</p>

<p>comment A series of characters used as a comment. All
characters in the &lt;value&gt; field shall be ignored by
pax.</p>

<p>ctime The file creation time for the following file(s),
equivalent to the value of the st_ctime member of the stat
structure for a file, as described by the stat() function.
The creation time shall be restored if the process has the
appropriate privilege required to do so. The format of the
&lt;value&gt; shall be as described in pax Extended Header
File Times .</p>

<p>gid The group ID of the group that owns the file,
expressed as a decimal number using digits from the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard. This record shall override the gid field
in the following header block(s). When used in write or copy
mode, pax shall include a gid extended header record for
each file whose group ID is greater than 2097151 (octal
7777777).</p>

<p>gname The group of the file(s), formatted as a group
name in the group database. This record shall override the
gid and gname fields in the following header block(s), and
any gid extended header record. When used in read, copy, or
list mode, pax shall trans- late the name from the UTF-8
encoding in the header record to the character set
appropriate for the group database on the receiving system.
If any of the UTF-8 characters cannot be translated, and if
the -o invalid= UTF-8 option is not specified, the results
are implementation-defined. When used in write or copy mode,
pax shall include a gname extended header record for each
file whose group name cannot be represented entirely with
the letters and digits of the portable character set.</p>

<p>linkpath The pathname of a link being created to another
file, of any type, previously archived. This record shall
override the linkname field in the following ustar header
block(s). The fol- lowing ustar header block shall determine
the type of link cre- ated. If typeflag of the following
header block is 1, it shall be a hard link. If typeflag is
2, it shall be a symbolic link and the linkpath value shall
be the contents of the symbolic link. The pax utility shall
translate the name of the link (con- tents of the symbolic
link) from the UTF-8 encoding to the char- acter set
appropriate for the local file system. When used in write or
copy mode, pax shall include a linkpath extended header
record for each link whose pathname cannot be represented
entirely with the members of the portable character set
other than NUL.</p>

<p>mtime The file modification time of the following
file(s), equivalent to the value of the st_mtime member of
the stat structure for a file, as described in the stat()
function. This record shall override the mtime field in the
following header block(s). The modification time shall be
restored if the process has the appropriate privilege
required to do so. The format of the &lt;value&gt; shall be
as described in pax Extended Header File Times .</p>

<p>path The pathname of the following file(s). This record
shall over- ride the name and prefix fields in the following
header block(s). The pax utility shall translate the
pathname of the file from the UTF-8 encoding to the
character set appropriate for the local file system.</p>

<p>When used in write or copy mode, pax shall include a
path extended header record for each file whose pathname
cannot be represented entirely with the members of the
portable character set other than NUL.</p>

<p>realtime.any The keywords prefixed by
&quot;realtime.&quot; are reserved for future
standardization.</p>

<p>security.any The keywords prefixed by
&quot;security.&quot; are reserved for future
standardization.</p>

<p>size The size of the file in octets, expressed as a
decimal number using digits from the ISO/IEC 646:1991
standard. This record shall override the size field in the
following header block(s). When used in write or copy mode,
pax shall include a size extended header record for each
file with a size value greater than 8589934591 (octal
77777777777).</p>

<p>uid The user ID of the file owner, expressed as a
decimal number using digits from the ISO/IEC 646:1991
standard. This record shall override the uid field in the
following header block(s). When used in write or copy mode,
pax shall include a uid extended header record for each file
whose owner ID is greater than 2097151 (octal 7777777).</p>

<p>uname The owner of the following file(s), formatted as a
user name in the user database. This record shall override
the uid and uname fields in the following header block(s),
and any uid extended header record. When used in read, copy,
or list mode, pax shall translate the name from the UTF-8
encoding in the header record to the character set
appropriate for the user database on the receiving system.
If any of the UTF-8 characters cannot be translated, and if
the -o invalid= UTF-8 option is not speci- fied, the results
are implementation-defined. When used in write or copy mode,
pax shall include a uname extended header record for each
file whose user name cannot be represented entirely with the
letters and digits of the portable character set.</p>

<p>If the &lt;value&gt; field is zero length, it shall
delete any header block field, previously entered extended
header value, or global extended header value of the same
name.</p>

<p>If a keyword in an extended header record (or in a -o
option-argument) overrides or deletes a corresponding field
in the ustar header block, pax shall ignore the contents of
that header block field.</p>

<p>Unlike the ustar header block fields, NULs shall not
delimit &lt;value&gt;s; all characters within the
&lt;value&gt; field shall be considered data for the field.
None of the length limitations of the ustar header block
fields in ustar Header Block shall apply to the extended
header records.</p>

<p>pax Extended Header Keyword Precedence This section
describes the precedence in which the various header records
and fields and command line options are selected to apply to
a file in the archive. When pax is used in read or list
modes, it shall determine a file attribute in the following
sequence:</p>

<p>1. If -o delete= keyword-prefix is used, the affected
attributes shall be determined from step 7., if applicable,
or ignored otherwise.</p>

<p>2. If -o keyword:= is used, the affected attributes
shall be ignored.</p>

<p>3. If -o keyword := value is used, the affected
attribute shall be assigned the value.</p>

<p>4. If there is a typeflag x extended header record, the
affected attribute shall be assigned the &lt;value&gt;. When
extended header records conflict, the last one given in the
header shall take precedence.</p>

<p>5. If -o keyword = value is used, the affected attribute
shall be assigned the value.</p>

<p>6. If there is a typeflag g global extended header
record, the affected attribute shall be assigned the
&lt;value&gt;. When global extended header records conflict,
the last one given in the global header shall take
precedence.</p>

<p>7. Otherwise, the attribute shall be determined from the
ustar header block.</p>

<p>pax Extended Header File Times The pax utility shall
write an mtime record for each file in write or copy modes
if the files modification time cannot be represented exactly
in the ustar header logical record described in ustar Inter-
change Format . This can occur if the time is out of ustar
range, or if the file system of the underlying
implementation supports non-integer time granularities and
the time is not an integer. All of these time records shall
be formatted as a decimal representation of the time in
seconds since the Epoch. If a period (.) decimal point
character is present, the digits to the right of the point
shall represent the units of a subsecond timing granularity,
where the first digit is tenths of a second and each
subsequent digit is a tenth of the previous digit. In read
or copy mode, the pax utility shall truncate the time of a
file to the greatest value that is not greater than the
input header file time. In write or copy mode, the pax
utility shall output a time exactly if it can be represented
exactly as a decimal number, and otherwise shall generate
only enough digits so that the same time shall be recovered
if the file is extracted on a system whose underlying
implementation supports the same time granularity.</p>

<p>ustar Interchange Format A ustar archive tape or file
shall contain a series of logical records. Each logical
record shall be a fixed-size logical record of 512 octets
(see below). Although this format may be thought of as being
stored on 9-track industry-standard 12.7 mm (0.5 in)
magnetic tape, other types of transportable media are not
excluded. Each file archived shall be represented by a
header logical record that describes the file, fol- lowed by
zero or more logical records that give the contents of the
file. At the end of the archive file there shall be two
512-octet logi- cal records filled with binary zeros,
interpreted as an end-of-archive indicator.</p>

<p>The logical records may be grouped for physical I/O
operations, as described under the -b blocksize and -x ustar
options. Each group of logical records may be written with a
single operation equivalent to the write() function. On
magnetic tape, the result of this write shall be a single
tape physical block. The last physical block shall always be
the full size, so logical records after the two zero logical
records may contain undefined data.</p>

<p>The header logical record shall be structured as shown
in the following table. All lengths and offsets are in
decimal.</p>

<p>Table: ustar Header Block</p>

<p>Field Name Octet Offset Length (in Octets) name 0 100
mode 100 8 uid 108 8 gid 116 8 size 124 12 mtime 136 12
chksum 148 8 typeflag 156 1 linkname 157 100 magic 257 6
version 263 2 uname 265 32 gname 297 32 devmajor 329 8
devminor 337 8 prefix 345 155</p>

<p>All characters in the header logical record shall be
represented in the coded character set of the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard. For maximum portability between
implementations, names should be selected from characters
represented by the portable filename character set as octets
with the most significant bit zero. If an implementation
supports the use of characters outside of slash and the
portable filename character set in names for files, users,
and groups, one or more implementation- defined encodings of
these characters shall be provided for interchange
purposes.</p>

<p>However, the pax utility shall never create filenames on
the local sys- tem that cannot be accessed via the
procedures described in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If a filename
is found on the medium that would create an invalid
filename, it is implementation-defined whether the data from
the file is stored on the file hierarchy and under what name
it is stored. The pax utility may choose to ignore these
files as long as it produces an error indicating that the
file is being ignored.</p>

<p>Each field within the header logical record is
contiguous; that is, there is no padding used. Each
character on the archive medium shall be stored
contiguously.</p>

<p>The fields magic, uname, and gname are character strings
each termi- nated by a NUL character. The fields name,
linkname, and prefix are NUL-terminated character strings
except when all characters in the array contain non-NUL
characters including the last character. The ver- sion field
is two octets containing the characters &quot;00&quot;
(zero-zero). The typeflag contains a single character. All
other fields are leading zero-filled octal numbers using
digits from the ISO/IEC 646:1991 stan- dard IRV. Each
numeric field is terminated by one or more &lt;space&gt; or
NUL characters.</p>

<p>The name and the prefix fields shall produce the
pathname of the file. A new pathname shall be formed, if
prefix is not an empty string (its first character is not
NUL), by concatenating prefix (up to the first NUL
character), a slash character, and name; otherwise, name is
used alone. In either case, name is terminated at the first
NUL character. If prefix begins with a NUL character, it
shall be ignored. In this manner, pathnames of at most 256
characters can be supported. If a pathname does not fit in
the space provided, pax shall notify the user of the error,
and shall not store any part of the file-header or data- on
the medium.</p>

<p>The linkname field, described below, shall not use the
prefix to pro- duce a pathname. As such, a linkname is
limited to 100 characters. If the name does not fit in the
space provided, pax shall notify the user of the error, and
shall not attempt to store the link on the medium.</p>

<p>The mode field provides 12 bits encoded in the ISO/IEC
646:1991 stan- dard octal digit representation. The encoded
bits shall represent the following values:</p>

<p>Table: ustar mode Field</p>

<p>Bit Value IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 Bit Description 04000
S_ISUID Set UID on execution. 02000 S_ISGID Set GID on
execution. 01000 &lt;reserved&gt; Reserved for future
standardization. 00400 S_IRUSR Read permission for file
owner class. 00200 S_IWUSR Write permission for file owner
class. 00100 S_IXUSR Execute/search permission for file
owner class. 00040 S_IRGRP Read permission for file group
class. 00020 S_IWGRP Write permission for file group class.
00010 S_IXGRP Execute/search permission for file group
class. 00004 S_IROTH Read permission for file other class.
00002 S_IWOTH Write permission for file other class. 00001
S_IXOTH Execute/search permission for file other class.</p>

<p>When appropriate privilege is required to set one of
these mode bits, and the user restoring the files from the
archive does not have the appropriate privilege, the mode
bits for which the user does not have appropriate privilege
shall be ignored. Some of the mode bits in the archive
format are not mentioned elsewhere in this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001. If the implementation does not support
those bits, they may be ignored.</p>

<p>The uid and gid fields are the user and group ID of the
owner and group of the file, respectively.</p>

<p>The size field is the size of the file in octets. If the
typeflag field is set to specify a file to be of type 1 (a
link) or 2 (a symbolic link), the size field shall be
specified as zero. If the typeflag field is set to specify a
file of type 5 (directory), the size field shall be
interpreted as described under the definition of that record
type. No data logical records are stored for types 1, 2, or
5. If the typeflag field is set to 3 (character special
file), 4 (block special file), or 6 (FIFO), the meaning of
the size field is unspecified by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, and no data logical records shall be stored on
the medium. Additionally, for type 6, the size field shall
be ignored when reading. If the typeflag field is set to any
other value, the num- ber of logical records written
following the header shall be ( size+511)/512, ignoring any
fraction in the result of the division.</p>

<p>The mtime field shall be the modification time of the
file at the time it was archived. It is the ISO/IEC 646:1991
standard representation of the octal value of the
modification time obtained from the stat() func- tion.</p>

<p>The chksum field shall be the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
IRV representa- tion of the octal value of the simple sum of
all octets in the header logical record. Each octet in the
header shall be treated as an unsigned value. These values
shall be added to an unsigned integer, initialized to zero,
the precision of which is not less than 17 bits. When
calculating the checksum, the chksum field is treated as if
it were all spaces.</p>

<p>The typeflag field specifies the type of file archived.
If a particular implementation does not recognize the type,
or the user does not have appropriate privilege to create
that type, the file shall be extracted as if it were a
regular file if the file type is defined to have a meaning
for the size field that could cause data logical records to
be written on the medium (see the previous description for
size). If con- version to a regular file occurs, the pax
utility shall produce an error indicating that the
conversion took place. All of the typeflag fields shall be
coded in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV:</p>

<p>0 Represents a regular file. For
backwards-compatibility, a type- flag value of binary zero
0) should be recognized as mean- ing a regular file when
extracting files from the archive. Archives written with
this version of the archive file format create regular files
with a typeflag value of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
IRV0.</p>

<p>1 Represents a file linked to another file, of any type,
previ- ously archived. Such files are identified by each
file having the same device and file serial number. The
linked-to name is specified in the linkname field with a
NUL-character terminator if it is less than 100 octets in
length.</p>

<p>2 Represents a symbolic link. The contents of the
symbolic link shall be stored in the linkname field.</p>

<p>3,4 Represent character special files and block special
files respectively. In this case the devmajor and devminor
fields shall contain information defining the device, the
format of which is unspecified by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. Implementations may map the device
specifications to their own local specification or may
ignore the entry.</p>

<p>5 Specifies a directory or subdirectory. On systems
where disk allocation is performed on a directory basis, the
size field shall contain the maximum number of octets (which
may be rounded to the nearest disk block allocation unit)
that the directory may hold. A size field of zero indicates
no such limiting. Sys- tems that do not support limiting in
this manner should ignore the size field.</p>

<p>6 Specifies a FIFO special file. Note that the archiving
of a FIFO file archives the existence of this file and not
its contents.</p>

<p>7 Reserved to represent a file to which an
implementation has associated some high-performance
attribute. Implementations without such extensions should
treat this file as a regular file (type 0).</p>

<p>A-Z The letters A to , inclusive, are reserved for
custom implementations. All other values are reserved for
future ver- sions of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Attempts to archive a socket using ustar interchange
format shall pro- duce a diagnostic message. Handling of
other file types is implementa- tion-defined.</p>

<p>The magic field is the specification that this archive
was output in this archive format. If this field contains
ustar (the five characters from the ISO/IEC 646:1991
standard IRV shown followed by NUL), the uname and gname
fields shall contain the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV
representation of the owner and group of the file,
respectively (trun- cated to fit, if necessary). When the
file is restored by a privileged, protection-preserving
version of the utility, the user and group databases shall
be scanned for these names. If found, the user and group IDs
contained within these files shall be used rather than the
values contained within the uid and gid fields.</p>

<p>cpio Interchange Format The octet-oriented cpio archive
format shall be a series of entries, each comprising a
header that describes the file, the name of the file, and
then the contents of the file.</p>

<p>An archive may be recorded as a series of fixed-size
blocks of octets. This blocking shall be used only to make
physical I/O more efficient. The last group of blocks shall
always be at the full size.</p>

<p>For the octet-oriented cpio archive format, the
individual entry infor- mation shall be in the order
indicated and described by the following table; see also the
&lt;cpio.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>Table: Octet-Oriented cpio Archive Entry</p>

<p>Header Field Name Length (in Octets) Interpreted as
c_magic 6 Octal number c_dev 6 Octal number c_ino 6 Octal
number c_mode 6 Octal number c_uid 6 Octal number c_gid 6
Octal number c_nlink 6 Octal number c_rdev 6 Octal number
c_mtime 11 Octal number c_namesize 6 Octal number c_filesize
11 Octal number Filename Field Name Length Interpreted as
c_name c_namesize Pathname string File Data Field Name
Length Interpreted as c_filedata c_filesize Data</p>

<p>cpio Header For each file in the archive, a header as
defined previously shall be written. The information in the
header fields is written as streams of the ISO/IEC 646:1991
standard characters interpreted as octal numbers. The octal
numbers shall be extended to the necessary length by append-
ing the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV zeros at the
most-significant- digit end of the number; the result is
written to the most-significant digit of the stream of
octets first. The fields shall be interpreted as
follows:</p>

<p>c_magic Identify the archive as being a transportable
archive by con- taining the identifying value
&quot;070707&quot; .</p>

<p>c_dev, c_ino Contains values that uniquely identify the
file within the archive (that is, no files contain the same
pair of c_dev and c_ino values unless they are links to the
same file). The values shall be determined in an unspecified
manner.</p>

<p>c_mode Contains the file type and access permissions as
defined in the following table.</p>

<p>Table: Values for cpio c_mode Field</p>

<p>File Permissions Name Value Indicates C_IRUSR 000400
Read by owner C_IWUSR 000200 Write by owner C_IXUSR 000100
Execute by owner C_IRGRP 000040 Read by group C_IWGRP 000020

000004 Read by others</p>

<p>C_IWOTH 000002 Write by others C_IXOTH 000001 Execute by
others C_ISUID 004000 Set uid C_ISGID 002000 Set gid C_ISVTX
001000 Reserved File Type Name Value Indicates C_ISDIR

Regular file C_ISLNK 0120000 Symbolic link C_ISBLK 060000
Block special file C_ISCHR 020000 Character special file
C_ISSOCK 0140000 Socket C_ISCTG 0110000 Reserved</p>

<p>Directories, FIFOs, symbolic links, and regular files
shall be sup- ported on a system conforming to this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001; additional values defined
previously are reserved for compatibility with existing
systems. Additional file types may be supported; how- ever,
such files should not be written to archives intended to be
transported to other systems.</p>

<p>c_uid Contains the user ID of the owner.</p>

<p>c_gid Contains the group ID of the group.</p>

<p>c_nlink Contains the number of links referencing the
file at the time the archive was created.</p>

<p>c_rdev Contains implementation-defined information for
character or block special files.</p>

<p>c_mtime Contains the latest time of modification of the
file at the time the archive was created.</p>

<p>c_namesize Contains the length of the pathname,
including the terminating NUL character.</p>

<p>c_filesize Contains the length of the file in octets.
This shall be the length of the data section following the
header structure.</p>

<p>cpio Filename The c_name field shall contain the
pathname of the file. The length of this field in octets is
the value of c_namesize.</p>

<p>If a filename is found on the medium that would create
an invalid path- name, it is implementation-defined whether
the data from the file is stored on the file hierarchy and
under what name it is stored.</p>

<p>All characters shall be represented in the ISO/IEC
646:1991 standard IRV. For maximum portability between
implementations, names should be selected from characters
represented by the portable filename character set as octets
with the most significant bit zero. If an implementation
supports the use of characters outside the portable filename
character set in names for files, users, and groups, one or
more implementation- defined encodings of these characters
shall be provided for interchange purposes. However, the pax
utility shall never create filenames on the local system
that cannot be accessed via the procedures described pre-
viously in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If a
filename is found on the medium that would create an invalid
filename, it is implementa- tion-defined whether the data
from the file is stored on the local file system and under
what name it is stored. The pax utility may choose to ignore
these files as long as it produces an error indicating that
the file is being ignored.</p>

<p>cpio File Data Following c_name, there shall be
c_filesize octets of data. Interpreta- tion of such data
occurs in a manner dependent on the file. If c_filesize is
zero, no data shall be contained in c_filedata.</p>

<p>When restoring from an archive:</p>

<p>* If the user does not have the appropriate privilege to
create a file of the specified type, pax shall ignore the
entry and write an error message to standard error.</p>

<p>* Only regular files have data to be restored. Presuming
a regular file meets any selection criteria that might be
imposed on the for- mat-reading utility by the user, such
data shall be restored.</p>

<p>* If a user does not have appropriate privilege to set a
particular mode flag, the flag shall be ignored. Some of the
mode flags in the archive format are not mentioned elsewhere
in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the
implementation does not support those flags, they may be
ignored.</p>

<p>cpio Special Entries FIFO special files, directories,
and the trailer shall be recorded with c_filesize equal to
zero. For other special files, c_filesize is unspecified by
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. The header for the next
file entry in the archive shall be written directly after
the last octet of the file entry preceding it. A header
denoting the filename TRAILER!!! shall indicate the end of
the archive; the contents of octets in the last block of the
archive following such a header are undefined.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All files were processed successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If pax cannot create a file or a
link when reading an archive or cannot find a file when
writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user ID, group
ID, or file mode when the -p option is specified, a
diagnostic message shall be written to standard error and a
non-zero exit status shall be returned, but processing shall
continue. In the case where pax cannot create a link to a
file, pax shall not, by default, create a second copy of the
file.</p>

<p>If the extraction of a file from an archive is
prematurely terminated by a signal or error, pax may have
only partially extracted the file or (if the -n option was
not specified) may have extracted a file of the same name as
that specified by the user, but which is not the file the
user wanted. Additionally, the file modes of extracted
directories may have additional bits from the S_IRWXU mask
set as well as incorrect modification and access times.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The -p (privileges) option was
invented to reconcile differences between historical tar and
cpio implementations. In particular, the two utilities use
-m in diametrically opposed ways. The -p option also pro-
vides a consistent means of extending the ways in which
future file attributes can be addressed, such as for
enhanced security systems or high-performance files.
Although it may seem complex, there are really two modes
that are most commonly used:</p>

<p>-p e Preserve everything&quot;. This would be used by
the historical superuser, someone with all the appropriate
privileges, to pre- serve all aspects of the files as they
are recorded in the archive. The e flag is the sum of o and
p, and other implemen- tation-defined attributes.</p>

<p>-p p Preserve&quot; the file mode bits. This would be
used by the user with regular privileges who wished to
preserve aspects of the file other than the ownership. The
file times are preserved by default, but two other flags are
offered to disable these and use the time of extraction.</p>

<p>The one pathname per line format of standard input
precludes pathnames containing &lt;newline&gt;s. Although
such pathnames violate the portable filename guidelines,
they may exist and their presence may inhibit usage of pax
within shell scripts. This problem is inherited from his-
torical archive programs. The problem can be avoided by
listing file- name arguments on the command line instead of
on standard input.</p>

<p>It is almost certain that appropriate privileges are
required for pax to accomplish parts of this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001. Specifi- cally, creating files of type
block special or character special, restoring file access
times unless the files are owned by the user (the -t
option), or preserving file owner, group, and mode (the -p
option) all probably require appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>In read mode, implementations are permitted to overwrite
files when the archive has multiple members with the same
name. This may fail if per- missions on the first version of
the file do not permit it to be over- written.</p>

<p>The cpio and ustar formats can only support files up to
8589934592 bytes (8 * 2^30) in size.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following command:</p>

<p>pax -w -f /dev/rmt/1m .</p>

<p>copies the contents of the current directory to tape
drive 1, medium density (assuming historical System V device
naming procedures-the his- torical BSD device name would be
/dev/rmt9).</p>

<p>The following commands:</p>

<p>mkdir newdirpax -rw olddir newdir</p>

<p>copy the olddir directory hierarchy to newdir.</p>

<p>pax -r -s,^//*usr//*,,-f a.pax</p>

<p>reads the archive a.pax, with all files rooted in /usr
in the archive extracted relative to the current
directory.</p>

<p>Using the option:</p>

<p>-o listopt=&quot;%M %(atime)T %(size)D
%(name)s&quot;</p>

<p>overrides the default output description in Standard
Output and instead writes:</p>

<p>-rw-rw--- Jan 12 15:53 1492 /usr/foo/bar</p>

<p>Using the options:</p>

<p>-o listopt= %t%(size)n%.7 -o listopt=
(name)n%(ctime)n%T</p>

<p>overrides the default output description in Standard
Output and instead writes:</p>

<p>/usr/foo/bar -&gt; /tmp 1492 /usr/fo Jan 12 1991 Jan 31
15:53</p>

<p>RATIONALE The pax utility was new for the ISO
POSIX-2:1993 standard. It repre- sents a peaceful compromise
between advocates of the historical tar and cpio
utilities.</p>

<p>A fundamental difference between cpio and tar was in the
way directo- ries were treated. The cpio utility did not
treat directories differ- ently from other files, and to
select a directory and its contents required that each file
in the hierarchy be explicitly specified. For tar, a
directory matched every file in the file hierarchy it
rooted.</p>

<p>The pax utility offers both interfaces; by default,
directories map into the file hierarchy they root. The -d
option causes pax to skip any file not explicitly
referenced, as cpio historically did. The tar - style
behavior was chosen as the default because it was believed
that this was the more common usage and because tar is the
more commonly available interface, as it was historically
provided on both System V and BSD implementations.</p>

<p>The data interchange format specification in this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that processes with
&quot;appropriate privi- leges&quot; shall always restore
the ownership and permissions of extracted files exactly as
archived. If viewed from the historic equivalence between
superuser and &quot;appropriate privileges&quot;, there are
two problems with this requirement. First, users running as
superusers may unknow- ingly set dangerous permissions on
extracted files. Second, it is need- lessly limiting, in
that superusers cannot extract files and own them as
superuser unless the archive was created by the superuser.
(It should be noted that restoration of ownerships and
permissions for the superuser, by default, is historical
practice in cpio, but not in tar.) In order to avoid these
two problems, the pax specification has an additional
&quot;privilege&quot; mechanism, the -p option. Only a pax
invocation with the privileges needed, and which has the -p
option set using the e specification character, has the
&quot;appropriate privilege&quot; to restore full ownership
and permission information.</p>

<p>Note also that this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
requires that the file ownership and access permissions
shall be set, on extraction, in the same fashion as the
creat() function when provided with the mode stored in the
archive. This means that the file creation mask of the user
is applied to the file permissions.</p>

<p>Users should note that directories may be created by pax
while extract- ing files with permissions that are different
from those that existed at the time the archive was created.
When extracting sensitive informa- tion into a directory
hierarchy that no longer exists, users are encouraged to set
their file creation mask appropriately to protect these
files during extraction.</p>

<p>The table of contents output is written to standard
output to facili- tate pipeline processing.</p>

<p>An early proposal had hard links displaying for all
pathnames. This was removed because it complicates the
output of the case where -v is not specified and does not
match historical cpio usage. The hard-link information is
available in the -v display.</p>

<p>The description of the -l option allows implementations
to make hard links to symbolic links. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
does not specify any way to create a hard link to a symbolic
link, but many implementations pro- vide this capability as
an extension. If there are hard links to sym- bolic links
when an archive is created, the implementation is required
to archive the hard link in the archive (unless -H or -L is
specified). When in read mode and in copy mode,
implementations supporting hard links to symbolic links
should use them when appropriate.</p>

<p>The archive formats inherited from the POSIX.1-1990
standard have cer- tain restrictions that have been brought
along from historical usage. For example, there are
restrictions on the length of pathnames stored in the
archive. When pax is used in copy( -rw) mode (copying
directory hierarchies), the ability to use extensions from
the -x pax format overcomes these restrictions.</p>

<p>The default blocksize value of 5120 bytes for cpio was
selected because it is one of the standard block-size values
for cpio, set when the -B option is specified. (The other
default block-size value for cpio is 512 bytes, and this was
considered to be too small.) The default block value of
10240 bytes for tar was selected because that is the
standard block-size value for BSD tar. The maximum block
size of 32256 bytes (2**15-512 bytes) is the largest
multiple of 512 bytes that fits into a signed 16-bit tape
controller transfer register. There are known limi- tations
in some historical systems that would prevent larger blocks
from being accepted. Historical values were chosen to
improve compati- bility with historical scripts using dd or
similar utilities to manipu- late archives. Also, default
block sizes for any file type other than character special
file has been deleted from this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 as unimportant and not likely to affect the
struc- ture of the resulting archive.</p>

<p>Implementations are permitted to modify the block-size
value based on the archive format or the device to which the
archive is being written. This is to provide implementations
with the opportunity to take advan- tage of special types of
devices, and it should not be used without a great deal of
consideration as it almost certainly decreases archive
portability.</p>

<p>The intended use of the -n option was to permit
extraction of one or more files from the archive without
processing the entire archive. This was viewed by the
standard developers as offering significant perfor- mance
advantages over historical implementations. The -n option in
early proposals had three effects; the first was to cause
special char- acters in patterns to not be treated
specially. The second was to cause only the first file that
matched a pattern to be extracted. The third was to cause
pax to write a diagnostic message to standard error when no
file was found matching a specified pattern. Only the second
behav- ior is retained by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, for many rea- sons. First, it is in general not
acceptable for a single option to have multiple effects.
Second, the ability to make pattern matching characters act
as normal characters is useful for parts of pax other than
file extraction. Third, a finer degree of control over the
spe- cial characters is useful because users may wish to
normalize only a single special character in a single
filename. Fourth, given a more general escape mechanism, the
previous behavior of the -n option can be easily obtained
using the -s option or a sed script. Finally, writing a
diagnostic message when a pattern specified by the user is
unmatched by any file is useful behavior in all cases.</p>

<p>In this version, the -n was removed from the copy mode
synopsis of pax; it is inapplicable because there are no
pattern operands specified in this mode.</p>

<p>There is another method than pax for copying subtrees in
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 described as part of the cp utility.
Both methods are historical practice: cp provides a simpler,
more intuitive inter- face, while pax offers a finer
granularity of control. Each provides additional
functionality to the other; in particular, pax maintains the
hard-link structure of the hierarchy while cp does not. It
is the intention of the standard developers that the results
be similar (using appropriate option combinations in both
utilities). The results are not required to be identical;
there seemed insufficient gain to applica- tions to balance
the difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that
the results would be exactly identical.</p>

<p>A single archive may span more than one file. It is
suggested that implementations provide informative messages
to the user on standard error whenever the archive file is
changed.</p>

<p>The -d option (do not create intermediate directories
not listed in the archive) found in early proposals was
originally provided as a comple- ment to the historic -d
option of cpio. It has been deleted.</p>

<p>The -s option in early proposals specified a subset of
the substitution command from the ed utility. As there was
no reason for only a subset to be supported, the -s option
is now compatible with the current ed specification. Since
the delimiter can be any non-null character, the following
usage with single spaces is valid:</p>

<p>pax -s &quot; foo bar &quot; ...</p>

<p>The -t description is worded so as to note that this may
cause the access time update caused by some other activity
(which occurs while the file is being read) to be
overwritten.</p>

<p>The default behavior of pax with regard to file
modification times is the same as historical implementations
of tar. It is not the historical behavior of cpio.</p>

<p>Because the -i option uses /dev/tty, utilities without a
controlling terminal are not able to use this option.</p>

<p>The -y option, found in early proposals, has been
deleted because a line containing a single period for the -i
option has equivalent func- tionality. The special lines for
the -i option (a single period and the empty line) are
historical practice in cpio.</p>

<p>In early drafts, a -e charmap option was included to
increase portabil- ity of files between systems using
different coded character sets. This option was omitted
because it was apparent that consensus could not be formed
for it. In this version, the use of UTF-8 should be an
adequate substitute.</p>

<p>The -k option was added to address international
concerns about the dangers involved in the character set
transformations of -e (if the target character set were
different from the source, the filenames might be
transformed into names matching existing files) and also was
made more general to protect files transferred between file
systems with different {NAME_MAX} values (truncating a
filename on a smaller system might also inadvertently
overwrite existing files). As stated, it prevents any
overwriting, even if the target file is older than the
source. This version adds more granularity of options to
solve this problem by introducing the -o invalid=
option-specifically the UTF-8 action. (Note that an existing
file that is named with a UTF-8 encoding is still subject to
overwriting in this case. The -k option closes that
loophole.)</p>

<p>Some of the file characteristics referenced in this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 might not be supported by
some archive formats. For example, neither the tar nor cpio
formats contain the file access time. For this reason, the e
specification character has been provided, intended to cause
all file characteristics specified in the archive to be
retained.</p>

<p>It is required that extracted directories, by default,
have their access and modification times and permissions set
to the values speci- fied in the archive. This has obvious
problems in that the directories are almost certainly
modified after being extracted and that directory
permissions may not permit file creation. One possible
solution is to create directories with the mode specified in
the archive, as modified by the umask of the user, with
sufficient permissions to allow file creation. After all
files have been extracted, pax would then reset the access
and modification times and permissions as necessary.</p>

<p>The list-mode formatting description borrows heavily
from the one defined by the printf utility. However, since
there is no separate operand list to get conversion
arguments, the format was extended to allow specifying the
name of the conversion argument as part of the conversion
specification.</p>

<p>The T conversion specifier allows time fields to be
displayed in any of the date formats. Unlike the ls utility,
pax does not adjust the format when the date is less than
six months in the past. This makes parsing the output more
predictable.</p>

<p>The D conversion specifier handles the ability to
display the major/minor or file size, as with ls, by using
%-8(size)D.</p>

<p>The L conversion specifier handles the ls display for
symbolic links.</p>

<p>Conversion specifiers were added to generate existing
known types used for ls.</p>

<p>pax Interchange Format The new POSIX data interchange
format was developed primarily to sat- isfy international
concerns that the ustar and cpio formats did not provide for
file, user, and group names encoded in characters outside a
subset of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. The standard
developers real- ized that this new POSIX data interchange
format should be very exten- sible because there were other
requirements they foresaw in the near future:</p>

<p>* Support international character encodings and locale
information</p>

<p>* Support security information (ACLs, and so on)</p>

<p>* Support future file types, such as realtime or
contiguous files</p>

<p>* Include data areas for implementation use</p>

<p>* Support systems with words larger than 32 bits and
timers with sub- second granularity</p>

<p>The following were not goals for this format because
these are better handled by separate utilities or are
inappropriate for a portable for- mat:</p>

<p>* Encryption</p>

<p>* Compression</p>

<p>* Data translation between locales and codesets</p>

<p>* inode storage</p>

<p>The format chosen to support the goals is an extension
of the ustar format. Of the two formats previously
available, only the ustar format was selected for extensions
because:</p>

<p>* It was easier to extend in an upwards-compatible way.
It offered version flags and header block type fields with
room for future standardization. The cpio format, while
possessing a more flexible file naming methodology, could
not be extended without breaking some theoretical
implementation or using a dummy filename that could be a
legitimate filename.</p>

<p>* Industry experience since the original &quot; tar
wars&quot; fought in devel- oping the ISO POSIX-1 standard
has clearly been in favor of the ustar format, which is
generally the default output format selected for pax
implementations on new systems.</p>

<p>The new format was designed with one additional goal in
mind: reason- able behavior when an older tar or pax utility
happened to read an archive. Since the POSIX.1-1990 standard
mandated that a &quot;format-read- ing utility&quot; had to
treat unrecognized typeflag values as regular files, this
allowed the format to include all the extended information
in a pseudo-regular file that preceded each real file. An
option is given that allows the archive creator to set up
reasonable names for these files on the older systems. Also,
the normative text suggests that reasonable file access
values be used for this ustar header block. Making these
header files inaccessible for convenient reading and
deleting would not be reasonable. File permissions of 600 or
700 are suggested.</p>

<p>The ustar typeflag field was used to accommodate the
additional func- tionality of the new format rather than
magic or version because the POSIX.1-1990 standard (and, by
reference, the previous version of pax), mandated the
behavior of the format-reading utility when it encountered
an unknown typeflag, but was silent about the other two
fields.</p>

<p>Early proposals of the first revision to IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 contained a proposed archive format that was
based on compatibility with the standard for tape files (ISO
1001, similar to the format used histori- cally on many
mainframes and minicomputers). This format was overly
complex and required considerable overhead in volume and
header records. Furthermore, the standard developers felt
that it would not be acceptable to the community of POSIX
developers, so it was later changed to be a format more
closely related to historical practice on POSIX systems.</p>

<p>The prefix and name split of pathnames in ustar was
replaced by the single path extended header record for
simplicity.</p>

<p>The concept of a global extended header ( typeflag g)
was controver- sial. If this were applied to an archive
being recorded on magnetic tape, a few unreadable blocks at
the beginning of the tape could be a serious problem; a
utility attempting to extract as many files as pos- sible
from a damaged archive could lose a large percentage of file
header information in this case. However, if the archive
were on a reliable medium, such as a CD-ROM, the global
extended header offers considerable potential size
reductions by eliminating redundant infor- mation. Thus, the
text warns against using the global method for unre- liable
media and provides a method for implanting global
information in the extended header for each file, rather
than in the typeflag g records.</p>

<p>No facility for data translation or filtering on a
per-file basis is included because the standard developers
could not invent an interface that would allow this in an
efficient manner. If a filter, such as encryption or
compression, is to be applied to all the files, it is more
efficient to apply the filter to the entire archive as a
single file. The standard developers considered interfaces
that would invoke a shell script for each file going into or
out of the archive, but the system overhead in this approach
was considered to be too high.</p>

<p>One such approach would be to have filter= records that
give a pathname for an executable. When the program is
invoked, the file and archive would be open for standard
input/output and all the header fields would be available as
environment variables or command-line arguments. The
standard developers did discuss such schemes, but they were
omitted from IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 due to concerns about
excessive overhead. Also, the program itself would need to
be in the archive if it were to be used portably.</p>

<p>There is currently no portable means of identifying the
character set(s) used for a file in the file system.
Therefore, pax has not been given a mechanism to generate
charset records automatically. The only portable means of
doing this is for the user to write the archive using the -o
charset= string command line option. This assumes that all
of the files in the archive use the same encoding. The
&quot;implementation- defined&quot; text is included to
allow for a system that can identify the encodings used for
each of its files.</p>

<p>The table of standards that accompanies the charset
record description is acknowledged to be very limited. Only
a limited number of character set standards is reasonable
for maximal interchange. Any character set is, of course,
possible by prior agreement. It was suggested that EBCDIC be
listed, but it was omitted because it is not defined by a
formal standard. Formal standards, and then only those with
reasonably large followings, can be included here, simply as
a matter of practicality. The &lt;value&gt;s represent names
of officially registered character sets in the format
required by the ISO 2375:1985 standard.</p>

<p>The normal comma or &lt;blank&gt;-separated list rules
are not followed in the case of keyword options to allow
ease of argument parsing for getopts.</p>

<p>Further information on character encodings is in pax
Archive Character Set Encoding/Decoding .</p>

<p>The standard developers have reserved keyword name space
for vendor extensions. It is suggested that the format to be
used is:</p>

<p>VENDOR.keyword</p>

<p>where VENDOR is the name of the vendor or organization
in all uppercase letters. It is further suggested that the
keyword following the period be named differently than any
of the standard keywords so that it could be used for future
standardization, if appropriate, by omitting the VENDOR
prefix.</p>

<p>The &lt;length&gt; field in the extended header record
was included to make it simpler to step through the records,
even if a record contains an unknown format (to a particular
pax) with complex interactions of spe- cial characters. It
also provides a minor integrity checkpoint within the
records to aid a program attempting to recover files from a
damaged archive.</p>

<p>There are no extended header versions of the devmajor
and devminor fields because the unspecified format ustar
header field should be suf- ficient. If they are not,
vendor-specific extended keywords (such as VENDOR.devmajor)
should be used.</p>

<p>Device and i-number labeling of files was not adopted
from cpio; files are interchanged strictly on a symbolic
name basis, as in ustar.</p>

<p>Just as with the ustar format descriptions, the new
format makes no special arrangements for multi-volume
archives. Each of the pax archive types is assumed to be
inside a single POSIX file and splitting that file over
multiple volumes (diskettes, tape cartridges, and so on),
processing their labels, and mounting each in the proper
sequence are considered to be implementation details that
cannot be described portably.</p>

<p>The pax format is intended for interchange, not only for
backup on a single (family of) systems. It is not as densely
packed as might be possible for backup:</p>

<p>* It contains information as coded characters that could
be coded in binary.</p>

<p>* It identifies extended records with name fields that
could be omit- ted in favor of a fixed-field layout.</p>

<p>* It translates names into a portable character set and
identifies locale-related information, both of which are
probably unnecessary for backup.</p>

<p>The requirements on restoring from an archive are
slightly different from the historical wording, allowing for
non-monolithic privilege to bring forward as much as
possible. In particular, attributes such as &quot;high
performance file&quot; might be broadly but not universally
granted while set-user-ID or chown() might be much more
restricted. There is no implication in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
that the security information be honored after it is
restored to the file hierarchy, in spite of what might be
improperly inferred by the silence on that topic. That is a
topic for another standard.</p>

<p>Links are recorded in the fashion described here because
a link can be to any file type. It is desirable in general
to be able to restore part of an archive selectively and
restore all of those files completely. If the data is not
associated with each link, it is not possible to do this.
However, the data associated with a file can be large, and
when selective restoration is not needed, this can be a
significant burden. The archive is structured so that files
that have no associated data can always be restored by the
name of any link name of any link, and the user may choose
whether data is recorded with each instance of a file that
contains data. The format permits mixing of both types of
links in a single archive; this can be done for special
needs, and pax is expected to interpret such archives on
input properly, despite the fact that there is no pax option
that would force this mixed case on output. (When -o
linkdata is used, the output must contain the dupli- cate
data, but the implementation is free to include it or omit
it when -o linkdata is not used.)</p>

<p>The time values are included as extended header records
for those implementations needing more than the eleven octal
digits allowed by the ustar format. Portable file timestamps
cannot be negative. If pax encounters a file with a negative
timestamp in copy or write mode, it can reject the file,
substitute a non-negative timestamp, or generate a
non-portable timestamp with a leading-. Even though some
implemen- tations can support finer file-time granularities
than seconds, the normative text requires support only for
seconds since the Epoch because the ISO POSIX-1 standard
states them that way. The ustar format includes only mtime;
the new format adds atime and ctime for symmetry. The atime
access time restored to the file system will be affected by
the -p a and -p e options. The ctime creation time (actually
inode modification time) is described with &quot;appropriate
privilege&quot; so that it can be ignored when writing to
the file system. POSIX does not provide a portable means to
change file creation time. Nothing is intended to prevent a
non-portable implementation of pax from restoring the
value.</p>

<p>The gid, size, and uid extended header records were
included to allow expansion beyond the sizes specified in
the regular tar header. New file system architectures are
emerging that will exhaust the 12-digit size field. There
are probably not many systems requiring more than 8 digits
for user and group IDs, but the extended header values were
included for completeness, allowing overrides for all of the
decimal values in the tar header.</p>

<p>The standard developers intended to describe the
effective results of pax with regard to file ownerships and
permissions; implementations are not restricted in timing or
sequencing the restoration of such, pro- vided the results
are as specified.</p>

<p>Much of the text describing the extended headers refers
to use in &quot; write or copy modes&quot;. The copy mode
references are due to the normative text: &quot;The effect
of the copy shall be as if the copied files were written to
an archive file and then subsequently extracted ...&quot;.
There is certainly no way to test whether pax is actually
generating the extended headers in copy mode, but the
effects must be as if it had.</p>

<p>pax Archive Character Set Encoding/Decoding There is a
need to exchange archives of files between systems of dif-
ferent native codesets. Filenames, group names, and user
names must be preserved to the fullest extent possible when
an archive is read on the receiving platform. Translation of
the contents of files is not within the scope of the pax
utility.</p>

<p>There will also be the need to represent characters that
are not avail- able on the receiving platform. These
unsupported characters cannot be automatically folded to the
local set of characters due to the chance of collisions.
This could result in overwriting previous extracted files
from the archive or pre-existing files on the system.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the codeset used to represent
characters within the extended header records of the pax
archive must be sufficiently rich to handle all commonly
used character sets. The fields requiring transla- tion
include, at a minimum, filenames, user names, group names,
and link pathnames. Implementations may wish to have
localized extended keywords that use non-portable
characters.</p>

<p>The standard developers considered the following
options:</p>

<p>* The archive creator specifies the well-defined name of
the source codeset. The receiver must then recognize the
codeset name and per- form the appropriate translations to
the destination codeset.</p>

<p>* The archive creator includes within the archive the
character map- ping table for the source codeset used to
encode extended header records. The receiver must then read
the character mapping table and perform the appropriate
translations to the destination codeset.</p>

<p>* The archive creator translates the extended header
records in the source codeset into a canonical form. The
receiver must then perform the appropriate translations to
the destination codeset.</p>

<p>The approach that incorporates the name of the source
codeset poses the problem of codeset name registration, and
makes the archive useless to pax archive decoders that do
not recognize that codeset.</p>

<p>Because parts of an archive may be corrupted, the
standard developers felt that including the character map of
the source codeset was too fragile. The loss of this one key
component could result in making the entire archive useless.
(The difference between this and the global extended header
decision was that the latter has a workaround-duplicat- ing
extended header records on unreliable media-but this would
be too burdensome for large character set maps.)</p>

<p>Both of the above approaches also put an undue burden on
the pax archive receiver to handle the cross-product of all
source and destina- tion codesets.</p>

<p>To simplify the translation from the source codeset to
the canonical form and from the canonical form to the
destination codeset, the stan- dard developers decided that
the internal representation should be a stateless encoding.
A stateless encoding is one where each codepoint has the
same meaning, without regard to the decoder being in a
specific state. An example of a stateful encoding would be
the Japanese Shift- JIS; an example of a stateless encoding
would be the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard (equivalent to 7-bit
ASCII).</p>

<p>For these reasons, the standard developers decided to
adopt a canonical format for the representation of file
information strings. The obvious, well-endorsed candidate is
the ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard (based in part on
Unicode), which can be used to represent the characters of
vir- tually all standardized character sets. The standard
developers ini- tially agreed upon using UCS2 (16-bit
Unicode) as the internal repre- sentation. This repertoire
of characters provides a sufficiently rich set to represent
all commonly-used codesets.</p>

<p>However, the standard developers found that the 16-bit
Unicode repre- sentation had some problems. It forced the
issue of standardizing byte ordering. The 2-byte length of
each character made the extended header records twice as
long for the case of strings coded entirely from his-
torical 7-bit ASCII. For these reasons, the standard
developers chose the UTF-8 defined in the ISO/IEC
10646-1:2000 standard. This multi-byte representation
encodes UCS2 or UCS4 characters reliably and determinis-
tically, eliminating the need for a canonical byte ordering.
In addi- tion, NUL octets and other characters possibly
confusing to POSIX file systems do not appear, except to
represent themselves. It was realized that certain national
codesets take up more space after the encoding, due to their
placement within the UCS range; it was felt that the use-
fulness of the encoding of the names outweighs the
disadvantage of size increase for file, user, and group
names.</p>

<p>The encoding of UTF-8 is as follows:</p>

<p>UCS4 Hex Encoding UTF-8 Binary Encoding</p>

<p>00000000-0000007F 0xxxxxxx 00000080-000007FF 110xxxxx
10xxxxxx 00000800-0000FFFF 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
00010000-001FFFFF 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
00200000-03FFFFFF 111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
10xxxxxx 04000000-7FFFFFFF 1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx</p>

<p>where each xrepresents a bit value from the character
being trans- lated.</p>

<p>ustar Interchange Format The description of the ustar
format reflects numerous enhancements over pre-1988 versions
of the historical tar utility. The goal of these changes was
not only to provide the functional enhancements desired, but
also to retain compatibility between new and old versions.
This compatibility has been retained. Archives written using
the old archive format are compatible with the new
format.</p>

<p>Implementors should be aware that the previous file
format did not include a mechanism to archive directory type
files. For this reason, the convention of using a filename
ending with slash was adopted to specify a directory on the
archive.</p>

<p>The total size of the name and prefix fields have been
set to meet the minimum requirements for {PATH_MAX}. If a
pathname will fit within the name field, it is recommended
that the pathname be stored there without the use of the
prefix field. Although the name field is known to be too
small to contain {PATH_MAX} characters, the value was not
changed in this version of the archive file format to retain
backwards-compatibil- ity, and instead the prefix was
introduced. Also, because of the ear- lier version of the
format, there is no way to remove the restriction on the
linkname field being limited in size to just that of the
name field.</p>

<p>The size field is required to be meaningful in all
implementation extensions, although it could be zero. This
is required so that the data blocks can always be properly
counted.</p>

<p>It is suggested that if device special files need to be
represented that cannot be represented in the standard
format, that one of the extension types ( A- Z) be used, and
that the additional information for the special file be
represented as data and be reflected in the size field.</p>

<p>Attempting to restore a special file type, where it is
converted to ordinary data and conflicts with an existing
filename, need not be spe- cially detected by the utility.
If run as an ordinary user, pax should not be able to
overwrite the entries in, for example, /dev in any case
(whether the file is converted to another type or not). If
run as a privileged user, it should be able to do so, and it
would be considered a bug if it did not. The same is true of
ordinary data files and simi- larly named special files; it
is impossible to anticipate the needs of the user (who could
really intend to overwrite the file), so the behav- ior
should be predictable (and thus regular) and rely on the
protection system as required.</p>

<p>The value 7 in the typeflag field is intended to define
how contiguous files can be stored in a ustar archive. IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 does not require the contiguous file
extension, but does define a standard way of archiving such
files so that all conforming systems can interpret these
file types in a meaningful and consistent manner. On a
system that does not support extended file types, the pax
utility should do the best it can with the file and go on to
the next.</p>

<p>The file protection modes are those conventionally used
by the ls util- ity. This is extended beyond the usage in
the ISO POSIX-2 standard to support the &quot;shared
text&quot; or &quot;sticky&quot; bit. It is intended that
the con- formance document should not document anything
beyond the existence of and support of such a mode. Further
extensions are expected to these bits, particularly with
overloading the set-user-ID and set-group-ID flags.</p>

<p>cpio Interchange Format The reference to appropriate
privilege in the cpio format refers to an error on standard
output; the ustar format does not make comparable
statements.</p>

<p>The model for this format was the historical System V
cpio -c data interchange format. This model documents the
portable version of the cpio format and not the binary
version. It has the flexibility to transfer data of any type
described within IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, yet is extensible to
transfer data types specific to extensions beyond IEEE Std
1003.1-2001 (for example, contiguous files). Because it
describes existing practice, there is no question of
maintaining upwards-compatibility.</p>

<p>cpio Header There has been some concern that the size of
the c_ino field of the header is too small to handle those
systems that have very large inode numbers. However, the
c_ino field in the header is used strictly as a hard-link
resolution mechanism for archives. It is not necessarily the
same value as the inode number of the file in the location
from which that file is extracted.</p>

<p>The name c_magic is based on historical usage.</p>

<p>cpio Filename For most historical implementations of the
cpio utility, {PATH_MAX} octets can be used to describe the
pathname without the addition of any other header fields
(the NUL character would be included in this count).
{PATH_MAX} is the minimum value for pathname size,
documented as 256 bytes. However, an implementation may use
c_namesize to deter- mine the exact length of the pathname.
With the current description of the &lt;cpio.h&gt; header,
this pathname size can be as large as a number that is
described in six octal digits.</p>

<p>Two values are documented under the c_mode field values
to provide for extensibility for known file types:</p>

<p>0110 000 Reserved for contiguous files. The
implementation may treat the rest of the information for
this archive like a regular file. If this file type is
undefined, the implementation may create the file as a
regular file.</p>

<p>This provides for extensibility of the cpio format while
allowing for the ability to read old archives. Files of an
unknown type may be read as &quot;regular files&quot; on
some implementations. On a system that does not support
extended file types, the pax utility should do the best it
can with the file and go on to the next.</p>
