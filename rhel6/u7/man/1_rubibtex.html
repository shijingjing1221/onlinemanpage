<p>NAME rubibtex - make a bibliography for (La)TeX using
Russian letters as item names</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rubibtex BASENAME</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rubibtex is used to run bibtex(1) on
auxiliary files with Russian char- acters in item names
(citation keys). It is part of the T2 package.</p>

<p>rubibtex copies the auxiliary file to /tmp, uses sed(1)
to convert Cyrillic character commands to their 8-bit ASCII
equivalents; runs bib- tex(1) on the modified file; and
finally moves the original auxiliary file back (overwriting
the modified file).</p>

<p>rubibtex assumes that the bibtex(1) database (bib) files
are encoded with the KOI8-R encoding.</p>

<p>FILES basename.aux LaTeX auxiliary file</p>

<p>BUGS None known, but report any bugs found to the
authors.</p>
