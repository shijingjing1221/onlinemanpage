<p>NAME taskset - retrieve or set a processs CPU
affinity</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS taskset [options] mask command [arg]... taskset
[options] -p [mask] pid</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION taskset is used to set or retrieve the CPU
affinity of a running pro- cess given its PID or to launch a
new COMMAND with a given CPU affin- ity. CPU affinity is a
scheduler property that &quot;bonds&quot; a process to a
given set of CPUs on the system. The Linux scheduler will
honor the given CPU affinity and the process will not run on
any other CPUs. Note that the Linux scheduler also supports
natural CPU affinity: the scheduler attempts to keep
processes on the same CPU as long as practi- cal for
performance reasons. Therefore, forcing a specific CPU
affin- ity is useful only in certain applications.</p>

<p>The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the
lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and
the highest order bit corre- sponding to the last logical
CPU. Not all CPUs may exist on a given system but a mask may
specify more CPUs than are present. A retrieved mask will
reflect only the bits that correspond to CPUs physically on
the system. If an invalid mask is given (i.e., one that
corresponds to no valid CPUs on the current system) an error
is returned. The masks are typically given in hexadecimal.
For example,</p>

<p>0x00000001 is processor #0</p>

<p>0x00000003 is processors #0 and #1</p>

<p>0xFFFFFFFF is all processors (#0 through #31)</p>

<p>When taskset returns, it is guaranteed that the given
program has been scheduled to a legal CPU.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p, --pid operate on an existing PID and not
launch a new task</p>

<p>-c, --cpu-list specify a numerical list of processors
instead of a bitmask. The list may contain multiple items,
separated by comma, and ranges. For example, 0,5,7,9-11.</p>

<p>-h, --help display usage information and exit</p>

<p>-V, --version output version information and exit</p>

<p>USAGE The default behavior is to run a new command with
a given affinity mask: taskset mask command [arguments]</p>

<p>You can also retrieve the CPU affinity of an existing
task: taskset -p pid</p>

<p>Or set it: taskset -p mask pid</p>

<p>PERMISSIONS A user can change the CPU affinity of a
process belonging to the same user. A user must possess
CAP_SYS_NICE to change the CPU affinity of a process
belonging to another user. A user can retrieve the affinity
mask of any process.</p>
