<p>SETFONT(8) International Support SETFONT(8)</p>

<p>NAME setfont - load EGA/VGA console screen font</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS setfont [-O font+umap.orig] [-o font.orig] [-om
cmap.orig] [-ou umap.orig] [-N] [font.new ...] [-m cmap] [-u
umap] [-C console] [-hH] [-v] [-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setfont command reads a font from the
file font.new and loads it into the EGA/VGA character
generator, and optionally outputs the previ- ous font. It
can also load various mapping tables and output the pre-
vious versions.</p>

<p>If no args are given (or only the option -N for some
number N), then a default (8xN) font is loaded (see below).
One may give several small fonts, all containing a Unicode
table, and setfont will combine them and load the union.
Typical use:</p>

<p>setfont Load a default font.</p>

<p>setfont drdos8x16 Load a given font (here the 448-glyph
drdos font).</p>

<p>setfont cybercafe -u cybercafe Load a given font that
does not have a Unicode map and provide one explicitly.</p>

<p>setfont LatArCyrHeb-19 -m 8859-2 Load a given font (here
a 512-glyph font combining several char- acter sets) and
indicate that one s local character set is ISO 8859-2.</p>

<p>Note: if a font has more than 256 glyphs, only 8 out of
16 colors can be used simultaneously. It can make console
perception worse (loss of intensity and even some
colors).</p>

<p>FONT FORMATS The standard Linux font format is the PSF
font. It has a header describing font properties like
character size, followed by the glyph bitmaps, optionally
followed by a Unicode mapping table giving the Uni- code
value for each glyph. Several other (obsolete) font formats
are recognized. If the input file has code page format
(probably with suf- fix .cp), containing three fonts with
sizes e.g. 8x8, 8x14 and 8x16, then one of the options -8 or
-14 or -16 must be used to select one. Raw font files are
binary files of size 256*N bytes, containing bit images for
each of 256 characters, one byte per scan line, and N bytes
per character (0 &lt; N &lt;= 32). Most fonts have a width
of 8 bits, but with the framebuffer device (fb) other widths
can be used.</p>

<p>FONT HEIGHT The program setfont has no built-in
knowledge of VGA video modes, but just asks the kernel to
load the character ROM of the video card with certain
bitmaps. However, since Linux 1.3.1 the kernel knows enough
about EGA/VGA video modes to select a different line
distance. The default character height will be the number N
inferred from the font or specified by option. However, the
user can specify a different charac- ter height H using the
-h option.</p>

<p>CONSOLE MAPS Several mappings are involved in the path
from user program output to console display. If the console
is in utf8 mode (see unicode_start(1)) then the kernel
expects that user program output is coded as UTF-8 (see
utf-8(7)), and converts that to Unicode (ucs2). Otherwise, a
transla- tion table is used from the 8-bit program output to
16-bit Unicode val- ues. Such a translation table is called
a Unicode console map. There are four of them: three built
into the kernel, the fourth settable using the -m option of
setfont. An escape sequence chooses between these four
tables; after loading a cmap, setfont will output the escape
sequence Esc ( K that makes it the active translation.</p>

<p>Suitable arguments for the -m option are for example
8859-1, 8859-2, ..., 8859-15, cp437, ..., cp1250.</p>

<p>Given the Unicode value of the symbol to be displayed,
the kernel finds the right glyph in the font using the
Unicode mapping info of the font and displays it.</p>

<p>Old fonts do not have Unicode mapping info, and in order
to handle them there are direct-to-font maps (also loaded
using -m) that give a corre- spondence between user bytes
and font positions. The most common cor- respondence is the
one given in the file trivial (where user byte val- ues are
used directly as font positions). Other correspondences are
sometimes preferable since the PC video hardware expects
line drawing characters in certain font positions.</p>

<p>Giving a -m none argument inhibits the loading and
activation of a map- ping table. The previous console map
can be saved to a file using the -om file option. These
options of setfont render mapscrn(8) obsolete. (However, it
may be useful to read that man page.)</p>

<p>UNICODE FONT MAPS The correspondence between the glyphs
in the font and Unicode values is described by a Unicode
mapping table. Many fonts have a Unicode map- ping table
included in the font file, and an explicit table can be
indicated using the -u option. The program setfont will load
such a Unicode mapping table, unless a -u none argument is
given. The previous Unicode mapping table will be saved as
part of the saved font file when the -O option is used. It
can be saved to a separate file using the -ou file option.
These options of setfont render loadunimap(8) obsolete.</p>

<p>The Unicode mapping table should assign some glyph to
the missing character value U+fffd, otherwise missing
characters are not trans- lated, giving a usually very
confusing result.</p>

<p>Usually no mapping table is needed, and a Unicode
mapping table is already contained in the font (sometimes
this is indicated by the .psfu extension), so that most
users need not worry about the precise meaning and
functioning of these mapping tables.</p>

<p>One may add a Unicode mapping table to a psf font using
psfaddtable(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h H Override font height.</p>

<p>-m file Load console map or Unicode console map from
file.</p>

<p>-o file Save previous font in file.</p>

<p>-O file Save previous font and Unicode map in file.</p>

<p>-om file Store console map in file.</p>

<p>-ou file Save previous Unicode map in file.</p>

<p>-u file Load Unicode table describing the font from
file.</p>

<p>-C console Set the font for the indicated console. (May
require root per- missions.)</p>

<p>-v Be verbose.</p>

<p>-V Print version and exit.</p>

<p>NOTE PC video hardware allows one to use the
&quot;intensity&quot; bit either to indi- cate brightness,
or to address 512 (instead of 256) glyphs in the font. So,
if the font has more than 256 glyphs, the console will be
reduced to 8 (instead of 16) colors.</p>

<p>FILES /lib/kbd/consolefonts is the default font
directory. /lib/kbd/unimaps is the default directory for
Unicode maps. /lib/kbd/consoletrans is the default directory
for screen mappings. The default font is a file default (or
default8xN if the -N option was given for some number N)
perhaps with suitable extension (like .psf).</p>
