<p>BACKTRACE(3) Linux Programmer s Manual BACKTRACE(3)</p>

<p>NAME backtrace, backtrace_symbols, backtrace_symbols_fd
- support for appli- cation self-debugging</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;execinfo.h&gt;</p>

<p>int backtrace(void **buffer, int size);</p>

<p>char **backtrace_symbols(void *const *buffer, int
size);</p>

<p>void backtrace_symbols_fd(void *const *buffer, int size,
int fd);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION backtrace() returns a backtrace for the
calling program, in the array pointed to by buffer. A
backtrace is the series of currently active function calls
for the program. Each item in the array pointed to by buffer
is of type void *, and is the return address from the corre-
sponding stack frame. The size argument specifies the
maximum number of addresses that can be stored in buffer. If
the backtrace is larger than size, then the addresses
corresponding to the size most recent function calls are
returned; to obtain the complete backtrace, make sure that
buffer and size are large enough.</p>

<p>Given the set of addresses returned by backtrace() in
buffer, back- trace_symbols() translates the addresses into
an array of strings that describe the addresses
symbolically. The size argument specifies the number of
addresses in buffer. The symbolic representation of each
address consists of the function name (if this can be
determined), a hexadecimal offset into the function, and the
actual return address (in hexadecimal). The address of the
array of string pointers is returned as the function result
of backtrace_symbols(). This array is mal- loc(3)ed by
backtrace_symbols(), and must be freed by the caller. (The
strings pointed to by the array of pointers need not and
should not be freed.)</p>

<p>backtrace_symbols_fd() takes the same buffer and size
arguments as backtrace_symbols(), but instead of returning
an array of strings to the caller, it writes the strings,
one per line, to the file descriptor fd.
backtrace_symbols_fd() does not call malloc(3), and so can
be employed in situations where the latter function might
fail.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE backtrace() returns the number of addresses
returned in buffer, which is not greater than size. If the
return value is less than size, then the full backtrace was
stored; if it is equal to size, then it may have been
truncated, in which case the addresses of the oldest stack
frames are not returned.</p>

<p>On success, backtrace_symbols() returns a pointer to the
array mal- loc(3)ed by the call; on error, NULL is
returned.</p>

<p>VERSIONS backtrace(), backtrace_symbols(), and
backtrace_symbols_fd() are pro- vided in glibc since version
2.1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO These functions are GNU extensions.</p>

<p>NOTES These functions make some assumptions about how a
functions return address is stored on the stack. Note the
following:</p>

<p>* Omission of the frame pointers (as implied by any of
gcc(1)s non- zero optimization levels) may cause these
assumptions to be vio- lated.</p>

<p>* Inlined functions do not have stack frames.</p>

<p>* Tail-call optimization causes one stack frame to
replace another.</p>

<p>The symbol names may be unavailable without the use of
special linker options. For systems using the GNU linker, it
is necessary to use the -rdynamic linker option. Note that
names of &quot;static&quot; functions are not exposed, and
wont be available in the backtrace.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The program below demonstrates the use of
backtrace() and back- trace_symbols(). The following shell
session shows what we might see when running the
program:</p>

<p>$ cc -rdynamic prog.c -o prog $ ./prog 3 backtrace()
returned 8 addresses ./prog(myfunc3+0x5c) [0x80487f0] ./prog
[0x8048871] ./prog(myfunc+0x21) [0x8048894]
./prog(myfunc+0x1a) [0x804888d] ./prog(myfunc+0x1a)
[0x804888d] ./prog(main+0x65) [0x80488fb]
/lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xdc) [0xb7e38f9c] ./prog
[0x8048711]</p>

<p>Program source</p>

<p>#include &lt;execinfo.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>void myfunc3(void) { int j, nptrs; #define SIZE 100 void
*buffer[100]; char **strings;</p>

<p>nptrs = backtrace(buffer, SIZE);
printf(&quot;backtrace() returned %d addresses0, nptrs);</p>

<p>/* The call backtrace_symbols_fd(buffer, nptrs,
STDOUT_FILENO) would produce similar output to the
following: */</p>

<p>strings = backtrace_symbols(buffer, nptrs); if (strings
== NULL) { perror(&quot;backtrace_symbols&quot;);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>for (j = 0; j &lt; nptrs; j++) printf(&quot;%s0,
strings[j]);</p>

<p>free(strings); }</p>

<p>static void /* &quot;static&quot; means don&rsquo;t
export the symbol... */ myfunc2(void) { myfunc3(); }</p>

<p>void myfunc(int ncalls) { if (ncalls &gt; 1)
myfunc(ncalls - 1); else myfunc2(); }</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc != 2) {
fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s num-calls0, argv[0]);
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }</p>

<p>myfunc(atoi(argv[1])); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>
