<p>NAME mkaf - create a Performance Co-Pilot archive
folio</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/mkaf [findopts] filename
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A collection of one or more Performance
Co-Pilot (see PCPIntro(1)) archive logs may be combined with
mkaf to produce a PCP archive folio and the associated
archive folio control file. Some PCP tools use mkaf to
create archive folios, e.g. the record facility in the
pmchart(1) and pmview(1) tools, to facilitate playback with
pmafm(1).</p>

<p>mkaf processes each filename argument, and if this is a
component file from a PCP archive that archive is added to
the folio.</p>

<p>If filename is a directory, then this is searched
recursively using find(1). Any filename argument beginning
with a - is assumed to be a find(1) command line option
(findopts); the default is -follow if no findopts are
specified.</p>

<p>The first named archive in the folio is assumed to be
associated with the default host for any tool that tries to
replay multiple archives from the folio.</p>

<p>The folio control file is written to standard output,
and has the fol- lowing format.</p>

<p>1. The first line contains the word PCPFolio.</p>

<p>2. The second line contains the tag Version: followed by
the format version number (currently 1).</p>

<p>3. For subsequent lines, blank lines and lines beginning
with # are ignored.</p>

<p>4. The line beginning with the tag Created: documents
where and when the folio was created.</p>

<p>5. The line beginning with the tag Creator: identifies
the tool which created the folio (and is assumed to know how
to replay the archive folio). If present, the second
argument is the name of a configura- tion file that the
creator tool could use to replay the archive folio, e.g.
with the replay command for pmafm(1). In the case of mkaf
(unlike pmchart(1) or pmview(1)) there is no knowledge of
the contents of the archives, so the creator cannot replay
the archive, however pmchart(1) is able to replay any
archive, and so this tool is identified as the Creator: for
archive folios created by mkaf(1).</p>

<p>6. This is then followed by one or more lines beginning
with the tag Archive: followed by the hostname and base name
of the archive.</p>

<p>For example $ mkaf mydir/gonzo might produce the
following folio control file.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO find(1), PCPIntro(1), pmafm(1), pmchart(1),
pmview(1), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Some informational messages, warnings and
pathological conditions are reported on standard error.</p>
