<p>STRUCT IRB(9) The ccw bus STRUCT IRB(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_irb - interruption response block</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct irb { union scsw scsw; union esw; __u8
ecw[32]; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS scsw subchannel status word</p>

<p>esw extened status word</p>

<p>ecw[32] extended control word</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The irb that is handed to the device driver
when an interrupt occurs. For solicited interrupts, the
common I/O layer already performs checks whether a field is
valid; a field not being valid is always passed as 0. If a
unit check occured, ecw may contain sense data; this is
retrieved by the common I/O layer itself if the device
doesn&acute;t support concurrent sense (so that the device
driver never needs to perform basic sene itself). For
unsolicited interrupts, the irb is passed as-is (expect for
sense data, if applicable).</p>
