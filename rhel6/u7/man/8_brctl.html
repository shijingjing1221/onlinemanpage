<p>NAME brctl - ethernet bridge administration</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS brctl [command]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION brctl is used to set up, maintain, and
inspect the ethernet bridge con- figuration in the linux
kernel.</p>

<p>An ethernet bridge is a device commonly used to connect
different net- works of ethernets together, so that these
ethernets will appear as one ethernet to the
participants.</p>

<p>Each of the ethernets being connected corresponds to one
physical interface in the bridge. These individual ethernets
are bundled into one bigger ( logical ) ethernet, this
bigger ethernet corresponds to the bridge network
interface.</p>

<p>INSTANCES The command brctl addbr &lt;name&gt; creates a
new instance of the ethernet bridge. The network interface
corresponding to the bridge will be called &lt;name&gt;.</p>

<p>The command brctl delbr &lt;name&gt; deletes the
instance &lt;name&gt; of the eth- ernet bridge. The network
interface corresponding to the bridge must be down before it
can be deleted!</p>

<p>The command brctl show shows all current instances of
the ethernet bridge.</p>

<p>PORTS Each bridge has a number of ports attached to it.
Network traffic com- ing in on any of these ports will be
forwarded to the other ports transparently, so that the
bridge is invisible to the rest of the net- work (i.e. it
will not show up in traceroute(8) ).</p>

<p>The command brctl addif &lt;brname&gt; &lt;ifname&gt;
will make the interface &lt;ifname&gt; a port of the bridge
&lt;brname&gt;. This means that all frames received on
&lt;ifname&gt; will be processed as if destined for the
bridge. Also, when sending frames on &lt;brname&gt;,
&lt;ifname&gt; will be considered as a potential output
interface.</p>

<p>The command brctl delif &lt;brname&gt; &lt;ifname&gt;
will detach the interface &lt;ifname&gt; from the bridge
&lt;brname&gt;.</p>

<p>The command brctl show &lt;brname&gt; will show some
information on the bridge and its attached ports.</p>

<p>AGEING The bridge keeps track of ethernet addresses seen
on each port. When it needs to forward a frame, and it
happens to know on which port the des- tination ethernet
address (specified in the frame) is located, it can cheat by
forwarding the frame to that port only, thus saving a lot of
redundant copies and transmits.</p>

<p>However, the ethernet address location data is not
static data. Machines can move to other ports, network cards
can be replaced (which changes the machines ethernet
address), etc.</p>

<p>brctl showmacs &lt;brname&gt; shows a list of learned
MAC addresses for this bridge.</p>

<p>brctl setageingtime &lt;brname&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
ethernet (MAC) address ageing time, in seconds. After
&lt;time&gt; seconds of not having seen a frame coming from
a certain address, the bridge will time out (delete) that
address from the Forwarding DataBase (fdb).</p>

<p>brctl setgcint &lt;brname&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
garbage collection interval for the bridge &lt;brname&gt; to
&lt;time&gt; seconds. This means that the bridge will check
the forwarding database for timed out entries every
&lt;time&gt; sec- onds.</p>

<p>SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL Multiple ethernet bridges can
work together to create even larger net- works of ethernets
using the IEEE 802.1d spanning tree protocol. This protocol
is used for finding the shortest path between two ethernets,
and for eliminating loops from the topology. As this
protocol is a standard, linux bridges will interwork
properly with other third party bridge products. Bridges
communicate with eachother by sending and receiving BPDUs
(Bridge Protocol Data Units). These BPDUs can be recog-
nised by an ethernet destination address of
01:80:c2:00:00:00.</p>

<p>The spanning tree protocol can also be turned off (for
those situations where it just doesnt make sense, for
example when this linux box is the only bridge on the LAN,
or when you know that there are no loops in the
topology.)</p>

<p>brctl(8) can be used for configuring certain spanning
tree protocol parameters. For an explanation of these
parameters, see the IEEE 802.1d specification (or send me an
email). The default values should be just fine. If you dont
know what these parameters mean, you probably wont feel the
desire to tweak them.</p>

<p>brctl stp &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;state&gt; controls this
bridge instances participa- tion in the spanning tree
protocol. If &lt;state&gt; is &quot;on&quot; or
&quot;yes&quot; the STP will be turned on, otherwise it will
be turned off. When turned off, the bridge will not send or
receive BPDUs, and will thus not partici- pate in the
spanning tree protocol. If your bridge isn t the only bridge
on the LAN, or if there are loops in the LANs topology, DO
NOT turn this option off. If you turn this option off,
please know what you are doing.</p>

<p>brctl setbridgeprio &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;priority&gt; sets
the bridges priority to &lt;priority&gt;. The priority value
is an unsigned 16-bit quantity (a number between 0 and
65535), and has no dimension. Lower priority values are
better. The bridge with the lowest priority will be elected
root bridge.</p>

<p>brctl setfd &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the bridge
s bridge forward delay to &lt;time&gt; seconds.</p>

<p>brctl sethello &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
bridge s bridge hello time to &lt;time&gt; seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setmaxage &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
bridges maximum message age to &lt;time&gt; seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setpathcost &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;port&gt;
&lt;cost&gt; sets the port cost of the port &lt;port&gt; to
&lt;cost&gt;. This is a dimensionless metric.</p>

<p>brctl setportprio &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;port&gt;
&lt;priority&gt; sets the port &lt;port&gt;s priority to
&lt;priority&gt;. The priority value is an unsigned 8-bit
quan- tity (a number between 0 and 255), and has no
dimension. This metric is used in the designated port and
root port selection algorithms.</p>

<p>brctl sethashel &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;int&gt; sets the hash
elasticity to &lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>brctl sethashmax &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;int&gt; sets hash
max to &lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>brctl setmclmc &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;int&gt; sets the
multicast last member count to &lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>brctl setmcrouter &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;int&gt; sets
multicast router to &lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>brctl setmcsnoop &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;int&gt; sets
multicast snooping to &lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>brctl setmcsqc &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;int&gt; sets the
multicast startup query count to &lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>brctl setmclmi &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
multicast last member inter- val to &lt;time&gt;
seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setmcmi &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
multicast membership interval to &lt;time&gt; seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setmcqpi &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
multicast querier interval to &lt;time&gt; seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setmcqi &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
multicast query interval to &lt;time&gt; seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setmcqri &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
multicast query response interval to &lt;time&gt;
seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setmcqri &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;time&gt; sets the
multicast startup query inter- val to &lt;time&gt;
seconds.</p>

<p>brctl setportmcrouter &lt;bridge&gt; &lt;port&gt;
&lt;int&gt; sets port &lt;port&gt; for multi- cast router
&lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>NOTES brctl(8) replaces the older brcfg tool.</p>
