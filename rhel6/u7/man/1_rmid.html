<p>Name rmid - The Java RMI Activation System Daemon</p>

<p>rmid starts the activation system daemon that allows
objects to be reg- istered and activated in a virtual
machine (VM).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rmid [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rmid tool starts the activation system
daemon. The activation sys- tem daemon must be started
before activatable objects can be either registered with the
activation system or activated in a VM. See the Java RMI
Specification @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/rmi/spec/rmiTOC.html
and Activation tutorials @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/activa-
tion/overview.html for details on how to write programs that
use acti- vatable remote objects.</p>

<p>The daemon can be started by executing the rmid command,
and specifying a security policy file, as follows:</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy</p>

<p>Note: When running Suns implementation of rmid, by
default you will need to specify a security policy file so
that rmid can verify whether or not the information in each
ActivationGroupDesc is allowed to be used to launch a VM for
an activation group. Specifically, the command and options
specified by the CommandEnvironment and any Properties
passed to an ActivationGroupDescs constructor must now be
explicitly allowed in the security policy file for rmid. The
value of the sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property dictates
the policy that rmid uses to determine whether or not the
information in an Activation- GroupDesc may be used to
launch a VM for an activation group.</p>

<p>Executing rmid by default</p>

<p>o starts the Activator and an internal registry on the
default port, 1098, and</p>

<p>o binds an ActivationSystem to the name
java.rmi.activation.Activa- tionSystem in this internal
registry.</p>

<p>To specify an alternate port for the registry, you must
specify the -port option when starting up rmid. For
example,</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy -port 1099</p>

<p>starts the activation system daemon and a registry on
the registrys default port, 1099.</p>

<p>Starting rmid from inetd/xinetd An alternative to
starting rmid from the command line is to configure inetd
(Solaris) or xinetd (Linux) to start rmid on demand.</p>

<p>When rmid starts up, it attempts to obtain an inherited
channel (inher- ited from inetd/xinetd) by invoking the
System.inheritedChannel method. If the inherited channel is
null or not an instance of java.nio.chan-
nels.ServerSocketChannel, then rmid assumes that it was not
started by inetd/xinetd, and it starts up as described
above.</p>

<p>If the inherited channel is a ServerSocketChannel
instance, then rmid uses the java.net.ServerSocket obtained
from the ServerSocketChannel as the server socket that
accepts requests for the remote objects it exports, namely
the registry in which the java.rmi.activation.Activa-
tionSystem is bound and the java.rmi.activation.Activator
remote object. In this mode, rmid behaves the same as when
it is started from the command line, except:</p>

<p>o Output printed to System.err is redirected to a file.
This file is located in the directory specified by the
java.io.tmpdir system property (typically /var/tmp or /tmp)
with the prefix &quot;rmid-err&quot; and the suffix
&quot;tmp&quot;.</p>

<p>o The -port option is disallowed. If this option is
specified, rmid will exit with an error message.</p>

<p>o The -log option is required. If this option is not
specified, rmid will exit with an error message.</p>

<p>See the man pages for inetd (Solaris) or xinetd (Linux)
for details on how to configure services to be started on
demand.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C&lt;someCommandLineOption&gt; Specifies an
option that is passed as a command-line argument to each
child process (activation group) of rmid when that process
is created. For example, you could pass a property to each
vir- tual machine spawned by the activation system
daemon:</p>

<p>rmid -C-Dsome.property=value</p>

<p>This ability to pass command-line arguments to child
processes can be useful for debugging. For example, the
following command:</p>

<p>rmid -C-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true</p>

<p>will enable server-call logging in all child VMs.</p>

<p>-J&lt;someCommandLineOption&gt; Specifies an option that
is passed to the java interpreter run- ning rmid. For
example, to specify that rmid use a policy file named
rmid.policy, the -J option can be used to define the
java.security.policy property on rmids command line, for
exam- ple:</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy</p>

<p>-J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=&lt;policy&gt;
Specifies the policy that rmid employs to check commands and
com- mand-line options used to launch the VM in which an
activation group runs. Please note that this option exists
only in Suns implementation of the Java RMI activation
daemon. If this prop- erty is not specified on the command
line, the result is the same as if
-J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=default were specified.
The possible values of &lt;policy&gt; can be default,
&lt;policyClass- Name&gt;, or none:</p>

<p>o default (or if this property is unspecified)</p>

<p>The default execPolicy allows rmid to execute commands
with spe- cific command-line options only if rmid has been
granted permis- sion to execute those commands and options
in the security policy file that rmid uses. Only the default
activation group implemen- tation can be used with the
default execution policy.</p>

<p>rmid launches a VM for an activation group using the
information in the group s registered activation group
descriptor, an Activa- tionGroupDesc. The group descriptor
specifies an optional Activa-
tionGroupDesc.CommandEnvironment which includes the command
to execute to start the activation group as well as any
command line options to be added to the command line. By
default, rmid uses the java command found in java.home. The
group descriptor also contains properties overrides that are
added to the command line as options defined as:</p>

<p>-D&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</p>

<p>The permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission is used
to grant rmid permission to execute a command, specified in
the group descriptor s CommandEnvironment to launch an
activation group. The permission
com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission is used to allow rmid
to use command-line options, specified as properties
overrides in the group descriptor or as options in the
CommandEn- vironment, when launching the activation
group.</p>

<p>When granting rmid permission to execute various
commands and options, the permissions ExecPermission and
ExecOptionPermission need to be granted universally (i.e.,
granted to all code sources).</p>

<p>ExecPermission The ExecPermission class represents
permission for rmid to execute a specific command to launch
an activation group.</p>

<p>Syntax The name of an ExecPermission is the path name of
a command to grant rmid permission to execute. A path name
that ends in &quot;/*&quot; indicates all the files
contained in that directory (where &quot;/&quot; is the
file-separator character, File.separator- Char). A path name
that ends with &quot;/-&quot; indicates all files and
subdirectories contained in that directory (recursively). A
path name consisting of the special token &quot;&lt;&lt;ALL
FILES&gt;&gt;&quot; matches any file.</p>

<p>Note: A path name consisting of a single &quot;*&quot;
indicates all the files in the current directory, while a
path name consisting of a single &quot;-&quot; indicates all
the files in the current direc- tory and (recursively) all
files and subdirectories contained in the current
directory.</p>

<p>ExecOptionPermission The ExecOptionPermission class
represents permission for rmid to use a specific
command-line option when launching an activation group. The
name of an ExecOptionPermission is the value of a command
line option.</p>

<p>Syntax Options support a limited wildcard scheme. An
asterisk signi- fies a wildcard match, and it may appear as
the option name itself (i.e., it matches any option), or an
asterisk may appear at the end of the option name only if
the asterisk fol- lows either a &quot;.&quot; or
&quot;=&quot;.</p>

<p>For example: &quot;*&quot; or &quot;-Dfoo.*&quot; or
&quot;-Da.b.c=*&quot; is valid, &quot;*foo&quot; or
&quot;-Da*b&quot; or &quot;ab*&quot; is not.</p>

<p>Policy file for rmid When granting rmid permission to
execute various commands and options, the permissions
ExecPermission and ExecOption- Permission need to be granted
universally (i.e., granted to all code sources). It is safe
to grant these permissions universally because only rmid
checks these permissions.</p>

<p>An example policy file that grants various execute
permissions to rmid is:</p>

<p>grant { permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
&quot;/files/apps/java/jdk1.7.0/solaris/bin/java&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
&quot;/files/apps/rmidcmds/*&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
&quot;-Djava.security.policy=/files/policies/group.policy&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
&quot;-Djava.security.debug=*&quot;;</p>

<p>permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
&quot;-Dsun.rmi.*&quot;; };</p>

<p>The first permission granted allow rmid to execute the
1.7.0 version of the java command, specified by its explicit
path name. Note that by default, the version of the java
command found in java.home is used (the same one that rmid
uses), and does not need to be specified in the policy file.
The second permission allows rmid to execute any command in
the directory /files/apps/rmidcmds.</p>

<p>The third permission granted, an ExecOptionPermission,
allows rmid to launch an activation group that defines the
security policy file to be /files/policies/group.policy. The
next per- mission allows the java.security.debug property to
be used by an activation group. The last permission allows
any property in the sun.rmi property name hierarchy to be
used by activa- tion groups.</p>

<p>To start rmid with a policy file, the
java.security.policy property needs to be specified on rmid
s command line, for example:</p>

<p>rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy</p>

<p>o &lt;policyClassName&gt;</p>

<p>If the default behavior is not flexible enough, an
administrator can provide, when starting rmid, the name of a
class whose check- ExecCommand method is executed in order
to check commands to be executed by rmid.</p>

<p>The policyClassName specifies a public class with a
public, no-argument constructor and an implementation of the
following checkExecCommand method:</p>

<p>public void checkExecCommand(ActivationGroupDesc desc,
String[] command) throws SecurityException;</p>

<p>Before launching an activation group, rmid calls the
policys checkExecCommand method, passing it the activation
group descrip- tor and an array containing the complete
command to launch the activation group. If the
checkExecCommand throws a SecurityExcep- tion, rmid will not
launch the activation group and an Activa- tionException
will be thrown to the caller attempting to activate the
object.</p>

<p>o none</p>

<p>If the sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property value is
&quot;none&quot;, then rmid will not perform any validation
of commands to launch activation groups.</p>

<p>-log dir Specifies the name of the directory the
activation system daemon uses to write its database and
associated information. The log directory defaults to
creating a directory, log, in the directory in which the
rmid command was executed.</p>

<p>-port port Specifies the port rmid s registry uses. The
activation system daemon binds the ActivationSystem, with
the name java.rmi.activa- tion.ActivationSystem, in this
registry. Thus, the ActivationSys- tem on the local machine
can be obtained using the following Nam- ing.lookup method
call:</p>

<p>import java.rmi.*; import java.rmi.activation.*;</p>

<p>ActivationSystem system; system = (ActivationSystem)
Naming.lookup(&quot;//:port/java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem&quot;);</p>

<p>-stop Stops the current invocation of rmid, for a port
specified by the -port option. If no port is specified, it
will stop the rmid run- ning on port 1098.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CLASSPATH Used to provide the
system a path to user-defined classes. Direc- tories are
separated by colons. For example:</p>

<p>.:/usr/local/java/classes</p>
