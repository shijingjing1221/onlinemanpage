<p>GETHOSTNAME(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
GETHOSTNAME(2)</p>

<p>NAME gethostname, sethostname - get/set hostname</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gethostname(char *name, size_t len); int
sethostname(const char *name, size_t len);</p>

<p>Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
feature_test_macros(7)):</p>

<p>gethostname(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500
sethostname(): _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE &amp;&amp;
_XOPEN_SOURCE &lt; 500)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These system calls are used to access or to
change the hostname of the current processor.</p>

<p>sethostname() sets the hostname to the value given in
the character array name. The len argument specifies the
number of bytes in name. (Thus, name does not require a
terminating null byte.)</p>

<p>gethostname() returns the null-terminated hostname in
the character array name, which has a length of len bytes.
If the null-terminated hostname is too large to fit, then
the name is truncated, and no error is returned (but see
NOTES below). POSIX.1-2001 says that if such truncation
occurs, then it is unspecified whether the returned buffer
includes a terminating null byte.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT name is an invalid address.</p>

<p>EINVAL len is negative or, for sethostname(), len is
larger than the maximum allowed size.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG (glibc gethostname()) len is smaller than
the actual size. (Before version 2.1, glibc uses EINVAL for
this case.)</p>

<p>EPERM For sethostname(), the caller did not have the
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.4BSD (these interfaces first
appeared in 4.2BSD). POSIX.1-2001 specifies gethostname()
but not sethostname().</p>

<p>NOTES SUSv2 guarantees that &quot;Host names are limited
to 255 bytes&quot;. POSIX.1-2001 guarantees that &quot;Host
names (not including the terminating null byte) are limited
to HOST_NAME_MAX bytes&quot;. On Linux, HOST_NAME_MAX is
defined with the value 64, which has been the limit since
Linux 1.0 (earlier kernels imposed a limit of 8 bytes).</p>

<p>Glibc Notes The GNU C library does not employ the
gethostname() system call; instead, it implements
gethostname() as a library function that calls uname(2) and
copies up to len bytes from the returned nodename field into
name. Having performed the copy, the function then checks if
the length of the nodename was greater than or equal to len,
and if it is, then the function returns -1 with errno set to
ENAMETOOLONG; in this case, no null-terminator is included
in the returned name.</p>

<p>Versions of glibc before 2.2 handle the case where the
length of the nodename was greater than or equal to len
differently: nothing is copied into name and the function
returns -1 with errno set to ENAME- TOOLONG.</p>
