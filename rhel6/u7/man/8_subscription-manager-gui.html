<p>NAME subscription-manager-gui - Launches the UI client
of the Subscription Manager.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS subscription-manager-gui [--register]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION subscription-manager-gui opens the local
client tool to manage sub- scriptions and installed products
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. The same tasks that can
be performed by invoking subscription-manager can be
performed in the GUI, including registering systems with a
sub- scription management service, applying and removing
subscriptions, and viewing the subscription status of
installed products.</p>

<p>The Subscription Manager UI can also be opened by
selecting the Red Hat Subscription Manager item from the
Applications &gt; System Tools menu in RHEL 5.x or the
System &gt; Administration menu in RHEL 6.x.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --register If a system has not yet been
registered, then the GUI registra- tion page can be opened
immediately, as the Subscription Manager GUI comes up. This
is only relevant for unregistered systems; if this is used
after a system is registered, the option is ignored.</p>

<p>REFERENCES For procedures and tasks that can be
performed in the Subscription Man- ager UI, check the Gnome
help files (by pressing &lt;F1&gt;) or refer to the RHEL
Subscription Management Guide at
&lt;https://access.redhat.com/knowl-
edge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1.0/html/Subscrip-
tion_Management_Guide/index.html&gt;.</p>
