<p>NAME ppm3d - convert two PPM images into an anaglyph
(red/blue 3d glasses) PPM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppm3d [-color] [-offset=horizontal_offset]
leftppmfile rightppmfile</p>

<p>Deprecated optional 3rd argument: horizontal_offset</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppm3d reads two PPM images as input and produces a PPM
as output, with the images overlapping by the specified
number of pixels in blue- green/red format. The idea is that
if you look at the image with 3-D glasses (glasses that
admit only red through one eye and only green or blue
through the other), you see an image with depth. This is
called an anaglyph stereogram.</p>

<p>ppm3d can produce either of two kinds of anaglyph
stereogram: monochrome or color. Use the -color option to
choose.</p>

<p>In the monochrome version, ppm3d ignores any color
(actually, chromi- nance) in the input images and produces a
result which is monochrome. Viewed through red-green glasses
it is yellow, but without any other color in the field, your
brain tends to see it as grayscale.</p>

<p>In the color version, ppm3d generates a result which is
close to the color of the original. Its not great, though,
due to the fact that each eye necessarily cannot see the
entire spectrum. Red and cyan don t work well, but most
other colors -- especially when heavily satu- rated -- come
out quite well.</p>

<p>To view a color analgyph stereogram, you need glasses
with a left lens that admits only red light and a right lens
that admits only blue and green light. (The right lens may
be called a cyan lens because that is its pigment in white
light; dont be misled into thinking that cyan is the only
color that gets through it). Your brain is wired so that
even though the components of light are coming in through
different eyes, they mix in your brain to form the same
sensation as if you were look- ing at the combined light
with both eyes.</p>

<p>The input PPMs must be the same dimensions.</p>

<p>To make a different kind of stereogram, use
pamstereogram. That makes a steregram that you view without
special glasses, just by letting your eyes unfocus so that
each eye sees different parts of the image.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS The mandatory arguments are file names of the
left and right input images.</p>

<p>An optional third argument specifies the same thing as
the value of the -offset argument, but is deprecated because
-offset is easier to use and read. Before Netpbm 10.38
(March 2007), this third argument is the only way to specify
the offset.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -offset=horizontal_offset This option indicates
the amount, in pixels, by which the left and image is offset
to the right of the right image in the output.</p>

<p>The effect of this option is to move the entire image
forward (positive numbers) or backward (negative numbers).
With a zero offset, the main subject of the picture appears
in the plane of the picture (i.e. if the image is projected
on a screen, the location of the screen). The main subject
is the subject at the location where the line of sight of
the left camera intersects the line of sight of the right
camera -- the main subject appears at the same location in
both the left and right images.</p>

<p>Default is zero.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007). Before
that, use the third argument instead. Also, before Netpbm
10.38 the default is +30 pixels.</p>

<p>-color This option causes ppm3d to generate a color
anaglyph stere- ogram. By default, it generates
monochrome.</p>

<p>This option was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).</p>
