<p>Uil(library call) Uil(library call)</p>

<p>NAME Uil Invokes the UIL compiler from within an
application</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;uil/UilDef.h&gt;</p>

<p>Uil_status_type Uil( Uil_command_type *command_desc,
Uil_compile_desc_type **compile_desc, Uil_continue_type
(*message_cb) (), char *message_data, Uil_continue_type
(*status_cb) (), char *status_data);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Uil function provides a callable entry
point for the UIL compiler. The Uil callable interface can
be used to process a UIL source file and to generate UID
files, as well as return a detailed description of the UIL
source module in the form of a symbol table (parse
tree).</p>

<p>command_desc Specifies the uil command line.</p>

<p>compile_desc Returns the results of the compilation.</p>

<p>message_cb Specifies a callback function that is called
when the com- piler encounters errors in the UIL source.</p>

<p>message_data Specifies user data that is passed to the
message callback function (message_cb). Note that this
argument is not inter- preted by UIL, and is used
exclusively by the calling appli- cation.</p>

<p>status_cb Specifies a callback function that is called
to allow X applications to service X events such as updating
the screen. This function is called at various check points,
which have been hard coded into the UIL compiler. The sta-
tus_update_delay argument in command_desc specifies the num-
ber of check points to be passed before the status_cb func-
tion is invoked.</p>

<p>status_data Specifies user data that is passed to the
status callback function (status_cb). Note that this
argument is not inter- preted by the UIL compiler and is
used exclusively by the calling application.</p>

<p>Following are the data structures Uil_command_type and
Uil_com- pile_desc_type:</p>

<p>typedef struct Uil_command_type { char *source_file; /*
single source to compile */ char *resource_file; /* name of
output file */ char *listing_file; /* name of listing file
*/ unsigned int *include_dir_count; /* number of dirs. in
include_dir */ char *((*include_dir) []); /* dir. to search
for include files */ unsigned listing_file_flag: 1; /*
produce a listing */ unsigned resource_file_flag: 1; /*
generate UID output */ unsigned machine_code_flag: 1; /*
generate machine code */ unsigned report_info_msg_flag: 1;
/* report info messages */ unsigned report_warn_msg_flag: 1;
/* report warnings */ unsigned parse_tree_flag: 1; /*
generate parse tree */ unsigned int status_update_delay; /*
number of times a status point is */ /* passed before
calling status_cb */ /* function 0 means called every time
*/ char *database; /* name of database file */ unsigned
database_flag: 1; /* read a new database file */ unsigned
use_setlocale_flag: 1; /* enable calls to setlocale */ };
typedef struct Uil_compile_desc_type { unsigned int
compiler_version; /* version number of compiler */ unsigned
int data_version; /* version number of structures */ char
*parse_tree_root; /* parse tree output */ unsigned int
message_count [Uil_k_max_status+1]; /* array of severity
counts */ };</p>

<p>Following is a description of the message callback
function specified by message_cb:</p>

<p>Uil_continue_type (*message_cb) (message_data,
message_number, severity, msg_buffer, src_buffer,
ptr_buffer, loc_buffer, message_count) char *message_data;
int message_number; int severity; char *msg_buffer,
*src_buffer; char *ptr_buffer, *loc_buffer; int
message_count[];</p>

<p>This function specifies a callback function that UIL
invokes instead of printing an error message when the
compiler encounters an error in the UIL source. The callback
should return one of the following values:</p>

<p>Uil_k_terminate Terminate processing of the source
file</p>

<p>Uil_k_continue Continue processing the source file</p>

<p>The arguments are</p>

<p>message_data Data supplied by the application as the
message_data argument to the Uil function. UIL does not
interpret this data in any way; it just passes it to the
callback.</p>

<p>message_number An index into a table of error messages
and severities for internal use by UIL.</p>

<p>severity An integer that indicates the severity of the
error. The possible values are the status constants returned
by the Uil function. See Return Value for more
information.</p>

<p>msg_buffer A string that describes the error.</p>

<p>src_buffer A string consisting of the source line where
the error occurred. This string is not always available. In
this case, the argument is NULL.</p>

<p>ptr_buffer A string consisting of whitespace and a
printing character in the character position corresponding
to the column of the source line where the error occurred.
This string may be printed beneath the source line to
provide a visual indica- tion of the column where the error
occurred. This string is not always available. In this case,
the argument is NULL.</p>

<p>loc_buffer A string identifying the line number and file
of the source line where the error occurred. This is not
always available; the argument is then NULL.</p>

<p>message_count An array of integers containing the number
of diagnostic mes- sages issued thus far for each severity
level. To find the number of messages issued for the current
severity level, use the severity argument as the index into
this array.</p>

<p>Following is a description of the status callback
function specified by status_cb:</p>

<p>Uil_continue_type (*status_cb) (status_data,
percent_complete, lines_processed, current_file,
message_count) char *status_data; int percent_complete; int
lines_processed; char *current_file; int
message_count[];</p>

<p>This function specifies a callback function that is
invoked to allow X applications to service X events such as
updating the screen. The callback should return one of the
following values:</p>

<p>Uil_k_terminate Terminate processing of the source
file</p>

<p>Uil_k_continue Continue processing the source file</p>

<p>The arguments are</p>

<p>status_data Data supplied by the application as the
status_data argument to the Uil function. UIL does not
interpret this data in any way; it just passes it to the
callback.</p>

<p>percent_complete An integer indicating what percentage
of the current source file has been processed so far.</p>

<p>lines_processed An integer indicating how many lines of
the current source file have been read so far.</p>

<p>current_file A string containing the pathname of the
current source file.</p>

<p>message_count An array of integers containing the number
of diagnostic mes- sages issued thus far for each severity
level. To find the number of messages issued for a given
severity level, use the severity level as the index into
this array. The possible severity levels are the status
constants returned by the Uil function. See Return Value for
more information.</p>

<p>RETURN This function returns one of the following status
return constants:</p>

<p>Uil_k_success_status The operation succeeded.</p>

<p>Uil_k_info_status The operation succeeded. An
informational message is returned.</p>

<p>Uil_k_warning_status The operation succeeded. A warning
message is returned.</p>

<p>Uil_k_error_status The operation failed due to an
error.</p>

<p>Uil_k_severe_status The operation failed due to an
error.</p>
