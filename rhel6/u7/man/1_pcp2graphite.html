<p>NAME pcp2graphite - pcp-to-graphite data pump</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pcp2graphite [-h HOST] [-t DELTA] [-g
GRAPHITEHOST] [-p PICKLEPORT] [-P TEXTPORT] [-u UNITS] [-m
PREFIX] metricname ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The program pcp2graphite is PCP monitor /
data exporter program based on the Python PMAPI bindings. It
relays whole hierarchies of the PMNS to a designated
Graphite (Carbon/Whisper) database by periodically polling,
then copying/converting relevant numerical metrics across
the Graphite &quot;text&quot; or &quot;pickled&quot; TCP
protocols. Metric values are option- ally scaled to a given
unit/scale, but are not rate-converted. Metric names may be
prefixed and are somewhat canonicalized to fit the Graphite
namespace rules. One-shot conversion runs such as from
archives are not currently supported.</p>

<p>The data transfer will continue on a best-effort basis
until the pro- gram is interrupted. Temporary errors are
ignored. Multiple copies of this program may be run in
parallel, to populate different Graphite databases or
subtrees, with different scaling or sampling intervals.</p>

<p>-h HOST Specify the PMCD server where PCP metrics are to
be extracted from. Default local:.</p>

<p>-t DELTA Specify the polling interval in seconds.
Polling is aligned to natural multiples of this interval.
Default 60.</p>

<p>-g GRAPHITEHOST Specify the graphite carbon-cache server
where the relayed data is to be relayed. Default
localhost.</p>

<p>-p PICKLEPORT Select the more efficient
&quot;pickled&quot; encoding for carbon-cache communication,
and use the given TCP port. This is default, using port
2004.</p>

<p>-P TEXTPORT Select the less efficient &quot;text&quot;
encoding for carbon-cache com- munication, and use the given
TCP port. This protocol is not default, because it requires
a separate TCP connection for each metric. The typical port
is 2003.</p>

<p>-u UNITS Rescale the metrics to the given UNITS string,
as parsed by the pmParseUnitsStr function. This must be
dimensionally consistent with the underlying PCP metric.
Default is no scaling.</p>

<p>-m PREFIX Use the given string as a prefix for all PMNS
metrics relayed to Graphite. Default is pcp. (note the
period at the end).</p>

<p>metricname ... Relay all numeric metrics nested at or
below the given name in the PMNS. This option may be
repeated. This is a compulsory option, having no
default.</p>
