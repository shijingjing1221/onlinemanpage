<p>SIGWAIT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SIGWAIT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sigwait - wait for queued signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigwait(const sigset_t *restrict set, int *restrict
sig);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sigwait() function shall select a
pending signal from set, atomi- cally clear it from the
system s set of pending signals, and return that signal
number in the location referenced by sig. If prior to the
call to sigwait() there are multiple pending instances of a
single sig- nal number, it is implementation-defined whether
upon successful return there are any remaining pending
signals for that signal number. If the implementation
supports queued signals and there are multiple signals
queued for the signal number selected, the first such queued
signal shall cause a return from sigwait() and the remainder
shall remain queued. If no signal in set is pending at the
time of the call, the thread shall be suspended until one or
more becomes pending. The sig- nals defined by set shall
have been blocked at the time of the call to sigwait();
otherwise, the behavior is undefined. The effect of sig-
wait() on the signal actions for the signals in set is
unspecified.</p>

<p>If more than one thread is using sigwait() to wait for
the same signal, no more than one of these threads shall
return from sigwait() with the signal number. Which thread
returns from sigwait() if more than a sin- gle thread is
waiting is unspecified.</p>

<p>Should any of the multiple pending signals in the range
SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected, it shall be the lowest
numbered one. The selec- tion order between realtime and
non-realtime signals, or between multi- ple pending
non-realtime signals, is unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, sigwait() shall
store the signal number of the received signal at the
location referenced by sig and return zero. Otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sigwait() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The set argument contains an invalid or
unsupported signal num- ber.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE To provide a convenient way for a thread to
wait for a signal, this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
provides the sigwait() function. For most cases where a
thread has to wait for a signal, the sigwait() func- tion
should be quite convenient, efficient, and adequate.</p>

<p>However, requests were made for a lower-level primitive
than sigwait() and for semaphores that could be used by
threads. After some consider- ation, threads were allowed to
use semaphores and sem_post() was defined to be async-signal
and async-cancel-safe.</p>

<p>In summary, when it is necessary for code run in
response to an asyn- chronous signal to notify a thread,
sigwait() should be used to handle the signal.
Alternatively, if the implementation provides semaphores,
they also can be used, either following sigwait() or from
within a sig- nal handling routine previously registered
with sigaction().</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
