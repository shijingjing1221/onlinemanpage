<p>NAME groff_www - groff macros for authoring web
pages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -mwww [ options ] file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the GNU -mwww
macro package, which is part of the groff document
formatting system. The manual page is very a basic guide,
and the html device driver (grohtml) has been completely
rewritten but still remains as in an alpha state. It has
been included into the distribution so that a lot of people
have a chance to test it. Note that this macro file will be
automatically called (via the troffrc file) if you use
-Thtml.</p>

<p>To see the hyperlinks in action, please format this man
page with the grohtml device.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the functions found in this macro
set. .HX automatic heading level cut off; $1 point for
sections/headers .BCL specify colours on a web page .BGIMG
specify background image .URL create a url using two
parameters .FTP create an ftp reference .MTO create a html
email address .FTP create an ftp reference .TAG generate an
html name .IMG include an image file .PIMG include png image
.MPIMG place png on the margin and wrap text around it .HnS
begin heading .HnE end heading .LK emit automatically
collected links. .HR produce a horizontal rule .NHR suppress
automatic generation of rules. .HTL only generate HTML title
.ULS unorder list begin .ULE unorder list end .LI insert a
list item .DC generate a drop capital .HTML pass an html raw
request to the device driver</p>

<p>Output of the pic, eqn, refer, and tbl preprocessors is
acceptable as input.</p>

<p>REQUESTS HX Specify the cut off depth when generating
links from section headings. For example, a parameter of 2
would cause grohtml to generate a list of links for .NH 1
and .NH 2 but not for .NH 3. Whereas</p>

<p>.HX 0</p>

<p>will tell grohtml that no heading links should be
created at all. Another method for turning automatic
headings off is by issuing the the command line switch -P-l
to groff.</p>

<p>BCL This macro takes five parameters: foreground,
background, active hypertext link, hypertext link not yet
visited, and visited hypertext link colour.</p>

<p>BGIMG the only parameter to this macro is the background
image file.</p>

<p>URL generates a URL using either two or three arguments.
The first parameter is the actual URL, the second is the
name of the link, and the third is optional stuff to be
printed immediately after- wards. Hyphenation is disabled
while printing the actual URL; explicit breakpoints should
be inserted with the : escape. Here is how to encode foo
http://foo.org/:</p>

<p>.URL http:/:foo:org/ foo :</p>

<p>If this is processed by a device other than -Thtml it
appears as:</p>

<p>foo http://foo.org:</p>

<p>The URL macro can be of any type; for example we can
reference Eric Raymonds pic guide pic.html by:</p>

<p>.URL pic.html &quot;Eric Raymons pic guide&quot;</p>

<p>MTO Generate an email html reference. The first argument
is manda- tory as the email address. The optional second
argument is the text you see in your browser, and an
optional third argument is stuff printed immediately
afterwards. Hyphenation is disabled while printing the
actual email address. For example, Joe User joe@user.org was
achieved by the following macro:</p>

<p>.MTO joe@user.org &quot;Joe User&quot;</p>

<p>Note that all the URLs actually are treated as consuming
no tex- tual space in groff. This could be considered as a
bug since it causes some problems. To circumvent this,
www.tmac inserts a zero-width character which expands to a
harmless space (only if run with -Thtml).</p>

<p>FTP indicates that data can be obtained via ftp. The
first argument is the url and the second is the browser
text. A third argu- ment, similar to the macros above, is
intended for stuff printed immediately afterwards. The
second and the third parameter are optional. Hyphenation is
disabled while printing the actual URL. As an example, here
the location of the GNU ftp server ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ . The
macro example above was specified by:</p>

<p>.FTP ftp:/:ftp.gnu.org/ &quot;GNU ftp server&quot; .</p>

<p>TAG Generates an html name tag from its argument. This
can then be referenced using the URL #URL macro. As you can
see, you must precede the tag name with # since it is a
local reference. This link was achieved via placing a TAG in
the URL description above; the source looks like this:</p>

<p>.TP .B URL generates .TAG URL a URL using either two or
three arguments. ...</p>

<p>IMG Include a picture into the document. The first
argument is the horizontal location: right, left, or center
(-R, -L, or -C). The second argument is the filename. The
optional third and fourth arguments are the width and
height. If the width is absent it defaults to 1 inch. If the
height is absent it defaults to the width. This maps onto an
html img tag. If you are including a png image then it is
advisable to use the PIMG macro.</p>

<p>PIMG Include an image in PNG format. This macro takes
exactly the same parameters as the IMG macro; it has the
advantage of work- ing with postscript and html devices also
since it can automati- cally convert the image into the EPS
format, using the following programs of the netpbm package:
pngtopnm, pnmcrop, and pnmtops. If the document isnt
processed with -Thtml it is necessary to use the -U option
of groff.</p>

<p>MPIMG Place a PNG image on the margin and wrap text
around it. The first parameter is the alignment: left or
right (-L or -R). The second argument is the filename. The
optional third and fourth arguments are the width and
height. If the width is absent it defaults to 1 inch. If the
height is absent it defaults to the width.</p>

<p>HnS Begin heading. The heading level is specified by the
first parameter. Use this macro of your headings contain
URLs. Exam- ple:</p>

<p>.HnS 1 .HR GNU Troff .URL http://groff.ffii.org (Groff)
a .URL http://www.gnu.org/ GNU project. Hosted by .URL
http://ffii.org/ FFII . .HR .HnE</p>

<p>HnE End heading.</p>

<p>LK Force grohtml to place the automatically generated
links at this position. If this manual page has been
processed with -Thtml those links can be seen right
here.</p>

<p>SECTION HEADING LINKS By default grohtml generates links
to all section headings and places these at the top of the
html document. (See LINKS #LK for details of how to switch
this off or alter the position).</p>

<p>HR Generate a full-width horizontal rule.</p>

<p>NHR Suppress generation of the top and bottom rules
which grohtml emits by default.</p>

<p>HTL Generate an HTML title only. This differs from the
TL macro of the ms macro package which generates both an
HTML title and an H1 heading. Use it to provide an HTML
title as search engine fodder but a graphic title in the
document.</p>

<p>HTML All text after this macro is treated as raw html.
If the docu- ment is processed without -Thtml then the macro
is ignored. Internally, this macro is used as a building
block for other higher-level macros.</p>

<p>For example, the BGIMG macro is defined as</p>

<p>.de BGIMG . HTML &lt;body background$1&gt; ..</p>

<p>DC Produce a drop capital. The first parameter is the
letter to be dropped and enlarged, the second parameter is
the ajoining text whose height the first letter should not
exceed. The optional third parameter is the color of the
dropped letter.</p>
