<p>SCHED_YIELD(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
SCHED_YIELD(2)</p>

<p>NAME sched_yield - yield the processor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sched.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sched_yield(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sched_yield() causes the calling thread to
relinquish the CPU. The thread is moved to the end of the
queue for its static priority and a new thread gets to
run.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, sched_yield() returns 0. On
error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS In the Linux implementation, sched_yield() always
succeeds.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES If the calling thread is the only thread in the
highest priority list at that time, it will continue to run
after a call to sched_yield().</p>

<p>POSIX systems on which sched_yield() is available define
_POSIX_PRIOR- ITY_SCHEDULING in &lt;unistd.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Strategic calls to sched_yield() can improve performance
by giving other threads or processes a chance to run when
(heavily) contended resources (e.g., mutexes) have been
released by the caller. Avoid calling sched_yield()
unnecessarily or inappropriately (e.g., when resources
needed by other schedulable threads are still held by the
caller), since doing so will result in unnecessary context
switches, which will degrade system performance.</p>

Linux scheduling.</p>
