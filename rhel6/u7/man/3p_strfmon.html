<p>STRFMON(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRFMON(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strfmon - convert monetary value to a string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;monetary.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t strfmon(char *restrict s, size_t maxsize, const
char *restrict format, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strfmon() function shall place
characters into the array pointed to by s as controlled by
the string pointed to by format. No more than maxsize bytes
are placed into the array.</p>

<p>The format is a character string, beginning and ending
in its initial state, if any, that contains two types of
objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to the
output stream, and conversion specifica- tions, each of
which shall result in the fetching of zero or more argu-
ments which are converted and formatted. The results are
undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the
format. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain,
the excess arguments are simply ignored.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that a conversion
specification consists of the following sequence:</p>

<p>* A%character</p>

<p>* Optional flags</p>

<p>* Optional field width</p>

<p>* Optional left precision</p>

<p>* Optional right precision</p>

<p>* A required conversion specifier character that
determines the con- version to be performed</p>

<p>Flags One or more of the following optional flags can be
specified to control the conversion:</p>

<p>=f An=followed by a single character f which is used as
the numeric fill character. In order to work with precision
or width counts, the fill character shall be a single byte
character; if not, the behavior is undefined. The default
numeric fill charac- ter is the &lt;space&gt;. This flag
does not affect field width fill- ing which always uses the
&lt;space&gt;. This flag is ignored unless a left precision
(see below) is specified.</p>

<p>^ Do not format the currency amount with grouping
characters. The default is to insert the grouping characters
if defined for the current locale.</p>

<p>+ or ( Specify the style of representing positive and
negative currency amounts. Only one of +or(may be specified.
If + is specified, the locales equivalent of+and-are used
(for example, in the U.S., the empty string if positive
and-if negative). If(is specified, negative amounts are
enclosed within parentheses. If neither flag is specified,
the+style is used.</p>

<p>! Suppress the currency symbol from the output
conversion.</p>

<p>- Specify the alignment. If this flag is present the
result of the conversion is left-justified (padded to the
right) rather than right-justified. This flag shall be
ignored unless a field width (see below) is specified.</p>

<p>Field Width w A decimal digit string w specifying a
minimum field width in bytes in which the result of the
conversion is right-justified (or left-justified if the
flag-is specified). The default is 0.</p>

<p>Left Precision #n A#followed by a decimal digit string n
specifying a maximum number of digits expected to be
formatted to the left of the radix character. This option
can be used to keep the formatted output from multiple calls
to the strfmon() function aligned in the same columns. It
can also be used to fill unused positions with a special
character as in &quot;$***123.45&quot; . This option causes
an amount to be formatted as if it has the number of digits
specified by n. If more than n digit positions are required,
this conversion specification is ignored. Digit positions in
excess of those actually required are filled with the
numeric fill character (see the =f flag above).</p>

<p>If grouping has not been suppressed with the ^ flag, and
it is defined for the current locale, grouping separators
are inserted before the fill characters (if any) are added.
Grouping separators are not applied to fill characters even
if the fill character is a digit.</p>

<p>To ensure alignment, any characters appearing before or
after the num- ber in the formatted output such as currency
or sign symbols are padded as necessary with &lt;space&gt;s
to make their positive and negative formats an equal
length.</p>

<p>Right Precision .p A period followed by a decimal digit
string p specifying the number of digits after the radix
character. If the value of the right precision p is 0, no
radix character appears. If a right precision is not
included, a default specified by the current locale is used.
The amount being formatted is rounded to the specified
number of digits prior to formatting.</p>

<p>Conversion Specifier Characters The conversion specifier
characters and their meanings are:</p>

<p>i The double argument is formatted according to the
locales international currency format (for example, in the
U.S.: USD 1,234.56). If the argument is &plusmn;Inf or NaN,
the result of the conversion is unspecified.</p>

<p>n The double argument is formatted according to the
locales national currency format (for example, in the U.S.:
$1,234.56). If the argument is &plusmn;Inf or NaN, the
result of the conversion is unspecified.</p>

<p>% Convert to a %; no argument is converted. The entire
conver- sion specification shall be %% .</p>

<p>Locale Information The LC_MONETARY category of the
program s locale affects the behavior of this function
including the monetary radix character (which may be
different from the numeric radix character affected by the
LC_NUMERIC category), the grouping separator, the currency
symbols, and formats. The international currency symbol
should be conformant with the ISO 4217:1995 standard.</p>

<p>If the value of maxsize is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the
result is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the total number of resulting bytes
including the terminating null byte is not more than
maxsize, strfmon() shall return the number of bytes placed
into the array pointed to by s, not including the termi-
nating null byte. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, the
contents of the array are unspecified, and errno shall be
set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The strfmon() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>E2BIG Conversion stopped due to lack of space in the
buffer.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Given a locale for the U.S. and the values
123.45, -123.45, and 3456.781, the following output might be
produced. Square brackets ( &quot;[]&quot; ) are used in
this example to delimit the output.</p>
