<p>XtInsertEventTypeHandler(3) XT FUNCTIONS
XtInsertEventTypeHandler(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtInsertEventTypeHandler, XtRemoveEventTypeHandler,
XtRegisterExten- sionSelector, XtSetEventDispatcher,
XtDispatchEventToWidget - extension event handling</p>

<p>SYNTAX void XtInsertEventTypeHandler(Widget widget, int
event_type, XtPointer select_data, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data, XtList- Position position);</p>

<p>void XtRemoveEventTypeHandler(Widget widget, int
event_type, XtPointer select_data, XtEventHandler proc,
XtPointer client_data);</p>

<p>void XtRegisterExtensionSelector(Display* display, int
min_event_type, int max_event_type, XtExtensionSelectProc
proc, XtPointer client_data);</p>

<p>XtEventDispatchProc XtSetEventDispatcher(Widget widget,
int event_type, XtEventDispatchProc proc);</p>

<p>Boolean XtDispatchEventToWidget(Widget widget, XEvent*
event);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS widget Specifies the widget for this event
handler. Must be of class Core or any subclass thereof.</p>

<p>event_type Specifies the event type.</p>

<p>select_data Specifies data used to select or deselect
events from the server.</p>

<p>proc Specifies the proc.</p>

<p>client_data Specifies additional data to be passed to
the event handler.</p>

<p>position Specifies when the event handler is to be
called relative to other previously registered handlers.</p>

<p>display Specifies the display.</p>

<p>min_event_type, max_event_type Specifies the range of
event types for this extension.</p>

<p>event Specifies a pointer to the event to be
dispatched.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XtInsertEventTypeHandler function
registers a procedure with the dispatch mechanism that is to
be called when an event that matches the specified
event_type is dispatched to the specified widget.</p>

<p>If event_type is one of the core X protocol events then
select_data must be a pointer to a value of type EventMask,
indicating the event mask to be used to select for the
desired event. This event mask will be included in the value
returned by XtBuildEventMask. If the widget is realized
XtInsertEventTypeHandler calls XSelectInput if necessary.
Specifying NULL for select_data is equivalent to specifying
a pointer to an event mask containing 0. This is similar to
the XtInsertRawEven- tHandler function.</p>

<p>If event_type specifies an extension event type then the
semantics of the data pointed to by select_data are defined
by the extension selec- tor registered for the specified
event type.</p>

<p>In either case the Intrinsics are not required to copy
the data pointed to by select_data, so the caller must
ensure that it remains valid as long as the event handler
remains registered with this value of select_data.</p>

<p>The position argument allows the client to control the
order of the invocation of event handlers registered for the
same event type. If the client does not care about the
order, it should normally specify XtListTail, which
registers this event handler after any previously registered
handlers for this event type.</p>

<p>The XtRemoveEventTypeHandler function unregisters an
even handler reg- istered with XtInsertEventTypeHandler for
the specified event type. The request is ignored if
client_data does not match the value given with the handler
was registered.</p>

<p>If event_type specifies on of the core X protocol
events, select_data must be a pointer to a value of type
EventMask, indicating the mask to be used to deselect for
the appropriate event. If the widget is real- ized,
XtRemoveEventTypeHandler calls XSelectInput if necessary.
Speci- fying NULL for select_data is equivalent to
specifying a pointer to an event mask containing 0. This is
similar to the XtRemoveRawEventHandler function.</p>

<p>If event_type specifies an extension event type then the
semantics of the data pointed to by select_data are defined
by the extension selec- tor registered for the specified
event type.</p>

<p>The XtRegisterExtensionSelector function registers a
procedure to arrange for the delivery of extension events to
widgets.</p>

<p>If min_event_type and max_event_type match the
parameters to a previous call to XtRegisterExtensionSelector
for the same display, the proc and client_data replace the
previously registered values. If the range specified by
min_event_type and max_event_type overlaps the range of the
parameters to a previous call for the same display in any
other way, an error results.</p>

<p>The XtSetEventDispatcher function registers the event
dispatcher proce- dure specified by proc for events with the
type event_type. The previ- ously registered dispatcher (or
the default dispatcher if there was no previously registered
dispatcher) is returned. If proc is NULL, the default
procedure is restored for the specified type.</p>

<p>In the future, when XtDispatchEvent is called with an
event of event_type, the specified proc (or the default
dispatcher) will be invoked to determine a widget ot which
to dispatch the event.</p>

<p>The XtDispatchEventToWidget function scans the list of
registered event handlers for the specified widget and calls
each handler that has been registered for the specified
event type, subject to the con- tinue_to_dispatch value
returned by each handler. The Intrinsics behave as if event
handlers were registered at the head of the list for Expose,
NoExpose, GraphicsExpose, and VisibilityNotify events to
invoke the widget s expose procedure according to the
exposure compression rules and to update the widget s
visible field if visible_interest is True. These internal
event handlers never set continue_to_dispatch to False.</p>

<p>XtDispatchEventToWidget returns True if any event
handler was called and False otherwise.</p>
