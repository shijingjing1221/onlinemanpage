<p>SETVBUF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual SETVBUF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME setvbuf - assign buffering to a stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int setvbuf(FILE *restrict stream, char *restrict buf,
int type, size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The setvbuf() function may be used after the
stream pointed to by stream is associated with an open file
but before any other operation (other than an unsuccessful
call to setvbuf()) is performed on the stream. The argument
type determines how stream shall be buffered, as
follows:</p>

<p>* {_IOFBF} shall cause input/output to be fully
buffered.</p>

<p>* {_IOLBF} shall cause input/output to be line
buffered.</p>

<p>* {_IONBF} shall cause input/output to be
unbuffered.</p>

<p>If buf is not a null pointer, the array it points to may
be used instead of a buffer allocated by setvbuf() and the
argument size speci- fies the size of the array; otherwise,
size may determine the size of a buffer allocated by the
setvbuf() function. The contents of the array at any time
are unspecified.</p>

<p>For information about streams, see Standard I/O Streams
.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, setvbuf() shall
return 0. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value if an
invalid value is given for type or if the request cannot be
honored, and may set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The setvbuf() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The file descriptor underlying stream is not
valid.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE A common source of error is allocating
buffer space as an &quot;automatic&quot; variable in a code
block, and then failing to close the stream in the same
block.</p>

<p>With setvbuf(), allocating a buffer of size bytes does
not necessarily imply that all of size bytes are used for
the buffer area.</p>

<p>Applications should note that many implementations only
provide line buffering on input from terminal devices.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
