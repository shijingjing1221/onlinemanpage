<p>WCSNRTOMBS(3) Linux Programmer s Manual

<p>NAME wcsnrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a
multibyte string</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcsnrtombs(char *dest, const wchar_t **src,
size_t nwc, size_t len, mbstate_t *ps);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsnrtombs() function is like the
wcsrtombs(3) function, except that the number of wide
characters to be converted, starting at *src, is limited to
nwc.</p>

<p>If dest is not a NULL pointer, the wcsnrtombs() function
converts at most nwc wide characters from the wide-character
string *src to a multibyte string starting at dest. At most
len bytes are written to dest. The shift state *ps is
updated. The conversion is effectively performed by
repeatedly calling wcrtomb(dest, *src, ps), as long as this
call succeeds, and then incrementing dest by the number of
bytes written and *src by one. The conversion can stop for
three reasons:</p>

<p>1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be
represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the
current locale). In this case *src is left pointing to the
invalid wide character, (size_t) -1 is returned, and errno
is set to EILSEQ.</p>

<p>2. nwc wide characters have been converted without
encountering a L&rsquo; &rsquo;, or the length limit forces
a stop. In this case *src is left pointing to the next wide
character to be converted, and the number of bytes written
to dest is returned.</p>

<p>3. The wide-character string has been completely
converted, including the terminating L&rsquo; &rsquo; (which
has the side effect of bringing back *ps to the initial
state). In this case *src is set to NULL, and the num- ber
of bytes written to dest, excluding the terminating &rsquo;
&rsquo; byte, is returned.</p>

<p>If dest is NULL, len is ignored, and the conversion
proceeds as above, except that the converted bytes are not
written out to memory, and that no destination length limit
exists.</p>

<p>In both of the above cases, if ps is a NULL pointer, a
static anonymous state only known to the wcsnrtombs function
is used instead.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least len bytes at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcsnrtombs() function returns the
number of bytes that make up the converted part of multibyte
sequence, not including the terminating null byte. If a wide
character was encountered which could not be con- verted,
(size_t) -1 is returned, and errno set to EILSEQ.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>

<p>NOTES The behavior of wcsnrtombs() depends on the
LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.</p>

<p>Passing NULL as ps is not multithread safe.</p>
