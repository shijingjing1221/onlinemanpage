<p>NAME ppmshadow - add simulated shadows to a PPM
image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmshadow [-b blur_size] [-k] [-t] [-x xoffset]
[-y yoffset] [ppmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmshadow adds a simulated shadow to an image, giving
the appearance that the contents of the image float above
the page, casting a diffuse shadow on the background.
Shadows can either be black, as cast by opaque objects, or
translucent, where the shadow takes on the color of the
object which casts it. You can specify the crispness of the
shadow and its displacement from the image with command line
options.</p>

<p>ppmshadow sees your image as a foreground on a
background. The back- ground color is whatever color the top
left pixel of your image is. The background is all the
pixels that are that color and the foreground is everything
else. The shadow that ppmshadow generates is a shadow of the
foreground, cast on the background.</p>

<p>The shadow is the same size as the foreground, plus some
fringes as determined by the -b option. It is truncated to
fit in your image. The output image is the same dimensions
as the input image.</p>

<p>You can use pamcomp to place a foreground image over a
background before running ppmshadow on it. You can use
ppmmake to make the back- ground image (just an image of a
solid color).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b blur_size Sets the distance of the light
source from the image. Larger values move the light source
closer, casting a more diffuse shadow, while smaller
settings move the light further away, yielding a sharper
shadow. blur_size is the number of pixels of fringe there is
on the shadow, beyond where the shadow would be if there
were no blurring.</p>

<p>The default is 11 pixels.</p>

<p>Note that this option controls only the fringing effect
of mov- ing the light source closer to the object. It does
not make the shadow grow or shrink as would happpen in the
real world if you moved a point light source closer to and
further from an object.</p>

<p>-k Keep the intermediate temporary image files. When
debugging, these intermediate files provide many clues as to
the source of an error. See below for a list of the contents
of each file.</p>

<p>-t Consider the non-background material in the image
translucent -- it casts shadows of its own color rather than
a black shadow, which is default. This often results in
fuzzy, difficult-to- read images but in some circumstances
may look better.</p>

<p>-x xoffset Specifies the displacement of the light
source to the left of the image. Larger settings of xoffset
displace the shadow to the right, as would be cast by a
light further to the left. If not specified, the horizontal
offset is half of blur_size (above), to the left.</p>

<p>-y yoffset Specifies the displacement of the light
source above the top of the image. Larger settings displace
the shadow downward, corre- sponding to moving the light
further above the top of the image. If you don t specify -y,
the vertical offset defaults to the same as the horizontal
offset (above), upward.</p>

<p>FILES Input is a PPM file named by the ppmfile command
line argument; if you dont specify ppmfile, the input is
Standard Input.</p>

<p>The output is a PPM file, written to Standard
Output.</p>

<p>ppmshadow creates a number of temporary files as it
executes. It cre- ates a new directory for them,
/tmp/ppmshadowpid, where pid is the pro- cess ID of the
ppmshadow process. If the TMPDIR environment variable is
set, ppmshadow creates the directory there instead of
/tmp.</p>

<p>In normal operation, ppmshadow deletes each temporary
file as soon as it is done with it and leaves no debris
around after it completes. To preserve the intermediate
files for debugging, use the -k command line option.</p>

<p>The temporary files are:</p>

<p>infile.ppm A copy of the input.</p>

<p>bgmask.ppm Positive binary mask</p>

<p>convkernel.ppm Convolution kernel for blurring
shadow</p>

<p>blurred.ppm Blurred, colored shadow image</p>

<p>blurred2.ppm Blurred shadow image before coloring</p>

<p>shadow.ppm Clipped shadow image, offset as requested</p>

<p>background.ppm Blank image with background of source
image</p>

<p>shadow.ppm Offset shadow</p>

<p>fgmask.ppm Inverse mask file</p>

<p>justfg.ppm Just the foreground. Rest is black. Original
image times inverse mask.</p>

<p>shadback.ppm Generated shadow times positive mask</p>

<p>allbutfg.ppm Everything but the foreground (foreground
area is black).</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS The source image must contain sufficient
space on the edges in the direction in which the shadow is
cast to contain the shadow -- if it doesnt some of the
internal steps may fail. You can usually expand the border
of a too-tightly-cropped image with pnmmargin before pro-
cessing it with ppmshadow.</p>

<p>Black pixels and pixels with the same color as the image
background don t cast a shadow. If this causes unintentional
holes in the shadow, fill the offending areas with a color
which differs from black or the background by RGB values of
1, which will be imperceptible to the viewer. Since the
comparison is exact, the modified areas will now cast
shadows.</p>

<p>The background color of the source image (which is
preserved in the output) is deemed to be the color of the
pixel at the top left of the input image. If that pixel isnt
part of the background, simply add a one-pixel border at the
top of the image, generate the shadow image, then delete the
border from it.</p>

<p>If something goes wrong along the way, the error
messages from the var- ious Netpbm programs ppmshadow calls
will, in general, provide little or no clue as to where
ppmshadow went astray. In this case, Specify the -k option
and examine the intermediate results in the temporary files
(which this option causes to be preserved). If you manually
run the commands that ppmshadow runs on these files, you can
figure out where the problem is. In problem cases where you
want to manually tweak the image generation process along
the way, you can keep the intermediate files with the -k
option, modify them appropriately with an image editor, then
recombine them with the steps used by the code in
ppmshadow.</p>

<p>See the ppmshadow.doc file in the Netpbm source tree for
additional details and examples of the intermediate files
and debugging ppmshadow.</p>

<p>Shadows are by default black, as cast by opaque material
in the image occluding white light. Use the -t option to
simulate translucent mate- rial, where the shadow takes on
the color of the object that casts it. If the contrast
between the image and background is insufficient, the -t
option may yield unattractive results which resemble simple
blurring of the original image.</p>

<p>Because Netpbm used to have a maximum maxval of 255,
which meant that the largest convolution kernel pnmconvol
could use was 11 by 11, ppmshadow includes a horrid,
CPU-time-burning kludge which, if a blur of greater than 11
is requested, performs an initial convolution with an 11 x
11 kernel, then calls pnmsmooth (which is itself a program
that calls pnmconvol with a 3 x 3 kernel) as many times as
the requested blur exceeds 11. Its ugly, but it gets the job
done on those rare occasions where you need a blur greater
than 11.</p>

<p>If you wish to generate an image at high resolution,
then scale it to publication size with pamscale in order to
eliminate jagged edges by resampling, it s best to generate
the shadow in the original high reso- lution image, prior to
scaling it down in size. If you scale first and then add the
shadow, youll get an unsightly jagged stripe between the
edge of material and its shadow, due to resampled pixels
intermediate between the image and background obscuring the
shadow.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS ppmshadow returns status 0 if processing was
completed without errors, and a nonzero Unix error code if
an error prevented generation of out- put. Some errors may
result in the script aborting, usually displaying error
messages from various Netpbm components it uses, without
return- ing a nonzero error code. When this happens, the
output file will be empty, so be sure to test this if you
need to know if the program suc- ceeded.</p>
