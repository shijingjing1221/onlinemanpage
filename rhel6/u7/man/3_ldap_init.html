<p>DESCRIPTION ldap_open() opens a connection to an LDAP
server and allocates an LDAP structure which is used to
identify the connection and to maintain per- connection
information. ldap_init() allocates an LDAP structure but
does not open an initial connection. ldap_initialize()
allocates an LDAP structure but does not open an initial
connection. ldap_init_fd() allocates an LDAP structure using
an existing connection on the pro- vided socket. One of
these routines must be called before any opera- tions are
attempted.</p>

<p>ldap_open() takes host, the hostname on which the LDAP
server is run- ning, and port, the port number to which to
connect. If the default IANA-assigned port of 389 is
desired, LDAP_PORT should be specified for port. The host
parameter may contain a blank-separated list of hosts to try
to connect to, and each host may optionally by of the form
host:port. If present, the :port overrides the port
parameter to ldap_open(). Upon successfully making a
connection to an LDAP server, ldap_open() returns a pointer
to an opaque LDAP structure, which should be passed to
subsequent calls to ldap_bind(), ldap_search(), etc. Cer-
tain fields in the LDAP structure can be set to indicate
size limit, time limit, and how aliases are handled during
operations; read and write access to those fields must occur
by calling ldap_get_option(3) and ldap_set_option(3)
respectively, whenever possible.</p>

<p>ldap_init() acts just like ldap_open(), but does not
open a connection to the LDAP server. The actual connection
open will occur when the first operation is attempted.</p>

<p>ldap_initialize() acts like ldap_init(), but it returns
an integer indicating either success or the failure reason,
and it allows to spec- ify details for the connection in the
schema portion of the URI. The uri parameter may be a comma-
or whitespace-separated list of URIs con- taining only the
schema, the host, and the port fields. Apart from ldap,
other (non-standard) recognized values of the schema field
are ldaps (LDAP over TLS), ldapi (LDAP over IPC), and cldap
(connectionless LDAP). If other fields are present, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>At this time, ldap_open() and ldap_init() are deprecated
in favor of ldap_initialize(), essentially because the
latter allows to specify a schema in the URI and it
explicitly returns an error code.</p>

<p>ldap_init_fd() allows an LDAP structure to be
initialized using an already-opened connection. The proto
parameter should be one of LDAP_PROTO_TCP, LDAP_PROTO_UDP,
or LDAP_PROTO_IPC for a connection using TCP, UDP, or IPC,
respectively. The value LDAP_PROTO_EXT may also be specified
if user-supplied sockbuf handlers are going to be used. Note
that support for UDP is not implemented unless libldap was
built with LDAP_CONNECTIONLESS defined. The uri parameter
may optionally be provided for informational purposes.</p>

<p>ldap_set_urllist_proc() allows to set a function proc of
type LDAP_URL- LIST_PROC that is called when a successful
connection can be estab- lished. This function receives the
list of URIs parsed from the uri string originally passed to
ldap_initialize(), and the one that suc- cessfully
connected. The function may manipulate the URI list; the
typical use consists in moving the successful URI to the
head of the list, so that subsequent attempts to connect to
one of the URIs using the same LDAP handle will try it
first. If ld is null, proc is set as a global parameter that
is inherited by all handlers within the process that are
created after the call to ldap_set_urllist_proc(). By
default, no LDAP_URLLIST_PROC is set. In a multithreaded
environment, ldap_set_urllist_proc() must be called before
any concurrent operation using the LDAP handle is
started.</p>

<p>Note: the first call into the LDAP library also
initializes the global options for the library. As such the
first call should be single- threaded or otherwise protected
to insure that only one call is active. It is recommended
that ldap_get_option() or ldap_set_option() be used in the
programs main thread before any additional threads are
created. See ldap_get_option(3).</p>

<p>ERRORS If an error occurs, ldap_open() and ldap_init()
will return NULL and errno should be set appropriately.
ldap_initialize() and ldap_init_fd() will directly return
the LDAP code associated to the error (or LDAP_SUCCESS in
case of success); errno should be set as well whenever
appropriate. ldap_set_urllist_proc() returns LDAP_OPT_ERROR
on error, and LDAP_OPT_SUCCESS on success.</p>
