<p>SDL_ActiveEvent(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_ActiveEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_ActiveEvent - Application visibility event
structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DEFINITION typedef struct{ Uint8 type; Uint8
gain; Uint8 state; } SDL_ActiveEvent;</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DATA type SDL_ACTIVEEVENT.</p>

<p>gain 0 if the event is a loss or 1 if it is a gain.</p>

<p>state SDL_APPMOUSEFOCUS if mouse focus was gained or
lost, SDL_APPINPUTFOCUS if input focus was gained or lost,
or SDL_APPACTIVE if the application was iconified (gain=0)
or restored(gain=1).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_ActiveEvent is a member of the SDL_Event
union and is used when an event of type SDL_ACTIVEEVENT is
reported.</p>

<p>When the mouse leaves or enters the window area a
SDL_APPMOUSEFOCUS type activation event occurs, if the mouse
entered the window then gain will be 1, otherwise gain will
be 0. A SDL_APPINPUTFOCUS type activa- tion event occurs
when the application loses or gains keyboard focus. This
usually occurs when another application is made active.
Finally, a SDL_APPACTIVE type event occurs when the
application is either min- imised/iconified (gain=0) or
restored.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>This event does not occur when an application window is
first created.</p>
