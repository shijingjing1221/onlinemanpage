<p>NAME pnmtopnm - copy a PNM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pnmtopnm</p>

<p>[pnmfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pnmtopnm simply copies a PNM image to Standard Output.
The output has the same major PNM format (PBM, PGM, or PPM)
and maxval as the input. This may seem an unnecessary
duplication of cat, but it lets you con- vert between the
plain (ASCII) and raw (binary) subformats of PNM. Use the
-plain Netpbm common option to ensure the output is plain
PNM, and dont use -plain to ensure the output is raw PNM.
See Common Options .</p>

<p>You don t normally need to convert between the PNM
subformats, because any program that uses the Netpbm library
to read a PNM image will read all of them directly. But
there are a lot of programs that dont use the Netpbm library
and understand only the raw format. Plain format is nice
because it is human readable; people often use it to debug
pro- grams that process PNM images.</p>

<p>pnmtopnm is really just another name for the program
pamtopnm. The latter does the job because like any Netpbm
program that takes PAM input via the Netpbm programming
library facilities, it also takes PNM input.</p>

<p>HISTORY pnmtopnm was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004). It
obsoleted pnmto- plainpnm, which specifically did the
conversion to plain PNM. There was no program to explicitly
convert to raw PNM, but many Netpbm pro- grams can be made,
with the right options, to be idempotent (i.e. to do the
same thing as pnmtopnm).</p>

<p>Then David Jones realized that the existing pamtopnm
already did every- thing that pnmtopnm did and more, so in
Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), pnm- topnm became simply an
alternate name for pamtopnm.</p>
