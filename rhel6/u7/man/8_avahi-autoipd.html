<p>NAME avahi-autoipd - IPv4LL network address
configuration daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS avahi-autoipd [options] interface</p>

<p>avahi-autoipd --kill interface</p>

<p>avahi-autoipd --refresh interface</p>

<p>avahi-autoipd --check interface</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION avahi-autoipd implements IPv4LL,
&quot;Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link- Local
Addresses&quot; (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP
address configuration from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16
range without the need for a central server. It is primarily
intended to be used in ad-hoc networks which lack a DHCP
server.</p>

<p>IPv4LL is part of the Zeroconf stack.</p>

<p>avahi-autoipd can be used as stand-alone address
allocator or as plugin for a DHCP client such as ISCs
dhclient, where it can be used as fall- back solution if no
DHCP server is found.</p>

<p>To allow communication between hosts that have only an
IPv4LL address assigned and hosts that only have a routable
IP address assigned you may add the following routes to both
network configurations:</p>

<p>route add -net 169.254.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 dev eth0
metric 99</p>

<p>route add default dev eth0 metric 99</p>

<p>See http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2004/qa1357.html for
more informa- tion.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D | --daemonize Daemonize after startup.
Implies --syslog.</p>

<p>-k | --kill Kill an already running avahi-autoipd on the
specified network interface. (Equivalent to sending a
SIGTERM)</p>

<p>-r | --refresh Tell an already running avahi-autoipd to
reannounce the acquired IP address on the specified network
interface. (Equivalent to sending a SIGHUP)</p>

<p>-c | --check Return 0 as return code if avahi-autoipd is
already running for the specified network interface.</p>

<p>-s | --syslog Log to syslog instead of STDERR. Implied
by --daemonize.</p>

<p>--debug Enable verbose mode.</p>

<p>--no-drop-root Don t drop root priviliges after startup.
We recommend not to use this option.</p>

<p>--no-chroot Dont chroot(2) the daemon. This option is
only available when compiled with chroot() support.</p>

<p>-S | --start= Try to acquire the specified IP address,
which must be from the IPv4LL range 169.254.0.0/16.</p>

<p>-w | --wait Wait until a IP address has been sucessfully
acquired before detaching. Only valid in combination with
--daemonize.</p>

<p>--force-bind Acquire an IPv4LL address, even if a
routable address has been configured on the interface.</p>

<p>--no-proc-title Dont change the process name while
running. Unless this option is specified avahi-autoipd will
reflect its current state and the IP address in the process
title.</p>

<p>-h | --help Show help.</p>

<p>-v | --version Show version information.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/avahi/avahi-autoipd.action: the script to run
when an IP address as been acquired or is lost.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT: avahi-autoipd will
shutdown. (Same as --kill)</p>

<p>SIGHUP: avahi-autoipd will reannounce the acquired IP
address. (Same as --refresh)</p>
