<p>WCSNCMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSNCMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcsncmp - compare part of two wide-character
strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int wcsncmp(const wchar_t *ws1, const wchar_t *ws2,
size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsncmp() function shall compare not
more than n wide-character codes (wide-character codes that
follow a null wide-character code are not compared) from the
array pointed to by ws1 to the array pointed to by ws2.</p>

<p>The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined
by the sign of the difference between the values of the
first pair of wide-character codes that differ in the
objects being compared.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, wcsncmp() shall
return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if
the possibly null-terminated array pointed to by ws1 is
greater than, equal to, or less than the possibly
null-terminated array pointed to by ws2, respectively.</p>
