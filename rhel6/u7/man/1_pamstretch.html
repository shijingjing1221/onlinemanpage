<p>NAME pamstretch - scale up a PNM or PAM image by
interpolating between pix- els.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pamstretch</p>

<p>[-xscale=X]</p>

<p>[-yscale=Y] [-blackedge]</p>

<p>[-dropedge]</p>

<p>N</p>

<p>[infile]</p>

<p>You can use the minimum unique abbreviation of the
options. You can use two hyphens instead of one. You can
separate an option name from its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamstretch scales up pictures by integer values, either
vertically, horizontally, or both. pamstretch differs from
pamscale and pamen- large in that when it inserts the
additional rows and columns, instead of making the new row
or column a copy of its neighbor, pamstretch makes the new
row or column an interpolation between its neighbors. In
some images, this produces better looking output.</p>

<p>To scale up to non-integer pixel sizes, e.g. 2.5, try
pamstretch- gen(1)instead.</p>

<p>Options let you select alternative methods of dealing
with the right/bottom edges of the picture. Since the
interpolation is done between the top-left corners of the
scaled-up pixels, its not obvious what to do with the
right/bottom edges. The default behaviour is to scale those
up without interpolation (more precisely, the right edge is
only interpolated vertically, and the bottom edge is only
interpolated horizontally), but there are two other
possibilities, selected by the blackedge and dropedge
options.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS The N parameter is the scale factor. It is
valid only if you dont specify -xscale or -yscale. In that
case, pamstretch scales in both dimensions and by the scale
factor N.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -xscale=X This is the horizontal scale factor.
If you don t specify this, but do specify a vertical scale
factor, the horizontal scale factor is 1.</p>

<p>-yscale=Y This is the vertical scale factor. If you don
t specify this, but do specify a horizontal scale factor,
the vertical scale factor is 1.</p>

<p>-blackedge interpolate to black at right/bottom
edges.</p>

<p>-dropedge drop one (source) pixel at right/bottom edges.
This is arguably more logical than the default behaviour,
but it means producing output which is a slightly odd
size.</p>

<p>BUGS Usually produces fairly ugly output for PBMs. For
most PBM input youll probably want to reduce the noise first
using something like pnmnl- filt(1).</p>
