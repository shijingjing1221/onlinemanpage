<p>NAME gpm - a cut and paste utility and mouse server for
virtual consoles</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpm [ options ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This package tries to be a useful mouse
server for applications running on the Linux console. It is
based on the &quot;selection&quot; package, and some of its
code comes from selection itself. This package is intended
as a replacement for &quot;selection&quot; as a
cut-and-paste mechanism; it also pro- vides additional
facilities. The &quot;selection&quot; package offered the
first cut-and-paste implementation for Linux using two mouse
buttons, and the cut buffer is still called &quot;selection
buffer&quot; or just &quot;selection&quot; throughout this
document. The information below is extracted from the
texinfo file, which is the preferred source of
information.</p>

<p>The gpm executable is meant to act like a daemon (thus,
gpmd would be a better name for it). This section is meant
to describe the command-line options for gpm, while its
internals are outlined in the next section.</p>

<p>Due to restrictions in the ioctl(TIOCLINUX) system call,
gpm must be run by the superuser. The restrictions have been
added in the last 1.1 kernels to fix a security hole related
to selection and screen dumping.</p>

<p>The server can be configured to match the user s taste,
and any appli- cation using the mouse will inherit the
servers attitude. From release 1.02 up to 1.19.2 is was
possible for any user logged on the system console to change
the mouse feeling using the -q option. This is no longer
possible for security reasons.</p>

<p>As of 0.97 the server program puts itself in the
background. To kill gpm you can just reinvoke it with the -k
cmdline switch, although kil- lall gpm can be a better
choice.</p>

<p>SPECIAL COMMANDS Version 1.10 adds the capability to
execute special commands on certain circumstances. Special
commands default to rebooting and halting the system, but
the user can specify his/her personal choice. The capabil-
ity to invoke commands using the mouse is a handy one for
programmers, because it allows to issue a clean shutdown
when the keyboard is locked and no network is available to
restore the system to a sane state.</p>

<p>Special commands are toggled by triple-clicking the left
and right but- ton -- an unlikely event during normal mouse
usage. The easiest way to triple-click is pressing one of
the buttons and triple-click the other one. When special
processing is toggled, a message appears on the con- sole
(and the speaker beeps twice, if you have a speaker); if the
user releases all the buttons and presses one of them again
within three seconds, then the special command corresponding
to the button is exe- cuted.</p>

<p>The default special commands are:</p>

<p>left button Reboot the system by signalling the init
process</p>

<p>middle button (if any) Execute /sbin/shutdown -h now</p>

<p>right button Execute /sbin/shutdown -r now</p>

<p>The -S command line switch enables special command
processing and allows to change the three special commands.
To accept the default com- mands use -S &quot;&quot; (i.e.,
specify an empty argument). To specify your own commands,
use a colon-separated list to specify commands associated to
the left, middle and right button. If any of the commands is
empty, it is interpreted as send a signal to the init
process. This particular operation is supported, in addition
to executing external commands, because sometimes bad bugs
put the system to the impossibility to fork; in these rare
case the programmer should be able to shutdown the system
anyways, and killing init from a running process is the only
way to do it.</p>

<p>As an example, -S &quot;:telinit 1:/sbin/halt&quot;,
associates killing init to the left button, going single
user to the middle one, and halting the system to the right
button.</p>

<p>System administrators should obviously be careful about
special com- mands, as gpm runs with superuser permissions.
Special commands are best suited for computers whose mouse
can be physically accessed only by trusted people.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS Available command line options are
the following:</p>

<p>-a accel Set the acceleration value used when a single
motion event is longer than delta (see -d).</p>

<p>-A[limit] Start up with selection pasting disabled. This
is intended as a security measure; a plausible attack on a
system seems to be to stuff a nasty shell command into the
selection buffer (rm -rf /) including the terminating line
break, then all the victim has to do is click the middle
mouse button .. As of version 1.17.2, this has developed
into a more general aging mechanism; the gpm daemon can
disable (age) selection pasting automatically after a period
of inactivity. To enable this mode just give the optional
limit parameter (no space in between !) which is interpreted
as the time in seconds for which a selection is con- sidered
valid and pastable. As of version 1.15.7, a trivial program
called disable-paste is provided. The following makes a good
addition to /etc/profile if you allow multiple users to work
on your console.</p>

<p>case $( /usr/bin/tty ) in /dev/tty[0-9]*)
/usr/bin/disable-paste ;; esac</p>

<p>-b baud Set the baud rate.</p>

<p>-B sequence Set the button sequence. 123 is the normal
sequence, 321 can be used by left-handed people, and 132 can
be useful with two-but- ton mice (especially within Emacs).
All the button permutations are allowable.</p>

<p>-d delta Set the delta value. When a single motion event
is longer than delta, accel is used as a multiplying factor.
(Must be 2 or above)</p>

<p>-D Do not automatically enter background operation when
started, and log messages to the standard error stream, not
the syslog mechanism. This is useful for debugging; in
previous releases it was done with a compile-time
option.</p>

<p>-g number With glidepoint devices, emulate the specified
button with tap- ping. number must be 1, 2, or 3, and refers
to the button num- ber before the -B button remapping is
performed. This option applies to the mman and ps2 decoding.
No button is emulated by default because the ps2 tapping is
incompatible with some normal ps2 mice</p>

<p>-h Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>-i interval Set interval to be used as an upper time
limit for multiple clicks. If the interval between button-up
and button-down events is less than limit, the press is
considered a double or triple click. Time is in
milliseconds.</p>

<p>-k Kill a running gpm. This can be used by busmouse
users to kill gpm before running X (unless they use -R or
the single-open lim- itation is removed from the
kernel).</p>

<p>-l charset Choose the inword() look up table. The
charset argument is a list of characters. - is used to
specify a range and is used to escape the next character or
to provide octal codes. Only visible character can appear in
charset because control charac- ters cat appear in text-mode
video memory, whence selection is cut.</p>

<p>-m filename Choose the mouse file to open. Must be
before -t and -o.</p>

<p>-M Enable multiple mode. The daemon will read two
different mouse devices. Any subsequent option will refer to
the second device, while any preceding option will be used
for the first device. This option automatically forces the
repeater (-R) option on.</p>

<p>-o list-of-extra-options The option works similary to
the -o option of mount; it is used to specify a list of
extra options that are specific to each mouse type. The list
is comma-separated. The options dtr, rts or both are used by
the serial initialization to toggle the modem lines like,
compatibly with earlier gpm versions; note however that
using -o dtr associated with non-plain-serial mouse types
may now generate an error. And by the way, use -o after -m
and after -t.</p>

<p>-p Forces the pointer to be visible while selecting.
This is the behaviour of selection-1.7, but it is sometimes
confusing. The default is not to show the pointer, which can
be confusing as well.</p>

<p>-r number Set the responsiveness. A higher
responsiveness is used for a faster cursor motion.</p>

<p>-R[name] Causes gpm to act as a repeater: any mouse data
received while in graphic mode will be produced on the fifo
/dev/gpmdata in protocol name, given as an optional argument
(no space in between !). In principle, you can use the same
names as for the -t option, although repeating into some
protocols may not be implemented for a while. In addition,
you can specify raw as the name, to repeat the mouse data
byte by byte, without any protocol translation. If name is
omitted, it defaults to msc. Using gpm in repeater mode, you
can configure the X server to use its fifo as a mouse
device. This option is useful for bus- mouse owners to
override the single-open limitation. It is also an easy way
to manage those stupid dual-mode mice which force you to
keep the middle button down while changing video mode. The
option is forced on by the -M option.</p>

<p>-s number Set the sample rate for the mouse device.</p>

<p>-S commands Enable special-command processing, and
optionally specify custom commands as a colon-separated
list. See above for a detailed description of special
commands.</p>

<p>-t name Set the mouse type. Use -t help to get a list of
allowable types. Since version 1.18.1, the list also shows
which protocols are available as repeaters (see -R above),
by marking them with an asterisk (*).</p>

<p>Use -t after you selected the mouse device with -m.</p>

<p>-v Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>-2 Force two buttons. This means that the middle button,
if any, will be taken as it was the right one.</p>

<p>-3 Force three buttons. By default the mouse is
considered to be a 2-buttons one, until the middle button is
pressed. If three but- tons are there, the right one is used
to extend the selection, and the middle one is used to paste
it. Beware: if you use the -3 option with a 2-buttons mouse,
you wont be able to paste the selection.</p>

<p>OPERATION To select text press the left mouse button and
drag the mouse. To paste text in the same or another
console, press the middle button. The right button is used
to extend the selection, like in xterm.</p>

<p>Two-button mice use the right button to paste text.</p>

<p>Double and triple clicks select whole word and whole
lines. Use of the -p option is recommended for best visual
feedback.</p>

<p>If a trailing space after the contents of a line is
highlighted, and if there is no other text on the remainder
of the line, the rest of the line will be selected
automatically. If a number of lines are selected,
highlighted trailing spaces on each line will be removed
from the selection buffer.</p>

<p>Any output on the virtual console holding the selection
will clear the highlighted selection from the screen, to
maintain integrity of the display, although the contents of
the paste buffer will be unaffected.</p>

<p>The selection mechanism is disabled if the controlling
virtual console is placed in graphics mode, for example when
running X11, and is re- enabled when text mode is resumed.
(But see BUGS section below.)</p>

<p>BUGS The gpm server may have problems interacting with
X: if your mouse is a single-open device (i.e. a bus mouse),
you should kill gpm before starting X, or use the -R option
(see above). To kill gpm just invoke gpm -k. This problem
doesnt apply to serial mice.</p>

<p>Two instances of gpm cant run on the same system. If you
have two mice use the -M option (see above).</p>

<p>While the current console is in graphic mode, gpm sleeps
until text mode is back (unless -R is used). Thus, it wont
reply to clients. Any- ways, it is unlikely that mouse-eager
clients will spur out in hidden consoles.</p>

<p>The clients shipped out with gpm are not updated, thus
there are poten- tial security risks when using them.</p>
