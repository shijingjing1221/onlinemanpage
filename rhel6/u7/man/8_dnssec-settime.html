<p>DNSSEC-SETTIME(8) BIND9 DNSSEC-SETTIME(8)</p>

<p>NAME dnssec-settime - Set the key timing metadata for a
DNSSEC key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dnssec-settime [-f] [-K directory] [-P
date/offset] [-A date/offset] [-R date/offset] [-I
date/offset] [-D date/offset] [-h] [-v level] [-E engine]
{keyfile}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dnssec-settime reads a DNSSEC private key
file and sets the key timing metadata as specified by the
-P, -A, -R, -I, and -D options. The metadata can then be
used by dnssec-signzone or other signing software to
determine when a key is to be published, whether it should
be used for signing a zone, etc.</p>

<p>If none of these options is set on the command line,
then dnssec-settime simply prints the key timing metadata
already stored in the key.</p>

<p>When key metadata fields are changed, both files of a
key pair (Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key and Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private)
are regenerated. Metadata fields are stored in the private
file. A human-readable description of the metadata is also
placed in comments in the key file. The private file s
permissions are always set to be inaccessible to anyone
other than the owner (mode 0600).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Force an update of an old-format key with no
metadata fields. Without this option, dnssec-settime will
fail when attempting to update a legacy key. With this
option, the key will be recreated in the new format, but
with the original key data retained. The keys creation date
will be set to the present time. If no other values are
specified, then the key s publication and activation dates
will also be set to the present time.</p>

<p>-K directory Sets the directory in which the key files
are to reside.</p>

<p>-h Emit usage message and exit.</p>

<p>-v level Sets the debugging level.</p>

<p>-E engine Use the given OpenSSL engine. When compiled
with PKCS#11 support it defaults to pkcs11; the empty name
resets it to no engine.</p>

<p>TIMING OPTIONS Dates can be expressed in the format
YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a +
or -, it is interpreted as an offset from the present time.
For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one of the
suffixes y, mo, w, d, h, or mi, then the offset is computed
in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or
minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is
computed in seconds. To unset a date, use none.</p>

<p>-P date/offset Sets the date on which a key is to be
published to the zone. After that date, the key will be
included in the zone but will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p>-A date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
activated. After that date, the key will be included in the
zone and used to sign it.</p>

<p>-R date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
revoked. After that date, the key will be flagged as
revoked. It will be included in the zone and will be used to
sign it.</p>

<p>-I date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
retired. After that date, the key will still be included in
the zone, but it will not be used to sign it.</p>

<p>-D date/offset Sets the date on which the key is to be
deleted. After that date, the key will no longer be included
in the zone. (It may remain in the key repository,
however.)</p>

<p>-S predecessor key Select a key for which the key being
modified will be an explicit successor. The name, algorithm,
size, and type of the predecessor key must exactly match
those of the key being modified. The activation date of the
successor key will be set to the inactivation date of the
predecessor. The publication date will be set to the
activation date minus the prepublication interval, which
defaults to 30 days.</p>

<p>-i interval Sets the prepublication interval for a key.
If set, then the publication and activation dates must be
separated by at least this much time. If the activation date
is specified but the publication date isn t, then the
publication date will default to this much time before the
activation date; conversely, if the publication date is
specified but activation date isnt, then activation will be
set to this much time after publication.</p>

<p>If the key is being set to be an explicit successor to
another key, then the default prepublication interval is 30
days; otherwise it is zero.</p>

<p>As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one
of the suffixes y, mo, w, d, h, or mi, then the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in
seconds.</p>

<p>PRINTING OPTIONS dnssec-settime can also be used to
print the timing metadata associated with a key.</p>

<p>-u Print times in UNIX epoch format.</p>

<p>-p C/P/A/R/I/D/all Print a specific metadata value or
set of metadata values. The -p option may be followed by one
or more of the following letters to indicate which value or
values to print: C for the creation date, P for the
publication date, A for the activation date, R for the
revocation date, I for the inactivation date, or D for the
deletion date. To print all of the metadata, use -p all.</p>
