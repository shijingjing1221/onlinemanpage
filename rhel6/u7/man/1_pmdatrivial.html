<p>NAME pmdatrivial - trivial performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/pmdatrivial [-d domain]
[-l logfile] [-U user- name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdatrivial is the simplest possible
Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports a
single performance metric, the time in seconds since the 1st
of January, 1970.</p>

<p>The trivial PMDA is shipped as source code and is
designed to be an aid for PMDA developers.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdatrivial command line
options follows:</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named triv- ial.log is written in the current directory of
pmcd(1) when pmda- trivial is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log file can- not be created or is
not writable, output is written to the stan- dard error
instead.</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account in
current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser
account (&quot;root&quot;) was used by default.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the trivial performance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdatrivial is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdatrivial $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/help default help
text file for the trivial metrics
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Install installation script for the
pmdatrivial agent $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Remove undo
installation script for the pmdatrivial agent
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/trivial.log default log file for error
messages and other information from pmdatrivial</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
