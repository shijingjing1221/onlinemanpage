<p>Tk_HandleEvent(3) Tk Library Procedures
Tk_HandleEvent(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_HandleEvent - invoke event handlers for window
system events</p>

<p>Tk_HandleEvent(eventPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS XEvent *eventPtr (in) Pointer to X event to
dispatch to rele- vant handler(s).
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tk_HandleEvent is a lower-level procedure
that deals with window events. It is called by
Tcl_ServiceEvent (and indirectly by Tk_DoOneEvent), and in a
few other cases within Tk. It makes callbacks to any window
event handlers (created by calls to Tk_CreateEven- tHandler)
that match eventPtr and then returns. In some cases it may
be useful for an application to bypass the Tk event queue
and call Tk_HandleEvent directly instead of calling
Tcl_QueueEvent followed by Tcl_ServiceEvent.</p>

<p>This procedure may be invoked recursively. For example,
it is possible to invoke Tk_HandleEvent recursively from a
handler called by Tk_Han- dleEvent. This sort of operation
is useful in some modal situations, such as when a notifier
has been popped up and an application wishes to wait for the
user to click a button in the notifier before doing any-
thing else.</p>
