<p>NAME starting - event signalling that a job is
starting</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS starting JOB=JOB INSTANCE=INSTANCE [ENV]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The starting event is generated by the
Upstart init(8) daemon when a new instance of a job begins
starting. The JOB environment variable contains the job
name, and the INSTANCE environment variable contains the
instance name which will be empty for single-instance
jobs.</p>

<p>init(8) will wait for all services started by this event
to be running, all tasks started by this event to have
finished and all jobs stopped by this event to be stopped
before allowing the job to continue start- ing.</p>

<p>This allows jobs to effectively insert themselves as
dependencies of other jobs. The event is typically combined
with the stopped(7) event by services.</p>

<p>Job configuration files may use the export stanza to
export environment variables from their own environment into
the starting event. See init(5) for more details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE A service that wishes to be running whenever
another service would be running, started before and stopped
after it, might use:</p>

<p>start on starting apache stop on stopped apache</p>

<p>A task that must be run before another task or service
is started might use:</p>

<p>start on starting postgresql</p>
