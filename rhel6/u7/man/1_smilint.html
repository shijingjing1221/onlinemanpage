<p>NAME smilint - syntax and semantic checks of SMIv1/v2
and SPPI modules</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smilint [ -Vhersm ] [ -c file ] [ -p module ] [
-l level ] [ -i error- pattern ] module(s)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The smilint program is used to check MIB or
PIB modules for syntax errors and semantics at some degree.
SMIv1/v2 style MIB modules as well as SPPI PIB modules are
supported.</p>

<p>The rules that smilint is based on are taken from RFC
1155, RFC 1212 and RFC 1215 for SMIv1, RFCs 2578-2580 for
SMIv2, RFC 3159 for SPPI.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V, --version Show the smilint version and
exit.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show a help text and exit.</p>

<p>-e, --error-list Show a list of all known error messages
and exit. Error messages can have associated tags, shown in
braces at the end of each line. The tags can be used with
the -i option to ignore certain error messages.</p>

<p>-r, --recursive Report errors and warnings also for
recursively imported mod- ules.</p>

<p>-s, --severity Show the error severity in brackets
before error messages.</p>

<p>-m, --error-names Show the error names in braces before
error messages.</p>

<p>-c file, --config=file Read file instead of any other
(global and user) configuration file.</p>

<p>-p module, --preload=module Preload the module module
before reading the main module(s). This may be helpful if an
incomplete main module misses to import some
definitions.</p>

<p>-l level, --level=level Report errors and warnings up to
the given severity level. See below for a description of the
error levels. The default error level is 3.</p>

<p>-i prefix, --ignore=prefix Ignore all errors that have a
tag which matches prefix. A list of error tags can be
retrieved by calling smilint with the -e option.</p>

<p>module(s) These are the modules to be checked. If a
module argument repre- sents a path name (identified by
containing at least one dot or slash character), this is
assumed to be the exact file to read. Otherwise, if a module
is identified by its plain module name, it is searched
according to libsmi internal rules. See smi_con- fig(3) for
more details.</p>

<p>ERROR AND WARNING LEVELS All generated error and warning
messages have an associated severity level. The actual
severity levels are:</p>

<p>0 Internal error, no recovery possible. Examples are
memory allocation failures. Errors of this level usually
cause the application to abort.</p>

<p>1 Major SMI/SPPI error, recovery somehow possible but
may lead to severe problems. Examples are lexically
unexpected characters or unknown keywords. Errors of this
kind usually lead to follow-on errors.</p>

<p>2 SMI/SPPI error which is probably tolerated by some
implementations. Examples are MIB/PIB modules which mix
constructs from different SMI/SPPI versions.</p>

<p>3 SMI/SPPI error which is likely tolerated by many
implementations. Examples are misplaced SMIv2
MODULE-IDENTITY invocations or SMIv2 textual conventions
derived from other textual conventions.</p>

<p>4 Something which is not strictly an error but which is
recommended to be changed. Warnings of this level are
usually considered during MIB reviews.</p>

<p>5 Something that is basically correct but might be
problematic in cer- tain environments or usage scenarios.
Examples are warnings that identifiers only differ in case
or that type definitions are not used within the defining
module.</p>

<p>6 Messages of this level are auxiliary notices. Examples
are messages that point to a previous definition in case of
a redefinition.</p>

<p>Higher levels are currently not used and lead to the
same effects as level 6 does. Note that errors up to level 3
are errors violating the specifications and must be fixed by
the responsible author. The warn- ings generated with level
4 should be considered during normal MIB/PIB reviews.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This example checks the file RMON2-MIB in the
current directory (note that the ./ prefix ensures this).
The error level is raised to 6 and warnings that claim about
identifier names that exceed a length of 32 characters are
suppressed.</p>

<p>$ smilint -l 6 -i namelength-32 ./RMON2-MIB
./RMON2-MIB:3935: unexpected type restriction
./RMON2-MIB:3936: unexpected type restriction
./RMON2-MIB:3937: unexpected type restriction
./RMON2-MIB:3938: unexpected type restriction
./RMON2-MIB:3939: unexpected type restriction
./RMON2-MIB:3940: unexpected type restriction
./RMON2-MIB:4164: scalar object must not have a read-create
access value</p>
