<p>NAME XmClipboardCancelCopy A clipboard function that
cancels a copy to the clipboard</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/CutPaste.h&gt; int
XmClipboardCancelCopy (display, window, item_id) Display *
display; Window window; long item_id; (void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardCancelCopy cancels the copy to
clipboard that is in progress and frees up temporary
storage. When a copy is to be performed,
XmClipboardStartCopy allocates temporary storage for the
clipboard data. XmClipboardCopy copies the appropriate data
into the the tempo- rary storage. XmClipboardEndCopy copies
the data to the clipboard structure and frees up the
temporary storage structures. If XmClip- boardCancelCopy is
called, the XmClipboardEndCopy function does not have to be
called. A call to XmClipboardCancelCopy is valid only after
a call to XmClipboardStartCopy.</p>

<p>display Specifies a pointer to the Display structure
that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

<p>window Specifies a widgets window ID that relates the
application window to the clipboard. The widgets window ID
can be obtained through XtWindow. The same application
instance should pass the same window ID to each of the
clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

<p>item_id Specifies the number assigned to this data item.
This number was returned by a previous call to
XmClipboardStartCopy.</p>

<p>RETURN XmClipboardSuccess The function was
successful.</p>

<p>XmClipboardLocked The function failed because the
clipboard was locked by another application. The application
can continue to call the function again with the same
parameters until the lock goes away. This gives the
application the opportunity to ask if the user wants to keep
trying or to give up on the operation.</p>

<p>XmClipboardFail The function failed because
XmClipboardStartCopy was not called or because the data item
contains too many formats.</p>

<p>RELATED XmClipboardCopy(3), XmClipboardEndCopy(3), and
XmClipboardStartCopy(3).</p>
