<p>KPSEACCESS(1) KPSEACCESS(1)</p>

<p>NAME kpseaccess - determine whether a file can be
accessed</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS kpseaccess [-rwx] file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Exit successfully if file can be accessed
with the specified mode. The mode is one or more letters of
rwx, where r is for readable, w is for writable, and x is
for executable.</p>

<p>The difference between kpseaccess and test is that the
latter looks at the permission bits, while the former checks
using the access(2) system call. This makes a difference
when file systems have been mounted read-only.</p>

<p>OPTIONS kpseaccess accepts the following additional
options:</p>

<p>--help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>--version Print version information and exit.</p>
