<p>WCSTOD(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WCSTOD(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME wcstod, wcstof, wcstold - convert a wide-character
string to a double- precision number</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>double wcstod(const wchar_t *restrict nptr, wchar_t
**restrict endptr); float wcstof(const wchar_t *restrict
nptr, wchar_t **restrict endptr); long double wcstold(const
wchar_t *restrict nptr, wchar_t **restrict endptr);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions shall convert the initial
portion of the wide-character string pointed to by nptr to
double, float, and long double representa- tion,
respectively. First, they shall decompose the input
wide-charac- ter string into three parts:</p>

<p>1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space
wide-character codes (as specified by iswspace())</p>

<p>2. A subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point
constant or rep- resenting infinity or NaN</p>

<p>3. A final wide-character string of one or more
unrecognized wide- character codes, including the
terminating null wide-character code of the input
wide-character string</p>

<p>Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence
to a floating- point number, and return the result.</p>

<p>The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional
plus or minus sign, then one of the following:</p>

<p>* A non-empty sequence of decimal digits optionally
containing a radix character, then an optional exponent
part</p>

<p>* A 0x or 0X, then a non-empty sequence of hexadecimal
digits option- ally containing a radix character, then an
optional binary exponent part</p>

<p>* One of INF or INFINITY, or any other wide string
equivalent except for case</p>

<p>* One of NAN or NAN(n-wchar-sequence_opt), or any other
wide string ignoring case in the NAN part, where:</p>

<p>n-wchar-sequence: digit nondigit n-wchar-sequence digit
n-wchar-sequence nondigit</p>

<p>The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
subsequence of the input wide string, starting with the
first non-white-space wide character, that is of the
expected form. The subject sequence contains no wide
characters if the input wide string is not of the expected
form.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the expected form for a
floating-point num- ber, the sequence of wide characters
starting with the first digit or the radix character
(whichever occurs first) shall be interpreted as a floating
constant according to the rules of the C language, except
that the radix character shall be used in place of a period,
and that if neither an exponent part nor a radix character
appears in a decimal floating-point number, or if a binary
exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal
floating-point number, an exponent part of the appropri- ate
type with value zero shall be assumed to follow the last
digit in the string. If the subject sequence begins with a
minus sign, the sequence shall be interpreted as negated. A
wide-character sequence INF or INFINITY shall be interpreted
as an infinity, if representable in the return type, else as
if it were a floating constant that is too large for the
range of the return type. A wide-character sequence NAN or
NAN(n-wchar-sequence_opt) shall be interpreted as a quiet
NaN, if supported in the return type, else as if it were a
subject sequence part that does not have the expected form;
the meaning of the n-wchar sequences is
implementation-defined. A pointer to the final wide string
shall be stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided
that endptr is not a null pointer.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and
FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the conversion shall be rounded
in an implementation- defined manner.</p>

<p>The radix character shall be as defined in the programs
locale (cate- gory LC_NUMERIC ). In the POSIX locale, or in
a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix
character shall default to a period (.).</p>

<p>In other than the C or POSIX locales, other
implementation-defined subject sequences may be
accepted.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the
expected form, no conversion shall be performed; the value
of nptr shall be stored in the object pointed to by endptr,
provided that endptr is not a null pointer.</p>

<p>The wcstod() function shall not change the setting of
errno if success- ful.</p>

<p>Since 0 is returned on error and is also a valid return
on success, an application wishing to check for error
situations should set errno to 0, then call wcstod(),
wcstof(), or wcstold(), then check errno.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the converted value. If no conversion could be
performed, 0 shall be returned and errno may be set to
[EINVAL].</p>

<p>If the correct value is outside the range of
representable values, &plusmn;HUGE_VAL, &plusmn;HUGE_VALF,
or &plusmn;HUGE_VALL shall be returned (according to the
sign of the value), and errno shall be set to [ERANGE].</p>

<p>If the correct value would cause underflow, a value
whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest normalized
positive number in the return type shall be returned and
errno set to [ERANGE].</p>

<p>ERRORS The wcstod() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>ERANGE The value to be returned would cause overflow or
underflow.</p>

<p>The wcstod() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL No conversion could be performed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE If the subject sequence has the
hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, and the
result is not exactly representable, the result should be
one of the two numbers in the appropriate internal format
that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating source value,
with the extra stipulation that the error should have a
correct sign for the current rounding direction.</p>

<p>If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most
DECIMAL_DIG (defined in &lt;float.h&gt;) significant digits,
the result should be cor- rectly rounded. If the subject
sequence D has the decimal form and more than DECIMAL_DIG
significant digits, consider the two bounding, adja- cent
decimal strings L and U, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant
dig- its, such that the values of L, D, and U satisfy
&quot;L &lt;= D &lt;= U&quot; . The result should be one of
the (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained by
correctly rounding L and U according to the current round-
ing direction, with the extra stipulation that the error
with respect to D should have a correct sign for the current
rounding direction.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
