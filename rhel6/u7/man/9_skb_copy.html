<p>NAME skb_copy - create private copy of an sk_buff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct sk_buff * skb_copy(const struct sk_buff
* skb, gfp_t gfp_mask);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS skb buffer to copy</p>

<p>gfp_mask allocation priority</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Make a copy of both an sk_buff and its data.
This is used when the caller wishes to modify the data and
needs a private copy of the data to alter. Returns NULL on
failure or the pointer to the buffer on success. The
returned buffer has a reference count of 1.</p>

<p>As by-product this function converts non-linear sk_buff
to linear one, so that sk_buff becomes completely private
and caller is allowed to modify all the data of returned
buffer. This means that this function is not recommended for
use in circumstances when only header is going to be
modified. Use pskb_copy instead.</p>
