<p>FAKECHROOT(1) FAKECHROOT(1)</p>

<p>NAME fakechroot - gives a fake chroot environment</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fakechroot [-s|--use-system-libs] [-l|--lib
library] [--] [command]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fakechroot runs a command in an environment
were is additional possibility to use chroot(8) command
without root privileges. This is useful for allowing users
to create own chrooted environment with possibility to
install another packages without need for root
privileges.</p>

<p>fakechroot replaces more library functions (chroot(2),
open(2), etc.) by ones that simulate the effect the real
library functions would have had, had the user really been
in chroot. These wrapper functions are in a shared library
/usr/lib/fakechroot/libfakechroot.so which is loaded through
the LD_PRELOAD mechanism of the dynamic loader. (See
ld.so(8))</p>

<p>In fake chroot you can install Debian bootstrap with
debootstrap --variant=fakechroot command. In this
environment you can use i.e. apt-get(8) command to install
another packages from common users account.</p>

<p>In the current version, the fakechroot does not provide
the fakeroot(1) functionality! You might to call fakechroot
with fakeroot command, if you want to emulate root
environment, i.e.:</p>

<p>$ fakeroot fakechroot /usr/sbin/chroot /tmp/debian
/bin/sh # id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l library|--lib library Specify an alternative
wrapper library.</p>

<p>-s|--use-system-libs Use system libraries before chroots
libraries. This might be a workaround if system dynamic
linker (/lib/ld-linux.so.2 for Linux) can not load libc.so
from fake chroot.</p>

<p>Try this setting if you noticed following errors:</p>

<p>$ fakechroot /usr/sbin/chroot /tmp/sarge /bin/true
/bin/true: relocation error: /srv/sarge/lib/tls/libc.so.6:
symbol _dl _starting_up, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined
in file ld-linux.so.2 with link time reference</p>

<p>$ fakechroot /usr/sbin/chroot /tmp/centos4 /bin/true
Segmentation fault</p>

<p>[--] command Any command you want to be ran as
fakechroot. Use -- if in the command you have other options
that may confuse fakechroots option parsing.</p>

<p>-h Display help.</p>

<p>-v Display version.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES An example session with fakechroot:</p>

<p>$ export
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin
:/bin:/usr/bin/X11 $ fakeroot -s fakechroot.save fakechroot
debootstrap --variant=fakech root lenny /tmp/lenny</p>

<p>$ fakeroot -i fakechroot.save fakechroot chroot
/tmp/lenny /bin/bash # cd / # sh
/usr/share/doc/fakechroot/examples/savemode.sh # echo deb
http://ftp.debian.org/debian lenny main contrib non-free
&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list # echo deb-src
http://ftp.debian.org/debian lenny main contrib non-fr ee
&gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list # apt-get update # apt-get
install adduser whiptail build-essential devscripts #
adduser --uid 1001 user # cd /tmp # apt-get source hello #
cd hello-* # debuild --preserve-env -b # exit</p>

<p>SECURITY ASPECTS fakechroot is a regular, non-setuid
program. It does not enhance a users privileges, or decrease
the systems security.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/lib/fakechroot/libfakechroot.so The shared
library containing the wrapper functions.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT FAKECHROOT The value is true for fake chroot
environment.</p>

<p>FAKECHROOT_VERSION The version of current fakechroot
library.</p>

<p>FAKECHROOT_BASE The root directory for fake chroot
environment.</p>

<p>FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH The list of directories which
are excluded from being chrooted. The elements of list are
separated with colon.</p>

<p>FAKECHROOT_CMD_SUBST A list of command substitutions. If
a program tries to execute one of the commands given (path
relative to the chroot) then the substitute command runs
instead (path to substitute command is not chrooted).</p>

<p>For example:</p>


<p>FAKECHROOT_CMD_SUBST=/sbin/ldconfig=/tmp/ldconfig-wrapper</p>

<p>will substitute &quot;/tmp/ldconfig-wrapper&quot; for
&quot;/sbin/ldconfig&quot;.</p>

<p>Give as many substitute commands as you want, separated
by &quot;:&quot; (colon) characters.</p>

<p>LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD Fakechroot is implemented by
wrapping system calls. This is accomplished by setting
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/fakechroot and
LD_PRELOAD=libfakechroot.so. That library is loaded before
the system s C library, and so most of the library functions
are intercepted by it. If you need to set either
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD from within a fakechroot
environment, it should be set relative to the given paths,
as in LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/foo/bar/</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS o /lib/ld-linux.so.2 is always loaded from
real environment. This path is hardcoded by linker for all
binaries.</p>

<p>o Every command executed within fakechroot needs to be
linked to the same version of the C library as fakechroot
itself. If the libraries in chroot are not compatible, try
to use --use-system-libs option.</p>

<p>o You can provide symlinks to the outside. The symlink
have to be created before chroot is called. It can be useful
for accessing the real /proc and /dev directory. You can
also set the FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH environment
variable:</p>

<p>$ export
FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH=/tmp:/proc:/dev:/var/run</p>

<p>o Statically linked binaries doesnt work, especially
ldconfig(8), so you have to wrap this command with dummy
version and i.e. set the dpkg diversion, see:
dpkg-divert(8).</p>

<p>o ldd(1) also doesnt work. You have to use &quot;alias
ldd=&rsquo;LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1&rsquo;&quot; or to use
a wrapper instead. The example wrapper is available at
scripts/ directory in fakechroots source package and it is
located at /usr/share/doc/fakechroot/examples directory.</p>

<p>o The full screen applications hangs up if /dev/tty file
is not a real device. Link /dev/tty file or whole /dev
directory to the real one or remove it from fake chroot
environment.</p>

<p>o lckpwdf() and ulckpwdf() are ignored so passwd(1)
command should work</p>

<p>o Your real uid should exist in /etc/passwd. Create it
with adduser --uid realuid realuser.</p>

<p>o debuild(1) cleans environment. Use --preserve-env
option to prevent this behaviour.</p>
