<p>D_SPLICE_ALIAS(9) The Linux VFS D_SPLICE_ALIAS(9)</p>

<p>NAME d_splice_alias - splice a disconnected dentry into
the tree if one exists</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct dentry * d_splice_alias(struct inode *
inode, struct dentry * dentry);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS inode the inode which may have a disconnected
dentry</p>

<p>dentry a negative dentry which we want to point to the
inode.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If inode is a directory and has a
&acute;disconnected&acute; dentry (i.e. IS_ROOT and
DCACHE_DISCONNECTED), then d_move that in place of the given
dentry and return it, else simply d_add the inode to the
dentry and return NULL.</p>

<p>This is needed in the lookup routine of any filesystem
that is exportable (via knfsd) so that we can build dcache
paths to directories effectively.</p>

<p>If a dentry was found and moved, then it is returned.
Otherwise NULL is returned. This matches the expected return
value of -&gt;lookup.</p>
