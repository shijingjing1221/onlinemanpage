<p>GXL2GV,GV2GXL(1) GXL2GV,GV2GXL(1)</p>

<p>NAME gxl2gv,gv2gxl - GXL-GV converters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gxl2gv [ -gd? ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ] gv2gxl
[ -gd? ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gxl2gv converts between graphs represented
in GXL and in the GV lan- guage. Unless a conversion type is
specified using a flag, gxl2gv will deduce the type of
conversion from the suffix of the input file, a
&quot;.gv&quot; (or a &quot;.dot&quot;) suffix causing a
conversion from GV to GXL, and a &quot;.gxl&quot; suffix
causing a conversion from GXL to GV. If no suffix is
available, e.g. when the input is from a pipe, and no flags
are used then gxl2gv assumes the type of the input file from
its executable name so that gxl2gv converts from GXL to GV,
and gv2gxl converts from GV to GXL.</p>

<p>GXL supports a much richer graph model than GV. gxl2gv
will attempt to map GXL constructs into the analogous GV
construct when this is possi- ble. If not, the GXL
information is stored as an attribute. The inten- tion is
that applying gxl2gv|gv2gxl is semantically equivalent to
the identity operator.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-g The command name and input file extensions are
ignored, the input is taken as a GV file and a GXL file is
generated.</p>

<p>-d The command name and input file extensions are
ignored, the input is taken as a GXL file and a GV file is
generated.</p>

<p>-? Prints usage information and exits.</p>

<p>-o outfile If specified, the output will be written into
the file outfile. Otherwise, output is written to standard
out.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>files Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in GXL
or GV. If no files operand is specified, the standard input
will be used.</p>

<p>RETURN CODES Both gxl2gv and gv2gxl return 0 if there
were no problems during con- version; and non-zero if any
error occurred.</p>

<p>BUGS gxl2gv will only convert in one direction even if
given multiple files with varying suffixes.</p>

<p>The conversion can only handle one graph per GXL
file.</p>

<p>There are some GXL constructs which gxl2gv cannot
handle.</p>
