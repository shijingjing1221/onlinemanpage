<p>ACL_CREATE_ENTRY(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_CREATE_ENTRY(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_create_entry - create a new ACL entry</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/acl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acl_create_entry(acl_t *acl_p, acl_entry_t
*entry_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_create_entry() function creates a
new ACL entry in the ACL pointed to by the contents of the
pointer argument acl_p. On success, the function returns a
descriptor for the new ACL entry via entry_p.</p>

<p>This function may cause memory to be allocated. The
caller should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL
is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3) with
(void*)*acl_p as an argument. If the ACL working stor- age
cannot be increased in the current location, then the
working storage for the ACL pointed to by acl_p may be
relocated and the previous working storage is released. A
pointer to the new working storage is returned via
acl_p.</p>

<p>The components of the new ACL entry are initialized in
the following ways: the ACL tag type component contains
ACL_UNDEFINED_TAG, the quali- fier component contains
ACL_UNDEFINED_ID, and the set of permissions has no
permissions enabled. Any existing ACL entry descriptors that
refer to entries in the ACL continue to refer to those
entries.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The acl_create_entry() function returns the
value 0 if successful; other- wise the value -1 is returned
and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_create_entry() function returns -1 and sets errno to the
corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EINVAL] The argument acl_p is not a valid pointer to an
ACL.</p>

<p>[ENOMEM] The ACL working storage requires more memory
than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory
man- agement constraints.</p>

<p>STANDARDS IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e,
abandoned)</p>
