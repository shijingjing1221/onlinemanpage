<p>PTHREAD_EXIT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_EXIT(3)</p>

<p>NAME pthread_exit - terminate calling thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>void pthread_exit(void *retval);</p>

<p>Compile and link with -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_exit() function terminates the
calling thread and returns a value via retval that (if the
thread is joinable) is available to another thread in the
same process that calls pthread_join(3).</p>

<p>Any clean-up handlers established by
pthread_cleanup_push(3) that have not yet been popped, are
popped (in the reverse of the order in which they were
pushed) and executed. If the thread has any thread-specific
data, then, after the clean-up handlers have been executed,
the corre- sponding destructor functions are called, in an
unspecified order.</p>

<p>When a thread terminates, process-shared resources
(e.g., mutexes, con- dition variables, semaphores, and file
descriptors) are not released, and functions registered
using atexit(3) are not called.</p>

<p>After the last thread in a process terminates, the
process terminates as by calling exit(3) with an exit status
of zero; thus, process-shared resources are released and
functions registered using atexit(3) are called.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function does not return to the
caller.</p>

<p>ERRORS This function always succeeds.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Performing a return from the start function of any
thread other than the main thread results in an implicit
call to pthread_exit(), using the functions return value as
the threads exit status.</p>

<p>To allow other threads to continue execution, the main
thread should terminate by calling pthread_exit() rather
than exit(3).</p>

<p>The value pointed to by retval should not be located on
the calling thread s stack, since the contents of that stack
are undefined after the thread terminates.</p>

<p>BUGS Currently, there are limitations in the kernel
implementation logic for wait(2)ing on a stopped thread
group with a dead thread group leader. This can manifest in
problems such as a locked terminal if a stop sig- nal is
sent to a foreground process whose thread group leader has
already called pthread_exit(3).</p>
