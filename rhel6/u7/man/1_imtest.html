<p>NAME imtest - interactive IMAP test program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS imtest [ -t keyfile ] [ -p port ] [ -m
mechanism ] [ -a userid ] [ -u userid ] [ -k num ] [ -l num
] [ -r realm ] [ -f file ] [ -n num ] [ -s ] [ -q ] [ -c ] [
-i ] [ -z ] [ -v ] [ -I file ] [ -x file ] [ -X file ] [ -o
option=value ] hostname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION imtest is a utility that allows you to
authenticate to a IMAP or IMSP server and interactively
issue commands to it. Once authenticated you may issue any
IMAP or IMSP command by simply typing it in. It is capa- ble
of multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles
encryption layers transparently. This utility is often used
for testing the opera- tion of a imsp or imap server. Also
those developing IMAP clients find it useful.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -t keyfile Enable TLS. keyfile contains the TLS
public and private keys. Specify &quot;&quot; to negotiate a
TLS encryption layer but not use TLS authentication.</p>

<p>-p port Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to
imap as defined in /etc/services.</p>

<p>-m mechanism Force imtest to use mechanism for
authentication. If not speci- fied the strongest
authentication mechanism supported by the server is chosen.
Specify login to use the LOGIN command instead of
AUTHENTICATE.</p>

<p>-a userid Userid to use for authentication; defaults to
the current user. This is the userid whose password or
credentials will be pre- sented to the server for
verification.</p>

<p>-u userid Userid to use for authorization; defaults to
the current user. This is the userid whose identity will be
assumed after authen- tication. NOTE: This is only used with
SASL mechanisms that allow proxying (e.g. PLAIN,
DIGEST-MD5).</p>

<p>-k num Minimum protection layer required.</p>

<p>-l num Maximum protection layer to use (0=none;
1=integrity; etc). For example if you are using the
KERBEROS_V4 authentication mecha- nism specifying 0 will
force imtest to not use any layer and specifying 1 will
force it to use the integrity layer. By default the maximum
supported protection layer will be used.</p>

<p>-r realm Specify the realm to use. Certain
authentication mechanisms (e.g. DIGEST-MD5) may require one
to specify the realm.</p>

<p>-f file Pipe file into connection after
authentication.</p>

<p>-n num Number of authentication attempts; default = 1.
The client will attempt to do SSL/TLS session reuse and/or
fast reauth (e.g. DIGEST-MD5), if possible.</p>

<p>-s Enable IMAP over SSL (imaps).</p>

<p>-q Enable IMAP COMPRESSion (before the last
authentication attempt).</p>

<p>-c Enable challenge prompt callbacks. This will cause
the OTP mechanism to ask for the the one-time password
instead of the secret pass-phrase (library generates the
correct response).</p>

<p>-i Don t send an initial client response for SASL
mechanisms, even if the protocol supports it.</p>

<p>-I file Echo the PID of the running process into file
(This can be use- ful with -X).</p>

<p>-x file Open the named socket for the interactive
portion</p>

<p>-X file Like -x, only close all file descriptors &amp;
daemonize the pro- cess.</p>

<p>-o option=value Set the SASL option to value.</p>

<p>-v Verbose. Print out more information than usual.</p>

<p>-z Timing test.</p>
