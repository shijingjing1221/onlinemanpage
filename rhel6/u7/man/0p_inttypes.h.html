<p>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;(0P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
&lt;inttypes.h&gt;(0P)</p>

<p>NAME inttypes.h - fixed size integer types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Some of the functionality described on this
reference page extends the ISO C standard. Applications
shall define the appropriate feature test macro (see the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Sec- tion
2.2, The Compilation Environment) to enable the visibility
of these symbols in this header.</p>

<p>The &lt;inttypes.h&gt; header shall include the
&lt;stdint.h&gt; header.</p>

<p>The &lt;inttypes.h&gt; header shall include a definition
of at least the fol- lowing type:</p>

<p>imaxdiv_t Structure type that is the type of the value
returned by the imaxdiv() function.</p>

<p>The following macros shall be defined. Each expands to a
character string literal containing a conversion specifier,
possibly modified by a length modifier, suitable for use
within the format argument of a formatted input/output
function when converting the corresponding inte- ger type.
These macros have the general form of PRI (character string
literals for the fprintf() and fwprintf() family of
functions) or SCN (character string literals for the
fscanf() and fwscanf() family of functions), followed by the
conversion specifier, followed by a name corresponding to a
similar type name in &lt;stdint.h&gt;. In these names, N
represents the width of the type as described in
&lt;stdint.h&gt;. For exam- ple, PRIdFAST32 can be used in a
format string to print the value of an integer of type
int_fast32_t.</p>

<p>The fprintf() macros for signed integers are:</p>

<p>PRIdN PRIdLEASTN PRIdFASTN PRIdMAX PRIdPTR PRIiN
PRIiLEASTN PRIiFASTN PRIiMAX PRIiPTR</p>

<p>The fprintf() macros for unsigned integers are:</p>

<p>PRIoN PRIoLEASTN PRIoFASTN PRIoMAX PRIoPTR PRIuN
PRIuLEASTN PRIuFASTN PRIuMAX PRIuPTR PRIxN PRIxLEASTN
PRIxFASTN PRIxMAX PRIxPTR PRIXN PRIXLEASTN PRIXFASTN PRIXMAX
PRIXPTR</p>

<p>The fscanf() macros for signed integers are:</p>

<p>SCNdN SCNdLEASTN SCNdFASTN SCNdMAX SCNdPTR SCNiN
SCNiLEASTN SCNiFASTN SCNiMAX SCNiPTR</p>

<p>The fscanf() macros for unsigned integers are:</p>

<p>SCNoN SCNoLEASTN SCNoFASTN SCNoMAX SCNoPTR SCNuN
SCNuLEASTN SCNuFASTN SCNuMAX SCNuPTR SCNxN SCNxLEASTN
SCNxFASTN SCNxMAX SCNxPTR</p>

<p>For each type that the implementation provides in
&lt;stdint.h&gt;, the cor- responding fprintf() and
fwprintf() macros shall be defined and the corresponding
fscanf() and fwscanf() macros shall be defined unless the
implementation does not have a suitable modifier for the
type.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as functions and may
also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be
provided.</p>

<p>intmax_t imaxabs(intmax_t); imaxdiv_t imaxdiv(intmax_t,
intmax_t); intmax_t strtoimax(const char *restrict, char
**restrict, int); uintmax_t strtoumax(const char *restrict,
char **restrict, int); intmax_t wcstoimax(const wchar_t
*restrict, wchar_t **restrict, int); uintmax_t
wcstoumax(const wchar_t *restrict, wchar_t **restrict,
int);</p>

<p>EXAMPLES #include &lt;inttypes.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt; int main(void) { uintmax_t i = UINTMAX_MAX;
// This type always exists. wprintf(L&quot;The largest
integer value is %020&quot; PRIxMAX n&quot;, i); return 0;
}</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The purpose of &lt;inttypes.h&gt; is
to provide a set of integer types whose definitions are
consistent across machines and independent of operating
systems and other implementation idiosyncrasies. It defines,
via type- def, integer types of various sizes.
Implementations are free to type- def them as ISO C standard
integer types or extensions that they sup- port. Consistent
use of this header will greatly increase the portabil- ity
of applications across platforms.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard specified that
the language should sup- port four signed and unsigned
integer data types- char, short, int, and long- but placed
very little requirement on their size other than that int
and short be at least 16 bits and long be at least as long
as int and not smaller than 32 bits. For 16-bit systems,
most implementations assigned 8, 16, 16, and 32 bits to
char, short, int, and long, respec- tively. For 32-bit
systems, the common practice has been to assign 8, 16, 32,
and 32 bits to these types. This difference in int size can
create some problems for users who migrate from one system
to another which assigns different sizes to integer types,
because the ISO C stan- dard integer promotion rule can
produce silent changes unexpectedly. The need for defining
an extended integer type increased with the introduction of
64-bit systems.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS Macro names beginning with PRI or SCN
followed by any lowercase letter orXmay be added to the
macros defined in the &lt;inttypes.h&gt; header.</p>
