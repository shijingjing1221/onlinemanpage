<p>NAME perltidy - a perl script indenter and
reformatter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perltidy [ options ] file1 file2 file3 ...
(output goes to file1.tdy, file2.tdy, file3.tdy, ...)
perltidy [ options ] file1 -o outfile perltidy [ options ]
file1 -st &gt;outfile perltidy [ options ] &lt;infile
&gt;outfile</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Perltidy reads a perl script and writes an
indented, reformatted script.</p>

<p>Many users will find enough information in
&quot;EXAMPLES&quot; to get started. New users may benefit
from the short tutorial which can be found at
http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html</p>

<p>A convenient aid to systematically defining a set of
style parameters can be found at
http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/stylekey.html</p>

<p>Perltidy can produce output on either of two modes,
depending on the existence of an -html flag. Without this
flag, the output is passed through a formatter. The default
formatting tries to follow the recommendations in
perlstyle(1), but it can be controlled in detail with
numerous input parameters, which are described in
&quot;FORMATTING OPTIONS&quot;.</p>

<p>When the -html flag is given, the output is passed
through an HTML formatter which is described in &quot;HTML
OPTIONS&quot;.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES perltidy somefile.pl</p>

<p>This will produce a file somefile.pl.tdy containing the
script reformatted using the default options, which
approximate the style suggested in perlstyle(1). Perltidy
never changes the input file.</p>

<p>perltidy *.pl</p>

<p>Execute perltidy on all .pl files in the current
directory with the default options. The output will be in
files with an appended .tdy extension. For any file with an
error, there will be a file with extension .ERR.</p>

<p>perltidy -b file1.pl file2.pl</p>

<p>Modify file1.pl and file2.pl in place, and backup the
originals to file1.pl.bak and file2.pl.bak. If file1.pl.bak
and/or file2.pl.bak already exist, they will be
overwritten.</p>

<p>perltidy -gnu somefile.pl</p>

<p>Execute perltidy on file somefile.pl with a style which
approximates the GNU Coding Standards for C programs. The
output will be somefile.pl.tdy.</p>

<p>perltidy -i=3 somefile.pl</p>

<p>Execute perltidy on file somefile.pl, with 3 columns for
each level of indentation (-i=3) instead of the default 4
columns. There will not be any tabs in the reformatted
script, except for any which already exist in comments, pod
documents, quotes, and here documents. Output will be
somefile.pl.tdy.</p>

<p>perltidy -i=3 -et=8 somefile.pl</p>

<p>Same as the previous example, except that leading
whitespace will be entabbed with one tab character per 8
spaces.</p>

<p>perltidy -ce -l=72 somefile.pl</p>

<p>Execute perltidy on file somefile.pl with all defaults
except use &quot;cuddled elses&quot; (-ce) and a maximum
line length of 72 columns (-l=72) instead of the default 80
columns.</p>

<p>perltidy -g somefile.pl</p>

<p>Execute perltidy on file somefile.pl and save a log file
somefile.pl.LOG which shows the nesting of braces,
parentheses, and square brackets at the start of every
line.</p>

<p>perltidy -html somefile.pl</p>

<p>This will produce a file somefile.pl.html containing the
script with html markup. The output file will contain an
embedded style sheet in the &lt;HEAD&gt; section which may
be edited to change the appearance.</p>

<p>perltidy -html -css=mystyle.css somefile.pl</p>

<p>This will produce a file somefile.pl.html containing the
script with html markup. This output file will contain a
link to a separate style sheet file mystyle.css. If the file
mystyle.css does not exist, it will be created. If it
exists, it will not be overwritten.</p>

<p>perltidy -html -pre somefile.pl</p>

<p>Write an html snippet with only the PRE section to
somefile.pl.html. This is useful when code snippets are
being formatted for inclusion in a larger web page. No style
sheet will be written in this case.</p>

<p>perltidy -html -ss &gt;mystyle.css</p>

<p>Write a style sheet to mystyle.css and exit.</p>

<p>perltidy -html -frm mymodule.pm</p>

<p>Write html with a frame holding a table of contents and
the source code. The output files will be mymodule.pm.html
(the frame), mymodule.pm.toc.html (the table of contents),
and mymodule.pm.src.html (the source code).</p>

<p>OPTIONS - OVERVIEW The entire command line is scanned
for options, and they are processed before any files are
processed. As a result, it does not matter whether flags are
before or after any filenames. However, the relative order
of parameters is important, with later parameters overriding
the values of earlier parameters.</p>

<p>For each parameter, there is a long name and a short
name. The short names are convenient for keyboard input,
while the long names are self- documenting and therefore
useful in scripts. It is customary to use two leading dashes
for long names, but one may be used.</p>

<p>Most parameters which serve as on/off flags can be
negated with a leading &quot;n&quot; (for the short name) or
a leading &quot;no&quot; or &quot;no-&quot; (for the long
name). For example, the flag to outdent long quotes is is
-olq or --outdent-long-quotes. The flag to skip this is
-nolq or --nooutdent-long-quotes or
--no-outdent-long-quotes.</p>

<p>Options may not be bundled together. In other words,
options -q and -g may NOT be entered as -qg.</p>

<p>Option names may be terminated early as long as they are
uniquely identified. For example, instead of
--dump-token-types, it would be sufficient to enter
--dump-tok, or even --dump-t, to uniquely identify this
command.</p>

<p>I/O control The following parameters concern the files
which are read and written.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show summary of usage and exit.</p>

<p>-o=filename, --outfile=filename Name of the output file
(only if a single input file is being processed). If no
output file is specified, and output is not redirected to
the standard output, the output will go to filename.tdy.</p>

<p>-st, --standard-output Perltidy must be able to operate
on an arbitrarily large number of files in a single run,
with each output being directed to a different output file.
Obviously this would conflict with outputting to the single
standard output device, so a special flag, -st, is required
to request outputting to the standard output. For
example,</p>

<p>perltidy somefile.pl -st &gt;somefile.new.pl</p>

<p>This option may only be used if there is just a single
input file. The default is -nst or --nostandard-output.</p>

<p>-se, --standard-error-output If perltidy detects an
error when processing file somefile.pl, its default behavior
is to write error messages to file somefile.pl.ERR. Use -se
to cause all error messages to be sent to the standard error
output stream instead. This directive may be negated with
-nse. Thus, you may place -se in a .perltidyrc and override
it when desired with -nse on the command line.</p>

<p>-oext=ext, --output-file-extension=ext Change the
extension of the output file to be ext instead of the
default tdy (or html in case the --html option is used). See
&quot;Specifying File Extensions&quot;.</p>

<p>-opath=path, --output-path=path When perltidy creates a
filename for an output file, by default it merely appends an
extension to the path and basename of the input file. This
parameter causes the path to be changed to path instead.</p>

<p>The path should end in a valid path separator character,
but perltidy will try to add one if it is missing.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<p>perltidy somefile.pl -opath=/tmp/</p>

<p>will produce /tmp/somefile.pl.tdy. Otherwise,
somefile.pl.tdy will appear in whatever directory contains
somefile.pl.</p>

<p>If the path contains spaces, it should be placed in
quotes.</p>

<p>This parameter will be ignored if output is being
directed to standard output, or if it is being specified
explicitly with the -o=s parameter.</p>

<p>-b, --backup-and-modify-in-place Modify the input file
or files in-place and save the original with the extension
.bak. Any existing .bak file will be deleted. See next item
for changing the default backup extension.</p>

<p>A -b flag will be ignored if input is from standard
input, or if the -html flag is set.</p>

<p>-bext=ext, --backup-file-extension=ext Change the
extension of the backup file to be something other than the
default .bak. See &quot;Specifying File
Extensions&quot;.</p>

<p>-w, --warning-output Setting -w causes any non-critical
warning messages to be reported as errors. These include
messages about possible pod problems, possibly bad starting
indentation level, and cautions about indirect object usage.
The default, -nw or --nowarning-output, is not to include
these warnings.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Deactivate error messages and syntax
checking (for running under an editor).</p>

<p>For example, if you use a vi-style editor, such as vim,
you may execute perltidy as a filter from within the editor
using something like</p>

<p>:n1,n2!perltidy -q</p>

<p>where &quot;n1,n2&quot; represents the selected text.
Without the -q flag, any error message may mess up your
screen, so be prepared to use your &quot;undo&quot; key.</p>

<p>-log, --logfile Save the .LOG file, which has many
useful diagnostics. Perltidy always creates a .LOG file, but
by default it is deleted unless a program bug is suspected.
Setting the -log flag forces the log file to be saved.</p>

<p>-g=n, --logfile-gap=n Set maximum interval between input
code lines in the logfile. This purpose of this flag is to
assist in debugging nesting errors. The value of
&quot;n&quot; is optional. If you set the flag -g without
the value of &quot;n&quot;, it will be taken to be 1,
meaning that every line will be written to the log file.
This can be helpful if you are looking for a brace, paren,
or bracket nesting error.</p>

<p>Setting -g also causes the logfile to be saved, so it is
not necessary to also include -log.</p>

<p>If no -g flag is given, a value of 50 will be used,
meaning that at least every 50th line will be recorded in
the logfile. This helps prevent excessively long log
files.</p>

<p>Setting a negative value of &quot;n&quot; is the same as
not setting -g at all.</p>

<p>-npro --noprofile Ignore any .perltidyrc command file.
Normally, perltidy looks first in your current directory for
a .perltidyrc file of parameters. (The format is described
below). If it finds one, it applies those options to the
initial default values, and then it applies any that have
been defined on the command line. If no .perltidyrc file is
found, it looks for one in your home directory.</p>

<p>If you set the -npro flag, perltidy will not look for
this file.</p>

<p>-pro=filename or --profile=filename To simplify testing
and switching .perltidyrc files, this command may be used to
specify a configuration file which will override the default
name of .perltidyrc. There must not be a space on either
side of the = sign. For example, the line</p>

<p>perltidy -pro=testcfg</p>

<p>would cause file testcfg to be used instead of the
default .perltidyrc.</p>

<p>-opt, --show-options Write a list of all options used to
the .LOG file. Please see --dump-options for a simpler way
to do this.</p>

<p>-f, --force-read-binary Force perltidy to process binary
files. To avoid producing excessive error messages, perltidy
skips files identified by the system as non-text. However,
valid perl scripts containing binary data may sometimes be
identified as non-text, and this flag forces perltidy to
process them.</p>

<p>FORMATTING OPTIONS Basic Options -l=n,
--maximum-line-length=n The default maximum line length is
n=80 characters. Perltidy will try to find line break points
to keep lines below this length. However, long quotes and
side comments may cause lines to exceed this length. Setting
-l=0 is equivalent to setting -l=(a large number).</p>

<p>-i=n, --indent-columns=n Use n columns per indentation
level (default n=4).</p>

<p>tabs Using tab characters will almost certainly lead to
future portability and maintenance problems, so the default
and recommendation is not to use them. For those who prefer
tabs, however, there are two different options.</p>

<p>Except for possibly introducing tab indentation
characters, as outlined below, perltidy does not introduce
any tab characters into your file, and it removes any tabs
from the code (unless requested not to do so with -fws). If
you have any tabs in your comments, quotes, or
here-documents, they will remain.</p>

<p>-et=n, --entab-leading-whitespace This flag causes each
n initial space characters to be replaced by one tab
character. Note that the integer n is completely independent
of the integer specified for indentation parameter,
-i=n.</p>

<p>-t, --tabs This flag causes one leading tab character to
be inserted for each level of indentation. Certain other
features are incompatible with this option, and if these
options are also given, then a warning message will be
issued and this flag will be unset. One example is the -lp
option.</p>

<p>-syn, --check-syntax This flag causes perltidy to run
&quot;perl -c -T&quot; to check syntax of input and output.
(To change the flags passed to perl, see the next item,
-pscf). The results are written to the .LOG file, which will
be saved if an error is detected in the output script. The
output script is not checked if the input script has a
syntax error. Perltidy does its own checking, but this
option employs perl to get a &quot;second opinion&quot;.</p>

<p>If perl reports errors in the input file, they will not
be reported in the error output unless the --warning-output
flag is given.</p>

<p>The default is not to do this type of syntax checking
(although perltidy will still do as much self-checking as
possible). The reason is that it causes all code in BEGIN
blocks to be executed, for all modules being used, and this
opens the door to security issues and infinite loops when
running perltidy.</p>

<p>-pscf=s, -perl-syntax-check-flags=s When perl is invoked
to check syntax, the normal flags are &quot;-c -T&quot;. In
addition, if the -x flag is given to perltidy, then perl
will also be passed a -x flag. It should not normally be
necessary to change these flags, but it can be done with the
-pscf=s flag. For example, if the taint flag,
&quot;-T&quot;, is not wanted, the flag could be set to be
just -pscf=-c.</p>

<p>Perltidy will pass your string to perl with the
exception that it will add a -c and -x if appropriate. The
.LOG file will show exactly what flags were passed to
perl.</p>

<p>-io, --indent-only This flag is used to deactivate all
formatting and line break changes within non-blank lines of
code. When it is in effect, the only change to the script
will be to the indentation and blank lines. And any flags
controlling whitespace and newlines will be ignored. You
might want to use this if you are perfectly happy with your
whitespace and line breaks, and merely want perltidy to
handle the indentation. (This also speeds up perltidy by
well over a factor of two, so it might be useful when
perltidy is merely being used to help find a brace error in
a large script).</p>

<p>Setting this flag is equivalent to setting
--freeze-newlines and --freeze-whitespace.</p>

<p>If you also want to keep your existing blank lines
exactly as they are, you can add --freeze-blank-lines.</p>

<p>-ole=s, --output-line-ending=s where s=&quot;win&quot;,
&quot;dos&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;, or &quot;mac&quot;. This
flag tells perltidy to output line endings for a specific
system. Normally, perltidy writes files with the line
separator character of the host system. The &quot;win&quot;
and &quot;dos&quot; flags have an identical result.</p>

<p>-ple, --preserve-line-endings This flag tells perltidy
to write its output files with the same line endings as the
input file, if possible. It should work for dos, unix, and
mac line endings. It will only work if perltidy input comes
from a filename (rather than stdin, for example). If
perltidy has trouble determining the input file line ending,
it will revert to the default behavior of using the line
ending of the host system.</p>

<p>Code Indentation Control -ci=n,
--continuation-indentation=n Continuation indentation is
extra indentation spaces applied when a long line is broken.
The default is n=2, illustrated here:</p>

<p>my $level = # -ci=2 ( $max_index_to_go &gt;= 0 ) ?
$levels_to_go[0] : $last_output_level;</p>

<p>The same example, with n=0, is a little harder to
read:</p>

<p>my $level = # -ci=0 ( $max_index_to_go &gt;= 0 ) ?
$levels_to_go[0] : $last_output_level;</p>

<p>The value given to -ci is also used by some commands
when a small space is required. Examples are commands for
outdenting labels, -ola, and control keywords, -okw.</p>

<p>When default values are not used, it is suggested that
the value n given with -ci=n be no more than about one-half
of the number of spaces assigned to a full indentation level
on the -i=n command.</p>

<p>-sil=n --starting-indentation-level=n By default,
perltidy examines the input file and tries to determine the
starting indentation level. While it is often zero, it may
not be zero for a code snippet being sent from an editing
session. If the default method does not work correctly, or
you want to change the starting level, use -sil=n, to force
the starting level to be n.</p>

<p>List indentation using -lp, --line-up-parentheses By
default, perltidy indents lists with 4 spaces, or whatever
value is specified with -i=n. Here is a small list formatted
in this way:</p>

<p># perltidy (default) @month_of_year = (
&rsquo;Jan&rsquo;, &rsquo;Feb&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mar&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Apr&rsquo;, &rsquo;May&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jun&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Jul&rsquo;, &rsquo;Aug&rsquo;, &rsquo;Sep&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Oct&rsquo;, &rsquo;Nov&rsquo;, &rsquo;Dec&rsquo;
);</p>

<p>Use the -lp flag to add extra indentation to cause the
data to begin past the opening parentheses of a sub call or
list, or opening square bracket of an anonymous array, or
opening curly brace of an anonymous hash. With this option,
the above list would become:</p>

<p># perltidy -lp @month_of_year = ( &rsquo;Jan&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Feb&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mar&rsquo;, &rsquo;Apr&rsquo;,
&rsquo;May&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jun&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jul&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Aug&rsquo;, &rsquo;Sep&rsquo;, &rsquo;Oct&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Nov&rsquo;, &rsquo;Dec&rsquo; );</p>

<p>If the available line length (see -l=n ) does not permit
this much space, perltidy will use less. For alternate
placement of the closing paren, see the next section.</p>

<p>This option has no effect on code BLOCKS, such as
if/then/else blocks, which always use whatever is specified
with -i=n. Also, the existence of line breaks and/or block
comments between the opening and closing parens may cause
perltidy to temporarily revert to its default method.</p>

<p>Note: The -lp option may not be used together with the
-t tabs option. It may, however, be used with the -et=n tab
method.</p>

<p>In addition, any parameter which significantly restricts
the ability of perltidy to choose newlines will conflict
with -lp and will cause -lp to be deactivated. These include
-io, -fnl, -nanl, and -ndnl. The reason is that the -lp
indentation style can require the careful coordination of an
arbitrary number of break points in hierarchical lists, and
these flags may prevent that.</p>

<p>-cti=n, --closing-token-indentation The -cti=n flag
controls the indentation of a line beginning with a
&quot;)&quot;, &quot;]&quot;, or a non-block &quot;}&quot;.
Such a line receives:</p>

<p>-cti = 0 no extra indentation (default) -cti = 1 extra
indentation such that the closing token aligns with its
opening token. -cti = 2 one extra indentation level if the
line looks like: ); or ]; or }; -cti = 3 one extra
indentation level always</p>

<p>The flags -cti=1 and -cti=2 work well with the -lp flag
(previous section).</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -cti=1 @month_of_year = (
&rsquo;Jan&rsquo;, &rsquo;Feb&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mar&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Apr&rsquo;, &rsquo;May&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jun&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Jul&rsquo;, &rsquo;Aug&rsquo;, &rsquo;Sep&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Oct&rsquo;, &rsquo;Nov&rsquo;, &rsquo;Dec&rsquo;
);</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -cti=2 @month_of_year = (
&rsquo;Jan&rsquo;, &rsquo;Feb&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mar&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Apr&rsquo;, &rsquo;May&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jun&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Jul&rsquo;, &rsquo;Aug&rsquo;, &rsquo;Sep&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Oct&rsquo;, &rsquo;Nov&rsquo;, &rsquo;Dec&rsquo;
);</p>

<p>These flags are merely hints to the formatter and they
may not always be followed. In particular, if -lp is not
being used, the indentation for cti=1 is constrained to be
no more than one indentation level.</p>

<p>If desired, this control can be applied independently to
each of the closing container token types. In fact, -cti=n
is merely an abbreviation for -cpi=n -csbi=n -cbi=n, where:
-cpi or --closing-paren-indentation controls )s, -csbi or
--closing-square-bracket-indentation controls ]s, -cbi or
--closing-brace-indentation controls non-block }s.</p>

<p>-icp, --indent-closing-paren The -icp flag is equivalent
to -cti=2, described in the previous section. The -nicp flag
is equivalent -cti=0. They are included for backwards
compatability.</p>

<p>-icb, --indent-closing-brace The -icb option gives one
extra level of indentation to a brace which terminates a
code block . For example,</p>

<p>if ($task) { yyy(); } # -icb else { zzz(); }</p>

<p>The default is not to do this, indicated by -nicb.</p>

<p>-olq, --outdent-long-quotes When -olq is set, lines
which is a quoted string longer than the value
maximum-line-length will have their indentation removed to
make them more readable. This is the default. To prevent
such out-denting, use -nolq or --nooutdent-long-lines.</p>

<p>-oll, --outdent-long-lines This command is equivalent to
--outdent-long-quotes and --outdent-long-comments, and it is
included for compatibility with previous versions of
perltidy. The negation of this also works, -noll or
--nooutdent-long-lines, and is equivalent to setting -nolq
and -nolc.</p>

<p>Outdenting Labels: -ola, --outdent-labels This command
will cause labels to be outdented by 2 spaces (or whatever
-ci has been set to), if possible. This is the default. For
example:</p>

<p>my $i; LOOP: while ( $i = &lt;FOTOS&gt; ) { chomp($i);
next unless $i; fixit($i); }</p>

<p>Use -nola to not outdent labels.</p>

<p>Outdenting Keywords -okw, --outdent-keywords The command
-okw will will cause certain leading control keywords to be
outdented by 2 spaces (or whatever -ci has been set to), if
possible. By default, these keywords are &quot;redo&quot;,
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;goto&quot;, and
&quot;return&quot;. The intention is to make these control
keywords easier to see. To change this list of keywords
being outdented, see the next section.</p>

<p>For example, using &quot;perltidy -okw&quot; on the
previous example gives:</p>

<p>my $i; LOOP: while ( $i = &lt;FOTOS&gt; ) { chomp($i);
next unless $i; fixit($i); }</p>

<p>The default is not to do this.</p>

<p>Specifying Outdented Keywords: -okwl=string,
--outdent-keyword-list=string This command can be used to
change the keywords which are outdented with the -okw
command. The parameter string is a required list of perl
keywords, which should be placed in quotes if there are more
than one. By itself, it does not cause any outdenting to
occur, so the -okw command is still required.</p>

<p>For example, the commands &quot;-okwl=&quot;next last
redo goto&quot; -okw&quot; will cause those four keywords to
be outdented. It is probably simplest to place any -okwl
command in a .perltidyrc file.</p>

<p>Whitespace Control Whitespace refers to the blank space
between variables, operators, and other code tokens.</p>

<p>-fws, --freeze-whitespace This flag causes your original
whitespace to remain unchanged, and causes the rest of the
whitespace commands in this section, the Code Indentation
section, and the Comment Control section to be ignored.</p>

<p>Tightness of curly braces, parentheses, and square
brackets. Here the term &quot;tightness&quot; will mean the
closeness with which pairs of enclosing tokens, such as
parentheses, contain the quantities within. A numerical
value of 0, 1, or 2 defines the tightness, with 0 being
least tight and 2 being most tight. Spaces within containers
are always symmetric, so if there is a space after a
&quot;(&quot; then there will be a space before the
corresponding &quot;)&quot;.</p>

<p>The -pt=n or --paren-tightness=n parameter controls the
space within parens. The example below shows the effect of
the three possible values, 0, 1, and 2:</p>

<p>if ( ( my $len_tab = length( $tabstr ) ) &gt; 0 ) { #
-pt=0 if ( ( my $len_tab = length($tabstr) ) &gt; 0 ) { #
-pt=1 (default) if ((my $len_tab = length($tabstr)) &gt; 0)
{ # -pt=2</p>

<p>When n is 0, there is always a space to the right of a (
and to the left of a ). For n=2 there is never a space. For
n=1, the default, there is a space unless the quantity
within the parens is a single token, such as an identifier
or quoted string.</p>

<p>Likewise, the parameter -sbt=n or
--square-bracket-tightness=n controls the space within
square brackets, as illustrated below.</p>

<p>$width = $col[ $j + $k ] - $col[ $j ]; # -sbt=0 $width =
$col[ $j + $k ] - $col[$j]; # -sbt=1 (default) $width =
$col[$j + $k] - $col[$j]; # -sbt=2</p>

<p>Curly braces which do not contain code blocks are
controlled by the parameter -bt=n or
--brace-tightness=n.</p>

<p>$obj-&gt;{ $parsed_sql-&gt;{ &rsquo;table&rsquo; }[0] };
# -bt=0 $obj-&gt;{ $parsed_sql-&gt;{&rsquo;table&rsquo;}[0]
}; # -bt=1 (default)
$obj-&gt;{$parsed_sql-&gt;{&rsquo;table&rsquo;}[0]}; #
-bt=2</p>

<p>And finally, curly braces which contain blocks of code
are controlled by the parameter -bbt=n or
--block-brace-tightness=n as illustrated in the example
below.</p>

<p>%bf = map { $_ =&gt; -M $_ } grep { /.deb$/ } dirents
&rsquo;.&rsquo;; # -bbt=0 (default) %bf = map { $_ =&gt; -M
$_ } grep {/.deb$/} dirents &rsquo;.&rsquo;; # -bbt=1 %bf =
map {$_ =&gt; -M $_} grep {/.deb$/} dirents &rsquo;.&rsquo;;
# -bbt=2</p>

<p>-sts, --space-terminal-semicolon Some programmers prefer
a space before all terminal semicolons. The default is for
no such space, and is indicated with -nsts or
--nospace-terminal-semicolon.</p>

<p>$i = 1 ; # -sts $i = 1; # -nsts (default)</p>

<p>-sfs, --space-for-semicolon Semicolons within for loops
may sometimes be hard to see, particularly when commas are
also present. This option places spaces on both sides of
these special semicolons, and is the default. Use -nsfs or
--nospace-for-semicolon to deactivate it.</p>

<p>for ( @a = @$ap, $u = shift @a ; @a ; $u = $v ) { # -sfs
(default) for ( @a = @$ap, $u = shift @a; @a; $u = $v ) { #
-nsfs</p>

<p>-asc, --add-semicolons Setting -asc allows perltidy to
add any missing optional semicolon at the end of a line
which is followed by a closing curly brace on the next line.
This is the default, and may be deactivated with -nasc or
--noadd-semicolons.</p>

<p>-dsm, --delete-semicolons Setting -dsm allows perltidy
to delete extra semicolons which are simply empty
statements. This is the default, and may be deactivated with
-ndsm or --nodelete-semicolons. (Such semicolons are not
deleted, however, if they would promote a side comment to a
block comment).</p>

<p>-aws, --add-whitespace Setting this option allows
perltidy to add certain whitespace improve code readability.
This is the default. If you do not want any whitespace
added, but are willing to have some whitespace deleted, use
-naws. (Use -fws to leave whitespace completely
unchanged).</p>

<p>-dws, --delete-old-whitespace Setting this option allows
perltidy to remove some old whitespace between characters,
if necessary. This is the default. If you do not want any
old whitespace removed, use -ndws or
--nodelete-old-whitespace.</p>

<p>Detailed whitespace controls around tokens For those who
want more detailed control over the whitespace around
tokens, there are four parameters which can directly modify
the default whitespace rules built into perltidy for any
token. They are:</p>

<p>-wls=s or --want-left-space=s,</p>

<p>-nwls=s or --nowant-left-space=s,</p>

<p>-wrs=s or --want-right-space=s,</p>

<p>-nwrs=s or --nowant-right-space=s.</p>

<p>These parameters are each followed by a quoted string,
s, containing a list of token types. No more than one of
each of these parameters should be specified, because
repeating a command- line parameter always overwrites the
previous one before perltidy ever sees it.</p>

<p>To illustrate how these are used, suppose it is desired
that there be no space on either side of the token types = +
- / *. The following two parameters would specify this
desire:</p>

<p>-nwls=&quot;= + - / *&quot; -nwrs=&quot;= + - /
*&quot;</p>

<p>(Note that the token types are in quotes, and that they
are separated by spaces). With these modified whitespace
rules, the following line of math:</p>

<p>$root = -$b + sqrt( $b * $b - 4. * $a * $c ) / ( 2. * $a
);</p>

<p>becomes this:</p>

<p>$root=-$b+sqrt( $b*$b-4.*$a*$c )/( 2.*$a );</p>

<p>These parameters should be considered to be hints to
perltidy rather than fixed rules, because perltidy must try
to resolve conflicts that arise between them and all of the
other rules that it uses. One conflict that can arise is if,
between two tokens, the left token wants a space and the
right one doesnt. In this case, the token not wanting a
space takes priority.</p>

<p>It is necessary to have a list of all token types in
order to create this type of input. Such a list can be
obtained by the command --dump-token-types. Also try the -D
flag on a short snippet of code and look at the .DEBUG file
to see the tokenization.</p>

<p>WARNING Be sure to put these tokens in quotes to avoid
having them misinterpreted by your command shell.</p>

<p>Space between specific keywords and opening paren When
an opening paren follows a Perl keyword, no space is
introduced after the keyword, unless it is (by default) one
of these:</p>

<p>my local our and or eq ne if else elsif until unless
while for foreach return switch case given when</p>

<p>These defaults can be modified with two commands:</p>

<p>-sak=s or --space-after-keyword=s adds keywords.</p>

<p>-nsak=s or --nospace-after-keyword=s removes
keywords.</p>

<p>where s is a list of keywords (in quotes if necessary).
For example,</p>

<p>my ( $a, $b, $c ) = @_; # default my( $a, $b, $c ) = @_;
# -nsak=&quot;my local our&quot;</p>

<p>To put a space after all keywords, see the next
item.</p>

<p>Space between all keywords and opening parens When an
opening paren follows a function or keyword, no space is
introduced after the keyword except for the keywords noted
in the previous item. To always put a space between a
function or keyword and its opening paren, use the
command:</p>

<p>-skp or --space-keyword-paren</p>

<p>You will probably also want to use the flag -sfp (next
item) too.</p>

<p>Space between all function names and opening parens When
an opening paren follows a function the default is not to
introduce a space. To cause a space to be introduced
use:</p>

<p>-sfp or --space-function-paren</p>

<p>myfunc( $a, $b, $c ); # default myfunc ( $a, $b, $c ); #
-sfp</p>

<p>You will probably also want to use the flag -skp
(previous item) too.</p>

<p>Trimming whitespace around &quot;qw&quot; quotes -tqw or
--trim-qw provide the default behavior of trimming spaces
around multi-line &quot;qw&quot; quotes and indenting them
appropriately.</p>

<p>-ntqw or --notrim-qw cause leading and trailing
whitespace around multi-line &quot;qw&quot; quotes to be
left unchanged. This option will not normally be necessary,
but was added for testing purposes, because in some versions
of perl, trimming &quot;qw&quot; quotes changes the syntax
tree.</p>

<p>Comment Controls Perltidy has a number of ways to
control the appearance of both block comments and side
comments. The term block comment here refers to a full-line
comment, whereas side comment will refer to a comment which
appears on a line to the right of some code.</p>

<p>-ibc, --indent-block-comments Block comments normally
look best when they are indented to the same level as the
code which follows them. This is the default behavior, but
you may use -nibc to keep block comments left- justified.
Here is an example:</p>

<p># this comment is indented (-ibc, default) if ($task) {
yyy(); }</p>

<p>The alternative is -nibc:</p>

<p># this comment is not indented (-nibc) if ($task) {
yyy(); }</p>

<p>See also the next item, -isbc, as well as -sbc, for
other ways to have some indented and some outdented block
comments.</p>

<p>-isbc, --indent-spaced-block-comments If there is no
leading space on the line, then the comment will not be
indented, and otherwise it may be.</p>

<p>If both -ibc and -isbc are set, then -isbc takes
priority.</p>

<p>-olc, --outdent-long-comments When -olc is set, lines
which are full-line (block) comments longer than the value
maximum-line-length will have their indentation removed.
This is the default; use -nolc to prevent outdenting.</p>

<p>-msc=n, --minimum-space-to-comment=n Side comments look
best when lined up several spaces to the right of code.
Perltidy will try to keep comments at least n spaces to the
right. The default is n=4 spaces.</p>

<p>-fpsc=n, --fixed-position-side-comment=n This parameter
tells perltidy to line up side comments in column number n
whenever possible. The default, n=0, is not do do this.</p>

<p>-hsc, --hanging-side-comments By default, perltidy tries
to identify and align &quot;hanging side comments&quot;,
which are something like this:</p>

<p>my $IGNORE = 0; # This is a side comment # This is a
hanging side comment # And so is this</p>

<p>A comment is considered to be a hanging side comment if
(1) it immediately follows a line with a side comment, or
another hanging side comment, and (2) there is some leading
whitespace on the line. To deactivate this feature, use
-nhsc or --nohanging-side-comments. If block comments are
preceded by a blank line, or have no leading whitespace,
they will not be mistaken as hanging side comments.</p>

<p>Closing Side Comments A closing side comment is a
special comment which perltidy can automatically create and
place after the closing brace of a code block. They can be
useful for code maintenance and debugging. The command -csc
(or --closing-side-comments) adds or updates closing side
comments. For example, here is a small code snippet</p>

<p>sub message { if ( !defined( $_[0] ) ) {
print(&quot;Hello, World0); } else { print( $_[0], &quot;0
); } }</p>

<p>And here is the result of processing with &quot;perltidy
-csc&quot;:</p>

<p>sub message { if ( !defined( $_[0] ) ) {
print(&quot;Hello, World0); } else { print( $_[0], &quot;0
); } } ## end sub message</p>

<p>A closing side comment was added for &quot;sub
message&quot; in this case, but not for the &quot;if&quot;
and &quot;else&quot; blocks, because they were below the 6
line cutoff limit for adding closing side comments. This
limit may be changed with the -csci command, described
below.</p>

<p>The command -dcsc (or --delete-closing-side-comments)
reverses this process and removes these comments.</p>

<p>Several commands are available to modify the behavior of
these two basic commands, -csc and -dcsc:</p>

<p>-csci=n, or --closing-side-comment-interval=n where
&quot;n&quot; is the minimum number of lines that a block
must have in order for a closing side comment to be added.
The default value is &quot;n=6&quot;. To illustrate:</p>

<p># perltidy -csci=2 -csc sub message { if ( !defined(
$_[0] ) ) { print(&quot;Hello, World0); } ## end if (
!defined( $_[0] )) else { print( $_[0], &quot;0 ); } ## end
else [ if ( !defined( $_[0] )) } ## end sub message</p>

<p>Now the &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; blocks are
commented. However, now this has become very cluttered.</p>

<p>-cscp=string, or --closing-side-comment-prefix=string
where string is the prefix used before the name of the block
type. The default prefix, shown above, is &quot;##
end&quot;. This string will be added to closing side
comments, and it will also be used to recognize them in
order to update, delete, and format them. Any comment
identified as a closing side comment will be placed just a
single space to the right of its closing brace.</p>

<p>-cscl=string, or --closing-side-comment-list-string
where &quot;string&quot; is a list of block types to be
tagged with closing side comments. By default, all code
block types preceded by a keyword or label (such as
&quot;if&quot;, &quot;sub&quot;, and so on) will be tagged.
The -cscl command changes the default list to be any
selected block types; see &quot;Specifying Block
Types&quot;. For example, the following command requests
that only &quot;sub&quot;s, labels, &quot;BEGIN&quot;, and
&quot;END&quot; blocks be affected by any -csc or -dcsc
operation:</p>

<p>-cscl=&quot;sub : BEGIN END&quot;</p>

<p>-csct=n, or --closing-side-comment-maximum-text=n The
text appended to certain block types, such as an
&quot;if&quot; block, is whatever lies between the keyword
introducing the block, such as &quot;if&quot;, and the
opening brace. Since this might be too much text for a side
comment, there needs to be a limit, and that is the purpose
of this parameter. The default value is &quot;n=20&quot;,
meaning that no additional tokens will be appended to this
text after its length reaches 20 characters. Omitted text is
indicated with &quot;...&quot;. (Tokens, including sub
names, are never truncated, however, so actual lengths may
exceed this). To illustrate, in the above example, the
appended text of the first block is &quot; ( !defined( $_[0]
)...&quot;. The existing limit of &quot;n=20&quot; caused
this text to be truncated, as indicated by the
&quot;...&quot;. See the next flag for additional control of
the abbreviated text.</p>

<p>-cscb, or --closing-side-comments-balanced As discussed
in the previous item, when the closing-side-
comment-maximum-text limit is exceeded the comment text must
be truncated. Older versions of perltidy terminated with
three dots, and this can still be achieved with -ncscb:</p>

<p>perltidy -csc -ncscb } ## end foreach my $foo (sort { $b
cmp $a ...</p>

<p>However this causes a problem with editors editors which
cannot recognize comments or are not configured to do so
because they cannot &quot;bounce&quot; around in the text
correctly. The -cscb flag has been added to help them by
appending appropriate balancing structure:</p>

<p>perltidy -csc -cscb } ## end foreach my $foo (sort { $b
cmp $a ... })</p>

<p>The default is -cscb.</p>

<p>-csce=n, or --closing-side-comment-else-flag=n The
default, n=0, places the text of the opening &quot;if&quot;
statement after any terminal &quot;else&quot;.</p>

<p>If n=2 is used, then each &quot;elsif&quot; is also
given the text of the opening &quot;if&quot; statement.
Also, an &quot;else&quot; will include the text of a
preceding &quot;elsif&quot; statement. Note that this may
result some long closing side comments.</p>

<p>If n=1 is used, the results will be the same as n=2
whenever the resulting line length is less than the maximum
allowed. =item -cscb, or
--closing-side-comments-balanced</p>

<p>When using closing-side-comments, and the
closing-side-comment- maximum-text limit is exceeded, then
the comment text must be abbreviated. It is terminated with
three dots if the -cscb flag is negated:</p>

<p>perltidy -csc -ncscb } ## end foreach my $foo (sort { $b
cmp $a ...</p>

<p>This causes a problem with older editors which do not
recognize comments because they cannot &quot;bounce&quot;
around in the text correctly. The -cscb flag tries to help
them by appending appropriate terminal balancing
structures:</p>

<p>perltidy -csc -cscb } ## end foreach my $foo (sort { $b
cmp $a ... })</p>

<p>The default is -cscb.</p>

<p>-cscw, or --closing-side-comment-warnings This parameter
is intended to help make the initial transition to the use
of closing side comments. It causes two things to happen if
a closing side comment replaces an existing, different
closing side comment: first, an error message will be
issued, and second, the original side comment will be placed
alone on a new specially marked comment line for later
attention.</p>

<p>The intent is to avoid clobbering existing hand-written
side comments which happen to match the pattern of closing
side comments. This flag should only be needed on the first
run with -csc.</p>

<p>Important Notes on Closing Side Comments:</p>

<p>&middot; Closing side comments are only placed on lines
terminated with a closing brace. Certain closing styles,
such as the use of cuddled elses (-ce), preclude the
generation of some closing side comments.</p>

<p>&middot; Please note that adding or deleting of closing
side comments takes place only through the commands -csc or
-dcsc. The other commands, if used, merely modify the
behavior of these two commands.</p>

<p>&middot; It is recommended that the -cscw flag be used
along with -csc on the first use of perltidy on a given
file. This will prevent loss of any existing side comment
data which happens to have the csc prefix.</p>

<p>&middot; Once you use -csc, you should continue to use
it so that any closing side comments remain correct as code
changes. Otherwise, these comments will become incorrect as
the code is updated.</p>

<p>&middot; If you edit the closing side comments generated
by perltidy, you must also change the prefix to be different
from the closing side comment prefix. Otherwise, your edits
will be lost when you rerun perltidy with -csc. For example,
you could simply change &quot;## end&quot; to be &quot;##
End&quot;, since the test is case sensitive. You may also
want to use the -ssc flag to keep these modified closing
side comments spaced the same as actual closing side
comments.</p>

<p>&middot; Temporarily generating closing side comments is
a useful technique for exploring and/or debugging a perl
script, especially one written by someone else. You can
always remove them with -dcsc.</p>

<p>Static Block Comments Static block comments are block
comments with a special leading pattern, &quot;##&quot; by
default, which will be treated slightly differently from
other block comments. They effectively behave as if they had
glue along their left and top edges, because they stick to
the left edge and previous line when there is no blank
spaces in those places. This option is particularly useful
for controlling how commented code is displayed.</p>

<p>-sbc, --static-block-comments When -sbc is used, a block
comment with a special leading pattern, &quot;##&quot; by
default, will be treated specially.</p>

<p>Comments so identified are treated as follows:</p>

<p>&middot; If there is no leading space on the line, then
the comment will not be indented, and otherwise it may
be,</p>

<p>&middot; no new blank line will be inserted before such
a comment, and</p>

<p>&middot; such a comment will never become a hanging side
comment.</p>

<p>For example, assuming @month_of_year is
left-adjusted:</p>

<p>@month_of_year = ( # -sbc (default) &rsquo;Jan&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Feb&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mar&rsquo;, &rsquo;Apr&rsquo;,
&rsquo;May&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jun&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jul&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Aug&rsquo;, &rsquo;Sep&rsquo;, &rsquo;Oct&rsquo;, ##
&rsquo;Dec&rsquo;, &rsquo;Nov&rsquo; &rsquo;Nov&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Dec&rsquo;);</p>

<p>Without this convention, the above code would become</p>

<p>@month_of_year = ( # -nsbc &rsquo;Jan&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Feb&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mar&rsquo;, &rsquo;Apr&rsquo;,
&rsquo;May&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jun&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jul&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Aug&rsquo;, &rsquo;Sep&rsquo;, &rsquo;Oct&rsquo;,</p>

<p>## &rsquo;Dec&rsquo;, &rsquo;Nov&rsquo;
&rsquo;Nov&rsquo;, &rsquo;Dec&rsquo; );</p>

<p>which is not as clear. The default is to use -sbc. This
may be deactivated with -nsbc.</p>

<p>-sbcp=string, --static-block-comment-prefix=string This
parameter defines the prefix used to identify static block
comments when the -sbc parameter is set. The default prefix
is &quot;##&quot;, corresponding to &quot;-sbcp=##&quot;.
The prefix is actually part of a perl pattern used to match
lines and it must either begin with &quot;#&quot; or
&quot;^#&quot;. In the first case a prefix ^ will be added
to match any leading whitespace, while in the second case
the pattern will match only comments with no leading
whitespace. For example, to identify all comments as static
block comments, one would use &quot;-sbcp=#&quot;. To
identify all left- adjusted comments as static block
comments, use &quot;-sbcp=&rsquo;^#&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p>Please note that -sbcp merely defines the pattern used
to identify static block comments; it will not be used
unless the switch -sbc is set. Also, please be aware that
since this string is used in a perl regular expression which
identifies these comments, it must enable a valid regular
expression to be formed.</p>

<p>A pattern which can be useful is:</p>

<p>-sbcp=^#{2,}[^</p>

<p>This pattern requires a static block comment to have at
least one character which is neither a # nor a space. It
allows a line containing only # characters to be rejected as
a static block comment. Such lines are often used at the
start and end of header information in subroutines and
should not be separated from the intervening comments, which
typically begin with just a single #.</p>

<p>-osbc, --outdent-static-block-comments The command -osbc
will will cause static block comments to be outdented by 2
spaces (or whatever -ci=n has been set to), if possible.</p>

<p>Static Side Comments Static side comments are side
comments with a special leading pattern. This option can be
useful for controlling how commented code is displayed when
it is a side comment.</p>

<p>-ssc, --static-side-comments When -ssc is used, a side
comment with a static leading pattern, which is
&quot;##&quot; by default, will be be spaced only a single
space from previous character, and it will not be vertically
aligned with other side comments.</p>

<p>The default is -nssc.</p>

<p>-sscp=string, --static-side-comment-prefix=string This
parameter defines the prefix used to identify static side
comments when the -ssc parameter is set. The default prefix
is &quot;##&quot;, corresponding to
&quot;-sscp=##&quot;.</p>

<p>Please note that -sscp merely defines the pattern used
to identify static side comments; it will not be used unless
the switch -ssc is set. Also, note that this string is used
in a perl regular expression which identifies these
comments, so it must enable a valid regular expression to be
formed.</p>

<p>Skipping Selected Sections of Code Selected lines of
code may be passed verbatim to the output without any
formatting. This feature is enabled by default but can be
disabled with the --noformat-skipping or -nfs flag. It
should be used sparingly to avoid littering code with
markers, but it might be helpful for working around
occasional problems. For example it might be useful for
keeping the indentation of old commented code unchanged,
keeping indentation of long blocks of aligned comments
unchanged, keeping certain list formatting unchanged, or
working around a glitch in perltidy.</p>

<p>-fs, --format-skipping This flag, which is enabled by
default, causes any code between special beginning and
ending comment markers to be passed to the output without
formatting. The default beginning marker is #&lt;&lt;&lt;
and the default ending marker is #&gt;&gt;&gt; but they may
be changed (see next items below). Additional text may
appear on these special comment lines provided that it is
separated from the marker by at least one space. For
example</p>

<p>#&lt;&lt;&lt; do not let perltidy touch this my @list =
(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 6, 4, 1,);
#&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>The comment markers may be placed at any location that a
block comment may appear. If they do not appear to be
working, use the -log flag and examine the .LOG file. Use
-nfs to disable this feature.</p>

<p>-fsb=string, --format-skipping-begin=string The
-fsb=string parameter may be used to change the beginning
marker for format skipping. The default is equivalent to
-fsb= #&lt;&lt;&lt;. The string that you enter must begin
with a # and should be in quotes as necessary to get past
the command shell of your system. It is actually the leading
text of a pattern that is constructed by appending a so you
must also include backslashes for characters to be taken
literally rather than as patterns.</p>

<p>Some examples show how example strings become
patterns:</p>

<p>-fsb=&rsquo;#&rsquo; becomes /^# which matches #{{{ but
not #{{{{ -fsb=&rsquo;# becomes /^#/ which matches #** but
not #*** -fsb=&rsquo;#2,}&rsquo; becomes /^#2,} which
matches #** and #*****</p>

<p>-fse=string, --format-skipping-end=string The
-fsb=string is the corresponding parameter used to change
the ending marker for format skipping. The default is
equivalent to -fse=#&lt;&lt;&lt;.</p>

<p>Line Break Control The parameters in this section
control breaks after non-blank lines of code. Blank lines
are controlled separately by parameters in the section
&quot;Blank Line Control&quot;.</p>

<p>-fnl, --freeze-newlines If you do not want any changes
to the line breaks within lines of code in your script, set
-fnl, and they will remain fixed, and the rest of the
commands in this section and sections &quot;Controlling List
Formatting&quot;, &quot;Retaining or Ignoring Existing Line
Breaks&quot;. You may want to use -noll with this.</p>

<p>Note: If you also want to keep your blank lines exactly
as they are, you can use the -fbl flag which is described in
the section &quot;Blank Line Control&quot;.</p>

<p>-ce, --cuddled-else Enable the &quot;cuddled else&quot;
style, in which &quot;else&quot; and &quot;elsif&quot; are
follow immediately after the curly brace closing the
previous block. The default is not to use cuddled elses, and
is indicated with the flag -nce or --nocuddled-else. Here is
a comparison of the alternatives:</p>

<p>if ($task) { yyy(); } else { # -ce zzz(); }</p>

<p>if ($task) { yyy(); } else { # -nce (default) zzz();
}</p>

<p>-bl, --opening-brace-on-new-line Use the flag -bl to
place the opening brace on a new line:</p>

<p>if ( $input_file eq &rsquo;-&rsquo; ) # -bl {
important_function(); }</p>

<p>This flag applies to all structural blocks, including
named subs (unless the -sbl flag is set -- see next
item).</p>

<p>The default style, -nbl, places an opening brace on the
same line as the keyword introducing it. For example,</p>

<p>if ( $input_file eq &rsquo;-&rsquo; ) { # -nbl
(default)</p>

<p>-sbl, --opening-sub-brace-on-new-line The flag -sbl can
be used to override the value of -bl for the opening braces
of named subs. For example,</p>

<p>perltidy -sbl</p>

<p>produces this result:</p>

<p>sub message { if (!defined($_[0])) { print(&quot;Hello,
World0); } else { print($_[0], &quot;0); } }</p>

<p>This flag is negated with -nsbl. If -sbl is not
specified, the value of -bl is used.</p>

<p>-asbl, --opening-anonymous-sub-brace-on-new-line The
flag -asbl is like the -sbl flag except that it applies to
anonymous subs instead of named subs. For example</p>

<p>perltidy -asbl</p>

<p>produces this result:</p>

<p>$a = sub { if ( !defined( $_[0] ) ) { print(&quot;Hello,
World0); } else { print( $_[0], &quot;0 ); } };</p>

<p>This flag is negated with -nasbl, and the default is
-nasbl.</p>

<p>-bli, --brace-left-and-indent The flag -bli is the same
as -bl but in addition it causes one unit of continuation
indentation ( see -ci ) to be placed before an opening and
closing block braces.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>if ( $input_file eq &rsquo;-&rsquo; ) # -bli {
important_function(); }</p>

<p>By default, this extra indentation occurs for blocks of
type: if, elsif, else, unless, for, foreach, sub, while,
until, and also with a preceding label. The next item shows
how to change this.</p>

<p>-blil=s, --brace-left-and-indent-list=s Use this
parameter to change the types of block braces for which the
-bli flag applies; see &quot;Specifying Block Types&quot;.
For example, -blil= if elsif else would apply it to only
&quot;if/elsif/else&quot; blocks.</p>

<p>-bar, --opening-brace-always-on-right The default style,
-nbl places the opening code block brace on a new line if it
does not fit on the same line as the opening keyword, like
this:</p>

<p>if ( $bigwasteofspace1 &amp;&amp; $bigwasteofspace2 ||
$bigwasteofspace3 &amp;&amp; $bigwasteofspace4 ) {
big_waste_of_time(); }</p>

<p>To force the opening brace to always be on the right,
use the -bar flag. In this case, the above example
becomes</p>

<p>if ( $bigwasteofspace1 &amp;&amp; $bigwasteofspace2 ||
$bigwasteofspace3 &amp;&amp; $bigwasteofspace4 ) {
big_waste_of_time(); }</p>

<p>A conflict occurs if both -bl and -bar are
specified.</p>

<p>-otr, --opening-token-right and related flags The -otr
flag is a hint that perltidy should not place a break
between a comma and an opening token. For example:</p>

<p># default formatting push @{ $self-&gt;{$module}{$key}
}, { accno =&gt; $ref-&gt;{accno}, description =&gt;
$ref-&gt;{description} };</p>

<p># perltidy -otr push @{ $self-&gt;{$module}{$key} }, {
accno =&gt; $ref-&gt;{accno}, description =&gt;
$ref-&gt;{description} };</p>

<p>The flag -otr is actually a synonym for three other
flags which can be used to control parens, hash braces, and
square brackets separately if desired:</p>

<p>-opr or --opening-paren-right -ohbr or
--opening-hash-brace-right -osbr or
--opening-square-bracket-right</p>

<p>Vertical tightness of non-block curly braces,
parentheses, and square brackets. These parameters control
what shall be called vertical tightness. Here are the main
points:</p>

<p>&middot; Opening tokens (except for block braces) are
controlled by -vt=n, or --vertical-tightness=n, where</p>

<p>-vt=0 always break a line after opening token (default).
-vt=1 do not break unless this would produce more than one
step in indentation in a line. -vt=2 never break a line
after opening token</p>

<p>&middot; You must also use the -lp flag when you use the
-vt flag; the reason is explained below.</p>

<p>&middot; Closing tokens (except for block braces) are
controlled by -vtc=n, or --vertical-tightness-closing=n,
where</p>

<p>-vtc=0 always break a line before a closing token
(default), -vtc=1 do not break before a closing token which
is followed by a semicolon or another closing token, and is
not in a list environment. -vtc=2 never break before a
closing token.</p>

<p>The rules for -vtc=1 are designed to maintain a
reasonable balance between tightness and readability in
complex lists.</p>

<p>&middot; Different controls may be applied to to
different token types, and it is also possible to control
block braces; see below.</p>

<p>&middot; Finally, please note that these vertical
tightness flags are merely hints to the formatter, and it
cannot always follow them. Things which make it difficult or
impossible include comments, blank lines, blocks of code
within a list, and possibly the lack of the -lp parameter.
Also, these flags may be ignored for very small lists (2 or
3 lines in length).</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -vt=0 -vtc=0 %romanNumerals = ( one =&gt;
&rsquo;I&rsquo;, two =&gt; &rsquo;II&rsquo;, three =&gt;
&rsquo;III&rsquo;, four =&gt; &rsquo;IV&rsquo;, );</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -vt=1 -vtc=0 %romanNumerals = ( one =&gt;
&rsquo;I&rsquo;, two =&gt; &rsquo;II&rsquo;, three =&gt;
&rsquo;III&rsquo;, four =&gt; &rsquo;IV&rsquo;, );</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -vt=1 -vtc=1 %romanNumerals = ( one =&gt;
&rsquo;I&rsquo;, two =&gt; &rsquo;II&rsquo;, three =&gt;
&rsquo;III&rsquo;, four =&gt; &rsquo;IV&rsquo;, );</p>

<p>The difference between -vt=1 and -vt=2 is shown
here:</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -vt=1 $init-&gt;add( mysprintf(
&quot;(void)find_threadsv(%s);&quot;, cstring(
$threadsv_names[ $op-&gt;targ ] ) ) );</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -vt=2 $init-&gt;add( mysprintf(
&quot;(void)find_threadsv(%s);&quot;, cstring(
$threadsv_names[ $op-&gt;targ ] ) ) );</p>

<p>With -vt=1, the line ending in &quot;add(&quot; does not
combine with the next line because the next line is not
balanced. This can help with readability, but -vt=2 can be
used to ignore this rule.</p>

<p>The tightest, and least readable, code is produced with
both &quot;-vt=2&quot; and &quot;-vtc=2&quot;:</p>

<p># perltidy -lp -vt=2 -vtc=2 $init-&gt;add( mysprintf(
&quot;(void)find_threadsv(%s);&quot;, cstring(
$threadsv_names[ $op-&gt;targ ] ) ) );</p>

<p>Notice how the code in all of these examples collapses
vertically as -vt increases, but the indentation remains
unchanged. This is because perltidy implements the -vt
parameter by first formatting as if -vt=0, and then simply
overwriting one output line on top of the next, if possible,
to achieve the desired vertical tightness. The -lp
indentation style has been designed to allow this vertical
collapse to occur, which is why it is required for the -vt
parameter.</p>

<p>The -vt=n and -vtc=n parameters apply to each type of
container token. If desired, vertical tightness controls can
be applied independently to each of the closing container
token types.</p>

<p>The parameters for controlling parentheses are -pvt=n or
--paren-vertical-tightness=n, and -pcvt=n or
--paren-vertical-tightness-closing=n.</p>

<p>Likewise, the parameters for square brackets are -sbvt=n
or --square-bracket-vertical-tightness=n, and -sbcvt=n or
--square-bracket-vertical-tightness-closing=n.</p>

<p>Finally, the parameters for controlling non-code block
braces are -bvt=n or --brace-vertical-tightness=n, and
-bcvt=n or --brace-vertical-tightness-closing=n.</p>

<p>In fact, the parameter -vt=n is actually just an
abbreviation for -pvt=n -bvt=n sbvt=n, and likewise -vtc=n
is an abbreviation for -pvtc=n -bvtc=n sbvtc=n.</p>

<p>-bbvt=n or --block-brace-vertical-tightness=n The
-bbvt=n flag is just like the -vt=n flag but applies to
opening code block braces.</p>

<p>-bbvt=0 break after opening block brace (default).
-bbvt=1 do not break unless this would produce more than one
step in indentation in a line. -bbvt=2 do not break after
opening block brace.</p>

<p>It is necessary to also use either -bl or -bli for this
to work, because, as with other vertical tightness controls,
it is implemented by simply overwriting a line ending with
an opening block brace with the subsequent line. For
example:</p>

<p># perltidy -bli -bbvt=0 if ( open( FILE, &quot;&lt;
$File&quot; ) ) { while ( $File = &lt;FILE&gt; ) { $In .=
$File; $count++; } close(FILE); }</p>

<p># perltidy -bli -bbvt=1 if ( open( FILE, &quot;&lt;
$File&quot; ) ) { while ( $File = &lt;FILE&gt; ) { $In .=
$File; $count++; } close(FILE); }</p>

<p>By default this applies to blocks associated with
keywords if, elsif, else, unless, for, foreach, sub, while,
until, and also with a preceding label. This can be changed
with the parameter -bbvtl=string, or
--block-brace-vertical-tightness-list=string, where string
is a space-separated list of block types. For more
information on the possible values of this string, see
&quot;Specifying Block Types&quot;</p>

<p>For example, if we want to just apply this style to
&quot;if&quot;, &quot;elsif&quot;, and &quot;else&quot;
blocks, we could use &quot;perltidy -bli -bbvt=1
-bbvtl=&rsquo;if elsif else&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p>There is no vertical tightness control for closing block
braces; with the exception of one-line blocks, they will
normally remain on a separate line.</p>

<p>-sot, --stack-opening-tokens and related flags The -sot
flag tells perltidy to &quot;stack&quot; opening tokens when
possible to avoid lines with isolated opening tokens.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p># default $opt_c = Text::CSV_XS-&gt;new( { binary =&gt;
1, sep_char =&gt; $opt_c, always_quote =&gt; 1, } );</p>

<p># -sot $opt_c = Text::CSV_XS-&gt;new( { binary =&gt; 1,
sep_char =&gt; $opt_c, always_quote =&gt; 1, } );</p>

<p>For detailed control of individual closing tokens the
following controls can be used:</p>

<p>-sop or --stack-opening-paren -sohb or
--stack-opening-hash-brace -sosb or
--stack-opening-square-bracket</p>

<p>The flag -sot is a synonym for -sop -sohb -sosb.</p>

<p>-sct, --stack-closing-tokens and related flags The -sct
flag tells perltidy to &quot;stack&quot; closing tokens when
possible to avoid lines with isolated closing tokens.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p># default $opt_c = Text::CSV_XS-&gt;new( { binary =&gt;
1, sep_char =&gt; $opt_c, always_quote =&gt; 1, } );</p>

<p># -sct $opt_c = Text::CSV_XS-&gt;new( { binary =&gt; 1,
sep_char =&gt; $opt_c, always_quote =&gt; 1, } );</p>

<p>The -sct flag is somewhat similar to the -vtc flags, and
in some cases it can give a similar result. The difference
is that the -vtc flags try to avoid lines with leading
opening tokens by &quot;hiding&quot; them at the end of a
previous line, whereas the -sct flag merely tries to reduce
the number of lines with isolated closing tokens by stacking
them but does not try to hide them. For example:</p>

<p># -vtc=2 $opt_c = Text::CSV_XS-&gt;new( { binary =&gt;
1, sep_char =&gt; $opt_c, always_quote =&gt; 1, } );</p>

<p>For detailed control of the stacking of individual
closing tokens the following controls can be used:</p>

<p>-scp or --stack-closing-paren -schb or
--stack-closing-hash-brace -scsb or
--stack-closing-square-bracket</p>

<p>The flag -sct is a synonym for -scp -schb -scsb.</p>

<p>-dnl, --delete-old-newlines By default, perltidy first
deletes all old line break locations, and then it looks for
good break points to match the desired line length. Use
-ndnl or --nodelete-old-newlines to force perltidy to retain
all old line break points.</p>

<p>-anl, --add-newlines By default, perltidy will add line
breaks when necessary to create continuations of long lines
and to improve the script appearance. Use -nanl or
--noadd-newlines to prevent any new line breaks.</p>

<p>This flag does not prevent perltidy from eliminating
existing line breaks; see --freeze-newlines to completely
prevent changes to line break points.</p>

<p>Controlling whether perltidy breaks before or after
operators Four command line parameters provide some control
over whether a line break should be before or after specific
token types. Two parameters give detailed control:</p>

<p>-wba=s or --want-break-after=s, and</p>

<p>-wbb=s or --want-break-before=s.</p>

<p>These parameters are each followed by a quoted string,
s, containing a list of token types (separated only by
spaces). No more than one of each of these parameters should
be specified, because repeating a command-line parameter
always overwrites the previous one before perltidy ever sees
it.</p>

<p>By default, perltidy breaks after these token types: % +
- * / x != == &gt;= &lt;= =~ !~ &lt; &gt; | &amp; = **= +=
*= &amp;= &lt;&lt;= &amp;&amp;= -= /= |= &gt;&gt;= ||= //=
.= %= ^= x=</p>

<p>And perltidy breaks before these token types by default:
. &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; -&gt; &amp;&amp; || //</p>

<p>To illustrate, to cause a break after a concatenation
operator, &rsquo;.&rsquo;, rather than before it, the
command line would be</p>

<p>-wba=&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>As another example, the following command would cause a
break before math operators &rsquo;+&rsquo;,
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, &rsquo;/&rsquo;, and &rsquo;*&rsquo;:</p>

<p>-wbb=&quot;+ - / *&quot;</p>

<p>These commands should work well for most of the token
types that perltidy uses (use --dump-token-types for a
list). Also try the -D flag on a short snippet of code and
look at the .DEBUG file to see the tokenization. However,
for a few token types there may be conflicts with hardwired
logic which cause unexpected results. One example is curly
braces, which should be controlled with the parameter bl
provided for that purpose.</p>

<p>WARNING Be sure to put these tokens in quotes to avoid
having them misinterpreted by your command shell.</p>

<p>Two additional parameters are available which, though
they provide no further capability, can simplify input
are:</p>

<p>-baao or --break-after-all-operators,</p>

<p>-bbao or --break-before-all-operators.</p>

<p>The -baao sets the default to be to break after all of
the following operators:</p>

<p>% + - * / x != == &gt;= &lt;= =~ !~ &lt; &gt; | &amp; =
**= += *= &amp;= &lt;&lt;= &amp;&amp;= -= /= |= &gt;&gt;=
||= //= .= %= ^= x= . : ? &amp;&amp; || and or err xor</p>

<p>and the -bbao flag sets the default to break before all
of these operators. These can be used to define an initial
break preference which can be fine-tuned with the -wba and
-wbb flags. For example, to break before all operators
except an = one could use --bbao -wba= = rather than listing
every single perl operator except = on a -wbb flag.</p>

<p>Controlling List Formatting Perltidy attempts to place
comma-separated arrays of values in tables which look good.
Its default algorithms usually work well, and they have been
improving with each release, but several parameters are
available to control list formatting.</p>

<p>-boc, --break-at-old-comma-breakpoints This flag tells
perltidy to try to break at all old commas. This is not the
default. Normally, perltidy makes a best guess at list
formatting, and seldom uses old comma breakpoints. Usually
this works well, but consider:</p>

<p>my @list = (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 6, 4,
1,);</p>

<p>The default formatting will flatten this down to one
line:</p>

<p># perltidy (default) my @list = ( 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1,
3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, );</p>

<p>which hides the structure. Using -boc, plus additional
flags to retain the original style, yields</p>

<p># perltidy -boc -lp -pt=2 -vt=1 -vtc=1 my @list = (1, 1,
1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 6, 4, 1,);</p>

<p>A disadvantage of this flag is that all tables in the
file must already be nicely formatted. For another
possibility see the -fs flag in &quot;Skipping Selected
Sections of Code&quot;.</p>

<p>-mft=n, --maximum-fields-per-table=n If the computed
number of fields for any table exceeds n, then it will be
reduced to n. The default value for n is a large number, 40.
While this value should probably be left unchanged as a
general rule, it might be used on a small section of code to
force a list to have a particular number of fields per line,
and then either the -boc flag could be used to retain this
formatting, or a single comment could be introduced
somewhere to freeze the formatting in future applications of
perltidy.</p>

<p># perltidy -mft=2 @month_of_year = ( &rsquo;Jan&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Feb&rsquo;, &rsquo;Mar&rsquo;, &rsquo;Apr&rsquo;,
&rsquo;May&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jun&rsquo;, &rsquo;Jul&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Aug&rsquo;, &rsquo;Sep&rsquo;, &rsquo;Oct&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Nov&rsquo;, &rsquo;Dec&rsquo; );</p>

<p>-cab=n, --comma-arrow-breakpoints=n A comma which
follows a comma arrow, =&gt; , requires special
consideration. In a long list, it is common to break at all
such commas. This parameter can be used to control how
perltidy breaks at these commas. (However, it will have no
effect if old comma breaks are being forced because -boc is
used). The possible values of n are:</p>

<p>n=0 break at all commas after =&gt; n=1 stable: break at
all commas after =&gt; unless this would break an existing
one-line container (default) n=2 break at all commas after
=&gt;, but try to form the maximum maximum one-line
container lengths n=3 do not treat commas after =&gt;
specially at all</p>

<p>For example, given the following single line, perltidy
by default will not add any line breaks because it would
break the existing one-line container:</p>

<p>bless { B =&gt; $B, Root =&gt; $Root } =&gt;
$package;</p>

<p>Using -cab=0 will force a break after each comma-arrow
item:</p>

<p># perltidy -cab=0: bless { B =&gt; $B, Root =&gt; $Root
} =&gt; $package;</p>

<p>If perltidy is subsequently run with this container
broken, then by default it will break after each =&gt;
because the container is now broken. To reform a one-line
container, the parameter -cab=2 would be needed.</p>

<p>The flag -cab=3 can be used to prevent these commas from
being treated specially. In this case, an item such as
&quot;01&quot; =&gt; 31 is treated as a single item in a
table. The number of fields in this table will be determined
by the same rules that are used for any other table. Here is
an example.</p>

<p># perltidy -cab=3 my %last_day = ( &quot;01&quot; =&gt;
31, &quot;02&quot; =&gt; 29, &quot;03&quot; =&gt; 31,
&quot;04&quot; =&gt; 30, &quot;05&quot; =&gt; 31,
&quot;06&quot; =&gt; 30, &quot;07&quot; =&gt; 31,
&quot;08&quot; =&gt; 31, &quot;09&quot; =&gt; 30,
&quot;10&quot; =&gt; 31, &quot;11&quot; =&gt; 30,
&quot;12&quot; =&gt; 31 );</p>

<p>Retaining or Ignoring Existing Line Breaks Several
additional parameters are available for controlling the
extent to which line breaks in the input script influence
the output script. In most cases, the default parameter
values are set so that, if a choice is possible, the output
style follows the input style. For example, if a short
logical container is broken in the input script, then the
default behavior is for it to remain broken in the output
script.</p>

<p>Most of the parameters in this section would only be
required for a one-time conversion of a script from short
container lengths to longer container lengths. The opposite
effect, of converting long container lengths to shorter
lengths, can be obtained by temporarily using a short
maximum line length.</p>

<p>-bol, --break-at-old-logical-breakpoints By default, if
a logical expression is broken at a &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;,
&quot;||&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, or &quot;or&quot;, then the
container will remain broken. Also, breaks at internal
keywords &quot;if&quot; and &quot;unless&quot; will normally
be retained. To prevent this, and thus form longer lines,
use -nbol.</p>

<p>-bok, --break-at-old-keyword-breakpoints By default,
perltidy will retain a breakpoint before keywords which may
return lists, such as &quot;sort&quot; and &lt;map&gt;. This
allows chains of these operators to be displayed one per
line. Use -nbok to prevent retaining these breakpoints.</p>

<p>-bot, --break-at-old-ternary-breakpoints By default, if
a conditional (ternary) operator is broken at a
&quot;:&quot;, then it will remain broken. To prevent this,
and thereby form longer lines, use -nbot.</p>

<p>-iob, --ignore-old-breakpoints Use this flag to tell
perltidy to ignore existing line breaks to the maximum
extent possible. This will tend to produce the longest
possible containers, regardless of type, which do not exceed
the line length limit.</p>

<p>-kis, --keep-interior-semicolons Use the -kis flag to
prevent breaking at a semicolon if there was no break there
in the input file. Normally perltidy places a newline after
each semicolon which terminates a statement unless several
statements are contained within a one-line brace block. To
illustrate, consider the following input lines:</p>

<p>dbmclose(%verb_delim); undef %verb_delim;
dbmclose(%expanded); undef %expanded;</p>

<p>The default is to break after each statement, giving</p>

<p>dbmclose(%verb_delim); undef %verb_delim;
dbmclose(%expanded); undef %expanded;</p>

<p>With perltidy -kis the multiple statements are
retained:</p>

<p>dbmclose(%verb_delim); undef %verb_delim;
dbmclose(%expanded); undef %expanded;</p>

<p>The statements are still subject to the specified value
of maximum- line-length and will be broken if this maximum
is exceeed.</p>

<p>Blank Line Control Blank lines can improve the
readability of a script if they are carefully placed.
Perltidy has several commands for controlling the insertion,
retention, and removal of blank lines.</p>

<p>-fbl, --freeze-blank-lines Set -fbl if you want to the
blank lines in your script to remain exactly as they are.
The rest of the parameters in this section may then be
ignored. (Note: setting the -fbl flag is equivalent to
setting -mbl=0 and -kbl=2).</p>

<p>-bbc, --blanks-before-comments A blank line will be
introduced before a full-line comment. This is the default.
Use -nbbc or --noblanks-before-comments to prevent such
blank lines from being introduced.</p>

<p>-bbs, --blanks-before-subs A blank line will be
introduced before a sub definition, unless it is a one-liner
or preceded by a comment. A blank line will also be
introduced before a package statement and a BEGIN and END
block. This is the default. The intention is to help display
the structure of a program by setting off certain key
sections of code. This is negated with -nbbs or
--noblanks-before-subs.</p>

<p>-bbb, --blanks-before-blocks A blank line will be
introduced before blocks of coding delimited by for,
foreach, while, until, and if, unless, in the following
circumstances:</p>

<p>&middot; The block is not preceded by a comment.</p>

<p>&middot; The block is not a one-line block.</p>

<p>&middot; The number of consecutive non-blank lines at
the current indentation depth is at least -lbl (see next
section).</p>

<p>This is the default. The intention of this option is to
introduce some space within dense coding. This is negated
with -nbbb or --noblanks-before-blocks.</p>

<p>-lbl=n --long-block-line-count=n This controls how often
perltidy is allowed to add blank lines before certain block
types (see previous section). The default is 8. Entering a
value of 0 is equivalent to entering a very large
number.</p>

<p>-mbl=n --maximum-consecutive-blank-lines=n This
parameter specifies the maximum number of consecutive blank
lines which will be output within code sections of a script.
The default is n=1. If the input file has more than n
consecutive blank lines, the number will be reduced to n. If
n=0 then no blank lines will be output (unless all old blank
lines are retained with the -kbl=2 flag of the next
section).</p>

<p>This flag obviously does not apply to pod sections,
here-documents, and quotes.</p>

<p>-kbl=n, --keep-old-blank-lines=n The -kbl=n flag gives
you control over how your existing blank lines are
treated.</p>

<p>The possible values of n are:</p>

<p>n=0 ignore all old blank lines n=1 stable: keep old
blanks, but limited by the value of the B&lt;-mbl=n&gt; flag
n=2 keep all old blank lines, regardless of the value of the
B&lt;-mbl=n&gt; flag</p>

<p>The default is n=1.</p>

<p>-sob, --swallow-optional-blank-lines This is equivalent
to kbl=0 and is included for compatability with previous
versions.</p>

<p>-nsob, --noswallow-optional-blank-lines This is
equivalent to kbl=1 and is included for compatability with
previous versions.</p>

<p>Styles A style refers to a convenient collection of
existing parameters.</p>

<p>-gnu, --gnu-style -gnu gives an approximation to the GNU
Coding Standards (which do not apply to perl) as they are
sometimes implemented. At present, this style overrides the
default style with the following parameters:</p>

<p>-lp -bl -noll -pt=2 -bt=2 -sbt=2 -icp</p>

<p>-pbp, --perl-best-practices -pbp is an abbreviation for
the parameters in the book Perl Best Practices by Damian
Conway:</p>

<p>-l=78 -i=4 -ci=4 -st -se -vt=2 -cti=0 -pt=1 -bt=1 -sbt=1
-bbt=1 -nsfs -nolq -wbb=&quot;% + - * / x != == &gt;= &lt;=
=~ !~ &lt; &gt; | &amp; = **= += *= &amp;= &lt;&lt;=
&amp;&amp;= -= /= |= &gt;&gt;= ||= //= .= %= ^= x=&quot;</p>

<p>Note that the -st and -se flags make perltidy act as a
filter on one file only. These can be overridden with -nst
and -nse if necessary.</p>

<p>Other Controls Deleting selected text Perltidy can
selectively delete comments and/or pod documentation. The
command -dac or --delete-all-comments will delete all
comments and all pod documentation, leaving just code and
any leading system control lines.</p>

<p>The command -dp or --delete-pod will remove all pod
documentation (but not comments).</p>

<p>Two commands which remove comments (but not pod) are:
-dbc or --delete-block-comments and -dsc or
--delete-side-comments. (Hanging side comments will be
deleted with block comments here.)</p>

<p>The negatives of these commands also work, and are the
defaults. When block comments are deleted, any leading
hash-bang will be retained. Also, if the -x flag is used,
any system commands before a leading hash-bang will be
retained (even if they are in the form of comments).</p>

<p>Writing selected text to a file When perltidy writes a
formatted text file, it has the ability to also send
selected text to a file with a .TEE extension. This text can
include comments and pod documentation.</p>

<p>The command -tac or --tee-all-comments will write all
comments and all pod documentation.</p>

<p>The command -tp or --tee-pod will write all pod
documentation (but not comments).</p>

<p>The commands which write comments (but not pod) are:
-tbc or --tee-block-comments and -tsc or
--tee-side-comments. (Hanging side comments will be written
with block comments here.)</p>

<p>The negatives of these commands also work, and are the
defaults.</p>

<p>Using a .perltidyrc command file If you use perltidy
frequently, you probably won t be happy until you create a
.perltidyrc file to avoid typing commonly-used parameters.
Perltidy will first look in your current directory for a
command file named .perltidyrc. If it does not find one, it
will continue looking for one in other standard
locations.</p>

<p>These other locations are system-dependent, and may be
displayed with the command &quot;perltidy -dpro&quot;. Under
Unix systems, it will first look for an environment variable
PERLTIDY. Then it will look for a .perltidyrc file in the
home directory, and then for a system-wide file
/usr/local/etc/perltidyrc, and then it will look for
/etc/perltidyrc. Note that these last two system-wide files
do not have a leading dot. Further system-dependent
information will be found in the INSTALL file distributed
with perltidy.</p>

<p>Under Windows, perltidy will also search for a
configuration file named perltidy.ini since Windows does not
allow files with a leading period (.). Use &quot;perltidy
-dpro&quot; to see the possbile locations for your system.
An example might be C:Documents and SettingsAll
Usersperltidy.ini.</p>

<p>Another option is the use of the PERLTIDY environment
variable. The method for setting environment variables
depends upon the version of Windows that you are using.
Instructions for Windows 95 and later versions can be found
here:</p>


<p>http://www.netmanage.com/000/20021101_005_tcm21-6336.pdf</p>

<p>Under Windows NT / 2000 / XP the PERLTIDY environment
variable can be placed in either the user section or the
system section. The later makes the configuration file
common to all users on the machine. Be sure to enter the
full path of the configuration file in the value of the
environment variable. Ex. PERLTIDY=C: The configuation file
is free format, and simply a list of parameters, just as
they would be entered on a command line. Any number of lines
may be used, with any number of parameters per line,
although it may be easiest to read with one parameter per
line. Blank lines are ignored, and text after a # is ignored
to the end of a line.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a .perltidyrc file:</p>

<p># This is a simple of a .perltidyrc configuration file #
This implements a highly spaced style -se # errors to
standard error output -w # show all warnings -bl # braces on
new lines -pt=0 # parens not tight at all -bt=0 # braces not
tight -sbt=0 # square brackets not tight</p>

<p>The parameters in the .perltidyrc file are installed
first, so any parameters given on the command line will have
priority over them.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, perltidy ignores any command in the
.perltidyrc file which would cause some kind of dump and an
exit. These are:</p>

<p>-h -v -ddf -dln -dop -dsn -dtt -dwls -dwrs -ss</p>

<p>There are several options may be helpful in debugging a
.perltidyrc file:</p>

<p>&middot; A very helpful command is --dump-profile or
-dpro. It writes a list of all configuration filenames
tested to standard output, and if a file is found, it dumps
the content to standard output before exiting. So, to find
out where perltidy looks for its configuration files, and
which one if any it selects, just enter</p>

<p>perltidy -dpro</p>

<p>&middot; It may be simplest to develop and test
configuration files with alternative names, and invoke them
with -pro=filename on the command line. Then rename the
desired file to .perltidyrc when finished.</p>

<p>&middot; The parameters in the .perltidyrc file can be
switched off with the -npro option.</p>

<p>&middot; The commands --dump-options, --dump-defaults,
--dump-long-names, and --dump-short-names, all described
below, may all be helpful.</p>

<p>Creating a new abbreviation A special notation is
available for use in a .perltidyrc file for creating an
abbreviation for a group of options. This can be used to
create a shorthand for one or more styles which are
frequently, but not always, used. The notation is to group
the options within curly braces which are preceded by the
name of the alias (without leading dashes), like this:</p>

<p>newword { -opt1 -opt2 }</p>

<p>where newword is the abbreviation, and opt1, etc, are
existing parameters or other abbreviations. The main syntax
requirement is that the new abbreviation must begin on a new
line. Space before and after the curly braces is optional.
For a specific example, the following line</p>

<p>airy {-bl -pt=0 -bt=0 -sbt=0}</p>

<p>could be placed in a .perltidyrc file, and then invoked
at will with</p>

<p>perltidy -airy somefile.pl</p>

<p>(Either &quot;-airy&quot; or &quot;--airy&quot; may be
used).</p>

<p>Skipping leading non-perl commands with -x or
--look-for-hash-bang If your script has leading lines of
system commands or other text which are not valid perl code,
and which are separated from the start of the perl code by a
&quot;hash-bang&quot; line, ( a line of the form
&quot;#!...perl&quot; ), you must use the -x flag to tell
perltidy not to parse and format any lines before the
&quot;hash-bang&quot; line. This option also invokes perl
with a -x flag when checking the syntax. This option was
originally added to allow perltidy to parse interactive VMS
scripts, but it should be used for any script which is
normally invoked with &quot;perl -x&quot;.</p>

<p>Making a file unreadable The goal of perltidy is to
improve the readability of files, but there are two commands
which have the opposite effect, --mangle and --extrude. They
are actually merely aliases for combinations of other
parameters. Both of these strip all possible whitespace, but
leave comments and pod documents, so that they are
essentially reversible. The difference between these is that
--mangle puts the fewest possible line breaks in a script
while --extrude puts the maximum possible. Note that these
options do not provided any meaningful obfuscation, because
perltidy can be used to reformat the files. They were
originally developed to help test the tokenization logic of
perltidy, but they have other uses. One use for --mangle is
the following:</p>

<p>perltidy --mangle myfile.pl -st | perltidy -o
myfile.pl.new</p>

<p>This will form the maximum possible number of one-line
blocks (see next section), and can sometimes help clean up a
badly formatted script.</p>

<p>A similar technique can be used with --extrude instead
of --mangle to make the minimum number of one-line
blocks.</p>

<p>Another use for --mangle is to combine it with -dac to
reduce the file size of a perl script.</p>

<p>One-line blocks There are a few points to note regarding
one-line blocks. A one- line block is something like
this,</p>

<p>if ($x &gt; 0) { $y = 1 / $x }</p>

<p>where the contents within the curly braces is short
enough to fit on a single line.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, perltidy retains existing one-line
blocks, if it is possible within the line-length constraint,
but it does not attempt to form new ones. In other words,
perltidy will try to follow the one-line block style of the
input file.</p>

<p>If an existing one-line block is longer than the maximum
line length, however, it will be broken into multiple lines.
When this happens, perltidy checks for and adds any optional
terminating semicolon (unless the -nasc option is used) if
the block is a code block.</p>

<p>The main exception is that perltidy will attempt to form
new one- line blocks following the keywords &quot;map&quot;,
&quot;eval&quot;, and &quot;sort&quot;, because these code
blocks are often small and most clearly displayed in a
single line.</p>

<p>One-line block rules can conflict with the cuddled-else
option. When the cuddled-else option is used, perltidy
retains existing one-line blocks, even if they do not obey
cuddled-else formatting.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when one-line blocks get broken because
they exceed the available line length, the formatting will
violate the requested brace style. If this happens,
reformatting the script a second time should correct the
problem.</p>

<p>Debugging The following flags are available for
debugging:</p>

<p>--dump-defaults or -ddf will write the default option
set to standard output and quit</p>

<p>--dump-profile or -dpro will write the name of the
current configuration file and its contents to standard
output and quit.</p>

<p>--dump-options or -dop will write current option set to
standard output and quit.</p>

<p>--dump-long-names or -dln will write all command line
long names (passed to Get_options) to standard output and
quit.</p>

<p>--dump-short-names or -dsn will write all command line
short names to standard output and quit.</p>

<p>--dump-token-types or -dtt will write a list of all
token types to standard output and quit.</p>

<p>--dump-want-left-space or -dwls will write the hash
%want_left_space to standard output and quit. See the
section on controlling whitespace around tokens.</p>

<p>--dump-want-right-space or -dwrs will write the hash
%want_right_space to standard output and quit. See the
section on controlling whitespace around tokens.</p>

<p>-DEBUG will write a file with extension .DEBUG for each
input file showing the tokenization of all lines of
code.</p>

<p>Working with MakeMaker, AutoLoader and SelfLoader The
first $VERSION line of a file which might be evald by
MakeMaker is passed through unchanged except for
indentation. Use --nopass-version-line, or -npvl, to
deactivate this feature.</p>

<p>If the AutoLoader module is used, perltidy will continue
formatting code after seeing an __END__ line. Use
--nolook-for-autoloader, or -nlal, to deactivate this
feature.</p>

<p>Likewise, if the SelfLoader module is used, perltidy
will continue formatting code after seeing a __DATA__ line.
Use --nolook-for-selfloader, or -nlsl, to deactivate this
feature.</p>

<p>Working around problems with older version of Perl
Perltidy contains a number of rules which help avoid known
subtleties and problems with older versions of perl, and
these rules always take priority over whatever formatting
flags have been set. For example, perltidy will usually
avoid starting a new line with a bareword, because this
might cause problems if &quot;use strict&quot; is
active.</p>

<p>There is no way to override these rules.</p>

<p>HTML OPTIONS The -html master switch The flag -html
causes perltidy to write an html file with extension .html.
So, for example, the following command</p>

<p>perltidy -html somefile.pl</p>

<p>will produce a syntax-colored html file named
somefile.pl.html which may be viewed with a browser.</p>

<p>Please Note: In this case, perltidy does not do any
formatting to the input file, and it does not write a
formatted file with extension .tdy. This means that two
perltidy runs are required to create a fully reformatted,
html copy of a script.</p>

<p>The -pre flag for code snippets When the -pre flag is
given, only the pre-formatted section, within the
&lt;PRE&gt; and &lt;/PRE&gt; tags, will be output. This
simplifies inclusion of the output in other files. The
default is to output a complete web page.</p>

<p>The -nnn flag for line numbering When the -nnn flag is
given, the output lines will be numbered.</p>

<p>The -toc, or --html-table-of-contents flag By default, a
table of contents to packages and subroutines will be
written at the start of html output. Use -ntoc to prevent
this. This might be useful, for example, for a pod document
which contains a number of unrelated code snippets. This
flag only influences the code table of contents; it has no
effect on any table of contents produced by pod2html (see
next item).</p>

<p>The -pod, or --pod2html flag There are two options for
formatting pod documentation. The default is to pass the pod
through the Pod::Html module (which forms the basis of the
pod2html utility). Any code sections are formatted by
perltidy, and the results then merged. Note: perltidy
creates a temporary file when Pod::Html is used; see
&quot;FILES&quot;. Also, Pod::Html creates temporary files
for its cache.</p>

<p>NOTE: Perltidy counts the number of &quot;=cut&quot;
lines, and either moves the pod text to the top of the html
file if there is one &quot;=cut&quot;, or leaves the pod
text in its original order (interleaved with code)
otherwise.</p>

<p>Most of the flags accepted by pod2html may be included
in the perltidy command line, and they will be passed to
pod2html. In some cases, the flags have a prefix
&quot;pod&quot; to emphasize that they are for the pod2html,
and this prefix will be removed before they are passed to
pod2html. The flags which have the additional
&quot;pod&quot; prefix are:</p>

<p>--[no]podheader --[no]podindex --[no]podrecurse
--[no]podquiet --[no]podverbose --podflush</p>

<p>The flags which are unchanged from their use in pod2html
are:</p>

<p>--backlink=s --cachedir=s --htmlroot=s --libpods=s
--title=s --podpath=s --podroot=s</p>

<p>where s is an appropriate character string. Not all of
these flags are available in older versions of Pod::Html.
See your Pod::Html documentation for more information.</p>

<p>The alternative, indicated with -npod, is not to use
Pod::Html, but rather to format pod text in italics (or
whatever the stylesheet indicates), without special html
markup. This is useful, for example, if pod is being used as
an alternative way to write comments.</p>

<p>The -frm, or --frames flag By default, a single html
output file is produced. This can be changed with the -frm
option, which creates a frame holding a table of contents in
the left panel and the source code in the right side. This
simplifies code browsing. Assume, for example, that the
input file is MyModule.pm. Then, for default file extension
choices, these three files will be created:</p>

<p>MyModule.pm.html - the frame MyModule.pm.toc.html - the
table of contents MyModule.pm.src.html - the formatted
source code</p>

<p>Obviously this file naming scheme requires that output
be directed to a real file (as opposed to, say, standard
output). If this is not the case, or if the file extension
is unknown, the -frm option will be ignored.</p>

<p>The -text=s, or --html-toc-extension flag Use this flag
to specify the extra file extension of the table of contents
file when html frames are used. The default is
&quot;toc&quot;. See &quot;Specifying File
Extensions&quot;.</p>

<p>The -sext=s, or --html-src-extension flag Use this flag
to specify the extra file extension of the content file when
html frames are used. The default is &quot;src&quot;. See
&quot;Specifying File Extensions&quot;.</p>

<p>The -hent, or --html-entities flag This flag controls
the use of Html::Entities for html formatting. By default,
the module Html::Entities is used to encode special symbols.
This may not be the right thing for some browser/language
combinations. Use --nohtml-entities or -nhent to prevent
this.</p>

<p>Style Sheets Style sheets make it very convenient to
control and adjust the appearance of html pages. The default
behavior is to write a page of html with an embedded style
sheet.</p>

<p>An alternative to an embedded style sheet is to create a
page with a link to an external style sheet. This is
indicated with the -css=filename, where the external style
sheet is filename. The external style sheet filename will be
created if and only if it does not exist. This option is
useful for controlling multiple pages from a single style
sheet.</p>

<p>To cause perltidy to write a style sheet to standard
output and exit, use the -ss, or --stylesheet, flag. This is
useful if the style sheet could not be written for some
reason, such as if the -pre flag was used. Thus, for
example,</p>

<p>perltidy -html -ss &gt;mystyle.css</p>

<p>will write a style sheet with the default properties to
file mystyle.css.</p>

<p>The use of style sheets is encouraged, but a web page
without a style sheets can be created with the flag -nss.
Use this option if you must to be sure that older browsers
(roughly speaking, versions prior to 4.0 of Netscape
Navigator and Internet Explorer) can display the
syntax-coloring of the html files.</p>

<p>Controlling HTML properties Note: It is usually more
convenient to accept the default properties and then edit
the stylesheet which is produced. However, this section
shows how to control the properties with flags to
perltidy.</p>

<p>Syntax colors may be changed from their default values
by flags of the either the long form, -html-color-xxxxxx=n,
or more conveniently the short form, -hcx=n, where xxxxxx is
one of the following words, and x is the corresponding
abbreviation:</p>

<p>Token Type xxxxxx x ---------- -------- -- comment
comment c number numeric n identifier identifier i bareword,
function bareword w keyword keyword k quite, pattern quote q
here doc text here-doc-text h here doc target
here-doc-target hh punctuation punctuation pu parentheses
paren p structural braces structure s semicolon semicolon sc
colon colon co comma comma cm label label j sub definition
name subroutine m pod text pod-text pd</p>

<p>A default set of colors has been defined, but they may
be changed by providing values to any of the following
parameters, where n is either a 6 digit hex RGB color value
or an ascii name for a color, such as red.</p>

<p>To illustrate, the following command will produce an
html file somefile.pl.html with &quot;aqua&quot;
keywords:</p>

<p>perltidy -html -hck=00ffff somefile.pl</p>

<p>and this should be equivalent for most browsers:</p>

<p>perltidy -html -hck=aqua somefile.pl</p>

<p>Perltidy merely writes any non-hex names that it sees in
the html file. The following 16 color names are defined in
the HTML 3.2 standard:</p>

<p>black =&gt; 000000, silver =&gt; c0c0c0, gray =&gt;
808080, white =&gt; ffffff, maroon =&gt; 800000, red =&gt;
ff0000, purple =&gt; 800080, fuchsia =&gt; ff00ff, green
=&gt; 008000, lime =&gt; 00ff00, olive =&gt; 808000, yellow
=&gt; ffff00 navy =&gt; 000080, blue =&gt; 0000ff, teal
=&gt; 008080, aqua =&gt; 00ffff,</p>

<p>Many more names are supported in specific browsers, but
it is safest to use the hex codes for other colors. Helpful
color tables can be located with an internet search for
&quot;HTML color tables&quot;.</p>

<p>Besides color, two other character attributes may be
set: bold, and italics. To set a token type to use bold, use
the flag --html-bold-xxxxxx or -hbx, where xxxxxx or x are
the long or short names from the above table. Conversely, to
set a token type to NOT use bold, use --nohtml-bold-xxxxxx
or -nhbx.</p>

<p>Likewise, to set a token type to use an italic font, use
the flag --html-italic-xxxxxx or -hix, where again xxxxxx or
x are the long or short names from the above table. And to
set a token type to NOT use italics, use
--nohtml-italic-xxxxxx or -nhix.</p>

<p>For example, to use bold braces and lime color,
non-bold, italics keywords the following command would be
used:</p>

<p>perltidy -html -hbs -hck=00FF00 -nhbk -hik
somefile.pl</p>

<p>The background color can be specified with
--html-color-background=n, or -hcbg=n for short, where n is
a 6 character hex RGB value. The default color of text is
the value given to punctuation, which is black as a
default.</p>

<p>Here are some notes and hints:</p>

<p>1. If you find a preferred set of these parameters, you
may want to create a .perltidyrc file containing them. See
the perltidy man page for an explanation.</p>

<p>2. Rather than specifying values for these parameters,
it is probably easier to accept the defaults and then edit a
style sheet. The style sheet contains comments which should
make this easy.</p>

<p>3. The syntax-colored html files can be very large, so
it may be best to split large files into smaller pieces to
improve download times.</p>

<p>SOME COMMON INPUT CONVENTIONS Specifying Block Types
Several parameters which refer to code block types may be
customized by also specifying an associated list of block
types. The type of a block is the name of the keyword which
introduces that block, such as if, else, or sub. An
exception is a labeled block, which has no keyword, and
should be specified with just a colon.</p>

<p>For example, the following parameter specifies
&quot;sub&quot;, labels, &quot;BEGIN&quot;, and
&quot;END&quot; blocks:</p>

<p>-cscl=&quot;sub : BEGIN END&quot;</p>

<p>(the meaning of the -cscl parameter is described above.)
Note that quotes are required around the list of block types
because of the spaces.</p>

<p>Specifying File Extensions Several parameters allow
default file extensions to be overridden. For example, a
backup file extension may be specified with -bext=ext, where
ext is some new extension. In order to provides the user
some flexibility, the following convention is used in all
cases to decide if a leading . should be used. If the
extension &quot;ext&quot; begins with &quot;A-Z&quot;,
&quot;a-z&quot;, or &quot;0-9&quot;, then it will be
appended to the filename with an intermediate . (or perhaps
an _ on VMS systems). Otherwise, it will be appended
directly.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the file is somefile.pl. For
&quot;-bext=old&quot;, a . is added to give somefile.pl.old.
For &quot;-bext=.old&quot;, no additional . is added, so
again the backup file is somefile.pl.old. For
&quot;-bext=~&quot;, then no dot is added, and the backup
file will be somefile.pl~ .</p>

<p>SWITCHES WHICH MAY BE NEGATED The following list shows
all short parameter names which allow a prefix n to produce
the negated form:</p>

<p>D anl asc aws b bbb bbc bbs bl bli boc bok bol bot ce
csc dac dbc dcsc ddf dln dnl dop dp dpro dsc dsm dsn dtt
dwls dwrs dws f fll frm fs hsc html ibc icb icp iob isbc lal
log lp lsl ohbr okw ola oll opr opt osbr otr ple ple pod pvl
q sbc sbl schb scp scsb sct se sfp sfs skp sob sohb sop sosb
sot ssc st sts syn t tac tbc toc tp tqw tsc w x bar kis</p>

<p>Equivalently, the prefix no or no- on the corresponding
long names may be used.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS Parsing Limitations Perltidy should work
properly on most perl scripts. It does a lot of
self-checking, but still, it is possible that an error could
be introduced and go undetected. Therefore, it is essential
to make careful backups and to test reformatted scripts.</p>

<p>The main current limitation is that perltidy does not
scan modules included with use statements. This makes it
necessary to guess the context of any bare words introduced
by such modules. Perltidy has good guessing algorithms, but
they are not infallible. When it must guess, it leaves a
message in the log file.</p>

<p>If you encounter a bug, please report it.</p>

<p>What perltidy does not parse and format Perltidy indents
but does not reformat comments and &quot;qw&quot; quotes.
Perltidy does not in any way modify the contents of here
documents or quoted text, even if they contain source code.
(You could, however, reformat them separately). Perltidy
does not format format sections in any way. And, of course,
it does not modify pod documents.</p>

<p>FILES Temporary files Under the -html option with the
default --pod2html flag, a temporary file is required to
pass text to Pod::Html. Unix systems will try to use the
POSIX tmpnam() function. Otherwise the file perltidy.TMP
will be temporarily created in the current working
directory.</p>

<p>Special files when standard input is used When standard
input is used, the log file, if saved, is perltidy.LOG, and
any errors are written to perltidy.ERR unless the -se flag
is set. These are saved in the current working
directory.</p>

<p>Files overwritten The following file extensions are used
by perltidy, and files with these extensions may be
overwritten or deleted: .ERR, .LOG, .TEE, and/or .tdy,
.html, and .bak, depending on the run type and settings.</p>

<p>Files extensions limitations Perltidy does not operate
on files for which the run could produce a file with a
duplicated file extension. These extensions include .LOG,
.ERR, .TEE, and perhaps .tdy and .bak, depending on the run
type. The purpose of this rule is to prevent generating
confusing filenames such as somefile.tdy.tdy.tdy.</p>
