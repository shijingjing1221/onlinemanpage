<p>NAME locate - find files by name</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS locate [OPTION]... PATTERN...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION locate reads one or more databases prepared
by updatedb(8) and writes file names matching at least one
of the PATTERNs to standard output, one per line.</p>

<p>If --regex is not specified, PATTERNs can contain
globbing characters. If any PATTERN contains no globbing
characters, locate behaves as if the pattern were
*PATTERN*.</p>

<p>By default, locate does not check whether files found in
database still exist. locate can never report files created
after the most recent update of the relevant database.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS locate exits with status 0 if any match was
found or if locate was invoked with one of the --limit 0,
--help, --statistics or --version options. If no match was
found or a fatal error was encountered, locate exits with
status 1.</p>

<p>Errors encountered while reading a database are not
fatal, search con- tinues in other specified databases, if
any.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b, --basename Match only the base name against
the specified patterns. This is the opposite of
--wholename.</p>

<p>-c, --count Instead of writing file names on standard
output, write the num- ber of matching entries only.</p>

<p>-d, --database DBPATH Replace the default database with
DBPATH. DBPATH is a :-sepa- rated list of database file
names. If more than one --database option is specified, the
resulting path is a concatenation of the separate paths.</p>

<p>An empty database file name is replaced by the default
database. A database file name - refers to the standard
input. Note that a database can be read from the standard
input only once.</p>

<p>-e, --existing Print only entries that refer to files
existing at the time locate is run.</p>

<p>-L, --follow When checking whether files exist (if the
--existing option is specified), follow trailing symbolic
links. This causes broken symbolic links to be omitted from
the output.</p>

<p>This is the default behavior. The opposite can be
specified using --nofollow.</p>

<p>-h, --help Write a summary of the available options to
standard output and exit successfully.</p>

<p>-i, --ignore-case Ignore case distinctions when matching
patterns.</p>

<p>-l, --limit, -n LIMIT Exit successfully after finding
LIMIT entries. If the --count option is specified, the
resulting count is also limited to LIMIT.</p>

<p>-m, --mmap Ignored, for compatibility with BSD and GNU
locate.</p>

<p>-P, --nofollow, -H When checking whether files exist (if
the --existing option is specified), do not follow trailing
symbolic links. This causes broken symbolic links to be
reported like other files.</p>

<p>This is the opposite of --follow.</p>

<p>-0, --null Separate the entries on output using the
ASCII NUL character instead of writing each entry on a
separate line. This option is designed for interoperability
with the --null option of GNU xargs(1).</p>

<p>-S, --statistics Write statistics about each read
database to standard output instead of searching for files
and exit successfully.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Write no messages about errors encountered
while reading and processing databases.</p>

<p>-r, --regexp REGEXP Search for a basic regexp REGEXP. No
PATTERNs are allowed if this option is used, but this option
can be specified multiple times.</p>

<p>--regex Interpret all PATTERNs as extended regexps.</p>

<p>-s, --stdio Ignored, for compatibility with BSD and GNU
locate.</p>

<p>-V, --version Write information about the version and
license of locate on standard output and exit
successfully.</p>

<p>-w, --wholename Match only the whole path name against
the specified patterns.</p>

<p>This is the default behavior. The opposite can be
specified using --basename.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To search for a file named exactly NAME (not
*NAME*), use locate -NAME Because is a globbing character,
this disables the implicit replace- ment of NAME by
*NAME*.</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db The database searched
by default.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT LOCATE_PATH Path to additional databases,
added after the default database or the databases specified
using the --database option.</p>

<p>NOTES The order in which the requested databases are
processed is unspeci- fied, which allows locate to reorder
the database path for security reasons.</p>

<p>locate attempts to be compatible to slocate (without the
options used for creating databases) and GNU locate, in that
order. This is the reason for the impractical default
--follow option and for the confus- ing set of --regex and
--regexp options.</p>

<p>The short spelling of the -r option is incompatible to
GNU locate, where it corresponds to the --regex option. Use
the long option names to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>The LOCATE_PATH environment variable replaces the
default database in BSD and GNU locate, but it is added to
other databases in this imple- mentation and slocate.</p>
