<p>NAME dhclient.leases - DHCP client lease database</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client
keeps a persistent database of leases that it has acquired
that are still valid. The database is a free-form ASCII file
containing one valid declaration per lease. If more than one
declaration appears for a given lease, the last one in the
file is used. The file is written as a log, so this is not
an unusual occurrance.</p>

<p>The format of the lease declarations is described in
dhclient.conf(5).</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases</p>

<p>SEE ALSO dhclient(8), dhcp-options(5), dhclient.conf(5),
dhcpd(8), dhcpd.conf(5), RFC2132, RFC2131.</p>

<p>AUTHOR dhclient(8) was written by Ted Lemon under a
contract with Vixie Labs. Funding for this project was
provided by Internet Systems Consortium. Information about
