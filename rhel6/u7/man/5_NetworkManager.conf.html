<p>NAME NetworkManager.conf - NetworkManager configuration
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf or
&lt;SYSCONFDIR&gt;/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf where
&lt;SYSCONFDIR&gt; depends on your distribution or
build.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION NetworkManager.conf is a configuration file
for NetworkManager. It is used to set up various aspects of
NetworkManager s behavior. The loca- tion of the file may be
changed through use of the &quot;--config=&quot; argument
for NetworkManager (8).</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT The configuration file format is so-called
key file (sort of ini-style format). It consists of sections
(groups) of key-value pairs. Lines beginning with a # and
blank lines are considered comments. Sections are started by
a header line containing the section enclosed in [ and ],
and ended implicitly by the start of the next section or the
end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a
section. Minimal system settings configuration file looks
like this:</p>

<p>[main] plugins=keyfile</p>

<p>Description of sections and available keys follows:</p>

<p>[main] This section is the only mandatory section of the
configuration file.</p>

<p>plugins=plugin1,plugin2, ... List plugin names separated
by , . Plugins are used to read/write system-wide
connection. When more plugins are speci- fied, the
connections are read from all listed plugins. When writing
connections, the plugins will be asked to save the con-
nection in the order listed here. If the first plugin cannot
write out that connection type, or cant write out any
connec- tions, the next plugin is tried. If none of the
plugins can save the connection, the error is returned to
the user.</p>

<p>Available plugins:</p>

<p>keyfile plugin is the generic plugin that supports all
the con- nection types and capabilities that NetworkManager
has. It writes files out in a .ini-style format in /etc/Net-
workManager/system-connections. For security, it will ignore
files that are readable or writeable by any user or group
other than root since private keys and passphrases may be
stored in plaintext inside the file.</p>

<p>ifcfg-rh plugin is used on the Fedora and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux distributions to read and write
configuration from the standard
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files. It currently
supports reading wired, WiFi, and 802.1x connections, but
does not yet support reading or writing mobile broadband,
PPPoE, or VPN connections. To allow reading and writing of
these add keyfile plugin to your configuration as well.</p>

<p>ifupdown plugin is used on the Debian and Ubuntu
distributions, and reads connections from
/etc/network/interfaces. Since it cannot write connections
out (that support isnt planned), it is usually paired with
the keyfile plugin to enable saving and editing of new
connections. The ifup- down plugin supports basic wired and
WiFi connections, including WPA-PSK.</p>

<p>ifcfg-suse plugin is only provided for simple backward
compatibility with SUSE and OpenSUSE configuration. Most
setups should be using the keyfile plugin instead. The
ifcfg-suse plu- gin supports reading wired and WiFi
connections, but does not support saving any connection
types.</p>

<p>dhcp=dhclient | dhcpcd This key sets up what DHCP client
NetworkManager will use. Presently dhclient and dhcpcd are
supported. The client config- ured here should be available
on your system too. If this key is missing, available DHCP
clients are looked for in this order: dhclient, dhcpcd.</p>

<p>no-auto-default=&lt;hwaddr&gt;,&lt;hwaddr&gt;,... Set
devices for which NetworkManager shouldn t create default
wired connection (Auto eth0). NetworkManager creates a
default wired connection for any wired device that is
managed and doesn t have a connection configured. List a
device in this option to inhibit creating the default
connection for the device. When the default wired connection
is deleted or saved to a new persistent connection by a
plugin, the MAC address of the wired device is automatically
added to this list to prevent creating the default
connection for that device again. Devices are spec- ified by
their MAC addresses, in lowercase. Multiple entries are
separated by commas. Example:
no-auto-default=00:22:68:5c:5d:c4,00:1e:65:ff:aa:ee</p>

<p>wifi-wext-only=false | true This option controls
NetworkManagers interaction with wpa_sup- plicant (8). When
false (default), nl80211 supplicant driver and background
scanning are used. This enables seamless connec- tion and
roaming in RSA token-enabled Wi-Fi networks. If you
encounter any problems withnl80211(e.g. due to bad drivers),
you can switch back to wext supplicant driver by setting
this option to true. Missing option or an unrecognized value
is regarded as false.</p>

<p>[keyfile] This section contains keyfile-specific options
and thus only has effect when using keyfile plugin.</p>

<p>hostname=&lt;hostname&gt; Set a persistent hostname when
using the keyfile plugin.</p>


<p>unmanaged-devices=mac:&lt;hwaddr&gt;;mac:&lt;hwaddr&gt;;...
Set devices that should be ignored by NetworkManager when
using the keyfile plugin. Devices are specified in the
following for- mat: &quot;mac:&lt;hwaddr&gt;&quot;, where
&lt;hwaddr&gt; is MAC address of the device to be ignored,
in lowercase. Multiple entries are separated by a semicolon.
Example:
unmanaged-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1e:65:30:d1:c4</p>

<p>[ifupdown] This section contains ifupdown-specific
options and thus only has effect when using ifupdown
plugin.</p>

<p>managed=false | true Controls whether interfaces listed
in the interfaces file are managed by NetworkManager. If set
to true, then interfaces listed in /etc/network/interfaces
are managed by NetworkManager. If set to false, then any
interface listed in /etc/net- work/interfaces will be
ignored by NetworkManager. Remember that NetworkManager
controls the default route, so because the inter- face is
ignored, NetworkManager may assign the default route to some
other interface. When the option is missing, false value is
taken as default.</p>

<p>[logging] This section controls NetworkManager s
logging. Any settings here are overridden by the --log-level
and --log-domains command-line options.</p>

<p>level=&lt;level&gt; One of [ERR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG]. The
ERR level logs only criti- cal errors. WARN logs warnings
that may reflect operation. INFO logs various informational
messages that are useful for tracking state and operations.
DEBUG enables verbose logging for debugging purposes.
Subsequent levels also log all messages from earlier levels;
thus setting the log level to INFO also logs error and
warning messages.</p>

<p>domains=&lt;domain1&gt;,&lt;domain2&gt;, ... The
following log domains are available: [NONE, HW, RFKILL,
ETHER, WIFI, BT, MB, DHCP4, DHCP6, PPP, WIFI_SCAN, IP4, IP6,
AUTOIP4, DNS, VPN, SHARING, SUPPLICANT, USER_SET, SYS_SET,
SUS- PEND, CORE, DEVICE, OLPC]. When &quot;NONE&quot; is
given by itself, log- ging is disabled. MB = Mobile
Broadband, USER_SET = user set- tings operations and
communication, SYS_SET = system settings service operations,
OLPC = OLPC Mesh device operations, CORE = core daemon
operations, DEVICE = activation and general inter- face
operations.</p>
