<p>_SYSCALL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual _SYSCALL(2)</p>

<p>NAME _syscall - invoking a system call without library
support (OBSOLETE)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>A _syscall macro</p>

<p>desired system call</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The important thing to know about a system
call is its prototype. You need to know how many arguments,
their types, and the function return type. There are seven
macros that make the actual call into the system easier.
They have the form:</p>

<p>_syscallX(type,name,type1,arg1,type2,arg2,...)</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>X is 06, which are the number of arguments taken by the
system call</p>

<p>type is the return type of the system call</p>

<p>name is the name of the system call</p>

<p>typeN is the Nth arguments type</p>

<p>argN is the name of the Nth argument</p>

<p>These macros create a function called name with the
arguments you spec- ify. Once you include the _syscall() in
your source file, you call the system call by name.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/include/linux/unistd.h</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO The use of these macros is Linux-specific,
and deprecated.</p>

<p>NOTES Starting around kernel 2.6.18, the _syscall macros
were removed from header files supplied to user space. Use
syscall(2) instead. (Some architectures, notably ia64, never
provided the _syscall macros; on those architectures,
syscall(2) was always required.)</p>

<p>The _syscall() macros do not produce a prototype. You
may have to cre- ate one, especially for C++ users.</p>

<p>System calls are not required to return only positive or
negative error codes. You need to read the source to be sure
how it will return errors. Usually, it is the negative of a
standard error code, for example, -EPERM. The _syscall()
macros will return the result r of the system call when r is
non-negative, but will return -1 and set the variable errno
to -r when r is negative. For the error codes, see
errno(3).</p>

<p>When defining a system call, the argument types must be
passed by-value or by-pointer (for aggregates like
structs).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;errno.h&gt; #include
&lt;linux/unistd.h&gt; /* for _syscallX macros/related stuff
*/ #include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt; /* for struct sysinfo
*/</p>

<p>_syscall1(int, sysinfo, struct sysinfo *, info);</p>

<p>/* Note: if you copy directly from the nroff source,
remember to REMOVE the extra backslashes in the printf
statement. */</p>

<p>int main(void) { struct sysinfo s_info; int error;</p>

<p>error = sysinfo(&amp;s_info); printf(&quot;code error =
%d0, error); printf(&quot;Uptime = %lds0oad: 1 min %lu / 5
min %lu / 15 min %lu0 &quot;RAM: total %lu / free %lu /
shared %lu0 &quot;Memory in buffers = %lu0wap: total %lu /
free %lu0 &quot;Number of processes = %d0, s_info.uptime,
s_info.loads[0], s_info.loads[1], s_info.loads[2],
s_info.totalram, s_info.freeram, s_info.sharedram,
s_info.bufferram, s_info.totalswap, s_info.freeswap,
s_info.procs); exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); }</p>

<p>Sample Output code error = 0 uptime = 502034s Load: 1
min 13376 / 5 min 5504 / 15 min 1152 RAM: total 15343616 /
free 827392 / shared 8237056 Memory in buffers = 5066752
Swap: total 27881472 / free 24698880 Number of processes =
40</p>
