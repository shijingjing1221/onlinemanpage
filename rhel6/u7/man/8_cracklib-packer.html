<p>cracklib-format(8) Debian GNU/Linux manual
cracklib-format(8)</p>

<p>NAME cracklib-format, cracklib-packer, cracklib-unpacker
- cracklib dictio- nary utilities</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cracklib-format file ...</p>

<p>cracklib-packer cracklib_dictpath</p>

<p>cracklib-unpacker cracklib_dictpath</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cracklib-format takes a list of text files
each containing a list of words, one per line, It lowercases
all words, removes control charac- ters, and sorts the
lists. It outputs the cleaned up list to standard output.
The text files may be optionally compressed with
gzip(1).</p>

<p>If you supply massive amounts of text to cracklib-format
you must have enough free space available for use by the
sort(1) command. If you do not have 20Mb free in /var/tmp
(or whatever temporary area your sort(1) command uses), have
a look at the /usr/sbin/cracklib-format program which is a
sh(1) program. You can usually tweak the sort(1) command to
use any large area of disk you desire, by use of the -T
option. crack- lib-format has a hook for this.</p>

<p>cracklib-packer reads from standard input a list of
sorted and cleaned words and creates a database in the
directory and prefix given by the command line argument
cracklib_dictpath. Three files are created with the suffixes
of .hwm, .pwd, and .pwi. These three files are in the format
that the FascistCheck(3) subroutine, cracklib-unpacker(8),
and cracklib-check(8), utilities understand. The number of
words read and written are printed on stdout(3).</p>

<p>cracklib-unpacker reads from the database in the
directory and prefix given by the command line argument
cracklib_dictpath and outputs on standard output the list of
words that make up the database.</p>

<p>The database is in a binary format generated by the
utilities crack- lib-format(8) and cracklib-packer(8). On a
Debian system the database is located in the directory
/var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict and is generated daily
with the program /etc/cron.daily/cracklib. The loca- tion is
also defined in the header file crack.h using the constant
CRACKLIB_DICTPATH though none of the subroutines in the
cracklib libraries have this location hardcoded into their
implementations.</p>

<p>FILES /var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict.[hwm|pwd|pwi]
cracklib dictionary database files used by utilities.</p>

<p>/etc/cron.daily/cracklib cracklib daily cron program to
rebuild the cracklib dictionary database.</p>

<p>/etc/cracklib/cracklib.conf cracklib configuration file
used by the cracklib daily cron pro- gram to rebuild the
cracklib dictionary database.</p>

<p>/usr/include/crack.h cracklib header file defining the
subroutine FascistCheck(3) and the constant
CRACKLIB_DICTPATH used to compile in the location of the
cracklib dictionary database for these utilities.</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/cracklib-format cracklib shell script to
create initial list of words for dic- tionary database.</p>
