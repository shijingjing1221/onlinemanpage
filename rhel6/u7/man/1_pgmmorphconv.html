<p>NAME pgmmorphconv - perform morphological convolutions:
dilation, erosion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmmorphconv [ -erode | -dilate | -open |
-close ] templatefile [pgm- file]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pgmmorphconv performs morphological convolutions on a
PGM image: dila- tion and erosion.</p>

<p>pgmmorphconv performs a &quot;topological&quot;
convolution. For each pixel of the input, pgmmorphconv
generates an output pixel in the same position. To determine
the intensity of the output pixel, pgmmorphconv lays the
template image over the input image such that the middle
pixel of the template is over the input pixel in question.
pgmmorphconv looks at the input pixels underneath each white
pixel in the template. For a dilation, the maximum intensity
of all those pixels is the intensity of the output pixel.
For an erosion, it is the minimum.</p>

<p>Thus, the dilation effect is that bright areas of the
input get bigger and dark areas smaller. The erosion effect
is the opposite. The sim- plest template image would be one
with a white pixel in the middle and the rest black. This
would produce an output image identical to the input.
Another simple template image is a fully white square. This
causes bright or dark areas to expand in all directions. A
template image that is white on the left side and black on
the right would smear the image to the right.</p>

<p>The template file named by templatefile contains the
template image as a PBM image. It must have an odd number of
rows and an odd number of columns, so there is a definite
middle pixel. It must contain at least one white pixel.</p>

<p>This is similar to the continuous convolution done by
pnmconvol, except that with pnmconvol the output intensity
is a weighted average of nearby input pixels instead of a
minimum or maximum.</p>

<p>This convolution changes the three Minkowski integrals
in a predefined way, and can be used to filter an image to
enhance certain features, to ease their automatic
recognition.</p>

<p>The options -erode and -dilate obviously produce an
erosion or dila- tion, respectively.</p>

<p>The -open option causes pgmmorphconv to perform first an
erode and then a dilate operation. The -close option causes
a dilate first and then an erode. If you specify none of
these options, it is the same as -dilate.</p>
