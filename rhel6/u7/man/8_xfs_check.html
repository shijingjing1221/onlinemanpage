<p>NAME xfs_check - check XFS filesystem consistency</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfs_check [ -i ino ] ... [ -b bno ] ... [ -f ]
[ -s ] [ -v ] [ -l logdev ] device</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfs_check checks whether an XFS filesystem
is consistent. It is nor- mally run only when there is
reason to believe that the filesystem has a consistency
problem. The filesystem to be checked is specified by the
device argument, which should be the disk or volume device
for the filesystem. Filesystems stored in files can also be
checked, using the -f flag. The filesystem should normally
be unmounted or read-only dur- ing the execution of
xfs_check. Otherwise, spurious problems are reported.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -f Specifies that the filesystem image to be
processed is stored in a regular file at device (see the
mkfs.xfs(8) -d file option). This might happen if an image
copy of a filesystem has been made into an ordinary
file.</p>

<p>-l logdev Specifies the device where the filesystems
external log resides. Only for those filesystems which use
an external log. See the mkfs.xfs(8) -l option, and refer to
xfs(5) for a detailed description of the XFS log.</p>

<p>-s Specifies that only serious errors should be
reported. Serious errors are those that make it impossible
to find major data structures in the filesystem. This option
can be used to cut down the amount of output when there is a
serious problem, when the output might make it difficult to
see what the real problem is.</p>

<p>-v Specifies verbose output; it is impossibly long for a
reason- ably-sized filesystem. This option is intended for
internal use only.</p>

<p>-i ino Specifies verbose behavior for the specified
inode ino. For instance, it can be used to locate all the
blocks associated with a given inode.</p>

<p>-b bno Specifies verbose behavior for the specific
filesystem block at bno. For instance, it can be used to
determine what a specific block is used for. The block
number is a &quot;file system block num- ber&quot;.
Conversion between disk addresses (i.e. addresses reported
by xfs_bmap(8)) and file system blocks may be accom- plished
using xfs_db(8)s convert command.</p>

<p>Any output that is produced when xfs_check is not run in
verbose mode indicates that the filesystem has an
inconsistency. The filesystem can be repaired using either
xfs_repair(8) to fix the filesystem in place, or by using
xfsdump(8) and mkfs.xfs(8) to dump the filesystem, make a
new filesystem, then use xfsrestore(8) to restore the data
onto the new filesystem. Note that xfsdump may fail on a
corrupt filesystem. How- ever, if the filesystem is
mountable, xfsdump can be used to try and save important
data before repairing the filesystem with xfs_repair. If the
filesystem is not mountable though, xfs_repair is the only
viable option.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS If the filesystem is completely corrupt, a
core dump might be produced instead of the message device is
not a valid filesystem</p>

<p>If the filesystem is very large (has many files) then
xfs_check might run out of memory. In this case the message
out of memory is printed.</p>

<p>The following is a description of the most likely
problems and the associated messages. Most of the
diagnostics produced are only mean- ingful with an
understanding of the structure of the filesystem.</p>

<p>agf_freeblks n, counted m in ag a The freeblocks count
in the allocation group header for alloca- tion group a
doesn t match the number of blocks counted free.</p>

<p>agf_longest n, counted m in ag a The longest free extent
in the allocation group header for allo- cation group a
doesn t match the longest free extent found in the
allocation group.</p>

<p>agi_count n, counted m in ag a The allocated inode count
in the allocation group header for allocation group a doesn
t match the number of inodes counted in the allocation
group.</p>

<p>agi_freecount n, counted m in ag a The free inode count
in the allocation group header for alloca- tion group a
doesn t match the number of inodes counted free in the
allocation group.</p>

<p>block a/b expected inum 0 got i The block number is
specified as a pair (allocation group num- ber, block in the
allocation group). The block is used multiple times
(shared), between multiple inodes. This message usually
follows a message of the next type.</p>

<p>block a/b expected type unknown got y The block is used
multiple times (shared).</p>

<p>block a/b type unknown not expected The block is
unaccounted for (not in the freelist and not in use).</p>

<p>link count mismatch for inode nnn (name xxx), nlink m,
counted n The inode has a bad link count (number of
references in directo- ries).</p>

<p>rtblock b expected inum 0 got i The block is used
multiple times (shared), between multiple inodes. This
message usually follows a message of the next type.</p>

<p>rtblock b expected type unknown got y The real-time
block is used multiple times (shared).</p>

<p>rtblock b type unknown not expected The real-time block
is unaccounted for (not in the freelist and not in use).</p>

<p>sb_fdblocks n, counted m The number of free data blocks
recorded in the superblock doesn t match the number counted
free in the filesystem.</p>

<p>sb_frextents n, counted m The number of free real-time
extents recorded in the superblock doesn t match the number
counted free in the filesystem.</p>

<p>sb_icount n, counted m The number of allocated inodes
recorded in the superblock doesn t match the number
allocated in the filesystem.</p>

<p>sb_ifree n, counted m The number of free inodes recorded
in the superblock doesnt match the number free in the
filesystem.</p>
