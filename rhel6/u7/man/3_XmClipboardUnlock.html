(void)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmClipboardUnlock unlocks the clipboard,
enabling it to be accessed by other applications.</p>

same number of calls to XmClipboardUnlock is necessary to
unlock the clipboard, unless remove_all_locks is set to
True.</p>

that was returned in a previous call to XOpenDisplay or
XtDisplay.</p>

the applica- tion window to the clipboard. The widgets
window ID can be obtained through XtWindow. The same
application instance should pass the same window ID to each
of the clipboard func- tions that it calls.</p>

locks should be removed. When False, indicates that only one
level of lock should be removed.</p>
