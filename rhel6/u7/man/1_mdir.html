<p>mdir(1) mdir(1)</p>

<p>Name mdir - display an MSDOS directory</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mdir command is used to display an
MS-DOS directory. Its syntax is:</p>

<p>mdir [-/] [-f] [-w] [-a] [-b] msdosfile [
msdosfiles...]</p>

<p>Mdir displays the contents of MS-DOS directories, or the
entries for some MS-DOS files.</p>

<p>Mdir supports the following command line options:</p>

<p>/ Recursive output, just like Dos -s option</p>

<p>w Wide output. With this option, mdir prints the
filenames across the page without displaying the file size
or creation date.</p>

<p>a Also list hidden files.</p>

<p>f Fast. Do not try to find out free space. On larger
disks, finding out the amount of free space takes up some
non trivial amount of time, as the whole FAT must be read in
and scanned. The -f flag bypasses this step. This flag is
not needed on FAT32 filesystems, which store the size
explicitely.</p>

<p>b Concise listing. Lists each directory name or
filename, one per line (including the filename extension).
This switch displays no heading information and no summary.
Only a newline separated list of pathnames is displayed.</p>

<p>An error occurs if a component of the path is not a
directory.</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
