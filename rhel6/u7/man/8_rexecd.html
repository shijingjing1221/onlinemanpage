<p>REXECD(8) BSD System Manager s Manual REXECD(8)</p>

<p>NAME rexecd - remote execution server</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rexecd [ -D ]</p>

<p>OPTIONS Rexec accepts one option:</p>

<p>-D Disable reverse DNS look up and in the log will be
used client IP addresses.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Rexecd is the server for the rexec(3)
routine. The server provides remote execution facilities
with authentication based on user names and passwords.</p>

<p>Rexecd listens for service requests at the port
indicated in the exec service specification; see
services(5). When a service request is received the
following protocol is initiated:</p>

<p>1. The server reads characters from the socket up to a
NUL ( ) byte. The resultant string is interpreted as an
ASCII number, base 10.</p>

<p>2. If the number received in step 1 is non-zero, it is
interpreted as the port number of a secondary stream to be
used for the stderr. A second connection will be created to
the specified port on the clients machine after receiving
and authenticating the user, pass- word, and command from
the client.</p>

<p>3. A NUL terminated user name of at most 16 characters
is retrieved on the initial socket.</p>

<p>4. A NUL terminated, unencrypted password of at most 16
characters is retrieved on the initial socket.</p>

<p>5. A NUL terminated command to be passed to a shell is
retrieved on the initial socket. The length of the command
is limited by the upper bound on the size of the systems
argument list.</p>

<p>6. Rexecd then validates the user as is done at login
time and, if the authentication was successful, changes to
the user s home directory, and establishes the user and
group protections of the user. If any of these steps fail
the connection is aborted with a diagnostic mes- sage
returned.</p>

<p>7. A NUL byte is returned on the initial socket and the
command line is passed to the normal login shell of the
user. The shell inherits the network connections established
by rexecd.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Except for the last one listed below, all
diagnostic messages are returned on the initial socket,
after which any network connections are closed. An error is
indicated by a leading byte with a value of 1 (0 is returned
in step 7 above upon successful completion of all the steps
prior to the command execution).</p>

<p>username too long The name is longer than 16
characters.</p>

<p>password too long The password is longer than 16
characters.</p>

<p>command too long The command line passed exceeds the
size of the argument list (as configured into the
system).</p>

<p>Login incorrect. No password file entry for the user
name existed or the wrong password was supplied.</p>

<p>No remote directory. The chdir command to the home
directory failed.</p>

<p>Try again. A fork by the server failed.</p>

<p>&lt;shellname&gt;: ... The user s login shell could not
be started. This message is returned on the connection
associated with the stderr, and is not preceded by a flag
byte.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rexec(3)</p>

<p>BUGS A facility to allow all data and password exchanges
to be encrypted should be present.</p>

<p>HISTORY The rexecd command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>
