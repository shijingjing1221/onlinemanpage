<p>FEBOOTSTRAP-TO-INITRAMFS(8) Virtualization Support
FEBOOTSTRAP-TO-INITRAMFS(8)</p>

<p>NAME febootstrap-to-initramfs - Convert febootstrap root
to initramfs (cpio) file.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS febootstrap-to-initramfs [--files=filelist] DIR
&gt; initrd.img</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION febootstrap-to-initramfs converts the
filesystem created by febootstrap(8) into an initramfs
image. This allows the new system to be booted on real
hardware or inside a QEMU-based virtual machine.</p>

<p>An initramfs image is just a compressed cpio file, so
you could uncompress it with gunzip(1) and use cpio(1) to
convert it into other formats.</p>

<p>The permissions inside the initrd image are corrected
automatically (see the discussion of fakeroot logfile in the
febootstrap(8) page). You do not need to run this command as
root.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --files=filelist &quot;filelist&quot; should be
a file containing a list of the files to be added to the
initramfs (one per line). Only those files are added and any
others are ignored.</p>

<p>When the &quot;--files&quot; option is not given, all
files in &quot;DIR&quot; are added to the initramfs
image.</p>

<p>--nocompress This prevents the initramfs image from
being compressed.</p>

<p>Linux can boot from uncompressed initramfs images (in
fact, faster), but they take up a lot more space on
disk.</p>

<p>/init Normal initramfs images start by executing the
program or script called &quot;/init&quot;. febootstrap does
not create this script, so you may wish to, particularly for
very minimal bootstraps that don t have the normal
SysVinit/upstart machinery. It s also required if the kernel
cannot find a &quot;real&quot; root filesystem (the root
filesystem that we built and placed in an initramfs doesnt
count).</p>

<p>Linux will try to run the following commands in turn,
unless you override it using the &quot;init=cmd&quot; kernel
option:</p>

<p>&middot; /init</p>

<p>&middot; /sbin/init</p>

<p>&middot; /etc/init</p>

<p>&middot; /bin/init</p>

<p>&middot; /bin/sh</p>

<p>MEMORY REQUIREMENTS Initramfs images are uncompressed by
the kernel into memory. When booting the new system you will
need at least enough free RAM to store the uncompressed
filesystem plus extra to run any programs. Bear this in mind
when creating very large filesystems.</p>
