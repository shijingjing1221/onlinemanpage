<p>NAME fallocate - preallocate space to a file.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fallocate [-n] [-p] [-o offset] -l length
filename</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fallocate is used to preallocate blocks to a
file. For filesystems which support the fallocate system
call, this is done quickly by allo- cating blocks and
marking them as uninitialized, requiring no IO to the data
blocks. This is much faster than creating a file by filling
it with zeros.</p>

<p>As of the Linux Kernel v2.6.31, the fallocate system
call is supported by the btrfs, ext4, ocfs2, and xfs
filesystems.</p>

<p>The exit code returned by fallocate is 0 on success and
1 on failure.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Print help and exit.</p>

<p>-n, --keep-size Do not modify the apparent length of the
file. This may effec- tively allocate blocks past EOF, which
can be removed with a truncate.</p>

<p>-p, --punch-hole Punch holes in the file, the range
should not exceed the length of the file.</p>

<p>-o, --offset offset Specifies the beginning offset of
the allocation, in bytes. Suffixes of k, m, g, t, p, e may
be specified to denote KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.</p>

<p>-l, --length length Specifies the length of the
allocation, in bytes. Suffixes of k, m, g, t, p, e may be
specified to denote KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.</p>
