<p>SG_WRITE_BUFFER(8) SG3_UTILS SG_WRITE_BUFFER(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_write_buffer - send a SCSI WRITE BUFFER
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_write_buffer [--help] [--id=ID] [--in=FILE]
[--length=LEN] [--mode=MO] [--offset=OFF] [--raw]
[--skip=SKIP] [--verbose] [--ver- sion] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sends a SCSI WRITE BUFFER command to DEVICE,
along with data provided by the user. In some cases no data
is required, or data can be read from the file given in the
--in=FILE option, or data is read from stdin when either
--raw or --in=- is given.</p>

<p>Some WRITE BUFFER command variants do not have
associated data to send to the device, for example
&quot;activate_mc&quot; (&quot;activate deferred
microcode&quot;).</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit. If used
multiple times also prints the mode names and their
acronyms.</p>

<p>-i, --id=ID this option sets the buffer id field in the
cdb. ID is a value between 0 (default) and 255
inclusive.</p>

<p>-I, --in=FILE read data from file FILE that will be sent
with the WRITE BUFFER command. If FILE is - then stdin is
read until an EOF is detected (this is the same action as
--raw).</p>

<p>-l, --length=LEN where LEN is the length, in bytes, of
data to be written to the device. If not given (and length
cannot be deduced from --in=FILE or --raw) then defaults to
zero. If the option is given and the length deduced from
--in=FILE or --raw is less (or no data is provided), then
bytes of 0xff are used as fill bytes.</p>

<p>-m, --mode=MO this option sets the mode field in the
cdb. MO is a value between 0 (default) and 31 inclusive.
Alternatively an abbrevia- tion can be given. To list the
available mode abbreviations give an invalid one (e.g.
--mode=xxx) or use the -hh option.</p>

<p>-o, --offset=OFF this option sets the buffer offset
field in the cdb. OFF is a value between 0 (default) and
2**24-1 . It is a byte offset.</p>

<p>-r, --raw read data from stdin until an EOF is detected.
This data is sent with the WRITE BUFFER command to DEVICE.
The action of this option is the same as using --in=-.</p>

<p>-s, --skip=SKIP this option is only active when
--in=FILE is given and FILE is a regular file, rather than
stdin. Data is read starting at byte offset SKIP to the end
of file (or the amount given by --length=LEN). If not given
the byte offset defaults to 0 (i.e. the start of the
file).</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES If no --length=LEN is given this utility reads up
to 8 MiB of data from the given file FILE (or stdin). If a
larger amount of data is required then the --length=LEN
option should be given. The user should be aware that most
operating systems have limits on the amount of data that can
be sent with one SCSI command. In Linux this depends on the
pass through mechanism used (e.g. block SG_IO or the sg
driver) and various setting in sysfs in the linux lk 2.6
series (e.g. /sys/block/sda/queue/max_sectors_kb).</p>

<p>Downloading incorrect microcode into a device has the
ability to render that device inoperable. One would hope
that the device vendor verifies the data before activating
it. If the SCSI WRITE BUFFER command is given values in its
cdb (e.g. LEN) that are inappropriate (e.g. too large) then
the device should respond with a sense key of ILLEGAL
REQUEST and an additional sense code of INVALID FIELD in
CDB. If a WRITE BUFFER command (or a sequence of them) fails
due to device vendor verification checks then it should
respond with a sense key of ILLEGAL REQUEST and an
additional sense code of COMMAND SEQUENCE ERROR.</p>

<p>All numbers given with options are assumed to be
decimal. Alterna- tively numerical values can be given in
hexadecimal preceded by either &quot;0x&quot; or
&quot;0X&quot; (or has a trailing &quot;h&quot; or
&quot;H&quot;).</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_write_buffer is 0 when
it is successful. Other- wise see the sg3_utils(8) man
page.</p>
