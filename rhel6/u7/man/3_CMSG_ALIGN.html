<p>NAME CMSG_ALIGN, CMSG_SPACE, CMSG_NXTHDR, CMSG_FIRSTHDR
- Access ancillary data</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct cmsghdr *CMSG_FIRSTHDR(struct msghdr *msgh);
struct cmsghdr *CMSG_NXTHDR(struct msghdr *msgh, struct
cmsghdr *cmsg); size_t CMSG_ALIGN(size_t length); size_t
CMSG_SPACE(size_t length); size_t CMSG_LEN(size_t length);
unsigned char *CMSG_DATA(struct cmsghdr *cmsg);</p>

<p>struct cmsghdr { socklen_t cmsg_len; /* data byte count,
including header */ int cmsg_level; /* originating protocol
*/ int cmsg_type; /* protocol-specific type */ /* followed
by unsigned char cmsg_data[]; */ };</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These macros are used to create and access
control messages (also called ancillary data) that are not a
part of the socket payload. This control information may
include the interface the packet was received on, various
rarely used header fields, an extended error description, a
set of file descriptors or Unix credentials. For instance,
control messages can be used to send additional header
fields such as IP options. Ancillary data is sent by calling
sendmsg(2) and received by calling recvmsg(2). See their
manual pages for more information.</p>

<p>Ancillary data is a sequence of struct cmsghdr
structures with appended data. This sequence should only be
accessed using the macros described in this manual page and
never directly. See the specific protocol man pages for the
available control message types. The maximum ancillary
buffer size allowed per socket can be set using
/proc/sys/net/core/opt- mem_max; see socket(7).</p>

<p>CMSG_FIRSTHDR() returns a pointer to the first cmsghdr
in the ancillary data buffer associated with the passed
msghdr.</p>

<p>CMSG_NXTHDR() returns the next valid cmsghdr after the
passed cmsghdr. It returns NULL when there isnt enough space
left in the buffer.</p>

<p>CMSG_ALIGN(), given a length, returns it including the
required align- ment. This is a constant expression.</p>

<p>CMSG_SPACE() returns the number of bytes an ancillary
element with pay- load of the passed data length occupies.
This is a constant expres- sion.</p>

<p>CMSG_DATA() returns a pointer to the data portion of a
cmsghdr.</p>

<p>CMSG_LEN() returns the value to store in the cmsg_len
member of the cmsghdr structure, taking into account any
necessary alignment. It takes the data length as an
argument. This is a constant expression.</p>

<p>To create ancillary data, first initialize the
msg_controllen member of the msghdr with the length of the
control message buffer. Use CMSG_FIRSTHDR() on the msghdr to
get the first control message and CMSG_NEXTHDR() to get all
subsequent ones. In each control message, initialize
cmsg_len (with CMSG_LEN()), the other cmsghdr header fields,
and the data portion using CMSG_DATA(). Finally, the
msg_controllen field of the msghdr should be set to the sum
of the CMSG_SPACE() of the length of all control messages in
the buffer. For more information on the msghdr, see
recvmsg(2).</p>

<p>When the control message buffer is too short to store
all messages, the MSG_CTRUNC flag is set in the msg_flags
member of the msghdr.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This ancillary data model conforms to the
POSIX.1g draft, 4.4BSD-Lite, the IPv6 advanced API described
in RFC 2292 and the SUSv2. CMSG_ALIGN() is a Linux
extension.</p>

<p>NOTES For portability, ancillary data should be accessed
only using the macros described here. CMSG_ALIGN() is a
Linux extension and should be not used in portable
programs.</p>

<p>In Linux, CMSG_LEN(), CMSG_DATA(), and CMSG_ALIGN() are
constant expressions (assuming their argument is constant);
this could be used to declare the size of global variables.
This may be not portable, however.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE This code looks for the IP_TTL option in a
received ancillary buffer:</p>

<p>struct msghdr msgh; struct cmsghdr *cmsg; int *ttlptr;
int received_ttl;</p>

<p>/* Receive auxiliary data in msgh */ for (cmsg =
CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&amp;msgh); cmsg != NULL; cmsg =
CMSG_NXTHDR(&amp;msgh,cmsg)) { if (cmsg-&gt;cmsg_level ==
IPPROTO_IP &amp;&amp; cmsg-&gt;cmsg_type == IP_TTL) { ttlptr
= (int *) CMSG_DATA(cmsg); received_ttl = *ttlptr; break; }
} if (cmsg == NULL) { /* * Error: IP_TTL not enabled or
small buffer * or I/O error. */ }</p>

<p>The code below passes an array of file descriptors over
a Unix socket using SCM_RIGHTS:</p>

<p>struct msghdr msg = {0}; struct cmsghdr *cmsg; int
myfds[NUM_FD]; /* Contains the file descriptors to pass. */
char buf[CMSG_SPACE(sizeof myfds)]; /* ancillary data buffer
*/ int *fdptr;</p>

<p>msg.msg_control = buf; msg.msg_controllen = sizeof buf;
cmsg = CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&amp;msg); cmsg-&gt;cmsg_level =
SOL_SOCKET; cmsg-&gt;cmsg_type = SCM_RIGHTS;
cmsg-&gt;cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(sizeof(int) * NUM_FD); /*
Initialize the payload: */ fdptr = (int *) CMSG_DATA(cmsg);
memcpy(fdptr, myfds, NUM_FD * sizeof(int)); /* Sum of the
length of all control messages in the buffer: */
msg.msg_controllen = cmsg-&gt;cmsg_len;</p>
