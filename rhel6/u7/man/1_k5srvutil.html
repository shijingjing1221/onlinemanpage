<p>NAME k5srvutil - host key table (keytab) manipulation
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS k5srvutil operation [ -i ] [ -f filename ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION k5srvutil allows a system manager to list or
change keys currently in his keytab or to add new keys to
the keytab.</p>

<p>Operation must be one of the following:</p>

<p>list lists the keys in a keytab showing version number
and princi- pal name.</p>

<p>change changes all the keys in the keytab to new
randomly-generated keys, updating the keys in the Kerberos
servers database to match by using the kadmin protocol. If a
key s version num- ber doesn t match the version number
stored in the Kerberos servers database, then the operation
will fail. The old keys are retained so that existing
tickets continue to work. If the -i flag is given, k5srvutil
will prompt for yes or no before changing each key. If the
-k option is used, the old and new keys will be
displayed.</p>

<p>delold Deletes keys that are not the most recent version
from the keytab. This operation should be used some time
after a change operation to remove old keys. If the -i flag
is used, then the program prompts the user whether the old
keys associated with each principal should be removed.</p>

<p>delete deletes particular keys in the keytab,
interactively prompt- ing for each key.</p>

<p>In all cases, the default file used is /etc/krb5.keytab
file unless this is overridden by the -f option.</p>

<p>k5srvutil uses the kadmin program to edit the keytab in
place. How- ever, old keys are retained, so they are
available in case of failure.</p>
