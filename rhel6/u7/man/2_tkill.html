<p>NAME tkill, tgkill - send a signal to a thread</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int tkill(int tid, int sig);</p>

<p>int tgkill(int tgid, int tid, int sig);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tgkill() sends the signal sig to the thread
with the thread ID tid in the thread group tgid. (By
contrast, kill(2) can only be used to send a signal to a
process (i.e., thread group) as a whole, and the signal will
be delivered to an arbitrary thread within that
process.)</p>

<p>tkill() is an obsolete predecessor to tgkill(). It only
allows the target thread ID to be specified, which may
result in the wrong thread being signaled if a thread
terminates and its thread ID is recycled. Avoid using this
system call.</p>

<p>If tgid is specified as -1, tgkill() is equivalent to
tkill().</p>

<p>These are the raw system call interfaces, meant for
internal thread library use.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EINVAL An invalid thread ID, thread group ID, or
signal was specified.</p>

<p>EPERM Permission denied. For the required permissions,
see kill(2).</p>

<p>ESRCH No process with the specified thread ID (and
thread group ID) exists.</p>

<p>VERSIONS tkill() is supported since Linux 2.4.19 /
2.5.4. tgkill() was added in Linux 2.5.75.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO tkill() and tgkill() are Linux-specific
and should not be used in pro- grams that are intended to be
portable.</p>

<p>NOTES See the description of CLONE_THREAD in clone(2)
for an explanation of thread groups.</p>

<p>Glibc does not provide wrappers for these system calls;
call them using syscall(2).</p>
