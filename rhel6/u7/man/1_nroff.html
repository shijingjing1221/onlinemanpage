<p>NAME nroff - emulate nroff command with groff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nroff [ -h ] [ -i ] [ -mname ] [ -nnum ] [
-olist ] [ -p ] [ -rcn ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [ -Tname ] [ -U ] [
-v ] [ file ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nroff script emulates the nroff command
using groff. Only ascii, ascii8, latin1, utf8, nippon, and
cp1047 are valid arguments for the -T option. If an invalid
or no -T option is given, nroff checks the cur- rent locale
to select a default output device. It first tries the locale
program, then the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
and LANG, and finally the LESSCHARSET environment
variable.</p>

<p>The -h and -c options are equivalent to grottys options
-h (using tabs in the output) and -c (using the old output
scheme instead of SGR escape sequences). The -C, -i, -n, -m,
-o, and -r options have the effect described in troff(1). In
addition, nroff silently ignores the options -e, -q, and -s
(which are not implemented in troff). Options -p (pic), -t
(tbl), -S (safer), and -U (unsafe) are passed to groff. -v
shows the version number.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT GROFF_BIN_PATH A colon separated list of
directories in which to search for the groff executable
before searching in PATH. If unset, /usr/bin is used.</p>

<p>NOTES This shell script is basically intended for use
with man(1), so warn- ings are suppressed. nroff-style
character definitions (in the file tty-char.tmac) are also
loaded to emulate unrepresentable glyphs.</p>
