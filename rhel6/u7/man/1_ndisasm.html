<p>NAME ndisasm - the Netwide Disassembler, an 80x86 binary
file disassembler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ndisasm [ -o origin ] [ -s sync-point [...]] [
-a | -i ] [ -b bits ] [ -u ] [ -e hdrlen ] [ -k
offset,length [...]] infile ndisasm -h ndisasm -r</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ndisasm command generates a disassembly
listing of the binary file infile and directs it to
stdout.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h Causes ndisasm to exit immediately, after
giving a summary of its invocation options.</p>

<p>-r Causes ndisasm to exit immediately, after displaying
its version number.</p>

<p>-o origin Specifies the notional load address for the
file. This option causes ndisasm to get the addresses it
lists down the left hand margin, and the target addresses of
PC-relative jumps and calls, right.</p>

<p>-s sync-point Manually specifies a synchronisation
address, such that ndisasm will not output any machine
instruction which encompasses bytes on both sides of the
address. Hence the instruction which starts at that address
will be correctly disassembled.</p>

<p>-e hdrlen Specifies a number of bytes to discard from
the beginning of the file before starting disassembly. This
does not count towards the calculation of the disassembly
offset: the first disassem- bled instruction will be shown
starting at the given load address.</p>

<p>-k offset,length Specifies that length bytes, starting
from disassembly offset offset, should be skipped over
without generating any output. The skipped bytes still count
towards the calculation of the disassembly offset.</p>

<p>-a or -i Enables automatic (or intelligent) sync mode,
in which ndisasm will attempt to guess where synchronisation
should be performed, by means of examining the target
addresses of the relative jumps and calls it
disassembles.</p>

<p>-b bits Specifies 16-, 32- or 64-bit mode. The default
is 16-bit mode.</p>

<p>-u Specifies 32-bit mode, more compactly than using -b
32.</p>

<p>-p vendor Prefers instructions as defined by vendor in
case of a conflict. Known vendor names include intel, amd,
cyrix, and idt. The default is intel.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS ndisasm only disassembles binary files: it
has no understanding of the header information present in
object or executable files. If you want to disassemble an
object file, you should probably be using objdump(1).</p>

<p>Auto-sync mode won t necessarily cure all your
synchronisation prob- lems: a sync marker can only be placed
automatically if a jump or call instruction is found to
refer to it before ndisasm actually disassem- bles that part
of the code. Also, if spurious jumps or calls result from
disassembling non-machine-code data, sync markers may get
placed in strange places. Feel free to turn auto-sync off
and go back to doing it manually if necessary.</p>
