<p>GROFF_MM(7) GROFF_MM(7)</p>

<p>NAME groff_mm - groff mm macros</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -mm [ options... ] [ files... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The groff mm macros are intended to be
compatible with the DWB mm macros with the following
limitations:</p>

<p>&middot; no Bell Labs localisms implemented.</p>

<p>&middot; the macros OK and PM are not implemented.</p>

<p>&middot; groff mm does not support cut marks</p>

<p>mm is intended to be international. Therefore it is
possible to write short national macrofiles which change all
english text to the pre- ferred language. Use mmse as an
example.</p>

<p>A file called locale or lang_locale is read after the
initiation of the global variables. It is therefore possible
to localize the macros with companyname and so on.</p>

<p>In this manual square brackets is used to show optional
arguments.</p>

<p>Number registers and strings Many macros can be
controlled by number registers and strings. A num- ber
register is assigned with the nr command: .nr XXX [+-]n [i]
XXX is the name of the register, n is the value to be
assigned, and i is increment value for auto-increment. n can
have a plus or minus sign as prefix if an increment or
decrement of the current value is wanted. (Auto-increment or
decrement occurs if the number register is used with a plus
or minus sign,n+[XXX] orn-[XXX].)</p>

<p>Strings is defined with ds. .ds YYY string The string is
assigned everything to the end of the line, even blanks.
Initial blanks in string should be prefixed with a
double-quote. (Strings are used in the text as*[YYY].)</p>

<p>Special formatting of number registers A number register
is printed with normal digits if no format has been given.
Set the format with af: .af R c R is the name of the
register, c is the format. Form Sequence 1 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
001 000, 001, 002, 003, ... i 0, i, ii, iii, iv, ... I 0, I,
II, III, IV, ... a 0, a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ... A 0, A,
B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...</p>

<p>Macros:</p>

<p>)E level text Adds text (heading-text) to the table of
contents with level either 0 or between 1-7. See also .H.
This macro is used for customized table of contents.</p>

<p>1C [1] Begin one column processing. An 1 as argument
disables the page-break. Use wide footnotes, small footnotes
may be over- printed.</p>

<p>2C Begin two column processing. Splits the page in two
columns. It is a special case of MC. See also 1C.</p>

<p>AE Abstract end, see AS.</p>

<p>AF [name of firm] Authors firm, should be called before
AU, see also COVER.</p>

<p>AL [type [text-indent [1]]] Start autoincrement list.
Items are numbered beginning on one. The type argument
controls the type of numbers. Arg Description 1 Arabic (the
default) A Upper-case letters (A-Z) a Lower-case letters
(a-z) I Upper-case roman i Lower-case roman Text-indent sets
the indent and overrides Li. A third argument will prohibit
printing of a blank line before each item.</p>

<p>APP name text Begin an appendix with name name.
Automatic naming occurs if name is &quot;&quot;. The
appendixes starts with A if auto is used. An new page is
ejected, and a header is also produced if the number
variable Aph is non-zero. This is the default. The appendix
always appear in the List of contents with correct
pagenumber. The name APPENDIX can be changed by setting the
string App to the desired text. The string Apptxt contains
the current appendix text.</p>

<p>APPSK name pages text Same as .APP, but the pagenr is
incremented with pages. This is used when diagrams or other
non-formatted documents are included as appendixes.</p>

<p>AS [arg [indent]] Abstract start. Indent is specified in
ens , but scaling is allowed. Argument arg controls where
the abstract is printed. Arg Placement 0 Abstract will be
printed on page 1 and on the cover sheet if used in the
released-paper style (MT 4), otherwise it will be printed on
page 1 without a cover sheet. 1 Abstract will only be
printed on the cover sheet (MT 4 only). 2 Abstract will be
printed only on the cover sheet (other than MT 4 only). The
cover sheet is printed without need for CS. Abstract is not
printed at all in external letters (MT 5). The indent
controls the indentation of both margins, otherwise will
normal text indent be used.</p>

<p>AST [title] Abstract title. Default is ABSTRACT. Sets
the text above the abstract text.</p>

<p>AT title1 [title2 ...] Authors title. AT must appear
just after each AU. The title will show up after the name in
the signature block.</p>

<p>AU [name [initials [loc [dept [ext [room [arg [arg
[arg]]]]]]]]] Author information, specifies the author of
the memo or paper, and will be printed on the cover sheet
and on other similar places. AU must not appear before TL.
The author information can contain initials, location,
department, telephone extension, room number or name and up
to three extra arguments.</p>

<p>AV [name [1]] Approval signature, generates an approval
line with place for signature and date. The string APPROVED:
can be changed with variable Letapp, and the string Date in
Letdate.</p>

<p>AVL [name] Letter signature, generates a line with place
for signature.</p>

<p>B [bold-text [prev-font-text [bold...]]] Begin boldface.
No limit on the number of arguments. All argu- ments will be
concatenated to one word, the first, third and so on will be
printed in boldface.</p>

<p>B1 Begin box (as the ms macro). Draws a box around the
text. The text will be indented one character, and the right
margin will be one character shorter.</p>

<p>B2 End box. Finish the box started by B1.</p>

<p>BE End bottom block, see BS.</p>

<p>BI [bold-text [italic-text [bold-text [...]]]]
Bold-italic. No limit on the number of arguments, see B.</p>

<p>BL [text-indent [1]] Start bullet list, initialize a
list with a bullet and a space in the beginning of each list
item (see LI). Text-indent over- rides the default
indentation of the list items set by number register Pi. A
third argument will prohibit printing of a blank line before
each item.</p>

<p>BR [bold-text [roman-text [bold-text [...]]]]
Bold-roman. No limit on the number of arguments.</p>

<p>BS Bottom block start. Begins the definition of a text
block which is printed at the bottom of each page. Block
ends with BE.</p>

<p>BVL text-indent [mark-indent [1]] Start of broken
variable-item list. Broken variable-item list has no fixed
mark, it assumes that every LI has a mark instead. The text
will always begin at the next line after the mark.
Text-indent sets the indent to the text, and mark-indent the
distance from the current indent to the mark. A third
argument will prohibit printing of a blank line before each
item.</p>

<p>COVER [arg] COVER begins a coversheet definition. It is
important that .COVER appears before any normal text. .COVER
uses arg to build the filename
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/mm/arg.cov. There- fore it is
possible to create unlimited types of coversheets. ms.cov is
supposed to look like the ms coversheet. .COVER requires a
.COVEND at the end of the coverdefinition. Always use this
order of the covermacros: .COVER .TL .AF .AU .AT .AS .AE
.COVEND However, only .TL and .AU are required.</p>

<p>COVEND This finish the cover description and prints the
cover-page. It is defined in the cover file.</p>

<p>DE Display end. Ends a block of text, display, that
begins with DS or DF.</p>

<p>DF [format [fill [rindent]]] Begin floating display (no
nesting allowed). A floating display is saved in a queue and
is printed in the order entered. For- mat, fill and rindent
is the same as in DS. Floating displays are controlled by
the two number registers De and Df.</p>

<p>De register 0 Nothing special, this is the default. 1 A
page eject will occur after each printed display, giving
only one display per page and no text following it.</p>

<p>Df register 0 Displays are printed at the end of each
section (when sec- tion-page numbering is active) or at the
end of the docu- ment. 1 A new display will be printed on
the current page if there is enough space, otherwise it will
be printed at the end of the document. 2 One display will be
printed at the top of each page or col- umn (in multi-column
mode). 3 Print one display if there is enough space for it,
other- wise it will be printed at the top of the next page
or col- umn. 4 Print as many displays that will fit in a new
page or col- umn. A page break will occur between each
display if De is not zero. 5 Fill the current page with
displays and the rest beginning at a new page or column.
(This is the default.) A page break will occur between each
display if De is not zero.</p>

<p>DL [text-indent [1 [1]]] Dash list start. Begins a list
where each item is printed after a dash. Text-indent changes
the default indentation of the list items set by number
register Pi. A second argument prevents the empty line
between each list item to be printed. See LI. A third
argument will prohibit printing of a blank line before each
item.</p>

<p>DS [format [fill [rindent]]] Static display start.
Begins collection of text until DE. The text is printed
together on the same page, unless it is longer than the
height of the page. DS can be nested to a unlimited depth
(reasonably :-).</p>

<p>format &quot;&quot; No indentation. none No indentation.
L No indentation. I Indent text with the value of number
register Si. C Center each line CB Center the whole display
as a block. R Right adjust the lines. RB Right adjust the
whole display as a block</p>

<p>L, I, C and CB can also be specified as 0, 1, 2 or 3 for
compat- ibility reasons. (Dont use it. :-)</p>

<p>fill &quot;&quot; Line-filling turned off. none
Line-filling turned off. N Line-filling turned off. F
Line-filling turned on.</p>

<p>N and F can also be specified as 0 or 1. An empty line
will normally be printed before and after the display.
Setting number register Ds to 0 will prevent this. Rindent
shortens the line length by that amount.</p>

<p>EC [title [override [flag [refname]]]] Equation title.
Sets a title for an equation. The override argument change
the numbering.</p>

<p>flag none override is a prefix to the number. 0 override
is a prefix to the number. 1 override is a suffix to the
number. 2 override replaces the number. EC uses the number
register Ec as counter. It is possible to use .af to change
the format of the number. If number register Of is 1, then
the format of title will use a dash instead of a dot after
the number. The string Le controls the title of the List of
Equations, default is LIST OF EQUATIONS. The List of
Equations will only be printed if number register Le is 1,
default 0. The string Liec contains the word Equation, wich
is printed before the num- ber. If refname is used, then the
equation number is saved with .SETR, and can be retrieved
with .GETST refname. Special handling of the title will
occur if EC is used inside DS/DE, it will not be affected by
the format of DS.</p>

<p>EF [arg] Even-page footer, printed just above the normal
page footer on even pages, see PF.</p>

<p>EH [arg] Even-page header, printed just below the normal
page header on even pages, see PH.</p>

<p>EN Equation end, see EQ.</p>

<p>EOP End of page user-defined macro. This macro will be
called instead of the normal printing of the footer. The
macro will be executed in a separate environment, without
any trap active. See TP.</p>

<p>Strings available to EOP EOPf Argument from PF.
EOPefArgument from EF. EOPofArgument from OF.</p>

<p>EPIC [-L] width height [name] EPIC draws a box with the
given width and height, it will also print the text name or
a default string if name is not speci- fied.. This is used
to include external pictures, just give the size of the
picture. -L will leftadjust the picture, the default is to
center adjust. See PIC</p>

<p>EQ [label] Equation start. EQ/EN are the delimiters for
equations written for eqn. EQ/EN must be inside a
DS/DE-pair, except when EQ is only used to set options in
eqn. The label will appear at the right margin of the
equation, unless number register Eq is 1. Then the label
will appear at the left margin.</p>

<p>EX [title [override [flag [refname]]]] Exhibit title,
arguments are the same as for EC. EX uses the number
register Ex as counter. The string Lx controls the title of
the List of Exhibits, default is LIST OF EXHIBITS. The List
of Exhibits will only be printed if number register Lx is 1,
default 1. The string Liex contains the word Exhibit, which
is printed before the number. If refname is used, then the
exhibit number is saved with .SETR, and can be retrieved
with .GETST refname. Special handling of the title will
occur if EX is used inside DS/DE, it will not be affected by
the format of DS.</p>

<p>FC [closing] Prints Yours very truly, as a formal
closing of a letter or mem- orandum. The argument replaces
the defualt string. The default is stored in string variable
Letfc.</p>

<p>FD [arg [1]] Footnote default format. Controls the
hyphenation (hyphen), right margin justification (adjust),
indentation of footnote text (indent). It can also change
the label justification (ljust).</p>

<p>arg hyphen adjust indent ljust 0 no yes yes left 1 yes
yes yes left 2 no no yes left 3 yes no yes left 4 no yes no
left 5 yes yes no left 6 no no no left 7 yes no no left 8 no
yes yes right 9 yes yes yes right 10 no no yes right 11 yes
no yes right</p>

<p>Argument greater than or equal to 11 is considered as
arg 0. Default for mm is 10.</p>

<p>FE Footnote end.</p>

<p>FG [title [override [flag [refname]]]] Figure title,
arguments are the same as for EC. FG uses the number
register Fg as counter. The string Lf controls the title of
the List of Figures, default is LIST OF FIGURES. The List of
Figures will only be printed if number register Lf is 1,
default 1. The string Lifg contains the word Figure, wich is
printed before the number. If refname is used, then the
figure number is saved with .SETR, and can be retrieved with
.GETST refname. Special handling of the title will occur if
FG is used inside DS/DE, it will not be affected by the
format of DS.</p>

<p>FS [label] Footnote start. The footnote is ended by FE.
Footnotes is nor- mally automatically numbered, the number
is available in string F. Just add*F in the text. By adding
label, it is possible to have other number or names on the
footnotes. Footnotes in displays is now possible. An empty
line separates footnotes, the height of the line is
controlled by number register Fs, default value is 1.</p>

<p>GETHN refname [varname] Includes the headernumber where
the corresponding SETR refname was placed. Will be X.X.X. in
pass 1. See INITR. If varname is used, GETHN sets the
stringvariable varname to the headernum- ber.</p>

<p>GETPN refname [varname] Includes the pagenumber where
the corresponding SETR refname was placed. Will be 9999 in
pass 1. See INITR. If varname is used, GETPN sets the
stringvariable varname to the pagenumber.</p>

<p>GETR refname Combines GETHN and GETPN with the text
chapter and , page. The string Qrf contains the text for
reference: .ds Qrf See chapter \*[Qrfh], page \*[Qrfp]. Qrf
may be changed to support other languages. Strings Qrfh and
Qrfp are set by GETR and contains the page and
headernumber.</p>

<p>GETST refname [varname] Includes the string saved with
the second argument to .SETR. Will be dummystring in pass 1.
If varname is used, GETST sets the stringvariable varname to
the saved string. See INITR.</p>

<p>H level [heading-text [heading-suffix]] Numbered section
heading. Section headers can have a level between 1 and 7,
level 1 is the top level. The text is given in heading-text,
and must be surrounded by double quotes if it con- tains
spaces. Heading-suffix is added to the header in the text
but not in the table of contents. This is normally used for
footnote marks and similar things. Dont use*F in heading-
suffix, it wont work. A manual label must be used, see
FS.</p>

<p>An eventual paragraph, P, directly after H will be
ignored, H is taking care of spacing and indentation.</p>

<p>Page ejection before heading Number register Ej controls
page ejection before the heading. Normally, a level one
heading gets two blank lines before it, higher levels gets
only one. A new page is ejected before each first-level
heading if number register Ej is 1. All levels below or
equal the value of Ej gets a new page. Default value for Ej
is 0.</p>

<p>Heading break level A line break occurs after the
heading if the heading level is less or equal to number
register Hb. Default value 2.</p>

<p>Heading space level A blank line is inserted after the
heading if the heading level is less or equal to number
register Hs. Default value 2.</p>

<p>Text will follow the heading on the same line if the
level is greater than both Hb and Hs.</p>

<p>Post-heading indent Indentation of the text after the
heading is controlled by num- ber register Hi, default value
0.</p>

<p>Hi 0 The text will be left-justified. 1 Indentation of
the text will follow the value of number register Pt, see P.
2 The text will be lined up with the first word of the head-
ing.</p>

<p>Centered section headings All headings whose level is
equal or below number register Hc and also less than or
equal to Hb or Hs is centerered.</p>

<p>Font control of the heading The font of each heading
level is controlled by string HF. It contains a fontnumber
or fontname for each level. Default is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (all
headings in italic). Could also be written as I I I I I I I.
Note that some other implementations use 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 as
the default value. All omitted values are pre- sumed to be a
1.</p>

<p>Point size control. String HP controls the pointsize of
each heading, in the same way as HF controls the font. A
value of 0 selects the default point size. Default value is
0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Beware that only the point size changes, not
the vertical size. That can be con- trolled by the user
specified macro HX and/or HZ.</p>

<p>Heading counters Seven number registers, named H1 thru
H7 contains the counter for each heading level. The values
are printed using arabic numerals, this can be changed with
the macro HM (see below). All marks are concatenated before
printing. To avoid this, set number register Ht to 1. That
will only print the current head- ing counter at each
heading.</p>

<p>Automatic table of contents All headings whose level is
equal or below number register Cl is saved to be printed in
the table of contents. Default value is 2.</p>

<p>Special control of the heading, user-defined macros.
These macros can be defined by the user to get a finer
control of vertical spacing, fonts or other features.
Argument level is the level-argument to H, but 0 for
unnumbered headings (see HU). Argument rlevel is the real
level, it is set to number register Hu for unnumbered
headings. Argument heading-text is the text argument to H
and HU.</p>

<p>HX level rlevel heading-text HX is called just before
the printing of the heading. The fol- lowing register is
available for HX. HX may alter }0, }2 and ;3. string }0
Contains the heading mark plus two spaces if rlevel is non-
zero, otherwise empty. register ;0 Contains the position of
the text after the heading. 0 means that the text should
follow the heading on the same line, 1 means that a line
break should occur before the text and 2 means that a blank
line should separate the heading and the text. string }2
Contains two spaces if register ;0 is 0. It is used to
separate the heading from the text. The string is empty if
;0 is non-zero. register ;3 Contains the needed space in
units after the heading. Default is 2v.</p>

<p>Can be used to change things like numbering (}0),
vertical spacing (}2) and the needed space after the
heading.</p>

<p>HY dlevel rlevel heading-text HY is called after size
and font calculations and might be used to change
indentation.</p>

<p>HZ dlevel rlevel heading-text HZ is called after the
printing of the heading, just before H or HU exits. Could be
used to change the page header according to the section
heading.</p>

<p>HC [hyphenation-character] Set hyphenation character.
Default value is . Resets to the default if called without
argument. Hyphenation can be turned off by setting number
register Hy to 0 in the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>HM [arg1 [arg2 [... [arg7]]]] Heading mark style.
Controls the type of marking for printing of the heading
counters. Default is 1 for all levels.</p>

<p>Argument 1 Arabic numerals. 0001 Arabic numerals with
leading zeroes, one or more. A Upper-case alphabetic a
Lower-case alphabetic I Upper-case roman numerals i
lower-case roman numerals emptyArabic numerals.</p>

<p>HU heading-text Unnumbered section header. HU behavies
like H at the level in number register Hu. See H.</p>

<p>HX dlevel rlevel heading-text Userdefined heading exit.
Called just before printing the header. See H.</p>

<p>HY dlevel rlevel heading-text Userdefined heading exit.
Called just before printing the header. See H.</p>

<p>HZ dlevel rlevel heading-text Userdefined heading exit.
Called just after printing the header. See H.</p>

<p>I [italic-text [prev-font-text [italic-text [...]]]]
Italic. Changes the font to italic if called without
arguments. With one argument it will set the word in italic.
With two argument it will concatenate them and set the first
word in italic and the second in the previous font. There is
no limit on the number of argument, all will be
concatenated.</p>

<p>IA [addressee-name [title]] Begins specification of the
addressee and addressee s address in letter style. Several
names can be specified with empty IA/IE- pairs, but only one
address. See LT.</p>

<p>IB [italic-text [bold-text [italic-text [...]]]]
Italic-bold. Even arguments is printed in italic, odd in
bold- face. See I.</p>

<p>IE Ends the address-specification after IA.</p>

<p>INITI type filename [macro] Initialize the new index
system, sets the filename to collect index lines in with
IND. Argument type selects the type of index, page number,
header marks or both. The default is N.</p>

<p>It is also possible to create a macro that is
responsible for formatting each row. Add the name of the
macro as argument 3. The macro will be called with the index
as argument(s).</p>

<p>type N Page numbers H Header marks B Both page numbers
and header marks, tab separated</p>

<p>INITR filename Initialize the refencemacros. References
will be written to stderr and is supposed to be written to
filename.qrf. Requires two passes with groff, this is
handled by a separate program called mmroff, the reason is
that groff is often installed with- out the unsafe
operations that INITR requiered. The first pass looks for
references and the second one includes them. INITR can be
used several times, but it is only the first occurrence of
INITR that is active.</p>

<p>See also SETR, GETPN and GETHN.</p>

<p>IND arg1 [arg2 [...]] IND writes a line in the index
file selected by INITI with all arguments and the page
number or header mark separated by tabs. Examples arg1page
number arg1arg2page number arg1header mark arg1page
numberheader mark</p>

<p>INDP INDP prints the index by running the command
specified by string variable Indcmd, normally sort -tt. INDP
reads the output from the command to form the index,
normally in two columns (can be changed by defining TYIND).
The index is printed with string variable Index as header,
default is INDEX. One-column process- ing is returned after
the list. INDP will call the user-defined macros TXIND,
TYIND and TZIND if defined. TXIND is called before printing
INDEX, TYIND is called instead of printing INDEX. TZIND is
called after the printing and should take care of restoring
to normal operation again.</p>

<p>ISODATE [0] ISODATE changes the predefined date string
in DT to ISO-format, ie YYYY-MM-DD. This can also be done by
adding -rIso=1 on the command line. Reverts to old date
format if argument is 0.</p>

<p>IR [italic-text [roman-text [italic-text [...]]]]
Italic-roman. Even arguments is printed in italic, odd in
roman. See I.</p>

<p>LB text-indent mark-indent pad type [mark [LI-space
[LB-space]]] List begin macro. This is the common macro used
for all lists. Text-indent is the number of spaces to indent
the text from the current indent.</p>

<p>Pad and mark-indent controls where to put the mark. The
mark is placed within the mark area, and mark-indent sets
the number of spaces before this area. It is normally 0. The
mark area ends where the text begins. The start of the text
is still con- trolled by text-indent.</p>

<p>The mark is left justified whitin the mark area if pad
is 0. If pad is greater than 0, then mark-indent is ignored,
and the mark is placed pad spaces before the text. This will
right justify the mark.</p>

<p>If type is 0 the list will have either a hanging indent
or, if argument mark is given, the string mark as mark.</p>

<p>If type is greater than 0 automatic numbering will
occur, arabic if mark is empty. Mark can then be any of 1,
A, a, I or i.</p>

<p>Type selects one of six possible ways to display the
mark. type 1 x. 2 x) 3 (x) 4 [x] 5 &lt;x&gt; 6 {x}</p>

<p>Every item in the list will get LI-space number of blank
lines before them. Default is 1.</p>

<p>LB itself will print LB-space blank lines. Default is
0.</p>

<p>LC [list-level] List-status clear. Terminates all
current active lists down to list-level, or 0 if no argmuent
is given. This is used by H to clear any active list.</p>

<p>LE [1] List end. Terminate the current list. LE outputs
a blank line if an argument is given.</p>

<p>LI [mark [1]] List item precedes every item in a list.
Without argument LI will print the mark determined by the
current list type. By giving LI one argument, it will use
that as the mark instead. Two arguments to LI will make mark
a prefix to the current mark. There will be no separating
space between the prefix and the mark if the second argument
is 2 instead of 1. This behaviour can also be achieved by
setting number register Limsp to zero. A zero length mark
will make a hanging indent instead.</p>

<p>A blank line is normally printed before the list item.
This behaviour can be controlled by number register Ls.
Pre-spacing will occur for each list-level less than or
equal to Ls. Default value is 99. (Nesting of lists is
unlimited. :-)</p>

<p>The indentation can be changed thru number register Li.
Default is 6.</p>

<p>All lists begins with a list initialization macro, LB.
There are, however, seven predefined listtypes to make lists
easier to use. They all call LB with different default
values. AL Automatically Incremented List ML Marked List VL
Variable-Item List BL Bullet List DL Dash List RL Reference
List BVL Broken Varable List. These lists are described at
other places in this manual. See also LB.</p>

<p>LT [arg] Formats a letter in one of four different
styles depending on the argument. See also INTERNALS. Arg
Style BL Blocked. Date line, return address, writer s
address and closing begins at the center of the line. All
other lines begin at the left margin. SB Semi-blocked. Same
as blocked, except that the first line in every paragraph is
indented five spaces. FB Full-blocked. All lines begin at
the left margin. SP Simplified. Almost the same as the
full-blocked style. Subject and the writer s identification
are printed in all- capital.</p>

<p>LO type [arg] Specify options in letter (see .LT). This
is a list of the standard options: CN Confidential notation.
Prints CONFIDENTIAL on the second line below the date line.
Any argument replaces CONFIDEN- TIAL. See also string
variable LetCN. RN Reference notation. Prints In reference
to: and the argu- ment two lines below the date line. See
also string vari- able LetRN. AT Attention. Prints
ATTENTION: and the argument below the inside address. See
also string variable LetAT. SA Salutation. Prints To Whom It
May Concern: or the argument if it was present. The
salutation is printed two lines below the inside address.
See also string variable LetSA. SJ Subject line. Prints the
argument as subject prefixed with SUBJECT: two lines below
the inside address, except in let- ter type SP. Then the
subject is printed in all-captial without any prefix. See
also string variable LetSJ.</p>

<p>MC column-size [column-separation] Begin multiple
columns. Return to normal with 1C. MC will cre- ate as many
columns as the current line length permits. Column- size is
the width of each column, and column-separation is the space
between two columns. Default separation is the column-
size/15. See also 1C.</p>

<p>ML mark [text-indent [1]] Marked list start. The mark
argument will be printed before each list item. Text-indent
sets the indent and overrides Li. A third argument will
prohibit printing of a blank line before each item.</p>

<p>MT [arg [addressee]] Memorandum type. The arg is part of
a filename in /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac/mm/*.MT.
Memorandum type 0 thru 5 are supported, including
&quot;string&quot;. Addressee just sets a variable, used in
the AT&amp;T macros. arg 0 Normal memorandum, no type
printed 1 Memorandum with MEMORANDUM FOR FILE printed 2
Memorandum with PROGRAMMERS NOTES printed 3 Memorandum with
ENGINEERS NOTES printed 4 Released paper style 5 External
letter style See also COVER/COVEND, a more flexible type of
front page.</p>

<p>MOVE y-pos [x-pos [line-length]] Move to a position,
pageoffset set to x-pos. If line-length is not given, the
difference between current and new pageoffset is used. Use
PGFORM without arguments to return to normal.</p>

<p>MULB cw1 space1 [cw2 space2 [cw3 ...]] Begin a special
multi-column mode. Every columns width must be specified.
Also the space between the columns must be speci- fied. The
last column does not need any space-definition. MULB starts
a diversion and MULE ends the diversion and prints the
columns. The unit for width and space is n , but MULB
accepts all normal unitspecifications like c and i. MULB
operates in a separate environment.</p>

<p>MULN Begin the next column. This is the only way to
switch column.</p>

<p>MULE End the multi-column mode and print the
columns.</p>

<p>nP [type] Print numbered paragraph with header level
two. See .P.</p>

<p>NCOL Force printing to the next column, dont use this
together with the MUL* macros, see 2C.</p>

<p>NS [arg [1]] Prints different types of notations. The
argument selects between the predefined type of notations.
If the second argu- ment is available, then the argument
becomes the entire nota- tion. If the argument doesn t exist
in the predefined, it will be printed as Copy (arg) to. It
is possible to add more stan- dard notations, see the string
variable Letns and Letnsdef. Arg Notation none Copy To
&quot;&quot; Copy To 1 Copy To (with att.) to 2 Copy To
(without att.) to 3 Att. 4 Atts. 5 Enc. 6 Encs. 7 Under
separate cover 8 Letter to 9 Memorandum to 10 Copy (with
atts.) to 11 Copy (without atts.) to 12 Abstract Only to 13
Complete Memorandum to 14 CC</p>

<p>ND new-date New date. Override the current date. Date is
not printed if new-date is an empty string.</p>

<p>OF [arg] Odd-page footer, a line printed just above the
normal footer. See EF and PF.</p>

<p>OH [arg] Odd-page header, a line printed just below the
normal header. See EH and PH.</p>

<p>OP Make sure that the following text is printed at the
top of an odd-numbered page. Will not output an empty page
if currently at the top of an odd page.</p>

<p>P [type] Begin new paragraph. P without argument will
produce left jus- tified text, even the first line of the
paragraph. This is the same as setting type to 0. If the
argument is 1, then the first line of text following P will
be indented by the number of spaces in number register Pi,
normally 5.</p>

<p>Instead of giving 1 as argument to P it is possible to
set the paragraph type in number register Pt. Using 0 and 1
will be the same as adding that value to P. A value of 2
will indent all paragraphs, except after headings, lists and
displays.</p>

<p>The space between two paragraphs is controlled by number
regis- ter Ps, and is 1 by default (one blank line).</p>

<p>PGFORM [linelength [pagelength [pageoffset [1]]]] Sets
linelength, pagelength and/or pageoffset. This macro can be
used for special formatting, like letterheads and other. It
is normally the first command in a file, though its not
neces- sary. PGFORM can be used without arguments to reset
everything after a MOVE. A line-break is done unless the
fourth argument is given. This can be used to avoid the
pagenumber on the first page while setting new width and
length. (It seems as if this macro sometimes doesnt work too
well. Use the command line arguments to change linelength,
pagelength and pageoffset instead. Sorry.)</p>

<p>PGNH No header is printed on the next page. Used to get
rid of the header in letters or other special texts. This
macro must be used before any text to inhibit the pageheader
on the first page.</p>

<p>PIC [-L] [-C] [-R] [-I n] filename [width [height]] PIC
includes a Postscript file in the document. The macro
depends on mmroff and INITR. -L, -C, -R and -I n adjusts the
picture or indents it. The optionally width and height can
also be given to resize the picture.</p>

<p>PE Picture end. Ends a picture for pic, see the manual
for pic.</p>

<p>PF [arg] Page footer. PF sets the line to be printed at
the bottom of each page. Normally empty. See PH for the
argument specifica- tion.</p>

<p>PH [arg] Page header, a line printed at the top of each
page. The argu- ment should be specified as &quot; left-part
center-partright- part &quot;, where left-, center- and
right-part is printed left-jus- tified, centered and right
justified. The character % is changed to the current page
number. The default page-header is &quot;- % -&quot;, the
page number between two dashes.</p>

<p>PS Picture start (from pic). Begins a picture for pic,
see the manual.</p>

<p>PX Page-header user-defined exit. PX is called just
after the printing of the page header in no-space mode.</p>

<p>R Roman. Return to roman font, see also I.</p>

<p>RB [roman-text [bold-text [roman-text [...]]]]
Roman-bold. Even arguments is printed in roman, odd in bold-
face. See I.</p>

<p>RD [prompt [diversion [string]]] Read from standard
input to diversion and/or string. The text will be saved in
a diversion named diversion. Recall the text by writing the
name of the diversion after a dot on an empty line. A string
will also be defined if string is given. Diver- sion and/or
prompt can be empty (&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p>RF Reference end. Ends a reference definition and
returns to nor- mal processing. See RS.</p>

<p>RI [roman-text [italic-text [roman-text [...]]]] Even
arguments are printed in roman, odd in italic. See I.</p>

<p>RL [text-indent [1]] Reference list start. Begins a list
where each item is preceded with a automatically incremented
number between square brackets. Text-indent changes the
default indentation.</p>

<p>RP [arg1 [arg2]] Produce reference page. RP can be used
if a reference page is wanted somewhere in the document. It
is not needed if TC is used to produce a table of content.
The reference page will then be printed automatically.</p>

<p>The reference counter will not be reset if arg1 is
1.</p>

<p>Arg2 tells RP whether to eject a page or not. Arg2 0 The
reference page will be printed on a separate page. This is
the default. 1 Do not eject page after the list. 2 Do not
eject page before the list. 3 Do not eject page before and
after the list. The reference items will be separated by a
blank line. Setting number register Ls to 0 will suppress
the line.</p>

<p>The string Rp contains the reference page title and is
normally set to REFERENCES.</p>

<p>RS [string-name] RS begins an automatically numbered
reference definition. Put the string *(Rf where the
reference mark should be and write the reference between
RS/RF at next new line after the reference mark. The
reference number is stored in number register :R. If
string-name is given, a string with that name will be
defined and contain the current reference mark. The string
can be ref- erenced as*[string-name] later in the text.</p>

<p>S [size [spacing]] Set point size and vertical spacing.
If any argument is equal P , then the previous value is
used. A C means current value, and D default value. If + or
- is used before the value, then increment or decrement of
the current value will be done.</p>

<p>SA [arg] Set right-margin justification. Justification
is normally turned on. No argumenent or 0 turns off
justification, a 1 turns on justification.</p>

<p>SETR refname [string] Remember the current header and
page-number as refname. Saves string if string is defined.
string is retrieved with .GETST. See INITR.</p>

<p>SG [arg [1]] Signature line. Prints the authors name(s)
after the formal closing. The argument will be appended to
the reference data, printed at either the first or last
author. The reference data is the location, department and
initials specified with .AU. It will be printed at the first
author if the second argument is given, otherwise at the
last. No reference data will be printed if the author(s) is
specifed thru .WA/.WE. See INTERNALS.</p>

<p>SK [pages] Skip pages. If pages is 0 or omitted, a skip
to the next page will occur unless it is already at the top
of a page. Otherwise it will skip pages pages.</p>

<p>SM string1 [string2 [string3]] Make a string smaller. If
string2 is given, string1 will be smaller and string2
normal, concatenated with string1. With three argument, all
is concatenated, but only string2 is made smaller.</p>

<p>SP [lines] Space vertically. lines can have any
scalingfactor, like 3i or 8v. Several SP in a line will only
produce the maximum number of lines, not the sum. SP will
also be ignored until the first textline in a page. Add
&amp; before SP to avoid this.</p>

<p>TAB reset tabs to every 5n. Normally used to reset any
previous tabpositions.</p>

<p>TB [title [override [flag [refname]]]] Table title,
arguments are the same as for EC. TB uses the num- ber
register Tb as counter. The string Lt controls the title of
the List of Tables, default is LIST OF TABLES. The List of
Tables will only be printed if number register Lt is 1,
default 1. The string Litb contains the word TABLE, wich is
printed before the number. Special handling of the title
will occur if TB is used inside DS/DE, it will not be
affected by the format of DS.</p>

<p>TC [slevel [spacing [tlevel [tab [h1 [h2 [h3 [h4
[h5]]]]]]]]] Table of contents. This macro is normally used
at the last line of the document. It generates a table of
contents with headings up to the level controlled by number
register Cl. Note that Cl controls the saving of headings,
it has nothing to do with TC. Headings with level less than
or equal to slevel will get spac- ing number of lines before
them. Headings with level less than or equal to tlevel will
have their page numbers right justified with dots or spaces
separating the text and the page number. Spaces is used if
tab is greater than zero, otherwise dots. Other headings
will have the page number directly at the end of the heading
text (ragged right).</p>

<p>The rest of the arguments will be printed, centered,
before the table of contents.</p>

<p>The user-defined macros TX and TY are used if TC is
called with at most four arguments. TX is called before the
printing of CONTENTS, and TY is called instead of printing
CONTENTS.</p>

<p>Equivalent macros can be defined for list of figures,
tables, equations and excibits by defining TXxx or TYxx,
where xx is Fg, TB, EC or EX.</p>

<p>String Ci can be set to control the indentations for
each head- ing-level. It must be scaled, like .ds Ci .25i
.5i .75i 1i 1i. The indentation is normally controlled by
the maxlength of head- ings in each level.</p>

<p>All texts can be redefined, new stringvariables Lifg,
Litb, Liex, Liec and Licon contain &quot;Figure&quot;,
&quot;TABLE&quot;, &quot;Exhibit&quot;, &quot;Equation&quot;
and &quot;CONTENTS&quot;. These can be redefined to other
lan- guages.</p>

<p>TE Table end. See TS.</p>

<p>TH [N] Table header. See TS. TH ends the header of the
table. This header will be printed again if a page-break
occurs. Argument N isnt implemented yet.</p>

<p>TL [charging-case number(s) [filing-case number(s)]]
Begin title of memorandum. All text up to the next AU is
included in the title. Charging-case number and filing-case
are saved for use in the front page processing.</p>

<p>TM [num1 [num2 [...]]] Technical memorandumnumbers used
in .MT. Unlimited number of arguments may be given.</p>

<p>TP Top of page user-defined macro. This macro is called
instead of the normal page header. It is possible to get
complete control over the header. Note that header and
footer is printed in a separate environment. Linelength is
preserved though.</p>

<p>TS [H] Table start. This is the start of a table
specification to tbl. See separate manual for tbl. TS ends
with TE. Argument H tells mm that the table has a header.
See TH.</p>

<p>TX Userdefined table of contents exit. This macro is
called just before TC prints the word CONTENTS. See TC.</p>

<p>TY Userdefined table of contents exit (no
&quot;CONTENTS&quot;). This macro is called instead of
printing CONTENTS. See TC.</p>

<p>VERBON [flag [pointsize [font]]] Begin verbatim output
using courier font. Usually for printing programs. All
character has equal width. The pointsize can be changed with
the second argument. By specifying the font-argu- ment it is
possible to use another font instead of courier. flag
controls several special features. It contains the sum of
all wanted features. ValueDescription 1 Disable the
escape-character (. This is normally turned on during
verbose output. 2 Add an empty line before the verbose text.
4 Add an empty line after the verbose text. 8 Print the
verbose text with numbered lines. This adds four digitsized
spaces in the beginning of each line. Finer control is
available with the string-variable Verbnm. It contains all
arguments to the troff-command .nm, normally 1. 16 Indent
the verbose text with five n :s. This is con- trolled by the
number-variable Verbin (in units).</p>

<p>VERBOFF End verbatim output.</p>

<p>VL text-indent [mark-indent [1]] Variable-item list has
no fixed mark, it assumes that every LI have a mark instead.
Text-indent sets the indent to the text, and mark-indent the
distance from the current indent to the mark. A third
argument will prohibit printing of a blank line before each
item.</p>

<p>VM [-T] [top [bottom]] Vertical margin. Adds extra
vertical top and margin space. Option -T set the total space
instead. No argument resets the margin to zero or the
default (7v 5v) if -T was used. It is higly recommended that
macro TP and/or EOP are defined if using -T and setting top
and/or bottom margin to less than the default.</p>

<p>WA [writer-name [title]] Begins specification of the
writer and writers address. Sev- eral names can be specified
with empty WA/WE-pairs, but only one address.</p>

<p>WE Ends the address-specification after .WA.</p>

<p>WC [format] Footnote and display width control. N Set
default mode, -WF, -FF, -WD and FB. WF Wide footnotes, wide
also in two-column mode. -WF Normal footnote width, follow
column mode. FF All footnotes gets the same width as the
first footnote encountered. -FF Normal footnotes, width
follows WF and -WF. WD Wide displays, wide also in
two-column mode. -WD Normal display width, follow column
mode. FB Floating displays generates a line break when
printed on the current page. -FB Floating displays does not
generate line break.</p>

<p>INTERNALS The letter macros is using different submacros
depending on the letter type. The name of the submacro has
the letter type as suffix. It is therefore possible to
define other letter types, either in the national
macro-file, or as local additions. .LT will set the number
variables Pt and Pi to 0 and 5. The following strings and
macros must be defined for a new letter type:</p>

<p>let@init_type This macro is called directly by .LT. It
is supposed to ini- tialize variables and other stuff.</p>

<p>let@head_type This macro prints the letter head, and is
called instead of the normal page header. It is supposed to
remove the alias let@header, otherwise it will be called for
all pages.</p>

<p>let@sg_type name title n flag [arg1 [arg2 [...]]] .SG is
calling this macro only for letters, memorandums has its own
processing. name and title is specified thru .WA/.WB. n is
the counter, 1-max, and flag is true for the last name. Any
other argument to .SG is appended.</p>

<p>let@fc_type closing This macro is called by .FC, and has
the formal closing as argu- ment.</p>

<p>.LO is implemented as a general option-macro. .LO
demands that a string named Lettype is defined, where type
is the letter type. .LO will then assign the argument to the
string variable let*lo-type.</p>
