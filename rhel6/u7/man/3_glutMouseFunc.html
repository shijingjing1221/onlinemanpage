<p>NAME glutMouseFunc - Sets the mouse-button callback for
the current window.</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - input</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutMouseFunc(void( *callback )( int button, int
state, int x, int y ));</p>

<p>PARAMETERS callback Client hook for mouse-buttons.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Whenever a mouse button is pressed or
released in an OpenGLUT window, OpenGLUT checks if that
window has a mouse-button (Mouse) callback regis- tered. If
so, OpenGLUT gives the event to the handler. button is the
button number, starting from 0. state is GLUT_UP or
GLUT_DOWN to indicate the buttons new state. The other
parameters are the mouse coordinates.</p>

<p>Mouse wheel motion can be reported as buttons. If you do
not request otherwise, a wheel spun forward will act like a
button clicking down, immediately followed by clicking up.
Spinning the same wheel backward will act like a different
button clicking. Mouse wheel pseudo-buttons are added after
all real buttons.</p>

<p>While the button is held and the mouse is dragged, you
receive mouse- motion events (glutMotionFunc()), even if the
mouse is dragged out of the window.</p>

<p>This callback is bound to the current window .</p>

<p>CAVEATS Reporting the wheel as buttons is actually
inherited from X. freeglut added code to support this on
WIN32. OpenGLUT inherited that support from freeglut.</p>

<p>Old GLUT defines the symbols GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON,
GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON, and GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON. However, mice can
have more than 3 buttons, so these symbols are
deprecated.</p>

<p>Windows created via glutCreateMenuWindow() always
cascade keyboard and mouse events to their parent.</p>
