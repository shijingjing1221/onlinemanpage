<p>IPSEC_VERIFY(8) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_VERIFY(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_verify - see if FreeSWAN has been installed
correctly</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec verify [--host name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Invoked without argument, verify examines
the local system for a number of common system faults: IPsec
not in path, no secrets file generated, pluto not running,
and IPsec support not present in kernel (or IPsec module not
loaded). If two or more interfaces are found, it performs
checks relevant on an IPsec gateway: whether IP forwarding
is allowed, and if so, whether MASQ or NAT rules are in
play.</p>

<p>In addition, verify performs checks relevant to
Opportunistic Encryption. It looks in forward DNS for a TXT
record for the system&acute;s hostname, and in reverse DNS
for a TXT record for the system&acute;s IP addresses. It
checks whether the system has a public IP.</p>

<p>The --host option causes verify to look for a TXT record
for name in forward and reverse DNS.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/ipsec_eroute /etc/ipsec.secrets</p>

<p>HISTORY Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Michael Richardson.</p>

<p>BUGS Verify does not check for ipchains
masquerading.</p>

<p>Verify does not look for TXT records for Opportunistic
clients behind the system.</p>
