<p>OPTIONS -V, -Version print the version of the bridge
utility and exit.</p>

<p>-s, -stats, -statistics output more information. If this
option is given multiple times, the amount of information
increases. As a rule, the information is statistics or some
time values.</p>

<p>BRIDGE - COMMAND SYNTAX OBJECT link - Bridge port.</p>

<p>fdb - Forwarding Database entry.</p>

<p>mdb - Multicast group database entry.</p>

<p>vlan - VLAN filter list.</p>

<p>COMMAND Specifies the action to perform on the object.
The set of possible actions depends on the object type. As a
rule, it is possible to add, delete and show (or list )
objects, but some objects do not allow all of these
operations or have some additional commands. The help
command is available for all objects. It prints out a list
of available com- mands and argument syntax conventions.</p>

<p>If no command is given, some default command is assumed.
Usually it is list or, if the objects of this class cannot
be listed, help.</p>

<p>bridge link - bridge port link objects correspond to the
port devices of the bridge.</p>

<p>The corresponding commands set and display port status
and bridge spe- cific attributes.</p>

<p>bridge link set - set bridge specific attributes on a
port dev NAME interface name of the bridge port</p>

<p>cost COST the STP path cost of the specified port.</p>

<p>priority PRIO the STP port priority. The priority value
is an unsigned 8-bit quantity (number between 0 and 255).
This metric is used in the designated port an droot port
selectio algorithms.</p>

<p>state STATE the operation state of the port. This is
primarily used by user space STP/RSTP implementation. The
following is a list of valid values:</p>

<p>0 - port is DISABLED. Make this port completely
inactive.</p>

<p>1 - STP LISTENING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on
the brige. In this state the port for list for STP BPDUs and
drop all other traffic.</p>

<p>2 - STP LEARNING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on
the bridge. In this state the port will accept traffic only
for the purpose of updating MAC adress tables.</p>

<p>3 - STP FORWARDING state. Port is fully active.</p>

<p>4 - STP BLOCKING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on
the bridge. This state is used during the STP election
process. In this state, port will only process STP
BPDUs.</p>

<p>guard on or guard off Controls whether STP BPUDs will be
processed by the bridge port. By default, the flag is turned
off allowed BPDU processing. Turning this flag on will cause
the port to stop processing STP BPDUs.</p>

<p>hairpin on or hairpin off Controls whether traffic may
be send back out of the port on which it was received. By
default, this flag is turned off and the bridge will not
forward traffic back out of the receiving port.</p>

<p>fastleave on or fastleave off This flag allows the
bridge to immediately stop multicast traf- fic on a port
that receives IGMP Leave message. It is only used with IGMP
snooping is enabled on the bridge. By default the flag is
off.</p>

<p>root_block on or root_block off Controls whether a given
port is allowed to become root port or not. Only used when
STP is enabled on the bridge. By default the flag is
off.</p>

<p>hwmode Some network interface cards support HW bridge
functionality and they may be configured in different modes.
Currently support modes are:</p>

<p>vepa - Data sent between HW ports is sent on the wire to
the external switch.</p>

<p>veb - bridging happens in hardware.</p>

<p>bridge link show - list bridge port configuration. This
command displays the current bridge port configuration and
flags.</p>

<p>bridge fdb - forwarding database management fdb objects
contain known Ethernet addresses on a link.</p>

<p>The corresponding commands display fdb entries, add new
entries, append entries, and delete old ones.</p>

<p>bridge fdb add - add a new fdb entry This command
creates a new fdb entry.</p>

<p>LLADDR the Ethernet MAC address.</p>

<p>dev DEV the interface to which this address is
associated.</p>

<p>self - the address is associated with a software fdb
(default)</p>

<p>router - the destination address is associated with a
router. Valid if the referenced device is a VXLAN type
device and has route shortcircuit enabled.</p>

<p>The next command line parameters apply only when the
specified device DEV is of type VXLAN.</p>

<p>dst IPADDR the IP address of the destination VXLAN
tunnel endpoint where the Ethernet MAC ADDRESS resides.</p>

<p>vni VNI the VXLAN VNI Network Identifier (or VXLAN
Segment ID) to use to connect to the remote VXLAN tunnel
endpoint. If omitted the value specified at vxlan device
creation will be used.</p>

<p>port PORT the UDP destination PORT number to use to
connect to the remote VXLAN tunnel endpoint. If omitted the
default value is used.</p>

<p>via DEVICE device name of the outgoing interface for the
VXLAN device driver to reach the remote VXLAN tunnel
endpoint.</p>

<p>bridge fdb append - append a forwarding database entry
This command adds a new fdb entry with an already known
LLADDR. Valid only for multicast link layer addresses. The
command adds support for broadcast and multicast Ethernet
MAC addresses. The Ethernet MAC address is added multiple
times into the forwarding database and the vxlan device
driver sends a copy of the data packet to each entry
found.</p>

<p>The arguments are the same as with bridge fdb add,</p>

<p>bridge fdb delete - delete a forwarding database entry
This command removes an existing fdb entry.</p>

<p>The arguments are the same as with bridge fdb add.</p>

<p>bridge fdb replace - replace a forwarding database entry
This command replaces an already present fdb entry.</p>

<p>The arguments are the same as with bridge fdb add,</p>

<p>bridge fdb show - list forwarding entries. This command
displays the current forwarding table.</p>

<p>With the -statistics option, the command becomes
verbose. It prints out the last updated and last used time
for each entry.</p>

<p>bridge mdb - multicast group database management mdb
objects contain known IP multicast group addresses on a
link.</p>

<p>The corresponding commands display mdb entries, add new
entries, and delete old ones.</p>

<p>bridge mdb add - add a new multicast group database
entry This command creates a new mdb entry.</p>

<p>dev DEV the interface where this group address is
associated.</p>

<p>port PORT the port whose link is known to have members
of this multicast group.</p>

<p>grp GROUP the IP multicast group address whose members
reside on the link connected to the port.</p>

<p>permanent - the mdb entry is permanent</p>

<p>temp - the mdb entry is temporary (default)</p>

<p>bridge mdb delete - delete a multicast group database
entry This command removes an existing mdb entry.</p>

<p>The arguments are the same as with bridge mdb add.</p>

<p>bridge mdb show - list multicast group database entries
This command displays the current multicast group membership
table. The table is populated by IGMP and MLD snooping in
the bridge driver auto- matically. It can be altered by
bridge mdb add and bridge mdb del com- mands manually
too.</p>

<p>dev DEV the interface only whose entries should be
listed. Default is to list all bridge interfaces.</p>

<p>With the -details option, the command becomes verbose.
It prints out the ports known to have a connected
router.</p>

<p>bridge vlan - VLAN filter list vlan objects contain
known VLAN IDs for a link.</p>

<p>The corresponding commands display vlan filter entries,
add new entries, and delete old ones.</p>

<p>bridge vlan add - add a new vlan filter entry This
command creates a new vlan filter entry.</p>

<p>dev NAME the interface with which this vlan is
associated.</p>

<p>vid VID the VLAN ID that identifies the vlan.</p>

<p>pvid the vlan specified is to be considered a PVID at
ingress. Any untagged frames will be assigned to this
VLAN.</p>

<p>untagged the vlan specified is to be treated as untagged
on egress.</p>

<p>self the vlan is configured on the specified physical
device. Required if the device is the bridge device.</p>

<p>master the vlan is configured on the software bridge
(default).</p>

<p>bridge vlan delete - delete a forwarding database entry
This command removes an existing fdb entry.</p>

<p>The arguments are the same as with bridge vlan add. The
pvid and untagged flags are ignored.</p>

<p>bridge vlan show - list vlan configuration. This command
displays the current VLAN filter table.</p>

<p>bridge monitor - state monitoring The bridge utility can
monitor the state of devices and addresses con- tinuously.
This option has a slightly different format. Namely, the
monitor command is the first in the command line and then
the object list follows:</p>

<p>bridge monitor [ all | OBJECT-LIST ]</p>

<p>OBJECT-LIST is the list of object types that we want to
monitor. It may contain link, fdb, and mdb. If no file
argument is given, bridge opens RTNETLINK, listens on it and
dumps state changes in the format described in previous
sections.</p>

<p>If a file name is given, it does not listen on
RTNETLINK, but opens the file containing RTNETLINK messages
saved in binary format and dumps them. Such a history file
can be generated with the</p>

<p>NOTES This command uses facilities added in Linux
3.0.</p>

<p>Although the forwarding table is maintained on a
per-bridge device basis the bridge device is not part of the
syntax. This is a limitation of the underlying netlink
neighbour message protocol. When displaying the forwarding
table, entries for all bridges are displayed.
Add/delete/modify commands determine the underlying bridge
device based on the bridge to which the corresponding
ethernet device is attached.</p>

<p>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel does not support
changing bridge ports (bridge link set), and listing or
changing VLAN filter lists (bridge vlan). Forwarding
database management is supported on VXLAN ports only (bridge
fdb).</p>
