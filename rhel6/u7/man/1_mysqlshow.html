<p>MYSQLSHOW(1) MySQL Database System MYSQLSHOW(1)</p>

<p>NAME mysqlshow - display database, table, and column
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name
[col_name]]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The mysqlshow client can be used to quickly
see which databases exist, their tables, or a table&rsquo;s
columns or indexes.</p>

<p>mysqlshow provides a command-line interface to several
SQL SHOW statements. See Section 13.7.5, SHOW Syntax. The
same information can be obtained by using those statements
directly. For example, you can issue them from the mysql
client program.</p>

<p>Invoke mysqlshow like this:</p>

<p>shell&gt; mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name
[col_name]]]</p>

<p>&middot; If no database is given, a list of database
names is shown.</p>

<p>&middot; If no table is given, all matching tables in
the database are shown.</p>

<p>&middot; If no column is given, all matching columns and
column types in the table are shown.</p>

<p>The output displays only the names of those databases,
tables, or columns for which you have some privileges.</p>

<p>If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard
characters (*, ? , % , or _), only those names that are
matched by the wildcard are shown. If a database name
contains any underscores, those should be escaped with a
backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a list of
the proper tables or columns. * and ? characters are
converted into SQL % and _ wildcard characters. This might
cause some confusion when you try to display the columns for
a table with a _ in the name, because in this case,
mysqlshow shows you only the table names that match the
pattern. This is easily fixed by adding an extra % last on
the command line as a separate argument.</p>

<p>mysqlshow supports the following options, which can be
specified on the command line or in the [mysqlshow] and
[client] groups of an option file. mysqlshow also supports
the options for processing option files described at Section
4.2.3.4, Command-Line Options that Affect Option- File
Handling.</p>

<p>&middot; --help, -?</p>

<p>Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p>&middot; --bind-address=ip_address</p>

<p>On a computer having multiple network interfaces, this
option can be used to select which interface is employed
when connecting to the MySQL server.</p>

<p>This option is supported only in the version of
mysqlshow that is supplied with MySQL Cluster, beginning
with MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.4. It is not available in
standard MySQL 5.1 releases.</p>

<p>&middot; --character-sets-dir=path</p>

<p>The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --compress, -C</p>

<p>Compress all information sent between the client and the
server if both support compression.</p>

<p>&middot; --count</p>

<p>Show the number of rows per table. This can be slow for
non-MyISAM tables.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]</p>

<p>Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
&rsquo;d:t:o,file_name&rsquo;. The default is
&rsquo;d:t:o&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-check</p>

<p>Print some debugging information when the program exits.
This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p>&middot; --debug-info</p>

<p>Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
statistics when the program exits. This option was added in
MySQL 5.1.14.</p>

<p>&middot; --default-character-set=charset_name</p>

<p>Use charset_name as the default character set. See
Section 10.5, Character Set Configuration.</p>

<p>&middot; --host=host_name, -h host_name</p>

<p>Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.</p>

<p>&middot; --keys, -k</p>

<p>Show table indexes.</p>

<p>&middot; --password[=password], -p[password]</p>

<p>The password to use when connecting to the server. If
you use the short option form (-p), you cannot have a space
between the option and the password. If you omit the
password value following the --password or -p option on the
command line, mysqlshow prompts for one.</p>

<p>Specifying a password on the command line should be
considered insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, End-User
Guidelines for Password Security. You can use an option file
to avoid giving the password on the command line.</p>

<p>&middot; --pipe, -W</p>

<p>On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe.
This option applies only if the server supports named-pipe
connections.</p>

<p>&middot; --port=port_num, -P port_num</p>

<p>The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.</p>

<p>&middot; --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</p>

<p>The connection protocol to use for connecting to the
server. It is useful when the other connection parameters
normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the
one you want. For details on the permissible values, see
Section 4.2.2, Connecting to the MySQL Server.</p>

<p>&middot; --show-table-type, -t</p>

<p>Show a column indicating the table type, as in SHOW FULL
TABLES. The type is BASE TABLE or VIEW.</p>

<p>&middot; --socket=path, -S path</p>

<p>For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to
use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.</p>

<p>&middot; --ssl*</p>

<p>Options that begin with --ssl specify whether to connect
to the server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys
and certificates. See Section 6.3.6.4, SSL Command Options
.</p>

<p>&middot; --status, -i</p>

<p>Display extra information about each table.</p>

<p>&middot; --user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p>The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the
server.</p>

<p>&middot; --verbose, -v</p>

<p>Verbose mode. Print more information about what the
program does. This option can be used multiple times to
increase the amount of information.</p>

<p>&middot; --version, -V</p>

<p>Display version information and exit.</p>
