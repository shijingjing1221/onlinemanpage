<p>Name mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix</p>

<p>Note of warning This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation, and may not be
entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page
for details.</p>

<p>Description The mcopy command is used to copy MS-DOS
files to and from Unix. It uses the following syntax:</p>

<p>mcopy [-bspanvmQT] [-D clash_option] sourcefile
targetfile mcopy [-bspanvmQT] [-D clash_option] sourcefile [
sourcefiles... ] targetdirectory mcopy [-tnvm]
MSDOSsourcefile</p>

<p>Mcopy copies the specified file to the named file, or
copies multiple files to the named directory. The source and
target can be either MS- DOS or Unix files.</p>

<p>The use of a drive letter designation on the MS-DOS
files, a: for example, determines the direction of the
transfer. A missing drive designation implies a Unix file
whose path starts in the current direc- tory. If a source
drive letter is specified with no attached file name (e.g.
mcopy a: .), all files are copied from that drive.</p>

<p>If only a single, MS-DOS source parameter is provided
(e.g. &quot;mcopy a:foo.exe&quot;), an implied destination
of the current directory (.) is assumed.</p>

<p>A filename of - means standard input or standard output,
depending on its position on the command line.</p>

<p>Mcopy accepts the following command line options:</p>

<p>t Text file transfer. Mcopy translates incoming carriage
return/line feeds to line feeds when copying from Dos to
Unix, and vice-versa when copying from Unix to Dos.</p>

<p>b Batch mode. Optimized for huge recursive copies, but
less secure if a crash happens during the copy.</p>

<p>s Recursive copy. Also copies directories and their
contents</p>

<p>p Preserves the attributes of the copied files</p>

<p>Q When mcopying multiple files, quits as soon as one
copy fails (for example due to lacking storage space on the
target disk)</p>

<p>a Text (Ascii) file transfer. Mcopy translates incoming
carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.</p>

<p>T Text (Ascii) file transfer with charset conversion.
Differs from -a in the Mcopy also translates incoming PC-8
characters to ISO-8859-1 equivalents as far as possible.
When reading DOS files, untranslatable characters are
replaced by #; when writing DOS files, untranslatable
characters are replaced by ..</p>

<p>n No confirmation when overwriting Unix files. Mcopy
doesnt warn the user when overwriting an existing Unix file.
If the target file already exists, and the -n option is not
in effect, mcopy asks whether to overwrite the file or to
rename the new file (name clashes) for details). In order to
switch off confirma- tion for DOS files, use -o.</p>

<p>m Preserve the file modification time.</p>

<p>v Verbose. Displays the name of each file as it is
copied.</p>

<p>Bugs Unlike MS-DOS, the + operator (append) from MS-DOS
is not supported. However, you may use mtype to produce the
same effect:</p>

<p>mtype a:file1 a:file2 a:file3 &gt;unixfile mtype a:file1
a:file2 a:file3 | mcopy - a:msdosfile</p>

<p>Viewing the texi doc This manpage has been automatically
generated from mtoolss texinfo documentation. However, this
process is only approximative, and some items, such as
crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate
represen- tation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all
information has been translated into the manpage version.
Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.
See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the
texinfo doc.</p>

<p>* To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run
the fol- lowing commands:</p>

<p>./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi</p>

<p>* To generate a html copy, run:</p>

<p>./configure; make html</p>

<p>A premade html can be found at http://www.gnu.org/soft-
ware/mtools/manual/mtools.html</p>

<p>* To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs info
mode), run:</p>

<p>./configure; make info</p>

<p>The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as
html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in
info.</p>
