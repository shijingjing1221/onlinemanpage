<p>C99(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual C99(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME c99 - compile standard C programs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS c99 [-c][-D name[=value]]...[-E][-g][-I
directory] ... [-L directory] ... [-o
outfile][-Ooptlevel][-s][-U name]... operand ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The c99 utility is an interface to the
standard C compilation system; it shall accept source code
conforming to the ISO C standard. The sys- tem conceptually
consists of a compiler and link editor. The files ref-
erenced by operands shall be compiled and linked to produce
an exe- cutable file. (It is unspecified whether the linking
occurs entirely within the operation of c99; some
implementations may produce objects that are not fully
resolved until the file is executed.)</p>

<p>If the -c option is specified, for all pathname operands
of the form file .c, the files:</p>

<p>$(basename pathname .c).o</p>

<p>shall be created as the result of successful
compilation. If the -c option is not specified, it is
unspecified whether such .o files are created or deleted for
the file .c operands.</p>

<p>If there are no options that prevent link editing (such
as -c or -E), and all operands compile and link without
error, the resulting exe- cutable file shall be written
according to the -o outfile option (if present) or to the
file a.out.</p>

<p>The executable file shall be created as specified in
File Read, Write, and Creation, except that the file
permission bits shall be set to:</p>

<p>S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU</p>

<p>and the bits specified by the umask of the process shall
be cleared.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The c99 utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines, except that:</p>

<p>* The -l library operands have the format of options,
but their posi- tion within a list of operands affects the
order in which libraries are searched.</p>

<p>* The order of specifying the -I and -L options is
significant.</p>

<p>* Conforming applications shall specify each option
separately; that is, grouping option letters (for example,
-cO) need not be recog- nized by all implementations.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-c Suppress the link-edit phase of the compilation, and
do not remove any object files that are produced.</p>

<p>-g Produce symbolic information in the object or
executable files; the nature of this information is
unspecified, and may be modi- fied by implementation-defined
interactions with other options.</p>

<p>-s Produce object or executable files, or both, from
which symbolic and other information not required for proper
execution using the exec family defined in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 has been removed
(stripped). If both -g and -s options are present, the
action taken is unspecified.</p>

<p>-o outfile Use the pathname outfile, instead of the
default a.out, for the executable file produced. If the -o
option is present with -c or -E, the result is
unspecified.</p>

<p>-D name[=value]</p>

<p>Define name as if by a C-language #define directive. If
no = value is given, a value of 1 shall be used. The -D
option has lower precedence than the -U option. That is, if
name is used in both a -U and a -D option, name shall be
undefined regardless of the order of the options. Additional
implementation-defined names may be provided by the
compiler. Implementations shall support at least 2048 bytes
of -D definitions and 256 names.</p>

<p>-E Copy C-language source files to standard output,
expanding all preprocessor directives; no compilation shall
be performed. If any operand is not a text file, the effects
are unspecified.</p>

<p>-I directory Change the algorithm for searching for
headers whose names are not absolute pathnames to look in
the directory named by the directory pathname before looking
in the usual places. Thus, headers whose names are enclosed
in double-quotes ( &quot;&quot; ) shall be searched for
first in the directory of the file with the #include line,
then in directories named in -I options, and last in the
usual places. For headers whose names are enclosed in angle
brackets ( &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; ), the header shall be
searched for only in directories named in -I options and
then in the usual places. Directories named in -I options
shall be searched in the order specified. Implementations
shall support at least ten instances of this option in a
single c99 command invocation.</p>

<p>-L directory Change the algorithm of searching for the
libraries named in the -l objects to look in the directory
named by the directory path- name before looking in the
usual places. Directories named in -L options shall be
searched in the order specified. Implementa- tions shall
support at least ten instances of this option in a single
c99 command invocation. If a directory specified by a -L
option contains files named libc.a, libm.a, libl.a, or
liby.a, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p>-O optlevel Specify the level of code optimization. If
the optlevel option- argument is the digit 0 , all special
code optimizations shall be disabled. If it is the digit,
the nature of the optimiza- tion is unspecified. If the -O
option is omitted, the nature of the systems default
optimization is unspecified. It is unspeci- fied whether
code generated in the presence of the -O 0 option is the
same as that generated when -O is omitted. Other optlevel
values may be supported.</p>

<p>-U name Remove any initial definition of name.</p>

<p>Multiple instances of the -D, -I, -U, and -L options can
be specified.</p>

<p>OPERANDS An operand is either in the form of a pathname
or the form -l library. The application shall ensure that at
least one operand of the pathname form is specified. The
following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>file.c A C-language source file to be compiled and
optionally linked. The application shall ensure that the
operand is of this form if the -c option is used.</p>

<p>file.a A library of object files typically produced by
the ar utility, and passed directly to the link editor.
Implementations may rec- ognize implementation-defined
suffixes other than .a as denoting object file
libraries.</p>

<p>file.o An object file produced by c99 -c and passed
directly to the link editor. Implementations may recognize
implementation- defined suffixes other than .o as denoting
object files.</p>

<p>The processing of other files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>-l library (The letter ell.) Search the library
named:</p>

<p>liblibrary.a</p>

<p>A library shall be searched when its name is
encountered, so the place- ment of a -l operand is
significant. Several standard libraries can be specified in
this manner, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION sec-
tion. Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
suffixes other than .a as denoting libraries.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input file shall be one of the
following: a text file containing a C-language source
program, an object file in the format produced by c99 -c, or
a library of object files, in the format produced by
archiving zero or more object files, using ar.
Implementations may supply addi- tional utilities that
produce files in these formats. Additional input file
formats are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of c99:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>TMPDIR Provide a pathname that should override the
default directory for temporary files, if any. On
XSI-conforming systems, provide a pathname that shall
override the default directory for tempo- rary files, if
any.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If more than one file operand ending in .c (or
possibly other unspeci- fied suffixes) is given, for each
such file:</p>

<p>&quot;%sn&quot;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>may be written. These messages, if written, shall
precede the process- ing of each input file; they shall not
be written to the standard out- put if they are written to
the standard error, as described in the STDERR section.</p>

<p>If the -E option is specified, the standard output shall
be a text file that represents the results of the
preprocessing stage of the language; it may contain extra
information appropriate for subsequent compilation
passes.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages. If more than one file operand ending in
.c (or possibly other unspecified suf- fixes) is given, for
each such file:</p>

<p>&quot;%sn&quot;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>may be written to allow identification of the diagnostic
and warning messages with the appropriate input file. These
messages, if written, shall precede the processing of each
input file; they shall not be written to the standard error
if they are written to the standard out- put, as described
in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p>This utility may produce warning messages about certain
conditions that do not warrant returning an error (non-zero)
exit value.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES Object files or executable files or both
are produced in unspecified formats.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION Standard Libraries The c99 utility
shall recognize the following -l operands for standard
libraries:</p>

<p>-l c This operand shall make visible all functions
referenced in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, with the possible exception of those functions
listed as residing in &lt;aio.h&gt;, &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;,
&lt;complex.h&gt;, &lt;fenv.h&gt;, &lt;math.h&gt;,
&lt;mqueue.h&gt;, &lt;netdb.h&gt;, &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;,
&lt;pthread.h&gt;, &lt;sched.h&gt;, &lt;semaphore.h&gt;,
&lt;spawn.h&gt;, &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;, pthread_kill(), and
pthread_sigmask() in &lt;signal.h&gt;, &lt;trace.h&gt;,
functions marked as extensions other than as part of the MF
or MPR extensions in &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;, functions marked as
ADV in &lt;fcntl.h&gt;, and func- tions marked as CS, CPT,
and TMR in &lt;time.h&gt;. This operand shall not be
required to be present to cause a search of this
library.</p>

<p>-l l This operand shall make visible all functions
required by the C- language output of lex that are not made
available through the -l c operand.</p>

<p>-l pthread This operand shall make visible all functions
referenced in &lt;pthread.h&gt; and pthread_kill() and
pthread_sigmask() referenced in &lt;signal.h&gt;. An
implementation may search this library in the absence of
this operand.</p>

<p>-l m This operand shall make visible all functions
referenced in &lt;math.h&gt;, &lt;complex.h&gt;, and
&lt;fenv.h&gt;. An implementation may search this library in
the absence of this operand.</p>

<p>-l rt This operand shall make visible all functions
referenced in &lt;aio.h&gt;, &lt;mqueue.h&gt;,
&lt;sched.h&gt;, &lt;semaphore.h&gt;, and &lt;spawn.h&gt;,
functions marked as extensions other than as part of the MF
or MPR extensions in &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;, functions marked as
ADV in &lt;fcntl.h&gt;, and functions marked as CS, CPT, and
TMR in &lt;time.h&gt;. An implementation may search this
library in the absence of this operand.</p>

<p>-l trace This operand shall make visible all functions
referenced in &lt;trace.h&gt;. An implementation may search
this library in the absence of this operand.</p>

<p>-l xnet This operand makes visible all functions
referenced in &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;, &lt;netdb.h&gt;,
&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;, and &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;. An
implementation may search this library in the absence of
this operand.</p>

<p>-l y This operand shall make visible all functions
required by the C- language output of yacc that are not made
available through the -l c operand.</p>

<p>In the absence of options that inhibit invocation of the
link editor, such as -c or -E, the c99 utility shall cause
the equivalent of a -l c operand to be passed to the link
editor as the last -l operand, causing it to be searched
after all other object files and libraries are loaded.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether the libraries libc.a, libm.a,
librt.a, libpthread.a, libl.a, liby.a, or libxnet.a exist as
regular files. The implementation may accept as -l operands
names of objects that do not exist as regular files.</p>

<p>External Symbols The C compiler and link editor shall
support the significance of exter- nal symbols up to a
length of at least 31 bytes; the action taken upon
encountering symbols exceeding the implementation-defined
maximum sym- bol length is unspecified.</p>

<p>The compiler and link editor shall support a minimum of
511 external symbols per source or object file, and a
minimum of 4095 external symbols in total. A diagnostic
message shall be written to the standard output if the
implementation-defined limit is exceeded; other actions are
unspecified.</p>

<p>Programming Environments All implementations shall
support one of the following programming environments as a
default. Implementations may support more than one of the
following programming environments. Applications can use
sysconf() or getconf to determine which programming
environments are supported.</p>

<p>Table: Programming Environments: Type Sizes</p>

<p>Programming Environment Bits in Bits in Bits in Bits in
getconf Name int long pointer off_t _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32 32
32 32 32 _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG 32 32 32 &gt;=64
_POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64 32 64 64 64 _POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG
&gt;=32 &gt;=64 &gt;=64 &gt;=64</p>

<p>All implementations shall support one or more
environments where the widths of the following types are no
greater than the width of type long: blksize_t, cc_t,
mode_t, nfds_t, pid_t, ptrdiff_t, size_t, speed_t, ssize_t,
suseconds_t, tcflag_t, useconds_t, wchar_t, wint_t</p>

<p>The executable files created when these environments are
selected shall be in a proper format for execution by the
exec family of functions. Each environment may be one of the
ones in Programming Environments: Type Sizes, or it may be
another environment. The names for the envi- ronments that
meet this requirement shall be output by a getconf com- mand
using the _POSIX_V6_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS argument. If more
than one environment meets the requirement, the names of all
such environ- ments shall be output on separate lines. Any
of these names can then be used in a subsequent getconf
command to obtain the flags specific to that environment
with the following suffixes added as appropriate:</p>

<p>_CFLAGS To get the C compiler flags.</p>

<p>_LDFLAGS To get the linker/loader flags.</p>

<p>_LIBS To get the libraries.</p>

<p>This requirement may be removed in a future version of
IEEE Std 1003.1.</p>

<p>When this utility processes a file containing a function
called main(), it shall be defined with a return type
equivalent to int. Using return from the initial call to
main() shall be equivalent (other than with respect to
language scope issues) to calling exit() with the returned
value. Reaching the end of the initial call to main() shall
be equiva- lent to calling exit(0). The implementation shall
not declare a proto- type for this function.</p>

<p>Implementations provide configuration strings for C
compiler flags, linker/loader flags, and libraries for each
supported environment. When an application needs to use a
specific programming environment rather than the
implementation default programming environment while compil-
ing, the application shall first verify that the
implementation sup- ports the desired environment. If the
desired programming environment is supported, the
application shall then invoke c99 with the appropri- ate C
compiler flags as the first options for the compile, the
appro- priate linker/loader flags after any other options
but before any operands, and the appropriate libraries at
the end of the operands.</p>

<p>Conforming applications shall not attempt to link
together object files compiled for different programming
models. Applications shall also be aware that binary data
placed in shared memory or in files might not be recognized
by applications built for other programming models.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful compilation or link edit.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS When c99 encounters a compilation
error that causes an object file not to be created, it shall
write a diagnostic to standard error and con- tinue to
compile other source code operands, but it shall not perform
the link phase and return a non-zero exit status. If the
link edit is unsuccessful, a diagnostic message shall be
written to standard error and c99 exits with a non-zero
status. A conforming application shall rely on the exit
status of c99, rather than on the existence or mode of the
executable file.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Since the c99 utility usually creates
files in the current directory during the compilation
process, it is typically necessary to run the c99 utility in
a directory in which a file can be created.</p>

<p>On systems providing POSIX Conformance (see the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 2,
Conformance), c99 is required only with the C-Language
Development option; XSI-conformant systems always provide
c99.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations have created .o files
when -c is not specified and more than one source file is
given. Since this area is left unspecified, the application
cannot rely on .o files being cre- ated, but it also must be
prepared for any related .o files that already exist being
deleted at the completion of the link edit.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations have permitted -L
options to be inter- spersed with -l operands on the command
line. For an application to compile consistently on systems
that do not behave like this, it is necessary for a
conforming application to supply all -L options before any
of the -l options.</p>

<p>There is the possible implication that if a user
supplies versions of the standard functions (before they
would be encountered by an implicit -l c or explicit -l m),
that those versions would be used in place of the standard
versions. There are various reasons this might not be true
(functions defined as macros, manipulations for clean name
space, and so on), so the existence of files named in the
same manner as the standard libraries within the -L
directories is explicitly stated to produce unspecified
behavior.</p>

<p>All of the functions specified in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 may be made visible by
implementations when the Standard C Library is searched.
Conforming applications must explicitly request searching
the other standard libraries when functions made vis- ible
by those libraries are used.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following usage example compiles foo.c
and creates the exe- cutable file foo:</p>

<p>c99 -o foo foo.c</p>

<p>The following usage example compiles foo.c and creates
the object file foo.o:</p>

<p>c99 -c foo.c</p>

<p>The following usage example compiles foo.c and creates
the executable file a.out:</p>

<p>c99 foo.c</p>

<p>The following usage example compiles foo.c, links it
with bar.o, and creates the executable file a.out. It may
also create and leave foo.o:</p>

<p>c99 foo.c bar.o</p>

<p>2. The following example shows how an application using
threads inter- faces can test for support of and use a
programming environment supporting 32-bit int, long, and
pointer types and an off_t type using at least 64 bits:</p>

<p>if [ $(getconf _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG) != &quot;-1&quot;
] then c99 $(getconf POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_CFLAGS)
-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 $(getconf POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS)
foo.c -o foo $(getconf POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_LIBS) -l
pthread else echo ILP32_OFFBIG programming environment not
supported exit 1 fi</p>

<p>3. The following examples clarify the use and
interactions of -L options and -l operands.</p>

<p>Consider the case in which module a.c calls function f()
in library libQ.a, and module b.c calls function g() in
library libp.a. Assume that both libraries reside in /a/b/c.
The command line to compile and link in the desired way
is:</p>

<p>c99 -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q b.c -l p</p>

<p>In this case the -l Q operand need only precede the
first -l p operand, since both libQ.a and libp.a reside in
the same directory.</p>

<p>Multiple -L operands can be used when library name
collisions occur. Building on the previous example, suppose
that the user wants to use a new libp.a, in /a/a/a, but
still wants f() from /a/b/c/libQ.a:</p>

<p>c99 -L /a/a/a -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q b.c -l p</p>

<p>In this example, the linker searches the -L options in
the order speci- fied, and finds /a/a/a/libp.a before
/a/b/c/libp.a when resolving ref- erences for b.c. The order
of the -l operands is still important, how- ever.</p>

<p>4. The following example shows how an application can
use a program- ming environment where the widths of the
following types: blk- size_t, cc_t, mode_t, nfds_t, pid_t,
ptrdiff_t, size_t, speed_t, ssize_t, suseconds_t, tcflag_t,
useconds_t, wchar_t, wint_t</p>

<p>are no greater than the width of type long:</p>

<p># First choose one of the listed environments ...</p>

<p># ... if there are no additional constraints, the first
one will do: CENV=$(getconf _POSIX_V6_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS
| head -n l)</p>

<p># ... or, if an environment that supports large files is
preferred, # look for names that contain &quot;OFF64&quot;
or &quot;OFFBIG&quot;. (This chooses # the last one in the
list if none match.) for CENV in $(getconf
_POSIX_V6_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS) do case $CENV in
*OFF64*|*OFFBIG*) break ;; esac done</p>

<p># The chosen environment name can now be used like
this:</p>

<p>c99 $(getconf ${CENV}_CFLAGS) -D _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L
$(getconf ${CENV}_LDFLAGS) foo.c -o foo $(getconf
${CENV}_LIBS)</p>

<p>RATIONALE The c99 utility is based on the c89 utility
originally introduced in the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard.</p>

<p>Some of the changes from c89 include the modification to
the contents of the Standard Libraries section to account
for new headers and options; for example, &lt;spawn.h&gt;
added to the -l rt operand, and the -l trace operand added
for the Tracing functions.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
