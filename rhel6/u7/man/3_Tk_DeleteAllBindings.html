<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tk_CreateBindingTable, Tk_DeleteBindingTable,
Tk_CreateBinding, Tk_DeleteBinding, Tk_GetBinding,
Tk_GetAllBindings, Tk_DeleteAllBind- ings, Tk_BindEvent -
invoke scripts in response to X events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tk_BindingTable Tk_CreateBindingTable(interp)</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteBindingTable(bindingTable)</p>

<p>unsigned long Tk_CreateBinding(interp, bindingTable,
object, eventString, script, append)</p>

<p>int Tk_DeleteBinding(interp, bindingTable, object,
eventString)</p>

<p>const char * Tk_GetBinding(interp, bindingTable, object,
eventString)</p>

<p>Tk_GetAllBindings(interp, bindingTable, object)</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteAllBindings(bindingTable, object)</p>

<p>Tk_BindEvent(bindingTable, eventPtr, tkwin, numObjects,
objectPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter to use
when invoking bindings in binding table. Also used for
returning results and errors from binding procedures.</p>

<p>Tk_BindingTable bindingTable (in) Token for binding
table; must have been returned by some previous call to
Tk_CreateBindingTable.</p>

<p>ClientData object (in) Identifies object with which
binding is associated.</p>

<p>const char *eventString (in) String describing event
sequence.</p>

<p>char *script (in) Tcl script to invoke when binding
triggers.</p>

<p>int append (in) Non-zero means append script to existing
script for bind- ing, if any; zero means replace existing
script with new one.</p>

<p>XEvent *eventPtr (in) X event to match against bindings
in bindingTable.</p>

<p>Tk_Window tkwin (in) Identifier for any window on the
display where the event occurred. Used to find dis-
play-related information such as key maps.</p>

<p>int numObjects (in) Number of object identifiers pointed
to by objectPtr.</p>

<p>ClientData *objectPtr (in) Points to an array of object
identifiers: bindings will be considered for each of these
objects in order from first to last.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures provide a general-purpose
mechanism for creating and invoking bindings. Bindings are
organized in terms of binding tables. A binding table
consists of a collection of bindings plus a history of
recent events. Within a binding table, bindings are
associated with objects. The meaning of an object is defined
by clients of the binding package. For example, Tk keeps
uses one binding table to hold all of the bindings created
by the bind command. For this table, objects are pointers to
strings such as window names, class names, or other binding
tags such as all. Tk also keeps a separate binding table for
each can- vas widget, which manages bindings created by the
canvass bind widget command; within this table, an object is
either a pointer to the internal structure for a canvas item
or a Tk_Uid identifying a tag.</p>

<p>The procedure Tk_CreateBindingTable creates a new
binding table and as- sociates interp with it (when bindings
in the table are invoked, the scripts will be evaluated in
interp). Tk_CreateBindingTable returns a token for the
table, which must be used in calls to other procedures such
as Tk_CreateBinding or Tk_BindEvent.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteBindingTable frees all of the state associated
with a binding table. Once it returns the caller should not
use the bindingTable token again.</p>

<p>Tk_CreateBinding adds a new binding to an existing
table. The object argument identifies the object with which
the binding is to be associ- ated, and it may be any
one-word value. Typically it is a pointer to a string or
data structure. The eventString argument identifies the
event or sequence of events for the binding; see the
documentation for the bind command for a description of its
format. script is the Tcl script to be evaluated when the
binding triggers. append indicates what to do if there
already exists a binding for object and eventString: if
append is zero then script replaces the old script; if
append is non-zero then the new script is appended to the
old one. Tk_CreateBinding returns an X event mask for all
the events associated with the bindings. This information
may be useful to invoke XSelectIn- put to select relevant
events, or to disallow the use of certain events in
bindings. If an error occurred while creating the binding
(e.g., eventString refers to a non-existent event), then 0
is returned and an error message is left in
interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteBinding removes from bindingTable the binding
given by object and eventString, if such a binding exists.
Tk_DeleteBinding always returns TCL_OK. In some cases it may
reset interp-&gt;result to the default empty value.</p>

<p>Tk_GetBinding returns a pointer to the script associated
with eventString and object in bindingTable. If no such
binding exists then NULL is returned and an error message is
left in interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>Tk_GetAllBindings returns in interp-&gt;result a list of
all the event strings for which there are bindings in
bindingTable associated with object. If there are no
bindings for object then an empty string is returned in
interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>Tk_DeleteAllBindings deletes all of the bindings in
bindingTable that are associated with object.</p>

<p>Tk_BindEvent is called to process an event. It makes a
copy of the event in an internal history list associated
with the binding table, then it checks for bindings that
match the event. Tk_BindEvent pro- cesses each of the
objects pointed to by objectPtr in turn. For each object, it
finds all the bindings that match the current event history,
selects the most specific binding using the priority
mechanism described in the documentation for bind, and
invokes the script for that binding. If there are no
matching bindings for a particular object, then the object
is skipped. Tk_BindEvent continues through all of the
objects, handling exceptions such as errors, break, and
continue as described in the documentation for bind.</p>
