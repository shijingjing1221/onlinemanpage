<p>ping_selinux(8) SELinux Policy ping ping_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME ping_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the ping processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ping
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The ping processes execute with the ping_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep ping_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The ping_t SELinux type can be entered via
the ping_exec_t file type.</p>

<p>The default entrypoint paths for the ping_t domain are
the following:</p>

<p>/bin/ping.*, /usr/sbin/fping.*, /usr/sbin/hping2,
/usr/sbin/send_arp</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux ping policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their ping pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for ping:</p>

<p>ping_t, pingd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a ping_t can be used to make
the process type ping_t permissive. SELinux does not deny
access to permissive pro- cess types, but the AVC (SELinux
denials) messages are still generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. ping policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run ping with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons the ability to
read/write terminals, you must turn on the
allow_daemons_use_tty boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tty 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to use other domains
file descriptors, you must turn on the allow_domain_fd_use
boolean. Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_domain_fd_use 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to run with
kerberos, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all
processes, you must turn on the allow_ptrace boolean.
Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ptrace 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must
turn on the allow_ypbind boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to execute in
fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fips_mode 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable reading of urandom for all
domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P global_ssp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd
shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1</p>

<p>If you want to control users use of ping and traceroute,
you must turn on the user_ping boolean. Enabled by
default.</p>

<p>setsebool -P user_ping 1</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux ping policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ping processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for ping:</p>

<p>pingd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 9125</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type ping_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/rhev /misc</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /tmp-inst /var/tmp-inst
/var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux ping policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ping processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>STANDARD FILE CONTEXT</p>

<p>SELinux defines the file context types for the ping, if
you wanted to store files with these types in a diffent
paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify
alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels
on disk.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t pingd_modules_t
/srv/myping_content(/.*)? restorecon -R -v
/srv/myping_content</p>

<p>Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify
labels that match multiple files.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for ping:</p>

<p>ping_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ping_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the ping_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /bin/ping.*, /usr/sbin/fping.*, /usr/sbin/hping2,
/usr/sbin/send_arp</p>

<p>pingd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_etc_t type, if you want to
store pingd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>pingd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the pingd_t domain.</p>

<p>pingd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the pingd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>pingd_modules_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_modules_t type, if you want
to treat the files as pingd modules.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
