<p>NAME libhugetlbfs - preload library to back text, data,
malloc() or shared memory with hugepages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS export [environment options]
[LD_PRELOAD=libhugetlbfs.so] target_application</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION libhugetlbfs is a library that can back
application text, data, mal- loc() and shared memory with
hugepages. This is of benefit to applica- tions that use
large amounts of address space and suffer a performance hit
due to TLB misses. Wall-clock time or oprofile can be used
to determine if there is a performance benefit from using
libhugetlbfs or not. In all cases but shared memory, a
hugetlbfs mount must exist and a hugepage pool defined for
hugepages to be used.</p>

<p>Some limited functionality is available for unmodified
dynamically linked applications. By preloading the library,
the library can back malloc() and shared memory, and text
and data segments can be partially backed if they are large
enough.</p>

<p>For the effective backing of text and data with huge
pages, the appli- cation must be linked to the library and
the ELF segments correctly aligned using the ld helpers.
Once linked, malloc or shared memory can still be backed but
no pre-loading is required. See /usr/share/doc/lib-
hugetlbfs/HOWTO and ld.hugetlbfs(1) for detailed
instructions on relinking applications.</p>

<p>For applications that are hugepage-aware and linked to
the library get_huge_pages() can be used for the direct
allocation of hugepage- backed regions.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, libhugetlbfs will use the
default hugepage size to back memory regions. The default
size is the value of Hugepage- size displayed in
/proc/meminfo. The size can be specified in bytes or in
kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes by appending K, M, or G
respec- tively. It is an error to specify a invalid,
unsupported, or otherwise unconfigured huge page size.
Kernel 2.6.27 or later is required to specify any pagesize
other than the default.</p>

<p>See /usr/share/docs/libhugetlbfs/HOWTO for detailed
instructions on how the library should be used, particularly
when relinking the applica- tion. This manual page provides
a brief synopsis of the environment variables as a quick
reference.</p>

<p>The following variables affect what memory regions are
backed by hugepages. In all cases, the environment being
unset implies the fea- ture should remain disabled.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=&lt;pagesize&gt; This sets the
default hugepage size to be used by libhugetlbfs. If not
set, libhugetlbfs will use the kernels default hugepage
size.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_MORECORE=[yes|&lt;pagesize&gt;] This enables the
hugepage malloc() feature, instructing lib- hugetlbfs to
override glibc s normal morecore() function with a hugepage
version and use it for malloc(). All application mal- loc()
memory should come from hugepage memory until it runs out,
it will then fallback to base pages. Note that applications
that use custom allocators may not be able to back their
heaps using hugepages and this environment variable. It may
be neces- sary to modify the custom allocator to use
get_huge_pages().</p>

<p>HUGETLB_SHM=yes When this environment variable is set,
the SHM_HUGETLB flag is added to the shmget() call and the
size parameter is aligned to back the shared memory segment
with hugepages. In the event hugepages cannot be used, base
pages will be used instead and a warning will be printed to
explain the failure. The pagesize cannot be specified with
this parameter. To change the kernels default hugepage size,
use the pagesize= kernel boot parameter (2.6.26 or later
required).</p>


<p>HUGETLB_ELFMAP=[no|[R[&lt;=pagesize&gt;]:[W[&lt;=pagesize&gt;]]]
If the application has been relinked (see the HOWTO for
instruc- tions), this environment variable determines
whether read-only, read-write, both or no segments are
backed by hugepages and what pagesize should be used. If the
recommended relinking method has been used, then hugeedit
can be used to automatically back the text or data by
default.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_FORCE_ELFMAP=yes Force the use of hugepages for
text and data segments even if the application has not been
relinked to align the ELF segments on a hugepage boundary.
Partial segment remapping is not guar- anteed to work and
the segments must be large enough to contain at least one
hugepage for the remapping to occur.</p>

<p>The following options affect how libhugetlbfs
behaves.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE=e1:e2:...:eN By default,
libhugetlbfs will act on any program that it is loaded with,
either via LD_PRELOAD or by explicitly linking with
-lhugetlbfs.</p>

<p>There are situations in which it is desirable to
restrict lib- hugetlbfs actions to specific programs. For
example, some ISV applications are wrapped in a series of
scripts that invoke bash, python, and/or perl. It is more
convenient to set the environment variables related to
libhugetlbfs before invoking the wrapper scripts, yet this
has the unintended and undesirable consequence of causing
the script interpreters to use and con- sume hugepages.
There is no obvious benefit to causing the script
interpreters to use hugepages, and there is a clear dis-
advantage: fewer hugepages are available to the actual
applica- tion.</p>

<p>To address this scenario, set HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE to a
colon- separated list of programs to which the other
libhugetlbfs envi- ronment variables should apply. (If not
set, libhugetlbfs will attempt to apply the requested
actions to all programs.) For example,</p>

<p>HUGETLB_RESTRICT_EXE=hpcc:long_hpcc</p>

<p>will restrict libhugetlbfs actions to programs named
/home/fred/hpcc and /bench/long_hpcc but not
/bin/hpcc_no.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_MORECORE_SHRINK=yes By default, the hugepage
heap does not shrink. Shrinking is enabled by setting this
environment variable. It is disabled by default as glibc
occasionally exhibits strange behaviour if it mistakes the
heap returned by libhugetlbfs as a foreign brk().</p>

<p>HUGETLB_NO_PREFAULT By default libhugetlbfs will
prefault regions it creates to ensure they can be referenced
without receiving a SIGKILL. On kernels older than 2.6.27,
this was necessary as the system did not guarantee that
future faults would succeed on regions mapped MAP_PRIVATE.
Prefaulting impacts the performance of malloc() and can
result in poor placement on NUMA systems. If it is known the
hugepage pool is large enough to run the application or the
kernel is 2.6.27 or later, this environment variable should
be set.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_NO_RESERVE=yes</p>

<p>By default, the kernel will reserve huge pages at mmap()
time to ensure that future faults will succeed. This avoids
unexpected application failure at fault time but some
applications depend on memory overcommit to create large
sparse mappings. For this type of application, setting this
environment variable will cre- ate huge page backed mappings
without a reservation. Use this option with extreme care as
in the event huge pages are not available when the mapping
is used, the application will be killed. On older kernels,
the use of this feature can trigger the OOM killer. Hence,
even with this variable set, reservations may still be used
for safety.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_MORECORE_HEAPBASE=address libhugetlbfs normally
picks an address to use as the base of the heap for malloc()
automatically. This environment variable fixes which address
is used.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_PATH=&lt;path&gt; The path to the hugetlbfs
mount is automatically determined at run-time. In the event
there are multiple mounts and the wrong one is being
selected, use this option to select the correct one. This
may be the case if an application-specific mount with a
fixed quota has been created for example.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_SHARE=1 By default, libhugetlbfs uses unlinked
hugetlbfs files to store remapped program segment data. If
the same program is started multiple times using hugepage
segments, multiple hugepages will be used to store the same
program data. The reduce this wastage, setting this
environment variable will share read-only segments between
multiple invocations of a program at the cost of the memory
being used whether the applications are running or not. It
is also possible that a malicious application inferfere with
other applications executable code. See the HOWTO for more
detailed information on this topic.</p>

<p>The following options control the verbosity of
libhugetlbfs.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_VERBOSE=&lt;level&gt; The default value for this
is 1 and the range of the value is from 0 to 99. The higher
the value, the more verbose the output is. 0 is quiet and 3
will output much debugging information.</p>

<p>HUGETLB_DEBUG Once set, this will give very detailed
output on what is happen- ing in the library and run extra
diagnostics.</p>
