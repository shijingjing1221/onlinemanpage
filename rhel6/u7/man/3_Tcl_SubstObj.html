<p>NAME Tcl_SubstObj - perform substitutions on Tcl
objects</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj * Tcl_SubstObj(interp, objPtr, flags)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter in which
to execute Tcl scripts and lookup variables. If an error
occurs, the interpreters result is modified to hold an error
message.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in) A Tcl object containing the string
to perform substitutions on.</p>

<p>int flags (in) ORed combination of flag bits that
specify which substitutions to per- form. The flags
TCL_SUBST_COMMANDS, TCL_SUBST_VARIABLES and
TCL_SUBST_BACKSLASHES are currently supported, and
TCL_SUBST_ALL is pro- vided as a convenience for the com-
mon case where all substitutions are desired.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Tcl_SubstObj function is used to perform
substitutions on strings in the fashion of the subst
command. It gets the value of the string contained in objPtr
and scans it, copying characters and performing the chosen
substitutions as it goes to an output object which is
returned as the result of the function. In the event of an
error occurring dur- ing the execution of a command or
variable substitution, the function returns NULL and an
error message is left in interps result.</p>

<p>Three kinds of substitutions are supported. When the
TCL_SUBST_BACK- SLASHES bit is set in flags, sequences that
look like backslash substi- tutions for Tcl commands are
replaced by their corresponding character.</p>

<p>When the TCL_SUBST_VARIABLES bit is set in flags,
sequences that look like variable substitutions for Tcl
commands are replaced by the con- tents of the named
variable.</p>

<p>When the TCL_SUBST_COMMANDS bit is set in flags,
sequences that look like command substitutions for Tcl
commands are replaced by the result of evaluating that
script. Where an uncaught continue exception occurs during
the evaluation of a command substitution, an empty string is
substituted for the command. Where an uncaught break
exception occurs during the evaluation of a command
substitution, the result of the whole substitution on objPtr
will be truncated at the point immedi- ately before the
start of the command substitution, and no characters will be
added to the result or substitutions performed after that
point.</p>
