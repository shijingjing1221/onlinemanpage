<p>NAME mrtg-contrib - Contribution Guidelines for MRTG</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If you have written an extension to mrtg or
created a bug fix, please consider contributing it to the
project. As I get quite a number of contributions every
week, here are a few guidelines which explain how to
contribute so that I can use the contribution without too
much addi- tional work.</p>

<p>Translations</p>

<p>MRTG messages have been translated to a number of
languages but there are still many which have not been
covered yet. If you want to add yours, go into the
mrtg-2.16.2/translate directory and follow the instructions
given in the README file.</p>

<p>Patches</p>

<p>When you have created your modification or extension to
mrtg and want to submit it to me, please crate a patch for
the files which you have modified. Do not send entire files
unless they are new.</p>

<p>To create a patch, get hold of a copy of GNU diff (Many
Unix systems will have this installed already. In the NT
world you might want to get
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/ to get all the nice GNU
tools avail- able.) and type</p>

<p>diff --unified --ignore-space-change old-file new-file
&gt; simple.patch</p>

<p>or if you have modified several files do</p>

<p>diff --recursive --unified --ignore-space-change
old-dir/ new-dir/ &gt;long.patch</p>

<p>Documentation</p>

<p>All documentation of mrtg is done with the perl POD
system. If you want to learn about it, type</p>

<p>perldoc perlpod</p>

<p>and read the instructions. If you have bugfixes or
additions to the existing documents, make sure you modify
the POD files and not the html or txt versions.</p>

<p>I take documentation very seriously. Whenever you create
a new feature for mrtg which you want to get included in the
official release, your patch must also contain modifications
for the relevant pod file in the doc tree or for the
documentation sections of cfgmaker and indexmaker.</p>

contributions to Tobias Oetiker &lt;tobi@oetiker.ch&gt;</p>
