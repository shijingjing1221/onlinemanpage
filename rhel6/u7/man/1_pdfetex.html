<p>PDFETEX(1) Web2C 7.5.6 PDFETEX(1)</p>

<p>NAME pdfetex, pdfeinitex, pdfevirtex - PDF output from
e-TeX</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pdfetex [options] [&amp; format ] [ file |
commands ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run the pdfeTeX typesetter on file, usually
creating file.pdf. If the file argument has no extension,
&quot;.tex&quot; will be appended to it. Instead of a
filename, a set of pdfeTeX commands can be given, the first
of which must start with a backslash. With a &amp;format
argument pdfeTeX uses a different set of precompiled
commands, contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to
use the -fmt format option instead.</p>

<p>pdfeTeX is a version of e-TeX that can create PDF files
as well as DVI files.</p>

<p>In DVI mode, pdfeTeX can be used as a complete
replacement of the e-TeX engine.</p>

<p>The typical use of pdfeTeX is with a pregenerated
formats for which PDF output has been enabled. The pdfetex
command uses the equivalent of the plain e-TeX format, and
the pdfelatex command uses the equivalent of the e-LaTeX
format. To generate formats, use the -ini switch.</p>

<p>The pdfeinitex and pdfevirtex commands are pdfeTeX s
analogues to the einitex and evirtex commands. In this
installation, they are symbolic links to the pdfetex
executable. These symbolic links may not exist at all.</p>

<p>In PDF mode, pdfeTeX can natively handle the PDF, JPG,
JBIG2, and PNG graphics formats. pdfeTeX cannot include
PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphics files;
first convert them to PDF using epstopdf(1). pdfeTeX s
handling of its command-line arguments is simi- lar to that
of of the other TeX programs in the web2c
implementation.</p>

<p>OPTIONS This version of pdfeTeX understands the
following command line options.</p>

<p>-draftmode Sets dfdraftmode so pdfTeX doesnt write a PDF
and doesnt read any included images, thus speeding up
execution.</p>

<p>-enc Enable the encTeX extensions. This option is only
effective in combination with</p>

<p>-etex Enable the e-TeX extensions. This option is only
effective in combination with -ini. See etex(1).</p>

<p>-ini. For documentation of the encTeX extensions see
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html. -file-line-error Print
error messages in the form file:line:error which is similar
to the way many compilers format them.</p>

<p>-no-file-line-error Disable printing error messages in
the file:line:error style.</p>

<p>-file-line-error-style This is the old name of the
-file-line-error option.</p>

<p>-fmt format Use format as the name of the format to be
used, instead of the name by which pdfeTeX was called or a
%&amp; line.</p>

<p>-halt-on-error Exit with an error code when an error is
encountered during pro- cessing.</p>

<p>-help Print help message and exit.</p>

<p>-ini Start in INI mode, which is used to dump formats.
The INI mode can be used for typesetting, but no format is
preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes
may be required.</p>

<p>-interaction mode Sets the interaction mode. The mode
can be either batchmode, nonstopmode, scrollmode, and
errorstopmode. The meaning of these modes is the same as
that of the corresponding -ipc Send DVI or PDF output to a
socket as well as the usual output file. Whether this option
is available is the choice of the installer.</p>

<p>-ipc-start As -ipc, and starts the server at the other
end as well. Whether this option is available is the choice
of the installer.</p>

<p>-jobname name Use name for the job name, instead of
deriving it from the name of the input file.</p>

<p>-kpathsea-debug bitmask Sets path searching debugging
flags according to the bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for
details.</p>

<p>-mktex fmt Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex
or tfm.</p>

<p>-mltex Enable MLTeX extensions. Only effective in
combination with -ini.</p>

<p>-no-mktex fmt Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either
tex or tfm.</p>

<p>-output-comment string In DVI mode, use string for the
DVI file comment instead of the date. This option is ignored
in PDF mode.</p>

<p>-output-directory directory directory instead of the
current directory. Look up input files in directory first,
the along the normal search path.</p>

<p>-output-format format Set the output format mode, where
format must be either pdf or dvi. This also influences the
set of graphics formats under- stood by pdfeTeX.</p>

<p>-parse-first-line If the first line of the main input
file begins with %&amp; parse it to look for a dump name or
a -translate-file option.</p>

<p>-no-parse-first-line Disable parsing of the first line
of the main input file.</p>

<p>-progname name Pretend to be program name. This affects
both the format used and the search paths.</p>

<p>-recorder Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a
trace of the files opened for input and output in a file
with extension .fls.</p>

<p>-shell-escape Enable the48rite18{command} construct. The
command can be any shell command. This construct is normally
disallowed for secu- rity reasons.</p>

<p>-no-shell-escape Disable the48rite18{command} construct,
even if it is enabled in the texmf.cnf file.</p>

<p>-src-specials In DVI mode, insert source specials into
the DVI file. This option is ignored in PDF mode.</p>

<p>-src-specials where In DVI mode, insert source specials
in certain placed of the DVI file. where is a
comma-separated value list: cr, display, hbox, math, par,
parent, or vbox. This option is ignored in PDF mode.</p>

<p>-translate-file tcxname Use the tcxname translation
table to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping
of output characters.</p>

<p>-default-translate-file tcxname Like -translate-file
except that a %&amp; line can overrule this setting.</p>

<p>-version Print version information and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT See the Kpathsearch library documentation
(the Path specifications node) for precise details of how
the environment variables are used. The kpsewhich utility
can be used to query the values of the variables.</p>

<p>One caveat: In most pdfeTeX formats, you cannot use ~ in
a filename you give directly to pdfeTeX, because ~ is an
active character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part
of the filename. Other programs, such as Metafont, do not
have this problem.</p>

<p>TEXMFOUTPUT Normally, pdfeTeX puts its output files in
the current direc- tory. If any output file cannot be opened
there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in the
environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT. There is no default value
for that variable. For example, if you say pdfetex paper and
the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has
the value /tmp, pdfeTeX attempts to create /tmp/paper.log
(and /tmp/paper.pdf, if any output is produced.)</p>

<p>TEXINPUTS Search path for input and openin files. This
should probably start with . , so that user files are found
before system files. An empty path component will be
replaced with the paths defined in the texmf.cnf file. For
example, set TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/usr/tex:&quot; to
prepend the current direcory and /home/user/tex to the
standard search path.</p>

<p>TEXFORMATS Search path for format files.</p>

<p>TEXPOOL search path for pdfetex internal strings.</p>

<p>TEXEDIT Command template for switching to editor. The
default, usually vi, is set when pdfeTeX is compiled.</p>

<p>TFMFONTS Search path for font metric (.tfm) files.</p>

<p>FILES The location of the files mentioned below varies
from system to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find
their locations.</p>

<p>pdfetex.pool Text file containing pdfeTeXs internal
strings.</p>

<p>pdftex.map Filename mapping definitions.</p>

<p>*.tfm Metric files for pdfeTeXs fonts.</p>

<p>*.fmt Predigested pdfeTeX format (.fmt) files.</p>

<p>NOTES Starting with version 1.40, pdfTeX incorporates
the e-TeX extensions, and pdfeTeX is just a copy of pdfTeX.
See pdftex(1). This manual page is not meant to be
exhaustive. The complete documentation for this version of
pdfeTeX can be found in the pdfTeX manual and the info man-
ual Web2C: A TeX implementation.</p>

<p>BUGS This version of pdfeTeX implements a number of
optional extensions. In fact, many of these extensions
conflict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition
of pdfeTeX. When such extensions are enabled, the banner
printed when pdfeTeX starts is changed to print pdfeTeXk
instead of pdfeTeX.</p>

<p>This version of pdfeTeX fails to trap arithmetic
overflow when dimen- sions are added or subtracted. Cases
where this occurs are rare, but when it does the generated
DVI file will be invalid. Whether a gener- ated PDF file
would be usable is unknown.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY pdfeTeX is available for a large variety of
machine architectures and operation systems. pdfeTeX is part
of all major TeX distributions.</p>

<p>Information on how to get pdfeTeX and related
information is available at the http://www.pdftex.org pdfTeX
website.</p>

<p>AUTHORS The primary authors of pdfeTeX are Han The
Thanh, Petr Sojka, Jiri Zla- tuska, and Peter Breitenlohner
(eTeX).</p>

<p>TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it
using his sys- tem for Pascal programs. It was ported to
Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel
Curtis. The version now offered with the Unix TeX
distribution is that generated by the to C system (web2c),
originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.</p>

<p>The encTeX extensions were written by Petr Olsak.</p>
