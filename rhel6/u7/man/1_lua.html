<p>NAME lua - Lua interpreter</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lua [ options ] [ script [ args ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lua is the stand-alone Lua interpreter. It
loads and executes Lua pro- grams, either in textual source
form or in precompiled binary form. (Precompiled binaries
are output by luac, the Lua compiler.) lua can be used as a
batch interpreter and also interactively.</p>

<p>The given options (see below) are executed and then the
Lua program in file script is loaded and executed. The given
args are available to script as strings in a global table
named arg. If these arguments con- tain spaces or other
characters special to the shell, then they should be quoted
(but note that the quotes will be removed by the shell). The
arguments in arg start at 0, which contains the string
script. The index of the last argument is stored in arg.n.
The arguments given in the command line before script,
including the name of the interpreter, are available in
negative indices in arg.</p>

<p>At the very start, before even handling the command
line, lua executes the contents of the environment variable
LUA_INIT, if it is defined. If the value of LUA_INIT is of
the form @filename, then filename is executed. Otherwise,
the string is assumed to be a Lua statement and is
executed.</p>

<p>Options start with-and are described below. You can use
-- to signal the end of options.</p>

<p>If no arguments are given, then -v -i is assumed when
the standard input is a terminal; otherwise, - is
assumed.</p>

<p>In interactive mode, lua prompts the user, reads lines
from the stan- dard input, and executes them as they are
read. If a line does not contain a complete statement, then
a secondary prompt is displayed and lines are read until a
complete statement is formed or a syntax error is found. So,
one way to interrupt the reading of an incomplete state-
ment is to force a syntax error: adding a;in the middle of a
state- ment is a sure way of forcing a syntax error (except
inside multiline strings and comments; these must be closed
explicitly). If a line starts with = , then lua displays the
values of all the expressions in the remainder of the line.
The expressions must be separated by commas. The primary
prompt is the value of the global variable _PROMPT, if this
value is a string; otherwise, the default prompt is used.
Similarly, the secondary prompt is the value of the global
variable _PROMPT2. So, to change the prompts, set the
corresponding variable to a string of your choice. You can
do that after calling the interpreter or on the command line
(but in this case you have to be careful with quotes if the
prompt string contains a space; otherwise you may confuse
the shell.) The default prompts are &quot;&gt; &quot; and
&quot;&gt;&gt; &quot;.</p>

<p>OPTIONS - load and execute the standard input as a file,
that is, not interactively, even when the standard input is
a terminal.</p>

<p>-e stat execute statement stat. You need to quote stat
if it contains spaces, quotes, or other characters special
to the shell.</p>

<p>-i enter interactive mode after script is executed.</p>

<p>-l name call require( name ) before executing script.
Typically used to load libraries.</p>

<p>-v show version information.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Error messages should be self
explanatory.</p>
