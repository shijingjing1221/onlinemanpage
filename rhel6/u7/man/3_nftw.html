<p>NAME ftw, nftw - file tree walk</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;ftw.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ftw(const char *dirpath, int (*fn) (const char
*fpath, const struct stat *sb, int typeflag), int
nopenfd);</p>

<p>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500 #include &lt;ftw.h&gt;</p>

<p>int nftw(const char *dirpath, int (*fn) (const char
*fpath, const struct stat *sb, int typeflag, struct FTW
*ftwbuf), int nopenfd, int flags);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ftw() walks through the directory tree that
is located under the direc- tory dirpath, and calls fn()
once for each entry in the tree. By default, directories are
handled before the files and subdirectories they contain
(pre-order traversal).</p>

<p>To avoid using up all of the calling processs file
descriptors, nopenfd specifies the maximum number of
directories that ftw() will hold open simultaneously. When
the search depth exceeds this, ftw() will become slower
because directories have to be closed and reopened. ftw()
uses at most one file descriptor for each level in the
directory tree.</p>

<p>For each entry found in the tree, ftw() calls fn() with
three argu- ments: fpath, sb, and typeflag. fpath is the
pathname of the entry relative to dirpath. sb is a pointer
to the stat structure returned by a call to stat(2) for
fpath. typeflag is an integer that has one of the following
values:</p>

<p>FTW_F fpath is a regular file.</p>

<p>FTW_D fpath is a directory.</p>

<p>FTW_DNR fpath is a directory which cant be read.</p>

<p>FTW_NS The stat(2) call failed on fpath, which is not a
symbolic link.</p>

<p>If fpath is a symbolic link and stat(2) failed,
POSIX.1-2001 states that it is undefined whether FTW_NS or
FTW_SL (see below) is passed in typeflag.</p>

<p>To stop the tree walk, fn() returns a non-zero value;
this value will become the return value of ftw(). As long as
fn() returns 0, ftw() will continue either until it has
traversed the entire tree, in which case it will return
zero, or until it encounters an error (such as a malloc(3)
failure), in which case it will return -1.</p>

<p>Because ftw() uses dynamic data structures, the only
safe way to exit out of a tree walk is to return a non-zero
value from fn(). To allow a signal to terminate the walk
without causing a memory leak, have the handler set a global
flag that is checked by fn(). Dont use longjmp(3) unless the
program is going to terminate.</p>

<p>nftw() The function nftw() is the same as ftw(), except
that it has one addi- tional argument, flags, and calls fn()
with one more argument, ftwbuf.</p>

<p>This flags argument is formed by ORing zero or more of
the following flags:</p>

<p>FTW_ACTIONRETVAL (since glibc 2.3.3) If this
glibc-specific flag is set, then nftw() handles the return
value from fn() differently. fn() should return one of the
following values:</p>

<p>FTW_CONTINUE Instructs nftw() to continue normally.</p>

<p>FTW_SKIP_SIBLINGS If fn() returns this value, then
siblings of the current entry will be skipped, and
processing continues in the parent.</p>

<p>FTW_SKIP_SUBTREE If fn() is called with an entry that is
a directory (typeflag is FTW_D), this return value will
prevent objects within that directory from being passed as
argu- ments to fn(). nftw() continues processing with the
next sibling of the directory.</p>

<p>FTW_STOP Causes nftw() to return immediately with the
return value FTW_STOP.</p>

<p>Other return values could be associated with new actions
in the future; fn() should not return values other than
those listed above.</p>

<p>The feature test macro _GNU_SOURCE must be defined in
order to obtain the definition of FTW_ACTIONRETVAL from
&lt;ftw.h&gt;.</p>

<p>FTW_CHDIR If set, do a chdir(2) to each directory before
handling its con- tents. This is useful if the program needs
to perform some action in the directory in which fpath
resides.</p>

<p>FTW_DEPTH If set, do a post-order traversal, that is,
call fn() for the directory itself after handling the
contents of the directory and its subdirectories. (By
default, each directory is handled before its contents.)</p>

<p>FTW_MOUNT If set, stay within the same file system
(i.e., do not cross mount points).</p>

<p>FTW_PHYS If set, do not follow symbolic links. (This is
what you want.) If not set, symbolic links are followed, but
no file is reported twice.</p>

<p>If FTW_PHYS is not set, but FTW_DEPTH is set, then the
function fn() is never called for a directory that would be
a descendant of itself.</p>

<p>For each entry in the directory tree, nftw() calls fn()
with four argu- ments. fpath and sb are as for ftw().
typeflag may receive any of the same values as with ftw(),
or any of the following values:</p>

<p>FTW_DP fpath is a directory, and FTW_DEPTH was specified
in flags. All of the files and subdirectories within fpath
have been pro- cessed.</p>

<p>FTW_SL fpath is a symbolic link, and FTW_PHYS was set in
flags.</p>

<p>FTW_SLN fpath is a symbolic link pointing to a
nonexistent file. (This occurs only if FTW_PHYS is not
set.)</p>

<p>The fourth argument that nftw() supplies when calling
fn() is a struc- ture of type FTW:</p>

<p>struct FTW { int base; int level; };</p>

<p>base is the offset of the filename (i.e., basename
component) in the pathname given in fpath. level is the
depth of fpath in the directory tree, relative to the root
of the tree (dirpath, which has depth 0).</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE These functions return 0 on success, and -1
if an error occurs.</p>

<p>If fn() returns non-zero, then the tree walk is
terminated and the value returned by fn() is returned as the
result of ftw() or nftw().</p>

<p>If nftw() is called with the FTW_ACTIONRETVAL flag, then
the only non- zero value that should be used by fn() to
terminate the tree walk is FTW_STOP, and that value is
returned as the result of nftw().</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001, SVr4, SUSv1. POSIX.1-2008
marks ftw() as obsolete.</p>

<p>NOTES The function nftw() and the use of FTW_SL with
ftw() were introduced in SUSv1.</p>

<p>On some systems ftw() will never use FTW_SL, on other
systems FTW_SL occurs only for symbolic links that do not
point to an existing file, and again on other systems ftw()
will use FTW_SL for each symbolic link. For predictable
control, use nftw().</p>

<p>Under Linux, libc4 and libc5 and glibc 2.0.6 will use
FTW_F for all objects (files, symbolic links, FIFOs, etc.)
that can be stated but are not a directory.</p>

<p>The function nftw() is available since glibc 2.1.</p>

<p>FTW_ACTIONRETVAL is glibc-specific.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following program traverses the directory
tree under the path named in its first command-line
argument, or under the current directory if no argument is
supplied. It displays various information about each file.
The second command-line argument can be used to specify
charac- ters that control the value assigned to the flags
argument when calling nftw().</p>
