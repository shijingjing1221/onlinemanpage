<p>NAME sandbox - Run cmd under an SELinux sandbox</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sandbox [-C] [ -d DPI ] [-l level ] [[-M | -X]
-H homedir -T tempdir ] [-I includefile ] [ -W windowmanager
] [ -w windowsize ] [[-i file ]...] [ -t type ] cmd</p>

<p>sandbox [-C] [ -d DPI ] [-l level ] [[-M | -X] -H
homedir -T tempdir ] [-I includefile ] [ -W windowmanager ]
[ -w windowsize ] [[-i file ]...] [ -t type ] -S</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Run the cmd application within a tightly
confined SELinux domain. The default sandbox domain only
allows applications the ability to read and write stdin,
stdout and any other file descriptors handed to it. It is
not allowed to open any other files. The -M option will
mount an alternate homedir and tmpdir to be used by the
sandbox.</p>

<p>If you have the policycoreutils-sandbox package
installed, you can use the -X option and the -M option.
sandbox -X allows you to run X appli- cations within a
sandbox. These applications will start up their own X Server
and create a temporary home directory and /tmp. The default
SELinux policy does not allow any capabilities or network
access. It also prevents all access to the users other
processes and files. Files specified on the command that are
in the home directory or /tmp will be copied into the
sandbox directories.</p>

<p>If directories are specified with -H or -T the directory
will have its context modified with chcon(1) unless a level
is specified with -l. If the MLS/MCS security level is
specified, the user is responsible to set the correct
labels.</p>

<p>-H --homedir Use alternate homedir to mount over your
home directory. Defaults to temporary. Requires -X or
-M.</p>

<p>-i, --include Copy this file into the appropriate
temporary sandbox directory. Command can be repeated.</p>

<p>-I, --includefile Copy all files listed in inputfile
into the appropriate tempo- rary sandbox directories.</p>

<p>-l, --level Specify the MLS/MCS Security Level to run
the sandbox with. Defaults to random.</p>

<p>-M, --mount Create a Sandbox with temporary files for
$HOME and /tmp.</p>

<p>-t, --type Use alternate sandbox type, defaults to
sandbox_t or sandbox_x_t for -X.</p>

<p>-T, --tmpdir Use alternate tempory directory to mount on
/tmp. Defaults to tmpfs. Requires -X or -M.</p>

<p>-S, --session Run a full desktop session, Requires
level, and home and tmpdir.</p>

<p>-w, --windowsize Specifies the windowsize when creating
an X based Sandbox. The default windowsize is 1000x700.</p>

<p>-W, --windowmanager Select alternative window manager to
run within sandbox -X. Default to
/usr/bin/matchbox-window-manager.</p>

<p>-X Create an X based Sandbox for gui apps, temporary
files for $HOME and /tmp, secondary Xserver, defaults to
sandbox_x_t</p>

<p>-d, --dpi Set the DPI value for the sanbox X Server.
Defaults to the cur- rent X Sever DPI.</p>

<p>-C, --capabilities Use capabilities within the sandbox.
By default applications executed within the sandbox will not
be allowed to use capabili- ties (setuid apps), with the -C
flag, you can use programs requiring capabilities.</p>
