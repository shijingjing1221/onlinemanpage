<p>DESCRIPTION The panedwindow command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argument) and makes it into a
panedwindow widget. Additional options, described above, may
be specified on the command line or in the option database
to configure aspects of the panedwindow such as its default
background color and relief. The panedwindow command returns
the path name of the new window.</p>

<p>A panedwindow widget contains any number of panes,
arranged horizon- tally or vertically, according to the
value of the -orient option. Each pane contains one widget,
and each pair of panes is separated by a moveable (via mouse
movements) sash. Moving a sash causes the widgets on either
side of the sash to be resized.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The panedwindow command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is the same as the path name of the
panedwindow s window. This command may be used to invoke
various operations on the widget. It has the following
general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? PathName is the
name of the command, which is the same as the panedwin- dow
widgets path name. Option and the args determine the exact
behav- ior of the command. The following commands are
possible for panedwin- dow widgets:</p>

<p>pathName add window ?window ...? ?option value ...? Add
one or more windows to the panedwindow, each in a separate
pane. The arguments consist of the names of one or more
windows followed by pairs of arguments that specify how to
manage the windows. Option may have any of the values
accepted by the con- figure subcommand.</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the panedwindow command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the panedwindow command.</p>

<p>pathName forget window ?window ...? Remove the pane
containing window from the panedwindow. All geometry
management options for window will be forgotten.</p>

<p>pathName identify x y Identify the panedwindow component
underneath the point given by x and y, in window
coordinates. If the point is over a sash or a sash handle,
the result is a two element list containing the index of the
sash or handle, and a word indicating whether it is over a
sash or a handle, such as {0 sash} or {2 handle}. If the
point is over any other part of the panedwindow, the result
is an empty list.</p>

<p>pathName proxy ?args? This command is used to query and
change the position of the sash proxy, used for
rubberband-style pane resizing. It can take any of the
following forms:</p>

<p>pathName proxy coord Return a list containing the x and
y coordinates of the most recent proxy location.</p>

<p>pathName proxy forget Remove the proxy from the
display.</p>

<p>pathName proxy place x y Place the proxy at the given x
and y coordinates.</p>

<p>pathName sash ?args? This command is used to query and
change the position of sashes in the panedwindow. It can
take any of the following forms:</p>

<p>pathName sash coord index Return the current x and y
coordinate pair for the sash given by index. Index must be
an integer between 0 and 1 less than the number of panes in
the panedwindow. The coordinates given are those of the top
left corner of the region containing the sash.</p>

<p>pathName sash dragto index x y This command computes the
difference between the given coordinates and the coordinates
given to the last sash mark command for the given sash. It
then moves that sash the computed difference. The return
value is the empty string.</p>

<p>pathName sash mark index x y Records x and y for the
sash given by index; used in con- junction with later sash
dragto commands to move the sash.</p>

<p>pathName sash place index x y Place the sash given by
index at the given coordinates.</p>

<p>pathName panecget window option Query a management
option for window. Option may be any value allowed by the
paneconfigure subcommand.</p>

<p>pathName paneconfigure window ?option? ?value option
value ...? Query or modify the management options for
window. If no option is specified, returns a list describing
all of the available options for pathName (see
Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of this
list). If option is specified with no value, then the
command returns a list describing the one named option (this
list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
value returned if no option is specified). If one or more
option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies
the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns an empty string. The following
options are supported:</p>

<p>-after window Insert the window after the window
specified. window should be the name of a window already
managed by path- Name.</p>

<p>-before window Insert the window before the window
specified. window should be the name of a window already
managed by path- Name.</p>

<p>-height size Specify a height for the window. The height
will be the outer dimension of the window including its
border, if any. If size is an empty string, or if -height is
not specified, then the height requested internally by the
window will be used initially; the height may later be
adjusted by the movement of sashes in the panedwindow. Size
may be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>-hide boolean Controls the visibility of a pane. When
the boolean is true (according to Tcl_GetBoolean) the pane
will not be visible, but it will still be maintained in the
list of panes.</p>

<p>-minsize n Specifies that the size of the window cannot
be made less than n. This constraint only affects the size
of the widget in the paned dimension the x dimension for
hori- zontal panedwindows, the y dimension for vertical
paned- windows. May be any value accepted by
Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>-padx n Specifies a non-negative value indicating how
much extra space to leave on each side of the window in the
X-direc- tion. The value may have any of the forms accepted
by Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>-pady n Specifies a non-negative value indicating how
much extra space to leave on each side of the window in the
Y-direc- tion. The value may have any of the forms accepted
by Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>-sticky style If a window s pane is larger than the
requested dimen- sions of the window, this option may be
used to position (or stretch) the window within its pane.
Style is a string that contains zero or more of the
characters n, s, e or w. The string can optionally contains
spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each letter refers
to a side (north, south, east, or west) that the window will
stick to. If both n and s (or e and w) are specified, the
window will be stretched to fill the entire height (or
width) of its cavity.</p>

<p>-stretch when Controls how extra space is allocated to
each of the panes. When is one of always, first, last,
middle, and never. The panedwindow will calculate the
required size of all its panes. Any remaining (or deficit)
space will be distributed to those panes marked for
stretching. The space will be distributed based on each
panes current ratio of the whole. The when values have the
following definition:</p>

<p>always This pane will always stretch.</p>

<p>first Only if this pane is the first pane (left-most or
top-most) will it stretch.</p>

<p>last Only if this pane is the last pane (right-most or
bottom-most) will it stretch. This is the default value.</p>

<p>mid- dle Only if this pane is not the first or last pane
will it stretch.</p>

<p>never This pane will never stretch.</p>

<p>-width size Specify a width for the window. The width
will be the outer dimension of the window including its
border, if any. If size is an empty string, or if -width is
not specified, then the width requested internally by the
window will be used initially; the width may later be
adjusted by the movement of sashes in the panedwindow. Size
may be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.</p>

<p>pathName panes Returns an ordered list of the widgets
managed by pathName.</p>

<p>RESIZING PANES A pane is resized by grabbing the sash
(or sash handle if present) and dragging with the mouse.
This is accomplished via mouse motion bind- ings on the
widget. When a sash is moved, the sizes of the panes on each
side of the sash, and thus the widgets in those panes, are
adjusted.</p>

<p>When a pane is resized from outside (e.g. it is packed
to expand and fill, and the containing toplevel is resized),
space is added to the final (rightmost or bottommost) pane
in the window.</p>
