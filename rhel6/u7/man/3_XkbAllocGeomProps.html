<p>XkbAllocGeomProps(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbAllocGeomProps(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAllocGeomProps - Allocate geometry
properties</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Status XkbAllocGeomProps (XkbGeometryPtr geom,
int num_needed);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - geom _summary_</p>

<p>- num_needed _summary_</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xkb provides a number of functions to
allocate and free subcomponents of a keyboard geometry. Use
these functions to create or modify key- board geometries.
Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new
element(s), and it is up to you to fill in the values
explic- itly in your code. These allocation functions
increase sz_* but never touch num_* (unless there is an
allocation failure, in which case they reset both sz_* and
num_* to zero). These functions return Success if they
succeed, BadAlloc if they are not able to allocate space, or
Bad- Value if a parameter is not as expected.</p>

<p>XkbAllocGeomProps allocates space for num_needed
properties and adds them to the specified geometry geom. No
initialization of the proper- ties is done. A geometry
property associates an arbitrary string with an equally
arbitrary name. Geometry properties can be used to provide
hints to programs that display images of keyboards, but they
are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures
refer to geometry properties.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc Unable to allocate storage</p>

<p>BadValue An argument is out of range</p>
