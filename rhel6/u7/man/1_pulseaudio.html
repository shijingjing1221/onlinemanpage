<p>DESCRIPTION PulseAudio is a networked low-latency sound
server for Linux, POSIX and Windows systems.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h | --help Show help.</p>

<p>--version Show version information.</p>

<p>--dump-conf Load the daemon configuration file
daemon.conf (see below), parse remaining configuration
options on the command line and dump the resulting daemon
configuration, in a format that is compatible with
daemon.conf.</p>

<p>--dump-modules List available loadable modules. Combine
with -v for a more elaborate listing.</p>

<p>--dump-resample-methods List available audio
resamplers.</p>

<p>--cleanup-shm Identify stale PulseAudio POSIX shared
memory segments in /dev/shm and remove them if possible.
This is done implicitly whenever a new daemon starts up or a
client tries to connect to a daemon. It should normally not
be necessary to issue this com- mand by hand. Only available
on systems with POSIX shared memory segments implemented via
a virtual file system mounted to /dev/shm (e.g. Linux).</p>

<p>--start Start PulseAudio if it is not running yet. This
is different from starting PulseAudio without --start which
would fail if PA is already running. PulseAudio is
guaranteed to be fully ini- tialized when this call returns.
Implies --daemon.</p>

<p>-k | --kill Kill an already running PulseAudio daemon of
the calling user (Equivalent to sending a SIGTERM).</p>

<p>--check Return 0 as return code when the PulseAudio
daemon is already running for the calling user, or non-zero
otherwise. Produces no output on the console except for
errors to stderr.</p>

<p>--system[=BOOL] Run as system-wide instance instead of
per-user. Please note that this disables certain features of
PulseAudio and is gener- ally not recommended unless the
system knows no local users (e.g. is a thin client). This
feature needs special configura- tion and a dedicated UNIX
user set up. It is highly recommended to combine this with
--disallow-module-loading (see below).</p>

<p>-D | --daemonize[=BOOL] Daemonize after startup, i.e.
detach from the terminal.</p>

<p>--fail[=BOOL] Fail startup when any of the commands
specified in the startup script default.pa (see below)
fails.</p>

<p>--high-priority[=BOOL] Try to acquire a high Unix nice
level. This will only succeed if the calling user has a
non-zero RLIMIT_NICE resource limit set (on systems that
support this), or were called SUID root (see below), or we
are configure to be run as system daemon (see --system
above). It is recommended to enable this, since it is only a
negligible security risk (see below).</p>

<p>--realtime[=BOOL] Try to acquire a real-time scheduling
for PulseAudios I/O threads. This will only succeed if the
calling user has a non- zero RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit
set (on systems that support this), or were called SUID root
(see below), or we are config- ure to be run as system
daemon (see --system above). It is rec- ommended to enable
this only for trusted users, since it is a major security
risk (see below).</p>

<p>--disallow-module-loading[=BOOL] Disallow module loading
after startup. This is a security fea- ture since it
disallows additional module loading during runtime and on
user request. It is highly recommended when --system is used
(see above). Note however, that this breaks certain fea-
tures like automatic module loading on hot plug.</p>

<p>--exit-idle-time=SECS Terminate the daemon when idle and
the specified number of sec- onds passed.</p>

<p>--module-idle-time=SECS Unload autoloaded modules when
idle and the specified number of seconds passed.</p>

<p>--scache-idle-time=SECS Unload autoloaded samples from
the cache when the havent been used for the specified number
of seconds.</p>

<p>--log-level[=LEVEL] If an argument is passed, set the
log level to the specified value, otherwise increase the
configured verbosity level by one. The log levels are
numerical from 0 to 4, corresponding to error, warn, notice,
info, debug. Default log level is notice, i.e. all log
messages with lower log levels are printed: error, warn,
notice.</p>

<p>-v Increase the configured verbosity level by one (see
--log-level above). Specify multiple times to increase log
level multiple times.</p>

<p>--log-target={auto,syslog,stderr} Specify the log
target. If set to auto (which is the default), then logging
is directed to syslog when --daemonize is passed, otherwise
to STDERR.</p>

<p>--p | --dl-search-path=PATH Set the search path for
dynamic shared objects (plugins).</p>

<p>--resample-method=METHOD Use the specified resampler by
default (See --dump-resample- methods above for possible
values).</p>

<p>--use-pid-file[=BOOL] Create a PID file. If this options
is disabled it is possible to run multiple sound servers per
user.</p>

<p>--no-cpu-limit[=BOOL] Do not install CPU load limiter on
platforms that support it. By default, PulseAudio will
terminate itself when it notices that it takes up too much
CPU time. This is useful as a protection against system
lockups when real-time scheduling is used (see below).
Disabling this meachnism is useful when debugging PulseAudio
with tools like valgrind(1) which slow down execu- tion.</p>

<p>--disable-shm[=BOOL] PulseAudio clients and the server
can exchange audio data via POSIX shared memory segments (on
systems that support this). If disabled PulseAudio will
communicate exclusively over sockets. Please note that data
transfer via shared memory segments is always disabled when
PulseAudio is running with --system enabled (see above).</p>

<p>-L | --load=&quot;MODULE ARGUMENTS&quot; Load the
specified plugin module with the specified arguments.</p>

<p>-F | --file=FILENAME Run the specified script on
startup. May be specified multiple times to specify multiple
scripts to be run in order. Combine with -n to disable
loading of the default script default.pa (see below).</p>

<p>-C Open a command interpreter on STDIN/STDOUT after
startup. This may be used to configure PulseAudio
dynamically during runtime. Equivalent to
--load=module-cli.</p>

<p>-n Dont load default script file default.pa (see below)
on startup. Useful in conjunction with -C or --file.</p>

<p>FILES ~/.pulse/daemon.conf, /etc/pulse/daemon.conf:
configuration settings for the PulseAudio daemon. If the
version in the user s home directory does not exist the
global configuration file is loaded. See pulse-dae-
mon.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p>~/.pulse/default.pa, /etc/pulse/default.pa: the default
configuration script to execute when the PulseAudio daemon
is started. If the version in the users home directory does
not exist the global configuration script is loaded. See
default.pa(5) for more information.</p>

<p>~/.pulse/client.conf, /etc/pulse/client.conf:
configuration settings for PulseAudio client applications.
If the version in the users home directory does not exist
the global configuration file is loaded. See
pulse-client.conf(5) for more information.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGINT, SIGTERM: the PulseAudio daemon will shut
down (Same as --kill).</p>

<p>SIGHUP: dump a long status report to STDOUT or syslog,
depending on the configuration.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1: load module-cli, allowing runtime
reconfiguration via STDIN/STDOUT.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2: load module-cli-protocol-unix, allowing runtime
reconfigura- tion via a AF_UNIX socket. See pacmd(1) for
more information.</p>

<p>UNIX GROUPS AND USERS Group pulse-rt: if the PulseAudio
binary is marked SUID root, then mem- bership of the calling
user in this group decides whether real-time and/or
high-priority scheduling is enabled. Please note that
enabling real-time scheduling is a security risk (see
below).</p>

<p>Group pulse-access: if PulseAudio is running as a system
daemon (see --system above) access is granted to members of
this group when they connect via AF_UNIX sockets. If
PulseAudio is running as a user daemon this group has no
meaning.</p>

<p>User pulse, group pulse: if PulseAudio is running as a
system daemon (see --system above) and is started as root
the daemon will drop priv- iliges and become a normal user
process using this user and group. If PulseAudio is running
as a user daemon this user and group has no mean- ing.</p>

<p>REAL-TIME AND HIGH-PRIORITY SCHEDULING To minimize the
risk of drop-outs during playback it is recommended to run
PulseAudio with real-time scheduling if the underlying
platform supports it. This decouples the scheduling latency
of the PulseAudio daemon from the system load and is thus
the best way to make sure that PulseAudio always gets CPU
time when it needs it to refill the hardware playback
buffers. Unfortunately this is a security risk on most sys-
tems, since PulseAudio runs as user process, and giving
realtime scheduling priviliges to a user process always
comes with the risk that the user misuses it to lock up the
system -- which is possible since making a process real-time
effectively disables preemption.</p>

<p>To minimize the risk PulseAudio by default does not
enable real-time scheduling. It is however recommended to
enable it on trusted systems. To do that start PulseAudio
with --realtime (see above) or enabled the appropriate
option in daemon.conf. Since acquiring realtime scheduling
is a priviliged operation on most systems, some special
changes to the system configuration need to be made to allow
them to the calling user. Two options are available:</p>

<p>On newer Linux systems the system resource limit
RLIMIT_RTPRIO (see setrlimit(2) for more information) can be
used to allow specific users to acquire real-time
scheduling. This can be configured in /etc/secu-
rity/limits.conf, a resource limit of 9 is recommended.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the SUID root bit can be set for the
PulseAudio binary. Then, the daemon will drop root
priviliges immediately on startup, how- ever retain the
CAP_NICE capability (on systems that support it), but only
if the calling user is a member of the pulse-rt group (see
above). For all other users all capababilities are dropped
immediately. The advantage of this solution is that the
real-time priviliges are only granted to the PulseAudio
daemon -- not to all the users processes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the risk of locking up the machine is
considered too big to enable real-time scheduling,
high-priority scheduling can be enabled instead (i.e.
negative nice level). This can be enabled by passing
--high-priority (see above) when starting PulseAudio and may
also be enabled with the approriate option in daemon.conf.
Negative nice levels can only be enabled when the
appropriate resource limit RLIMIT_NICE is set (see
setrlimit(2) for more information), possibly configured in
/etc/security/limits.conf. A resource limit of 31 (corre-
sponding with nice level -11) is recommended.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The PulseAudio client libraries
check for the existance of the follow- ing environment
variables and change their local configuration accord-
ingly:</p>

<p>$PULSE_SERVER: the server string specifying the server
to connect to when a client asks for a sound server
connection and doesn t explicitly ask for a specific
server.</p>

<p>$PULSE_SINK: the symbolic name of the sink to connect to
when a client creates a playback stream and doesnt
explicitly ask for a specific sink.</p>

<p>$PULSE_SOURCE: the symbolic name of the source to
connect to when a client creates a record stream and doesnt
explicitly ask for a spe- cific source.</p>

<p>$PULSE_BINARY: path of PulseAudio executable to run when
server auto- spawning is used.</p>

<p>$PULSE_CLIENTCONFIG: path of file that shall be read
instead of client.conf (see above) for client
configuration.</p>

<p>$PULSE_COOKIE: path of file that contains the PulseAudio
authentication cookie. Defaults to ~/.pulse-cookie. The
cookie must be shared between users that want to connect to
the same server.</p>

<p>These environment settings take precedence -- if set --
over the con- figuration settings from client.conf (see
above).</p>
