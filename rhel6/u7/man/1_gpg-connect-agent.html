<p>NAME gpg-connect-agent - Communicate with a running
agent</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gpg-connect-agent [options][commands]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gpg-connect-agent is a utility to
communicate with a running gpg- agent. It is useful to check
out the commands gpg-agent provides using the Assuan
interface. It might also be useful for scripting simple
applications. Input is expected at stdin and out put gets
printed to stdout.</p>

<p>It is very similar to running gpg-agent in server mode;
but here we connect to a running instance.</p>

<p>The following options may be used:</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Output additional information while
running.</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>--quiet Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>--homedir dir Set the name of the home directory to dir.
If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to
~/.gnupg . It is only recognized when given on the command
line. It also overrides any home directory stated through
the environment variable GNUPGHOME or (on W32 systems) by
means of the Registry entry
HKCUSoftwareGNUGnuPG:HomeDir.</p>

<p>-S</p>

<p>--raw-socket name Connect to socket name assuming this
is an Assuan style server. Do not run any special
initializations or environment checks. This may be used to
directly connect to any Assuan style socket server.</p>

<p>-E</p>

<p>--exec Take the rest of the command line as a program
and its argu- ments and execute it as an assuan server. Here
is how you would run gpgsm: gpg-connect-agent --exec gpgsm
--server Note that you may not use options on the command
line in this case.</p>

<p>--no-ext-connect When using -S or --exec,
gpg-connect-agent connects to the assuan server in extended
mode to allow descriptor passing. This option makes it use
the old mode.</p>

<p>--run file Run the commands from file at startup and
then continue with the regular input method. Note, that
commands given on the command line are executed after this
file.</p>

<p>-s</p>

<p>--subst Run the command /subst at startup.</p>

<p>--hex Print data lines in a hex format and the ASCII
representation of non-control characters.</p>

<p>--decode Decode data lines. That is to remove percent
escapes but make sure that a new line always starts with a D
and a space.</p>

<p>CONTROL COMMANDS While reading Assuan commands,
gpg-agent also allows a few special com- mands to control
its operation. These control commands all start with a slash
(/).</p>

<p>/echo args Just print args.</p>

<p>/let name value Set the variable name to value.
Variables are only substituted on the input if the /subst
has been used. Variables are refer- enced by prefixing the
name with a dollar sign and optionally include the name in
curly braces. The rules for a valid name are identically to
those of the standard bourne shell. This is not yet enforced
but may be in the future. When used with curly braces no
leading or trailing white space is allowed.</p>

<p>If a variable is not found, it is searched in the
environment and if found copied to the table of
variables.</p>

<p>Variable functions are available: The name of the
function must be followed by at least one space and the at
least one argument. The following functions are
available:</p>

<p>get Return a value described by the argument. Available
arguments are:</p>

<p>cwd The current working directory.</p>

<p>homedir The gnupg homedir.</p>

<p>sysconfdir GnuPG s system configuration directory.</p>

<p>bindir GnuPGs binary directory.</p>

<p>libdir GnuPGs library directory.</p>

<p>libexecdir GnuPG s library directory for executable
files.</p>

<p>datadir GnuPGs data directory.</p>

<p>serverpid The PID of the current server. Command
/serverpid must have been given to return a useful
value.</p>

<p>unescape args Remove C-style escapes from args. Note
that0 and00 terminate the returned string implicitly. The
string to be converted are the entire arguments right behind
the delimiting space of the function name.</p>

<p>unpercent args</p>

<p>unpercent+ args Remove percent style escaping from args.
Note that %00 terminates the string implicitly. The string
to be con- verted are the entire arguments right behind the
delimit- ing space of the function name. unpercent+ also
maps plus signs to a spaces.</p>

<p>percent args</p>

<p>percent+ args Escape the args using percent style
escaping. Tabs, formfeeds, linefeeds, carriage returns and
colons are escaped. percent+ also maps spaces to plus
signs.</p>

<p>errcode arg</p>

<p>errsource arg</p>

<p>errstring arg Assume arg is an integer and evaluate it
using strtol. Return the gpg-error error code, error source
or a for- matted string with the error code and error
source.</p>

<p>+</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>/</p>

<p>% Evaluate all arguments as long integers using strtol
and apply this operator. A division by zero yields an empty
string.</p>

<p>!</p>

<p>|</p>

<p>&amp; Evaluate all arguments as long integers using
strtol and apply the logical oeprators NOT, OR or AND. The
NOT operator works on the last argument only.</p>

<p>/definq name var Use content of the variable var for
inquiries with name. name may be an asterisk (*) to match
any inquiry.</p>

<p>/definqfile name file Use content of file for inquiries
with name. name may be an asterisk (*) to match any
inquiry.</p>

<p>/definqprog name prog Run prog for inquiries matching
name and pass the entire line to it as command line
arguments.</p>

<p>/datafile name Write all data lines from the server to
the file name. The file is opened for writing and created if
it does not exists. An existing file is first truncated to
0. The data written to the file fully decoded. Using a
single dash for name writes to std- out. The file is kept
open until a new file is set using this command or this
command is used without an argument.</p>

<p>/showdef Print all definitions</p>

<p>/cleardef Delete all definitions</p>

<p>/sendfd file mode Open file in mode (which needs to be a
valid fopen mode string) and send the file descriptor to the
server. This is usually followed by a command like INPUT FD
to set the input source for other commands.</p>

<p>/recvfd Not yet implemented.</p>

<p>/open var file [mode] Open file and assign the file
descriptor to var. Warning: This command is experimental and
might change in future versions.</p>

<p>/close fd Close the file descriptor fd. Warning: This
command is experi- mental and might change in future
versions.</p>

<p>/showopen Show a list of open files.</p>

<p>/serverpid Send the Assuan command GETINFO pid to the
server and store the returned PID for internal purposes.</p>

<p>/sleep Sleep for a second.</p>

<p>/hex</p>

<p>/nohex Same as the command line option --hex.</p>

<p>/decode</p>

<p>/nodecode Same as the command line option --decode.</p>

<p>/subst</p>

<p>/nosubst Enable and disable variable substitution. It
defaults to dis- abled unless the command line option
--subst has been used. If /subst as been enabled once,
leading whitespace is removed from input lines which makes
scripts easier to read.</p>

<p>/while condition</p>

<p>/end These commands provide a way for executing loops.
All lines between the while and the corresponding end are
executed as long as the evaluation of condition yields a
non-zero value. The evaluation is done by passing condition
to the strtol function. Example:</p>

<p>/subst /let i 3 /while $i /echo loop couter is $i /let i
${- $i 1} /end</p>

<p>/run file Run commands from file.</p>

<p>/bye Terminate the connection and the program</p>

<p>/help Print a list of available control commands.</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a
Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual including
a menu struc- ture and an index.</p>
