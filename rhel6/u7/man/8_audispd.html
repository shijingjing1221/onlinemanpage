<p>NAME audispd - an event multiplexor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS audispd</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION audispd is an audit event multiplexor. It
has to be started by the audit daemon in order to get
events. It takes audit events and dis- tributes them to
child programs that want to analyze events in real- time.
When the audit daemon receives a SIGTERM or SIGHUP, it
passes that signal to the dispatcher, too. The dispatcher in
turn passes those signals to its child processes.</p>

<p>The child programs install a configuration file in a
plugins directory, /etc/audisp/plugins.d. Filenames are not
allowed to have more than one . in the name or it will be
treated as a backup copy and skipped. Options are given one
per line with an equal sign between the keyword and its
value. The available options are as follows:</p>

<p>active The options for this are yes or no.</p>

<p>direction The option is dictated by the plugin. In or
out are the only choices. You cannot make a plugin operate
in a way it wasnt designed just by changing this option.This
option is to give a clue to the event dispatcher about which
direction events flow. NOTE: inbound events are not
supported yet.</p>

<p>path This is the absolute path to the plugin executable.
In the case of internal plugins, it would be the name of the
plugin.</p>

<p>type This tells the dispatcher how the plugin wants to
be run. Choices are builtin and always. Builtin should
always be given for plugins that are internal to the audit
event dispatcher. These are af_unix and syslog. The option
always should be given for most if not all plugins. The
default setting is always.</p>

<p>args This allows you to pass arguments to the child
program. Gener- ally plugins do not take arguments and have
their own config file that instructs them how they should be
configured. At the moment, there is a limit of 2 args.</p>

<p>format The valid options for this are binary and string.
Binary passes the data exactly as the audit event dispatcher
gets it from the audit daemon. The string option tells the
dispatcher to com- pletely change the event into a string
suitable for parsing with the audit parsing library. The
default value is string.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/audisp/audispd.conf /etc/audisp/plugins.d</p>
