<p>CPUSPEED(8) Program Options CPUSPEED(8)</p>

<p>NAME cpuspeed - user-space cpu frequency scaling
program, v1.5.1</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cpuspeed [Options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION cpuspeed v1.5.1</p>

<p>This program monitors the systems idle percentage and
reduces or raises the CPUs clock speeds and voltages
accordingly to minimize power consumption when idle and
maximize performance when needed. This is the default.</p>

<p>The program may also optionally be configured to reduce
the CPUs clock speeds if the temperature gets too high, NOT
minimize their speeds if the computers AC adapter is
disconnected or maximize their speeds when the AC adapter is
connected.</p>

<p>By default this program will manage every CPU found in
the system.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<p>-d</p>

<p>Tells the process to daemonize itself (run in
background).</p>

<p>-i &lt;interval&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the interval between idle percentage tests and
possible speed changes in tenths of a second (default is
20).</p>

<p>-p &lt;fast up&gt; &lt;threshold&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the CPU core idle percentage thresholds. &lt;fast
up&gt; is the idle percentage below which a CPU core will be
set to the high- est possible speed. &lt;threshold&gt; is
the idle percentage above which a CPU cores speed will be
decreased and below which a CPU core s speed will be
increased (defaults are 10 and 25).</p>

<p>-m &lt;minimum speed&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the minimum speed in KHz below which a CPU core
will not be set.</p>

<p>-M &lt;maximum speed&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the maximum speed in KHz above which a CPU core
will not be set.</p>

<p>-n</p>

<p>Do not treat niced programs as idle time.</p>

<p>-w</p>

<p>Do not treat time waiting for IO as idle time.</p>

<p>-t &lt;temp file&gt; &lt;maxtemp&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the ACPI temperature file and the temperature at
which CPUs will be set to minimum speed.</p>

<p>-T &lt;interval&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the interval at which the temperature will be
polled in tenths of a second (default is 10). (Requires the
-t option above.)</p>

<p>-a &lt;AC file&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the ACPI AC adapter state file and tells the
program to set the CPUs to minimum speed when the AC adapter
is disconnected. (This is the default but is changeable by
the -D option below).</p>

<p>-A &lt;interval&gt;</p>

<p>Sets the interval at which the AC adapter state will be
polled in tenths of a second (default is 50). (Requires the
-a option above.)</p>

<p>-C</p>

<p>Run at maximum speed when AC adapter is connected.
(Requires the -a option above.)</p>

<p>-D</p>

<p>Do NOT force minimum speed when AC adapter is
disconnected. (Requires the -a option above.)</p>

<p>-r</p>

<p>Restores previous speed on program exit.</p>

<p>-S &lt;CPU core 1&gt; [[&lt;CPU core 2&gt;] ...]</p>

<p>Manage only a single group of CPU cores. All of the
specified cores will controlled as a single group (locked to
the same speed) and are in the range 0 to n-1 where n is the
total num- ber of CPU cores in the system. Note that when
specifying mul- tiple cores the list must be enclosed in
quotes. Without this option the program creates copies of
itself to manage every core of every CPU in the system and
automatically determines core groups. If you are running on
an old kernel and get an error message about not being able
to open an &quot;affected_cpus&quot; file then you must run
this program separately for each group of cores that must be
controlled together (which probably means for each physical
CPU) and use this option.</p>

<p>Notes: To have a CPU core stay at the highest clock
speed to maximize perfor- mance send the process controlling
that CPU core the SIGUSR1 signal.</p>

<p>To have a CPU core stay at the lowest clock speed to
maximize battery life send the process controlling that CPU
core the SIGUSR2 signal.</p>

<p>To resume having a CPU cores clock speed dynamically
scaled send the process controlling that CPU core the SIGHUP
signal.</p>

<p>Many modern Linux systems support in-kernel cpu
frequency scaling. The cpuspeed daemon only works in
conjunction with the userspace fre- quency scaling governor.
Other governors, such as ondemand and con- servative , rely
on the Linux kernel to adjust cpu frequencies on the fly
without the need of any user-space assistance, such as that
pro- vided by cpuspeed.</p>

<p>Red Hat and Fedora distributions employ a unified
configuration file for both scenarios, as well as a cpuspeed
init script that will config- ure either cpuspeed or
in-kernel cpu frequency scaling, as appropriate.</p>
