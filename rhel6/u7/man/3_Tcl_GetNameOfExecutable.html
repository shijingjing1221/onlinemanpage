<p>Tcl_FindExecutable(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_FindExecutable(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_FindExecutable, Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable -
identify or return the name of the binary file containing
the application</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>void Tcl_FindExecutable(argv0)</p>

<p>const char * Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable()</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS char *argv0 (in) The first command-line
argument to the pro- gram, which gives the application s
name.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Tcl_FindExecutable procedure computes
the full path name of the executable file from which the
application was invoked and saves it for Tcls internal use.
The executables path name is needed for several purposes in
Tcl. For example, it is needed on some platforms in the
implementation of the load command. It is also returned by
the info nameofexecutable command.</p>

<p>On UNIX platforms this procedure is typically invoked as
the very first thing in the application s main program; it
must be passed argv[0] as its argument. It is important not
to change the working directory before the invocation.
Tcl_FindExecutable uses argv0 along with the PATH
environment variable to find the application s executable,
if pos- sible. If it fails to find the binary, then future
calls to info name- ofexecutable will return an empty
string.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable simply returns a pointer to the
internal full path name of the executable file as computed
by Tcl_FindExecutable. This procedure call is the C API
equivalent to the info nameofexe- cutable command. NULL is
returned if the internal full path name has not been
computed or unknown.</p>

<p>KEYWORDS binary, executable file</p>
