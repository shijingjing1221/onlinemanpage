<p>NAME isnsdd - iSNS discovery daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isnsdd [-f] [-c filename] [-d
debug-facility]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Isnsdd is a client side daemon for iSNS. It
registers storage nodes and portals with the iSNS service,
and refreshes these registrations in a timely manner.</p>

<p>The daemon also registers itself to receive SCN
notifications, and pro- cesses these. It can be configured
to invoke an external helper appli- cation for each status
notification received. The path name of the helper
application can be specified via the SCNCallout option in
the configuration file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS By default, isnsd will take most of its settings
from the configuration file /etc/isns/isnsdd.conf, with the
addition of the following command line options:</p>

<p>--config filename, -c filename This option overrides the
default configuration file.</p>

<p>--foreground,-f By default, isnsd will put itself into
the background. By speci- fying this option, you can tell it
to run in the foreground. Any error messages or debug output
will be printed to the console rather than being sent to
syslog.</p>

<p>--role role This tells the discovery daemon in which
capacity is should reg- ister itself with the iSNS server.
Role can be either initia- tor, or control. The default is
to register as an initiator.</p>

<p>Registering target nodes needs to use a different
mechanism, as the iSCSI target server needs to inform the
discovery daemon about each exported target separately. This
is not implemented yet.</p>

<p>--debug facility, -d facility enables debugging. Valid
facilities are</p>
