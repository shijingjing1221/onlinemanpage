<p>STRUCT SPI_DRIVER(9) Serial Peripheral Interface (S
STRUCT SPI_DRIVER(9)</p>

<p>NAME struct_spi_driver - Host side protocol driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS struct spi_driver { const struct spi_device_id
* id_table; int (* probe) (struct spi_device *spi); int (*
remove) (struct spi_device *spi); void (* shutdown) (struct
spi_device *spi); int (* suspend) (struct spi_device *spi,
pm_message_t mesg); int (* resume) (struct spi_device *spi);
struct device_driver driver; };</p>

<p>MEMBERS id_table List of SPI devices supported by this
driver</p>

<p>probe Binds this driver to the spi device. Drivers can
verify that the device is actually present, and may need to
configure characteristics (such as bits_per_word) which
weren&acute;t needed for the initial configuration done
during system setup.</p>

<p>remove Unbinds this driver from the spi device</p>

<p>shutdown Standard shutdown callback used during system
state transitions such as powerdown/halt and kexec</p>

<p>suspend Standard suspend callback used during system
state transitions</p>

<p>resume Standard resume callback used during system state
transitions</p>

<p>driver SPI device drivers should initialize the name and
owner field of this structure.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This represents the kind of device driver
that uses SPI messages to interact with the hardware at the
other end of a SPI link. It&acute;s called a protocol driver
because it works through messages rather than talking
directly to SPI hardware (which is what the underlying SPI
controller driver does to pass those messages). These
protocols are defined in the specification for the device(s)
supported by the driver.</p>

<p>As a rule, those device protocols represent the lowest
level interface supported by a driver, and it will support
upper level interfaces too. Examples of such upper levels
include frameworks like MTD, networking, MMC, RTC,
filesystem character device nodes, and hardware
monitoring.</p>
