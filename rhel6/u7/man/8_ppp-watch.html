<p>NAME ppp-watch - daemon to make PPP interfaces act more
like other inter- faces</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppp-watch interface-name [boot]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ppp-watch manages one PPP connection,
including starting, stopping, and redialing. It makes
starting and stopping the connection synchronous
activities.</p>

<p>ppp-watch is not really meant to be called directly. It
should only be used from within the ifup-ppp script.</p>

<p>OPTIONS interface-name The name of the PPP interface to
bring up.</p>

<p>boot ppp-watch is being called at boot time and should
time out after a while if the PPP connection does not come
up in order not to hang the boot sequence.</p>
