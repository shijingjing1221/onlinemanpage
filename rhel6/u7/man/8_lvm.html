<p>NAME lvm LVM2 tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvm [command | file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvm provides the command-line tools for
LVM2. A separate manual page describes each command in
detail.</p>

<p>If lvm is invoked with no arguments it presents a
readline prompt (assuming it was compiled with readline
support). LVM commands may be entered interactively at this
prompt with readline facilities including history and
command name and option completion. Refer to readline(3) for
details.</p>

<p>If lvm is invoked with argv[0] set to the name of a
specific LVM com- mand (for example by using a hard or soft
link) it acts as that com- mand.</p>

<p>On invocation, lvm requires that only the standard file
descriptors stdin, stdout and stderr are available. If
others are found, they get closed and messages are issued
warning about the leak. This warning can be suppressed by
setting the environment variable LVM_SUP-
PRESS_FD_WARNINGS.</p>

<p>Where commands take VG or LV names as arguments, the
full path name is optional. An LV called &quot;lvol0&quot;
in a VG called &quot;vg0&quot; can be specified as
&quot;vg0/lvol0&quot;. Where a list of VGs is required but
is left empty, a list of all VGs will be substituted. Where
a list of LVs is required but a VG is given, a list of all
the LVs in that VG will be substi- tuted. So lvdisplay vg0
will display all the LVs in &quot;vg0&quot;. Tags can also
be used - see --addtag below.</p>

<p>One advantage of using the built-in shell is that
configuration infor- mation gets cached internally between
commands.</p>

<p>A file containing a simple script with one command per
line can also be given on the command line. The script can
also be executed directly if the first line is #! followed
by the absolute path of lvm.</p>

<p>BUILT-IN COMMANDS The following commands are built into
lvm without links normally being created in the filesystem
for them.</p>

<p>The following commands are not implemented in LVM2 but

<p>OPTIONS The following options are available for many of
the commands. They are implemented generically and
documented here rather than repeated on individual manual
pages.</p>

<p>-h, -?, --help Display the help text.</p>

<p>--version Display version information.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Set verbose level. Repeat from 1 to 3
times to increase the detail of messages sent to stdout and
stderr. Overrides config file setting.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Set debug level. Repeat from 1 to 6 times to
increase the detail of messages sent to the log file and/or
syslog (if configured). Overrides config file setting.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Suppress output and log messages. Overrides
-d and -v. Repeat once to also suppress any prompts with
answer no.</p>

<p>--yes Don t prompt for confirmation interactively but
instead always assume the answer is yes. Take great care if
you use this!</p>

<p>-t, --test Run in test mode. Commands will not update
metadata. This is implemented by disabling all metadata
writing but nevertheless returning success to the calling
function. This may lead to unusual error messages in
multi-stage operations if a tool relies on reading back
metadata it believes has changed but hasnt.</p>

<p>--driverloaded {y|n} Whether or not the device-mapper
kernel driver is loaded. If you set this to n, no attempt
will be made to contact the driver.</p>

<p>-A, --autobackup {y|n} Whether or not to metadata should
be backed up automatically after a change. You are strongly
advised not to disable this! See vgcfgbackup(8).</p>

<p>-P, --partial When set, the tools will do their best to
provide access to Vol- ume Groups that are only partially
available (one or more Physi- cal Volumes belonging to the
Volume Group are missing from the system). Where part of a
logical volume is missing, /dev/ioer- ror will be
substituted, and you could use dmsetup(8) to set this up to
return I/O errors when accessed, or create it as a large
block device of nulls. Metadata may not be changed with this
option. To insert a replacement Physical Volume of the same
or large size use pvcreate -u to set the uuid to match the
orig- inal followed by vgcfgrestore(8).</p>

<p>-S, --select Selection For reporting commands, display
only rows that match selection criteria. All rows are
displayed with the additional &quot;selected&quot; column
(-o selected) showing 1 if the row matches the Selection and
0 otherwise. For non-reporting commands which process LVM
entities, the selection can be used to match items to
process. See SELECTION CRITERIA section of this man page for
more infor- mation about the way the selection criteria are
constructed.</p>

<p>-M, --metadatatype Type Specifies which type of on-disk
metadata to use, such as lvm1 or lvm2, which can be
abbreviated to 1 or 2 respectively. The default (lvm2) can
be changed by setting format in the global section of the
config file.</p>

<p>--ignorelockingfailure This lets you proceed with
read-only metadata operations such as lvchange -ay and
vgchange -ay even if the locking module fails. One use for
this is in a system init script if the lock direc- tory is
mounted read-only when the script runs.</p>

<p>--ignoreskippedcluster Use to avoid exiting with an
non-zero status code if the command is run without clustered
locking and some clustered Volume Groups have to be skipped
over.</p>

<p>--readonly Run the command in a special read-only mode
which will read on- disk metadata without needing to take
any locks. This can be used to peek inside metadata used by
a virtual machine image while the virtual machine is
running. It can also be used to peek inside the metadata of
clustered Volume Groups when clus- tered locking is not
configured or running. No attempt will be made to
communicate with the device-mapper kernel driver, so this
option is unable to report whether or not Logical Volumes
are actually in use.</p>

<p>--foreign Cause the command to access foreign VGs, that
would otherwise be skipped. It can be used to report or
display a VG that is owned by another host. This option can
cause a command to perform poorly because lvmetad caching is
not used and metadata is read from disks.</p>

<p>--addtag Tag Add the tag Tag to a PV, VG or LV. Supply
this argument multi- ple times to add more than one tag at
once. A tag is a word that can be used to group LVM2 objects
of the same type together. Tags can be given on the command
line in place of PV, VG or LV arguments. Tags should be
prefixed with @ to avoid ambiguity. Each tag is expanded by
replacing it with all objects possessing that tag which are
of the type expected by its position on the command line.
PVs can only possess tags while they are part of a Volume
Group: PV tags are discarded if the PV is removed from the
VG. As an example, you could tag some LVs as database and
others as userdata and then activate the database ones with
lvchange -ay @database. Objects can pos- sess multiple tags
simultaneously. Only the new LVM2 metadata format supports
tagging: objects using the LVM1 metadata format cannot be
tagged because the on-disk format does not support it.
Characters allowed in tags are: A-Z a-z 0-9 _ + . - and as
of version 2.02.78 the following characters are also
accepted: / = ! : # &amp;</p>

<p>--deltag Tag Delete the tag Tag from a PV, VG or LV, if
its present. Supply this argument multiple times to remove
more than one tag at once.</p>

<p>--alloc {anywhere|contiguous|cling|inherit|normal}
Selects the allocation policy when a command needs to
allocate Physical Extents from the Volume Group. Each Volume
Group and Logical Volume has an allocation policy defined.
The default for a Volume Group is normal which applies
common-sense rules such as not placing parallel stripes on
the same Physical Vol- ume. The default for a Logical Volume
is inherit which applies the same policy as for the Volume
Group. These policies can be changed using lvchange(8) and
vgchange(8) or overridden on the command line of any command
that performs allocation. The con- tiguous policy requires
that new Physical Extents be placed adjacent to existing
Physical Extents. The cling policy places new Physical
Extents on the same Physical Volume as existing Physical
Extents in the same stripe of the Logical Volume. If there
are sufficient free Physical Extents to satisfy an alloca-
tion request but normal doesnt use them, anywhere will -
even if that reduces performance by placing two stripes on
the same Physical Volume.</p>

<p>--commandprofile ProfileName Selects the command
configuration profile to use when processing an LVM command.
See also lvm.conf(5) for more information about command
profile config and the way it fits with other LVM con-
figuration methods. Using --commandprofile option overrides
any command profile specified via LVM_COMMAND_PROFILE
environment variable.</p>

<p>--metadataprofile ProfileName Selects the metadata
configuration profile to use when process- ing an LVM
command. When using metadata profile during Volume Group or
Logical Volume creation, the metadata profile name is saved
in metadata. When such Volume Group or Logical Volume is
processed next time, the metadata profile is automatically
applied and the use of --metadataprofile option is not
neces- sary. See also lvm.conf(5) for more information about
metadata profile config and the way it fits with other LVM
configuration methods.</p>

<p>--profile ProfileName A short form of --metadataprofile
for vgcreate, lvcreate, vgchange and lvchange command and a
short form of --commandpro- file for any other command (with
the exception of dumpconfig command where the --profile has
special meaning, see lvm dump- config(8) for more
information).</p>

<p>--config ConfigurationString Uses the
ConfigurationString as direct string representation of the
configuration to override the existing configuration. The
ConfigurationString is of exactly the same format as used in
any LVM configuration file. See lvm.conf(5) for more
information about direct config override on command line and
the way it fits with other LVM configuration methods.</p>

<p>VALID NAMES The valid characters for VG and LV names
are: a-z A-Z 0-9 + _ . -</p>

<p>VG and LV names cannot begin with a hyphen. There are
also various reserved names that are used internally by lvm
that can not be used as LV or VG names. A VG cannot be
called anything that exists in /dev/ at the time of
creation, nor can it be called . or ... An LV cannot be
called ., .., snapshot or pvmove. The LV name may also not
contain any of the following strings: _cdata, _cmeta,
_corig, _mlog, _mimage, _pmspare, _rimage, _rlog , _tdata or
_tmeta. A directory bearing the name of each Volume Group is
created under /dev when any of its Logical Volumes are
activated. Each active Logical Volume is accessible from
this directory as a symbolic link leading to a device node.
Links or nodes in /dev/mapper are intended only for internal
use and the precise format and escaping might change between
releases and distributions. Other software and scripts
should use the /dev/VolumeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName format
to reduce the chance of needing amendment when the software
is updated. Should you need to process the node names in
/dev/mapper, you may use dmsetup splitname to separate out
the original VG, LV and internal layer names.</p>

<p>ALLOCATION When an operation needs to allocate Physical
Extents for one or more Logical Volumes, the tools proceed
as follows:</p>

<p>First of all, they generate the complete set of
unallocated Physical Extents in the Volume Group. If any
ranges of Physical Extents are supplied at the end of the
command line, only unallocated Physical Extents within those
ranges on the specified Physical Volumes are con-
sidered.</p>

<p>Then they try each allocation policy in turn, starting
with the strictest policy (contiguous) and ending with the
allocation policy specified using --alloc or set as the
default for the particular Logi- cal Volume or Volume Group
concerned. For each policy, working from the lowest-numbered
Logical Extent of the empty Logical Volume space that needs
to be filled, they allocate as much space as possible
according to the restrictions imposed by the policy. If more
space is needed, they move on to the next policy.</p>

<p>The restrictions are as follows:</p>

<p>Contiguous requires that the physical location of any
Logical Extent that is not the first Logical Extent of a
Logical Volume is adjacent to the physical location of the
Logical Extent immediately preceding it.</p>

<p>Cling requires that the Physical Volume used for any
Logical Extent to be added to an existing Logical Volume is
already in use by at least one Logical Extent earlier in
that Logical Volume. If the configura- tion parameter
allocation/cling_tag_list is defined, then two Physical
Volumes are considered to match if any of the listed tags is
present on both Physical Volumes. This allows groups of
Physical Volumes with similar properties (such as their
physical location) to be tagged and treated as equivalent
for allocation purposes.</p>

<p>When a Logical Volume is striped or mirrored, the above
restrictions are applied independently to each stripe or
mirror image (leg) that needs space.</p>

<p>Normal will not choose a Physical Extent that shares the
same Physical Volume as a Logical Extent already allocated
to a parallel Logical Vol- ume (i.e. a different stripe or
mirror image/leg) at the same offset within that parallel
Logical Volume.</p>

<p>When allocating a mirror log at the same time as Logical
Volumes to hold the mirror data, Normal will first try to
select different Physi- cal Volumes for the log and the
data. If that s not possible and the
allocation/mirror_logs_require_separate_pvs configuration
parameter is set to 0, it will then allow the log to share
Physical Volume(s) with part of the data.</p>

<p>When allocating thin pool metadata, similar
considerations to those of a mirror log in the last
paragraph apply based on the value of the
allocation/thin_pool_metadata_require_separate_pvs
configuration param- eter.</p>

<p>If you rely upon any layout behaviour beyond that
documented here, be aware that it might change in future
versions of the code.</p>

<p>For example, if you supply on the command line two empty
Physical Vol- umes that have an identical number of free
Physical Extents available for allocation, the current code
considers using each of them in the order they are listed,
but there is no guarantee that future releases will maintain
that property. If it is important to obtain a specific
layout for a particular Logical Volume, then you should
build it up through a sequence of lvcreate(8) and
lvconvert(8) steps such that the restrictions described
above applied to each step leave the tools no discretion
over the layout.</p>

<p>To view the way the allocation process currently works
in any specific case, read the debug logging output, for
example by adding -vvvv to a command.</p>

<p>LOGICAL VOLUME TYPES Some logical volume types are
simple to create and can be done with a single lvcreate(8)
command. The linear and striped logical volume types are an
example of this. Other logical volume types may require more
than one command to create. The cache (lvmcache(7)) and thin
pro- visioning (lvmthin(7)) types are examples of this.</p>

<p>SELECTION CRITERIA The selection criteria are a set of
statements combined by logical and grouping operators. The
statement consists of column name for which a set of valid
values is defined using comparison operators. For complete
list of column names (fields) that can be used in selection,
see the output of &lt;lvm reporting command&gt; -S help.</p>

<p>Comparison operators (cmp_op):</p>

<p>=~ Matching regular expression.</p>

<p>!~ Not matching regular expression.</p>

<p>= Equal to.</p>

<p>!= Not equal to.</p>

<p>&gt;= Greater than or equal to.</p>

<p>&gt; Greater than</p>

<p>&lt;= Less than or equal to.</p>

<p>&lt; Less than.</p>

<p>Binary logical operators (cmp_log):</p>

<p>&amp;&amp; All fields must match</p>

<p>, All fields must match</p>

<p>|| At least one field must match</p>

<p># At least one field must match</p>

<p>Unary logical operators:</p>

<p>! Logical negation</p>

<p>Grouping operators:</p>

<p>( Left parenthesis</p>

<p>) Right parenthesis</p>

<p>[ List start</p>

<p>] List end</p>

<p>{ List subset start</p>

<p>} List subset end</p>

<p>Informal grammar specification:</p>

<p>STATEMENT = column cmp_op VALUE | STATEMENT log_op
STATEMENT | (STATEMENT) | !(STATEMENT)</p>

<p>VALUE = [VALUE log_op VALUE] For list-based types:
string list. Matches strictly. The log_op must always be of
one type within the whole list value.</p>

<p>VALUE = {VALUE log_op VALUE} For list-based types:
string list. Matches a subset. The log_op must always be of
one type within the whole list value.</p>

<p>VALUE = value For scalar types: number (integer), size
(floating point number with size unit suffix), percent
(floating point number with or without % suffix),
string.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All tools return a status code of zero on
success or non-zero on fail- ure.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES HOME Directory containing
.lvm_history if the internal readline shell is invoked.</p>

<p>LVM_COMMAND_PROFILE Name of default command profile to
use for LVM commands. This profile is overriden by direct
use of --commandprofile command line option.</p>

<p>LVM_SYSTEM_DIR Directory containing lvm.conf(5) and
other LVM system files. Defaults to
&quot;/etc/lvm&quot;.</p>

<p>LVM_SUPPRESS_FD_WARNINGS Suppress warnings about openned
file descriptors, when lvm com- mand is executed.</p>

<p>LVM_VG_NAME The Volume Group name that is assumed for
any reference to a Logical Volume that doesnt specify a
path. Not set by default.</p>

<p>LVM_LVMETAD_PIDFILE Path for the lvmetad pid file.</p>

<p>LVM_LVMETAD_SOCKET Path for the lvmetad socket file.</p>
