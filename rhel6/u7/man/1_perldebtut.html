<p>NAME perldebtut - Perl debugging tutorial</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A (very) lightweight introduction in the use
of the perl debugger, and a pointer to existing, deeper
sources of information on the subject of debugging perl
programs.</p>

<p>Theres an extraordinary number of people out there who
don t appear to know anything about using the perl debugger,
though they use the language every day. This is for
them.</p>

<p>use strict First of all, theres a few things you can do
to make your life a lot more straightforward when it comes
to debugging perl programs, without using the debugger at
all. To demonstrate, heres a simple script, named
&quot;hello&quot;, with a problem:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl</p>

<p>$var1 = &rsquo;Hello World&rsquo;; # always wanted to do
that :-) $var2 = &quot;$varl0;</p>

<p>print $var2; exit;</p>

<p>While this compiles and runs happily, it probably wont
do whats expected, namely it doesnt print &quot;Hello World0
at all; It will on the other hand do exactly what it was
told to do, computers being a bit that way inclined. That
is, it will print out a newline character, and youll get
what looks like a blank line. It looks like theres 2
variables when (because of the typo) theres really 3:</p>

<p>$var1 = &rsquo;Hello World&rsquo;; $varl = undef; $var2
= &quot;0;</p>

<p>To catch this kind of problem, we can force each
variable to be declared before use by pulling in the strict
module, by putting use strict; after the first line of the
script.</p>

<p>Now when you run it, perl complains about the 3
undeclared variables and we get four error messages because
one variable is referenced twice:</p>

<p>Global symbol &quot;$var1&quot; requires explicit
package name at ./t1 line 4. Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot;
requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5. Global symbol
&quot;$varl&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1
line 5. Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot; requires explicit
package name at ./t1 line 7. Execution of ./hello aborted
due to compilation errors.</p>

<p>Luvverly! and to fix this we declare all variables
explicitly and now our script looks like this:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict;</p>

<p>my $var1 = &rsquo;Hello World&rsquo;; my $varl = undef;
my $var2 = &quot;$varl0;</p>

<p>print $var2; exit;</p>

<p>We then do (always a good idea) a syntax check before we
try to run it again:</p>

<p>&gt; perl -c hello hello syntax OK</p>

<p>And now when we run it, we get &quot;0 still, but at
least we know why. Just getting this script to compile has
exposed the $varl (with the letter l ) variable, and simply
changing $varl to $var1 solves the problem.</p>

<p>Looking at data and -w and v Ok, but how about when you
want to really see your data, whats in that dynamic
variable, just before using it?</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict;</p>

<p>my $key = &rsquo;welcome&rsquo;; my %data = (
&rsquo;this&rsquo; =&gt; qw(that), &rsquo;tom&rsquo; =&gt;
qw(and jerry), &rsquo;welcome&rsquo; =&gt; q(Hello World),
&rsquo;zip&rsquo; =&gt; q(welcome), ); my @data = keys
%data;</p>

<p>print &quot;$data{$key}0; exit;</p>

<p>Looks OK, after its been through the syntax check (perl
-c scriptname), we run it and all we get is a blank line
again! Hmmmm.</p>

<p>One common debugging approach here, would be to
liberally sprinkle a few print statements, to add a check
just before we print out our data, and another just
after:</p>

<p>print &quot;All OK0 if grep($key, keys %data); print
&quot;$data{$key}0; print &quot;done:
&rsquo;$data{$key}&rsquo;0;</p>

<p>And try again:</p>

<p>&gt; perl data All OK</p>

<p>done: &rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>After much staring at the same piece of code and not
seeing the wood for the trees for some time, we get a cup of
coffee and try another approach. That is, we bring in the
cavalry by giving perl the -d switch on the command
line:</p>

<p>&gt; perl -d data Default die handler restored.</p>

<p>Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07 Editor
support available.</p>

<p>Enter h or &lsquo;h h&rsquo; for help, or &lsquo;man
perldebug&rsquo; for more help.</p>

<p>main::(./data:4): my $key = &rsquo;welcome&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Now, what we ve done here is to launch the built-in perl
debugger on our script. Its stopped at the first line of
executable code and is waiting for input.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, youll want to know how to quit
the debugger: use just the letter q, not the words quit or
exit:</p>

<p>DB&lt;1&gt; q &gt;</p>

<p>Thats it, youre back on home turf again.</p>

<p>help Fire the debugger up again on your script and well
look at the help menu. Theres a couple of ways of calling
help: a simple h will get the summary help list, |h (pipe-h)
will pipe the help through your pager (which is (probably
more or less), and finally, h h (h-space-h) will give you
the entire help screen. Here is the summary page:</p>

<p>D1h</p>

current_package [Vars]&quot;. y [n [Vars]] List lexicals in

h cmd_letter, or run man perldebug for all docs.</p>

<p>More confusing options than you can shake a big stick
at! Its not as bad as it looks and its very useful to know
more about all of it, and fun too!</p>

<p>Theres a couple of useful ones to know about straight
away. You wouldn t think we re using any libraries at all at
the moment, but M will show which modules are currently
loaded, and their version number, while m will show the
methods, and S shows all subroutines (by pattern) as shown
below. V and X show variables in the program by package
scope and can be constrained by pattern.</p>

<p>DB&lt;2&gt;S str dumpvar::stringify strict::bits
strict::import strict::unimport</p>

<p>Using X and cousins requires you not to use the type
identifiers ($@%), just the name:</p>

<p>DM&lt;3&gt;X ~err FileHandle(stderr) =&gt; fileno(2)</p>

<p>Remember were in our tiny program with a problem, we
should have a look at where we are, and what our data looks
like. First of all lets view some code at our present
position (the first line of code in this case), via v:</p>

<p>DB&lt;4&gt; v 1 #!/usr/bin/perl 2: use strict; 3 4==&gt;
my $key = &rsquo;welcome&rsquo;; 5: my %data = ( 6
&rsquo;this&rsquo; =&gt; qw(that), 7 &rsquo;tom&rsquo; =&gt;
qw(and jerry), 8 &rsquo;welcome&rsquo; =&gt; q(Hello World),
9 &rsquo;zip&rsquo; =&gt; q(welcome), 10 );</p>

<p>At line number 4 is a helpful pointer, that tells you
where you are now. To see more code, type v again:</p>

<p>DB&lt;4&gt; v 8 &rsquo;welcome&rsquo; =&gt; q(Hello
World), 9 &rsquo;zip&rsquo; =&gt; q(welcome), 10 ); 11: my
@data = keys %data; 12: print &quot;All OK0 if grep($key,
keys %data); 13: print &quot;$data{$key}0; 14: print
&quot;done: &rsquo;$data{$key}&rsquo;0; 15: exit;</p>

<p>And if you wanted to list line 5 again, type l 5 , (note
the space):</p>

<p>DB&lt;4&gt; l 5 5: my %data = (</p>

<p>In this case, there s not much to see, but of course
normally theres pages of stuff to wade through, and l can be
very useful. To reset your view to the line were about to
execute, type a lone period .:</p>

<p>DB&lt;5&gt; . main::(./data_a:4): my $key =
&rsquo;welcome&rsquo;;</p>

<p>The line shown is the one that is about to be executed
next, it hasnt happened yet. So while we can print a
variable with the letter p, at this point all wed get is an
empty (undefined) value back. What we need to do is to step
through the next executable statement with an s:</p>

<p>DB&lt;6&gt; s main::(./data_a:5): my %data = (
main::(./data_a:6): &rsquo;this&rsquo; =&gt; qw(that),
main::(./data_a:7): &rsquo;tom&rsquo; =&gt; qw(and jerry),
main::(./data_a:8): &rsquo;welcome&rsquo; =&gt; q(Hello
World), main::(./data_a:9): &rsquo;zip&rsquo; =&gt;
q(welcome), main::(./data_a:10): );</p>

<p>Now we can have a look at that first ($key)
variable:</p>

<p>DB&lt;7&gt; p $key welcome</p>

<p>line 13 is where the action is, so lets continue down to
there via the letter c , which by the way, inserts a
one-time-only breakpoint at the given line or sub
routine:</p>

<p>DB&lt;8&gt; c 13 All OK main::(./data_a:13): print
&quot;$data{$key}0;</p>

<p>Weve gone past our check (where All OK was printed) and
have stopped just before the meat of our task. We could try
to print out a couple of variables to see what is
happening:</p>

<p>DB&lt;9&gt; p $data{$key}</p>

<p>Not much in there, lets have a look at our hash:</p>

<p>DB&lt;10&gt; p %data Hello
Worldziptomandwelcomejerrywelcomethisthat</p>

<p>DB&lt;11&gt; p keys %data Hello
Worldtomwelcomejerrythis</p>

<p>Well, this isnt very easy to read, and using the helpful
manual (h h), the x command looks promising:</p>

<p>DB&lt;12&gt; x %data 0 &rsquo;Hello World&rsquo; 1
&rsquo;zip&rsquo; 2 &rsquo;tom&rsquo; 3 &rsquo;and&rsquo; 4
&rsquo;welcome&rsquo; 5 undef 6 &rsquo;jerry&rsquo; 7
&rsquo;welcome&rsquo; 8 &rsquo;this&rsquo; 9
&rsquo;that&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thats not much help, a couple of welcomes in there, but
no indication of which are keys, and which are values, its
just a listed array dump and, in this case, not particularly
helpful. The trick here, is to use a reference to the data
structure:</p>

<p>DB&lt;13&gt; x data 0 HASH(0x8194bc4) &rsquo;Hello
World&rsquo; =&gt; &rsquo;zip&rsquo; &rsquo;jerry&rsquo;
=&gt; &rsquo;welcome&rsquo; &rsquo;this&rsquo; =&gt;
&rsquo;that&rsquo; &rsquo;tom&rsquo; =&gt; &rsquo;and&rsquo;
&rsquo;welcome&rsquo; =&gt; undef</p>

<p>The reference is truly dumped and we can finally see
what were dealing with. Our quoting was perfectly valid but
wrong for our purposes, with and jerry being treated as 2
separate words rather than a phrase, thus throwing the
evenly paired hash structure out of alignment.</p>

<p>The -w switch would have told us about this, had we used
it at the start, and saved us a lot of trouble:</p>

<p>&gt; perl -w data Odd number of elements in hash
assignment at ./data line 5.</p>

<p>We fix our quoting: tom =&gt; q(and jerry), and run it
again, this time we get our expected output:</p>

<p>&gt; perl -w data Hello World</p>

<p>While were here, take a closer look at the x command,
its really useful and will merrily dump out nested
references, complete objects, partial objects - just about
whatever you throw at it:</p>

<p>Let s make a quick object and x-plode it, first well
start the debugger: it wants some form of input from STDIN,
so we give it something non-committal, a zero:</p>

<p>&gt; perl -de 0 Default die handler restored.</p>

<p>Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07 Editor
support available.</p>

<p>Enter h or &lsquo;h h&rsquo; for help, or &lsquo;man
perldebug&rsquo; for more help.</p>

<p>main::(-e:1): 0</p>

<p>Now build an on-the-fly object over a couple of lines
(note the backslash):</p>

<p>DB&lt;1&gt; $obj =
bless({&rsquo;unique_id&rsquo;=&gt;&rsquo;123&rsquo;,
&rsquo;attr&rsquo;=&gt; cont: {&rsquo;col&rsquo; =&gt;
&rsquo;black&rsquo;, &rsquo;things&rsquo; =&gt; [qw(this
that etc)]}}, &rsquo;MY_class&rsquo;)</p>

<p>And lets have a look at it:</p>

<p>DB&lt;2&gt; x $obj 0 MY_class=HASH(0x828ad98)
&rsquo;attr&rsquo; =&gt; HASH(0x828ad68) &rsquo;col&rsquo;
=&gt; &rsquo;black&rsquo; &rsquo;things&rsquo; =&gt;
ARRAY(0x828abb8) 0 &rsquo;this&rsquo; 1 &rsquo;that&rsquo; 2
&rsquo;etc&rsquo; &rsquo;unique_id&rsquo; =&gt; 123
DB&lt;3&gt;</p>

<p>Useful, huh? You can eval nearly anything in there, and
experiment with bits of code or regexes until the cows come
home:</p>

<p>DB&lt;3&gt; @data = qw(this that the other atheism
leather theory scythe)</p>

<p>DB&lt;4&gt; p &rsquo;saw -&gt; &rsquo;.($cnt += map {
print &quot;:$_0 } grep(/the/, sort @data)) atheism leather
other scythe the theory saw -&gt; 6</p>

<p>If you want to see the command History, type an H:</p>

<p>DB&lt;5&gt; H 4: p &rsquo;saw -&gt; &rsquo;.($cnt += map
{ print &quot;:$_0 } grep(/the/, sort @data)) 3: @data =
qw(this that the other atheism leather theory scythe) 2: x
$obj 1: $obj =
bless({&rsquo;unique_id&rsquo;=&gt;&rsquo;123&rsquo;,
&rsquo;attr&rsquo;=&gt; {&rsquo;col&rsquo; =&gt;
&rsquo;black&rsquo;, &rsquo;things&rsquo; =&gt; [qw(this
that etc)]}}, &rsquo;MY_class&rsquo;) DB&lt;5&gt;</p>

<p>And if you want to repeat any previous command, use the
exclamation: !:</p>

<p>DB&lt;5&gt; !4 p &rsquo;saw -&gt; &rsquo;.($cnt += map {
print &quot;$_0 } grep(/the/, sort @data)) atheism leather
other scythe the theory saw -&gt; 12</p>

<p>For more on references see perlref and perlreftut</p>

<p>Stepping through code Here s a simple program which
converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit, it too has a
problem:</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict;</p>

<p>my $arg = $ARGV[0] || &rsquo;-c20&rsquo;;</p>

<p>if ($arg =~ /^&minus;(c|f)((&minus;|+)*+(.+)*)$/) { my
($deg, $num) = ($1, $2); my ($in, $out) = ($num, $num); if
($deg eq &rsquo;c&rsquo;) { $deg = &rsquo;f&rsquo;; $out =
&amp;c2f($num); } else { $deg = &rsquo;c&rsquo;; $out =
&amp;f2c($num); } $out = sprintf(&rsquo;%0.2f&rsquo;, $out);
$out =~ s/^((&minus;|+)*+).0+$/$1/; print &quot;$out $deg0;
} else { print &quot;Usage: $0 -[c|f] num0; } exit;</p>

<p>sub f2c { my $f = shift; my $c = 5 * $f - 32 / 9; return
$c; }</p>

<p>sub c2f { my $c = shift; my $f = 9 * $c / 5 + 32; return
$f; }</p>

<p>For some reason, the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
fails to return the expected output. This is what it
does:</p>

<p>&gt; temp -c0.72 33.30 f</p>

<p>&gt; temp -f33.3 162.94 c</p>

<p>Not very consistent! Well set a breakpoint in the code
manually and run it under the debugger to see what s going
on. A breakpoint is a flag, to which the debugger will run
without interruption, when it reaches the breakpoint, it
will stop execution and offer a prompt for further
interaction. In normal use, these debugger commands are
completely ignored, and they are safe - if a little messy,
to leave in production code.</p>

<p>my ($in, $out) = ($num, $num); $DB::single=2; # insert
at line 9! if ($deg eq &rsquo;c&rsquo;) ...</p>

<p>&gt; perl -d temp -f33.3 Default die handler
restored.</p>

<p>Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07 Editor
support available.</p>

<p>Enter h or &lsquo;h h&rsquo; for help, or &lsquo;man
perldebug&rsquo; for more help.</p>

<p>main::(temp:4): my $arg = $ARGV[0] ||
&rsquo;-c100&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Well simply continue down to our pre-set breakpoint with
a c:</p>

<p>DB&lt;1&gt; c main::(temp:10): if ($deg eq
&rsquo;c&rsquo;) {</p>

<p>Followed by a view command to see where we are:</p>

<p>DB&lt;1&gt; v 7: my ($deg, $num) = ($1, $2); 8: my ($in,
$out) = ($num, $num); 9: $DB::single=2; 10==&gt; if ($deg eq
&rsquo;c&rsquo;) { 11: $deg = &rsquo;f&rsquo;; 12: $out =
&amp;c2f($num); 13 } else { 14: $deg = &rsquo;c&rsquo;; 15:
$out = &amp;f2c($num); 16 }</p>

<p>And a print to show what values were currently
using:</p>

<p>DB&lt;1&gt; p $deg, $num f33.3</p>

<p>We can put another break point on any line beginning
with a colon, we ll use line 17 as thats just as we come out
of the subroutine, and wed like to pause there later on:</p>

<p>DB&lt;2&gt; b 17</p>

<p>Theres no feedback from this, but you can see what
breakpoints are set by using the list L command:</p>

<p>DB&lt;3&gt; L temp: 17: print &quot;$out $deg0; break if
(1)</p>

<p>Note that to delete a breakpoint you use d or D.</p>

<p>Now we ll continue down into our subroutine, this time
rather than by line number, well use the subroutine name,
followed by the now familiar v:</p>

<p>DB&lt;3&gt; c f2c main::f2c(temp:30): my $f = shift;</p>

<p>DB&lt;4&gt; v 24: exit; 25 26 sub f2c { 27==&gt; my $f =
shift; 28: my $c = 5 * $f - 32 / 9; 29: return $c; 30 } 31
32 sub c2f { 33: my $c = shift;</p>

<p>Note that if there was a subroutine call between us and
line 29, and we wanted to single-step through it, we could
use the s command, and to step over it we would use n which
would execute the sub, but not descend into it for
inspection. In this case though, we simply continue down to
line 29:</p>

<p>DB&lt;4&gt; c 29 main::f2c(temp:29): return $c;</p>

<p>And have a look at the return value:</p>

<p>DB&lt;5&gt; p $c 162.944444444444</p>

<p>This is not the right answer at all, but the sum looks
correct. I wonder if its anything to do with operator
precedence? We ll try a couple of other possibilities with
our sum:</p>

<p>DB&lt;6&gt; p (5 * $f - 32 / 9) 162.944444444444</p>

<p>DB&lt;7&gt; p 5 * $f - (32 / 9) 162.944444444444</p>

<p>DB&lt;8&gt; p (5 * $f) - 32 / 9 162.944444444444</p>

<p>DB&lt;9&gt; p 5 * ($f - 32) / 9 0.722222222222221</p>

<p>:-) that s more like it! Ok, now we can set our return
variable and well return out of the sub with an r:</p>

<p>DB&lt;10&gt; $c = 5 * ($f - 32) / 9</p>

<p>DB&lt;11&gt; r scalar context return from main::f2c:
0.722222222222221</p>

<p>Looks good, lets just continue off the end of the
script:</p>

<p>DB&lt;12&gt; c 0.72 c Debugged program terminated. Use q
to quit or R to restart, use O inhibit_exit to avoid
stopping after program termination, h q, h R or h O to get
additional info.</p>

<p>A quick fix to the offending line (insert the missing
parentheses) in the actual program and were finished.</p>

<p>Placeholder for a, w, t, T Actions, watch variables,
stack traces etc.: on the TODO list.</p>

<p>a</p>

<p>w</p>

<p>t</p>

<p>T</p>

<p>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS Ever wanted to know what a regex
looked like? Youll need perl compiled with the DEBUGGING
flag for this one:</p>

<p>&gt; perl -Dr -e &rsquo;/^pe(a)*rl$/i&rsquo; Compiling
REx &lsquo;^pe(a)*rl$&rsquo; size 17 first at 2 rarest char
at 0 1: BOL(2) 2: EXACTF &lt;pe&gt;(4) 4: CURLYN[1]

support.</p>

<p>EXECUTING...</p>

<p>Freeing REx: &lsquo;^pe(a)*rl$&rsquo;</p>

<p>Did you really want to know? :-) For more gory details
on getting regular expressions to work, have a look at
perlre, perlretut, and to decode the mysterious labels (BOL
and CURLYN, etc. above), see perldebguts.</p>

<p>OUTPUT TIPS To get all the output from your error log,
and not miss any messages via helpful operating system
buffering, insert a line like this, at the start of your
script:</p>

<p>$|=1;</p>

<p>To watch the tail of a dynamically growing logfile,
(from the command line):</p>

<p>tail -f $error_log</p>

<p>Wrapping all die calls in a handler routine can be
useful to see how, and from where, theyre being called,
perlvar has more information:</p>

<p>BEGIN { $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { require Carp;
Carp::confess(@_) } }</p>

<p>Various useful techniques for the redirection of STDOUT
and STDERR filehandles are explained in perlopentut and
perlfaq8.</p>

<p>CGI Just a quick hint here for all those CGI programmers
who cant figure out how on earth to get past that waiting
for input prompt, when running their CGI script from the
command-line, try something like this:</p>

<p>&gt; perl -d my_cgi.pl -nodebug</p>

<p>Of course CGI and perlfaq9 will tell you more.</p>

<p>GUIs The command line interface is tightly integrated
with an emacs extension and theres a vi interface too.</p>

<p>You dont have to do this all on the command line,
though, there are a few GUI options out there. The nice
thing about these is you can wave a mouse over a variable
and a dump of its data will appear in an appropriate window,
or in a popup balloon, no more tiresome typing of x $varname
:-)</p>

<p>In particular have a hunt around for the following:</p>

<p>ptkdb perlTK based wrapper for the built-in debugger</p>

<p>ddd data display debugger</p>

<p>PerlDevKit and PerlBuilder are NT specific</p>

<p>NB. (more info on these and others would be
appreciated).</p>

<p>SUMMARY Weve seen how to encourage good coding practices
with use strict and -w. We can run the perl debugger perl -d
scriptname to inspect your data from within the perl
debugger with the p and x commands. You can walk through
your code, set breakpoints with b and step through that code
with s or n, continue with c and return from a sub with r.
Fairly intuitive stuff when you get down to it.</p>

<p>There is of course lots more to find out about, this has
just scratched the surface. The best way to learn more is to
use perldoc to find out more about the language, to read the
on-line help (perldebug is probably the next place to go),
