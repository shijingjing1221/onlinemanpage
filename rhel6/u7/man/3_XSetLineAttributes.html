<p>XSetLineAttributes(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS
XSetLineAttributes(3)</p>

<p>NAME XSetLineAttributes, XSetDashes - GC convenience
routines</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XSetLineAttributes(Display *display, GC gc,
unsigned int line_width, int line_style, int cap_style, int
join_style);</p>

<p>int XSetDashes(Display *display, GC gc, int dash_offset,
char dash_list[], int n);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS cap_style Specifies the line-style and
cap-style you want to set for the specified GC. You can pass
CapNotLast, CapButt, CapRound, or CapProjecting.</p>

<p>dash_list Specifies the dash-list for the dashed
line-style you want to set for the specified GC.</p>

<p>dash_offset Specifies the phase of the pattern for the
dashed line-style you want to set for the specified GC.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>join_style Specifies the line join-style you want to set
for the speci- fied GC. You can pass JoinMiter, JoinRound,
or JoinBevel.</p>

<p>line_style Specifies the line-style you want to set for
the specified GC. You can pass LineSolid, LineOnOffDash, or
LineDou- bleDash.</p>

<p>line_width Specifies the line-width you want to set for
the specified GC.</p>

<p>n Specifies the number of elements in dash_list.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XSetLineAttributes function sets the
line drawing components in the specified GC.</p>

<p>XSetLineAttributes can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XSetDashes function sets the dash-offset and
dash-list attributes for dashed line styles in the specified
GC. There must be at least one element in the specified
dash_list, or a BadValue error results. The initial and
alternating elements (second, fourth, and so on) of the
dash_list are the even dashes, and the others are the odd
dashes. Each element specifies a dash length in pixels. All
of the elements must be nonzero, or a BadValue error
results. Specifying an odd-length list is equivalent to
specifying the same list concatenated with itself to pro-
duce an even-length list.</p>

<p>The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern,
specifying how many pixels into the dash-list the pattern
should actually begin in any sin- gle graphics request.
Dashing is continuous through path elements com- bined with
a join-style but is reset to the dash-offset between each
sequence of joined lines.</p>

<p>The unit of measure for dashes is the same for the
ordinary coordinate system. Ideally, a dash length is
measured along the slope of the line, but implementations
are only required to match this ideal for horizontal and
vertical lines. Failing the ideal semantics, it is sug-
gested that the length be measured along the major axis of
the line. The major axis is defined as the x axis for lines
drawn at an angle of between -45 and +45 degrees or between
135 and 225 degrees from the x axis. For all other lines,
the major axis is the y axis.</p>

<p>XSetDashes can generate BadAlloc, BadGC, and BadValue
errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the
requested resource or server memory.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
