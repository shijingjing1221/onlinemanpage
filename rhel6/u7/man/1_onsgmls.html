<p>NAME onsgmls - An SGML/XML parser and validator</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS onsgmls [-BCdeghlnpRrsuvx] [-alinktype]
[-Aarchitecture] [-bbctf] [-csysid...] [-Ddirectory]
[-Emax_errors] [-ffile] [-iname] [-ooutput_option...]
[-tfile] [-wwarning_type...] [sysid...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION onsgmls parses and validates the SGML
document whose document entity is specified by the system
identifiers</p>

<p>and prints on the standard output a simple text
representation of its Element Structure Information Set.
(This is the information set which a structure-controlled
conforming SGML application should act upon.) If more than
one system identifier is specified, then the corresponding
entities will be concatenated to form the document entity.
Thus the document entity may be spread among several files;
for example, the SGML declaration, prolog and document
instance set could each be in a separate file. If no system
identifiers are specified, then onsgmls will read the
document entity from the standard input. A command line
system identifier of - can be used to refer to the standard
input. (Normally in a system identifier, &lt;OSFD&gt;0 is
used to refer to standard input.)</p>

<p>Part of an SGML System Conforming to International
Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language.
An SGML Extended Facilities system conforming to Annex A of
Internal Standard ISO/IEC 10744 -- Hypermedia/Time-based
Structuring Language</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<p>-alinktype, --activate=linktype Make link type linktype
active. Not all ESIS information is output in this case: the
active LPDs are not explicitly reported, although each link
attribute is qualified with its link type name; there is no
information about result elements; when there are multiple
link rules applicable to the current element, onsgmls always
chooses the first.</p>

<p>-Aarchitecture, --architecture=architecture Parse with
respect to architecture architecture.</p>

<p>-bbctf, --bctf=bctf, -bencoding, --encoding=encoding
This determines the encoding used for output. If in fixed
character set mode it specifies the name of an encoding; if
not, it specifies the name of a BCTF.</p>

<p>-B, --batch_mode Batch mode. Parse each</p>

<p>specified on the command line separately, rather than
concatenating them. This is useful mainly with -s.</p>

<p>If -tfilename is also specified, then the specified
filename will be prefixed to the sysid to make the filename
for the RAST result for each sysid.</p>

<p>-csysid, --catalog=sysid Map public identifiers and
entity names to system identifiers using the catalog entry
file whose system identifier is sysid. Multiple -c options
are allowed. If there is a catalog entry file called catalog
in the same place as the document entity, it will be
searched for immediately after those specified by -c.</p>

<p>-C, --catalogs The</p>

<p>arguments specify catalog files rather than the document
entity. The document entity is specified by the first
DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.</p>

<p>-Ddirectory, --directory=directory Search directory for
files specified in system identifiers. Multiple -D options
are allowed. See the description of the osfile storage
manager for more information about file searching.</p>

<p>-e, --open-entities Describe open entities in error
messages. Error messages always include the position of the
most recently opened external entity.</p>

<p>-Emax_errors, --max-errors=max_errors onsgmls will exit
after max_errors errors. If max_errors is 0, there is no
limit on the number of errors. The default is 200.</p>

<p>-ffile, --error-file=file Redirect errors to file. This
is useful mainly with shells that do not support redirection
of stderr.</p>

<p>-g, --open-elements Show the generic identifiers of open
elements in error messages.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show a help message and exit.</p>

<p>-iname, --include=name Pretend that</p>

<p>&lt;!ENTITY % name &quot;INCLUDE&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>occurs at the start of the document type declaration
subset in the SGML document entity. Since repeated
definitions of an entity are ignored, this definition will
take precedence over any other definitions of this entity in
the document type declaration. Multiple -i options are
allowed. If the SGML declaration replaces the reserved name
INCLUDE then the new reserved name will be the replacement
text of the entity. Typically the document type declaration
will contain</p>

<p>&lt;!ENTITY % name &quot;IGNORE&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>and will use %name; in the status keyword specification
of a marked section declaration. In this case the effect of
the option will be to cause the marked section not to be
ignored.</p>

<p>-n, --error-numbers Show message numbers in error
messages.</p>

<p>-ooutput_option, --option=output_option Output
additional information according to output_option:</p>

<p>entity Output definitions of all general entities not
just for data or subdoc entities that are referenced or
named in an ENTITY or ENTITIES attribute.</p>

<p>id Distinguish attributes whose declared value is
ID.</p>

<p>line Output L commands giving the current line number
and filename.</p>

<p>included Output an i command for included
sub-elements.</p>

<p>empty Output an e command for elements which are not
allowed to have an end-tag, that is those with a declared
content of empty or with a content reference attribute.</p>

<p>notation-sysid Output an f command before an N command,
if a system identifier could be generated for that
notation.</p>

<p>nonsgml In fixed character set mode, output escape
sequences for non-SGML data characters. Non-SGML data
characters can result from numeric character references.</p>

<p>data-attribute Output the notation name and attributes
for DATA attributes. Otherwise, DATA attributes are treated
like CDATA attributes. For more details see clause 4.4.3 of
Annex K of ISO 8879.</p>

<p>comment Output an _ command with the contents of a
comment. Multiple comments in a single comment declaration
will result in multiple distinct _ commands, just as if the
comments were each in a separate comment declaration.</p>

<p>omitted Output an o command before a command which was
implied by the input document, but omitted from the actual
markup. This currently affects (,), and A commands.</p>

<p>tagomit As omitted, but only for ( and ) commands.</p>

<p>attromit As omitted, but only for A commands.</p>

<p>Multiple -o options are allowed.</p>

<p>-p, --only-prolog Parse only the prolog. onsgmls will
exit after parsing the document type declaration. Implies
-s.</p>

<p>-R, --restricted Restrict file reading. This option is
intended for use with onsgmls-based Web tools (e.g. CGI
scripts) to prevent reading of arbitrary files on the Web
server. With this option enabled, onsgmls will not read any
local files unless they are located in a directory (or
subdirectory) specified by the -D option or included in the
SGML_SEARCH_PATH environment variable. As a further security
precaution, this option limits filesnames to the characters
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, &acute;?&acute;, &acute;.&acute;,
&acute;_&acute;, &acute;-&acute; and does not allow
filenames containing &quot;..&quot;. On systems with MS-DOS
file names &acute;:&acute; and &acute;&acute; are also
allowed.</p>

<p>-s, --no-output Suppress output. Error messages will
still be printed.</p>

<p>-tfile, --rast-file=file Output to file the RAST result
as defined by ISO/IEC 13673:1995 (actually this isn&acute;t
quite an IS yet; this implements the Intermediate
Editor&acute;s Draft of 1994/08/29, with changes to
implement ISO/IEC JTC1/SC18/WG8 N1777). The normal output is
not produced.</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version number.</p>

<p>-wtype, --warning=type Control warnings and errors.
Multiple -w options are allowed. The following values of
type enable warnings:</p>

<p>xml Warn about constructs that are not allowed by
XML.</p>

<p>mixed Warn about mixed content models that do not allow
#PCDATA anywhere.</p>

<p>sgmldecl Warn about various dubious constructions in the
SGML declaration.</p>

<p>should Warn about various recommendations made in ISO
8879 that the document does not comply with.
(Recommendations are expressed with &quot;should&quot;, as
distinct from requirements which are usually expressed with
&quot;shall&quot;.)</p>

<p>default Warn about defaulted references.</p>

<p>duplicate Warn about duplicate entity declarations.</p>

<p>undefined Warn about undefined elements: elements used
in the DTD but not defined.</p>

<p>unclosed Warn about unclosed start and end-tags.</p>

<p>empty Warn about empty start and end-tags.</p>

<p>net Warn about net-enabling start-tags and null
end-tags.</p>

<p>min-tag Warn about minimized start and end-tags.
Equivalent to combination of unclosed, empty and net
warnings.</p>

<p>unused-map Warn about unused short reference maps: maps
that are declared with a short reference mapping declaration
but never used in a short reference use declaration in the
DTD.</p>

<p>unused-param Warn about parameter entities that are
defined but not used in a DTD. Unused internal parameter
entities whose text is INCLUDE or IGNORE won&acute;t get the
warning.</p>

<p>notation-sysid Warn about notations for which no system
identifier could be generated.</p>

<p>all Warn about conditions that should usually be avoided
(in the opinion of the author). Equivalent to: mixed,
should, default, undefined, sgmldecl, unused-map,
unused-param, empty and unclosed.</p>

<p>immediate-recursion Warn about immediately recursive
elements. For more detais see clause 2.2.5 of Annex K of ISO
8879.</p>

<p>fully-declared Warn if the document instance fails to be
fully declared. This has the effect of changing the SGML
declaration to specify IMPLYDEF ATTLIST NO ELEMENT NO ENTITY
NO NOTATION NO. For more details see clause 2.2.1 of Annex K
of ISO 8879.</p>

<p>fully-tagged Warn if the document instance fails to be
fully-tagged. This has the effect of changing the SGML
declaration to specify DATATAG NO, RANK NO, OMITTAG NO,
SHORTTAG STARTTAG EMPTY NO and SHORTTAG ATTRIB OMITNAME NO.
For more details see clause 2.2.2 of Annex K of ISO
8879.</p>

<p>amply-tagged, amply-tagged-recursive Warn if the
doucment instance fails to be amply-tagged. Implicitly
defined elements may be immediately recurisve if
amply-tagged-recursive is specified. This has the effect of
changing the SGML declaration to specify DATATAG NO, RANK
NO, OMITTAG NO, SHORTTAG ATTRIB OMITNAME NO and either
IMPLYDEF ELEMENT ANYOTHER or IMPLYDEF ELEMENT YES. For more
details see clause 2.2.4 of Annex K of ISO 8879.</p>

<p>type-valid Warn if the document instance fails to be
type-valid. This has the effect of changing the SGML
declaration to specify VALIDITY YES. For more details see
clause 2.2.3 of Annex K of ISO 8879.</p>

<p>entity-ref Warn about references to non-predefined
entities. This has the effect of changing the SGML
declaration to specify ENTITIES REF NONE. For more details
see clause 2.3.2 of Annex K of ISO 8879.</p>

<p>external-entity-ref Warn about references to external
entities. This includes references to an external DTD
subset. This has the effect of changing the SGML declaration
to specify ENTITIES REF INTERNAL. For more details see
clause 2.3.3 of Annex K of ISO 8879.</p>

<p>integral Warn if the document instance is not integrally
stored. This has the effect of changing the SGML declaration
to specify ENTITIES INTEGRAL YES. For more details see
clause 2.3.1 of Annex K of ISO 8879.</p>

<p>A warning can be disabled by using its name prefixed
with no-. Thus -wall -wno-duplicate will enable all warnings
except those about duplicate entity declarations.</p>

<p>The following values for warning_type disable
errors:</p>

<p>no-idref Do not give an error for an ID reference value
which no element has as its ID. The effect will be as if
each attribute declared as an ID reference value had been
declared as a name.</p>

<p>no-significant Do not give an error when a character
that is not a significant character in the reference
concrete syntax occurs in a literal in the SGML declaration.
This may be useful in conjunction with certain buggy test
suites.</p>

<p>no-valid Do not require the document to be type-valid.
This has the effect of changing the SGML declaration to
specify VALIDITY NOASSERT and IMPLYDEF ATTLIST YES ELEMENT
YES. An option of -wvalid has the effect of changing the
SGML declaration to specify VALIDITY TYPE and IMPLYDEF
ATTLIST NO ELEMENT NO. If neither -wvalid nor -wno-valid are
specified, then the VALIDITY and IMPLYDEF specified in the
SGML declaration will be used.</p>

<p>no-afdr Do not give errors when AFDR meta-DTD notation
features are used in the DTD. These errors are normally
produced when parsing the DTD, but suppressed when parsing
meta-DTDs.</p>

<p>-x, --references Show information about relevant clauses
(from ISO 8879:1986) in error messages.</p>

<p>The following options are also supported for backward
compatibility with sgmls:</p>

<p>-d Same as -wduplicate.</p>

<p>-l Same as -oline.</p>

<p>-msysid Same as -c.</p>

<p>-r Same as -wdefault.</p>

<p>-u Same as -wundef.</p>
