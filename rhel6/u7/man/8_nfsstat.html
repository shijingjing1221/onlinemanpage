<p>NAME nfsstat - list NFS statistics</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nfsstat [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The nfsstat displays statistics kept about
NFS client and server activ- ity.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -s, --server Print only server-side statistics.
The default is to print both server and client
statistics.</p>

<p>-c, --client Print only client-side statistics.</p>

<p>-n, --nfs Print only NFS statistics. The default is to
print both NFS and RPC information.</p>

<p>-2 Print only NFS v2 statistics. The default is to only
print information about the versions of NFS that have
non-zero counts.</p>

<p>-3 Print only NFS v3 statistics. The default is to only
print information about the versions of NFS that have
non-zero counts.</p>

<p>-4 Print only NFS v4 statistics. The default is to only
print information about the versions of NFS that have
non-zero counts.</p>

<p>-m, --mounts Print information about each of the mounted
NFS file systems.</p>

<p>If this option is used, all other options are
ignored.</p>

<p>-r, --rpc Print only RPC statistics.</p>

<p>-o facility Display statistics for the specified
facility, which must be one of:</p>

<p>nfs NFS protocol information, split up by RPC call.</p>

<p>rpc General RPC information.</p>

<p>net Network layer statistics, such as the number of
received packets, number of TCP connections, etc.</p>

<p>fh Usage information on the server s file handle cache,
including the total number of lookups, and the number of
hits and misses.</p>

<p>rc Usage information on the server s request reply
cache, including the total number of lookups, and the number
of hits and misses.</p>

<p>all Display all of the above facilities.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose This is equivalent to -o all.</p>

<p>-l, --list Print information in list form.</p>

<p>-S, --since file Instead of printing current statistics,
nfsstat imports statis- tics from file and displays the
difference between those and the current statistics. Valid
input files may be in the form of /proc/net/rpc/nfs (raw
client stats), /proc/net/rpc/nfsd (raw server stats), or
saved output from nfsstat itself (client and/or server
stats). Any statistics missing from a saved nfs- stat output
file are treated as zeroes.</p>

<p>-Z[interval], --sleep=[interval] Instead of printing
current statistics and immediately exiting, nfsstat takes a
snapshot of the current statistics and pauses until it
receives SIGINT (typically from Ctrl-C), at which point it
takes another snapshot and displays the difference between
the two. If interval is specified, nfsstat will print the
num- ber of NFS calls made since the previous report. Stats
will be printed repeatedly every interval seconds.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES nfsstat -o all -234 Show all information about
all versions of NFS.</p>

<p>nfsstat --verbose -234 Same as above.</p>

<p>nfsstat -o all Show all information about active
versions of NFS.</p>

<p>nfsstat --nfs --server -3 Show statistics for NFS
version 3 server.</p>

<p>nfsstat -m Show information about mounted NFS
filesystems.</p>

<p>DISPLAY The Flags output from the -m option is the same
as the flags give to the mount command.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/rpc/nfsd procfs-based interface to
kernel NFS server statistics.</p>

<p>/proc/net/rpc/nfs procfs-based interface to kernel NFS
client statistics.</p>

<p>/proc/mounts procfs-based interface to the mounted
filesystems.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rpc.nfsd(8). nfs(5).</p>

<p>BUGS The default output has been changed. To get the old
default output you must run nfsstat --auto -2.</p>

<p>The function of the -v and -a options have changed. The
-a option is now reserved for future use. The -v does what
the -a option used to do, and the new -[234] options replace
the -v option.</p>

<p>The Display section should be more complete.</p>

<p>Further bugs can be found or reported at
http://nfs.sf.net/.</p>
