<p>AIO_CANCEL(3) Linux Programmer s Manual
AIO_CANCEL(3)</p>

<p>NAME aio_cancel - cancel an outstanding asynchronous I/O
request</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;aio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int aio_cancel(int fd, struct aiocb *aiocbp);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The aio_cancel() function attempts to cancel
outstanding asynchronous I/O requests for the file
descriptor fd. If aiocbp is NULL, all such requests are
canceled. Otherwise, only the request described by the
control block pointed to by aiocbp is canceled.</p>

<p>Normal asynchronous notification occurs for canceled
requests. The request return status is set to -1, and the
request error status is set to ECANCELED. The control block
of requests that cannot be canceled is not changed.</p>

<p>If aiocbp is not NULL, and fd differs from the file
descriptor with which the asynchronous operation was
initiated, unspecified results occur.</p>

<p>Which operations are cancellable is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE This function returns AIO_CANCELED if all
requests were successfully canceled. It returns
AIO_NOTCANCELED when at least one of the requests specified
was not canceled because it was in progress. In this case
one may check the status of individual requests using
aio_error(3). This function returns AIO_ALLDONE when all
requests had been completed already before this call. When
some error occurs, -1 is returned, and errno is set
appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>
