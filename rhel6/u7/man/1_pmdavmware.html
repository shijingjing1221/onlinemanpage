<p>NAME pmdavmware - VMware performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdavmware is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values from a (possibly
remote) VMware virtualisation host.</p>

<p>This implementation uses the VMare Perl API (refer to
the online docs at
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/viperltoolkit).
VIPerl is a prerequisite for this PMDA, it needs to be
installed and configured before attempting to use this
agent. It is highly recommended that you test your VIPerl
installation using the demo programs that are shipped with
VIPerl, before attempting to use this PMDA.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION In order to access performance data using
the VIPerl API, it is necessary to be able to login to the
metrics source. Hence, a valid VMware server name, user name
and pass word are needed by the PMDA. These can be passed in
on the command line (via the pmcd.conf file) or via a
vmware.conf file in the PMDA directory.</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/vmware # [ edit vmware.conf ]</p>

<p>This file should contain three lines, such as:</p>

<p>$server = &rsquo;vm.server.net&rsquo;; $username =
&rsquo;XXXX&rsquo;; $password = &rsquo;YYYY&rsquo;;</p>

<p>Once this is setup, you can access the names and values
for the vmware performance metrics by doing the following as
root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/vmware # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/vmware # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdavmware is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/vmware/vmware.conf configuration
file for the pmdavmware agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/vmware/Install installation script for
the pmdavmware agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/vmware/Remove undo installation script
for the pmdavmware agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/vmware.log default log file for error
messages from pmdavmware</p>
