<p>SNMP_ALARM(3) Net-SNMP SNMP_ALARM(3)</p>

<p>NAME snmp_alarm_register, snmp_alarm_register_hr,
snmp_alarm_unregister - alarm functions</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;net-snmp/utilities.h&gt;</p>

<p>unsigned int snmp_alarm_register(unsigned int seconds,
unsigned int flags, SNMPAlarmCallback *f_callback, void
*clientarg);</p>

<p>unsigned int snmp_alarm_register_hr(struct timeval t,
unsigned int flags, SNMPAlarmCallback *f_callback, void
*clientarg);</p>

<p>void snmp_alarm_unregister(unsigned int reg);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These functions implement support for a
generic timer handling mecha- nism for multiple parts of an
application to register function call- backs to happen at a
particular time in the future.</p>

<p>USAGE The usage is fairly simple and straight-forward:
Simply create a func- tion you want called back at some
point in the future. The function definition should be
similar to:</p>

<p>void my_callback(unsigned int reg, void *clientarg);</p>

<p>Then, call snmp_alarm_register() to register your
callback to be called seconds from now. The flags field
should either be SA_REPEAT or NULL. If flags is set with
SA_REPEAT, then the registered callback function will be
called every seconds. If flags is NULL then the function
will only be called once and then removed from the alarm
system registra- tion.</p>

<p>The clientarg parameter in the registration function is
used only by the client function and is stored and passed
back directly to them on every call to the system.</p>

<p>The snmp_alarm_register() function returns a unique
unsigned int (which is also passed as the first argument of
each callback), which can then be used to remove the
callback from the queue at a later point in the future using
the snmp_alarm_unregister() function. If the
snmp_alarm_register() call fails it returns zero. In
particular, note that it is entirely permissible for an
alarm function to unregister itself.</p>

<p>The snmp_alarm_register_hr() function is identical in
operation to the snmp_alarm_register() function, but takes a
struct timeval as a first parameter, and schedules the
callback after the period represented by t (the letters hr
stand for &quot;high resolution&quot;). The operation of
this function is dependent on the provision of the
setitimer(2) system call by the operating system. If this
system call is not available, the alarm will be scheduled as
if snmp_alarm_register() had been called with a first
argument equal to the value of the tv_sec member of t. See,
however, the notes below.</p>

<p>INITIALIZATION The init_snmp() function initialises the
snmp_alarm subsystem by call- ing init_snmp_alarm() and then
init_alarm_post_config() to set up the first timer to
initialise the callback function. These two functions should
not be used directly by applications.</p>

<p>NOTES The default behaviour of the snmp_alarm subsystem
is to request SIGALRM signals from the operating system via
the alarm(2) or setitimer(2) sys- tem calls. This has the
disadvantage, however, that no other part of the application
can use the SIGLARM functionality (or, if some other part of
the application does use the SIGALRM functionality, the
snmp_alarm subsystem will not work correctly).</p>

<p>If your application runs a select(2)-based event loop,
however, there is no need to use SIGALRM for the snmp_alarm
subsystem, leaving it available for other parts of the
application. This is done by making the following call:</p>

<p>netsnmp_ds_set_boolean(NETSNMP_DS_LIBRARY_ID,
NETSNMP_DS_LIB_ALARM_DONT_USE_SIG, 1);</p>

<p>before calling init_snmp(). Then, snmp_select_info()
takes alarms into account when calculating the timeout value
to be used for select(2). All you need to do is call
run_alarms() when select(2) times out (return value of
zero). This is the approach taken in the agent; see snmpd.c.
Furthermore, when using this method, high resolution alarms
do not depend on the presence of the setitimer(2) system
call, although overall precision is of course still
determined by the underlying oper- ating system.
