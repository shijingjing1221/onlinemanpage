<p>WRITE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual WRITE(2)</p>

<p>NAME write - write to a file descriptor</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t
count);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION write() writes up to count bytes from the
buffer pointed buf to the file referred to by the file
descriptor fd.</p>

<p>The number of bytes written may be less than count if,
for example, there is insufficient space on the underlying
physical medium, or the RLIMIT_FSIZE resource limit is
encountered (see setrlimit(2)), or the call was interrupted
by a signal handler after having written less than count
bytes. (See also pipe(7).)</p>

<p>For a seekable file (i.e., one to which lseek(2) may be
applied, for example, a regular file) writing takes place at
the current file off- set, and the file offset is
incremented by the number of bytes actually written. If the
file was open(2)ed with O_APPEND, the file offset is first
set to the end of the file before writing. The adjustment of
the file offset and the write operation are performed as an
atomic step.</p>

<p>POSIX requires that a read(2) which can be proved to
occur after a write() has returned returns the new data.
Note that not all file sys- tems are POSIX conforming.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, the number of bytes written is
returned (zero indicates nothing was written). On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>If count is zero and fd refers to a regular file, then
write() may return a failure status if one of the errors
below is detected. If no errors are detected, 0 will be
returned without causing any other effect. If count is zero
and fd refers to a file other than a regular file, the
results are not specified.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The file descriptor fd refers to a file
other than a socket and has been marked non-blocking
(O_NONBLOCK), and the write would block.</p>

<p>EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK The file descriptor fd refers to a
socket and has been marked non-blocking (O_NONBLOCK), and
the write would block. POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to
be returned for this case, and does not require these
constants to have the same value, so a portable application
should check for both possibilities.</p>

<p>EBADF fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open
for writing.</p>

<p>EFAULT buf is outside your accessible address space.</p>

<p>EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds
the implementa- tion-defined maximum file size or the
processs file size limit, or to write at a position past the
maximum allowed offset.</p>

<p>EINTR The call was interrupted by a signal before any
data was writ- ten; see signal(7).</p>

<p>EINVAL fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable
for writing; or the file was opened with the O_DIRECT flag,
and either the address specified in buf, the value specified
in count, or the current file offset is not suitably
aligned.</p>

<p>EIO A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the
inode.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The device containing the file referred to by fd
has no room for the data.</p>

<p>EPIPE fd is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading
end is closed. When this happens the writing process will
also receive a SIG- PIPE signal. (Thus, the write return
value is seen only if the program catches, blocks or ignores
this signal.)</p>

<p>Other errors may occur, depending on the object
connected to fd.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>Under SVr4 a write may be interrupted and return EINTR
at any point, not just before any data is written.</p>

<p>NOTES A successful return from write() does not make any
guarantee that data has been committed to disk. In fact, on
some buggy implementations, it does not even guarantee that
space has successfully been reserved for the data. The only
way to be sure is to call fsync(2) after you are done
writing all your data.</p>

<p>If a write() is interrupted by a signal handler before
any bytes are written, then the call fails with the error
EINTR; if it is interrupted after at least one byte has been
written, the call succeeds, and returns the number of bytes
written.</p>
