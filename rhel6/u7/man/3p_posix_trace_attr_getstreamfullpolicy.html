<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_attr_getinherited,
posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy,
posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy,
posix_trace_attr_setinherited,
posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy,
posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy - retrieve and set the
behavior of a trace stream (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_attr_getinherited(const trace_attr_t
*restrict attr, int *restrict inheritancepolicy);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy(const trace_attr_t
*restrict attr, int *restrict logpolicy);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy(const
trace_attr_t *attr, int *streampolicy);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_attr_setinherited(trace_attr_t *attr,
int inheritancepolicy);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy(trace_attr_t
*attr, int logpolicy);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy(trace_attr_t
*attr, int streampolicy);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_attr_getinherited() and
posix_trace_attr_setinherited() functions, respectively,
shall get and set the inheritance policy stored in the
inheritance attribute for traced processes across the fork()
and spawn() operations. The inheritance attribute of the
attributes object pointed to by the attr argument shall be
set to one of the following values defined by manifest
constants in the &lt;trace.h&gt; header:</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD</p>

<p>After a fork() or spawn() operation, the child shall not
be traced, and tracing of the parent shall continue.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_INHERITED</p>

<p>After a fork() or spawn() operation, if the parent is
being traced, its child shall be concurrently traced using
the same trace stream.</p>

<p>The default value for the inheritance attribute is
POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy() and
posix_trace_attr_setlog- fullpolicy() functions,
respectively, shall get and set the trace log full policy
stored in the log-full-policy attribute of the attributes
object pointed to by the attr argument.</p>

<p>The log-full-policy attribute shall be set to one of the
following val- ues defined by manifest constants in the
&lt;trace.h&gt; header:</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_LOOP</p>

<p>The trace log shall loop until the associated trace
stream is stopped. This policy means that when the trace log
gets full, the file system shall reuse the resources
allocated to the old- est trace events that were recorded.
In this way, the trace log will always contain the most
recent trace events flushed.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL</p>

<p>The trace stream shall be flushed to the trace log until
the trace log is full. This condition can be deduced from
the posix_log_full_status member status (see the
posix_trace_sta- tus_info structure defined in
&lt;trace.h&gt;). The last recorded trace event shall be the
POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_APPEND</p>

<p>The associated trace stream shall be flushed to the
trace log without log size limitation. If the application
specifies POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the implementation shall
ignore the log-max- size attribute.</p>

<p>The default value for the log-full-policy attribute is
POSIX_TRACE_LOOP.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy() and
posix_trace_attr_set- streamfullpolicy() functions,
respectively, shall get and set the trace stream full policy
stored in the stream-full-policy attribute of the attributes
object pointed to by the attr argument.</p>

<p>The stream-full-policy attribute shall be set to one of
the following values defined by manifest constants in the
&lt;trace.h&gt; header:</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_LOOP</p>

<p>The trace stream shall loop until explicitly stopped by
the posix_trace_stop() function. This policy means that when
the trace stream is full, the trace system shall reuse the
resources allocated to the oldest trace events recorded. In
this way, the trace stream will always contain the most
recent trace events recorded.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL</p>

<p>The trace stream will run until the trace stream
resources are exhausted. Then the trace stream will stop.
This condition can be deduced from posix_stream_status and
posix_stream_full_status (see the posix_trace_status_info
structure defined in &lt;trace.h&gt;). When this trace
stream is read, a POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event shall be
reported after reporting the last recorded trace event. The
trace system shall reuse the resources allo- cated to any
trace events already reported-see the
posix_trace_getnext_event(), posix_trace_trygetnext_event(),
and posix_trace_timedgetnext_event() functions-or already
flushed for an active trace stream with log if the Trace Log
option is supported; see the posix_trace_flush() function.
The trace sys- tem shall restart the trace stream when it is
empty and may restart it sooner. A POSIX_TRACE_START trace
event shall be reported before reporting the next recorded
trace event.</p>

<p>POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH</p>

<p>If the Trace Log option is supported, this policy is
identical to the POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL trace stream full
policy except that the trace stream shall be flushed
regularly as if posix_trace_flush() had been explicitly
called. Defining this policy for an active trace stream
without log shall be invalid.</p>

<p>The default value for the stream-full-policy attribute
shall be POSIX_TRACE_LOOP for an active trace stream without
log.</p>

<p>If the Trace Log option is supported, the default value
for the stream- full-policy attribute shall be
POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH for an active trace stream with log.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
the corresponding error number.</p>

<p>If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getinherited()
function shall store the inheritance attribute value in the
object pointed to by inheritan- cepolicy. Otherwise, the
content of this object is undefined.</p>

<p>If successful, the posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy()
function shall store the log-full-policy attribute value in
the object pointed to by logpolicy. Otherwise, the content
of this object is undefined.</p>

<p>If successful, the
posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy() function shall store
the stream-full-policy attribute value in the object pointed
to by streampolicy. Otherwise, the content of this object is
undefined.</p>

<p>ERRORS These functions may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by at least one of the
arguments is invalid.</p>
