<p>NAME error::pass4 - systemtap pass-4 errors</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Errors that occur during pass 4
(compilation) have generally only a few causes:</p>

<p>kernel or OS version changes The systemtap runtime and
embedded-C fragments in the tapset library are designed to
be portable across a wide range of OS versions. However,
incompatibilities can occur when some OS changes occur, such
as kernel modifications that change func- tions, types, or
macros referenced by systemtap. Upstream
(git://sourceware.org/git/systemtap.git) builds of systemtap
are often quickly updated to include relevant fixes, so try
getting or making an updated build. If the issue persists,
report the problem to the systemtap developers.</p>

<p>buggy embedded-C code Embedded-C code in your own
guru-mode script cannot be checked by systemtap, and is
passed through verbatim to the compiler. Errors in such
snippets of code may be found during the pass-4 compiler
invocation, though may be hard to identify by the com- piler
errors.</p>

<p>incompatible embedded-C code The interface standards
between systemtap-generated code and embedded-C code
occasionally change. For example, before ver- sion 1.8,
arguments were passed using macros THIS-&gt;foo and
THIS-&gt;__retvalue but from version 1.8 onward, using
STAP_ARG_foo and STAP_RETVALUE. Adjust your embedded-C code
to current stan- dards, or use the stap --compatible=VERSION
option to make sys- temtap use a different one.</p>

<p>GATHERING MORE INFORMATION It may be necessary to run
systemtap with -k or -p3 to examine the gen- erated C code.
Increasing the verbosity of pass-4 with an option such as
--vp 0001 can also help pinpoint the problem.</p>
