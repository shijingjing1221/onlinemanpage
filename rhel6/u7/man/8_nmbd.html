<p>NAME nmbd - NetBIOS name server to provide NetBIOS over
IP naming services to clients</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS nmbd [-D] [-F] [-S] [-a] [-i] [-o] [-h] [-V]
[-d &lt;debug level&gt;] [-H &lt;lmhosts file&gt;] [-l
&lt;log directory&gt;] [-p &lt;port number&gt;] [-s
&lt;configuration file&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>nmbd is a server that understands and can reply to
NetBIOS over IP name service requests, like those produced
by SMB/CIFS clients such as Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT,
Windows 2000, Windows XP and LanManager clients. It also
participates in the browsing protocols which make up the
Windows &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot; view.</p>

<p>SMB/CIFS clients, when they start up, may wish to locate
an SMB/CIFS server. That is, they wish to know what IP
number a specified host is using.</p>

<p>Amongst other services, nmbd will listen for such
requests, and if its own NetBIOS name is specified it will
respond with the IP number of the host it is running on. Its
&quot;own NetBIOS name&quot; is by default the primary DNS
name of the host it is running on, but this can be
overridden by the netbios name in smb.conf. Thus nmbd will
reply to broadcast queries for its own name(s). Additional
names for nmbd to respond on can be set via parameters in
the smb.conf(5) configuration file.</p>

<p>nmbd can also be used as a WINS (Windows Internet Name
Server) server. What this basically means is that it will
act as a WINS database server, creating a database from name
registration requests that it receives and replying to
queries from clients for these names.</p>

<p>In addition, nmbd can act as a WINS proxy, relaying
broadcast queries from clients that do not understand how to
talk the WINS protocol to a WINS server.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D If specified, this parameter causes nmbd to
operate as a daemon. That is, it detaches itself and runs in
the background, fielding requests on the appropriate port.
By default, nmbd will operate as a daemon if launched from a
command shell. nmbd can also be operated from the inetd
meta-daemon, although this is not recommended.</p>

<p>-F If specified, this parameter causes the main nmbd
process to not daemonize, i.e. double-fork and disassociate
with the terminal. Child processes are still created as
normal to service each connection request, but the main
process does not exit. This operation mode is suitable for
running nmbd under process supervisors such as supervise and
svscan from Daniel J. Bernstein&rsquo;s daemontools package,
or the AIX process monitor.</p>

<p>-S If specified, this parameter causes nmbd to log to
standard output rather than a file.</p>

<p>-i If this parameter is specified it causes the server
to run &quot;interactively&quot;, not as a daemon, even if
the server is executed on the command line of a shell.
Setting this parameter negates the implicit daemon mode when
run from the command line. nmbd also logs to standard
output, as if the -S parameter had been given.</p>

<p>-h|--help Print a summary of command line options.</p>

<p>-H &lt;filename&gt; NetBIOS lmhosts file. The lmhosts
file is a list of NetBIOS names to IP addresses that is
loaded by the nmbd server and used via the name resolution
mechanism name resolve order described in smb.conf(5) to
resolve any NetBIOS name queries needed by the server. Note
that the contents of this file are NOT used by nmbd to
answer any name queries. Adding a line to this file affects
name NetBIOS resolution from this host ONLY.</p>

<p>The default path to this file is compiled into Samba as
part of the build process. Common defaults are
/usr/local/samba/lib/lmhosts, /usr/samba/lib/lmhosts or
/etc/samba/lmhosts. See the lmhosts(5) man page for details
on the contents of this file.</p>

<p>-d|--debuglevel=level level is an integer from 0 to 10.
The default value if this parameter is not specified is
0.</p>

<p>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to
the log files about the activities of the server. At level
0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged.
Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it
generates a small amount of information about operations
carried out.</p>

<p>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log
data, and should only be used when investigating a problem.
Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and
generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is
extremely cryptic.</p>

<p>Note that specifying this parameter here will override
the log level parameter in the smb.conf file.</p>

<p>-V|--version Prints the program version number.</p>

<p>-s|--configfile &lt;configuration file&gt; The file
specified contains the configuration details required by the
server. The information in this file includes
server-specific information such as what printcap file to
use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the
server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The
default configuration file name is determined at compile
time.</p>

<p>-l|--log-basename=logdirectory Base directory name for
log/debug files. The extension &quot;.progname&quot; will be
appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
file is never removed by the client.</p>

<p>-p &lt;UDP port number&gt; UDP port number is a positive
integer value. This option changes the default UDP port
number (normally 137) that nmbd responds to name queries on.
Don&rsquo;t use this option unless you are an expert, in
which case you won&rsquo;t need help!</p>

<p>FILES /etc/inetd.conf If the server is to be run by the
inetd meta-daemon, this file must contain suitable startup
information for the meta-daemon.</p>

<p>/etc/rc or whatever initialization script your system
uses).</p>

<p>If running the server as a daemon at startup, this file
will need to contain an appropriate startup sequence for the
server.</p>

<p>/etc/services If running the server via the meta-daemon
inetd, this file must contain a mapping of service name
(e.g., netbios-ssn) to service port (e.g., 139) and protocol
type (e.g., tcp).</p>

<p>/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf This is the default
location of the smb.conf(5) server configuration file. Other
common places that systems install this file are
/usr/samba/lib/smb.conf and /etc/samba/smb.conf.</p>

<p>When run as a WINS server (see the wins support
parameter in the smb.conf(5) man page), nmbd will store the
WINS database in the file wins.dat in the var/locks
directory configured under wherever Samba was configured to
install itself.</p>

<p>If nmbd is acting as a browse master (see the local
master parameter in the smb.conf(5) man page, nmbd will
store the browsing database in the file browse.dat in the
var/locks directory configured under wherever Samba was
configured to install itself.</p>

<p>SIGNALS To shut down an nmbd process it is recommended
that SIGKILL (-9) NOT be used, except as a last resort, as
this may leave the name database in an inconsistent state.
The correct way to terminate nmbd is to send it a SIGTERM
(-15) signal and wait for it to die on its own.</p>

<p>nmbd will accept SIGHUP, which will cause it to dump out
its namelists into the file namelist.debug in the
/usr/local/samba/var/locks directory (or the var/locks
directory configured under wherever Samba was configured to
install itself). This will also cause nmbd to dump out its
server database in the log.nmb file.</p>

<p>The debug log level of nmbd may be raised or lowered
using smbcontrol(1) (SIGUSR[1|2] signals are no longer used
since Samba 2.2). This is to allow transient problems to be
diagnosed, whilst still running at a normally low log
level.</p>

Samba suite.</p>

SMB) specification is available as a link from the Web page

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>

<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer.
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba
2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to
DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
Bokovoy.</p>
