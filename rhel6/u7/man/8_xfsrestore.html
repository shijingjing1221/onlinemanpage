<p>NAME xfsrestore - XFS filesystem incremental restore
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xfsrestore -h xfsrestore [ options ] -f source
[ -f source ... ] dest xfsrestore [ options ] - dest
xfsrestore -I [ subopt=value ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xfsrestore restores filesystems from dumps
produced by xfsdump(8). Two modes of operation are
available: simple and cumulative.</p>

<p>The default is simple mode. xfsrestore populates the
specified desti- nation directory, dest, with the files
contained in the dump media.</p>

<p>The -r option specifies the cumulative mode. Successive
invocations of xfsrestore are used to apply a
chronologically ordered sequence of delta dumps to a base
(level 0) dump. The contents of the filesystem at the time
each dump was produced is reproduced. This can involve
adding, deleting, renaming, linking, and unlinking files and
directo- ries.</p>

<p>A delta dump is defined as either an incremental dump
(xfsdump -l option with level &gt; 0) or a resumed dump
(xfsdump -R option). The deltas must be applied in the order
they were produced. Each delta applied must have been
produced with the previously applied delta as its base.</p>

<p>The options to xfsrestore are:</p>

<p>-a housekeeping Each invocation of xfsrestore creates a
directory called xfsre- storehousekeepingdir. This directory
is normally created directly under the dest directory. The
-a option allows the operator to specify an alternate
directory, housekeeping, in which xfsrestore creates the
xfsrestorehousekeeping directory. When performing a
cumulative (-r option) restore, each successive invocation
of xfs- restore must specify the same alternate
directory.</p>

<p>-b blocksize Specifies the blocksize, in bytes, to be
used for the restore. For other drives such as DAT or 8 mm ,
the same blocksize used for the xfsdump operation must be
specified to restore the tape. The default block size is
1Mb.</p>

<p>-c progname Use the specified program to alert the
operator when a media change is required. The alert program
is typically a script to send a mail or flash a window to
draw the operators attention.</p>

<p>-e Prevents xfsrestore from overwriting existing files
in the dest directory.</p>

<p>-f source [ -f source ... ] Specifies a source of the
dump to be restored. This can be the pathname of a device
(such as a tape drive), a regular file or a remote tape
drive (see rmt(8)). This option must be omitted if the
standard input option (a lone - preceding the dest
specifica- tion) is specified.</p>

<p>-i Selects interactive operation. Once the on-media
directory hier- archy has been read, an interactive dialogue
is begun. The operator uses a small set of commands to
peruse the directory hierarchy, selecting files and subtrees
for extraction. The available commands are given below.
Initially nothing is selected, except for those subtrees
specified with -s command line options.</p>

<p>ls [arg] List the entries in the current directory or
the specified directory, or the specified non-directory file
entry. Both the entrys original inode number and name are
displayed. Entries that are directo- ries are appended with
a /. Entries that have been selected for extraction are
prepended with a *.</p>

<p>cd [arg] Change the current working directory to the
speci- fied argument, or to the filesystem root directory if
no argument is specified.</p>

<p>pwd Print the pathname of the current directory, rela-
tive to the filesystem root.</p>

<p>add [arg] The current directory or specified file or
direc- tory within the current directory is selected for
extraction. If a directory is specified, then it and all its
descendents are selected. Entries that are selected for
extraction are prepended with a * when they are listed by
ls.</p>

<p>delete [arg] The current directory or specified file or
direc- tory within the current directory is deselected for
extraction. If a directory is specified, then it and all its
descendents are deselected. The most expedient way to
extract most of the files from a directory is to select the
directory and then dese- lect those files that are not
needed.</p>

<p>extract Ends the interactive dialogue, and causes all
selected subtrees to be restored.</p>

<p>quit xfsrestore ends the interactive dialogue and imme-
diately exits, even if there are files or subtrees selected
for extraction.</p>

<p>help List a summary of the available commands.</p>

<p>-m Use the minimal tape protocol. This option cannot be
used without specifying a blocksize to be used (see -b
option above).</p>

<p>-n file Allows xfsrestore to restore only files newer
than file. The mod- ification time of file (i.e., as
displayed with the ls -l command) is compared to the inode
modification time of each file on the source media (i.e., as
displayed with the ls -lc command). A file is restored from
media only if its inode modification time is greater than or
equal to the modification time of file.</p>

<p>-o Restore file and directory owner/group even if not
root. When run with an effective user id of root, xfsrestore
restores owner and group of each file and directory. When
run with any other effec- tive user id it does not, unless
this option is specified.</p>

<p>-p interval Causes progress reports to be printed at
intervals of interval seconds. The interval value is
approximate, xfsrestore will delay progress reports to avoid
undue processing overhead.</p>

<p>-q Source tape drive is a QIC tape. QIC tapes only use a
512 byte blocksize, for which xfsrestore must make special
allowances.</p>

<p>-r Selects the cumulative mode of operation.</p>

<p>-s subtree Specifies a subtree to restore. Any number of
-s options are allowed. The restore is constrained to the
union of all subtrees specified. Each subtree is specified
as a pathname relative to the restore dest. If a directory
is specified, the directory and all files beneath that
directory are restored.</p>

<p>-t Displays the contents of the dump, but does not
create or modify any files or directories. It may be
desirable to set the ver- bosity level to silent when using
this option.</p>

<p>-v verbosity -v subsys=verbosity[,subsys=verbosity,...]
Specifies the level of detail used for messages displayed
during the course of the restore. The verbosity argument can
be passed as either a string or an integer. If passed as a
string the following values may be used: silent, verbose,
trace, debug, or nitty. If passed as an integer, values from
0-5 may be used. The values 0-4 correspond to the strings
already listed. The value 5 can be used to produce even more
verbose debug output.</p>

<p>The first form of this option activates message logging
across all restore subsystems. The second form allows the
message logging level to be controlled on a per-subsystem
basis. The two forms can be combined (see the example
below). The argument subsys can take one of the following
values: general, proc, drive, media, inven- tory, and
tree.</p>

<p>For example, to restore the root filesystem with tracing
activated for all subsystems:</p>

<p># xfsrestore -v trace -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To enable debug-level tracing for drive and media
operations:</p>

<p># xfsrestore -v drive=debug,media=debug -f /dev/tape
/</p>

<p>To enable tracing for all subsystems, and debug level
tracing for drive operations only:</p>

<p># xfsrestore -v trace,drive=debug -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>-A Do not restore extended file attributes. When
restoring a filesystem managed within a DMF environment this
option should not be used. DMF stores file migration status
within extended attributes associated with each file. If
these attributes are not preserved when the filesystem is
restored, files that had been in migrated state will not be
recallable by DMF. Note that dumping of extended file
attributes is also optional.</p>

<p>-B Change the ownership and permissions of the
destination directory to match those of the root directory
of the dump.</p>

<p>-D Restore DMAPI (Data Management Application
Programming Interface) event settings. If the restored
filesystem will be managed within the same DMF environment
as the original dump it is essential that the -D option be
used. Otherwise it is not usually desirable to restore these
settings.</p>

<p>-E Prevents xfsrestore from overwriting newer versions
of files. The inode modification time of the on-media file
is compared to the inode modification time of corresponding
file in the dest direc- tory. The file is restored only if
the on-media version is newer than the version in the dest
directory. The inode modification time of a file can be
displayed with the ls -lc command.</p>

<p>-F Inhibit interactive operator prompts. This option
inhibits xfsre- store from prompting the operator for
verification of the selected dump as the restore target and
from prompting for any media change.</p>

<p>-I Causes the xfsdump inventory to be displayed (no
restore is per- formed). Each time xfsdump is used, an
online inventory in /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory is updated.
This is used to determine the base for incremental dumps. It
is also useful for manually identifying a dump session to be
restored (see the -L and -S options). Suboptions to filter
the inventory display are described later.</p>

<p>-J Inhibits inventory update when on-media session
inventory encoun- tered during restore. xfsrestore
opportunistically updates the online inventory when it
encounters an on-media session inventory, but only if run
with an effective user id of root and only if this option is
not given.</p>

<p>-L session_label Specifies the label of the dump session
to be restored. The source media is searched for this label.
It is any arbitrary string up to 255 characters long. The
label of the desired dump session can be copied from the
inventory display produced by the -I option.</p>

<p>-O options_file Insert the options contained in
options_file into the beginning of the command line. The
options are specified just as they would appear if typed
into the command line. In addition, newline char- acters (0
can be used as whitespace. The options are placed before all
options actually given on the command line, just after the
command name. Only one -O option can be used. Recursive use
is ignored. The destination directory cannot be specified in
options_file.</p>

<p>-Q Force completion of an interrupted restore session.
This option is required to work around one specific
pathological scenario. When restoring a dump session which
was interrupted due to an EOM condition and no online
session inventory is available, xfsrestore cannot know when
the restore of that dump session is complete. The operator
is forced to interrupt the restore session. In that case, if
the operator tries to subsequently apply a resumed dump
(using the -r option), xfsrestore refuses to do so. The
operator must tell xfsrestore to consider the base restore
complete by using this option when applying the resumed
dump.</p>

<p>-R Resume a previously interrupted restore. xfsrestore
can be inter- rupted at any time by pressing the terminal
interrupt character (see stty(1)). Use this option to resume
the restore. The -a and destination options must be the
same.</p>

<p>-S session_id Specifies the session UUID of the dump
session to be restored. The source media is searched for
this UUID. The UUID of the desired dump session can be
copied from the inventory display pro- duced by the -I
option.</p>

<p>-T Inhibits interactive dialogue timeouts. xfsrestore
prompts the operator for media changes. This dialogue
normally times out if no response is supplied. This option
prevents the timeout.</p>

<p>-X subtree Specifies a subtree to exclude. This is the
converse of the -s option. Any number of -X options are
allowed. Each subtree is specified as a pathname relative to
the restore dest. If a directory is specified, the directory
and all files beneath that directory are excluded.</p>

<p>-Y io_ring_length Specify I/O buffer ring length.
xfsrestore uses a ring of input buffers to achieve maximum
throughput when restoring from tape drives. The default ring
length is 3. However, this is only sup- ported when running
multi-threaded which has not been done for Linux yet -
making this option benign.</p>

<p>- A lone - causes the standard input to be read as the
source of the dump to be restored. Standard input can be a
pipe from another utility (such as xfsdump(8)) or a
redirected file. This option cannot be used with the -f
option. The - must follow all other options, and precede the
dest specification.</p>

<p>The dumped filesystem is restored into the dest
directory. There is no default; the dest must be
specified.</p>

<p>NOTES Cumulative Restoration A base (level 0) dump and
an ordered set of delta dumps can be sequen- tially
restored, each on top of the previous, to reproduce the
contents of the original filesystem at the time the last
delta was produced. The operator invokes xfsrestore once for
each dump. The -r option must be specified. The dest
directory must be the same for all invocations. Each
invocation leaves a directory named xfsrestorehousekeeping
in the dest directory (however, see the -a option above).
This directory con- tains the state information that must be
communicated between invoca- tions. The operator must remove
this directory after the last delta has been applied.</p>

<p>xfsrestore also generates a directory named orphanage in
the dest directory. xfsrestore removes this directory after
completing a simple restore. However, if orphanage is not
empty, it is not removed. This can happen if files present
on the dump media are not referenced by any of the restored
directories. The orphanage has an entry for each such file.
The entry name is the files original inode number, a
&quot;.&quot;, and the files generation count modulo 4096
(only the lower 12 bits of the generation count are
used).</p>

<p>xfsrestore does not remove the orphanage after
cumulative restores. Like the xfsrestorehousekeeping
directory, the operator must remove it after applying all
delta dumps.</p>

<p>Media Management A dump consists of one or more media
files contained on one or more media objects. A media file
contains all or a portion of the filesys- tem dump. Large
filesystems are broken up into multiple media files to
minimize the impact of media dropouts, and to accommodate
media object boundaries (end-of-media).</p>

<p>A media object is any storage medium: a tape cartridge,
a remote tape device (see rmt(8)), a regular file, or the
standard input (currently other removable media drives are
not supported). Tape cartridges can contain multiple media
files, which are typically separated by (in tape parlance)
file marks. If a dump spans multiple media objects, the
restore must begin with the media object containing the
first media file dumped. The operator is prompted when the
next media object is needed.</p>

<p>Media objects can contain more than one dump. The
operator can select the desired dump by specifying the dump
label (-L option), or by speci- fying the dump UUID (-S
option). If neither is specified, xfsrestore scans the
entire media object, prompting the operator as each dump
ses- sion is encountered.</p>

<p>The inventory display (-I option) is useful for
identifying the media objects required. It is also useful
for identifying a dump session. The session UUID can be
copied from the inventory display to the -S option argument
to unambiguously identify a dump session to be restored.</p>

<p>Dumps placed in regular files or the standard output do
not span multi- ple media objects, nor do they contain
multiple dumps.</p>

<p>Inventory Each dump session updates an inventory
database in /var/lib/xfs- dump/inventory. This database can
be displayed by invoking xfsrestore with the -I option. The
display uses tabbed indentation to present the inventory
hierarchically. The first level is filesystem. The second
level is session. The third level is media stream (currently
only one stream is supported). The fourth level lists the
media files sequen- tially composing the stream.</p>

<p>The following suboptions are available to filter the
display.</p>

<p>-I depth=n (where n is 1, 2, or 3) limits the
hierarchical depth of the dis- play. When n is 1, only the
filesystem information from the inven- tory is displayed.
When n is 2, only filesystem and session infor- mation are
displayed. When n is 3, only filesystem, session and stream
information are displayed.</p>

<p>-I level=n (where n is the dump level) limits the
display to dumps of that particular dump level.</p>

<p>The display may be restricted to media files contained
in a specific media object.</p>

<p>-I mobjid=value (where value is a media ID) specifies
the media object by its media ID.</p>

<p>-I mobjlabel=value (where value is a media label)
specifies the media object by its media label.</p>

<p>Similarly, the display can be restricted to a specific
filesystem.</p>

<p>-I mnt=mount_point (that is, [hostname:]pathname),
identifies the filesystem by mountpoint. Specifying the
hostname is optional, but may be use- ful in a clustered
environment where more than one host can be responsible for
dumping a filesystem.</p>

<p>-I fsid=filesystem_id identifies the filesystem by
filesystem ID.</p>

<p>-I dev=device_pathname (that is,
[hostname:]device_pathname) identifies the filesystem by
device. As with the mnt filter, specifying the hostname is
optional.</p>

<p>More than one of these suboptions, separated by commas,
may be speci- fied at the same time to limit the display of
the inventory to those dumps of interest. However, at most
four suboptions can be specified at once: one to constrain
the display hierarchy depth, one to constrain the dump
level, one to constrain the media object, and one to
constrain the filesystem.</p>

<p>For example, -I depth=1,mobjlabel=&quot;tape
1&quot;,mnt=host1:/test_mnt would display only the
filesystem information (depth=1) for those filesystems that
were mounted on host1:/test_mnt at the time of the dump, and
only those filesystems dumped to the media object labeled
&quot;tape 1&quot;.</p>

<p>Dump records may be removed (pruned) from the inventory
using the xfs- invutil program.</p>

<p>An additional media file is placed at the end of each
dump stream. This media file contains the inventory
information for the current dump session. If the online
inventory files in /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory are missing
information for the current dump session, then the inven-
tory information in the media file is automatically added to
the files in /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory. If you wish to
incorporate the inven- tory information from the media file
without restoring any data, you may do so using the -t
option:</p>

<p># xfsrestore -t -f /dev/tape</p>

<p>This is useful to rebuild the inventory database if it
is ever lost or corrupted. The only caveat is that
xfsrestore needs to read through the entire dump in order to
reach the inventory media file. This could become time
consuming for dump sessions with large media files.</p>

<p>Media Errors xfsdump is tolerant of media errors, but
cannot do error correction. If a media error occurs in the
body of a media file, the filesystem file represented at
that point is lost. The bad portion of the media is skipped,
and the restoration resumes at the next filesystem file
after the bad portion of the media.</p>

<p>If a media error occurs in the beginning of the media
file, the entire media file is lost. For this reason, large
dumps are broken into a number of reasonably sized media
files. The restore resumes with the next media file.</p>

<p>Quotas When xfsdump dumps a filesystem with user quotas,
it creates a file in the root of the dump called
xfsdump_quotas. xfsrestore can restore this file like any
other file included in the dump. This file can be processed
by the restore command of xfs_quota(8) to reactivate the
quo- tas. However, the xfsdump_quotas file contains
information which may first require modification;
specifically the filesystem name and the user ids. If you
are restoring the quotas for the same users on the same
filesystem from which the dump was taken, then no
modification will be necessary. However, if you are
restoring the dump to a differ- ent filesystem, you will
need to:</p>

<p>- ensure the new filesystem is mounted with the quota
option</p>

<p>- modify the xfsdump_quotas file to contain the new
filesystem name</p>

<p>- ensure the uids in the xfsdump_quotas file are
correct</p>

<p>Once the quota information has been verified, the
restore command of xfs_quota (8) can be used to apply the
quota limits to the filesystem.</p>

<p>Group and project quotas are handled in a similar
fashion and will be restored in files called
xfsdump_quotas_group and xfsdump_quotas_proj,
respectively.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To restore the root filesystem from a locally
mounted tape:</p>

<p># xfsrestore -f /dev/tape /</p>

<p>To restore from a remote tape, specifying the dump
session id:</p>

<p># xfsrestore -L session_1 -f otherhost:/dev/tape
/new</p>

<p>To restore the contents a of a dump to another
subdirectory:</p>

<p># xfsrestore -f /dev/tape /newdir</p>

<p>To copy the contents of a filesystem to another
directory (see xfs- dump(8)):</p>

<p># xfsdump -J - / | xfsrestore -J - /new</p>

<p>FILES /var/lib/xfsdump/inventory dump inventory
database</p>

<p>SEE ALSO rmt(8), xfsdump(8), xfsinvutil(8),
xfs_quota(8), attr_set(2).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The exit code is 0 on normal completion, and
non-zero if an error occurred or the restore was terminated
by the operator.</p>

<p>For all verbosity levels greater than 0 (silent) the
final line of the output shows the exit status of the
restore. It is of the form:</p>

<p>xfsdump: Restore Status: code</p>

<p>Where code takes one of the following values: SUCCESS
(normal comple- tion), INTERRUPT (interrupted), QUIT (media
no longer usable), INCOM- PLETE (restore incomplete), FAULT
(software error), and ERROR (resource error). Every attempt
will be made to keep both the syntax and the semantics of
this log message unchanged in future versions of xfsre-
store. However, it may be necessary to refine or expand the
set of exit codes, or their interpretation at some point in
the future.</p>

<p>BUGS Pathnames of restored non-directory files (relative
to the dest direc- tory) must be 1023 characters
(MAXPATHLEN) or less. Longer pathnames are discarded and a
warning message displayed.</p>

<p>There is no verify option to xfsrestore. This would
allow the operator to compare a filesystem dump to an
existing filesystem, without actu- ally doing a restore.</p>

<p>The interactive commands (-i option) do not understand
regular expres- sions.</p>

<p>When the minimal rmt option is specified, xfsrestore
applies it to all remote tape sources. The same blocksize
(specified by the -b option) is used for all these remote
drives.</p>

<p>xfsrestore uses the alert program only when a media
change is required.</p>

<p>Cumulative mode (-r option) requires that the operator
invoke xfsre- store for the base and for each delta to be
applied in sequence to the base. It would be better to allow
the operator to identify the last delta in the sequence of
interest, and let xfsrestore work backwards from that delta
to identify and apply the preceding deltas and base dump,
all in one invocation.</p>
