<p>NAME perlutil - utilities packaged with the Perl
distribution</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Along with the Perl interpreter itself, the
Perl distribution installs a range of utilities on your
system. There are also several utilities which are used by
the Perl distribution itself as part of the install process.
This document exists to list all of these utilities, explain
what they are for and provide pointers to each module s
documentation, if appropriate.</p>

<p>LIST OF UTILITIES Documentation perldoc The main
interface to Perls documentation is &quot;perldoc&quot;,
although if youre reading this, its more than likely that
you ve already found it. perldoc will extract and format the
documentation from any file in the current directory, any
Perl module installed on the system, or any of the standard
documentation pages, such as this one. Use &quot;perldoc
&lt;name&gt;&quot; to get information on any of the
utilities described in this document.</p>

<p>pod2man and pod2text If it s run from a terminal,
perldoc will usually call pod2man to translate POD (Plain
Old Documentation - see perlpod for an explanation) into a
manpage, and then run man to display it; if man isnt
available, pod2text will be used instead and the output
piped through your favourite pager.</p>

<p>pod2html and pod2latex As well as these two, there are
two other converters: pod2html will produce HTML pages from
POD, and pod2latex, which produces LaTeX files.</p>

<p>pod2usage If you just want to know how to use the
utilities described here, pod2usage will just extract the
&quot;USAGE&quot; section; some of the utilities will
automatically call pod2usage on themselves when you call
them with &quot;-help&quot;.</p>

<p>podselect pod2usage is a special case of podselect, a
utility to extract named sections from documents written in
POD. For instance, while utilities have &quot;USAGE&quot;
sections, Perl modules usually have &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;
sections: &quot;podselect -s &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; ...&quot;
will extract this section for a given file.</p>

<p>podchecker If youre writing your own documentation in
POD, the podchecker utility will look for errors in your
markup.</p>

<p>splain splain is an interface to perldiag - paste in
your error message to it, and itll explain it for you.</p>

<p>roffitall The &quot;roffitall&quot; utility is not
installed on your system but lives in the pod/ directory of
your Perl source kit; it converts all the documentation from
the distribution to *roff format, and produces a typeset
PostScript or text file of the whole lot.</p>

<p>Convertors To help you convert legacy programs to Perl,
weve included three conversion filters:</p>

<p>a2p a2p converts awk scripts to Perl programs; for
example, &quot;a2p -F:&quot; on the simple awk script
&quot;{print $2}&quot; will produce a Perl program based
around this code:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { ($Fld1,$Fld2) = split(/[:0/, $_,
9999); print $Fld2; }</p>

<p>s2p and psed Similarly, s2p converts sed scripts to Perl
programs. s2p run on &quot;s/foo/bar&quot; will produce a
Perl program based around this:</p>

<p>while (&lt;&gt;) { chomp; s/foo/bar/g; print if
$printit; }</p>

<p>When invoked as psed, it behaves as a sed
implementation, written in Perl.</p>

<p>find2perl Finally, find2perl translates &quot;find&quot;
commands to Perl equivalents which use the File::Find
module. As an example, &quot;find2perl . -user root -perm
4000 -print&quot; produces the following callback subroutine
for &quot;File::Find&quot;:</p>

<p>sub wanted { my ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid);
(($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid) = lstat($_)) &amp;&amp;
$uid == $uid{&rsquo;root&rsquo;}) &amp;&amp; (($mode &amp;
0777) == 04000); print(&quot;$name0); }</p>

<p>As well as these filters for converting other languages,
the pl2pm utility will help you convert old-style Perl 4
libraries to new-style Perl5 modules.</p>

<p>Administration config_data Query or change configuration
of Perl modules that use Module::Build-based configuration
files for features and config data.</p>

<p>libnetcfg To display and change the libnet configuration
run the libnetcfg command.</p>

<p>perlivp The perlivp program is set up at Perl source
code build time to test the Perl version it was built under.
It can be used after running &quot;make install&quot; (or
your platforms equivalent procedure) to verify that perl and
its libraries have been installed correctly.</p>

<p>Development There are a set of utilities which help you
in developing Perl programs, and in particular, extending
Perl with C.</p>

<p>perlbug perlbug is the recommended way to report bugs in
the perl interpreter itself or any of the standard library
modules back to the developers; please read through the
documentation for perlbug thoroughly before using it to
submit a bug report.</p>

<p>perlthanks This program provides an easy way to send a
thank-you message back to the authors and maintainers of
perl. It s just perlbug installed under another name.</p>

<p>h2ph Back before Perl had the XS system for connecting
with C libraries, programmers used to get library constants
by reading through the C header files. You may still see
&quot;require &rsquo;syscall.ph&rsquo;&quot; or similar
around - the .ph file should be created by running h2ph on
the corresponding .h file. See the h2ph documentation for
more on how to convert a whole bunch of header files at
once.</p>

<p>c2ph and pstruct c2ph and pstruct, which are actually
the same program but behave differently depending on how
they are called, provide another way of getting at C with
Perl - theyll convert C structures and union declarations to
Perl code. This is deprecated in favour of h2xs these
days.</p>

<p>h2xs h2xs converts C header files into XS modules, and
will try and write as much glue between C libraries and Perl
modules as it can. Its also very useful for creating
skeletons of pure Perl modules.</p>

<p>enc2xs enc2xs builds a Perl extension for use by Encode
from either Unicode Character Mapping files (.ucm) or Tcl
Encoding Files (.enc). Besides being used internally during
the build process of the Encode module, you can use enc2xs
to add your own encoding to perl. No knowledge of XS is
necessary.</p>

<p>xsubpp xsubpp is a compiler to convert Perl XS code into
C code. It is typically run by the makefiles created by
ExtUtils::MakeMaker.</p>

<p>xsubpp will compile XS code into C code by embedding the
constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl
values and creates the glue necessary to let Perl access
those functions.</p>

<p>dprofpp Perl comes with a profiler, the Devel::DProf
module. The dprofpp utility analyzes the output of this
profiler and tells you which subroutines are taking up the
most run time. See Devel::DProf for more information.</p>

<p>prove prove is a command-line interface to the
test-running functionality of of Test::Harness. It s an
alternative to &quot;make test&quot;.</p>

<p>corelist A command-line front-end to
&quot;Module::CoreList&quot;, to query what modules were
shipped with given versions of perl.</p>

<p>General tools A few general-purpose tools are shipped
with perl, mostly because they came along modules included
in the perl distribution.</p>

<p>piconv piconv is a Perl version of iconv, a character
encoding converter widely available for various Unixen
today. This script was primarily a technology demonstrator
for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the place of iconv
for virtually any case.</p>

<p>ptar ptar is a tar-like program, written in pure
Perl.</p>

<p>ptardiff ptardiff is a small utility that produces a
diff between an extracted archive and an unextracted one.
(Note that this utility requires the &quot;Text::Diff&quot;
module to function properly; this module isnt distributed
with perl, but is available from the CPAN.)</p>

<p>shasum This utility, that comes with the
&quot;Digest::SHA&quot; module, is used to print or verify
SHA checksums.</p>

<p>Installation These utilities help manage extra Perl
modules that don t come with the perl distribution.</p>

<p>cpan cpan is a command-line interface to CPAN.pm. It
allows you to install modules or distributions from CPAN, or
just get information about them, and a lot more. It is
similar to the command line mode of the CPAN module,</p>

<p>perl -MCPAN -e shell</p>

<p>cpanp cpanp is, like cpan, a command-line interface to
the CPAN, using the &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; module as a
back-end. It can be used interactively or imperatively.</p>

<p>cpan2dist cpan2dist is a tool to create distributions
(or packages) from CPAN modules, then suitable for your
package manager of choice. Support for specific formats are
available from CPAN as &quot;CPANPLUS::Dist::*&quot;
modules.</p>

<p>instmodsh A little interface to ExtUtils::Installed to
examine installed modules, validate your packlists and even
create a tarball from an installed module.</p>
