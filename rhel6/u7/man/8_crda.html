<p>CRDA(8) Linux CRDA(8)</p>

<p>NAME crda - send to the kernel a wireless regulatory
domain for a given ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS crda</p>

<p>Description crda is the Linux wireless central
regulatory domain agent. crda is intended to be used by udev
scripts and should not be run manually unless debugging udev
scripts. crda is triggered to run by the kernel by sending a
udev event upon a new regulatory domain change. Regulatory
domain changes are triggered by the wireless kernel
subsystem (upon initialization and on reception of country
IEs), wireless drivers, or userspace (see iw ). Upon a
regulatory domain change the kernel sends a udev change
event for the regulatory platform. The kernel ignores regu-
latory domains sent to it if it does not expect them. The
regulatory domain is read by crda from the regulatory.bin
file.</p>

<p>RSA Digital Signature If built with openssl or gcrypt
support crda will have embedded into it an RSA digital
signature which will prevent it from reading corrupted or
non-authored regulatory.bin files. Authorship is respected
by the RSA public key packed into crda. This specific crda
package has been built with an RSA public key from John
Linville (the Linux wireless kernel maintainer) and as such
will only read regulatory.bin files signed by him. For
further information see the regulatory.bin man page.</p>

<p>UDEV RULE A udev regulatory rule must be put in place in
order to receive and parse udev events from the kernel in
order to get udev to call crda with the passed ISO / IEC
3166 alpha2 country code. An example udev rule which can be
used (usually in /lib/udev/rules.d/85-regula- tory.rules
):</p>

<p>KERNEL==&quot;regulatory*&quot;,
ACTION==&quot;change&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;platform&quot;,
RUN+=&quot;/sbin/crda&quot;</p>

<p>Environment variable Set the COUNTRY environment
variable with a specific ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2 country code
and then run crda without arguments. This will send a
regulatory domain for that alpha2 to the kernel.</p>
