<p>IPSEC_PF_KEY(8) [FIXME: manual] IPSEC_PF_KEY(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_pf_key - shows pfkey messages emitted by the
kernel when using the KLIPS or MAST stack.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pf_key --ah --esp --ipip --ipcomp --daemon
filehmac-md5-96 | hmac-sha1-96</p>

<p>STACK Note that pf_key is only supported on the KLIPS
and MAST stacks. It is not supported on any other stack.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pf_key is a program to open a PF_KEY socket
and print all messages that are received from it. With no
options, it will register itself to receive key requests for
AH, ESP, IPIP and IPCOMP security associations. If given
more specific options, then it will listen only to those
protocols which are listed.</p>

<p>If the messages are recognized, the messages will be
decoded.</p>

<p>If the option --daemon is provided, then after doing the
registrations, the program will fork into the background.
The provided file will be opened and the process ID of the
background process will be written to it. This option is
present to present race conditions in regression
testing.</p>

<p>FILES /proc/net/pf_key</p>
