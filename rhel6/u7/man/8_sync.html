<p>SYNC(8) Linux Programmer s Manual SYNC(8)</p>

<p>NAME sync - synchronize data on disk with memory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sync [--help] [--version]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sync writes any data buffered in memory out
to disk. This can include (but is not limited to) modified
superblocks, modified inodes, and delayed reads and writes.
This must be implemented by the kernel; The sync program
does nothing but exercise the sync(2) system call.</p>

<p>The kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing
(relatively slow) disk reads and writes. This improves
performance, but if the computer crashes, data may be lost
or the file system corrupted as a result. sync ensures that
everything in memory is written to disk.</p>

<p>sync should be called before the processor is halted in
an unusual man- ner (e.g., before causing a kernel panic
when debugging new kernel code). In general, the processor
should be halted using the shut- down(8) or reboot(8) or
halt(8) commands, which will attempt to put the system in a
quiescent state before calling sync(2). (Various implemen-
tations of these commands exist; consult your documentation;
on some systems one should not call reboot(8) and halt(8)
directly.)</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Print a usage message on standard output
and exit successfully.</p>

<p>--version Print version information on standard output,
then exit success- fully.</p>

<p>-- Terminate option list.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The variables LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and
LC_MESSAGES have the usual meaning.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.2.</p>

<p>NOTES On Linux, sync is only guaranteed to schedule the
dirty blocks for writing; it can actually take a short time
before all the blocks are finally written. The reboot(8) and
halt(8) commands take this into account by sleeping for a
few seconds after calling sync(2).</p>

<p>This page describes sync as found in the fileutils-4.0
package; other versions may differ slightly.</p>
