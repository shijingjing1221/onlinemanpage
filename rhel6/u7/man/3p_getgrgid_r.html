<p>GETGRGID(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETGRGID(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME getgrgid, getgrgid_r - get group database entry for
a group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;grp.h&gt;</p>

<p>struct group *getgrgid(gid_t gid);</p>

<p>int getgrgid_r(gid_t gid, struct group *grp, char
*buffer, size_t bufsize, struct group **result);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The getgrgid() function shall search the
group database for an entry with a matching gid.</p>

<p>The getgrgid() function need not be reentrant. A
function that is not required to be reentrant is not
required to be thread-safe.</p>

<p>The getgrgid_r() function shall update the group
structure pointed to by grp and store a pointer to that
structure at the location pointed to by result. The
structure shall contain an entry from the group database
with a matching gid. Storage referenced by the group
structure is allo- cated from the memory provided with the
buffer parameter, which is buf- size bytes in size. The
maximum size needed for this buffer can be determined with
the {_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX} sysconf() parameter. A NULL
pointer shall be returned at the location pointed to by
result on error or if the requested entry is not found.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, getgrgid()
shall return a pointer to a struct group with the structure
defined in &lt;grp.h&gt; with a matching entry if one is
found. The getgrgid() function shall return a null pointer
if either the requested entry was not found, or an error
occurred. On error, errno shall be set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>The return value may point to a static area which is
overwritten by a subsequent call to getgrent(), getgrgid(),
or getgrnam().</p>

<p>If successful, the getgrgid_r() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The getgrgid() and getgrgid_r() functions may
fail if:</p>

<p>EIO An I/O error has occurred.</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during getgrgid().</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>The getgrgid_r() function may fail if:</p>

<p>ERANGE Insufficient storage was supplied via buffer and
bufsize to con- tain the data to be referenced by the
resulting group structure.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Finding an Entry in the Group Database The
following example uses getgrgid() to search the group
database for a group ID that was previously stored in a stat
structure, then prints out the group name if it is found. If
the group is not found, the pro- gram prints the numeric
value of the group for the entry.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;grp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... struct stat statbuf; struct
group *grp; ... if ((grp = getgrgid(statbuf.st_gid)) !=
NULL) printf(&quot; %-8.8s&quot;, grp-&gt;gr_name); else
printf(&quot; %-8d&quot;, statbuf.st_gid); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Applications wishing to check for
error situations should set errno to 0 before calling
getgrgid(). If errno is set on return, an error
occurred.</p>

<p>The getgrgid_r() function is thread-safe and shall
return values in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly
using a static data area that may be overwritten by each
call.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
