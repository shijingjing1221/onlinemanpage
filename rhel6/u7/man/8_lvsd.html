<p>LVS(8) LVS(8)</p>

<p>NAME lvsd - daemon to control the Red Hat clustering
services.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lvsd [-c cfgfile|--configfile=cfgfile]
[-n|--nodaemon] [--nofork] [-t|--test-start] [-?|--help]
[--usage] [--version]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lvsd reads in the cluster configuration file
lvs.cf, calls ipvsadm to maintain the IPVS routing table,
and nanny to perform monitoring ser- vices.</p>

<p>lvsd is normally started by pulse although it can be run
as a command line tool. Similarly, the configuration file
that tells lvsd what to do is normally edited by piranha,
but it can be manually edited.</p>

<p>All activity from lvsd is logged to syslog (when lvsd is
running as a daemon).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c cfgfile|--configfile=cfgfile Normally, lvsd
uses lvs.cf as its configuration file, but this can be
overridden and another file can be used.</p>

<p>-n|--nodaemon Normally, lvsd runs as a daemon, however
using this option, lvsd runs in the foreground. When running
in this mode, all its out- put is sent to STDOUT instead of
syslog.</p>

<p>--nofork Dont fork, but do perform disassociate.</p>

<p>-t|--test-start Running lvsd is test mode allows the
user to monitor what lvsd would actually do. This is only
useful during debugging.</p>

<p>-?|--help Shows a verbose usage listing.</p>

<p>--usage Outputs a terse argument summary.</p>

<p>--version Displays program version.</p>
