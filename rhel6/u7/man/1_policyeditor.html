<p>NAME policyeditor - view and modify security policy
settings for javaws and the browser plugin</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS policyeditor policyeditor [-file] policy_file
[-codebase] url</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION policyeditor is a GUI application with small
command line support to view and edit applet security policy
settings used by the icedtea-web implementation of javaws
and the browser plugin. It is intended as a simpler, easier
to use, and more accessible alternative to the standard JDK
Policy Tool. Administrators and power users who need fine
grained control over policy files should probably use Policy
Tool instead of PolicyEditor.</p>

<p>If executed without any arguments, no file is opened,
and saving the file will result in a prompt on where to save
it. Otherwise, if a file path is given as a command line
argument, then that file path will be opened and parsed as a
policy file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -help Prints a short help text and exits.</p>

<p>-file policy_file Specifies a policy file path to open.
If exactly one argument is given, and it is not this flag,
it is interpreted as a file path to open, as if this flag
was given first. This flag exists mostly for compatibility
with Policy Tool, but is also needed when opening a policy
file and also using the -codebase flag.</p>

<p>-codebase url Specifies an applet codebase URL. If the
specified codebase already exists in the policy file (if
any), then it will be selected when the editor opens. If it
is a new codebase then it will be added and selected.
Multiple URLs may also be given with a single -codebase flag
by separating them with spaces. In this case, the last
codebase given will be selected, and all will be added. If
this flag is given more than once, only the first is
used.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES policyeditor Show the GUI editor</p>

$HOME/.config/icedtea-web/security/java.policy Opens the
