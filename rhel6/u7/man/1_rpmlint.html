<p>NAME rpmlint - check common problems in rpm packages</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rpmlint [OPTION]... [FILE|PACKAGE]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rpmlint is a tool for checking common errors
in rpm packages. It can be used to test individual packages
and spec files before uploading or to check an entire
distribution. By default all applicable checks are processed
but specific checks can be performed by using command line
parameters.</p>

<p>FILE can be a rpm package file, a spec file, or a
directory. In case of a directory, it is recursively
searched for rpm and spec files to check. The special value
- results in standard input being read and treated as
(single) spec file content. PACKAGE is the name of an
installed package or a glob(7) pattern to match installed
packages, unless a file by that name exists.</p>

<p>-i, --info Display explanations for reported
messages.</p>

<p>-I messageid[,messageid...] Display explanations for the
specified message identifiers and exit. Multiple identifiers
can be specified by separating them with commas.</p>

<p>-c, --check=check Run only the specified check. This
option may be given multiple times to specify multiple
checks to run.</p>

<p>-a, --all Check all installed packages.</p>

<p>-C, --checkdir=dir Insert dir to the front of the list
of paths to load checks (and other Python modules) from.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display summary of command line options and
exit.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Operate in verbose mode.</p>

<p>-E, --extractdir=dir Base directory for extracted
temporary files, default is what Pythons
tempfile.gettempdir() returns.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display version information and exit.</p>

<p>-n, --noexception Ignore output filters.</p>

<p>-f, --file=conffile Load user configuration from the
specified file, default is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpmlint
(~/.config/rpmlint if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is empty or not
set).</p>

<p>-o, --option=value Override a configuration option.
value is a whitespace sepa- rated string, first word of
which is the option name to set, and the Python eval()
return value for the rest is set as the value for the
option. Passing only an option name is treated as if None
was passed as its value. See the file &quot;config&quot;
shipped with rpmlint for the list of configuration options
and their types. For example: -o &quot;NetworkEnabled
True&quot; -o &quot;Distribution My favorite distro&quot; -o
&quot;MaxLineLength 80&quot; -o &quot;ValidShells (/bin/sh,
/bin/bash)&quot;</p>

<p>CAVEATS All checks do not apply to all argument types.
For best check cover- age, run rpmlint on all source and
binary packages your build produces. The set of checks
rpmlint runs on source packages is a superset of the one for
plain specfiles, the set of checks run for installed binary
packages is a superset of the one for uninstalled binary
package files, and the source and binary package check sets
are quite different.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/rpmlint/config Built-in
configuration.</p>

<p>/etc/rpmlint/*config System wide configuration.</p>

<p>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpmlint or ~/.config/rpmlint User
configuration.</p>

<p>EXIT CODES 0 No errors.</p>

<p>1 Unspecified error.</p>

<p>2 Interrupted.</p>

<p>64 One or more error message printed.</p>

<p>66 Badness threshold exceeded.</p>
