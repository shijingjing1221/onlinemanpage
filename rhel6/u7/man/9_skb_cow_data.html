<p>NAME skb_cow_data - Check that a socket buffer&acute;s
data buffers are writable</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int skb_cow_data(struct sk_buff * skb, int
tailbits, struct sk_buff ** trailer);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS skb The socket buffer to check.</p>

<p>tailbits Amount of trailing space to be added</p>

<p>trailer Returned pointer to the skb where the tailbits
space begins</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Make sure that the data buffers attached to
a socket buffer are writable. If they are not, private
copies are made of the data buffers and the socket buffer is
set to use these instead.</p>

<p>If tailbits is given, make sure that there is space to
write tailbits bytes of data beyond current end of socket
buffer. trailer will be set to point to the skb in which
this space begins.</p>
