<p>PTHREAD_RWLOCK_UNLOCK(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
PTHREAD_RWLOCK_UNLOCK(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pthread_rwlock_unlock - unlock a read-write lock
object</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pthread_rwlock_unlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pthread_rwlock_unlock() function shall
release a lock held on the read-write lock object referenced
by rwlock. Results are undefined if the read-write lock
rwlock is not held by the calling thread.</p>

<p>If this function is called to release a read lock from
the read-write lock object and there are other read locks
currently held on this read- write lock object, the
read-write lock object remains in the read locked state. If
this function releases the last read lock for this
read-write lock object, the read-write lock object shall be
put in the unlocked state with no owners.</p>

<p>If this function is called to release a write lock for
this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object
shall be put in the unlocked state.</p>

<p>If there are threads blocked on the lock when it becomes
available, the scheduling policy shall determine which
thread(s) shall acquire the lock. If the Thread Execution
Scheduling option is supported, when threads executing with
the scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or
SCHED_SPORADIC are waiting on the lock, they shall acquire
the lock in priority order when the lock becomes available.
For equal priority threads, write locks shall take
precedence over read locks. If the Thread Execution
Scheduling option is not supported, it is implementa-
tion-defined whether write locks take precedence over read
locks.</p>

<p>Results are undefined if any of these functions are
called with an uninitialized read-write lock.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the pthread_rwlock_unlock()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pthread_rwlock_unlock() function may fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value specified by rwlock does not refer to
an initialized read-write lock object.</p>

<p>EPERM The current thread does not hold a lock on the
read-write lock.</p>

<p>The pthread_rwlock_unlock() function shall not return an
error code of [EINTR].</p>
