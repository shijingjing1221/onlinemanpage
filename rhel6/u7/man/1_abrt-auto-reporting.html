<p>ABRT-AUTO-REPORTIN(1) ABRT Manual
ABRT-AUTO-REPORTIN(1)</p>

<p>NAME abrt-auto-reporting - Get or modify the auto
reporting option values</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS abrt-auto-reporting [-v] [ enabled | yes | 1 |
on | disabled | no | 0 | off ] [ [--anonymous] | [--username
USERNAME [--password PASSWORD] ] | [--certificate SOURCE]
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Reads the configuration from abrt.conf and
saves the changes to the same file.</p>

<p>The changes will take effect immediately without
necessity to restart any ABRT process and will be
persistent.</p>

<p>disabled User have to report the detect problems
manually</p>

<p>enabled ABRT uploads an uReport which was generated for
a detected problem immediately after the detection
phase.</p>

<p>Reads and saves the authentication configuration options
in /etc/libreport/plugins/ureport.conf and
/etc/libreport/plugins/rhtsupport.conf</p>

<p>uReport description ABRT supports uReports for four
types of crashes: crashes of C/C++ programs that result in a
core dump, uncaught Python exceptions, uncaught Java
exceptions and kernel oopses.</p>

<p>Each uReport generally contains a stack trace, or
multiple stack traces in the case of multi-threaded C/C++
and Java programs. The stack trace only describes the call
stack of the program at the time of the crash and does not
contain contents of any variables.</p>

<p>Every uReport also contains identification of the
operating system, versions of the RPM packages involved in
the crash, and whether the program ran under a root
user.</p>

<p>There are also items specific to each crash type:</p>

<p>C/C++ crashes these are path to the executable and
signal delivered to the program,</p>

<p>Python exceptions there is the type of the exception
(without the error message, which may contain sensitive
data),</p>

<p>for kernel oopses these are list of loaded kernel
modules, list of taint flags, and full text of the kernel
oops.</p>

<p>The authenticated uReports also contains hostname and
machineid to enable a server side filtering at
https://access.redhat.com/.</p>

<p>The authenticated uReports have the benefit of rich
server replies which may include a solution for the
submitted crash. The authentication is done using either Red
Hat Subscription Certificates or Red Hat Customer Portal
credentials.</p>

<p>Warning: The full text of a kernel oops might contain
information like the identification of the host hardware
type. You should disable the autoreporting feature if you do
not want to share this information with Red Hat.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -v, --verbose Be more verbose. Can be given
multiple times.</p>

<p>-a, --anonymous Turns the authentication off by clearing
both SSLClientAuth and HTTPAuth configuration options in
/etc/libreport/plugins/ureport.conf</p>

<p>-u, --username USERNAME Turns HTTP Authentication on by
setting HTTPAuth configuration option to rhts-credentials in
/etc/libreport/plugins/ureport.conf and storing USERNAME and
PASSWORD in /etc/libreport/plugins/rhtsupport.conf Also
turns the SSL Client Authentication off, because these
methods cannot be used together.</p>

<p>-p, --password PASSWORD Password for HTTP
Authentication. If not provided, a prompt asking for it will
be issued.</p>

<p>-c, --certificate SOURCE Turns SSL Client Authentication
on by setting SSLClientAuth configuration option to SOURCE
in /etc/libreport/plugins/ureport.conf. Also turns the HTTP
Authentication off, because these methods cannot be used
together.</p>
