<p>NAME vncviewer - VNC viewer for X</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vncviewer [options] [host][:display#] vncviewer
[options] [host][::port] vncviewer [options] -listen
[port]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION vncviewer is a viewer (client) for Virtual
Network Computing. This manual page documents version 4 for
the X window system.</p>

<p>If you run the viewer with no arguments it will prompt
you for a VNC server to connect to. Alternatively, specify
the VNC server as an argument, e.g.:</p>

<p>vncviewer snoopy:2</p>

<p>where snoopy is the name of the machine, and 2 is the
display num- ber of the VNC server on that machine. Either
the machine name or dis- play number can be omitted. So for
example &quot;:1&quot; means display number 1 on the same
machine, and &quot;snoopy&quot; means &quot;snoopy:0&quot;
i.e. display 0 on machine &quot;snoopy&quot;.</p>

<p>If the VNC server is successfully contacted, you will be
prompted for a password to authenticate you. If the password
is correct, a window will appear showing the desktop of the
VNC server.</p>

<p>AUTOMATIC PROTOCOL SELECTION The viewer tests the speed
of the connection to the server and chooses the encoding and
pixel format (color level) appropriately. This makes it much
easier to use than previous versions where the user had to
specify arcane command line arguments.</p>

<p>The viewer normally starts out assuming the link is
slow, using the encoding with the best compression. If it
turns out that the link is fast enough it switches to an
encoding which compresses less but is faster to generate,
thus improving the interactive feel.</p>

<p>The viewer normally starts in full-color mode, but
switches to low- color mode if the bandwidth is
insufficient. However, this only occurs when communicating
with servers supporting protocol 3.8 or newer, since many
old servers does not support color mode changes safely.</p>

<p>Automatic selection can be turned off by setting the
AutoSelect parame- ter to false, or from the options
dialog.</p>

<p>POPUP MENU The viewer has a popup menu containing
entries which perform various actions. It is usually brought
up by pressing F8, but this can be con- figured with the
MenuKey parameter. Actions which the popup menu can perform
include:</p>

<p>* switching in and out of full-screen mode</p>

<p>* quitting the viewer</p>

<p>* generating key events, e.g. sending ctrl-alt-del</p>

<p>* accessing the options dialog and various other
dialogs</p>

<p>By default, key presses in the popup menu get sent to
the VNC server and dismiss the popup. So to get an F8
through to the VNC server sim- ply press it twice.</p>

<p>FULL SCREEN MODE A full-screen mode is supported. This
is particularly useful when con- necting to a remote screen
which is the same size as your local one. If the remote
screen is bigger, you can scroll by bumping the mouse
against the edge of the screen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this mode doesnt work completely with all
window man- agers, since it breaks the X window management
conventions.</p>

<p>OPTIONS (PARAMETERS) You can get a list of parameters by
giving -h as a command-line option to vncviewer. Parameters
can be turned on with -param or off with -param=0.
Parameters which take a value can be specified as -param
value. Other valid forms are param=value -param=value
--param=value. Parameter names are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>Many of the parameters can also be set graphically via
the options dia- log box. This can be accessed from the
popup menu or from the &quot;Connec- tion details&quot;
dialog box.</p>

<p>-display Xdisplay Specifies the X display on which the
VNC viewer window should appear.</p>

<p>-geometry geometry Standard X position and sizing
specification.</p>

<p>-listen [port] Causes vncviewer to listen on the given
port (default 5500) for reverse connections from a VNC
server. WinVNC supports reverse connections initiated using
the Add New Client menu option or the -connect command-line
option. Xvnc supports reverse con- nections with a helper
program called vncconfig.</p>

<p>-passwd password-file If you are on a filesystem which
gives you access to the pass- word file used by the server,
you can specify it here to avoid typing it in. It will
usually be &quot;~/.vnc/passwd&quot;.</p>

<p>-passwdInput true, false Force standard vnc dialog to
getting password and reads password from stdin. Default is
false(shows dialog window)</p>

<p>-Shared When you make a connection to a VNC server, all
other existing connections are normally closed. This option
requests that they be left open, allowing you to share the
desktop with someone already using it.</p>

<p>-ViewOnly Specifies that no keyboard or mouse events
should be sent to the server. Useful if you want to view a
desktop without interfer- ing; often needs to be combined
with -Shared.</p>

<p>-FullScreen Start in full-screen mode.</p>

<p>-DesktopSize widthxheight Instead of keeping the
existing remote screen size, the client will attempt to
switch to the specified since when connecting. If the server
does not support the SetDesktopSize message then the screen
will retain the original size.</p>

<p>-AutoSelect Use automatic selection of encoding and
pixel format (default is on). Normally the viewer tests the
speed of the connection to the server and chooses the
encoding and pixel format appropri- ately. Turn it off with
-AutoSelect=0.</p>

<p>-FullColor, -FullColour Tells the VNC server to send
full-color pixels in the best for- mat for this display.
This is default.</p>

<p>-LowColorLevel, -LowColourLevel level Selects the
reduced color level to use on slow links. level can range
from 0 to 2, 0 meaning 8 colors, 1 meaning 64 colors (the
default), 2 meaning 256 colors. Note that decision if
reduced color level is used is made by vncviewer. If you
would like to force vncviewer to use reduced color level use
-AutoSelect=0 parameter.</p>

<p>-PreferredEncoding encoding This option specifies the
preferred encoding to use from one of &quot;Tight&quot;,
&quot;ZRLE&quot;, &quot;hextile&quot; or
&quot;raw&quot;.</p>

<p>-UseLocalCursor Render the mouse cursor locally if the
server supports it (default is on). This can make the
interactive performance feel much better over slow
links.</p>

<p>-WMDecorationWidth w, -WMDecorationHeight h The total
width and height taken up by window manager decora- tions.
This is used to calculate the maximum size of the VNC viewer
window. Default is width 6, height 24.</p>

<p>-log logname:dest:level Configures the debug log
settings. dest can currently be stderr or stdout, and level
is between 0 and 100, 100 meaning most ver- bose output.
logname is usually * meaning all, but you can tar- get a
specific source file if you know the name of its &quot;Log-
Writer&quot;. Default is *:stderr:30.</p>

<p>-MenuKey keysym-name This option specifies the key which
brings up the popup menu. The key is specified as an X11
keysym name (these can be obtained by removing the XK_
prefix from the entries in
&quot;/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h&quot;). Default is
F8.</p>

<p>-via gateway Automatically create encrypted TCP tunnel
to the gateway machine before connection, connect to the
host through that tunnel (TigerVNC-specific). By default,
this option invokes SSH local port forwarding, assuming that
SSH client binary can be accessed as /usr/bin/ssh. Note that
when using the -via option, the host machine name should be
specified as known to the gateway machine, e.g.
&quot;localhost&quot; denotes the gateway, not the machine
where vncviewer was launched. The environment variable
VNC_VIA_CMD can override the default tunnel command of
/usr/bin/ssh -f -L
&quot;$L&quot;:&quot;$H&quot;:&quot;$R&quot; &quot;$G&quot;
sleep 20. The tunnel command is executed with the
environment variables L, H, R, and G taken the values of the
local port number, the remote host, the port number on the
remote host, and the gateway machine respectively.</p>

<p>-SecurityTypes security-type Comma-separated list of
which security type(s) to use. Types include VeNCrypt,
X509Plain, TLSPlain, X509Vnc, TLSVnc, X509None, TLSNone,
VncAuth, None. The list must start with VeN- Crypt for the
X509 and TLS types. For example,
-SecurityTypes=VeNCrypt,TLSVnc</p>

<p>Description of options:</p>

<p>VeNCrypt enable X509 and TLS options</p>

<p>X509Plain X.509 encryption with Plaintext
authentication</p>

<p>TLSPlain TLS encryption with Plaintext
authentication</p>

<p>X509Vnc X.509 encryption with VNC password
authentication</p>

<p>TLSVnc TLS encryption with VNC password
authentication</p>

<p>X509None X.509 encryption with no authentication</p>

<p>TLSNone TLS encryption with no authentication</p>

<p>VNCAuth VNC password authencation (no encryption)</p>

<p>None No authentication, no encryption</p>
