<p>xcb_allow_events(3) XCB Requests xcb_allow_events(3)</p>

<p>NAME xcb_allow_events - release queued events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</p>

<p>Request function xcb_void_cookie_t
xcb_allow_events(xcb_connection_t *conn, uint8_t mode,
xcb_timestamp_t time);</p>

<p>REQUEST ARGUMENTS conn The XCB connection to X11.</p>

<p>mode One of the following values:</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_ASYNC_POINTER For AsyncPointer, if the pointer
is frozen by the client, pointer event processing continues
normal- ly. If the pointer is frozen twice by the client on
behalf of two separate grabs, AsyncPointer thaws for both.
AsyncPointer has no effect if the pointer is not frozen by
the client, but the pointer need not be grabbed by the
client.</p>

<p>TODO: rewrite this in more understandable terms.</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_SYNC_POINTER For SyncPointer, if the pointer
is frozen and ac- tively grabbed by the client, pointer
event pro- cessing continues normally until the next Button-
Press or ButtonRelease event is reported to the client, at
which time the pointer again appears to freeze. However, if
the reported event causes the pointer grab to be released,
then the pointer does not freeze. SyncPointer has no effect
if the point- er is not frozen by the client or if the
pointer is not grabbed by the client.</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_REPLAY_POINTER For ReplayPointer, if the
pointer is actively grabbed by the client and is frozen as
the result of an event having been sent to the client
(either from the activation of a GrabButton or from a pre-
vious AllowEvents with mode SyncPointer but not from a
GrabPointer), then the pointer grab is re- leased and that
event is completely reprocessed, this time ignoring any
passive grabs at or above (towards the root) the grab-window
of the grab just released. The request has no effect if the
pointer is not grabbed by the client or if the pointer is
not frozen as the result of an event.</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_ASYNC_KEYBOARD For AsyncKeyboard, if the
keyboard is frozen by the client, keyboard event processing
continues normal- ly. If the keyboard is frozen twice by the
client on behalf of two separate grabs, AsyncKeyboard thaws
for both. AsyncKeyboard has no effect if the keyboard is not
frozen by the client, but the key- board need not be grabbed
by the client.</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_SYNC_KEYBOARD For SyncKeyboard, if the
keyboard is frozen and ac- tively grabbed by the client,
keyboard event pro- cessing continues normally until the
next KeyPress or KeyRelease event is reported to the client,
at which time the keyboard again appears to freeze. However,
if the reported event causes the keyboard grab to be
released, then the keyboard does not freeze. SyncKeyboard
has no effect if the keyboard is not frozen by the client or
if the keyboard is not grabbed by the client.</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_REPLAY_KEYBOARD For ReplayKeyboard, if the
keyboard is actively grabbed by the client and is frozen as
the result of an event having been sent to the client
(either from the activation of a GrabKey or from a previous
AllowEvents with mode SyncKeyboard but not from a
GrabKeyboard), then the keyboard grab is released and that
event is completely reprocessed, this time ignoring any
passive grabs at or above (towards the root) the grab-window
of the grab just released. The request has no effect if the
keyboard is not grabbed by the client or if the keyboard is
not frozen as the result of an event.</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_ASYNC_BOTH For AsyncBoth, if the pointer and
the keyboard are frozen by the client, event processing for
both de- vices continues normally. If a device is frozen
twice by the client on behalf of two separate grabs,
AsyncBoth thaws for both. AsyncBoth has no effect unless
both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the client.</p>

<p>XCB_ALLOW_SYNC_BOTH For SyncBoth, if both pointer and
keyboard are frozen by the client, event processing (for
both devices) continues normally until the next Button-
Press, ButtonRelease, KeyPress, or KeyRelease event is
reported to the client for a grabbed device (button event
for the pointer, key event for the keyboard), at which time
the devices again appear to freeze. However, if the reported
event causes the grab to be released, then the devices do
not freeze (but if the other device is still grabbed, then a
subsequent event for it will still cause both devices to
freeze). SyncBoth has no effect un- less both pointer and
keyboard are frozen by the client. If the pointer or
keyboard is frozen twice by the client on behalf of two
separate grabs, SyncBoth thaws for both (but a subsequent
freeze for SyncBoth will only freeze each device once).</p>

<p>time Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X
over the network.</p>

<p>The special value XCB_CURRENT_TIME will be replaced with
the current server time.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Releases queued events if the client has
caused a device (pointer/key- board) to freeze due to
grabbing it actively. This request has no ef- fect if time
is earlier than the last-grab time of the most recent ac-
tive grab for this client or if time is later than the
current X server time.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Returns an xcb_void_cookie_t. Errors (if
any) have to be handled in the event loop.</p>

<p>If you want to handle errors directly with
xcb_request_check instead, use xcb_allow_events_checked. See
xcb-requests(3) for details.</p>

<p>ERRORS xcb_value_error_t You specified an invalid
mode.</p>
