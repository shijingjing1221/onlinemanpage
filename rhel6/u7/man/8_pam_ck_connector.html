<p>PAM_CK_CONNECTOR(8) ConsoleKit Manual
PAM_CK_CONNECTOR(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_ck_connector - Register session with
ConsoleKit</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_ck_connector.so [debug]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_ck_connector PAM module registers a
login session with the system-wide ConsoleKit daemon. This
PAM module should be used with caution; only local login
managers such as login(1) should use this. Since the
ConsoleKit daemon can accept both an tty and an X11 display
the normal parameters set by PAM are not always useful.</p>

<p>An application can therefore override these with the PAM
environment variables CKCON_TTY, CKCON_X11_DISPLAY and
CKCON_X11_DISPLAY_DEVICE (the application should remember to
unset these before starting the login session).</p>

<p>Also note that the ConsoleKit daemon may reject
registration attempts if the given set of data are
inconsistent with each other. More more information, see the
ConsoleKit documentation on the OpenSessionWithParameters()
method call on the org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager D-Bus
interface.</p>

<p>If registration with the ConsoleKit daemon succeeds,
this PAM module will set the environment variable
XDG_SESSION_COOKIE which is used to defined membership of a
login session.</p>

<p>This PAM module has the side effect that it creates a
connection to the system message bus that is kept open until
the session ends. This is used by the ConsoleKit daemon to
track the life-cycle of the session and, as such, should the
login manager crash, the session will be properly
unregistered.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>nox11 Do not create a session if PAM specifies an X11
display instead of a /dev/tty terminal.</p>
