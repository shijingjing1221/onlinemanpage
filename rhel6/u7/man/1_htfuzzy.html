<p>NAME htfuzzy - fuzzy command-line search utility for the
ht://Dig search engine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS htfuzzy [-c configfile] [-v] algorithm
[options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Description to follow here</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c configfile Use the specified configfile
instead of the default.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode , -vvv etc ). Specifying more than two v
s is probably only useful for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>Supported Algorithms Different algoritms are supported
for searching: soundex Creates a slightly modified soundex
key database. Dif- ferences with the standard soundex
algorithm are: Keys are 6 digits and the first letter is
also encoded. metaphone Creates a metaphone key database.
This algorithm is more spe- cific to English, but will get
fewer &quot;weird&quot; matches than the soundex
algorithm.</p>

<p>accents (No description of the algorithm at the
moment)</p>

<p>endings Creates two databases which can be used to match
common word endings. The creation of these databases
requires a list of affix rules and a dictionary which uses
those affix rules. The format of the affix rules and
dictionary files are the ones used by the ispell program.
Included with the distribu- tion are the affix rules for
English and a fairly small English dictionary. Other
languages can be supported by getting the appropriate affix
rules and dictionaries. These are available for many
languages; check the ispell distribu- tion for more
details.</p>

<p>synonyms Creates a database of synonyms for words. It
reads a text database of synonyms and creates a database
that htsearch can then use. Each line of the text database
consists of words where the first word will have the other
words on that line as synonyms.</p>

<p>Notes on searching Please consult specialised literature
to find out how the different algorithms work or simply try
another search stragegy you do not get the intended search
results.</p>
