<p>XtFindFile(3) XT FUNCTIONS XtFindFile(3)</p>

<p>NAME XtFindFile - search for a file using substitutions
in the path list</p>

<p>SYNTAX String XtFindFile(String path, Substitution
substitutions, Cardinal num_substitutions, XtFilePredicate
predicate);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS path Specifies a path of file names, including
substitution char- acters.</p>

<p>substitutions Specifies a list of substitutions to make
into a path.</p>

<p>num_substitutions Specifies the number of substitutions
passed in.</p>

<p>predicate Specifies a procedure to call to judge a
potential file name, or NULL.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The path parameter specifies a string that
consists of a series of potential file names delimited by
colons. Within each name, the per- cent character specifies
a string substitution selected by the follow- ing character.
The character sequence %: specifies an embedded colon that
is not a delimiter; the sequence is replaced by a single
colon. The character sequence %% specifies a percent
character that does not introduce a substitution; the
sequence is replaced by a single percent character. If a
percent character is followed by any other character,
XtFindFile looks through the specified substitutions for
that character in the match field and if found replaces the
percent and match characters with the string in the
corresponding substitution field. A substitution field entry
of NULL is equivalent to a pointer to an empty string. If
the operating system does not interpret multi- ple embedded
name separators in the path (i.e., / in POSIX) the same way
as a single separator, XtFindFile will collapse multiple
sepa- rators into a single one after performing all string
substitutions. Except for collapsing embedded separators,
the contents of the string substitutions are not interpreted
by XtFindFile and may therefore con- tain any
operating-system-dependent characters, including additional
name separators. Each resulting string is passed to the
predicate pro- cedure until a string is found for which the
procedure returns True; this string is the return value for
XtFindFile. If no string yields a True return from the
predicate, XtFindFile returns NULL.</p>

<p>If the predicate parameter is NULL, an internal
procedure that checks if the file exists, is readable, and
is not a directory will be used.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the caller to free the
returned string using XtFree when it is no longer
needed.</p>
