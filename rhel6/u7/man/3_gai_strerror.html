<p>DESCRIPTION Given node and service, which identify an
Internet host and a service, getaddrinfo() returns one or
more addrinfo structures, each of which contains an Internet
address that can be specified in a call to bind(2) or
connect(2). The getaddrinfo() function combines the
functionality provided by the getservbyname(3) and
getservbyport(3) functions into a single interface, but
unlike the latter functions, getaddrinfo() is reentrant and
allows programs to eliminate IPv4-versus-IPv6 dependen-
cies.</p>

<p>The addrinfo structure used by getaddrinfo() contains
the following fields:</p>

<p>struct addrinfo { int ai_flags; int ai_family; int
ai_socktype; int ai_protocol; size_t ai_addrlen; struct
sockaddr *ai_addr; char *ai_canonname; struct addrinfo
*ai_next; };</p>

<p>The hints argument points to an addrinfo structure that
specifies cri- teria for selecting the socket address
structures returned in the list pointed to by res. If hints
is not NULL it points to an addrinfo structure whose
ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol specify crite- ria
that limit the set of socket addresses returned by
getaddrinfo(), as follows:</p>

<p>ai_family This field specifies the desired address
family for the returned addresses. Valid values for this
field include AF_INET and AF_INET6. The value AF_UNSPEC
indicates that getaddrinfo() should return socket addresses
for any address family (either IPv4 or IPv6, for example)
that can be used with node and service.</p>

<p>ai_socktype This field specifies the preferred socket
type, for example SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM. Specifying 0 in
this field indicates that socket addresses of any type can
be returned by getaddrinfo().</p>

<p>ai_protocol This field specifies the protocol for the
returned socket addresses. Specifying 0 in this field
indicates that socket addresses with any protocol can be
returned by getaddrinfo().</p>

<p>ai_flags This field specifies additional options,
described below. Multiple flags are specified by logically
OR-ing them together.</p>

<p>All the other fields in the structure pointed to by
hints must contain either 0 or a null pointer, as
appropriate. Specifying hints as NULL is equivalent to
setting ai_socktype and ai_protocol to 0; ai_family to
AF_UNSPEC; and ai_flags to (AI_V4MAPPED |
AI_ADDRCONFIG).</p>

<p>node specifies either a numerical network address (for
IPv4, numbers- and-dots notation as supported by
inet_aton(3); for IPv6, hexadecimal string format as
supported by inet_pton(3)), or a network hostname, whose
network addresses are looked up and resolved. If
hints.ai_flags contains the AI_NUMERICHOST flag then node
must be a numerical network address. The AI_NUMERICHOST flag
suppresses any potentially lengthy network host address
lookups.</p>

<p>If the AI_PASSIVE flag is specified in hints.ai_flags,
and node is NULL, then the returned socket addresses will be
suitable for bind(2)ing a socket that will accept(2)
connections. The returned socket address will contain the
&quot;wildcard address&quot; (INADDR_ANY for IPv4 addresses,
IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT for IPv6 address). The wildcard address is
used by applications (typically servers) that intend to
accept connec- tions on any of the hostss network addresses.
If node is not NULL, then the AI_PASSIVE flag is
ignored.</p>

<p>If the AI_PASSIVE flag is not set in hints.ai_flags,
then the returned socket addresses will be suitable for use
with connect(2), sendto(2), or sendmsg(2). If node is NULL,
then the network address will be set to the loopback
interface address (INADDR_LOOPBACK for IPv4 addresses,
IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT for IPv6 address); this is used by
applications that intend to communicate with peers running
on the same host.</p>

<p>service sets the port in each returned address
structure. If this argument is a service name (see
services(5)), it is translated to the corresponding port
number. This argument can also be specified as a decimal
number, which is simply converted to binary. If service is
NULL, then the port number of the returned socket addresses
will be left uninitialized. If AI_NUMERICSERV is specified
in hints.ai_flags and service is not NULL, then service must
point to a string containing a numeric port number. This
flag is used to inhibit the invocation of a name resolution
service in cases where it is known not to be required.</p>

<p>Either node or service, but not both, may be NULL.</p>

<p>The getaddrinfo() function allocates and initializes a
linked list of addrinfo structures, one for each network
address that matches node and service, subject to any
restrictions imposed by hints, and returns a pointer to the
start of the list in res. The items in the linked list are
linked by the ai_next field.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why the linked list may have
more than one addrinfo structure, including: the network
host is multi-homed, acces- sible over multiple protocols
(e.g. both AF_INET and AF_INET6); or the same service is
available from multiple socket types (one SOCK_STREAM
address and another SOCK_DGRAM address, for example).
Normally, the application should try using the addresses in
the order in which they are returned. The sorting function
used within getaddrinfo() is defined in RFC 3484; the order
can be tweaked for a particular system by editing
/etc/gai.conf (available since glibc 2.5).</p>

<p>If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_CANONNAME flag, then
the ai_canonname field of the first of the addrinfo
structures in the returned list is set to point to the
official name of the host.</p>

<p>The remaining fields of each returned addrinfo structure
are initial- ized as follows:</p>

<p>* The ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol fields
return the socket creation parameters (i.e., these fields
have the same meaning as the corresponding arguments of
socket(2)). For example, ai_family might return AF_INET or
AF_INET6; ai_socktype might return SOCK_DGRAM or
SOCK_STREAM; and ai_protocol returns the protocol for the
socket.</p>

<p>* A pointer to the socket address is placed in the
ai_addr field, and the length of the socket address, in
bytes, is placed in the ai_addrlen field.</p>

<p>If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag, then
IPv4 addresses are returned in the list pointed to by result
only if the local system has at least one IPv4 address
configured, and IPv6 addresses are only returned if the
local system has at least one IPv6 address configured.</p>

<p>If hint.ai_flags specifies the AI_V4MAPPED flag, and
hints.ai_family was specified as AF_INET6, and no matching
IPv6 addresses could be found, then return IPv4-mapped IPv6
addresses in the list pointed to by result. If both
AI_V4MAPPED and AI_ALL are specified in hints.ai_fam- ily,
then return both IPv6 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in the
list pointed to by result. AI_ALL is ignored if AI_V4MAPPED
is not also specified.</p>

<p>The freeaddrinfo() function frees the memory that was
allocated for the dynamically allocated linked list res.</p>

<p>Extensions to getaddrinfo() for Internationalized Domain
Names Starting with glibc 2.3.4, getaddrinfo() has been
extended to selec- tively allow the incoming and outgoing
hostnames to be transparently converted to and from the
Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) format (see RFC 3490,
Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)).
Four new flags are defined:</p>

<p>AI_IDN If this flag is specified, then the node name
given in node is converted to IDN format if necessary. The
source encoding is that of the current locale.</p>

<p>If the input name contains non-ASCII characters, then
the IDN encoding is used. Those parts of the node name
(delimited by dots) that contain non-ASCII characters are
encoded using ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) before being
passed to the name reso- lution functions.</p>

<p>AI_CANONIDN After a successful name lookup, and if the
AI_CANONNAME flag was specified, getaddrinfo() will return
the canonical name of the node corresponding to the addrinfo
structure value passed back. The return value is an exact
copy of the value returned by the name resolution
function.</p>

<p>If the name is encoded using ACE, then it will contain
the xn-- prefix for one or more components of the name. To
convert these components into a readable form the
AI_CANONIDN flag can be passed in addition to AI_CANONNAME.
The resulting string is encoded using the current locales
encoding.</p>

<p>AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES
Setting these flags will enable the IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED
(allow unassigned Unicode code points) and
IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES (check output to make sure it is a
STD3 conforming hostname) flags respectively to be used in
the IDNA handling.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE getaddrinfo() returns 0 if it succeeds, or
one of the following non- zero error codes:</p>

<p>EAI_ADDRFAMILY The specified network host does not have
any network addresses in the requested address family.</p>

<p>EAI_AGAIN The name server returned a temporary failure
indication. Try again later.</p>

<p>EAI_BADFLAGS hints.ai_flags contains invalid flags; or,
hints.ai_flags included AI_CANONNAME and name was NULL.</p>

<p>EAI_FAIL The name server returned a permanent failure
indication.</p>

<p>EAI_FAMILY The requested address family is not
supported.</p>

<p>EAI_MEMORY Out of memory.</p>

<p>EAI_NODATA The specified network host exists, but does
not have any network addresses defined.</p>

<p>EAI_NONAME The node or service is not known; or both
node and service are NULL; or AI_NUMERICSERV was specified
in hints.ai_flags and ser- vice was not a numeric
port-number string.</p>

<p>EAI_SERVICE The requested service is not available for
the requested socket type. It may be available through
another socket type. For example, this error could occur if
service was &quot;shell&quot; (a ser- vice only available on
stream sockets), and either hints.ai_pro- tocol was
IPPROTO_UDP, or hints.ai_socktype was SOCK_DGRAM; or the
error could occur if service was not NULL, and
hints.ai_socktype was SOCK_RAW (a socket type that does not
sup- port the concept of services).</p>

<p>EAI_SOCKTYPE The requested socket type is not supported.
This could occur, for example, if hints.ai_socktype and
hints.ai_protocol are inconsistent (e.g., SOCK_DGRAM and
IPPROTO_TCP, repectively).</p>

<p>EAI_SYSTEM Other system error, check errno for
details.</p>

<p>The gai_strerror() function translates these error codes
to a human readable string, suitable for error
reporting.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/gai.conf</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001. The getaddrinfo() function
is documented in RFC 2553.</p>

<p>NOTES getaddrinfo() supports the address%scope-id
notation for specifying the IPv6 scope-ID.</p>

<p>AI_ADDRCONFIG, AI_ALL, and AI_V4MAPPED are available
since glibc 2.3.3. AI_NUMERICSERV is available since glibc
2.3.4.</p>
