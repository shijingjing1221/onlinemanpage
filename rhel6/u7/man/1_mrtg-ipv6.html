<p>NAME mrtg-ipv6 - IPv6 support in MRTG</p>

<p>OVERVIEW MRTG and cfgmaker support SNMP over IPv6. IPv6
targets can be specified by hostname or IPv6 address, and if
the required libraries are present (see below), queries will
use IPv6.</p>

<p>USAGE Enabling IPv6</p>

<p>IPv6 is currently disabled by default and must be
explicitly enabled. In MRTG this is done by turning on the
EnableIPv6 global option in the configuration file. In
cfgmaker, it is enabled with the --enable-ipv6 command-line
option.</p>

<p>If IPv6 is disabled, MRTG and cfgmaker should behave in
exactly the same way as previous versions. So the addition
of IPv6 support should have no effect on existing MRTG
setups unless IPv6 is enabled.</p>

<p>IPv6 support requires the Socket6 and INET6 libraries
(see below). If MRTG cant find them, IPv6 is disabled.</p>

<p>Specifying IPv6 targets</p>

<p>IPv6 targets may be specified by name or IPv6 address.
Numeric IPv6 addresses may be used with both cfgmaker and
MRTG, but they must be enclosed in square brackets.</p>

<p>For example, a target could be specified as:</p>

<p>public@[2001:760:4::]:161</p>

<p>Hostnames work as expected: first an IPv6 name lookup is
tried, then an IPv4 lookup.</p>

<p>Targets that do not support SNMP over IPv6</p>

<p>Many targets (this currently includes all Cisco routers)
do not yet support SNMP over IPv6 and must be monitored over
IPv4. This can cause problems if you specify a target
through its DNS name and the name maps to both the IPv6
address and the IPv4 address of the target: MRTG will only
try IPv6, and will fail.</p>

<p>To query these targets, use the IPv4Only per-target
option, which tells MRTG not to use SNMP over IPv6 for the
target.</p>

<p>MRTG does not fall back to IPv4 for performance and
correctness rea- sons. If there are many routers to query, a
timeout for every router would make MRTG take too long to
query them all. And if, for some rea- son, IPv6 connectivity
to the target is lost, MRTGs error messages can help figure
out what is wrong.</p>

<p>cfgmaker does fall back from IPv6 to IPv4. If IPv6 is
enabled and cfg- maker is given a hostname that resolves to
both an IPv6 and an IPv4 address, it first tries to query
the target over IPv6. If it receives no answer, it tries
again using IPv4. If the target answers, cfgmaker sets the
IPv4Only option in the generated config file.</p>

<p>IPv6 LIBRARIES Libraries required</p>

<p>IPv6 support requires the Socket6 and INET6 Perl
modules. Both can be downloaded from CPAN:</p>

<p>http://search.cpan.org/author/UMEMOTO/Socket6/</p>

<p>http://search.cpan.org/author/MONDEJAR/INET6/</p>

<p>If you use Debian, you will need the packages
libsocket6-perl and libio-socket-inet6-perl, which are (or
should soon be) in unstable.</p>

<p>So far, IPv6 support has been tested on Linux only, and
only with Socket6 version 0.12. Also note that IPv6 wont
work at all if you dont have INET6.pm version 2.00 or
newer.</p>

<p>Installing the libraries</p>

<p>Building and installing Socket6 and INET6 is very
simple. For each mod- ule, just unpack the archive and then
do:</p>

<p>perl Makefile.PL make</p>

<p>and then:</p>

<p>su make install</p>

<p>If you have installed the libraries successfully,
cfgmaker and mrtg should automatically detect them and allow
IPv6 support to be enabled.</p>
