<p>NAME rndc - name server control utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rndc [-b source-address] [-c config-file] [-k
key-file] [-s server] [-p port] [-V] [-y key_id]
{command}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rndc controls the operation of a name
server. It supersedes the ndc utility that was provided in
old BIND releases. If rndc is invoked with no command line
options or arguments, it prints a short summary of the
supported commands and the available options and their
arguments.</p>

<p>rndc communicates with the name server over a TCP
connection, sending commands authenticated with digital
signatures. In the current versions of rndc and named, the
only supported authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5, which
uses a shared secret on each end of the connection. This
provides TSIG-style authentication for the command request
and the name servers response. All commands sent over the
channel must be signed by a key_id known to the server.</p>

<p>rndc reads a configuration file to determine how to
contact the name server and decide what algorithm and key it
should use.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b source-address Use source-address as the
source address for the connection to the server. Multiple
instances are permitted to allow setting of both the IPv4
and IPv6 source addresses.</p>

<p>-c config-file Use config-file as the configuration file
instead of the default, /etc/rndc.conf.</p>

<p>-k key-file Use key-file as the key file instead of the
default, /etc/rndc.key. The key in /etc/rndc.key will be
used to authenticate commands sent to the server if the
config-file does not exist.</p>

<p>-s server server is the name or address of the server
which matches a server statement in the configuration file
for rndc. If no server is supplied on the command line, the
host named by the default-server clause in the options
statement of the rndc configuration file will be used.</p>

<p>-p port Send commands to TCP port port instead of BIND
9s default control channel port, 953.</p>

<p>-V Enable verbose logging.</p>

<p>-y key_id Use the key key_id from the configuration
file. key_id must be known by named with the same algorithm
and secret string in order for control message validation to
succeed. If no key_id is specified, rndc will first look for
a key clause in the server statement of the server being
used, or if no server statement is present for that host,
then the default-key clause of the options statement. Note
that the configuration file contains shared secrets which
are used to send authenticated control commands to name
servers. It should therefore not have general read or write
access.</p>

<p>For the complete set of commands supported by rndc, see
the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual or run rndc
without arguments to see its help message.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS rndc does not yet support all the commands
of the BIND 8 ndc utility.</p>

<p>There is currently no way to provide the shared secret
for a key_id without using the configuration file.</p>

<p>Several error messages could be clearer.</p>
