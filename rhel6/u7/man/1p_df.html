<p>DF(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual DF(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME df - report free disk space</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS df [-k][-P|-t][file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The df utility shall write the amount of
available space and file slots for file systems on which the
invoking user has appropriate read access. File systems
shall be specified by the file operands; when none are
specified, information shall be written for all file
systems. The format of the default output from df is
unspecified, but all space fig- ures are reported in
512-byte units, unless the -k option is specified. This
output shall contain at least the file system names, amount
of available space on each of these file systems, and the
number of free file slots, or inodes, available; when -t is
specified, the output shall contain the total allocated
space as well.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The df utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-k Use 1024-byte units, instead of the default 512-byte
units, when writing space figures.</p>

<p>-P Produce output in the format described in the STDOUT
section.</p>

<p>-t Include total allocated-space figures in the
output.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file within the hierarchy of the
desired file system. If a file other than a FIFO, a regular
file, a direc- tory, or a special file representing the
device containing the file system (for example,
/dev/dsk/0s1) is specified, the results are unspecified.
Otherwise, df shall write the amount of free space in the
file system containing the specified file operand.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of df:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error and informative messages written
to standard output.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT When both the -k and -P options are specified,
the following header line shall be written (in the POSIX
locale):</p>

<p>&quot;Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity
Mounted on&quot;</p>

<p>When the -P option is specified without the -k option,
the following header line shall be written (in the POSIX
locale):</p>

<p>&quot;Filesystem 512-blocks Used Available Capacity
Mounted on&quot;</p>

<p>The implementation may adjust the spacing of the header
line and the individual data lines so that the information
is presented in orderly columns.</p>

<p>The remaining output with -P shall consist of one line
of information for each specified file system. These lines
shall be formatted as fol- lows:</p>

<p>&quot;%s %d %d %d %d%% %n&quot;, &lt;file system
name&gt;, &lt;total space&gt;, &lt;space used&gt;, &lt;space
free&gt;, &lt;percentage used&gt;, &lt;file system
root&gt;</p>

<p>In the following list, all quantities expressed in
512-byte units (1024-byte when -k is specified) shall be
rounded up to the next higher unit. The fields are:</p>

<p>&lt;file system name&gt;</p>

<p>The name of the file system, in an
implementation-defined for- mat.</p>

<p>&lt;total space&gt; The total size of the file system in
512-byte units. The exact meaning of this figure is
implementation-defined, but should include &lt;space
used&gt;, &lt;space free&gt;, plus any space reserved by the
system not normally available to a user.</p>

<p>&lt;space used&gt; The total amount of space allocated
to existing files in the file system, in 512-byte units.</p>

<p>&lt;space free&gt; The total amount of space available
within the file system for the creation of new files by
unprivileged users, in 512-byte units. When this figure is
less than or equal to zero, it shall not be possible to
create any new files on the file system with- out first
deleting others, unless the process has appropriate
privileges. The figure written may be less than zero.</p>

<p>&lt;percentage used&gt;</p>

<p>The percentage of the normally available space that is
currently allocated to all files on the file system. This
shall be calcu- lated using the fraction:</p>

<p>&lt;space used&gt;/( &lt;space used&gt;+ &lt;space
free&gt;)</p>

<p>expressed as a percentage. This percentage may be
greater than 100 if &lt;space free&gt; is less than zero.
The percentage value shall be expressed as a positive
integer, with any fractional result causing it to be rounded
to the next highest integer.</p>

<p>&lt;file system root&gt;</p>

<p>The directory below which the file system hierarchy
appears.</p>

<p>The output format is unspecified when -t is used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE On most systems, the &quot;name of the
file system, in an implementation- defined format&quot; is
the special file on which the file system is mounted.</p>

<p>On large file systems, the calculation specified for
percentage used can create huge rounding errors.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. The following example writes portable
information about the /usr file system:</p>

<p>df -P /usr</p>

<p>2. Assuming that /usr/src is part of the /usr file
system, the follow- ing produces the same output as the
previous example:</p>

<p>df -P /usr/src</p>

<p>RATIONALE The behavior of df with the -P option is the
default action of the 4.2 BSD df utility. The uppercase -P
was selected to avoid collision with a known industry
extension using -p.</p>

<p>Historical df implementations vary considerably in their
default out- put. It was therefore necessary to describe the
default output in a loose manner to accommodate all known
historical implementations and to add a portable option (
-P) to provide information in a portable for- mat.</p>

<p>The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and
maintains compati- bility with ls and other utilities in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. This does not mandate
that the file system itself be based on 512-byte blocks. The
-k option was added as a compromise measure. It was agreed
by the standard developers that 512 bytes was the best
default unit because of its complete historical consistency
on System V (versus the mixed 512/1024-byte usage on BSD
systems), and that a -k option to switch to 1024-byte units
was a good compromise. Users who prefer the more logical
1024-byte quantity can easily alias df to df -k without
breaking many historical scripts relying on the 512-byte
units.</p>

<p>It was suggested that df and the various related
utilities be modified to access a BLOCKSIZE environment
variable to achieve consistency and user acceptance. Since
this is not historical practice on any system, it is left as
a possible area for system extensions and will be re-
evaluated in a future version if it is widely
implemented.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
