<p>DES_CRYPT(3) Linux Programmer s Manual DES_CRYPT(3)</p>

<p>NAME des_crypt, ecb_crypt, cbc_crypt, des_setparity,
DES_FAILED - fast DES encryption</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;rpc/des_crypt.h&gt;</p>

<p>int ecb_crypt(char *key, char *data, unsigned datalen,
unsigned mode);</p>

<p>int cbc_crypt(char *key, char *data, unsigned datalen,
unsigned mode, char *ivec);</p>

<p>void des_setparity(char *key);</p>

<p>int DES_FAILED(int status);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ecb_crypt() and cbc_crypt() implement the
NBS DES (Data Encryption Standard). These routines are
faster and more general purpose than crypt(3). They also are
able to utilize DES hardware if it is avail- able.
ecb_crypt() encrypts in ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode,
which encrypts blocks of data independently. cbc_crypt()
encrypts in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, which chains
together successive blocks. CBC mode protects against
insertions, deletions and substitutions of blocks. Also,
regularities in the clear text will not appear in the cipher
text.</p>

<p>Here is how to use these routines. The first argument,
key, is the 8-byte encryption key with parity. To set the
key s parity, which for DES is in the low bit of each byte,
use des_setparity(). The second argument, data, contains the
data to be encrypted or decrypted. The third argument,
datalen, is the length in bytes of data, which must be a
multiple of 8. The fourth argument, mode, is formed by OR
ing together some things. For the encryption direction OR in
either DES_ENCRYPT or DES_DECRYPT. For software versus
hardware encryption, OR in either DES_HW or DES_SW. If
DES_HW is specified, and there is no hardware, then the
encryption is performed in software and the routine returns
DESERR_NOHWDEVICE. For cbc_crypt(), the argument ivec is the
8-byte initialization vector for the chaining. It is updated
to the next initialization vector upon return.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE DESERR_NONE No error. DESERR_NOHWDEVICE
Encryption succeeded, but done in software instead of the
requested hardware. DESERR_HWERROR An error occurred in the
hardware or driver. DESERR_BADPARAM Bad argument to
routine.</p>

<p>Given a result status stat, the macro DES_FAILED(stat)
is false only for the first two statuses.</p>

<p>VERSIONS These routines are present in libc 4.6.27 and
later, and in glibc 2.1 and later.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD. Not in POSIX.1-2001.</p>
