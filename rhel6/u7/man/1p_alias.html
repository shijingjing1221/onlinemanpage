<p>ALIAS(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ALIAS(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME alias - define or display aliases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS alias [alias-name[=string] ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The alias utility shall create or redefine
alias definitions or write the values of existing alias
definitions to standard output. An alias definition provides
a string value that shall replace a command name when it is
encountered; see Alias Substitution .</p>

<p>An alias definition shall affect the current shell
execution environ- ment and the execution environments of
the subshells of the current shell. When used as specified
by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the alias definition
shall not affect the parent process of the current shell nor
any utility environment invoked by the shell; see Shell Exe-
cution Environment .</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>alias-name Write the alias definition to standard
output.</p>

<p>alias-name=string</p>

<p>Assign the value of string to the alias alias-name.</p>

<p>If no operands are given, all alias definitions shall be
written to standard output.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of alias:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The format for displaying aliases (when no
operands or only name operands are specified) shall be:</p>

<p>&quot;%s=%n&quot;, name, value</p>

<p>The value string shall be written with appropriate
quoting so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell. See
the description of shell quoting in Quoting .</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 One of the name operands specified did not have an
alias defini- tion, or an error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Change ls to give a columnated, more
annotated output:</p>

<p>alias ls=&quot;ls -CF&quot;</p>

<p>2. Create a simple &quot;redo&quot; command to repeat
previous entries in the command history file:</p>

<p>alias rfc -s</p>

<p>3. Use 1K units for du:</p>

<p>alias du=du-k</p>

<p>4. Set up nohup so that it can deal with an argument
that is itself an alias name:</p>

<p>alias nohup=&quot;nohup &quot;</p>

<p>RATIONALE The alias description is based on historical
KornShell implementations. Known differences exist between
that and the C shell. The KornShell version was adopted to
be consistent with all the other KornShell fea- tures in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, such as command line
editing.</p>

<p>Since alias affects the current shell execution
environment, it is gen- erally provided as a shell regular
built-in.</p>

<p>Historical versions of the KornShell have allowed
aliases to be exported to scripts that are invoked by the
same shell. This is trig- gered by the alias -x flag; it is
allowed by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 only when an
explicit extension such as -x is used. The standard
developers considered that aliases were of use pri- marily
to interactive users and that they should normally not
affect shell scripts called by those users; functions are
available to such scripts.</p>

<p>Historical versions of the KornShell had not written
aliases in a quoted manner suitable for reentry to the
shell, but this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 has made this
a requirement for all similar out- put. Therefore,
consistency with this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 was
chosen over this detail of historical practice.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
