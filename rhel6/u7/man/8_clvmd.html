<p>NAME clvmd cluster LVM daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS clvmd [-C] [-d[&lt;value&gt;]] [-E &lt;lock
uuid&gt;] [-f] [-h] [-I cluster_man- ager] [-R] [-S] [-t
&lt;timeout&gt;] [-T &lt;start timeout&gt;] [-V]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION clvmd is the daemon that distributes LVM
metadata updates around a cluster. It must be running on all
nodes in the cluster and will give an error if a node in the
cluster does not have this daemon running.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d[&lt;value&gt;] Set debug logging level.If -d
is specified without a value then 1 is assumed. Value can
be:</p>

<p>0 Disabled</p>

<p>1 Sends debug logs to stderr (implies -f)</p>

<p>2 Sends debug logs to syslog(3)</p>

<p>-C Only valid if -d is also specified. Tells all clvmds
in a clus- ter to enable/disable debug logging. Without this
switch, only the local clvmd will change its debug level to
that given with -d This does not work correctly if specified
on the command-line that starts clvmd. If you want to start
clvmd and enable clus- ter-wide logging then the command
needs to be issued twice, eg: clvmd clvmd -d2</p>

<p>-E&lt;lock uuid&gt; Pass lock uuid to be reacquired
exclusively when clvmd is restarted.</p>

<p>-f Dont fork, run in the foreground.</p>

<p>-h Show help information.</p>

<p>-I cluster_manager Selects the cluster manager to use
for locking and internal com- munications. As it is quite
possible to have multiple managers available on the same
system you might have to manually specify this option to
override the search.</p>

<p>By default, omit -I is equivalent to -Iauto. Clvmd will
use the first cluster manager that succeeds, and it checks
them in a predefined order cman,corosync,openais. The
available managers will be listed by order as part of the
clvmd -h output.</p>

<p>-R Tells all the running instance of clvmd in the
cluster to reload their device cache and re-read the lvm
configuration file lvm.conf(5). This command should be run
whenever the devices on a cluster system are changed.</p>

<p>-S Tells the running clvmd to exit and reexecute itself,
for exam- ple at the end of a package upgrade. The new
instance is instructed to reacquire any locks in the same
state as they were previously held. (Alternative methods of
restarting the daemon have the side effect of changing
exclusive LV locks into shared locks.)</p>

<p>-t&lt;timeout&gt; Specifies the timeout for commands to
run around the cluster. This should not be so small that
commands with many disk updates to do will fail, so you may
need to increase this on systems with very large disk farms.
The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>-T&lt;start timeout&gt; Specifies the start timeout for
clvmd daemon startup. If the daemon does not report that it
has started up within this time then the parent command will
exit with status of 5. This does NOT mean that clvmd has not
started! What it means is that the startup has been delayed
for some reason; the most likely cause of this is an
inquorate cluster though it could be due to lock- ing
latencies on a cluster with large numbers of logical vol-
umes. If you get the return code of 5 it is usually not
neces- sary to restart clvmd it will start as soon as that
blockage has cleared. This flag is to allow startup scripts
to exit in a timely fashion even if the cluster is stalled
for some reason.</p>

<p>The default is 0 (no timeout) and the value is in
seconds. Dont set this too small or you will experience
spurious errors. 10 or 20 seconds might be sensible.</p>

<p>This timeout will be ignored if you start clvmd with the
-d.</p>

<p>-V Display the version of the cluster LVM daemon.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES LVM_CLVMD_BINARY The CLVMD binary
to use when clmvd restart is requested. Defaults to
/usr/sbin/clvmd.</p>

<p>LVM_BINARY The LVM2 binary to use. Defaults to
/sbin/lvm.</p>
