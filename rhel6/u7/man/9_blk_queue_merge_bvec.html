<p>BLK_QUEUE_MERGE_BVEC(9) Block Devices
BLK_QUEUE_MERGE_BVEC(9)</p>

<p>NAME blk_queue_merge_bvec - set a merge_bvec function
for queue</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void blk_queue_merge_bvec(struct request_queue
* q, merge_bvec_fn * mbfn);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS q queue</p>

<p>mbfn merge_bvec_fn</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Usually queues have static limitations on
the max sectors or segments that we can put in a request.
Stacking drivers may have some settings that are dynamic,
and thus we have to query the queue whether it is ok to add
a new bio_vec to a bio at a given offset or not. If the
block device has such limitations, it needs to register a
merge_bvec_fn to control the size of bio&acute;s sent to it.
Note that a block device *must* allow a single page to be
added to an empty bio. The block device driver may want to
use the bio_split function to deal with these bio&acute;s.
By default no merge_bvec_fn is defined for a queue, and only
the fixed limits are honored.</p>
