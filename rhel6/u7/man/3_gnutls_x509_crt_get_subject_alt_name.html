<p>NAME gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name - Get
certificates alternative name, if any</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/x509.h&gt;</p>

<p>int
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name(gnutls_x509_crt_t cert,
unsigned int seq, void * ret, size_t * ret_size, unsigned
int * criti- cal);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_x509_crt_t cert should contain a
gnutls_x509_crt_t structure</p>

<p>unsigned int seq specifies the sequence number of the
alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)</p>

<p>void * ret is the place where the alternative name will
be copied to</p>

<p>size_t * ret_size holds the size of ret.</p>

<p>unsigned int * critical will be non zero if the
extension is marked as critical (may be null)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will return the alternative
names, contained in the given certificate.</p>

<p>This is specified in X509v3 Certificate Extensions.
GNUTLS will return the Alternative name (2.5.29.17), or a
negative error code.</p>

<p>When the SAN type is otherName, it will extract the data
in the other- Names value field, and GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME is
returned. You may use
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid() to get the
correspond- ing OID and the &quot;virtual&quot; SAN types
(e.g., GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP).</p>

<p>If an otherName OID is known, the data will be decoded.
Otherwise the returned data will be DER encoded, and you
will have to decode it your- self. Currently, only the RFC
3920 id-on-xmppAddr SAN is recognized.</p>

<p>RETURNS the alternative subject name type on success,
one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t. It
will return GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEM- ORY_BUFFER if ret_size is
not large enough to hold the value. In that case ret_size
will be updated with the required size. If the certifi- cate
does not have an Alternative name with the specified
sequence num- ber then GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE
is returned.</p>
