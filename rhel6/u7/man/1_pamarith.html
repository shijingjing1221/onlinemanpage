<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pamarith reads two PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM images as
input. It performs the specified binary arithmetic operation
on their sample values and produces an output of a format
which is the more general of the two input formats. The two
input images must be of the same width and height. The
arithmetic is performed on each pair of identically located
tuples to generate the identically located tuple of the
output.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the calculation, it assumes any PBM,
PGM, or PPM input image is the equivalent PAM image of tuple
type BLACKANDWHITE, GRAYSCALE, or RGB, respectively, and if
it produces a PBM, PGM, or PPM output, produces the
equivalent of the PAM image which is the result of the
calculation.</p>

<p>The first pamfile argument identifies the left argument
image; the second pamfile argument identifies the right
one.</p>

<p>If the output is PAM, the tuple type is the same as the
tuple type of the left input image.</p>

<p>pamarith performs the arithmetic on each pair of
identically located tuples in the two input images.</p>

<p>The arithmetic operation is in all cases fundamentally a
function from two integers to an integer. The operation is
performed on two tuples as follows. The two input images
must have the same depth, or one of them must have depth
one. pamarith fails if one of these is not the case.</p>

<p>If they have the same depth, pamarith simply carries out
the arithmetic one sample at a time. I.e. if at a particular
position the left input image contains the tuple
(s1,s2,...,sN) and the right input image con- tains the
tuple (t1,t2,...tN), and the function is f, then the output
image contains the tuple
(f(s1,t1),f(s2,t2),...,f(sN,tN)).</p>

<p>If one of the images has depth 1, the arithmetic is
performed between the one sample in that image and each of
the samples in the other. I.e. if at a particular position
the left input image contains the tuple (s) and the right
input image contains the tuple (t1,t2,...tN), and the
function is f, then the output image contains the tuple
(f(s,t1),f(s,t2),...,f(s,tN)).</p>

<p>Maxval The meanings of the samples with respect to the
maxval varies according to the function you select.</p>

<p>In PAM images in general, the most usual meaning of a
sample (the one that applies when a PAM image represents a
visual image), is that it represents a fraction of some
maximum. The maxval of the image corre- sponds to some
maximum value (in the case of a visual image, it corre-
sponds to full intensity.), and a sample value divided by
the maxval gives the fraction.</p>

<p>For pamarith, this interpretation applies to the regular
arithmetic functions: -add, -subtract, -multiply, -divide,
-difference, -minimum, -maximum, -mean, and -compare. For
those, you should think of the arguments and result as
numbers in the range [0,1). For example, if the maxval of
the left argument image is 100 and the maxval of the right
argument image is 200 and the maxval of the output image is
200, and the left sample value in an -add calculation is 50
and the right sample is 60, the actual calculation is 50/100
+ 60/200 = 160/200, and the output sample value is 160.</p>

<p>For these functions, pamarith makes the output image s
maxval the maxi- mum of the two input maxvals, except with
-compare, where pamarith uses an output maxval of 2. (Before
Netpbm 10.14 (February 2003), there was no exception for
-compare; in 10.14, the exception was just that the maxval
was at least 2, and sometime between 10.18 and 10.26
(January 2005), it changed to being exactly 2).</p>

<p>If the result of a calculation falls outside the range
[0, 1), pamarith clips it -- i.e. considers it to be zero or
1-.</p>

<p>In many cases, where both your input maxvals are the
same, you can just think of the operation as taking place
between the sample values directly, with no consideration of
the maxval except for the clipping. E.g. an -add of sample
value 5 to sample value 8 yields sample value 13.</p>

<p>But with -multiply, this doesnt work. Say your two input
images have maxval 255, which means the output image also
has maxval 255. Consider a location in the image where the
input sample values are 5 and 10. You might think the
multiplicative product of those would yield 50 in the
output. But pamarith carries out the arithmetic on the
fractions 5/255 and 10/255. It multiplies those together and
then rescales to the output maxval, giving a sample value in
the output PAM of 50/255 rounded to the nearest integer:
0.</p>

<p>With the bit string operations, the maxval has a whole
different mean- ing. The operations in question are: -and,
-or, -nand, -nor, -xor, and -shiftleft, -shiftright.</p>

<p>With these, each sample value in one or both input
images, and in the output image, represents a bit string,
not a number. The maxval tells how wide the bit string is.
The maxval must be a full binary count (a power of two minus
one, such as 0xff) and the number of ones in it is the width
of the bit string. For the dyadic bit string operations
(thats everything but the shift functions), the maxvals of
the input images must be the same and pamarith makes the
maxval of the output image the same.</p>

<p>For the bit shift operations, the output maxval is the
same as the left input maxval. The right input image (which
contains the shift counts) can have any maxval and the
maxval is irrelevant to the interpretation of the samples.
The sample value is the actual shift count. But its still
required that no sample value exceed the maxval.</p>

<p>The Operations Most of the operations are obvious from
the option name. The following paragraphs cover those that
arent.</p>

<p>-subtract subtracts a value in the right input image
from a value in the left input image.</p>

<p>-difference calculates the absolute value of the
difference.</p>

<p>-multiply does an ordinary arithmetic multiplication,
but tends to pro- duce nonobvious results because of the way
pamarith interprets sample values. See Maxval .</p>

<p>-divide divides a value in the left input image by the
value in the left input image. But like -multiply, it tends
to produce nonobvious results. Note that pamarith clipping
behavior makes this of little use when the left argument
(dividend) is greater than the right argument (divisor) --
the result in that case is always the maxval. If the divisor
is 0, the result is the maxval. This option was new in
Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).</p>

<p>-compare produces the value 0 when the value in the left
input image is less than the value in the right input image,
1 when the values are equal, and 2 when the left is greater
than the right.</p>

<p>If the maxvals of the input images are not identical,
pamarith may claim two values are not equal when in fact
they are, due to the preci- sion with which it does the
arithmetic. However, it will never say A is greater than B
if A is less than B.</p>

<p>-compare was new in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002).</p>

<p>-and, -nand, -or, -nor, and -xor consider the input and
output images to contain bit strings; they compute bitwise
logic operations. Note that if the maxval is 1, you can also
look at these as logic operations on boolean input values.
See section Maxval for the special meaning of maxval with
respect to bit string operations such as these.</p>

<p>-shiftleft and -shiftright consider the left input image
and output image to contain bit strings. They compute a bit
shift operation, with bits falling off the left or right end
and zeroes shifting in, as opposed to bits off one end to
the other. The right input image sample value is the number
of bit positions to shift.</p>

<p>Note that the maxval (see Maxval ) determines the width
of the frame within which you are shifting.</p>

<p>Notes If you want to apply a unary function, e.g.
&quot;halve&quot;, to a single image, use pamfunc.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pamfunc(1), pamsummcol(1), pamsumm(1),

<p>HISTORY pamarith replaced pnmarith in Netpbm 10.3 (June
2002).</p>

<p>In Netpbm 10.3 through 10.8, though, pamarith was not
backward compati- ble because it required the input images
to be of the same depth, so you could not multiply a PBM by
a PPM as is often done for masking. (It was not intended at
the time that pnmarith would be removed from Netpbm -- the
plan was just to rewrite it to use pamarith; it was removed
by mistake).</p>

<p>But starting with Netpbm 10.9 (September 2002), pamarith
allows the images to have different depths as long as one of
them has depth 1, and that made it backward compatible with
pnmarith.</p>

<p>The original pnmarith did not have the -mean option.</p>

<p>The -compare option was added in Netpbm 10.13 (December
2002).</p>

<p>The bit string operations were added in Netpbm 10.27
(March 2005).</p>

<p>The -divide option was added in Netpbm 10.30 (October
2005).</p>
