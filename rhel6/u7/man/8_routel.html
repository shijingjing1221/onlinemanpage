<p>ROUTEL(8) Linux ROUTEL(8)</p>

<p>NAME routel - list routes with pretty output format
routef - flush routes</p>

<p>SYNTAX routel [tablenr [raw ip args...]] routef</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These programs are a set of helper scripts
you can use instead of raw iproute2 commands. The routel
script will list routes in a format that some might consider
easier to interpret then the ip route list equivalent. The
routef script does not take any arguments and will simply
flush the routing table down the drain. Beware! This means
deleting all routes which will make your network
unusable!</p>

<p>FILES /usr/bin/routef /usr/bin/routel</p>

<p>AUTHORS The routel script was written by Stephen R. van
den Berg &lt;srb@cuci.nl&gt;, 1999/04/18 and donated to the
public domain. This manual page was written by Andreas
Henriksson &lt;andreas@fatal.se&gt;, for the Debian
GNU/Linux system.</p>
