<p>NAME pluginviewer - list loadable SASL plugins and their
properties</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pluginviewer [-a] [-s] [-c] [-b min=N,max=N]
[-e ssf=N,id=ID] [-m MECHS] [-x AUXPROP_MECH] [-f FLAGS] [-p
PATH]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pluginviewer can be used by a server
administrator to troubleshoot SASL installations. The
utility can list loadable (properly configured) client and
server side plugins, as well as auxprop plugins.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a List auxprop plugins.</p>

<p>-s List server authentication (SASL) plugins.</p>

<p>-c List client authentication (SASL) plugins.</p>

<p>-b min=N1,max=N2 List client authentication (SASL)
plugins. Strength of the SASL security layer in bits. min=N1
specifies the minumum strength to use (1 =&gt; integrity
protection). max=N2 specifies the maximum strength to use.
Only SASL mechanisms which support security layer with
strength M such that N1 &lt;= M &lt;= N2 will be shown.</p>

<p>-e ssf=N,id=ID Assume that an external security layer
(e.g. TLS) with N-bit strength is installed. The ID is the
authentication identity used by the external security
layer.</p>

<p>-m MECHS Limit listed SASL plugins to the ones included
in the MECHS (space separated) list.</p>

<p>-x AUXPROP_MECHS Limit listed auxprop plugins to the one
listed in the AUX- PROP_MECHS (space separated) list.</p>

<p>-f FLAGS Set security flags. FLAGS is a comma separated
list of one or more of the following security flags: noplain
(SASL mechanism doesn&acute;t send password in the clear
during authentication), noac- tive (require protection from
active attacks), nodict (require mechanisms which are secure
against passive dictionary attacks), forwardsec (require
forward secrecy), passcred (require mecha- nisms that can
delegate client credentials), maximum (require all security
flags).</p>

<p>-p PATH Specifies a colon-separated search path for
plugins.</p>
