<p>FWRITE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FWRITE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fwrite - binary output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t fwrite(const void *restrict ptr, size_t size,
size_t nitems, FILE *restrict stream);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fwrite() function shall write, from the
array pointed to by ptr, up to nitems elements whose size is
specified by size, to the stream pointed to by stream. For
each object, size calls shall be made to the fputc()
function, taking the values (in order) from an array of
unsigned char exactly overlaying the object. The
file-position indica- tor for the stream (if defined) shall
be advanced by the number of bytes successfully written. If
an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position
indicator for the stream is unspecified.</p>

<p>The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file shall be
marked for update between the successful execution of
fwrite() and the next successful completion of a call to
fflush() or fclose() on the same stream, or a call to exit()
or abort().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The fwrite() function shall return the
number of elements successfully written, which may be less
than nitems if a write error is encountered. If size or
nitems is 0, fwrite() shall return 0 and the state of the
stream remains unchanged. Otherwise, if a write error
occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, and
errno shall be set to indi- cate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fputc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Because of possible differences in
element length and byte ordering, files written using
fwrite() are application-dependent, and possibly cannot be
read using fread() by a different application or by the same
application on a different processor.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
