<p>POSIX_MEMALIGN(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_MEMALIGN(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_memalign - aligned memory allocation
(ADVANCED REALTIME)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_memalign(void **memptr, size_t alignment,
size_t size);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_memalign() function shall allocate
size bytes aligned on a boundary specified by alignment, and
shall return a pointer to the allocated memory in memptr.
The value of alignment shall be a multiple of sizeof( void
*), that is also a power of two. Upon successful com-
pletion, the value pointed to by memptr shall be a multiple
of align- ment.</p>

<p>The free() function shall deallocate memory that has
previously been allocated by posix_memalign().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion,
posix_memalign() shall return zero; other- wise, an error
number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_memalign() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the alignment parameter is not a
power of two mul- tiple of sizeof( void *).</p>

<p>ENOMEM There is insufficient memory available with the
requested align- ment.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The posix_memalign() function is part
of the Advisory Information option and need not be provided
on all implementations.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
