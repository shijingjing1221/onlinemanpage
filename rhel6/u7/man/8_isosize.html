<p>NAME isosize - outputs the length of an iso9660 file
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS isosize [-x] [-d &lt;num&gt;]
&lt;iso9660_image_file&gt;...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command outputs the length of an
iso9660 file system that is con- tained in given file. That
file may be a normal file or a block device (e.g. /dev/hdd
or /dev/sr0). In the absence of any switches (or errors) it
will output the size of the iso9660 file system in bytes.
This can now be a large number (&gt;&gt; 4 GB).</p>

<p>-x output in humanly readable form the block count and
the block size. Output uses the term &quot;sectors&quot; for
&quot;blocks&quot;.</p>

<p>-d &lt;num&gt; only has affect when -x is not given. The
number output (if no errors) is the iso9660 file size in
bytes divided by &lt;num&gt;. So if &lt;num&gt; is the block
size then the output number will be the block count.</p>

<p>The size of the file (or block device) holding a iso9660
file system can be marginally larger than the actual size of
the iso9660 file sys- tem. One reason for this is that cd
writers are allowed to add &quot;run out&quot; sectors at
the end of a iso9660 image.</p>
