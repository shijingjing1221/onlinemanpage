<p>GREP(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GREP(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may

<p>NAME grep - search a file for a pattern</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS grep [-E| -F][-c| -l| -q][-insvx] -e
pattern_list... [-f pattern_file]...[file...]</p>

<p>grep [-E| -F][-c| -l| -q][-insvx][-e pattern_list]... -f
pattern_file...[file...]</p>

<p>grep [-E| -F][-c| -l| -q][-insvx]
pattern_list[file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The grep utility shall search the input
files, selecting lines matching one or more patterns; the
types of patterns are controlled by the options specified.
The patterns are specified by the -e option, -f option, or
the pattern_list operand. The pattern_lists value shall
consist of one or more patterns separated by
&lt;newline&gt;s; the pat- tern_file s contents shall
consist of one or more patterns terminated by
&lt;newline&gt;. By default, an input line shall be selected
if any pat- tern, treated as an entire basic regular
expression (BRE) as described in the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Regular
Expressions, matches any part of the line excluding the
terminating &lt;newline&gt;; a null BRE shall match every
line. By default, each selected input line shall be written
to the standard output.</p>

<p>Regular expression matching shall be based on text
lines. Since a &lt;new- line&gt; separates or terminates
patterns (see the -e and -f options below), regular
expressions cannot contain a &lt;newline&gt;. Similarly,
since patterns are matched against individual lines
(excluding the ter- minating &lt;newline&gt;s) of the input,
there is no way for a pattern to match a &lt;newline&gt;
found in the input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The grep utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-E Match using extended regular expressions. Treat each
pattern specified as an ERE, as described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.4,
Extended Regular Expres- sions. If any entire ERE pattern
matches some part of an input line excluding the terminating
&lt;newline&gt;, the line shall be matched. A null ERE shall
match every line.</p>

<p>-F Match using fixed strings. Treat each pattern
specified as a string instead of a regular expression. If an
input line con- tains any of the patterns as a contiguous
sequence of bytes, the line shall be matched. A null string
shall match every line.</p>

<p>-c Write only a count of selected lines to standard
output.</p>

<p>-e pattern_list</p>

<p>Specify one or more patterns to be used during the
search for input. The application shall ensure that patterns
in pat- tern_list are separated by a &lt;newline&gt;. A null
pattern can be specified by two adjacent &lt;newline&gt;s in
pattern_list. Unless the -E or -F option is also specified,
each pattern shall be treated as a BRE, as described in the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
9.3, Basic Regular Expressions. Multiple -e and -f options
shall be accepted by the grep util- ity. All of the
specified patterns shall be used when matching lines, but
the order of evaluation is unspecified.</p>

<p>-f pattern_file</p>

<p>Read one or more patterns from the file named by the
pathname pattern_file. Patterns in pattern_file shall be
terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;. A null pattern can be
specified by an empty line in pattern_file. Unless the -E or
-F option is also specified, each pattern shall be treated
as a BRE, as described in the Base Def- initions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3, Basic Reg- ular
Expressions.</p>

<p>-i Perform pattern matching in searches without regard
to case; see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 9.2, Regular Expression General
Requirements.</p>

<p>-l (The letter ell.) Write only the names of files
containing selected lines to standard output. Pathnames
shall be written once per file searched. If the standard
input is searched, a pathname of &quot;(standard
input)&quot; shall be written, in the POSIX locale. In other
locales, &quot;standard input&quot; may be replaced by
something more appropriate in those locales.</p>

<p>-n Precede each output line by its relative line number
in the file, each file starting at line 1. The line number
counter shall be reset for each file processed.</p>

<p>-q Quiet. Nothing shall be written to the standard
output, regard- less of matching lines. Exit with zero
status if an input line is selected.</p>

<p>-s Suppress the error messages ordinarily written for
nonexistent or unreadable files. Other error messages shall
not be sup- pressed.</p>

<p>-v Select lines not matching any of the specified
patterns. If the -v option is not specified, selected lines
shall be those that match any of the specified patterns.</p>

<p>-x Consider only input lines that use all characters in
the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; to match
an entire fixed string or regular expression to be matching
lines.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>pattern_list Specify one or more patterns to be used
during the search for input. This operand shall be treated
as if it were specified as -e pattern_list.</p>

<p>file A pathname of a file to be searched for the
patterns. If no file operands are specified, the standard
input shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied. See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of grep:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_COLLATE</p>

<p>Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files) and the behavior of character classes
within regular expres- sions.</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT If the -l option is in effect, and the -q option
is not, the following shall be written for each file
containing at least one selected input line:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>Otherwise, if more than one file argument appears, and
-q is not speci- fied, the grep utility shall prefix each
output line by:</p>

<p>&quot;%s:&quot;, &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p>The remainder of each output line shall depend on the
other options specified:</p>

<p>* If the -c option is in effect, the remainder of each
output line shall contain:</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;count&gt;</p>

<p>* Otherwise, if -c is not in effect and the -n option is
in effect, the following shall be written to standard
output:</p>

<p>&quot;%d:&quot;, &lt;line number&gt;</p>

<p>* Finally, the following shall be written to standard
output:</p>

<p>&quot;%s&quot;, &lt;selected-line contents&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 One or more lines were selected.</p>

<p>1 No lines were selected.</p>

<p>&gt;1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS If the -q option is specified,
the exit status shall be zero if an input line is selected,
even if an error was detected. Otherwise, default actions
shall be performed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Care should be taken when using
characters in pattern_list that may also be meaningful to
the command interpreter. It is safest to enclose the entire
pattern_list argument in single quotes:</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The -e pattern_list option has the same effect as the
pattern_list operand, but is useful when pattern_list begins
with the hyphen delim- iter. It is also useful when it is
more convenient to provide multiple patterns as separate
arguments.</p>

<p>Multiple -e and -f options are accepted and grep uses
all of the pat- terns it is given while matching input text
lines. (Note that the order of evaluation is not specified.
If an implementation finds a null string as a pattern, it is
allowed to use that pattern first, matching every line, and
effectively ignore any other patterns.)</p>

<p>The -q option provides a means of easily determining
whether or not a pattern (or string) exists in a group of
files. When searching several files, it provides a
performance improvement (because it can quit as soon as it
finds the first match) and requires less care by the user in
choosing the set of files to supply as arguments (because it
exits zero if it finds a match even if grep detected an
access or read error on earlier file operands).</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. To find all uses of the word
&quot;Posix&quot; (in any case) in file text.mm and write
with line numbers:</p>

<p>grep -i -n posix text.mm</p>

<p>2. To find all empty lines in the standard input:</p>

<p>grep ^$</p>

<p>or:</p>

<p>grep -v .</p>

<p>3. Both of the following commands print all lines
containing strings &quot;abc&quot; or &quot;def&quot; or
both:</p>

<p>grep -Eabc|def</p>

<p>grep -Fabc def</p>

<p>4. Both of the following commands print all lines
matching exactly &quot;abc&quot; or &quot;def&quot; :</p>

<p>grep -E^abc$|^def$</p>

<p>grep -F -xabc def</p>

<p>RATIONALE This grep has been enhanced in an
upwards-compatible way to provide the exact functionality of
the historical egrep and fgrep commands as well. It was the
clear intention of the standard developers to consolidate
the three greps into a single command.</p>

<p>The old egrep and fgrep commands are likely to be
supported for many years to come as implementation
extensions, allowing historical appli- cations to operate
unmodified.</p>

<p>Historical implementations usually silently ignored all
but one of mul- tiply-specified -e and -f options, but were
not consistent as to which specification was actually
used.</p>

<p>The -b option was omitted from the OPTIONS section
because block num- bers are implementation-defined.</p>

<p>The System V restriction on using - to mean standard
input was omitted.</p>

<p>A definition of action taken when given a null BRE or
ERE is specified. This is an error condition in some
historical implementations.</p>

<p>The -l option previously indicated that its use was
undefined when no files were explicitly named. This behavior
was historical and placed an unnecessary restriction on
future implementations. It has been removed.</p>

<p>The historical BSD grep -s option practice is easily
duplicated by redirecting standard output to /dev/null. The
-s option required here is from System V.</p>

<p>The -x option, historically available only with fgrep,
is available here for all of the non-obsolescent
versions.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
