<p>NAME ovf2ovp - convert a virtual font file and its
associated font metric file into property-list format</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ovf2ovp [ OPTION... ] OVFNAME[.ovf] [ [
OFMNAME[.ofm] ] [ OVPFILE[.ovp] ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ovf2ovp translates a virtual font (OVF)
file, OVFNAME, and its compan- ion font metric (OFM) file,
OFMNAME, into a human-readable property- list format. The
program writes to standard output (by default) or to a file
specified as OVPNAME.</p>

<p>The program also works with TeX VF and TFM files,
producing TeX VP files. (ovf2ovp is based on the WEB source
code for vftovp(1).)</p>

<p>OPTIONS -charcode-format=TYPE output character codes
according to TYPE, which can be either hex or ascii. Default
is hex. ascii specifes all ASCII letters and digits; hex
gets you everything else.</p>

<p>-help display a brief summary of syntax and options</p>

<p>-verbose display progress reports</p>

<p>-version output version information and exit</p>

<p>FILES OVPFILE Omega Virtual Property List file</p>

<p>OFMNAME Omega Font Metric file</p>

<p>OVFNAME Omega Virtual Font file</p>

<p>AUTHOR According to the WEB documentation:</p>

<p>VFtoVP is an extended version of the program TFtoPL,
which is part of the standard tex()ware library. The idea of
a virtual font was inspired by the work of David R. Fuchs
who designed a similar set of conventions in 1984 while
developing a device driver for ArborText, Inc. He wrote a
somewhat similar program called AMFtoXPL.</p>
