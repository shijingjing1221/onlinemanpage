<p>NAME init - Upstart process management daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS init [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION init is the parent of all processes on the
system, it is executed by the kernel and is responsible for
starting all other processes; it is the parent of all
processes whose natural parents have died and it is
responsible for reaping those when they die.</p>

<p>Processes managed by init are known as jobs and are
defined by files in the /etc/init directory. See init(5) for
more details on configuring Upstart.</p>

<p>Events init(8) is an event-based init daemon. This means
that jobs will be automatically started and stopped by
changes that occur to the system state, including as a
result of jobs starting and stopping.</p>

<p>This is different to dependency-based init daemons which
start a speci- fied set of goal jobs, and resolve the order
in which they should be started and other jobs required by
iterating their dependencies.</p>

<p>For more information on starting and stopping jobs, as
well as emitting events that will automatically start and
stop jobs, see the manual page for the initctl(8) tool.</p>

<p>The primary event is the startup(7) event, emitted when
the daemon has finished loading its configuration. Other
useful events are the start- ing(7), started(7), stopping(7)
and stopped(7) events emitted as jobs change state.</p>

<p>System V compatibility The Upstart init(8) daemon does
not keep track of runlevels itself, instead they are
implemented entirely by its userspace tools. The event
emitted to signify a change of runlevel is the runlevel(7)
event. For more information see its manual page.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Options are passed to init(8) by placing them on
the kernel command- line.</p>

<p>--verbose Outputs verbose messages about job state
changes and event emis- sions to the system console or log,
useful for debugging boot.</p>

<p>NOTES init is not normally executed by a user process,
and expects to have a process id of 1. If this is not the
case, it will actually execute telinit(8) and pass all
arguments to that. See that manual page for further
details.</p>
