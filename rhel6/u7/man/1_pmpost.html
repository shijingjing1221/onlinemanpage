<p>PMPOST(1) PMPOST(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmpost - append messages to the Performance
Co-Pilot notice board</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmpost message</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmpost will append the text message to the
end of the Performance Co- Pilot (PCP) notice board file
($PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES) in an atomic man- ner that guards
against corruption of the notice board file by concur- rent
invocations of pmpost.</p>

<p>The PCP notice board is intended to be a persistent
store and clearing house for important messages relating to
the operation of the PCP and the notification of performance
alerts from pmie(1) when other notifi- cation options are
either unavailable or unsuitable.</p>

<p>Before being written, messages are prefixed by the
current time, and when the current day is different to the
last time the notice board file was written, pmpost will
prepend the message with the full date.</p>

<p>If the notice board file does not exist, pmpost will
create it. pmpost would usually run from long-running PCP
daemons executing under the (typically unprivileged)
$PCP_USER and $PCP_GROUP accounts. The file should be owned
by root, and group writable by the $PCP_GROUP group.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES the PCP notice board file</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT The file /etc/pcp.conf contains the
local values for PCP_ variables.</p>
