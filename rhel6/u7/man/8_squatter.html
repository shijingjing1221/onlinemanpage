<p>NAME squatter - create SQUAT indexes for mailboxes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS squatter [ -C config-file ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -i
] [ -a ] [ -v ] mail- box...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Squatter creates a new SQUAT index for one
or more IMAP mailboxes. The SQUAT index is a unified index
of all of the header and body text of each message a given
mailbox. This index is used to significantly reduce IMAP
SEARCH times on a mailbox.</p>

<p>Squatter creates an index of ALL messages in the
mailbox, not just those since the last time that it was run
(i.e., it does NOT do incre- mental updates). Any messages
appended to the mailbox after squatter is run, will NOT be
included in the index. To include new messages in the index,
squatter must be run again. For large and active mailboxes,
it is recommended to run squatter periodically as an EVENT
in cyrus.conf(5)</p>

<p>NOTE: Messages and mailboxes that have not been indexed
CAN still be SEARCHed, just not as quickly as those with a
SQUAT index.</p>

<p>Squatter reads its configuration options out of the
imapd.conf(5) file unless specified otherwise by -C.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -C config-file Read configuration options from
config-file.</p>

<p>-r Recursively create indexes for all sub-mailboxes of
the mail- boxes or mailbox prefixes given as arguments.</p>

<p>-s Skip mailboxes whose index file is older than their
current squat file (within a small time delta).</p>

<p>-i Incremental updates where squat indexes already
exist.</p>

<p>-a Only create indexes for mailboxes which have the
shared /ven- dor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat annotation set to
&quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p>The value of the /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat
annotation is inherited by all children of the given
mailbox, so an entire mailbox tree can be indexed (or not
indexed) by setting a single annotation on the root of that
tree with a value of &quot;true&quot; (or
&quot;false&quot;). If a mailbox does not have a
/vendor/cmu/cyrus- imapd/squat annotation set on it (or does
not inherit one), then the mailbox is not indexed. In other
words, the implicit value of /vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/squat
is &quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p>-v Increase the verbosity of progress/status
messages.</p>
