<p>NAME ssh-copy-id - install your public key in a remote
machines autho- rized_keys</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ssh-copy-id [-i [identity_file]]
[user@]machine</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh to log
into a remote machine (presumably using a login password, so
password authentication should be enabled, unless youve done
some clever use of multiple identities) It also changes the
permissions of the remote users home, ~/.ssh, and
~/.ssh/authorized_keys to remove group writability (which
would other- wise prevent you from logging in, if the remote
sshd has StrictModes set in its configuration). If the -i
option is given then the identity file (defaults to
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) is used, regardless of whether there are
any keys in your ssh-agent. Otherwise, if this: ssh- add -L
provides any output, it uses that in preference to the
identity file. If the -i option is used, or the ssh-add
produced no output, then it uses the contents of the
identity file. Once it has one or more fingerprints (by
whatever means) it uses ssh to append them to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine (creating the
file, and directory, if necessary)</p>
