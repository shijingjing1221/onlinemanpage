<p>PAM_LASTLOG(8) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_LASTLOG(8)</p>

<p>NAME pam_lastlog - PAM module to display date of last
login and perform inactive account lock out</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_lastlog.so [debug] [silent] [never]
[nodate] [nohost] [noterm] [nowtmp] [noupdate] [showfailed]
[inactive=&lt;days&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a
line of information about the last login of the user. In
addition, the module maintains the /var/log/lastlog
file.</p>

<p>Some applications may perform this function themselves.
In such cases, this module is not necessary.</p>

<p>If the module is called in the auth or account phase,
the accounts that were not used recently enough will be
disallowed to log in. The check is not performed for the
root account so the root is never locked out.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Print debug information.</p>

<p>silent Don&acute;t inform the user about any previous
login, just update the /var/log/lastlog file.</p>

<p>never If the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any
old entries for the user, indicate that the user has never
previously logged in with a welcome message.</p>

<p>nodate Don&acute;t display the date of the last
login.</p>

<p>noterm Don&acute;t display the terminal name on which
the last login was attempted.</p>

<p>nohost Don&acute;t indicate from which host the last
login was attempted.</p>

<p>nowtmp Don&acute;t update the wtmp entry.</p>

<p>noupdate Don&acute;t update any file.</p>

<p>showfailed Display number of failed login attempts and
the date of the last failed attempt from btmp. The date is
not displayed when nodate is specified.</p>

<p>inactive=&lt;days&gt; This option is specific for the
auth or account phase. It specifies the number of days after
the last login of the user when the user will be locked out
by the module. The default value is 90.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED The auth and account module type
allows to lock out users which did not login recently
enough. The session module type is provided for displaying
the information about the last login and/or updating the
lastlog and wtmp files.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS Everything was successful.</p>

<p>PAM_SERVICE_ERR Internal service module error.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN User not known.</p>

<p>PAM_AUTH_ERR User locked out in the auth or account
phase due to inactivity.</p>

<p>PAM_IGNORE There was an error during reading the lastlog
file in the auth or account phase and thus inactivity of the
user cannot be determined.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to
display the last login time of an user:</p>

<p>session required pam_lastlog.so nowtmp</p>

<p>To reject the user if he did not login during the
previous 50 days the following line can be used:</p>

<p>auth required pam_lastlog.so inactive=50</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/lastlog Lastlog logging file</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pam.conf(5), pam.d(5), pam(8)</p>
