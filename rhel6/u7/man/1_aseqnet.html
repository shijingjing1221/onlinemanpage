<p>NAME aseqnet - ALSA sequencer connectors over
network</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS aseqnet [remotehost]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION aseqnet is an ALSA sequencer client which
sends and receives event packets over network. Suppose two
hosts connected by network, hostA as a server and hostB as a
client. The ALSA sequencer system must be run- ning on both
hosts. For creating the server port, run the following on
hostA:</p>

<p>hostA% aseqnet sequencer opened: 128:0</p>

<p>Then a user client 128 with port 0 was opened on hostA.
(The client number may vary.) For creating the
(network-)client port, run aseqnet with the hostname of the
server:</p>

<p>hostB% aseqnet hostA sequencer opened: 132:0</p>

<p>Now all events sent to hostA:128:0 are transferred to
hostB:132:0, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The ports created by aseqnet can be connected arbitrary
to other sequencer ports via aconnect(1). For example, to
connect hostB:132:0 to a MIDI output device 65:0:</p>

<p>hostB% aconnect 132:0 65:0</p>

<p>Then events to hostA:128:0 will be delivered to
hostB:65:0. The fol- lowing command plays MIDI on hostB.</p>

<p>hostA% pmidi -p 128:0 foo.mid</p>

<p>The multiple clients may exist simultaneously. If hostC
is connected as a client to hostA, events from from hostA
are sent to all connected network clients, i.e. hostB and
hostC. However, only one connection is allowed from a client
to a server.</p>

<p>To disconnect network, stop all clients before server by
ctrl-C or sending signal to them. The server will
automatically quit.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -p port Specify the TCP port number or TCP
service name.</p>

<p>-s addr Subscribe to the given address for read
automatically.</p>

<p>-d addr Subscribe to the given address for write
automatically.</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode.</p>
