<p>NAME git-reflog - Manage reflog information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git reflog &lt;subcommand&gt;
&lt;options&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The command takes various subcommands, and
different options depending on the subcommand:</p>

<p>git reflog expire [--dry-run] [--stale-fix] [--verbose]
[--expire=&lt;time&gt;] [--expire-unreachable=&lt;time&gt;]
[--all] &lt;refs&gt;... git reflog delete ref@{specifier}...
git reflog [show] [log-options] [&lt;ref&gt;]</p>

<p>Reflog is a mechanism to record when the tip of branches
are updated. This command is to manage the information
recorded in it.</p>

<p>The subcommand &quot;expire&quot; is used to prune older
reflog entries. Entries older than expire time, or entries
older than expire-unreachable time and not reachable from
the current tip, are removed from the reflog. This is
typically not used directly by the end users instead, see
git-gc(1).</p>

<p>The subcommand &quot;show&quot; (which is also the
default, in the absence of any subcommands) will take all
the normal log options, and show the log of the reference
provided in the command-line (or HEAD, by default). The
reflog will cover all recent actions (HEAD reflog records
branch switching as well). It is an alias for git log -g
--abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline; see git-log(1).</p>

<p>The reflog is useful in various git commands, to specify
the old value of a reference. For example, HEAD@{2} means
&quot;where HEAD used to be two moves ago&quot;,
master@{one.week.ago} means &quot;where master used to point
to one week ago&quot;, and so on. See git-rev-parse(1) for
more details.</p>

<p>To delete single entries from the reflog, use the
subcommand &quot;delete&quot; and specify the exact entry
(e.g. &quot;git reflog delete master@{2}&quot;).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --stale-fix This revamps the logic the
definition of &quot;broken commit&quot; becomes: a commit
that is not reachable from any of the refs and there is a
missing object among the commit, tree, or blob objects
reachable from it that is not reachable from any of the
refs.</p>

<p>This computation involves traversing all the reachable
objects, i.e. it has the same cost as git prune.
Fortunately, once this is run, we should not have to ever
worry about missing objects, because the current prune and
pack-objects know about reflogs and protect objects referred
by them.</p>

<p>--expire=&lt;time&gt; Entries older than this time are
pruned. Without the option it is taken from configuration
gc.reflogExpire, which in turn defaults to 90 days.</p>

<p>--expire-unreachable=&lt;time&gt; Entries older than
this time and not reachable from the current tip of the
branch are pruned. Without the option it is taken from
configuration gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, which in turn
defaults to 30 days.</p>

<p>--all Instead of listing &lt;refs&gt; explicitly, prune
all refs.</p>

<p>--updateref Update the ref with the sha1 of the top
reflog entry (i.e. &lt;ref&gt;@{0}) after expiring or
deleting.</p>

<p>--rewrite While expiring or deleting, adjust each reflog
entry to ensure that the old sha1 field points to the new
sha1 field of the previous entry.</p>

<p>--verbose Print extra information on screen.</p>
