<p>FWPRINTF(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual FWPRINTF(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME fwprintf, swprintf, wprintf - print formatted
wide-character output</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>int fwprintf(FILE *restrict stream, const wchar_t
*restrict format, ...); int swprintf(wchar_t *restrict ws,
size_t n, const wchar_t *restrict format, ...); int
wprintf(const wchar_t *restrict format, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fwprintf() function shall place output
on the named output stream. The wprintf() function shall
place output on the standard output stream stdout. The
swprintf() function shall place output followed by the null
wide character in consecutive wide characters starting at
*ws; no more than n wide characters shall be written,
including a terminating null wide character, which is always
added (unless n is zero).</p>

<p>Each of these functions shall convert, format, and print
its arguments under control of the format wide-character
string. The format is com- posed of zero or more directives:
ordinary wide-characters, which are simply copied to the
output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which
results in the fetching of zero or more arguments. The
results are undefined if there are insufficient arguments
for the format. If the format is exhausted while arguments
remain, the excess arguments are evaluated but are otherwise
ignored.</p>

<p>Conversions can be applied to the nth argument after the
format in the argument list, rather than to the next unused
argument. In this case, the conversion specifier wide
character % (see below) is replaced by the sequence
&quot;%n$&quot;, where n is a decimal integer in the range
[1,{NL_ARGMAX}], giving the position of the argument in the
argument list. This feature provides for the definition of
format wide-character strings that select arguments in an
order appropriate to specific lan- guages (see the EXAMPLES
section).</p>

<p>The format can contain either numbered argument
specifications (that is, &quot;%n$&quot; and
&quot;*m$&quot;), or unnumbered argument conversion
specifications (that is, % and * ), but not both. The only
exception to this is that %% can be mixed with the
&quot;%n$&quot; form. The results of mixing numbered and
unnumbered argument specifications in a format
wide-character string are undefined. When numbered argument
specifications are used, specify- ing the Nth argument
requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to
the (N-1)th, are specified in the format wide-character
string.</p>

<p>In format wide-character strings containing the
&quot;%n$&quot; form of conver- sion specification, numbered
arguments in the argument list can be ref- erenced from the
format wide-character string as many times as required.</p>

<p>In format wide-character strings containing the % form
of conversion specification, each argument in the argument
list shall be used exactly once.</p>

<p>All forms of the fwprintf() function allow for the
insertion of a locale-dependent radix character in the
output string, output as a wide-character value. The radix
character is defined in the programs locale (category
LC_NUMERIC ). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the
radix character is not defined, the radix character shall
default to a period (.).</p>

<p>Each conversion specification is introduced by the% wide
character or by the wide-character sequence &quot;%n$&quot;,
after which the following appear in sequence:</p>

<p>* Zero or more flags (in any order), which modify the
meaning of the conversion specification.</p>

<p>* An optional minimum field width. If the converted
value has fewer wide characters than the field width, it
shall be padded with spaces by default on the left; it shall
be padded on the right, if the left-adjustment flag (-),
described below, is given to the field width. The field
width takes the form of an asterisk (*), described below, or
a decimal integer.</p>

<p>* An optional precision that gives the minimum number of
digits to appear for the d, i, o, u, x, and X conversion
specifiers; the num- ber of digits to appear after the radix
character for the a, A, e, E, f, and F conversion
specifiers; the maximum number of significant digits for the
g and G conversion specifiers; or the maximum number of wide
characters to be printed from a string in the s conversion
specifiers. The precision takes the form of a period ( . )
fol- lowed either by an asterisk (*), described below, or an
optional decimal digit string, where a null digit string is
treated as 0. If a precision appears with any other
conversion wide character, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>* An optional length modifier that specifies the size of
the argument.</p>

<p>* A conversion specifier wide character that indicates
the type of conversion to be applied.</p>

<p>A field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated
by an asterisk ( *). In this case an argument of type int
supplies the field width or precision. Applications shall
ensure that arguments specifying field width, or precision,
or both appear in that order before the argument, if any, to
be converted. A negative field width is taken as a-flag
followed by a positive field width. A negative precision is
taken as if the precision were omitted. In format
wide-character strings contain- ing the &quot;%n$&quot; form
of a conversion specification, a field width or pre- cision
may be indicated by the sequence &quot;*m$&quot;, where m is
a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}] giving the
position in the argu- ment list (after the format argument)
of an integer argument containing the field width or
precision, for example:</p>

<p>wprintf(L&quot;%1$d:%2$.*3$d:%4$.*3$n&quot;, hour, min,
precision, sec);</p>

<p>The flag wide characters and their meanings are:</p>

<p>The integer portion of the result of a decimal
conversion ( %i, %d, %u, %f, %F, %g, or %G ) shall be
formatted with thousands grouping wide characters. For other
conversions, the behavior is undefined. The numeric grouping
wide character is used.</p>

<p>- The result of the conversion shall be left-justified
within the field. The conversion shall be right-justified if
this flag is not specified.</p>

<p>+ The result of a signed conversion shall always begin
with a sign (+or-). The conversion shall begin with a sign
only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not
specified.</p>

<p>&lt;space&gt; If the first wide character of a signed
conversion is not a sign, or if a signed conversion results
in no wide characters, a &lt;space&gt; shall be prefixed to
the result. This means that if the &lt;space&gt; and +flags
both appear, the &lt;space&gt; flag shall be ignored.</p>

<p># Specifies that the value is to be converted to an
alternative form. For o conversion, it increases the
precision (if neces- sary) to force the first digit of the
result to be 0. For x or X conversion specifiers, a non-zero
result shall have 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a, A, e, E,
f, F, g, and G conversion speci- fiers, the result shall
always contain a radix character, even if no digits follow
it. Without this flag, a radix character appears in the
result of these conversions only if a digit fol- lows it.
For g and G conversion specifiers, trailing zeros shall not
be removed from the result as they normally are. For other
conversion specifiers, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>0 For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G
conversion specifiers, leading zeros (following any
indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field
width; no space padding is performed. If the 0and-flags both
appear, the 0 flag shall be ignored. For d, i, o, u, x, and
X conversion speci- fiers, if a precision is specified, the
0 flag shall be ignored. If the0and &quot; flags both
appear, the grouping wide characters are inserted before
zero padding. For other conver- sions, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>The length modifiers and their meanings are:</p>

<p>hh Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a signed char or unsigned
char argument (the argument will have been promoted
according to the integer promo- tions, but its value shall
be converted to signed char or unsigned char before
printing); or that a following n conversion specifier
applies to a pointer to a signed char argument.</p>

<p>h Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a short or unsigned short
argument (the argument will have been promoted according to
the integer promotions, but its value shall be converted to
short or unsigned short before printing); or that a
following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
short argument.</p>

<p>l (ell) Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a long or unsigned long
argument; that a follow- ing n conversion specifier applies
to a pointer to a long argu- ment; that a following c
conversion specifier applies to a wint_t argument; that a
following s conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
wchar_t argument; or has no effect on a fol- lowing a, A, e,
E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier.</p>

<p>ll (ell-ell)</p>

<p>Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion specifier applies to a long long or unsigned long
long argument; or that a following n conversion specifier
applies to a pointer to a long long argument.</p>

<p>j Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to an intmax_t or uintmax_t
argument; or that a following n conversion specifier applies
to a pointer to an int- max_t argument.</p>

<p>z Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a size_t or the
corresponding signed integer type argument; or that a
following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a
signed integer type corresponding to a size_t argument.</p>

<p>t Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X
conversion speci- fier applies to a ptrdiff_t or the
corresponding unsigned type argument; or that a following n
conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a ptrdiff_t
argument.</p>

<p>L Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G
conversion specifier applies to a long double argument.</p>

<p>If a length modifier appears with any conversion
specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:</p>

<p>d, i The int argument shall be converted to a signed
decimal in the style &quot;[-]dddd&quot;. The precision
specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
value being converted can be repre- sented in fewer digits,
it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default
precision shall be 1. The result of converting zero with an
explicit precision of zero shall be no wide characters.</p>

<p>o The unsigned argument shall be converted to unsigned
octal for- mat in the style &quot;dddd&quot; . The precision
specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it
shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision
shall be 1. The result of convert- ing zero with an explicit
precision of zero shall be no wide characters.</p>

<p>u The unsigned argument shall be converted to unsigned
decimal format in the style &quot;dddd&quot; . The precision
specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it
shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default precision
shall be 1. The result of convert- ing zero with an explicit
precision of zero shall be no wide characters.</p>

<p>x The unsigned argument shall be converted to unsigned
hexadecimal format in the style &quot;dddd&quot; ; the
letters &quot;abcdef&quot; are used. The precision specifies
the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being
converted can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be
expanded with leading zeros. The default precision shall be
1. The result of converting zero with an explicit pre-
cision of zero shall be no wide characters.</p>

<p>X Equivalent to the x conversion specifier, except that
letters &quot;ABCDEF&quot; are used instead of
&quot;abcdef&quot; .</p>

<p>f, F The double argument shall be converted to decimal
notation in the style &quot;[-]ddd.ddd&quot;, where the
number of digits after the radix character shall be equal to
the precision specification. If the precision is missing, it
shall be taken as 6; if the pre- cision is explicitly zero
and no#flag is present, no radix character shall appear. If
a radix character appears, at least one digit shall appear
before it. The value shall be rounded in an
implementation-defined manner to the appropriate number of
digits.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity shall be
converted in one of the styles &quot;[-]inf&quot; or
&quot;[-]infinity&quot; ; which style is implementation-
defined. A double argument representing a NaN shall be
converted in one of the styles &quot;[-]nan&quot; or
&quot;[-]nan(n-char-sequence)&quot;; which style, and the
meaning of any n-char-sequence, is implementation-defined.
The F conversion specifier produces &quot;INF&quot;,
&quot;INFINITY&quot;, or &quot;NAN&quot; instead of
&quot;inf&quot;, &quot;infinity&quot;, or &quot;nan&quot;,
respectively.</p>

<p>e, E The double argument shall be converted in the style
&quot;[-]d.ddde&plusmn;dd&quot;, where there shall be one
digit before the radix character (which is non-zero if the
argument is non-zero) and the number of digits after it
shall be equal to the precision; if the precision is
missing, it shall be taken as 6; if the pre- cision is zero
and no#flag is present, no radix character shall appear. The
value shall be rounded in an implementation- defined manner
to the appropriate number of digits. The E con- version wide
character shall produce a number withEinstead of e
introducing the exponent. The exponent shall always con-
tain at least two digits. If the value is zero, the exponent
shall be zero.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
be converted in the style of an f or F conversion
specifier.</p>

<p>g, G The double argument shall be converted in the style
f or e (or in the style F or E in the case of a G conversion
specifier), with the precision specifying the number of
significant digits. If an explicit precision is zero, it
shall be taken as 1. The style used depends on the value
converted; style e (or E ) shall be used only if the
exponent resulting from such a conversion is less than -4 or
greater than or equal to the precision. Trailing zeros shall
be removed from the fractional portion of the result; a
radix character shall appear only if it is followed by a
digit.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
be converted in the style of an f or F conversion
specifier.</p>

<p>a, A A double argument representing a floating-point
number shall be converted in the style
&quot;[-]0xh.hhhhp&plusmn;d&quot;, where there shall be one
hexadecimal digit (which is non-zero if the argument is a
normalized floating-point number and is otherwise
unspecified) before the decimal-point wide character and the
number of hex- adecimal digits after it shall be equal to
the precision; if the precision is missing and FLT_RADIX is
a power of 2, then the precision shall be sufficient for an
exact representation of the value; if the precision is
missing and FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the
precision shall be sufficient to distinguish val- ues of
type double, except that trailing zeros may be omitted; if
the precision is zero and the #flag is not specified, no
decimal-point wide character shall appear. The letters
&quot;abcdef&quot; are used for a conversion and the letters
&quot;ABCDEF&quot; for A conver- sion. The A conversion
specifier produces a number withXand P instead of x andp.
The exponent shall always contain at least one digit, and
only as many more digits as necessary to represent the
decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent
shall be zero.</p>

<p>A double argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
be converted in the style of an f or F conversion
specifier.</p>

<p>c If no l (ell) qualifier is present, the int argument
shall be converted to a wide character as if by calling the
btowc() function and the resulting wide character shall be
written. Oth- erwise, the wint_t argument shall be converted
to wchar_t, and written.</p>

<p>s If no l (ell) qualifier is present, the application
shall ensure that the argument is a pointer to a character
array containing a character sequence beginning in the
initial shift state. Char- acters from the array shall be
converted as if by repeated calls to the mbrtowc() function,
with the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
initialized to zero before the first character is converted,
and written up to (but not including) the terminating null
wide character. If the precision is speci- fied, no more
than that many wide characters shall be written. If the
precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of
the array, the application shall ensure that the array con-
tains a null wide character.</p>

<p>If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the application
shall ensure that the argument is a pointer to an array of
type wchar_t. Wide characters from the array shall be
written up to (but not including) a terminating null wide
character. If no precision is specified, or is greater than
the size of the array, the application shall ensure that the
array con- tains a null wide character. If a precision is
specified, no more than that many wide characters shall be
written.</p>

<p>p The application shall ensure that the argument is a
pointer to void. The value of the pointer shall be converted
to a sequence of printable wide characters in an
implementation-defined man- ner.</p>

<p>n The application shall ensure that the argument is a
pointer to an integer into which is written the number of
wide characters written to the output so far by this call to
one of the fwprintf() functions. No argument shall be
converted, but one shall be consumed. If the conversion
specification includes any flags, a field width, or a
precision, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>C Equivalent to lc .</p>

<p>S Equivalent to ls .</p>

<p>% Output a %wide character; no argument shall be
converted. The entire conversion specification shall be %%
.</p>

<p>If a conversion specification does not match one of the
above forms, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause
truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is
wider than the field width, the field shall be expanded to
contain the conversion result. Charac- ters generated by
fwprintf() and wprintf() shall be printed as if fputwc() had
been called.</p>

<p>For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is not a power of
2 and the result is not exactly representable in the given
precision, the result should be one of the two adjacent
numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given
precision, with the extra stipulation that the error should
have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.</p>

<p>For e, E, f, F, g, and G conversion specifiers, if the
number of sig- nificant decimal digits is at most
DECIMAL_DIG, then the result should be correctly rounded. If
the number of significant decimal digits is more than
DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is exactly representable
with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result should be an exact
representa- tion with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the source
value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings L &lt; U,
both having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits; the value of the
resultant decimal string D should satisfy L &lt;= D &lt;= U,
with the extra stipulation that the error should have a
correct sign for the current rounding direction.</p>

<p>The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the file shall be
marked for update between the call to a successful execution
of fwprintf() or wprintf() and the next successful
completion of a call to fflush() or fclose() on the same
stream, or a call to exit() or abort().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, these functions
shall return the number of wide characters transmitted,
excluding the terminating null wide char- acter in the case
of swprintf(), or a negative value if an output error was
encountered, and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>If n or more wide characters were requested to be
written, swprintf() shall return a negative value, and set
errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS For the conditions under which fwprintf() and
wprintf() fail and may fail, refer to fputwc().</p>

<p>In addition, all forms of fwprintf() may fail if:</p>

<p>EILSEQ A wide-character code that does not correspond to
a valid char- acter has been detected.</p>

<p>EINVAL There are insufficient arguments.</p>

<p>In addition, wprintf() and fwprintf() may fail if:</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To print the language-independent date and time
format, the following statement could be used:</p>

<p>wprintf(format, weekday, month, day, hour, min);</p>

<p>For American usage, format could be a pointer to the
wide-character string:</p>

<p>L&quot;%s, %s %d, %d:%.2n&quot;</p>

<p>producing the message:</p>

<p>Sunday, July 3, 10:02</p>

<p>whereas for German usage, format could be a pointer to
the wide-charac- ter string:</p>

<p>L&quot;%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2n&quot;</p>

<p>producing the message:</p>

<p>Sonntag, 3. Juli, 10:02</p>
