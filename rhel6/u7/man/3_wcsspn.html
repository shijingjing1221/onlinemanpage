<p>NAME wcsspn - advance in a wide-character string,
skipping any of a set of wide characters</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>size_t wcsspn(const wchar_t *wcs, const wchar_t
*accept);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcsspn() function is the wide-character
equivalent of the strspn(3) function. It determines the
length of the longest initial segment of wcs which consists
entirely of wide-characters listed in accept. In other
words, it searches for the first occurrence in the
wide-character string wcs of a wide-character not contained
in the wide-character string accept.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The wcsspn() function returns the number of
wide characters in the longest initial segment of wcs which
consists entirely of wide-charac- ters listed in accept. In
other words, it returns the position of the first occurrence
in the wide-character string wcs of a wide-character not
contained in the wide-character string accept, or
wcslen(wcs) if there is none.</p>
