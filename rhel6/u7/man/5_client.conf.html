<p>NAME client.conf - client configuration file for
cups</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The client.conf file configures the CUPS
client and is normally located in the /etc/cups or ~/.cups
directory. Each line in the file can be a configuration
directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start
with the # character.</p>

<p>DIRECTIVES The following directives are understood by
the client. Consult the on- line help for detailed
descriptions:</p>

<p>Encryption IfRequested</p>

<p>Encryption Never</p>

<p>Encryption Required Specifies the level of encryption
that is required for a particu- lar location.</p>

<p>ServerName hostname-or-ip-address[:port]</p>

<p>ServerName /domain/socket Specifies the address and
optionally the port to use when connect- ing to the server
.TP 5 SSLOptions [AllowRC4] [Allow SSL3] Sets SSL/TLS
protocol options for encrypted connections. By default, CUPS
only supports encryption using TLS v1.0 or higher using
known secure cipher suites. The AllowRC4 option enables the
128-bit RC4 cipher suites, which are required for some older
clients that do not implement newer ones. The AllowSSL3
option enables SSL v3.0, which is required for some older
clients that do not support TLS v1.0.</p>
