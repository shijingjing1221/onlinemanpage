<p>QUERY_MODULE(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
QUERY_MODULE(2)</p>

<p>NAME query_module - query the kernel for various bits
pertaining to modules</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;</p>

<p>int query_module(const char *name, int which, void *buf,
size_t bufsize, size_t *ret);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION query_module() requests information from the
kernel about loadable mod- ules. The returned information is
placed in the buffer pointed to by buf. The caller must
specify the size of buf in bufsize. The precise nature and
format of the returned information depend on the operation
specified by which. Some operations require name to identify
a cur- rently loaded module, some allow name to be NULL,
indicating the kernel proper.</p>

<p>The following values can be specified for which:</p>

<p>0 Returns success, if the kernel supports
query_module(). Used to probe for availability of the system
call.</p>

<p>QM_MODULES Returns the names of all loaded modules. The
returned buffer consists of a sequence of null-terminated
strings; ret is set to the number of modules.</p>

<p>QM_DEPS Returns the names of all modules used by the
indicated module. The returned buffer consists of a sequence
of null-terminated strings; ret is set to the number of
modules.</p>

<p>QM_REFS Returns the names of all modules using the
indicated module. This is the inverse of QM_DEPS. The
returned buffer consists of a sequence of null-terminated
strings; ret is set to the number of modules.</p>

<p>QM_SYMBOLS Returns the symbols and values exported by
the kernel or the indicated module. The returned buffer is
an array of structures of the following form</p>

<p>struct module_symbol { unsigned long value; unsigned
long name; };</p>

<p>followed by null-terminated strings. The value of name
is the character offset of the string relative to the start
of buf; ret is set to the number of symbols.</p>

<p>QM_INFO Returns miscellaneous information about the
indicated module. The output buffer format is:</p>

<p>struct module_info { unsigned long address; unsigned
long size; unsigned long flags; };</p>

<p>where address is the kernel address at which the module
resides, size is the size of the module in bytes, and flags
is a mask of MOD_RUNNING, MOD_AUTOCLEAN, etc. that indicates
the current sta- tus of the module (see the kernel source
file include/linux/mod- ule.h). ret is set to the size of
the module_info structure.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EFAULT At least one of name, buf, or ret was
outside the programs accessible address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL Invalid which; or name is NULL (indicating
&quot;the kernel&quot;), but this is not permitted with the
specified value of which.</p>

<p>ENOENT No module by that name exists.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The buffer size provided was too small. ret is
set to the mini- mum size needed.</p>

<p>ENOSYS query_module() is not supported in this version
of the kernel.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO query_module() is Linux-specific.</p>

<p>NOTES This system call is only present on Linux up until
kernel 2.4; it was removed in Linux 2.6. Some of the
information that was available via query_module() can be
obtained from /proc/modules, /proc/kallsyms, and
/sys/modules.</p>
