<p>NAME refer - preprocess bibliographic references for
groff</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS refer [ -benvCPRS ] [ -an ] [ -cfields ] [ -fn
] [ -ifields ] [ -kfield ] [ -lm,n ] [ -pfilename ] [
-sfields ] [ -tn ] [ -Bfield.macro ] [ filename... ]</p>

<p>It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This file documents the GNU version of
refer, which is part of the groff document formatting
system. refer copies the contents of file- name... to the
standard output, except that lines between .[ and .] are
interpreted as citations, and lines between .R1 and .R2 are
inter- preted as commands about how citations are to be
processed.</p>

<p>Each citation specifies a reference. The citation can
specify a refer- ence that is contained in a bibliographic
database by giving a set of keywords that only that
reference contains. Alternatively it can spec- ify a
reference by supplying a database record in the citation. A
com- bination of these alternatives is also possible.</p>

<p>For each citation, refer can produce a mark in the text.
This mark consists of some label which can be separated from
the text and from other labels in various ways. For each
reference it also outputs groff commands that can be used by
a macro package to produce a formatted reference for each
citation. The output of refer must therefore be processed
using a suitable macro package. The -ms and -me macros are
both suitable. The commands to format a citation s reference
can be output immediately after the citation, or the
references may be accumu- lated, and the commands output at
some later point. If the references are accumulated, then
multiple citations of the same reference will produce a
single formatted reference.</p>

<p>The interpretation of lines between .R1 and .R2 as
commands is a new feature of GNU refer. Documents making use
of this feature can still be processed by Unix refer just by
adding the lines</p>

<p>.de R1 .ig R2 .. to the beginning of the document. This
will cause troff to ignore everything between .R1 and .R2.
The effect of some commands can also be achieved by options.
These options are supported mainly for compat- ibility with
Unix refer. It is usually more convenient to use com-
mands.</p>

<p>refer generates .lf lines so that filenames and line
numbers in mes- sages produced by commands that read refer
output will be correct; it also interprets lines beginning
with .lf so that filenames and line numbers in the messages
and .lf lines that it produces will be accurate even if the
input has been preprocessed by a command such as
soelim(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most options are equivalent to commands (for a
description of these commands see the Commands
subsection):</p>

<p>-b no-label-in-text; no-label-in-reference</p>

<p>-e accumulate</p>

<p>-n no-default-database</p>

<p>-C compatible</p>

<p>-P move-punctuation</p>

<p>-S label &quot;(A.n|Q), (D.y|D)&quot;; bracket-label
&quot; (&quot; ) &quot;; &quot;</p>

<p>-an reverse An</p>

<p>-cfields capitalize fields</p>

<p>-fn label %n</p>

<p>-ifields search-ignore fields</p>

<p>-k label %a</p>

<p>-kfield label fiel%a</p>

<p>-l label A.nD.y%a</p>

<p>-lm label A.n+mD.y%a</p>

<p>-l,n label A.nD.y-n%a</p>

<p>-lm,n label A.n+mD.y-n%a</p>

<p>-pfilename database filename</p>

<p>-sspec sort spec</p>

<p>-tn search-truncate n</p>

<p>These options are equivalent to the following commands
with the addi- tion that the filenames specified on the
command line are processed as if they were arguments to the
bibliography command instead of in the normal way:</p>

<p>-B annotate X AP; no-label-in-reference</p>

<p>-Bfield.macro annotate field macro;
no-label-in-reference</p>

<p>The following options have no equivalent commands:</p>

<p>-v Print the version number.</p>

<p>-R Dont recognize lines beginning with .R1/.R2.</p>

<p>USAGE Bibliographic databases The bibliographic database
is a text file consisting of records sepa- rated by one or
more blank lines. Within each record fields start with a %
at the beginning of a line. Each field has a one character
name that immediately follows the %. It is best to use only
upper and lower case letters for the names of fields. The
name of the field should be followed by exactly one space,
and then by the contents of the field. Empty fields are
ignored. The conventional meaning of each field is as
follows:</p>

<p>A The name of an author. If the name contains a title
such as Jr. at the end, it should be separated from the last
name by a comma. There can be multiple occurrences of the A
field. The order is significant. It is a good idea always to
supply an A field or a Q field.</p>

<p>B For an article that is part of a book, the title of
the book</p>

<p>C The place (city) of publication.</p>

<p>D The date of publication. The year should be specified
in full. If the month is specified, the name rather than the
number of the month should be used, but only the first three
letters are required. It is a good idea always to supply a D
field; if the date is unknown, a value such as in press or
unknown can be used.</p>

<p>E For an article that is part of a book, the name of an
editor of the book. Where the work has editors and no
authors, the names of the editors should be given as A
fields and , (ed) or , (eds) should be appended to the last
author.</p>

<p>G US Government ordering number.</p>

<p>I The publisher (issuer).</p>

<p>J For an article in a journal, the name of the
journal.</p>

<p>K Keywords to be used for searching.</p>

<p>L Label.</p>

<p>N Journal issue number.</p>

<p>O Other information. This is usually printed at the end
of the reference.</p>

<p>P Page number. A range of pages can be specified as
m-n.</p>

<p>Q The name of the author, if the author is not a person.
This will only be used if there are no A fields. There can
only be one Q field.</p>

<p>R Technical report number.</p>

<p>S Series name.</p>

<p>T Title. For an article in a book or journal, this
should be the title of the article.</p>

<p>V Volume number of the journal or book.</p>

<p>X Annotation.</p>

<p>For all fields except A and E, if there is more than one
occurrence of a particular field in a record, only the last
such field will be used.</p>

<p>If accent strings are used, they should follow the
character to be accented. This means that the AM macro must
be used with the -ms macros. Accent strings should not be
quoted: use one rather than two.</p>

<p>Citations The format of a citation is .[opening-text
flags keywords fields .]closing-text</p>

<p>The opening-text, closing-text and flags components are
optional. Only one of the keywords and fields components
need be specified.</p>

<p>The keywords component says to search the bibliographic
databases for a reference that contains all the words in
keywords. It is an error if more than one reference if
found.</p>

<p>The fields components specifies additional fields to
replace or supple- ment those specified in the reference.
When references are being accu- mulated and the keywords
component is non-empty, then additional fields should be
specified only on the first occasion that a particular
refer- ence is cited, and will apply to all citations of
that reference.</p>

<p>The opening-text and closing-text component specifies
strings to be used to bracket the label instead of the
strings specified in the bracket-label command. If either of
these components is non-empty, the strings specified in the
bracket-label command will not be used; this behaviour can
be altered using the [ and ] flags. Note that leading and
trailing spaces are significant for these components.</p>

<p>The flags component is a list of non-alphanumeric
characters each of which modifies the treatment of this
particular citation. Unix refer will treat these flags as
part of the keywords and so will ignore them since they are
non-alphanumeric. The following flags are currently
recognized:</p>

<p># This says to use the label specified by the
short-label command, instead of that specified by the label
command. If no short label has been specified, the normal
label will be used. Typi- cally the short label is used with
author-date labels and con- sists of only the date and
possibly a disambiguating letter; the # is supposed to be
suggestive of a numeric type of label.</p>

<p>[ Precede opening-text with the first string specified
in the bracket-label command.</p>

<p>] Follow closing-text with the second string specified
in the bracket-label command.</p>

<p>One advantages of using the [ and ] flags rather than
including the brackets in opening-text and closing-text is
that you can change the style of bracket used in the
document just by changing the bracket- label command.
Another advantage is that sorting and merging of cita- tions
will not necessarily be inhibited if the flags are used.</p>

<p>If a label is to be inserted into the text, it will be
attached to the line preceding the .[ line. If there is no
such line, then an extra line will be inserted before the .[
line and a warning will be given.</p>

<p>There is no special notation for making a citation to
multiple refer- ences. Just use a sequence of citations, one
for each reference. Dont put anything between the citations.
The labels for all the cita- tions will be attached to the
line preceding the first citation. The labels may also be
sorted or merged. See the description of the &lt;&gt; label
expression, and of the sort-adjacent-labels and
abbreviate-label- ranges command. A label will not be merged
if its citation has a non- empty opening-text or
closing-text. However, the labels for a citation using the ]
flag and without any closing-text immediately followed by a
citation using the [ flag and without any opening-text may
be sorted and merged even though the first citations
opening-text or the second citation s closing-text is
non-empty. (If you wish to prevent this just make the first
citations closing-tex&amp;.)</p>

<p>Commands Commands are contained between lines starting
with .R1 and .R2. Recog- nition of these lines can be
prevented by the -R option. When a .R1 line is recognized
any accumulated references are flushed out. Neither .R1 nor
.R2 lines, nor anything between them is output.</p>

<p>Commands are separated by newlines or ;s. # introduces a
comment that extends to the end of the line (but does not
conceal the newline). Each command is broken up into words.
Words are separated by spaces or tabs. A word that begins
with &quot; extends to the next &quot; that is not fol-
lowed by another &quot;. If there is no such &quot; the word
extends to the end of the line. Pairs of &quot; in a word
beginning with &quot; collapse to a sin- gle &quot;. Neither
# nor ; are recognized inside &quot;s. A line can be con-
tinued by ending it with; this works everywhere except after
a #.</p>

<p>Each command name that is marked with * has an
associated negative com- mand no-name that undoes the effect
of name. For example, the no-sort command specifies that
references should not be sorted. The negative commands take
no arguments.</p>

<p>In the following description each argument must be a
single word; field is used for a single upper or lower case
letter naming a field; fields is used for a sequence of such
letters; m and n are used for a non-neg- ative numbers;
string is used for an arbitrary string; filename is used for
the name of a file.</p>

<p>abbreviate* fields string1 string2 string3 string4
Abbreviate the first names of fields. An ini- tial letter
will be separated from another initial letter by string1,
from the last name by string2, and from anything else (such
as a von or de) by string3. These default to a period
followed by a space. In a hyphenated first name, the initial
of the first part of the name will be separated from the
hyphen by string4; this defaults to a period. No attempt is
made to handle any ambiguities that might result from
abbreviation. Names are abbreviated before sorting and
before label construction.</p>

<p>abbreviate-label-ranges* string Three or more adjacent
labels that refer to consecutive references will be
abbreviated to a label consisting of the first label, fol-
lowed by string followed by the last label. This is mainly
useful with numeric labels. If string is omitted it defaults
to -.</p>

<p>accumulate* Accumulate references instead of writing out
each reference as it is encountered. Accumu- lated
references will be written out whenever a reference of the
form</p>

<p>.[ $LIST$ .]</p>

<p>is encountered, after all input files hve been
processed, and whenever .R1 line is recog- nized.</p>

<p>annotate* field string field is an annotation; print it
at the end of the reference as a paragraph preceded by the
line</p>

<p>.string</p>

<p>If macro is omitted it will default to AP; if field is
also omitted it will default to X. Only one field can be an
annotation.</p>

<p>articles string... string... are definite or indefinite
arti- cles, and should be ignored at the beginning of T
fields when sorting. Initially, the, a and an are recognized
as articles.</p>

<p>bibliography filename... Write out all the references
contained in the bibliographic databases filename...</p>

<p>bracket-label string1 string2 string3 In the text,
bracket each label with string1 and string2. An occurrence
of string2 immedi- ately followed by string1 will be turned
into string3. The default behaviour is</p>

<p>bracket-label*([.*(.] &quot;, &quot;</p>

<p>capitalize fields Convert fields to caps and small
caps.</p>

<p>compatible* Recognize .R1 and .R2 even when followed by
a character other than space or newline.</p>

<p>database filename... Search the bibliographic databases
filename... For each filename if an index filename.i cre-
ated by indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead;
each index can cover multi- ple databases.</p>

<p>date-as-label* string string is a label expression that
specifies a string with which to replace the D field after
constructing the label. See the Label expres- sions
subsection for a description of label expressions. This
command is useful if you do not want explicit labels in the
reference list, but instead want to handle any necessary
disambiguation by qualifying the date in some way. The label
used in the text would typi- cally be some combination of
the author and date. In most cases you should also use the
no-label-in-reference command. For example,</p>

<p>date-as-label D.+yD.y%a*D.-y</p>

<p>would attach a disambiguating letter to the year part of
the D field in the reference.</p>

<p>default-database* The default database should be
searched. This is the default behaviour, so the negative
ver- sion of this command is more useful. refer determines
whether the default database should be searched on the first
occasion that it needs to do a search. Thus a no-default-
database command must be given before then, in order to be
effective.</p>

<p>discard* fields When the reference is read, fields
should be discarded; no string definitions for fields will
be output. Initially, fields are XYZ.</p>

<p>et-al* string m n Control use of et al in the evaluation
of @ expressions in label expressions. If the num- ber of
authors needed to make the author sequence unambiguous is u
and the total number of authors is t then the last t-u
authors will be replaced by string provided that t-u is not
less than m and t is not less than n. The default behaviour
is</p>

<p>et-al &quot; et al&quot; 2 3</p>

<p>include filename Include filename and interpret the
contents as commands.</p>

<p>join-authors string1 string2 string3 This says how
authors should be joined together. When there are exactly
two authors, they will be joined with string1. When there
are more than two authors, all but the last two will be
joined with string2, and the last two authors will be joined
with string3. If string3 is omitted, it will default to
string1; if string2 is also omitted it will also default to
string1. For example,</p>

<p>join-authors &quot; and &quot; &quot;, &quot; &quot;,
and &quot;</p>

<p>will restore the default method for joining authors.</p>

<p>label-in-reference* When outputting the reference,
define the string [F to be the references label. This is the
default behaviour; so the negative ver- sion of this command
is more useful.</p>

<p>label-in-text* For each reference output a label in the
text. The label will be separated from the surround- ing
text as described in the bracket-label command. This is the
default behaviour; so the negative version of this command
is more useful.</p>

<p>label string string is a label expression describing how
to label each reference.</p>

<p>separate-label-second-parts string When merging two-part
labels, separate the second part of the second label from
the first label with string. See the description of the
&lt;&gt; label expression.</p>

<p>move-punctuation* In the text, move any punctuation at
the end of line past the label. It is usually a good idea to
give this command unless you are using superscripted numbers
as labels.</p>

<p>reverse* string Reverse the fields whose names are in
string. Each field name can be followed by a number which
says how many such fields should be reversed. If no number
is given for a field, all such fields will be reversed.</p>

<p>search-ignore* fields While searching for keys in
databases for which no index exists, ignore the contents of
fields. Initially, fields XYZ are ignored.</p>

<p>search-truncate* n Only require the first n characters
of keys to be given. In effect when searching for a given
key words in the database are truncated to the maximum of n
and the length of the key. Initially n is 6.</p>

<p>short-label* string string is a label expression that
specifies an alternative (usually shorter) style of label.
This is used when the # flag is given in the citation. When
using author-date style labels, the identity of the author
or authors is sometimes clear from the context, and so it
may be desirable to omit the author or authors from the
label. The short-label command will typically be used to
specify a label contain- ing just a date and possibly a
disambiguating letter.</p>

<p>sort* string Sort references according to string. Refer-
ences will automatically be accumulated. string should be a
list of field names, each followed by a number, indicating
how many fields with the name should be used for sort- ing.
+ can be used to indicate that all the fields with the name
should be used. Also . can be used to indicate the
references should be sorted using the (tentative) label.
(The Label expressions subsection describes the concept of a
tentative label.)</p>

<p>sort-adjacent-labels* Sort labels that are adjacent in
the text according to their position in the reference list.
This command should usually be given if the
abbreviate-label-ranges command has been given, or if the
label expression contains a &lt;&gt; expression. This will
have no effect unless references are being accumulated.</p>

<p>Label expressions Label expressions can be evaluated
both normally and tentatively. The result of normal
evaluation is used for output. The result of tenta- tive
evaluation, called the tentative label, is used to gather
the information that normal evaluation needs to disambiguate
the label. Label expressions specified by the date-as-label
and short-label com- mands are not evaluated tentatively.
Normal and tentative evaluation are the same for all types
of expression other than @, *, and % expres- sions. The
description below applies to normal evaluation, except where
otherwise specified.</p>

<p>field field n The n-th part of field. If n is omitted,
it defaults to 1.</p>

<p>string The characters in string literally.</p>

<p>@ All the authors joined as specified by the
join-authors command. The whole of each author s name will
be used. However, if the references are sorted by author
(that is the sort specification starts with A+), then
authors last names will be used instead, provided that this
does not introduce ambiguity, and also an initial
subsequence of the authors may be used instead of all the
authors, again provided that this does not introduce ambigu-
ity. The use of only the last name for the i-th author of
some reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is
some other reference, such that the first i-1 authors of the
references are the same, the i-th authors are not the same,
but the i-th authors last names are the same. A proper
initial subsequence of the sequence of authors for some
reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is a
reference with some other sequence of authors which also has
that subsequence as a proper initial sub- sequence. When an
initial subsequence of authors is used, the remaining
authors are replaced by the string specified by the et-al
command; this command may also specify additional require-
ments that must be met before an initial subsequence can be
used. @ tentatively evaluates to a canonical representation
of the authors, such that authors that compare equally for
sorting purpose will have the same representation.</p>

<p>%n %a %A %i %I The serial number of the reference
formatted according to the character following the %. The
serial number of a reference is 1 plus the number of earlier
references with same tentative label as this reference.
These expressions tentatively evaluate to an empty
string.</p>

<p>expr* If there is another reference with the same
tentative label as this reference, then expr, otherwise an
empty string. It tenta- tively evaluates to an empty
string.</p>

<p>expr+n expr-n The first (+) or last (-) n upper or lower
case letters or dig- its of expr. Troff special characters
(such asa) count as a single letter. Accent strings are
retained but do not count towards the total.</p>

<p>expr.l expr converted to lowercase.</p>

<p>expr.u expr converted to uppercase.</p>

<p>expr.c expr converted to caps and small caps.</p>

<p>expr.r expr reversed so that the last name is first.</p>

<p>expr.a expr with first names abbreviated. Note that
fields specified in the abbreviate command are abbreviated
before any labels are evaluated. Thus .a is useful only when
you want a field to be abbreviated in a label but not in a
reference.</p>

<p>expr.y The year part of expr.</p>

<p>expr.+y The part of expr before the year, or the whole
of expr if it does not contain a year.</p>

<p>expr.-y The part of expr after the year, or an empty
string if expr does not contain a year.</p>

<p>expr.n The last name part of expr.</p>

<p>exprexpr2 expr1 except that if the last character of
expr1 is - then it will be replaced by expr2.</p>

<p>expr1 expr2 The concatenation of expr1 and expr2.</p>

<p>expr1|expr2 If expr1 is non-empty then expr1 otherwise
expr2.</p>

<p>expr1&amp;expr2 If expr1 is non-empty then expr2
otherwise an empty string.</p>

<p>expr1?expr2:expr3 If expr1 is non-empty then expr2
otherwise expr3.</p>

<p>&lt;expr&gt; The label is in two parts, which are
separated by expr. Two adjacent two-part labels which have
the same first part will be merged by appending the second
part of the second label onto the first label separated by
the string specified in the separate- label-second-parts
command (initially, a comma followed by a space); the
resulting label will also be a two-part label with the same
first part as before merging, and so additional labels can
be merged into it. Note that it is permissible for the first
part to be empty; this maybe desirable for expressions used
in the short-label command.</p>

<p>(expr) The same as expr. Used for grouping.</p>

<p>The above expressions are listed in order of precedence
(highest first); &amp; and | have the same precedence.</p>

<p>Macro interface Each reference starts with a call to the
macro ]-. The string [F will be defined to be the label for
this reference, unless the no-label-in- reference command
has been given. There then follows a series of string
definitions, one for each field: string [X corresponds to
field X. The number register [P is set to 1 if the P field
contains a range of pages. The [T, [A and [O number
registers are set to 1 according as the T, A and O fields
end with one of the characters .?!. The [E num- ber register
will be set to 1 if the [E string contains more than one
name. The reference is followed by a call to the ][ macro.
The first argument to this macro gives a number representing
the type of the ref- erence. If a reference contains a J
field, it will be classified as type 1, otherwise if it
contains a B field, it will type 3, otherwise if it contains
a G or R field it will be type 4, otherwise if contains a I
field it will be type 2, otherwise it will be type 0. The
second argument is a symbolic name for the type: other,
journal-article, book, article-in-book or tech-report.
Groups of references that have been accumulated or are
produced by the bibliography command are preceded by a call
to the ]&lt; macro and followed by a call to the ]&gt;
macro.</p>
