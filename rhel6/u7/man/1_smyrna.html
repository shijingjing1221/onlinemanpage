<p>NAME smyrna - interactive graph viewer</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS smyrna [ -v? ] [ file ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION smyrna is a viewer for graphs in the DOT
format. It is especially designed to handle large graphs,
and allows flat and topological fish- eye views. It is
assumed the input graph has position information associated
with all nodes. Using the Graphviz convention, a nodes
position is given by its pos attribute consisting of 2 or 3
floating point numbers separated by commas. Nodes are drawn
as points and edges as line segments.</p>

<p>If smyrna detects that the file contains xdot
attributes, it will use this information when drawing nodes
and edges.</p>

<p>smyrna supports panning and zooming; node and edge
selection; setting and retrieving node and edge attributes,
especially colors; and node movement. The Smyrna Settings
dialogue box available under the Edit pull-down menu gives
the user many choices for tailoring the graph view. These
include whether or not nodes/edges are drawn; what labels
are associated with nodes/edges; node size; transparency
settings for nodes/edges; parameters associated with the
topological fisheye view.</p>

<p>For the purposes of exploratory data analysis, smyrna
provides access to the gvpr library. This allows the user to
arbitrarily query, filter or manipulate a graph. When
filtering or manipulating a graph, the user has the option
of performing the changes directly on the input graph, or to
create a new version with the changes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options are supported:</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p>-? Print usage information.</p>

<p>By default, gc returns the number of nodes and
edges.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand is supported:</p>

<p>file Name of file containing a graph in DOT format. If
no file operand is specified, the user can employ the File
pull-down menu to select a file to be opened.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>1 If no No appropriate OpenGL-capable visual found, or
if the default attributes template graph file or the default
attributes widget graph file could not be read.</p>

<p>FILES smyrna relies on numerous support files. These are
usually installed in the &quot;share/graphviz/smyrna&quot;
directory below the installation root. The principal files
are:</p>

<p>template.dot A file in DOT format specifying the default
smyrna settings. In particular, these are used to initialize
the settings of the Smyrna Settings dialogue box.</p>

<p>mouse_actions.txt A text file specifying the mapping of
concrete mouse and key- board events with smyrna actions
such as panning and selecting.</p>

<p>attr_widgets.dot A file in DOT format specifying the
bindings between GUI widgets and smyrna parameters.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SMYRNA_PATH allows a user to
override the built-in path to the directory containing all
of smyrnas files described above.</p>
