<p>DESCRIPTION pmview is a generalized 3D performance
metrics visualization tool for the Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP(1)).</p>

<p>pmview is the base utility behind performance metrics
visualization tools such as dkvis(1), mpvis(1), osvis(1) and
nfsvis(1), It is also used by a range of related tools that
are specific to optional Perfor- mance Domain Agents (PMDA)
and/or PCP add-on products. pmview may also be used to
construct customized 3D performance displays.</p>

<p>pmview displays performance metrics as colored blocks
and cylinders arranged on monochrome base planes. Each
object may represent a single performance metric, or a stack
of several performance metrics. Since the objects are
modulated by the value of the metric they represent, only
numerical metrics may be visualized. Objects representing a
sin- gle metric may be modulated in terms of height, color,
or height and color. Objects in a stack may only be height
modulated, but the stack can be normalized to the maximum
height. Labels may be added to the scene to help identify
groups of metrics.</p>

<p>A configuration file (as specified by the -c option, or
read from stan- dard input) is used to specify the position,
color, maximum value and labels of metrics and metric
instances in the scene. The maximum value acts as a
normalization factor and is used to scale the object height
and/or color in proportion to the metric values. Metric
values which exceed the associated maximum value are
displayed as solid white objects. If a metric is
unavailable, the object will have minimum height and will be
colored grey.</p>

<p>Normally, the tool operates in live mode where
performance metrics are fetched in real-time. The user can
view metrics from any host run- ning pmcd(1). pmview can
also replay archives of performance metrics (see
pmlogger(1)) and allow the user to interactively control the
cur- rent replay time and rate using the VCR paradigm. This
is particularly useful for retrospective comparisons and for
post-mortem analysis of performance problems where a remote
system is not accessible or a per- formance analyst is not
available on-site.</p>

<p>All metrics in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS)
with numeric value semantics from any number of hosts or
archives may be visualized. pmview examines the semantics of
the metrics and where sensible, con- verts metric values to
a rate before scaling.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The -S, -T, -O and -A options may
be used to define a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved, set an initial origin within the time window, or
specify a natural alignment of the sample times; refer to
PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of these options.</p>

<p>The other available options are:</p>

<p>-a archive[,archive,...]] Specify an archive from which
metrics can be obtained for a par- ticular host. archive is
the basename of an archive, previously created by
pmlogger(1). Multiple archives (separated by commas or in
different -a options) from different hosts may be given, but
an error will occur if there is more than one archive from
the same host. Any metrics that are not associated with a
spe- cific host or archive in the configuration file will
use the first archive as their source.</p>

<p>-C Parse the configuration file and exit before
displaying the pmview window. Any errors in the
configuration file are dis- played.</p>

<p>-c configfile Load the configuration from configfile
rather than standard input.</p>

<p>-h host Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host,
rather than the default localhost. Implies that pmview will
run in live mode, so no archives can be specified on the
command line or in the configuration file. Only one -h
option may be given.</p>

<p>-n pmnsfile Normally pmview operates on the distributed
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n
option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from
the file pmnsfile.</p>

<p>-p port Connect to the time controls (see pmtime(1)) on
this port. Used when a tool launches another tool so that
they can connect to the same time controls.</p>

<p>-R logconfig Use logconfig as the pmlogger(1) config
when recording.</p>

<p>-r addconfig Append addconfig onto the pmlogger(1)
config generated by pmview when recording.</p>

<p>-t interval The update interval used to fetch metrics
from the live or archive sources. The interval argument
follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1), and in the
simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units
in this case are seconds). The default is 2.0 seconds.</p>

<p>-x version Use the specified version of the pmlaunch(5)
specification. The versions currently supported are 1.0 and
the default version 2.0.</p>

<p>-Z timezone By default, pmview reports the time of day
according to the local timezone on the system where pmview
is run. The -Z option changes the default timezone to
timezone which should be in the format of the environment
variable TZ as described in envi- ron(5).</p>

<p>-z Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone
at the host that is the source of the performance metrics,
as identified via either the -h option, or the first -a
option.</p>

<p>-geometry geometry -display display -name name -title
title -xrm &quot;resourceName: value&quot;</p>

<p>Most standard X(1) command line arguments may be
used.</p>

<p>WINDOW The pmview window is comprised of a menu bar,
time and scale controls, metric and time values, and an
examiner viewer (see ivview(1)), which displays the 3D
scene.</p>

<p>EXAMINER VIEWER The left, right and bottom edges of the
examiner viewer contain a vari- ety of thumb wheels and
buttons that can be used to adjust the visual- ization of
the 3D scene. The Rotx and Roty thumb wheels allow the user
to rotate the scene about the x and y axes, respectively.
The dolly thumb wheel moves the virtual camera closer and
further from the scene allowing the user to examine specific
parts in detail or view the entire scene. On the right edge
of the viewer are eight buttons which affect the way the
user can interact with the scene.</p>

<p>Pointer Changes the cursor to a pointer which allows
blocks to be selected in the scene. See the Metric Selection
section below.</p>

<p>Hand Changes the cursor to a hand which allows the scene
to be rotated, translated and dollied using a combination of
mouse buttons. The left mouse button can be used to rotate
the scene in the direction of the mouse. Releasing the left
mouse button before the mouse has stopped moving will cause
the scene to continue to rotate, which can be stopped by
pressing the left mouse button again. The middle mouse
button will pan the scene, and both mouse buttons act as a
dolly for the virtual camera.</p>

<p>Question Mark Displays the SGI Help information for the
examiner viewer.</p>

<p>Home Changes the scene back to its original position,
unless the home position has been changed by the home
pointer button.</p>

<p>Home Pointer Changes the home position of the scene to
be the scene currently in view.</p>

<p>Eye Resizes the scene so that it completely fits into
the 3D viewing area.</p>

<p>Cross-hairs Moves the object under the cursor to the
center of the viewing area, if the hand cursor has been
selected. Pressing the s key while the cursor is over an
object has the same effect.</p>

<p>Perspective Box Switches the display between perspective
and orthogonal projec- tions.</p>

<p>Pressing the right mouse button within the scene window
will bring up a menu of options which affect how the 3D
scene is drawn. The options include drawing the blocks as
wire frames, and turning on stereo view- ing.</p>

<p>METRIC SELECTION When the pointer cursor is active, more
information about the 3D scene can be obtained. Text
describing the metric represented by the block under the
cursor will be displayed in the top text box of the pmview
window. The text contains the source and name of the metric,
current value and units, and the percentage of the expected
maximum (or normal- ization) value. The text box is updated
whenever the scene is updated with the latest metric values
or when the cursor is moved over another block in the scene.
Moving the cursor over a base plane block, text or the
surrounding space will clear the text box.</p>

<p>Clicking the left mouse button on a block will bind the
text box on that metric instance so that the metric can be
monitored while perform- ing other actions with the mouse.
The block will be highlighted with a red wire frame.
Clicking the left mouse button on text or the space
surrounding the scene will unselect the object, causing the
text box to revert to the original behavior of showing the
metric underneath the cursor.</p>

<p>Selecting a base plane instead of a modulated block will
cause all the blocks on that base plane to be selected. When
more than one object is selected, the text box behaves as if
nothing is selected, so the metric displayed is the metric
currently under the cursor. Multiple selec- tions are also
possible by pressing the SHIFT key while selecting an object
with the left mouse button.</p>

<p>MENUS There are four menus in pmviews user interface
which allow scenes to be recorded, saved and printed (File),
access to the time controls (Options), launching other tools
(Launch) and online help (Help).</p>

<p>File/Record When in live mode, this option will launch
pmlogger(1) pro- cesses to record the current scene into an
archive folio (see pmafm(1)) so that it may be replayed at a
later time. This option is not available in replay mode.</p>

<p>When File/Record is selected, a file chooser dialog will
prompt for the name of the new archive folio. If the
directory to the folio does not exist, pmview will attempt
to create it. It is usually convenient to keep each folio
within its own directory as there will be several other
files associated with the folio, including the generated
archives.</p>

<p>Once a valid folio has been created, pmview will launch
a pmlog- ger(1) process for each host to collect the metrics
required from that host in the current scene. The current
selections do not affect the set of metrics that are
recorded.</p>

<p>While recording is in progress, a red dot will appear in
the time controls button in the top left-hand corner of the
pmview window. The File/Record option will also change to
File/Stop Recording as only one recording session is
possible at any one time. Selecting blocks or launching
other tools will have no affect on the record- ing
session.</p>

<p>The record session may be terminated by selecting
File/Stop Record- ing. This will display dialogs for each
pmlogger(1) instance describing the size and location of the
archive files before termi- nating each process. When all
pmlogger(1) processes have been ter- minated, the red dot is
removed from the time controls button, and the menu reverts
back to File/Record to allow another recording session to
take place.</p>

<p>If the application exists while recording, a dialog will
appear allowing you to terminate each pmlogger(1) process,
or leave it running unattached.</p>

<p>An archive folio may be replayed using the command:
pmafm folio replay. See pmafm(1) for more details.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for a front-end script which
generates a pmview scene to use metrics that are not
contained in the scene. For example, osvis(1) uses several
hinv metrics to determine the size and layout of some
objects. As these metrics are also needed when replaying the
generated archive with the front-end script, a com- plete
pmlogger(1) config can be specified (-R) that overrides the
pmview generated config, or an additional config can be
appended (-r) to the pmview generated config.</p>

<p>File/Save Saves the current scene to a human-readable
Open Inventor file (see inventor(1)). A file dialog will
prompt for the location of the file. The default file
extension is .iv which is recognized by ivview(1) and some
Web browsers.</p>

<p>File/Print Outputs the current scene to a printer. A
print dialog will be displayed allowing a specific printer
to be selected.</p>

<p>File/Quit pmview immediately exits. If recording was
active, dialogs will be displayed for each pmlogger(1)
process so that they may be termi- nated.</p>

<p>Options/Show Time Control Displays the time controls
(see pmtime(1)) that are driving this instance of pmview.
The time controls may be shared by other tools, including
pmchart(1), that have been launched by other instances of
pmview and oview(1). Therefore, this menu item may appear to
have no affect if the time controls are already visible.</p>

<p>Options/New Time Control Disconnect with the current
time controls (which may be shared by other tools, see
pmtime(1)) and use a new time control that is not connected
to any other tools. The new time control will be immedi-
ately displayed.</p>

<p>Launch The launch menu is generated from a menu
specification file (see pmlaunch(5)). The menu contains
tools that may be launched based on the sources and names of
the selected metrics in the scene. For example, if the
selected metrics are from three different hosts, then three
copies of a tool may be launched, one for each host. The
behavior of a launch depends on the selected metrics and the
tools being launched.</p>

<p>On selection of a Launch menu item pmview generates
state informa- tion in the pmlaunch(5) metrics specification
format. This pro- vides a description of the selected
metrics (or if there are no selections, all the metrics) in
the scene without any geometry information.</p>

<p>Tools which can monitor multiple hosts and user
specified metrics may be launched only once for those
metrics (eg pmdumptext(1)). Other tools which have a fixed
view for one host (eg mpvis(1)), may be launched multiple
times, once for each host in the selected met- ric list. If
the launched tools have time controls, they will share the
time controls with the launching pmview.</p>

<p>The set of launched tools is configurable, and may
include IRIX and user applications. See pmlaunch(5) for more
details.</p>

<p>Help/... If pcp.books.help has been installed, then the
insight(1) books for pmview are displayed.</p>

<p>TIME CONTROLS In addition to the menu options for time
controls, the current direc- tion of the time controls (see
pmtime(1)) is shown in a button in the top-left corner of
the pmview window. Pressing this button will dis- play the
time control and is identical in behavior to Options/Show
Time Control.</p>

<p>SCALE CONTROLS Above the examiner window is a thumb
wheel and an editable text box which allow the user to apply
a multiplier to all values represented in the scene.
Spinning the wheel to the right and/or increasing the text
value for the scale will increase the height of the bars.
Spinning the wheel to the left and/or lowering the text
value will decrease the height of the bars. The button to
the right of the thumb wheel will reset the scale so that
the bars appear at the original height for their current
value.</p>

<p>TIME INFORMATION Beside the scale controls is another
text box which displays the time of the fetched metrics. The
time will change with the time controller (see
pmtime(1)).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The default face of the 3D font in the
pmview window can be altered via PMVIEW_FONT environment
variable which can be set to the base name of a Type1 font
file in the default Inventor fonts directory.</p>
