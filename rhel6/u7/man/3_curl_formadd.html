<p>curl_formadd(3) libcurl Manual curl_formadd(3)</p>

<p>NAME curl_formadd - add a section to a
multipart/formdata HTTP POST</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURLFORMcode curl_formadd(struct curl_httppost **
firstitem, struct curl_httppost ** lastitem, ...);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION curl_formadd() is used to append sections
when building a multi- part/formdata HTTP POST (sometimes
referred to as RFC2388-style posts). Append one section at a
time until youve added all the sections you want included
and then you pass the firstitem pointer as parameter to
CURLOPT_HTTPPOST. lastitem is set after each call and on
repeated invokes it should be left as set to allow repeated
invokes to find the end of the list faster.</p>

<p>After the lastitem pointer follow the real
arguments.</p>

<p>The pointers *firstitem and *lastitem should both be
pointing to NULL in the first call to this function. All
list-data will be allocated by the function itself. You must
call curl_formfree(3) after the form post has been done to
free the resources.</p>

<p>Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a
&quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; header. You can disable
this header with CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER as usual.</p>

<p>First, there are some basics you need to understand
about multi- part/formdata posts. Each part consists of at
least a NAME and a CON- TENTS part. If the part is made for
file upload, there are also a stored CONTENT-TYPE and a
FILENAME. Below, we ll discuss what options you use to set
these properties in the parts you want to add to your
post.</p>

<p>The options listed first are for making normal parts.
The options from CURLFORM_FILE through CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH
are for file upload parts.</p>

<p>OPTIONS CURLFORM_COPYNAME followed by a string which
provides the name of this part. libcurl copies the string so
your application doesnt need to keep it around after this
function call. If the name isnt NUL- terminated, or if you d
like it to contain zero bytes, you must set its length with
CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH. The copied data will be freed by
curl_formfree(3).</p>

<p>CURLFORM_PTRNAME followed by a string which provides the
name of this part. libcurl will use the pointer and refer to
the data in your application, so you must make sure it
remains until curl no longer needs it. If the name isn t
NUL-terminated, or if youd like it to contain zero bytes,
you must set its length with CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS followed by a pointer to the
contents of this part, the actual data to send away. libcurl
copies the provided data, so your application doesnt need to
keep it around after this function call. If the data isnt
null terminated, or if youd like it to contain zero bytes,
you must set the length of the name with
CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH. The copied data will be freed by
curl_formfree(3).</p>

<p>CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS followed by a pointer to the
contents of this part, the actual data to send away. libcurl
will use the pointer and refer to the data in your
application, so you must make sure it remains until curl no
longer needs it. If the data isnt NUL-terminated, or if youd
like it to contain zero bytes, you must set its length with
CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH followed by a long giving the
length of the contents. Note that for CURLFORM_STREAM
contents, this option is mandatory.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_FILECONTENT followed by a filename, causes that
file to be read and its con- tents used as data in this
part. This part does not automati- cally become a file
upload part simply because its data was read from a
file.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_FILE followed by a filename, makes this part a
file upload part. It sets the filename field to the basename
of the provided file- name, it reads the contents of the
file and passes them as data and sets the content-type if
the given file match one of the internally known file
extensions. For CURLFORM_FILE the user may send one or more
files in one part by providing multiple CURLFORM_FILE
arguments each followed by the filename (and each
CURLFORM_FILE is allowed to have a
CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE).</p>

<p>CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE is used in combination with
CURLFORM_FILE. Followed by a pointer to a string which
provides the content-type for this part, pos- sibly instead
of an internally chosen one.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_FILENAME is used in combination with
CURLFORM_FILE. Followed by a pointer to a string, it tells
libcurl to use the given string as the filename in the file
upload part instead of the actual file name.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_BUFFER is used for custom file upload parts
without use of CURL- FORM_FILE. It tells libcurl that the
file contents are already present in a buffer. The parameter
is a string which provides the filename field in the content
header.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR is used in combination with
CURLFORM_BUFFER. The parameter is a pointer to the buffer to
be uploaded. This buffer must not be freed until after
curl_easy_cleanup(3) is called. You must also use
CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH to set the number of bytes in the
buffer.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH is used in combination with
CURLFORM_BUFFER. The parameter is a long which gives the
length of the buffer.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_STREAM Tells libcurl to use the
CURLOPT_READFUNCTION callback to get data. The parameter you
pass to CURLFORM_STREAM is the pointer passed on to the read
callbacks fourth argument. If you want the part to look like
a file upload one, set the CURLFORM_FILE- NAME parameter as
well. Note that when using CURLFORM_STREAM,
CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH must also be set with the total
expected length of the part. (Option added in libcurl
7.18.2)</p>

<p>CURLFORM_ARRAY Another possibility to send options to
curl_formadd() is the CURLFORM_ARRAY option, that passes a
struct curl_forms array pointer as its value. Each
curl_forms structure element has a CURLformoption and a char
pointer. The final element in the array must be a
CURLFORM_END. All available options can be used in an array,
except the CURLFORM_ARRAY option itself! The last argument
in such an array must always be CURLFORM_END.</p>

<p>CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER specifies extra headers for the
form POST section. This takes a curl_slist prepared in the
usual way using curl_slist_append and appends the list of
headers to those libcurl automatically gen- erates. The list
must exist while the POST occurs, if you free it before the
post completes you may experience problems.</p>

<p>When you ve passed the HttpPost pointer to
curl_easy_setopt(3) (using the CURLOPT_HTTPPOST option), you
must not free the list until after youve called
curl_easy_cleanup(3) for the curl han- dle.</p>

<p>See example below.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE 0 means everything was ok, non-zero means
an error occurred correspond- ing to a CURL_FORMADD_*
constant defined in &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>EXAMPLE struct curl_httppost* post = NULL; struct
curl_httppost* last = NULL; char namebuffer[] = &quot;name
buffer&quot;; long namelength = strlen(namebuffer); char
buffer[] = &quot;test buffer&quot;; char htmlbuffer[] =
&quot;&lt;HTML&gt;test buffer&lt;/HTML&gt;&quot;; long
htmlbufferlength = strlen(htmlbuffer); struct curl_forms
forms[3]; char file1[] = &quot;my-face.jpg&quot;; char
file2[] = &quot;your-face.jpg&quot;; /* add null character
into htmlbuffer, to demonstrate that transfers of buffers
containing null characters actually work */ htmlbuffer[8] =
;</p>

<p>/* Add simple name/content section */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;name&quot;, CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS,
&quot;content&quot;, CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add simple name/content/contenttype section */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;htmlcode&quot;, CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS,
&quot;&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;&quot;, CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE,
&quot;text/html&quot;, CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add name/ptrcontent section */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;name_for_ptrcontent&quot;, CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS,
buffer, CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add ptrname/ptrcontent section */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_PTRNAME,
namebuffer, CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS, buffer,
CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH, namelength, CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add name/ptrcontent/contenttype section */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;html_code_with_hole&quot;, CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS,
htmlbuffer, CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH, htmlbufferlength,
CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, &quot;text/html&quot;,
CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add simple file section */ curl_formadd(&amp;post,
&amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;picture&quot;,
CURLFORM_FILE, &quot;my-face.jpg&quot;, CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add file/contenttype section */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;picture&quot;, CURLFORM_FILE, &quot;my-face.jpg&quot;,
CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, &quot;image/jpeg&quot;,
CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add two file section */ curl_formadd(&amp;post,
&amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;pictures&quot;,
CURLFORM_FILE, &quot;my-face.jpg&quot;, CURLFORM_FILE,
&quot;your-face.jpg&quot;, CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* Add two file section using CURLFORM_ARRAY */
forms[0].option = CURLFORM_FILE; forms[0].value = file1;
forms[1].option = CURLFORM_FILE; forms[1].value = file2;
forms[2].option = CURLFORM_END;</p>

<p>/* Add a buffer to upload */ curl_formadd(&amp;post,
&amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, &quot;name&quot;,
CURLFORM_BUFFER, &quot;data&quot;, CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR,
record, CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH, record_length,
CURLFORM_END);</p>

<p>/* no option needed for the end marker */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;pictures&quot;, CURLFORM_ARRAY, forms, CURLFORM_END);
/* Add the content of a file as a normal post text value */
curl_formadd(&amp;post, &amp;last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME,
&quot;filecontent&quot;, CURLFORM_FILECONTENT,
&quot;.bashrc&quot;, CURLFORM_END); /* Set the form info */
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPPOST, post);</p>
