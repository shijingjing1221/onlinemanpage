<p>EXEC(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual EXEC(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME exec - execute commands and open, close, or copy
file descriptors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS exec [command [argument ...]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The exec utility shall open, close, and/or
copy file descriptors as specified by any redirections as
part of the command.</p>

<p>If exec is specified without command or arguments, and
any file descriptors with numbers greater than 2 are opened
with associated redirection statements, it is unspecified
whether those file descrip- tors remain open when the shell
invokes another utility. Scripts con- cerned that child
shells could misuse open file descriptors can always close
them explicitly, as shown in one of the following
examples.</p>

<p>If exec is specified with command, it shall replace the
shell with com- mand without creating a new process. If
arguments are specified, they shall be arguments to command.
Redirection affects the current shell execution
environment.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>OPERANDS See the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES None.</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS If command is specified, exec shall not
return to the shell; rather, the exit status of the process
shall be the exit status of the program implementing
command, which overlaid the shell. If command is not found,
the exit status shall be 127. If command is found, but it is
not an executable utility, the exit status shall be 126. If
a redirection error occurs (see Consequences of Shell Errors
), the shell shall exit with a value in the range 1-125.
Otherwise, exec shall return a zero exit status.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Open readfile as file descriptor 3 for
reading:</p>

<p>exec 3&lt; readfile</p>

<p>Open writefile as file descriptor 4 for writing:</p>

<p>exec 4&gt; writefile</p>

<p>Make file descriptor 5 a copy of file descriptor 0:</p>

<p>exec 5&lt;&amp;0</p>

<p>Close file descriptor 3:</p>

<p>exec 3&lt;&amp;-</p>

<p>Cat the file maggie by replacing the current shell with
the cat util- ity:</p>

<p>exec cat maggie</p>

<p>RATIONALE Most historical implementations were not
conformant in that:</p>

<p>foo=bar exec cmd</p>

<p>did not pass foo to cmd.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
