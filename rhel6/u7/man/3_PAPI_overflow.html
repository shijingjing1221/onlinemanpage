<p>PAPI_overflow(3) PAPI PAPI_overflow(3)</p>

<p>NAME PAPI_overflow - set up an event set to begin
registering overflows _papi_overflow_handler - user defined
function to process overflow events</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS C Interface #include &lt;papi.h&gt; int
PAPI_overflow (int EventSet, int EventCode, int threshold,
int flags, PAPI_overflow_handler_t handler);
(*PAPI_overflow_handler_t) _papi_overflow_handler (int
EventSet, void * address, long_long overflow_vector, void *
context); Fortran Interface Not implemented</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION PAPI_overflow() marks a specific EventCode
in an EventSet to generate an overflow signal after every
threshold events are counted. More than one event in an
event set can be used to trigger overflows. In such cases,
the user must call this function once for each overflowing
event. To turn off overflow on a specified event, call this
function with a threshold value of 0.</p>

<p>Overflows can be implemented in either software or
hardware, but the scope is the entire event set. PAPI
defaults to hardware overflow if it is available. In the
case of software overflow, a periodic timer interrupt causes
PAPI to compare the event counts against the threshold
values and call the overflow handler if one or more events
have exceeded their threshold. In the case of hardware
overflow, the coun- ters are typically set to the negative
of the threshold value and count up to 0. This zero-crossing
triggers a hardware interrupt that calls the overflow
handler. Because of this counter interrupt, the counter
values for overflowing counters may be very small or even
negative num- bers, and cannot be relied upon as accurate.
In such cases the overflow handler can approximate the
counts by supplying the threshold value whenever an overflow
occurs.</p>

<p>_papi_overflow_handler() is a placeholder for a
user-defined function to process overflow events. A pointer
to this function is passed to the PAPI_overflow routine,
where it is invoked whenever a software or hardware overflow
occurs. This handler receives the EventSet of the
overflowing event, the Program Counter address when the
interrupt occured, an overflow_vector that can be processed
to determined which event(s) caused the overflow, and a
pointer to the machine context, which can be used in a
platform-specific manor to extract register information
about what was happening when the overflow occured.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS EventSet -- an integer handle to a PAPI event
set as created by PAPI_create_eventset(3)</p>

<p>EventCode -- the preset or native event code to be set
for overflow detection. This event must have already been
added to the EvenSet.</p>

<p>threshold -- the overflow threshold value for this
EventCode.</p>

<p>flags -- bit map that controls the overflow mode of
operation. Set to PAPI_OVERFLOW_FORCE_SW to force software
overflowing, even if hardware overflow support is available.
If hardware overflow support is available on a given system,
it will be the default mode of operation. There are
situations where it is advantageous to use software overflow
instead. Although software overflow is inherently less
accurate, with more latency and processing overhead, it does
allow for overflowing on derived events, and for the
accurate recording of overflowing event counts. These two
features are typically not available with hardware overflow.
Only one type of overflow is allowed per event set, so set-
ting one event to hardware overflow and another to forced
software overflow will result in an error being
returned.</p>

<p>handler -- pointer to the user supplied handler function
to call upon overflow</p>

<p>address -- the Program Counter address at the time of
the overflow</p>

<p>overflow_vector -- a long_long word containing flag bits
to indicate which hardware counter(s) caused the
overflow</p>

<p>*context -- pointer to a machine specific structure that
defines the register context at the time of overflow. This
parameter is often unused and can be ignored in the user
function.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES On success, PAPI_overflow returns PAPI_OK.
On error, a non-zero error code is returned.
_papi_overflow_handler is a void function and returns
nothing.</p>

<p>ERRORS PAPI_EINVAL One or more of the arguments is
invalid. Specifically, a bad threshold value.</p>

<p>PAPI_ENOMEM Insufficient memory to complete the
operation.</p>

<p>PAPI_ENOEVST The EventSet specified does not exist.</p>

<p>PAPI_EISRUN The EventSet is currently counting
events.</p>

<p>PAPI_ECNFLCT The underlying counter hardware cannot
count this event and other events in the EventSet
simultaneously. Or you are trying to overflow both by
hardware and by forced software at the same time.</p>

<p>PAPI_ENOEVNT The PAPI preset is not available on the
underlying hardware.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Define a simple overflow handler: void
handler(int EventSet, void *address, long_long
overflow_vector, void *context) {
fprintf(stderr,&quot;Overflow at %p! bit=0x%llx 0,
address,overflow_vector); }</p>

<p>Call PAPI_overflow for an event set containing the
PAPI_TOT_INS event, setting the threshold to 100000. Use the
handler defined above. retval = PAPI_overflow(EventSet,
PAPI_TOT_INS, 100000, 0, handler);</p>

<p>BUGS This function has no known bugs.</p>
