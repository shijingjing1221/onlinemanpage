<p>NAME gvcolor - flow colors through a ranked digraph (
previously known as colorize )</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gvcolor [ files ]</p>

<p>USAGE &lt;format&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gvcolor is a filter that sets node colors
from initial seed values. Colors flow along edges from tail
to head, and are averaged (as HSB vectors) at nodes. The
graph must already have been processed by dot. Appropriate
choice of initial colors yields drawings in which node col-
ors help to emphasize logical relationships between nodes,
even when they are spread far apart in the layout.</p>

<p>Initial colors must be set externally, using the color
attribute of a node. It is often effective to assign colors
to a few key source or sink nodes, manually setting their
colors by editing the graph file. Color names are as in
dot(1): symbolic names or RGB triples. It is best to choose
some easily-distinguished but related colors; not neces-
sarily spaced evenly around the color wheel. For example,
blue_green, green, and light_yellow looks better than red,
green, blue.</p>

<p>Certain graph attributes control the gvcolor algorithm.
flow=back reverses the flow of colors from heads to tails.
saturation=.1,.9 (or any two numbers between 0 and 1)
adjusts the color saturation linearly from least to greatest
rank. If Defcolor is set, this color value is applied to any
node not otherwise colored.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>1 If nodes of the graph do not possess a pos
attribute.</p>

<p>BUGS It would be nice to make the program work without
relying on an initial pass through dot.</p>
