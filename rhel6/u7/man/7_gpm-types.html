<p>GPM-TYPES(7) GPM-TYPES(7)</p>

<p>NAME gpm-types - pointer types (mice, tablets, etc.)
managed by gpm. The information below is extracted from the
texinfo file, which is the preferred source of
information.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manpage describes the various pointer
types currently available in gpm. If you look at the source
code, youll find that pointer-specific code is confined to
mice.c (while it used to only include mouse decoders, gpm
now supports tablets and touchscreens as well).</p>

<p>The mouse type is specified on command line with the -t
option. The option takes an argument, which represents the
name of a mouse type. Each type can be associated to
different names. For old mouse types, one name is the old
selection-compatible name, and another is the XFree name.
After version 1.18.1 of gpm, the number of synonyms was made
arbitrary and the actual name being used is made available
to the func- tion responsible for mouse initialization.
Therefore it is possible for a mouse decoder to behave
slightly differently according to the name being used for
the device (if this feature was already present, we wouldn t
have for example ms+ and ms+lr as different mouse
types).</p>

<p>The initialization procedure of each mouse type can also
receive extra option, by means of the -o command line
option. Since interpretation of the option string is
decoder-specific, the allowed options are described in
association to each mouse type. When no description of
option strings is provided, that means the option string is
unused for that mouse type and specifying one generates an
error. When the docu- ment refer to standard serial options
it means that one of -o dtr, -o rts, -o both can be
specified to toggle the control lines of the serial
port.</p>

<p>The following mouse type are corrently recognized:</p>

<p>bare Microsoft The Microsoft protocol, without any
extension. It only reports two buttons. If your device has
three, you should either try running the mman decoder or
msc. In the latter case, you need to tell the mouse to talk
msc protocol by toggling the DTR and RTS lines (with one of
-o drt, -o rts or -o both) or invoking gpm -t msc while
keeping the middle button pressed. Very annoying, indeed.
This mouse decoder accepts standard serial options, although
they should not be needed.</p>

<p>ms This is the original Microsoft protocol, with a
middle-button extension. Some old two-button devices send
some spurious pack- ets which can be misunderstood as
middle-button events. If this is your case, use the bare
mouse type. Some new two-button devices are plug and play,
and they dont play fair at all; in this case try -t pnp.
Many (most) three-button devices that use the microsoft
protocol fail to report some middle-button events during
mouse motion. Since the protocol does not distin- guish
between the middle button going up and the middle button
going down it would be liable to get out of step, so this
decoder declares the middle button to be up whenever the
mouse moves. This prevents dragging with the middle button,
so you should probably use -t ms+lr instead of this decoder,
especially if you want to use X. This mouse decoder accepts
standard serial options, although they should not be
needed.</p>

<p>ms+ This is the same as -t ms except that the middle
button is not reset during mouse motion. So you can drag
with the middle but- ton. However, if your mouse exhibits
the usual buggy behaviour the decoder is likely to get out
of step with reality, thinking the middle button is up when
its down and vice versa. You should probably use -t ms+lr
instead of this decoder. This mouse decoder accepts standard
serial options, although they should not be needed.</p>

<p>ms+lr This is the same as -t ms+ except that there is an
additional facility to reset the state of the middle button
by pressing the other two buttons together. Do this when the
decoder gets into a confused state where it thinks the
middle button is up when its down and vice versa. (If you
get sick of having to do this, please dont blame gpm; blame
your buggy mouse! Note that most three-button mice that do
the microsoft protocol can be made to do the MouseSystems
protocol instead. The 3 Button Serial Mouse mini-HOWTO has
information about this.) This mouse decoder accepts standard
serial options, although they should not be needed.</p>

<p>msc MouseSystems This is the standard protocol for
three-button serial devices. Some of such devices only enter
MouseSystem mode if the RTS, DTR or both lines are pushed
low. Thus, you may try -t msc associ- ated with -o rts, -o
dtr or -o both.</p>

<p>mman Mouseman The protocol used by the new Logitech
devices with three but- tons. It is backward compatible with
the Microsoft protocol, so if your mouse has three buttons
and works with -t ms or similar decoders you may try -t mman
instead to use the middle button. This mouse decoder accepts
standard serial options, although they should not be
needed.</p>

<p>sun The protocol used on Sparc computers and a few
others. This mouse decoder accepts standard serial options,
although they should not be needed.</p>

<p>mm MMSeries Title says it all. This mouse decoder
accepts standard serial options, although they should not be
needed.</p>

<p>logi Logitech This is the protocol used by old serial
Logitech mice.</p>

<p>bm BusMouse Some bus devices use this protocol,
including those produced by Logitech.</p>

<p>ps2 PS/2 The protocol used by most busmice.</p>

<p>ncr This type is able to decode the pointing pen found
on some laptops (the NCR 3125 pen)</p>

<p>wacom The protocol used by the Wacom tablet. Since
version 1.18.1 we have a new Wacom decoder, as the old one
was not working with new tablets. This decoder was tested
with Ultrapad, PenPartner, and Graphire tablets. Options: -o
relative (default) for rela- tive mode, -o absolute for
absolute mode.</p>

<p>genitizer The This mouse decoder accepts standard serial
options, although they should not be needed.</p>

<p>logim Used to turn Logitech mice into
Mouse-Systems-Compatible. Obvi- ously, it only works with
some of the Logitech mice.</p>

<p>pnp This decoder works with the new mice produces by our
friend Bill, and maybe with the old ones as well. The Pnp
protocol is hardwired at 1200 baud and is upset by normal
initialization, so this is a -t bare decoder with no
initialization at all. This mouse decoder accepts standard
serial options, although they should not be needed.</p>

<p>ms3 A decoder for the new serial IntelliMouse devices,
the ones with three buttons and a protocol incompatible with
older ones. The wheel is currently unused.</p>

<p>imps2 IntelliMouse on the ps/2 port. This type can also
be used for a generic 2-button ps/2 mouse too, since it will
auto-detect the type.</p>

<p>netmouse Decodes the Genius NetMouse type of devices on
the ps/2 port. For serial Netmouse devices, use the ms3
decoder.</p>

<p>cal A decoder of the Calcomp UltraSlate device.</p>

<p>calr Same as above, but in relative mode.</p>

<p>twid Support for the twiddler keyboard. As of gpm-1.14
this decoder includes a char generator for the text console,
but doesnt yet support X keycodes. If used with -R, gpm will
anyway repeat mouse events to the X server. More information
about twiddler support can be found in README.twiddler, in
the gpm distribu- tion.</p>

<p>syn synaptics A decoder for the Synaptics TouchPad
connected to the serial port. This mouse decoder accepts
standard serial options, although they should not be
needed.</p>

<p>synps2 synaptics_ps2 Same as above, but for the devices
attached to the ps2 port.</p>

<p>brw A decoder for the Fellowes Browser, a device with 4
buttons and a wheel. This mouse decoder accepts standard
serial options, although they should not be needed.</p>

<p>js Joystick This mouse type uses the joystick device to
generate mouse events. It is only available if the header
linux/joystick.h is found at compile time. The header (and
the device as well) has been introduced only during 2.1
development, and is not present in version 2.0 of the
kernel.</p>

<p>summa This is a decode for the Symmagraphics of Genius
tablet, run in absolute mode. A repeater is associated to
this decoder, so it can -R summa can be used to generate X
events even for other absolute-pointing devices, like
touchscreens. To use the repeated data from X, you need a
modified xf86Summa.o module.</p>

<p>mtouch A decoder for the MicroTouch touch screen. Please
refer to the file README.microtouch in the source tree of
gpm for further information. In the near future, anyways, I
plan to fold back to this documentation the content of that
file.</p>

<p>gunze A decoder for the gunze touch screen. Please refer
to the file README.gunze in the source tree of gpm for
further information. In the near future, anyways, I plan to
fold back to this docu- mentation the content of that file.
The decoder accepts the fol- lowing options: smooth=,
debounce=. An higher smoothness results in slower motion as
well; a smaller smoothness gives faster motion but,
obviously, less smooth. The default smoothness is 9. The
debounce time is express in milliseconds and is the mini-
mum duration of an up-down event to be taken as a tap.
Smaller bounces are ignored.</p>

<p>acecad The Acecad tablet in absolute mode.</p>

<p>wp wizardpad Genius WizardPad tablet</p>

<p>FILES src/mice.c The source file for pointer
decoders</p>
