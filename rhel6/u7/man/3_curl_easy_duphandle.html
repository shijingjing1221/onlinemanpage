<p>NAME curl_easy_duphandle - Clone a libcurl session
handle</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</p>

<p>CURL *curl_easy_duphandle(CURL *handle);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This function will return a new curl handle,
a duplicate, using all the options previously set in the
input curl handle. Both handles can sub- sequently be used
independently and they must both be freed with
curl_easy_cleanup(3).</p>

<p>All strings that the input handle has been told to point
to (as opposed to copy) with previous calls to
curl_easy_setopt(3) using char * inputs, will be pointed to
by the new handle as well. You must there- fore make sure to
keep the data around until both handles have been cleaned
up.</p>

<p>The new handle will not inherit any state information,
no connections, no SSL sessions and no cookies.</p>

<p>Note that even in multi-threaded programs, this function
must be called in a synchronous way, the input handle may
not be in use when cloned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If this function returns NULL, something
went wrong and no valid handle was returned.</p>
