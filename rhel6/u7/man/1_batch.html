<p>AT(1) Linux Programmer s Manual AT(1)</p>

<p>NAME at, batch, atq, atrm - queue, examine or delete
jobs for later execu- tion</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS at [-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mMlbv] TIME at
[-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mMlbv] -t time_arg at -c job
[job...] at [ -rd ] job [job...] atq [-V] [-q queue] atrm
[-V] job [job...] batch</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION at and batch read commands from standard
input or a specified file which are to be executed at a
later time.</p>

<p>at executes commands at a specified time.</p>

<p>atq lists the users pending jobs, unless the user is the
supe- ruser; in that case, everybodys jobs are listed. The
format of the output lines (one for each job) is: Job
number, date, hour, queue, and username.</p>

<p>atrm deletes jobs, identified by their job number.</p>

<p>batch executes commands when system load levels permit;
in other words, when the load average drops below 0.8, or
the value specified in the invocation of atd.</p>

<p>At allows fairly complex time specifications, extending
the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to
run a job at a spe- cific time of day. (If that time is
already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify
midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a
time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the
morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job
will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day
with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDDYY
or MM/DD/YY or DD.MM.YY or YYYY-MM-DD. The specification of
a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You
can also give times like now + count time-units, where the
time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can
tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with
today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with
tomorrow.</p>

<p>For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now,
you would do at 4pm + 3 days, to run a job at 10:00am on
July 31, you would do at 10am Jul 31 and to run a job at 1am
tomorrow, you would do at 1am tomorrow.</p>

<p>The exact definition of the time specification can be
found in /usr/share/doc/at-3.1.10/timespec.</p>

<p>For both at and batch, commands are read from standard
input or the file specified with the -f option and executed.
The working directory, the environment (except for the
variables TERM, DISPLAY and _) and the umask are retained
from the time of invocation. An at - or batch - command
invoked from a su(1) shell will retain the current userid.
The user will be mailed standard error and standard output
from his com- mands, if any. Mail will be sent using the
command /usr/sbin/sendmail. If at is executed from a su(1)
shell, the owner of the login shell will receive the
mail.</p>

<p>The superuser may use these commands in any case. For
other users, permission to use at is determined by the files
/etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny.</p>

<p>If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames
mentioned in it are allowed to use at.</p>

<p>If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is
checked, every user- name not mentioned in it is then
allowed to use at.</p>

<p>If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed use of
at.</p>

<p>An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user is allowed
use these com- mands, this is the default configuration.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -V prints the version number to standard
error.</p>

<p>-q queue uses the specified queue. A queue designation
consists of a single letter; valid queue designations range
from a to z. and A to Z. The a queue is the default for at
and the b queue for batch. Queues with higher letters run
with increased niceness. The special queue &quot;=&quot; is
reserved for jobs which are currently running.</p>

<p>If a job is submitted to a queue designated with an
uppercase letter, the job is treated as if it were submitted
to batch at the time of the job. Once the time is reached,
the batch processing rules with respect to load average
apply. If atq is given a specific queue, it will only show
jobs pending in that queue.</p>

<p>-m Send mail to the user when the job has completed even
if there was no output.</p>

<p>-M Never send mail to the user.</p>

<p>-f file Reads the job from file rather than standard
input.</p>

<p>-l Is an alias for atq.</p>

<p>-r Is an alias for atrm.</p>

<p>-d Is an alias for atrm.</p>

<p>-v Shows the time the job will be executed before
reading the job.</p>

<p>Times displayed will be in the format &quot;Thu Feb 20
14:50:00 1997&quot;.</p>

<p>-c cats the jobs listed on the command line to standard
out- put.</p>

<p>-t time_arg Submit the job to be run at the time
specified by the time_arg option argument, which must have
the same format as specified for the touch(1) utilitys -t
time option argument ([[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm).</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT SHELL The value of the SHELL environment
variable at the time of at invocation will determine which
shell is used to execute the at job commands. If SHELL is
unset when at is invoked, the users login shell will be
used; other- wise, if SHELL is set when at is invoked, it
must contain the path of a shell interpreter executable that
will be used to run the commands at the specified time.</p>

<p>at will record the values of environment variables
present at time of at invocation. When the commands are run
at the speci- fied time, at will restore these variables to
their recorded values . These variables are excluded from
this processing and are never set by at when the commands
are run : TERM, DISPLAY, SHELLOPTS, _, PPID, BASH_VERSINFO,
EUID, UID, GROUPS. If the user submitting the at job is not
the super-user, vari- ables that alter the behaviour of the
loader ld.so(8), such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH , cannot be
recorded and restored by at .</p>

<p>FILES /var/spool/at /var/spool/at/spool /proc/loadavg
/var/run/utmp /etc/at.allow /etc/at.deny</p>

<p>SEE ALSO cron(1), nice(1), sh(1), umask(2), atd(8).</p>

<p>BUGS The correct operation of batch for Linux depends on
the presence of a proc- type directory mounted on /proc.</p>

<p>If the file /var/run/utmp is not available or corrupted,
or if the user is not logged on at the time at is invoked,
the mail is sent to the userid found in the environment
variable LOGNAME. If that is undefined or empty, the current
userid is assumed.</p>

<p>At and batch as presently implemented are not suitable
when users are competing for resources. If this is the case
for your site, you might want to consider another batch
system, such as nqs.</p>
