<p>GETS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual GETS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME gets - get a string from a stdin stream</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>char *gets(char *s);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The gets() function shall read bytes from
the standard input stream, stdin, into the array pointed to
by s, until a &lt;newline&gt; is read or an end-of-file
condition is encountered. Any &lt;newline&gt; shall be
discarded and a null byte shall be placed immediately after
the last byte read into the array.</p>

<p>The gets() function may mark the st_atime field of the
file associated with stream for update. The st_atime field
shall be marked for update by the first successful execution
of fgetc(), fgets(), fread(), getc(), getchar(), gets(),
fscanf(), or scanf() using stream that returns data not
supplied by a prior call to ungetc().</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, gets() shall
return s. If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file
indicator for the stream shall be set and gets() shall
return a null pointer. If a read error occurs, the error
indicator for the stream shall be set, gets() shall return a
null pointer, and set errno to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to fgetc().</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Reading a line that overflows the
array pointed to by s results in undefined behavior. The use
of fgets() is recommended.</p>

<p>Since the user cannot specify the length of the buffer
passed to gets(), use of this function is discouraged. The
length of the string read is unlimited. It is possible to
overflow this buffer in such a way as to cause applications
to fail, or possible system security viola- tions.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the fgets() function should be
used to read input lines.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
