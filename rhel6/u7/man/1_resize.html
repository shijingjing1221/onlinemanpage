<p>RESIZE(1) RESIZE(1)</p>

<p>NAME resize - set TERMCAP and terminal settings to
current xterm window size</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS resize [ -u | -c ] [ -s [ row col ] ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Resize prints a shell command for setting
the TERM and TERMCAP environ- ment variables to indicate the
current size of xterm window from which the command is run.
For this output to take effect, resize must either be
evaluated as part of the command line (usually done with a
shell alias or function) or else redirected to a file which
can then be read in. From the C shell (usually known as
/bin/csh), the following alias could be defined in the users
.cshrc:</p>

<p>% alias rs &rsquo;set noglob; eval
&lsquo;resize&lsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>After resizing the window, the user would type:</p>

<p>% rs</p>

<p>Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as
/bin/sh) that dont have command functions will need to send
the output to a tempo- rary file and then read it back in
with the . command:</p>

<p>$ resize &gt; /tmp/out $ . /tmp/out</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following options may be used with
resize:</p>

<p>-u This option indicates that Bourne shell commands
should be gen- erated even if the user s current shell isn t
/bin/sh.</p>

<p>-c This option indicates that C shell commands should be
generated even if the users current shell isnt /bin/csh.</p>

<p>-s [rows columns] This option indicates that Sun console
escape sequences will be used instead of the VT100-style
xterm escape codes. If rows and columns are given, resize
will ask the xterm to resize itself. However, the window
manager may choose to disallow the change.</p>

<p>Note that the Sun console escape sequences are
recognized by XFree86 xterm and by dtterm. The resize
program may be installed as sunsize, which causes makes it
assume the -s option.</p>

<p>The rows and columns arguments must appear last; though
they are normally associated with the -s option, they are
parsed separately.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/termcap for the base termcap entry to
modify.</p>

<p>~/.cshrc users alias for the command.</p>
