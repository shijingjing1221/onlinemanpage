<p>XZDEC(1) XZ Utils XZDEC(1)</p>

<p>NAME xzdec, lzmadec - Small .xz and .lzma
decompressors</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xzdec [option]... [file]... lzmadec [option]...
[file]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION xzdec is a liblzma-based decompression-only
tool for .xz (and only .xz) files. xzdec is intended to work
as a drop-in replacement for xz(1) in the most common
situations where a script has been written to use xz
--decompress --stdout (and possibly a few other commonly
used options) to decompress .xz files. lzmadec is identical
to xzdec except that lzmadec supports .lzma files instead of
.xz files.</p>

<p>To reduce the size of the executable, xzdec doesnt
support multi- threading or localization, and doesnt read
options from XZ_OPT envi- ronment variable. xzdec doesnt
support displaying intermediate progress information:
sending SIGINFO to xzdec does nothing, but send- ing SIGUSR1
terminates the process instead of displaying progress
information.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d, --decompress, --uncompress Ignored for xz(1)
compatibility. xzdec supports only decompres- sion.</p>

<p>-k, --keep Ignored for xz(1) compatibility. xzdec never
creates or removes any files.</p>

<p>-c, --stdout, --to-stdout Ignored for xz(1)
compatibility. xzdec always writes the decom- pressed data
to standard output.</p>

<p>-M limit, --memory=limit Set the memory usage limit. If
this option is specified multi- ple times, the last one
takes effect. The limit can be specified in multiple
ways:</p>

<p>&middot; The limit can be an absolute value in bytes.
Using an integer suffix like MiB can be useful. Example:
--memory=80MiB</p>

<p>&middot; The limit can be specified as a percentage of
physical RAM. Example: --memory=70%</p>

<p>&middot; The limit can be reset back to its default
value (currently 40 % of physical RAM) by setting it to
0.</p>

<p>&middot; The memory usage limiting can be effectively
disabled by set- ting limit to max. This isnt recommended.
It s usually bet- ter to use, for example, --memory=90%.</p>

<p>The current limit can be seen near the bottom of the
output of the --help option.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Specifying this once does nothing since
xzdec never displays any warnings or notices. Specify this
twice to suppress errors.</p>

<p>-Q, --no-warn Ignored for xz(1) compatibility. xzdec
never uses the exit sta- tus 2.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display a help message and exit
successfully.</p>

<p>-V, --version Display the version number of xzdec and
liblzma.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 All was good.</p>

<p>1 An error occurred.</p>

<p>xzdec doesn t have any warning messages like xz(1) has,
thus the exit status 2 is not used by xzdec.</p>

<p>NOTES xzdec and lzmadec are not really that small. The
size can be reduced further by dropping features from
liblzma at compile time, but that shouldnt usually be done
for executables distributed in typical non- embedded
operating system distributions. If you need a truly small
.xz decompressor, consider using XZ Embedded.</p>
