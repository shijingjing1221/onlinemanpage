<p>SG_START(8) SG3_UTILS SG_START(8)</p>

<p>NAME sg_start - send SCSI START STOP UNIT command to
start, stop, load or eject medium</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_start [0] [1] [--eject] [--help] [--fl=FL]
[--immed] [--load] [--loej] [--mod=PC_MOD] [--noflush]
[--pc=PC] [--start] [--stop] [--verbose] [--version]
DEVICE</p>

<p>sg_start [--eject] [--fl=FL] [-i] [--imm=0|1] [--load]
[--loej] [--mod=PC_MOD] [--noflush] [--pc=PC] [--start]
[--stop] [-v] [-V] [0|1] DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sg_start sends a SCSI START STOP UNIT
command to the DEVICE with the selected options. The most
used options are --stop to spin down a disk and --start to
spin up a disk. Using --start on a disk that is already
spinning is harmless. There is also finer grain control with
&quot;power condition&quot;: active, idle or standby. This
is set with the --pc=PC option. In some contexts the
&quot;stop&quot; state can be considered an addi- tional
power condition.</p>

<p>Devices that contain removable media such as cd/dvds can
use the --loej option to load the medium when used in
conjunction with --start (i.e. load medium then spin up).
Alternatively --loej may be used to eject the medium when
used in conjunction with --stop (i.e. spin down then eject
medium). More simply, the loading or ejecting of a removable
medium can be requested with the --load or --eject
option.</p>

<p>If no option or argument is given then a --start is
assumed; as the utilitys name suggests.</p>

<p>This utility supports two command line syntaxes, the
preferred one is shown first in the synopsis and explained
in this section. A later sec- tion on the old command line
syntax outlines the second group of options.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>0 same action as --stop.</p>

<p>1 same action as --start.</p>

<p>-e, --eject stop the medium and eject it from the drive.
Only appropriate for a device with removable medium. Might
be ignored (pre- vented), see below.</p>

<p>-h, --help print out the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-f, --fl=FL sets the format layer number for the disc to
&quot;jump&quot; to (defined in MMC-5). Values of FL can be
0 to 3. When this option is cho- sen, the FL, LoEj and Start
bits are set in the cdb as required by MMC-5; thus the user
does not need to set the --start and/or --load options.</p>

<p>-i, --immed sets the IMM bit on the START STOP UNIT
command so this utility will return immediately and not wait
for the media to complete the requested action. The default
is to wait until the media to complete the requested action
before returning.</p>

<p>-l, --load load the medium in the drive and start it.
Only appropriate for a removable medium.</p>

<p>-L, --loej sets the LOEJ bit on the START STOP UNIT
command. This loads the media when the unit is started or
eject it when the unit is stopped (i.e. works in conjunction
with START bit in cdb). This option is ignored if pc &gt; 0.
Default is off (i.e. dont attempt to load or eject media).
If a start/start indication is not given (i.e. neither
--start nor --stop) and this option is given then a load and
start action is assumed.</p>

<p>-m, --mod=PC_MOD where PC_MOD is the power condition
modifier value. 0 to 15 (inclusive) are valid and 0 is the
default. This power condi- tion modifier field in the cdb
was added after sbc3r13.</p>

<p>-n, --noflush do not perform a flush to media (e.g. like
SYNCHRONIZE CACHE does) before a variant of this utility
that limits access to the media. Using the --stop option is
an example of something that limits access to the media.
This noflush field in the cdb was added after sbc3r13.</p>

<p>-O, --old switch to older style options.</p>

<p>-p, --pc=PC where PC is the power conditions value. 0 to
15 (inclusive) are valid. Default value is 0. When --pc=0
then --eject, --load, --loej, --start and --stop are active.
Some common val- ues are 1 for the &quot;active&quot; power
condition (SBC); 2 for the idle power condition; 3 for the
standby power condition; 5 for sleep power condition (MMC);
7 for LU_CONTROL (SBC), 0xa (decimal 10) for FORCE_IDLE_0
(SBC) and 0xb (decimal 11) for FORCE_STANDBY_0 (SBC). See
recent SBC-3, MMC-5 and SAS drafts at www.t10.org for more
information.</p>

<p>-s, --start start (spin-up) the device. This sets the
START bit in the cdb. Using this option on an already
started device is harmless. In the absence of other options,
this option defaults (i.e. set the START cdb bit).</p>

<p>-S, --stop stop (spin-down) the device. This clears the
START bit in the cdb.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity. Can be
used multiple times.</p>

<p>-V, --version print out version string then exit.</p>

<p>NOTES To avoid confusion, only one of 0, 1 --eject,
--load, --start and --stop should be given.</p>

<p>There is an associated &quot;power condition&quot; mode
page (0x1a) in which timer values can be set for
transitioning to either idle or standby state after a period
of inactivity. The sdparm utility can be used to view the
power condition mode page and if required change it. If a
device is in either idle or standby power condition state
then a REQUEST SENSE command (see the sg_requests utility)
should yield a sense key of &quot;no sense&quot; and an
additional sense code of &quot;Low power con- dition
on&quot; on recent SCSI devices.</p>

<p>Ejection of removable media (e.g. sg_start --eject
/dev/hdd where the device is an ATAPI cd/dvd drive) may be
prevented by a prior SCSI PRE- VENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL
command (see sg_prevent). In this case this utility should
fail with an error generated by the device: illegal request
/ medium removal prevented. This can be overridden using
sg_prevent or, for example, sdparm --command=unlock
/dev/hdd.</p>

<p>The SCSI TEST UNIT READY command can be used to find out
whether a device is ready to transfer data. If rotating
media is stopped or still coming up to speed, then the TEST
UNIT READY command will yield a &quot;not ready&quot; sense
key and an more informative additional sense code. See the
sg_turs utility.</p>

<p>In the 2.4 series of Linux kernels the DEVICE must be a
SCSI generic (sg) device. In the 2.6 series block devices
(e.g. SCSI disks and DVD drives) can also be specified. For
example &quot;sg_start 0 /dev/sda&quot; will work in the 2.6
series kernels.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_start is 0 when it is
successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p>OLDER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS The options in this section
were the only ones available prior to sg3_utils version 1.23
. In sg3_utils version 1.23 and later these older options
can be selected by either setting the SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS
environment variable or using --old (or -O) as the first
option.</p>

<p>Note that the action of --loej is slightly different in
the older interface: when neither --start nor --stop (nor
proxies for them) are given, --loej performs an eject
operation. In the same situation the newer interface will
perform a load operation.</p>

<p>Earlier versions of sg_start had a -s option to perform
a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command before the START STOP UNIT
command was issued. According to recent SBC-2 drafts this is
done implicitly if required. Hence the -s option has been
dropped.</p>

<p>All options, other than -v and -V, can be given with a
single &quot;-&quot;. For example: &quot;sg_start -stop
/dev/sda&quot; and &quot;sg_start --stop /dev/sda&quot; are
equivalent. The single &quot;-&quot; form is for backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>0 stop (spin-down) DEVICE.</p>

<p>1 start (spin-up) DEVICE.</p>

<p>--eject stop the medium and eject it from the drive.</p>

<p>--fl=FL sets the format layer number for the disc to
&quot;jump&quot; to (defined in MMC-5).</p>

<p>-i sets the IMM bit on the START STOP UNIT command so
this utility will return immediately and not wait for the
media to spin down. Same effect as --imm=1 . The default
action (without this option or a --imm=1 option) is to wait
until the media spins down before returning.</p>

<p>--imm=0|1 when the immediate bit is 1 then this utility
returns immedi- ately after the device has received the
command. When this option is 0 (the default) then the
utility returns once the com- mand has completed its action
(i.e. it waits until the device is started or stopped).</p>

<p>--load load the medium in the drive and start it.</p>

<p>--loej sets the LOEJ bit in the START STOP UNIT cdb.
When a &quot;start&quot; operation is indicated, then a load
and start is performed. When a &quot;stop&quot; operation is
indicated, then a stop and eject is per- formed. When
neither a &quot;start&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; operation is
indicated does a stop and eject. [Note that the last action
differs from the new interface in which the option of this
name defaults to load and start.]</p>

<p>-N switch to the newer style options.</p>

<p>--mod=PC_MOD where PC_MOD is the power condition
modifier value. 0 to 15 (inclusive) are valid and 0 is the
default. This field was added after sbc3r13.</p>

<p>--noflush do not perform a flush to media (e.g. like
SYNCHRONIZE CACHE does) before a variant of this utility
that limits access to the media. Using the --stop option is
an example of something that limits access to the media.
This field was added after sbc3r13.</p>

<p>--pc=PC where PC is the power condition value (in hex).
0 to f (inclu- sive) are valid. Default value is 0.</p>

<p>--start start (spin-up) DEVICE.</p>

<p>--stop stop (spin-down) DEVICE. Same meaning as
&quot;0&quot; argument.</p>

<p>-v verbose: outputs SCSI command in hex to console
before with exe- cuting it. -vv and -vvv are also accepted
yielding greater verbosity.</p>

<p>-V print out version string then exit.</p>
