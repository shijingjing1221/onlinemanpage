zonename named on the command line.</p>

<p>These options are available:</p>

<p>--version Output version information and exit.</p>

at the lowest possible time value, the time one day after
the lowest possible time value, the times both one second
before and exactly at each detected time discontinuity, the
time at one day less than the highest possible time value,
