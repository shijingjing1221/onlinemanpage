<p>NAME scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing
information</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS scriptreplay timingfile [typescript
[divisor]]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program replays a typescript, using
timing information to ensure that output happens at the same
speed as it originally appeared when the script was
recorded.</p>

<p>The replay simply displays the information again; the
programs that were run when the typescript was being
recorded are not run again. Since the same information is
simply being displayed, scriptreplay is only guaranteed to
work properly if run on the same type of terminal the
typescript was recorded on. Otherwise, any escape characters
in the typescript may be interpreted differently by the
terminal to which scriptreplay is sending its output.</p>

<p>The timings information is what script(1) outputs to
standard error if it is run with the -t parameter.</p>

<p>By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be
named &quot;type- script&quot;, but other filenames may be
specified, as the second parameter.</p>

<p>If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a
speed-up multi- plier. For example, a speed-up of 2 makes
scriptreplay go twice as fast and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it
go ten times slower than the original session.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE % script -t 2&gt; timingfile Script started,
file is typescript % ls &lt;etc, etc&gt; % exit Script done,
file is typescript % scriptreplay timingfile</p>
