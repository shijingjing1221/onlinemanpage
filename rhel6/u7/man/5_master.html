<p>MASTER(5) MASTER(5)</p>

<p>NAME master - Postfix master process configuration file
format</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The Postfix mail system is implemented by
small number of (mostly) client commands that are invoked by
users, and by a larger number of services that run in the
background.</p>

<p>Postfix services are implemented by daemon processes.
These run in the background under control of the master(8)
process. The master.cf con- figuration file defines how a
client program connects to a service, and what daemon
program runs when a service is requested. Most daemon pro-
cesses are short-lived and terminate voluntarily after
serving max_use clients, or after inactivity for max_idle or
more units of time.</p>

<p>All daemons specified here must speak a Postfix-internal
protocol. In order to execute non-Postfix software use the
local(8), pipe(8) or spawn(8) services, or run the server
under control by inetd(8) or equivalent.</p>

<p>After changing master.cf you must execute &quot;postfix
reload&quot; to reload the configuration.</p>

<p>SYNTAX The general format of the master.cf file is as
follows:</p>

<p>&middot; Each logical line defines a single Postfix
service. Each ser- vice is identified by its name and type
as described below. When multiple lines specify the same
service name and type, only the last one is remembered.
Otherwise, the order of master.cf service definitions does
not matter.</p>

<p>&middot; Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are
ignored, as are lines whose first non-whitespace character
is a #.</p>

<p>&middot; A logical line starts with non-whitespace text.
A line that starts with whitespace continues a logical
line.</p>

<p>Each logical line consists of eight fields separated by
whitespace. These are described below in the order as they
appear in the master.cf file.</p>

<p>Where applicable a field of &quot;-&quot; requests that
the built-in default value be used. For boolean fields
specify &quot;y&quot; or &quot;n&quot; to override the
default value.</p>

<p>Service name The service name syntax depends on the
service type as described next.</p>

<p>Service type Specify one of the following service
types:</p>

<p>inet The service listens on a TCP/IP socket and is
accessible via the network.</p>

<p>The service name is specified as host:port, denoting the
host and port on which new connections should be accepted.
The host part (and colon) may be omitted. Either host or
port may be given in symbolic form (host or service name) or
in numeric form (IP address or port number). Host
information may be enclosed inside &quot;[]&quot;, but this
form is not necessary.</p>

<p>Examples: a service named 127.0.0.1:smtp or ::1:smtp
receives mail via the loopback interface only; and a ser-
vice named 10025 accepts connections on TCP port 10025 via
all interfaces configured with the inet_interfaces
parameter.</p>

<p>Note: with Postfix version 2.2 and later specify
&quot;inet_interfaces = loopback-only&quot; in main.cf,
instead of hard-coding loopback IP address information in
master.cf or in main.cf.</p>

<p>unix The service listens on a UNIX-domain socket and is
acces- sible for local clients only.</p>

<p>The service name is a pathname relative to the Postfix
queue directory (pathname controlled with the
queue_directory configuration parameter in main.cf).</p>

<p>On Solaris systems the unix type is implemented with
streams sockets.</p>

<p>fifo The service listens on a FIFO (named pipe) and is
acces- sible for local clients only.</p>

<p>The service name is a pathname relative to the Postfix
queue directory (pathname controlled with the
queue_directory configuration parameter in main.cf).</p>

<p>pass The service listens on a UNIX-domain socket,
receives one open connection (file descriptor passing) per
connection request, and is accessible to local clients
only.</p>

<p>The service name is a pathname relative to the Postfix
queue directory (pathname controlled with the
queue_directory configuration parameter in main.cf).</p>

<p>This feature is available as of Postfix version 2.5.</p>

<p>Private (default: y) Whether or not access is restricted
to the mail system. Inter- net (type inet) services cant be
private.</p>

<p>Unprivileged (default: y) Whether the service runs with
root privileges or as the owner of the Postfix system (the
owner name is controlled by the mail_owner configuration
variable in the main.cf file).</p>

<p>The local(8), pipe(8), spawn(8), and virtual(8) daemons
require privileges.</p>

<p>Chroot (default: y) Whether or not the service runs
chrooted to the mail queue directory (pathname is controlled
by the queue_directory config- uration variable in the
main.cf file).</p>

<p>Chroot should not be used with the local(8), pipe(8),
spawn(8), and virtual(8) daemons. Although the proxymap(8)
server can run chrooted, doing so defeats most of the
purpose of having that service in the first place.</p>

<p>The files in the examples/chroot-setup subdirectory of
the Post- fix source archive show set up a Postfix chroot
environment on a variety of systems. See also
BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README for issues related to running
daemons chrooted.</p>

<p>Wake up time (default: 0) Automatically wake up the
named service after the specified num- ber of seconds. The
wake up is implemented by connecting to the service and
sending a wake up request. A ? at the end of the wake-up
time field requests that no wake up events be sent before
the first time a service is used. Specify 0 for no auto-
matic wake up.</p>

<p>The pickup(8), qmgr(8) and flush(8) daemons require a
wake up timer.</p>

<p>Process limit (default: $default_process_limit) The
maximum number of processes that may execute this service
simultaneously. Specify 0 for no process count limit.</p>

<p>NOTE: Some Postfix services must be configured as a
single-pro- cess service (for example, qmgr(8)) and some
services must be configured with no process limit (for
example, cleanup(8)). These limits must not be changed.</p>

<p>Command name + arguments The command to be executed.
Characters that are special to the shell such as
&quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;|&quot; have no special meaning
here, and quotes cannot be used to protect arguments
containing whites- pace.</p>

<p>The command name is relative to the Postfix daemon
directory (pathname is controlled by the daemon_directory
configuration variable).</p>

<p>The command argument syntax for specific commands is
specified in the respective daemon manual page.</p>

<p>The following command-line options have the same effect
for all daemon programs:</p>

<p>-D Run the daemon under control by the command specified
with the debugger_command variable in the main.cf config-
uration file. See DEBUG_README for hints and tips.</p>

<p>-o name=value Override the named main.cf configuration
parameter. The parameter value can refer to other parameters
as $name etc., just like in main.cf. See postconf(5) for
syntax.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: do not specify whitespace around the
&quot;=&quot;. In parameter values, either avoid whitespace
altogether, use commas instead of spaces, or consider
overrides like &quot;-o name=$override_parameter&quot; with
$override_parameter set in main.cf.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Over-zealous use of parameter overrides makes
the Postfix configuration hard to understand and maintain.
At a certain point, it might be easier to configure mul-
tiple instances of Postfix, instead of configuring multi-
ple personalities via master.cf.</p>

<p>-v Increase the verbose logging level. Specify multiple
-v options to make a Postfix daemon process increasingly
verbose.</p>
