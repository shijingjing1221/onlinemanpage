<p>NAME ppmtoterm - convert a PPM image to a ANSI ISO 6429
ascii image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmtoterm</p>

<p>[ppmfile]</p>

<p>All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one. You may
separate an option name and its value with white space
instead of an equals sign.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>This program tries to produce an accurate representation
of a PPM image on an terminal that implements the ANSI ISO
6429 standard. It aproxi- mates colors, finding the minimum
cartesian distance between the input RGB vectors and the
ones in the generated palette. As the available color
palette is somewhat restricted, you get the best results
when the colors in the original image are few and the RGB
intensities are close to zero, half of maximum, and
maximum.</p>

<p>You can usually get good results with cartoons or images
with plain colors (no gradients). With photos, results can
vary, but are usually not very accurate.</p>

<p>The output image has one line for each row and one
character for each column of the input image. E.g. an 80
pixel by 25 pixel PPM image would fill up an 80x25 terminal
screen. Use pamscale or pamcut to make your image fit
properly on your screen.</p>

<p>The image starts at the current cursor position on the
terminal screen. Each successive row starts at Column 0 on
the screen. If you want to shift the image up or down, for
example to center it, use pnmpad on the input.</p>

<p>This program was born with the objective of displaying
nice color images on the linux console, e.g. a proper logo
at Linux boot.</p>

<p>pbmto4425 does a similar thing for black and white
images, using line drawing characters, on some
terminals.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>
