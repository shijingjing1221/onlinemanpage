<p>PROBE::SIGNAL.SEND(3stap) Signal Tapset
PROBE::SIGNAL.SEND(3stap)</p>

<p>NAME probe::signal.send.return - Signal being sent to a
process completed (deprecated in SystemTap 2.1)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS signal.send.return</p>

<p>VALUES retstr The return value to either
__group_send_sig_info, specific_send_sig_info, or
send_sigqueue</p>

<p>send2queue Indicates whether the sent signal was sent to
an existing sigqueue</p>

<p>name The name of the function used to send out the
signal</p>

<p>shared Indicates whether the sent signal is shared by
the thread group.</p>

<p>CONTEXT The signal&acute;s sender. (correct?)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Possible __group_send_sig_info and
specific_send_sig_info return values are as follows;</p>

<p>0 -- The signal is successfully sent to a process, which
means that, (1) the signal was ignored by the receiving
process, (2) this is a non-RT signal and the system already
has one queued, and (3) the signal was successfully added to
the sigqueue of the receiving process.</p>

<p>-EAGAIN -- The sigqueue of the receiving process is
overflowing, the signal was RT, and the signal was sent by a
user using something other than kill.</p>

<p>Possible send_group_sigqueue and send_sigqueue return
values are as follows;</p>

<p>0 -- The signal was either successfully added into the
sigqueue of the receiving process, or a SI_TIMER entry is
already queued (in which case, the overrun count will be
simply incremented).</p>

<p>1 -- The signal was ignored by the receiving
process.</p>

<p>-1 -- (send_sigqueue only) The task was marked exiting,
allowing * posix_timer_event to redirect it to the group
leader.</p>
