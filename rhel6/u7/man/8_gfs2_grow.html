<p>NAME gfs2_grow - Expand a GFS2 filesystem</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gfs2_grow [OPTION]...
&lt;DEVICE|MOUNTPOINT&gt;...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gfs2_grow is used to expand a GFS2
filesystem after the device upon which the filesystem
resides has also been expanded. By running gfs2_grow on a
GFS2 filesystem, you are requesting that any spare space
between the current end of the filesystem and the end of the
device is filled with a newly initialized GFS2 filesystem
extension. When this operation is complete, the resource
group index for the filesystem is updated so that all nodes
in the cluster can use the extra storage space that has been
added.</p>

<p>You may only run gfs2_grow on a mounted filesystem;
expansion of unmounted filesystems is not supported. You
only need to run gfs2_grow on one node in the cluster. All
the other nodes will see the expansion has occurred and
automatically start to use the newly available space.</p>

<p>You must be superuser to execute gfs2_grow. The
gfs2_grow tool tries to prevent you from corrupting your
filesystem by checking as many of the likely problems as it
can. When expanding a filesystem, only the last step of
updating the resource index affects the currently mounted
filesystem and so failure part way through the expansion
process should leave your filesystem in its original
unexpanded state.</p>

<p>You can run gfs2_grow with the -T flag to get a display
of the current state of a mounted GFS2 filesystem.</p>

<p>The gfs2_grow tool uses the resource group (RG) size
that was origi- nally calculated when mkfs.gfs2 was done.
This allows tools like fsck.gfs2 to better ensure the
integrity of the file system. Since the new free space often
does not lie on even boundaries based on that RG size, there
may be some unused space on the device after gfs2_grow is
run.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -D Print out debugging information about the
filesystem layout.</p>

<p>-h Prints out a short usage message and exits.</p>

<p>-q Be quiet. Dont print anything.</p>

<p>-T Test. Do all calculations, but do not write any data
to the disk and do not expand the filesystem. This is used
to discover what the tool would have done were it run
without this flag.</p>

<p>-V Version. Print out version information, then
exit.</p>

<p>BUGS There is no way to shrink a GFS2 filesystem.</p>
