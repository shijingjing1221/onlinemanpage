<p>NAME dhclient-script - DHCP client network configuration
script</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The DHCP client network configuration script
is invoked from time to time by dhclient(8). This script is
used by the dhcp client to set each interfaces initial
configuration prior to requesting an address, to test the
address once it has been offered, and to set the inter- face
s final configuration once a lease has been acquired. If no
lease is acquired, the script is used to test predefined
leases, if any, and also called once if no valid lease can
be identified.</p>

<p>This script is not meant to be customized by the end
user. If local customizations are needed, they should be
possible using the enter and exit hooks provided (see HOOKS
for details). These hooks will allow the user to override
the default behaviour of the client in creating a
/etc/resolv.conf file, and to handle DHCP options not
handled by default.</p>

<p>No standard client script exists for some operating
systems, even though the actual client may work, so a
pioneering user may well need to create a new script or
modify an existing one. In general, cus- tomizations
specific to a particular computer should be done in the
/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file. If you find that you can t
make such a customization without customizing
/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf or using the enter and exit hooks,
please submit a bug report.</p>

<p>HOOKS When it starts, the client script first defines a
shell function, make_resolv_conf , which is later used to
create the /etc/resolv.conf file. To override the default
behaviour, redefine this function in the enter hook
script.</p>

<p>On after defining the make_resolv_conf function, the
client script checks for the presence of an executable
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks script, and if present, it
invokes the script inline, using the Bourne shell . command.
The entire environment documented under OPERATION is
available to this script, which may modify the environment
if needed to change the behaviour of the script. If an error
occurs during the execution of the script, it can set the
exit_status variable to a nonzero value, and
/sbin/dhclient-script will exit with that error code
immediately after the client script exits.</p>

<p>After all processing has completed,
/sbin/dhclient-script checks for the presence of an
executable /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks script, which if
present is invoked using the . command. The exit status of
dhclient-script will be passed to dhclient-exit-hooks in the
exit_sta- tus shell variable, and will always be zero if the
script succeeded at the task for which it was invoked. The
rest of the environment as described previously for
dhclient-enter-hooks is also present. The
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks script can modify the valid of
exit_sta- tus to change the exit status of
dhclient-script.</p>

<p>Immediately after dhclient brings an interface UP with a
new IP address, subnet mask, and routes, in the REBOOT/BOUND
states, it will check for the existence of an executable
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-up-hooks script, and source it if found.
This script can handle DHCP options in the environment that
are not handled by default. A per-interface.
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-up-hooks script will override the
generic script and be sourced when interface $IF has been
brought up.</p>

<p>Immediately before dhclient brings an interface DOWN,
removing its IP address, subnet mask, and routes, in the
STOP/RELEASE states, it will check for the existence of an
executable /etc/dhcp/dhclient-down-hooks script, and source
it if found. This script can handle DHCP options in the
environment that are not handled by default. A per-interface
/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-down-hooks script will override the
generic script and be sourced when interface $IF is about to
be brought down.</p>

<p>OPERATION When dhclient needs to invoke the client
configuration script, it defines a set of variables in the
environment, and then invokes /sbin/dhclient-script. In all
cases, $reason is set to the name of the reason why the
script has been invoked. The following reasons are currently
defined: MEDIUM, PREINIT, BOUND, RENEW, REBIND, REBOOT,
EXPIRE, FAIL, STOP, RELEASE, NBI and TIMEOUT.</p>

<p>MEDIUM The DHCP client is requesting that an interface s
media type be set. The interface name is passed in
$interface, and the media type is passed in $medium.</p>

<p>PREINIT The DHCP client is requesting that an interface
be configured as required in order to send packets prior to
receiving an actual address. For clients which use the BSD
socket library, this means configuring the interface with an
IP address of 0.0.0.0 and a broadcast address of
255.255.255.255. For other clients, it may be possible to
simply con- figure the interface up without actually giving
it an IP address at all. The interface name is passed in
$interface, and the media type in $medium.</p>

<p>If an IP alias has been declared in dhclient.conf, its
address will be passed in $alias_ip_address, and that ip
alias should be deleted from the interface, along with any
routes to it.</p>

<p>BOUND The DHCP client has done an initial binding to a
new address. The new ip address is passed in
$new_ip_address, and the interface name is passed in
$interface. The media type is passed in $medium. Any options
acquired from the server are passed using the option name
described in dhcp-options, except that dashes (-) are
replaced by underscores (_) in order to make valid shell
variables, and the vari- able names start with new_. So for
example, the new subnet mask would be passed in
$new_subnet_mask.</p>

<p>Before actually configuring the address, dhclient-script
should somehow ARP for it and exit with a nonzero status if
it receives a reply. In this case, the client will send a
DHCPDECLINE message to the server and acquire a different
address. This may also be done in the RENEW, REBIND, or
REBOOT states, but is not required, and indeed may not be
desirable.</p>

<p>When a binding has been completed, a lot of network
parameters are likely to need to be set up. A new
/etc/resolv.conf needs to be cre- ated, using the values of
$new_domain_name and $new_domain_name_servers (which may
list more than one server, separated by spaces). A default
route should be set using $new_routers, and static routes
may need to be set up using $new_static_routes.</p>

<p>If an IP alias has been declared, it must be set up
here. The alias IP address will be written as
$alias_ip_address, and other DHCP options that are set for
the alias (e.g., subnet mask) will be passed in vari- ables
named as described previously except starting with $alias_
instead of $new_. Care should be taken that the alias IP
address not be used if it is identical to the bound IP
address ($new_ip_address), since the other alias parameters
may be incorrect in this case.</p>

<p>RENEW When a binding has been renewed, the script is
called as in BOUND, except that in addition to all the
variables starting with $new_, there is another set of
variables starting with $old_. Persistent settings that may
have changed need to be deleted - for example, if a local
route to the bound address is being configured, the old
local route should be deleted. If the default route has
changed, the old default route should be deleted. If the
static routes have changed, the old ones should be deleted.
Otherwise, processing can be done as with BOUND.</p>

<p>REBIND The DHCP client has rebound to a new DHCP server.
This can be handled as with RENEW, except that if the IP
address has changed, the ARP table should be cleared.</p>

<p>REBOOT The DHCP client has successfully reacquired its
old address after a reboot. This can be processed as with
BOUND.</p>

<p>EXPIRE The DHCP client has failed to renew its lease or
acquire a new one, and the lease has expired. The IP address
must be relinquished, and all related parameters should be
deleted, as in RENEW and REBIND.</p>

<p>FAIL The DHCP client has been unable to contact any DHCP
servers, and any leases that have been tested have not
proved to be valid. The parame- ters from the last lease
tested should be deconfigured. This can be handled in the
same way as EXPIRE.</p>

<p>STOP The dhclient has been informed to shut down
gracefully, the dhclient- script should unconfigure or
shutdown the interface as appropriate.</p>

<p>RELEASE The dhclient has been executed using the -r
flag, indicating that the administrator wishes it to release
its lease(s). dhclient-script should unconfigure or shutdown
the interface.</p>

<p>NBI No-Broadcast-Interfaces...dhclient was unable to
find any interfaces upon which it believed it should
commence DHCP. What dhclient-script should do in this
situation is entirely up to the implementor.</p>

<p>TIMEOUT The DHCP client has been unable to contact any
DHCP servers. However, an old lease has been identified, and
its parameters have been passed in as with BOUND. The client
configuration script should test these parameters and, if it
has reason to believe they are valid, should exit with a
value of zero. If not, it should exit with a nonzero
value.</p>

<p>The usual way to test a lease is to set up the network
as with REBIND (since this may be called to test more than
one lease) and then ping the first router defined in
$routers. If a response is received, the lease must be valid
for the network to which the interface is currently
connected. It would be more complete to try to ping all of
the routers listed in $new_routers, as well as those listed
in $new_static_routes, but current scripts do not do
this.</p>

<p>FILES Each operating system should generally have its
own script file, although the script files for similar
operating systems may be similar or even identical. The
script files included in Internet Systems Con- sortium DHCP
distribution appear in the distribution tree under
client/scripts, and bear the names of the operating systems
on which they are intended to work.</p>

<p>BUGS If more than one interface is being used, theres no
obvious way to avoid clashes between server-supplied
configuration parameters - for example, the stock
dhclient-script rewrites /etc/resolv.conf. If more than one
interface is being configured, /etc/resolv.conf will be
repeatedly initialized to the values provided by one server,
and then the other. Assuming the information provided by
both servers is valid, this shouldnt cause any real
problems, but it could be confus- ing.</p>
