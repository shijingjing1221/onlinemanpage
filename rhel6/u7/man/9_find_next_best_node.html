FIND_NEXT_BEST_NODE(9)</p>

<p>NAME find_next_best_node - find the next node that
should appear in a given node&acute;s fallback list</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int find_next_best_node(int node, nodemask_t *
used_node_mask);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS node node whose fallback list we&acute;re
appending</p>

<p>used_node_mask nodemask_t of already used nodes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION We use a number of factors to determine
which is the next node that should appear on a given
node&acute;s fallback list. The node should not have
appeared already in node&acute;s fallback list, and it
should be the next closest node according to the distance
array (which contains arbitrary distance values from each
node to each node in the system), and should also prefer
nodes with no CPUs, since presumably they&acute;ll have very
little allocation pressure on them otherwise. It returns -1
if no node is found.</p>
