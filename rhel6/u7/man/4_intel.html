<p>NAME intel - Intel integrated graphics chipsets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier
&quot;devname&quot; Driver &quot;intel&quot; ...
EndSection</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION intel is an Xorg driver for Intel integrated
graphics chipsets. The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and
24. All visual types are sup- ported in depth 8. For the
i810/i815 other depths support the True- Color and
DirectColor visuals. For the i830M and later, only the True-
Color visual is supported for depths greater than 8. The
driver sup- ports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct
Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16 for the
i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED HARDWARE intel supports the i810, i810-DC100,
i810e, i815, i830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 915GM,
945G, 945GM, 965G, 965Q, 946GZ, 965GM, 945GME, G33, Q33,
Q35, G35, GM45, G45, Q45, G43, G41 chipsets, and Pineview-M
in Atom N400 series, Pineview-D in Atom D400/D500
series.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION DETAILS Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for
general configuration details. This section only covers
configuration details specific to this driver.</p>

<p>The Intel 8xx and 9xx families of integrated graphics
chipsets have a unified memory architecture meaning that
system memory is used as video RAM. For the i810 and i815
family of chipsets, operating system sup- port for
allocating system memory is required in order to use this
driver. For the 830M and later, this is required in order
for the driver to use more video RAM than has been
pre-allocated at boot time by the BIOS. This is usually
achieved with an &quot;agpgart&quot; or &quot;agp&quot; ker-
nel driver. Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris
have such kernel drivers available.</p>

<p>By default, the i810/i815 will use 8 MB of system memory
for graphics if AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128 MB, 16 MB
if &lt; 192 MB or 24 MB if higher. Use the VideoRam option
to change the default value.</p>

<p>For the 830M and later, the driver will automatically
size its memory allocation according to the features it will
support. Therefore, the VideoRam option, which in the past
had been necessary to allow more than some small amount of
memory to be allocated, is now ignored.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported</p>

<p>Option &quot;ColorKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay
key.</p>

<p>Default: undefined.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DRI&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DRI support.</p>

<p>Default: DRI is enabled for configurations where it is
sup- ported.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the i810
and i815 chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;CacheLines&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
allows the user to change the amount of graphics memory used
for 2D acceleration and video when XAA acceleration is
enabled. Decreasing this amount leaves more for 3D textures.
Increasing it can improve 2D performance at the expense of
3D performance.</p>

<p>Default: depends on the resolution, depth, and available
video memory. The driver attempts to allocate space for at 3
screen- fuls of pixmaps plus an HD-sized XV video. The
default used for a specific configuration can be found by
examining the Xorg log file.</p>

<p>Option &quot;DDC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable or
enable DDC support.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Dac6Bit&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable or
disable 6-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>

<p>Default: 8-bits per RGB for 8-bit modes.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvMCSurfaces&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option enables XvMC. The integer parameter specifies the
number of surfaces to use. Valid values are 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Default: XvMC is disabled.</p>

<p>VideoRam integer This option specifies the amount of
system memory to use for graphics, in KB.</p>

<p>The default is 8192 if AGP allocable memory is &lt; 128
MB, 16384 if &lt; 192 MB, 24576 if higher. DRI require at
least a value of 16384. Higher values may give better 3D
performance, at expense of available system memory.</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration.</p>

<p>Default: acceleration is enabled.</p>

<p>The following driver Options are supported for the 830M
and later chipsets:</p>

<p>Option &quot;NoAccel&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable acceleration.</p>

<p>Default: acceleration is enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;string&quot; Select
acceleration method. There are a couple of backends
available for accelerating the DDX. &quot;UXA&quot; (Unified
Acceleration Architecture) is the mature backend that was
introduced to sup- port the GEM driver model. It is in the
process of being super- seded by &quot;SNA&quot;
(Sandybridge s New Acceleration). Until that pro- cess is
complete, the ability to choose which backend to use remains
for backwards compatibility. In addition, there are a pair
of sub-options to limit the acceleration for debugging use.
Specify &quot;off&quot; to disable all acceleration, or
&quot;blt&quot; to disable render acceleration and only use
the BLT engine.</p>

<p>Default: use SNA (render acceleration)</p>

<p>Option &quot;TearFree&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Disable
or enable TearFree updates. This option forces X to per-
form all rendering to a backbuffer prior to updating the
actual display. It requires an extra memory allocation the
same size as a framebuffer, the occasional extra copy, and
requires Damage tracking. Thus enabling TearFree requires
more memory and is slower (reduced throughput) and
introduces a small amount of output latency, but it should
not impact input latency. However, the update to the screen
is then performed synchronously with the vertical refresh of
the display so that the entire update is completed before
the display starts its refresh. That is only one frame is
ever visible, preventing an unsightly tear between two
visible and differing frames. Note that this replicates what
the compositing manager should be doing, so it is not
advisable to enable both. However, some compositing managers
do cause tearing, and if the outputs are rotated, there may
will still be tearing without TearFree enabled.</p>

<p>Default: TearFree is disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;ReprobeOutputs&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Disable or enable rediscovery of connected displays during
server startup. As the kernel driver loads it scans for con-
nected displays and configures a console spanning those
outputs. When the X server starts, we then take the list of
connected displays and framebuffer layout and use that for
the initial configuration. Sometimes, not all displays are
correctly detected by the kernel and so it is useful in a
few circum- stances for X to force the kernel to reprobe all
displays when it starts. To make the X server recheck the
status of connected displays, set the
&quot;ReprobeOutputs&quot; option to true. Please do file a
bug for any circumstances which require this workaround.</p>

<p>Default: reprobing is disabled for a faster startup.</p>

<p>Option &quot;VideoKey&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This is
the same as the &quot;ColorKey&quot; option described above.
It is provided for compatibility with most other
drivers.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvPreferOverlay&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Make hardware overlay be the first XV adaptor. The overlay
behaves incorrectly in the presence of compositing, but some
prefer it due to it syncing to vblank in the absence of com-
positing. While most XV-using applications have options to
select which XV adaptor to use, this option can be used to
place the overlay first for applications which dont have
options for selecting adaptors.</p>

<p>Default: Textured video adaptor is preferred.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Backlight&quot; &quot;string&quot; Override
the probed backlight control interface. Sometimes the
automatically selected backlight interface may not
correspond to the correct, or simply most useful, interface
available on the system. This allows you to override that
choice by specifying the entry under /sys/class/backlight to
use.</p>

<p>Default: Automatic selection.</p>

<p>Option &quot;FallbackDebug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Enable printing of debugging information on acceleration
fall- backs to the server log.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugFlushBatches&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Flush the batch buffer after every single operation.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugFlushCaches&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
Include an MI_FLUSH at the end of every batch buffer to
force data to be flushed out of cache and into memory before
the com- pletion of the batch.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;DebugWait&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Wait
for the completion of every batch buffer before continuing,
i.e. perform synchronous rendering.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;VSync&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This option
controls the use of commands to synchronise rendering with
the vertical refresh of the display. Some rendering commands
have the option to be performed in a &quot;tear-free&quot;
fashion by stalling the GPU to wait for the display to be
outside of the region to be updated. This slows down all
rendering, and historically has been the source of many GPU
hangs.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;PageFlip&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option controls the use of commands to flip the scanout
address on a VBlank. This is used by glXSwap- Buffers to
efficiently perform the back-to-front exchange at the end of
a frame without incurring the penalty of a copy, or stalling
the render pipeline (the flip is per- formed asynchronrously
to the render command stream by the display engine).
However, it has historically been the source of many GPU
hangs.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;SwapbuffersWait&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
This option controls the behavior of glXSwapBuffers and
glXCopySubBufferMESA calls by GL applications. If enabled,
the calls will avoid tearing by making sure the display
scanline is outside of the area to be copied before the copy
occurs. If disabled, no scanline syn- chronization is
performed, meaning tearing will likely occur.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;TripleBuffer&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option enables the use of a third buffer for page- flipping.
The third buffer allows applications to run at vrefresh
rates even if they occasionally fail to swap- buffers on
time. The effect of such missed swaps is the output jitters
between 60fps and 30fps, and in the worst case appears
frame-locked to 30fps. The disadvantage of triple buffering
is that there is an extra frame of latency, due to the
pre-rendered frame sitting in the swap queue, between input
and any display update.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Tiling&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option controls whether memory buffers for Pixmaps are
allocated in tiled mode. In most cases (especially for
complex rendering), tiling dramatically improves per-
formance.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;LinearFramebuffer&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
This option controls whether the memory for the scanout
(also known as the front or frame buffer) is allocated in
linear memory. A tiled framebuffer is required for power
conservation features, but for certain system configura-
tions you may wish to override this and force a linear
layout.</p>

<p>Default: disabled</p>

<p>Option &quot;RelaxedFencing&quot; &quot;boolean&quot;
This option controls whether we attempt to allocate the
minimal amount of memory required for the buffers. The
reduction in working set has a substantial improvement on
system performance. However, this has been demonstrate to be
buggy on older hardware (845-865 and 915-945, but ok on
PineView and later) so on those chipsets defaults to
off.</p>

<p>Default: Enabled for G33 (includes PineView), and later,
class machines.</p>

<p>Option &quot;XvMC&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; Enable XvMC
driver. Current support MPEG2 MC on 915/945 and G33 series.
User should provide absolute path to libIntelXvMC.so in
XvMCConfig file.</p>

<p>Default: Disabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Throttle&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option controls whether the driver periodically waits for
pending drawing operations to complete. Throt- tling ensures
that the GPU does not lag too far behind the CPU and thus
noticeable delays in user responsible at the cost of
throughput performance.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;HotPlug&quot; &quot;boolean&quot; This
option controls whether the driver automatically notifies
applications when monitors are connected or dis-
connected.</p>

<p>Default: enabled.</p>

<p>Option &quot;Virtualheads&quot; &quot;integer&quot; This
option controls specifies the number of fake outputs to
create in addition to the normal outputs detected on your
hardware. These outputs cannot be assigned to the regular
displays attached to the GPU, but do otherwise act as any
other xrandr output and share a portion of the regular
framebuffer. One use case for these extra heads is for
extending your desktop onto a discrete GPU using the
Bumblebee project. However, the recommendation here is to
use PRIME instead to create a single Xserver that can
addresses and coordinate between multiple GPUs.</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>Option &quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;string&quot;</p>

<p>Specify the randr output(s) to use with zaphod mode for
a particular driver instance. If you this option you must
use it with all instances of the driver For example: Option
&quot;ZaphodHeads&quot; &quot;LVDS1,VGA1&quot; will assign
xrandr outputs LVDS1 and VGA0 to this instance of the
driver.</p>

<p>OUTPUT CONFIGURATION On 830M and better chipsets, the
driver supports runtime config- uration of detected outputs.
You can use the xrandr tool to control outputs on the
command line as follows:</p>

<p>xrandr --output output --set property value</p>

<p>Note that you may need to quote property and value
arguments that contain spaces. Each output listed below may
have one or more properties associated with it (like a
binary EDID block if one is found). Some outputs have unique
properties which are described below. See the
&quot;MULTIHEAD CONFIGURATIONS&quot; section below for
additional information.</p>

<p>VGA VGA output port (typically exposed via an HD15
connector).</p>

<p>LVDS Low Voltage Differential Signalling output
(typically a laptop LCD panel). Available properties:</p>

<p>BACKLIGHT - current backlight level (adjustable) By
adjusting the BACKLIGHT property, the brightness on the LVDS
output can be adjusted. In some cases, this property may be
unavailable (for example if your platform uses an external
microcontroller to control the back- light).</p>

<p>scaling mode - control LCD panel scaling mode When the
currently selected display mode differs from the native
panel resolution, various scaling options are available.
These include</p>

<p>Center Simply center the image on-screen without
scaling. This is the only scaling mode that guarantees a
one-to-one correspondence between native and dis- played
pixels, but some portions of the panel may be unused
(so-called &quot;letterboxing&quot;).</p>

<p>Full aspect Scale the image as much as possible while
preserv- ing aspect ratio. Pixels may not be displayed one-
to-one (there may be some blurriness). Some por- tions of
the panel may be unused if the aspect ratio of the selected
mode does not match that of the panel.</p>

<p>Full Scale the image to the panel size without regard to
aspect ratio. This is the only mode which guar- antees that
every pixel of the panel will be used. But the displayed
image may be distorted by stretching either horizontally or
vertically, and pixels may not be displayed one-to-one
(there may be some blurriness).</p>

<p>The precise names of these options may differ depending
on the kernel video driver, (but the functionality should be
similar). See the output of xrandr --prop for a list of
currently avail- able scaling modes.</p>

<p>TV Integrated TV output. Available properties
include:</p>

<p>BOTTOM, RIGHT, TOP, LEFT - margins Adjusting these
properties allows you to control the placement of your TV
output buffer on the screen. The options with the same name
can also be set in xorg.conf with integer value.</p>

<p>BRIGHTNESS - TV brightness, range 0-255 Adjust TV
brightness, default value is 128.</p>

<p>CONTRAST - TV contrast, range 0-255 Adjust TV contrast,
default value is 1.0 in chipset spe- cific format.</p>

<p>SATURATION - TV saturation, range 0-255 Adjust TV
saturation, default value is 1.0 in chipset specific
format.</p>

<p>HUE - TV hue, range 0-255 Adjust TV hue, default value
is 0.</p>

<p>TV_FORMAT - output standard This property allows you to
control the output standard used on your TV output port. You
can select between NTSC-M, NTSC-443, NTSC-J, PAL-M, PAL-N,
and PAL.</p>

<p>TV_Connector - connector type This config option should
be added to xorg.conf TV moni- tors section, it allows you
to force the TV output con- nector type, which bypass load
detect and TV will always be taken as connected. You can
select between S-Video, Composite and Component.</p>

<p>TMDS-1 First DVI SDVO output</p>

<p>TMDS-2 Second DVI SDVO output</p>

<p>TMDS-1 , TMDS-2 , HDMI-1 , HDMI-2 DVI/HDMI outputs.
Avaliable common properties include:</p>

<p>BROADCAST_RGB - method used to set RGB color range
Adjusting this property allows you to set RGB color range on
each channel in order to match HDTV requirment(default 0 for
full range). Setting 1 means RGB color range is 16-235, 0
means RGB color range is 0-255 on each channel. (Full range
is 0-255, not 16-235)</p>

<p>SDVO and DVO TV outputs are not supported by the driver
at this time.</p>

<p>See xorg.conf(5) for information on associating Monitor
sections with these outputs for configuration. Associating
Monitor sections with each output can be helpful if you need
to ignore a specific output, for example, or statically
configure an extended desktop monitor layout.</p>

<p>MULTIHEAD CONFIGURATIONS The number of independent
outputs is dictated by the number of CRTCs (in X parlance) a
given chip supports. Most recent Intel chips have two CRTCs,
meaning that two separate framebuffers can be displayed
simultaneously, in an extended desktop configura- tion. If a
chip supports more outputs than it has CRTCs (say local flat
panel, VGA and TV in the case of many outputs), two of the
outputs will have to be &quot;cloned&quot;, meaning that
they dis- play the same framebuffer contents (or one
displays a subset of anothers framebuffer if the modes arent
equal).</p>

<p>You can use the &quot;xrandr&quot; tool, or various
desktop utilities, to change your output configuration at
runtime. To statically con- figure your outputs, you can use
the &quot;Monitor-&lt;type&gt;&quot; options along with
additional monitor sections in your xorg.conf to cre- ate
your screen topology. The example below puts the VGA output
to the right of the builtin laptop screen, both running at
1024x768.</p>

<p>Section &quot;Monitor&quot; Identifier &quot;Laptop

&quot;0 0&quot; EndSection</p>

<p>Section &quot;Monitor&quot; Identifier &quot;Some Random
CRT&quot; Option &quot;Position&quot; &quot;1024 0&quot;
Option &quot;RightOf&quot; &quot;Laptop FoodBar Internal

<p>Section &quot;Device&quot; Driver &quot;intel&quot;
Option &quot;monitor-LVDS&quot; &quot;Laptop FooBar Internal
Display&quot; Option &quot;monitor-VGA&quot; &quot;Some
Random CRT&quot; EndSection</p>

<p>TEXTURED VIDEO ATTRIBUTES The driver supports the
following X11 Xv attributes for Textured Video. You can use
the &quot;xvattr&quot; tool to query/set those attributes at
runtime.</p>

<p>XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK XV_SYNC_TO_VBLANK is used to control
whether textured adapter synchronizes the screen update to
the vblank to eliminate tear- ing. It is a Boolean attribute
with values of 0 (never sync) or 1 (always sync). An
historic value of -1 (sync for large windows only) will now
be interpreted as 1, (since the current approach for sync is
not costly even with small video windows).</p>

<p>XV_BRIGHTNESS XV_CONTRAST REPORTING BUGS The
xf86-video-intel driver is part of the X.Org and Freedesk-
top.org umbrella projects. Details on bug reporting can be
found at http://www.intellinuxgraph-
ics.org/how_to_report_bug.html. Mailing lists are also
commonly used to report experiences and ask questions about
configuration and other topics. See lists.freedesktop.org
for more informa- tion (the xorg@lists.freedesktop.org
mailing list is the most appropriate place to ask X.Org and
driver related questions).</p>
