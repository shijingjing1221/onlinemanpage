<p>rlm_passwd(5) FreeRADIUS Module rlm_passwd(5)</p>

<p>NAME rlm_passwd - FreeRADIUS Module</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The rlm_passwd module provides authorization
via files similar in for- mat to /etc/passwd.</p>

<p>The lm_passwd module allows you to retrieve any account
information from any files with passwd-like format
(/etc/passwd, /etc/group, smb- passwd, .htpasswd, etc).
Every field of the file may be mapped to a RADIUS attribute,
with one of the fields used as a key.</p>

<p>The module reads the file when it initializes, and
caches the data in memory. As a result, it does not support
dynamic updates of the files (the server has to be HUPd),
but it is very fast, even for files with thousands of
lines.</p>

<p>The configuration item(s):</p>

<p>filename The path to the file.</p>

<p>delimiter = &quot;:&quot; The character to use as a
delimiter between fields. The default is &quot;:&quot;</p>

<p>hashsize The size of the hashtable. If 0, then the
passwords are not cached and the passwd file is parsed for
every request. We do not recommend such a configuration. A
larger hashsize means less probability of collision and
faster search in hashtable. Having a hashsize in the range
of 30-100% of the number of passwd file records is
reasonable.</p>

<p>allowmultiplekeys If set to yes, and more than one
record in file matches the request, then the attributes from
all records will be used. If set to no (the default) the
module will warn about duplicated records.</p>

<p>ignorenislike If set to yes, then all records from the
file beginning with the + sign will be ignored. The default
is no.</p>

<p>format The format of the fields in the file, given as an
example line from the file, with the content of the fields
as the RADIUS attributes which the fields map to. The fields
are seperated by the : character.</p>

<p>The key field is signified by being preceded with a *
character, which indicates that the field has only one key,
like the /etc/passwd file. The key field may instead be
preceded with *, , which indicates that the field has
multiple possible keys, like the /etc/group file.</p>

<p>The other fields signify RADIUS attributes which, by
default, are added to the configuration items for a
request.</p>

<p>To add an attribute to the request (as though it was
sent by the NAS), prefix the attribute name in the
&quot;format&quot; string with the ~ charac- ter.</p>

<p>To add an attribute to the reply (to be sent back to the
NAS) prefix the attribute name in the &quot;format&quot;
string with the = character.</p>

<p>ignoreempty This configuration item defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;. If there is no value for the attribute,
then the attribute is not added. By setting this value to
&quot;no&quot;, you can force the attribute to be added,
even if there is no value.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES format = &quot;My-Group:::*,User-Name&quot;</p>

<p>Parse a file similar to the /etc/group file. An entry
matches a request when the name in a User-Name attribute
exists in the comma-seperated list of a line in the file.
When an entry matches, a &quot;My-Group&quot; attribute will
be created and added to the configuration items for the
request. The value of that attribute will be taken from the
first field of the matching line in the file.</p>

<p>The &quot;:::&quot; in the format string means that
there are extra two fields in the line, in between the group
name and list of user names. Those fields do not map to any
RADIUS attribute, and are therefore ignored.</p>

<p>For this example to work in practice, you will have to
add the My-Group attribute to the dictionary file. See the
dictionary manual page for details on how this may be
done.</p>

<p>format = &quot;~My-Group:::*,User-Name&quot;</p>

<p>Similar to the previous entry, except the My-Group
attribute is added to the request, as though it was sent by
the NAS.</p>
