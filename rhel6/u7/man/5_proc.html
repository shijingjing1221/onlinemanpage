<p>PROC(5) Linux Programmer s Manual PROC(5)</p>

<p>NAME proc - process information pseudo-file system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The proc file system is a pseudo-file system
which is used as an inter- face to kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at /proc. Most of it is read-only,
but some files allow kernel variables to be changed.</p>

<p>The following outline gives a quick tour through the
/proc hierarchy.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid] There is a numerical subdirectory for each
running process; the subdirectory is named by the process
ID. Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/auxv (since 2.6.0-test7) This contains the
contents of the ELF interpreter information passed to the
process at exec time. The format is one unsigned long ID
plus one unsigned long value for each entry. The last entry
contains two zeros.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/cmdline This holds the complete command line
for the process, unless the process is a zombie. In the
latter case, there is nothing in this file: that is, a read
on this file will return 0 charac- ters. The command-line
arguments appear in this file as a set of null-separated
strings, with a further null byte (&rsquo; &rsquo;) after
the last string.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter (since kernel 2.6.23) See
core(5).</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/cpuset (since kernel 2.6.12) See
cpuset(7).</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/cwd This is a symbolic link to the current
working directory of the process. To find out the current
working directory of process 20, for instance, you can do
this:</p>

<p>$ cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd</p>

<p>Note that the pwd command is often a shell built-in, and
might not work properly. In bash(1), you may use pwd -P.</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this
symbolic link are not available if the main thread has
already terminated (typically by calling
pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/environ This file contains the environment
for the process. The entries are separated by null bytes
(&rsquo; &rsquo;), and there may be a null byte at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would
do:</p>

<p>$ (cat /proc/1/environ; echo) | tr 000&rsquo;
n&rsquo;</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/exe Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is
a symbolic link contain- ing the actual pathname of the
executed command. This symbolic link can be dereferenced
normally; attempting to open it will open the executable.
You can even type /proc/[pid]/exe to run another copy of the
same executable as is being run by process [pid]. In a
multithreaded process, the contents of this sym- bolic link
are not available if the main thread has already ter-
minated (typically by calling pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>Under Linux 2.0 and earlier /proc/[pid]/exe is a pointer
to the binary which was executed, and appears as a symbolic
link. A readlink(2) call on this file under Linux 2.0
returns a string in the format:</p>

<p>[device]:inode</p>

<p>For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device
major 03 (IDE, MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition
on the first drive).</p>

<p>find(1) with the -inum option can be used to locate the
file.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/fd This is a subdirectory containing one
entry for each file which the process has open, named by its
file descriptor, and which is a symbolic link to the actual
file. Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2
standard error, etc.</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this
directory are not available if the main thread has already
terminated (typi- cally by calling pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>Programs that will take a filename as a command-line
argument, but will not take input from standard input if no
argument is supplied, or that write to a file named as a
command-line argu- ment, but will not send their output to
standard output if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless
be made to use standard input or standard out using
/proc/[pid]/fd. For example, assum- ing that -i is the flag
designating an input file and -o is the flag designating an
output file:</p>

<p>$ foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</p>

<p>and you have a working filter.</p>

<p>/proc/self/fd/N is approximately the same as /dev/fd/N
in some Unix and Unix-like systems. Most Linux MAKEDEV
scripts symboli- cally link /dev/fd to /proc/self/fd, in
fact.</p>

<p>Most systems provide symbolic links /dev/stdin,
/dev/stdout, and /dev/stderr, which respectively link to the
files 0, 1, and 2 in /proc/self/fd. Thus the example command
above could be written as:</p>

<p>$ foobar -i /dev/stdin -o /dev/stdout ...</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/ (since kernel 2.6.22) This is a
subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor. The con-
tents of each file can be read to obtain information about
the corresponding file descriptor, for example:</p>

<p>$ cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4 pos: 1000 flags: 01002002</p>

<p>The pos field is a decimal number showing the current
file off- set. The flags field is an octal number that
displays the file access mode and file status flags (see
open(2)).</p>

<p>The files in this directory are readable only by the
owner of the process.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/limits (since kernel 2.6.24) This file
displays the soft limit, hard limit, and units of mea-
surement for each of the processs resource limits (see getr-
limit(2)). The file is protected to only allow reading by
the real UID of the process.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/maps A file containing the currently mapped
memory regions and their access permissions.</p>

<p>The format is:</p>

<p>address perms offset dev inode pathname
08048000-08056000 r-xp 00000000 03:0c 64593 /usr/sbin/gpm
08056000-08058000 rw-p 0000d000 03:0c 64593 /usr/sbin/gpm
08058000-0805b000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 40000000-40013000
r-xp 00000000 03:0c 4165 /lib/ld-2.2.4.so 40013000-40015000
rw-p 00012000 03:0c 4165 /lib/ld-2.2.4.so 4001f000-40135000
r-xp 00000000 03:0c 45494 /lib/libc-2.2.4.so
40135000-4013e000 rw-p 00115000 03:0c 45494
/lib/libc-2.2.4.so 4013e000-40142000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0</p>

<p>where &quot;address&quot; is the address space in the
process that it occupies, &quot;perms&quot; is a set of
permissions:</p>

<p>r = read w = write x = execute s = shared p = private
(copy on write)</p>

<p>&quot;offset&quot; is the offset into the file/whatever,
&quot;dev&quot; is the device (major:minor), and
&quot;inode&quot; is the inode on that device. 0 indicates
that no inode is associated with the memory region, as the
case would be with BSS (uninitialized data).</p>

<p>Under Linux 2.0 there is no field giving pathname.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/mem This file can be used to access the
pages of a processs memory through open(2), read(2), and
lseek(2).</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo (since Linux 2.6.26) This file
contains information about mount points. It contains lines
of the form:</p>

<p>36 35 98:0 /mnt1 /mnt2 rw,noatime master:1 - ext3
/dev/root rw,errors=continue (1)(2)(3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)
(9) (10) (11)</p>

<p>The numbers in parentheses are labels for the
descriptions below:</p>

<p>(1) mount ID: unique identifier of the mount (may be
reused after umount(2)).</p>

<p>(2) parent ID: ID of parent mount (or of self for the
top of the mount tree).</p>

<p>(3) major:minor: value of st_dev for files on file
system (see stat(2)).</p>

<p>(4) root: root of the mount within the file system.</p>

<p>(5) mount point: mount point relative to the processs
root.</p>

<p>(6) mount options: per-mount options.</p>

<p>(7) optional fields: zero or more fields of the form
&quot;tag[:value]&quot;.</p>

<p>(8) separator: marks the end of the optional fields.</p>

<p>(9) file system type: name of file system in the form
&quot;type[.subtype]&quot;.</p>

<p>(10) mount source: file system-specific information or
&quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p>(11) super options: per-super block options.</p>

<p>Parsers should ignore all unrecognized optional fields.
Cur- rently the possible optional fields are:</p>

<p>shared:X mount is shared in peer group X</p>

<p>master:X mount is slave to peer group X</p>

<p>propagate_from:X mount is slave and receives propagation
from peer group X (*)</p>

<p>unbindable mount is unbindable</p>

<p>(*) X is the closest dominant peer group under the
processs root. If X is the immediate master of the mount, or
if there is no dominant peer group under the same root, then
only the &quot;mas- ter:X&quot; field is present and not the
&quot;propagate_from:X&quot; field.</p>

<p>For more information on mount propagation see:
Documenta- tion/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt in the kernel
source tree.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/mounts (since Linux 2.4.19) This is a list
of all the file systems currently mounted in the process s
mount namespace. The format of this file is docu- mented in
fstab(5). Since kernel version 2.6.15, this file is
pollable: after opening the file for reading, a change in
this file (i.e., a file system mount or unmount) causes
select(2) to mark the file descriptor as readable, and
poll(2) and epoll_wait(2) mark the file as having an error
condition.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/mountstats (since Linux 2.6.17) This file
exports information (statistics, configuration infor-
mation) about the mount points in the process s name space.
Lines in this file have the form:</p>

<p>device /dev/sda7 mounted on /home with fstype ext3
[statistics] ( 1 ) ( 2 ) (3 ) (4)</p>

<p>The fields in each line are:</p>

<p>(1) The name of the mounted device (or
&quot;nodevice&quot; if there is no corresponding
device).</p>

<p>(2) The mount point within the file system tree.</p>

<p>(3) The file system type.</p>

<p>(4) Optional statistics and configuration information.
Cur- rently (as at Linux 2.6.26), only NFS file systems
export information via this field.</p>

<p>This file is only readable by the owner of the
process.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/numa_maps (since Linux 2.6.14) See
numa(7).</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj (since Linux 2.6.11) This file can
be used to adjust the score used to select which process
should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM) situation. The
kernel uses this value for a bit-shift operation of the pro-
cesss oom_score value: valid values are in the range -16 to
+15, plus the special value -17, which disables OOM-killing
altogether for this process. A positive score increases the
likelihood of this process being killed by the OOM-killer; a
negative score decreases the likelihood.</p>

<p>The default value for this file is 0; a new process
inherits its parent s oom_adj setting. A process must be
privileged (CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) to update this file.</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.36, use of this file is deprecated in
favor of /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/oom_score (since Linux 2.6.11) This file
displays the current score that the kernel gives to this
process for the purpose of selecting a process for the OOM-
killer. A higher score means that the process is more likely
to be selected by the OOM-killer. The basis for this score
is the amount of memory used by the process, with increases
(+) or decreases (-) for factors including:</p>

<p>* whether the process creates a lot of children using
fork(2) (+);</p>

<p>* whether the process has been running a long time, or
has used a lot of CPU time (-);</p>

<p>* whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., &gt;
0) (+);</p>

<p>* whether the process is privileged (-); and</p>

<p>* whether the process is making direct hardware access
(-).</p>

<p>The oom_score also reflects the adjustment specified by
the oom_score_adj or oom_adj setting for the process.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj This file can be used to
adjust the badness heuristic used to select which process
gets killed in out-of-memory conditions.</p>

<p>The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate
task ranging from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to
determine which process is targeted. The units are roughly a
proportion along that range of allowed memory the process
may allocate from, based on an estimation of its current
memory and swap use. For example, if a task is using all
allowed memory, its badness score will be 1000. If it is
using half of its allowed memory, its score will be 500.</p>

<p>There is an additional factor included in the badness
score: root processes are given 3% extra memory over other
tasks.</p>

<p>The amount of &quot;allowed&quot; memory depends on the
context in which the OOM-killer was called. If it is due to
the memory assigned to the allocating tasks cpuset being
exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mems
assigned to that cpuset (see cpuset(7)). If it is due to a
mempolicy s node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory
represents the set of mempolicy nodes. If it is due to a
memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed
memory is that configured limit. Finally, if it is due to
the entire system being out of memory, the allowed memory
represents all allocatable resources.</p>

<p>The value of oom_score_adj is added to the badness score
before it is used to determine which task to kill.
Acceptable values range from -1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to
+1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX). This allows user space to control
the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from always
preferring a certain task or completely disabling it from
OOM-killing. The lowest possible value, -1000, is equivalent
to disabling OOM- killing entirely for that task, since it
will always report a badness score of 0.</p>

<p>Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define
the amount of memory to consider for each task. Setting a
oom_score_adj value of +500, for example, is roughly
equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the
same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller
resources to use at least 50% more memory. A value of -500,
on the other hand, would be roughly equivalent to
discounting 50% of the tasks allowed memory from being
considered as scoring against the task.</p>

<p>For backward compatibility with previous kernels,
/proc/[pid]/oom_adj can still be used to tune the badness
score. Its value is scaled linearly with oom_score_adj.</p>

<p>Writing to /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj or
/proc/[pid]/oom_adj will change the other with its scaled
value.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/root Unix and Linux support the idea of a
per-process root of the file system, set by the chroot(2)
system call. This file is a symbolic link that points to the
processs root directory, and behaves as exe, fd/*, etc.
do.</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of this
symbolic link are not available if the main thread has
already terminated (typically by calling
pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/smaps (since Linux 2.6.14) This file shows
memory consumption for each of the processs mappings. For
each of mappings there is a series of lines such as the
following:</p>

<p>08048000-080bc000 r-xp 00000000 03:02 13130 /bin/bash
Size: 464 kB Rss: 424 kB Shared_Clean: 424 kB Shared_Dirty:
0 kB Private_Clean: 0 kB Private_Dirty: 0 kB</p>

<p>The first of these lines shows the same information as
is dis- played for the mapping in /proc/[pid]/maps. The
remaining lines show the size of the mapping, the amount of
the mapping that is currently resident in RAM, the number of
clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping, and the number
of clean and dirty private pages in the mapping.</p>

<p>This file is only present if the CONFIG_MMU kernel
configuration option is enabled.</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/stat Status information about the process.
This is used by ps(1). It is defined in
/usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c.</p>

<p>The fields, in order, with their proper scanf(3) format
speci- fiers, are:</p>

<p>pid %d The process ID.</p>

<p>comm %s The filename of the executable, in parentheses.
This is visible whether or not the executable is swapped
out.</p>

<p>state %c One character from the string
&quot;RSDZTW&quot; where R is running, S is sleeping in an
interruptible wait, D is waiting in uninterruptible disk
sleep, Z is zom- bie, T is traced or stopped (on a signal),
and W is paging.</p>

<p>ppid %d The PID of the parent.</p>

<p>pgrp %d The process group ID of the process.</p>

<p>session %d The session ID of the process.</p>

<p>tty_nr %d The controlling terminal of the process. (The
minor device number is contained in the combination of bits
31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is in bits 15
t0 8.)</p>

<p>tpgid %d The ID of the foreground process group of the
con- trolling terminal of the process.</p>

<p>flags %u (%lu before Linux 2.6.22) The kernel flags word
of the process. For bit mean- ings, see the PF_* defines in
&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;. Details depend on the kernel
version.</p>

<p>minflt %lu The number of minor faults the process has
made which have not required loading a memory page from
disk.</p>

<p>cminflt %lu The number of minor faults that the processs
waited-for children have made.</p>

<p>majflt %lu The number of major faults the process has
made which have required loading a memory page from
disk.</p>

<p>cmajflt %lu The number of major faults that the processs
waited-for children have made.</p>

<p>utime %lu Amount of time that this process has been
scheduled in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK). This includes guest time, guest_time
(time spent running a virtual CPU, see below), so that
applications that are not aware of the guest time field do
not lose that time from their calculations.</p>

<p>stime %lu Amount of time that this process has been
scheduled in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).</p>

<p>cutime %ld Amount of time that this processs waited-for
chil- dren have been scheduled in user mode, measured in
clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK). (See also
times(2).) This includes guest time, cguest_time (time spent
running a virtual CPU, see below).</p>

<p>cstime %ld Amount of time that this process s waited-for
chil- dren have been scheduled in kernel mode, measured in
clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).</p>

<p>priority %ld (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes
running a real-time scheduling policy (policy below; see
sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated schedul- ing
priority, minus one; that is, a number in the range -2 to
-100, corresponding to real-time priori- ties 1 to 99. For
processes running under a non- real-time scheduling policy,
this is the raw nice value (setpriority(2)) as represented
in the kernel. The kernel stores nice values as numbers in
the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the
user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.</p>

<p>Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on the
scheduler weighting given to this process.</p>

<p>nice %ld The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in
the range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).</p>

<p>num_threads %ld Number of threads in this process (since
Linux 2.6). Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to
0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.</p>

<p>itrealvalue %ld The time in jiffies before the next
SIGALRM is sent to the process due to an interval timer.
Since ker- nel 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained,
and is hard coded as 0.</p>

<p>starttime %llu (was %lu before Linux 2.6) The time in
jiffies the process started after system boot.</p>

<p>vsize %lu Virtual memory size in bytes.</p>

<p>rss %ld Resident Set Size: number of pages the process
has in real memory. This is just the pages which count
towards text, data, or stack space. This does not include
pages which have not been demand-loaded in, or which are
swapped out.</p>

<p>rsslim %lu Current soft limit in bytes on the rss of the
pro- cess; see the description of RLIMIT_RSS in getprior-
ity(2).</p>

<p>startcode %lu The address above which program text can
run.</p>

<p>endcode %lu The address below which program text can
run.</p>

<p>startstack %lu The address of the start (i.e., bottom)
of the stack.</p>

<p>kstkesp %lu The current value of ESP (stack pointer), as
found in the kernel stack page for the process.</p>

<p>kstkeip %lu The current EIP (instruction pointer).</p>

<p>signal %lu The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a
deci- mal number. Obsolete, because it does not provide
information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status
instead.</p>

<p>blocked %lu The bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as
a deci- mal number. Obsolete, because it does not provide
information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status
instead.</p>

<p>sigignore %lu The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed
as a deci- mal number. Obsolete, because it does not provide
information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status
instead.</p>

<p>sigcatch %lu The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as
a decimal number. Obsolete, because it does not provide
information on real-time signals; use /proc/[pid]/status
instead.</p>

<p>wchan %lu This is the &quot;channel&quot; in which the
process is wait- ing. It is the address of a system call,
and can be looked up in a namelist if you need a textual
name. (If you have an up-to-date /etc/psdatabase, then try
ps -l to see the WCHAN field in action.)</p>

<p>nswap %lu Number of pages swapped (not maintained).</p>

<p>cnswap %lu Cumulative nswap for child processes (not
main- tained).</p>

<p>exit_signal %d (since Linux 2.1.22) Signal to be sent to
parent when we die.</p>

<p>processor %d (since Linux 2.2.8) CPU number last
executed on.</p>

<p>rt_priority %u (since Linux 2.5.19; was %lu before Linux
2.6.22) Real-time scheduling priority, a number in the range
1 to 99 for processes scheduled under a real-time policy, or
0, for non-real-time processes (see
sched_setscheduler(2)).</p>

<p>policy %u (since Linux 2.5.19; was %lu before Linux
2.6.22) Scheduling policy (see sched_setscheduler(2)).
Decode using the SCHED_* constants in linux/sched.h.</p>

<p>delayacct_blkio_ticks %llu (since Linux 2.6.18)
Aggregated block I/O delays, measured in clock ticks
(centiseconds).</p>

<p>guest_time %lu (since Linux 2.6.24) Guest time of the
process (time spent running a vir- tual CPU for a guest
operating system), measured in clock ticks (divide by
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).</p>

<p>cguest_time %ld (since Linux 2.6.24) Guest time of the
processs children, measured in clock ticks (divide by
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/statm Provides information about memory
usage, measured in pages. The columns are:</p>

<p>size total program size (same as VmSize in
/proc/[pid]/status) resident resident set size (same as
VmRSS in /proc/[pid]/status) share shared pages (from shared
mappings) text text (code) lib library (unused in Linux 2.6)
data data + stack dt dirty pages (unused in Linux 2.6)</p>

<p>/proc/[pid]/status Provides much of the information in
/proc/[pid]/stat and /proc/[pid]/statm in a format that s
easier for humans to parse. Heres an example:</p>

<p>$ cat /proc/$$/status Name: bash State: S (sleeping)

and for process as a whole (see pthreads(7) and
signal(7)).</p>

<p>* SigBlk, SigIgn, SigCgt: Masks indicating signals being
blocked, ignored, and caught (see signal(7)).</p>

<p>* CapInh, CapPrm, CapEff: Masks of capabilities enabled

<p>/proc/[pid]/task (since Linux 2.6.0-test6) This is a
directory that contains one subdirectory for each thread in
the process. The name of each subdirectory is the numerical
thread ID ([tid]) of the thread (see gettid(2)). Within each
of these subdirectories, there is a set of files with the
same names and contents as under the /proc/[pid] direc-
tories. For attributes that are shared by all threads, the
con- tents for each of the files under the task/[tid]
subdirectories will be the same as in the corresponding file
in the parent /proc/[pid] directory (e.g., in a
multithreaded process, all of the task/[tid]/cwd files will
have the same value as the /proc/[pid]/cwd file in the
parent directory, since all of the threads in a process
share a working directory). For attributes that are distinct
for each thread, the corresponding files under task/[tid]
may have different values (e.g., various fields in each of
the task/[tid]/status files may be different for each
thread).</p>

<p>In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
/proc/[pid]/task directory are not available if the main
thread has already ter- minated (typically by calling
pthread_exit(3)).</p>

<p>/proc/apm Advanced power management version and battery
information when CONFIG_APM is defined at kernel compilation
time.</p>

<p>/proc/bus Contains subdirectories for installed
busses.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pccard Subdirectory for PCMCIA devices when
CONFIG_PCMCIA is set at kernel compilation time.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pccard/drivers</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pci Contains various bus subdirectories and
pseudo-files containing information about PCI busses,
installed devices, and device drivers. Some of these files
are not ASCII.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pci/devices Information about PCI devices.
They may be accessed through lspci(8) and setpci(8).</p>

<p>/proc/cmdline Arguments passed to the Linux kernel at
boot time. Often done via a boot manager such as lilo(8) or
grub(8).</p>

<p>/proc/config.gz (since Linux 2.6) This file exposes the
configuration options that were used to build the currently
running kernel, in the same format as they would be shown in
the .config file that resulted when configur- ing the kernel
(using make xconfig, make config, or similar). The file
contents are compressed; view or search them using zcat(1),
zgrep(1), etc. As long as no changes have been made to the
following file, the contents of /proc/config.gz are the same
as those provided by :</p>

<p>cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/.config</p>

<p>/proc/config.gz is only provided if the kernel is
configured with CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC.</p>

<p>/proc/cpuinfo This is a collection of CPU and system
architecture dependent items, for each supported
architecture a different list. Two common entries are
processor which gives CPU number and bogomips; a system
constant that is calculated during kernel initialization.
SMP machines have information for each CPU.</p>

<p>/proc/devices Text listing of major numbers and device
groups. This can be used by MAKEDEV scripts for consistency
with the kernel.</p>

<p>/proc/diskstats (since Linux 2.5.69) This file contains
disk I/O statistics for each disk device. See the kernel
source file Documentation/iostats.txt for further
information.</p>

<p>/proc/dma This is a list of the registered ISA DMA
(direct memory access) channels in use.</p>

<p>/proc/driver Empty subdirectory.</p>

<p>/proc/execdomains List of the execution domains (ABI
personalities).</p>

<p>/proc/fb Frame buffer information when CONFIG_FB is
defined during kernel compilation.</p>

<p>/proc/filesystems A text listing of the file systems
which are supported by the kernel, namely file systems which
were compiled into the kernel or whose kernel modules are
currently loaded. (See also filesystems(5).) If a file
system is marked with &quot;nodev&quot;, this means that it
does not require a block device to be mounted (e.g., virtual
file system, network file system).</p>

<p>Incidentally, this file may be used by mount(8) when no
file system is specified and it didn t manage to determine
the file system type. Then file systems contained in this
file are tried (excepted those that are marked with
&quot;nodev&quot;).</p>

<p>/proc/fs Contains subdirectories that in turn contain
files with informa- tion about (certain) mounted
filesystems.</p>

<p>/proc/ide This directory exists on systems with the IDE
bus. There are directories for each IDE channel and attached
device. Files include:</p>

<p>cache buffer size in KB capacity number of sectors
driver driver version geometry physical and logical geometry
identify in hexadecimal media media type model manufacturers
model number settings drive settings smart_thresholds in
hexadecimal smart_values in hexadecimal</p>

<p>The hdparm(8) utility provides access to this
information in a friendly format.</p>

<p>/proc/interrupts This is used to record the number of
interrupts per CPU per IO device. Since Linux 2.6.24, for
the i386 and x86_64 architec- tures, at least, this also
includes interrupts internal to the system (that is, not
associated with a device as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable
interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt), and for SMP
systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and
possibly others. Very easy to read formatting, done in
ASCII.</p>

<p>/proc/iomem I/O memory map in Linux 2.4.</p>

<p>/proc/ioports This is a list of currently registered
Input-Output port regions that are in use.</p>

<p>/proc/kallsyms (since Linux 2.5.71) This holds the
kernel exported symbol definitions used by the modules(X)
tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules. In
Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly dif-
ferent syntax was named ksyms.</p>

<p>/proc/kcore This file represents the physical memory of
the system and is stored in the ELF core file format. With
this pseudo-file, and an unstripped kernel
(/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine
the current state of any kernel data structures.</p>

<p>The total length of the file is the size of physical
memory (RAM) plus 4KB.</p>

<p>/proc/kmsg This file can be used instead of the
syslog(2) system call to read kernel messages. A process
must have superuser privileges to read this file, and only
one process should read this file. This file should not be
read if a syslog process is running which uses the syslog(2)
system call facility to log kernel mes- sages.</p>

<p>Information in this file is retrieved with the dmesg(8)
program.</p>

<p>/proc/ksyms (Linux 1.1.23-2.5.47) See
/proc/kallsyms.</p>

<p>/proc/loadavg The first three fields in this file are
load average figures giving the number of jobs in the run
queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged
over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. They are the same as the load
average numbers given by uptime(1) and other programs. The
fourth field consists of two numbers sepa- rated by a slash
(/). The first of these is the number of cur- rently
executing kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads);
this will be less than or equal to the number of CPUs. The
value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling
entities that currently exist on the system. The fifth field
is the PID of the process that was most recently created on
the system.</p>

<p>/proc/locks This file shows current file locks (flock(2)
and fcntl(2)) and leases (fcntl(2)).</p>

<p>/proc/malloc (only up to and including Linux 2.2) This
file is only present if CONFIG_DEBUG_MALLOC was defined
during compilation.</p>

<p>/proc/meminfo This file reports statistics about memory
usage on the system. It is used by free(1) to report the
amount of free and used mem- ory (both physical and swap) on
the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by
the kernel.</p>

<p>/proc/modules A text list of the modules that have been
loaded by the system. See also lsmod(8).</p>

<p>/proc/mounts Before kernel 2.4.19, this file was a list
of all the file sys- tems currently mounted on the system.
With the introduction of per-process mount namespaces in
Linux 2.4.19, this file became a link to /proc/self/mounts,
which lists the mount points of the process s own mount
namespace. The format of this file is docu- mented in
fstab(5).</p>

<p>/proc/mtrr Memory Type Range Registers. See the kernel
source file Docu- mentation/mtrr.txt for details.</p>

<p>/proc/net various net pseudo-files, all of which give
the status of some part of the networking layer. These files
contain ASCII struc- tures and are, therefore, readable with
cat(1). However, the standard netstat(8) suite provides much
cleaner access to these files.</p>

<p>/proc/net/arp This holds an ASCII readable dump of the
kernel ARP table used for address resolutions. It will show
both dynamically learned and pre-programmed ARP entries. The
format is:</p>

<p>IP address HW type Flags HW address Mask Device
192.168.0.50 0x1 0x2 00:50:BF:25:68:F3 * eth0 192.168.0.250
0x1 0xc 00:00:00:00:00:00 * eth0</p>

<p>Here &quot;IP address&quot; is the IPv4 address of the
machine and the &quot;HW type&quot; is the hardware type of
the address from RFC 826. The flags are the internal flags
of the ARP structure (as defined in
/usr/include/linux/if_arp.h) and the &quot;HW address&quot;
is the data link layer mapping for that IP address if it is
known.</p>

<p>/proc/net/dev The dev pseudo-file contains network
device status information. This gives the number of received
and sent packets, the number of errors and collisions and
other basic statistics. These are used by the ifconfig(8)
program to report device status. The format is:</p>

<p>Inter-| Receive | Transmit face |bytes packets errs drop
fifo frame compressed multicast|bytes packets errs drop fifo
colls carrier compressed lo: 2776770 11307 0 0 0 0 0 0

<p>/proc/net/igmp Internet Group Management Protocol.
Defined in /usr/src/linux/net/core/igmp.c.</p>

<p>/proc/net/rarp This file uses the same format as the arp
file and contains the current reverse mapping database used
to provide rarp(8) reverse address lookup services. If RARP
is not configured into the kernel, this file will not be
present.</p>

<p>/proc/net/raw Holds a dump of the RAW socket table. Much
of the information is not of use apart from debugging. The
&quot;sl&quot; value is the ker- nel hash slot for the
socket, the &quot;local_address&quot; is the local address
and protocol number pair. &quot;St&quot; is the internal
status of the socket. The &quot;tx_queue&quot; and
&quot;rx_queue&quot; are the outgoing and incoming data
queue in terms of kernel memory usage. The &quot;tr&quot;,
&quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and &quot;rexmits&quot; fields are
not used by RAW. The &quot;uid&quot; field holds the
effective UID of the creator of the socket.</p>

<p>/proc/net/snmp This file holds the ASCII data needed for
the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP management information bases for
an SNMP agent.</p>

<p>/proc/net/tcp Holds a dump of the TCP socket table. Much
of the information is not of use apart from debugging. The
&quot;sl&quot; value is the ker- nel hash slot for the
socket, the &quot;local_address&quot; is the local address
and port number pair. The &quot;rem_address&quot; is the
remote address and port number pair (if connected).
&quot;St&quot; is the inter- nal status of the socket. The
&quot;tx_queue&quot; and &quot;rx_queue&quot; are the
outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory
usage. The &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and
&quot;rexmits&quot; fields hold internal information of the
kernel socket state and are only useful for debugging. The
&quot;uid&quot; field holds the effective UID of the cre-
ator of the socket.</p>

<p>/proc/net/udp Holds a dump of the UDP socket table. Much
of the information is not of use apart from debugging. The
&quot;sl&quot; value is the ker- nel hash slot for the
socket, the &quot;local_address&quot; is the local address
and port number pair. The &quot;rem_address&quot; is the
remote address and port number pair (if connected).
&quot;St&quot; is the inter- nal status of the socket. The
&quot;tx_queue&quot; and &quot;rx_queue&quot; are the
outgoing and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory
usage. The &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;tm-&gt;when&quot;, and
&quot;rexmits&quot; fields are not used by UDP. The
&quot;uid&quot; field holds the effective UID of the creator
of the socket. The format is:</p>

<p>sl local_address rem_address st tx_queue rx_queue tr
rexmits tm-&gt;when uid 1: 01642C89:0201 0C642C89:03FF 01
00000000:00000001 01:000071BA 00000000 0 1: 00000000:0801
00000000:0000 0A 00000000:00000000 00:00000000 6F000100 0 1:
00000000:0201 00000000:0000 0A 00000000:00000000 00:00000000
00000000 0</p>

<p>/proc/net/unix Lists the Unix domain sockets present
within the system and their status. The format is: Num
RefCount Protocol Flags Type St Path 0: 00000002 00000000
00000000 0001 03 1: 00000001 00000000 00010000 0001 01
/dev/printer</p>

<p>Here &quot;Num&quot; is the kernel table slot number,
&quot;RefCount&quot; is the number of users of the socket,
&quot;Protocol&quot; is currently always 0,
&quot;Flags&quot; represent the internal kernel flags
holding the status of the socket. Currently, type is always
&quot;1&quot; (Unix domain data- gram sockets are not yet
supported in the kernel). &quot;St&quot; is the internal
state of the socket and Path is the bound path (if any) of
the socket.</p>

<p>/proc/partitions Contains major and minor numbers of
each partition as well as number of blocks and partition
name.</p>

<p>/proc/pci This is a listing of all PCI devices found
during kernel ini- tialization and their configuration.</p>

<p>This file has been deprecated in favor of a new /proc
interface for PCI (/proc/bus/pci). It became optional in
Linux 2.2 (available with CONFIG_PCI_OLD_PROC set at kernel
compilation). It became once more non-optionally enabled in
Linux 2.4. Next, it was deprecated in Linux 2.6 (still
available with CON- FIG_PCI_LEGACY_PROC set), and finally
removed altogether since Linux 2.6.17.</p>

<p>/proc/scsi A directory with the scsi mid-level
pseudo-file and various SCSI low-level driver directories,
which contain a file for each SCSI host in this system, all
of which give the status of some part of the SCSI IO
subsystem. These files contain ASCII structures and are,
therefore, readable with cat(1).</p>

<p>You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure
the sub- system or switch certain features on or off.</p>

<p>/proc/scsi/scsi This is a listing of all SCSI devices
known to the kernel. The listing is similar to the one seen
during bootup. scsi cur- rently supports only the
add-single-device command which allows root to add a
hotplugged device to the list of known devices.</p>

<p>The command</p>

<p>echo &rsquo;scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0&rsquo; &gt;
/proc/scsi/scsi</p>

<p>will cause host scsi1 to scan on SCSI channel 0 for a
device on ID 5 LUN 0. If there is already a device known on
this address or the address is invalid, an error will be
returned.</p>

<p>/proc/scsi/[drivername] [drivername] can currently be
NCR53c7xx, aha152x, aha1542, aha1740, aic7xxx, buslogic,
eata_dma, eata_pio, fdomain, in2000, pas16, qlogic,
scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f, ultrastore, or wd7000.
These directories show up for all drivers that reg- istered
at least one SCSI HBA. Every directory contains one file per
registered host. Every host-file is named after the number
the host was assigned during initialization.</p>

<p>Reading these files will usually show driver and host
configura- tion, statistics, etc.</p>

<p>Writing to these files allows different things on
different hosts. For example, with the latency and nolatency
commands, root can switch on and off command latency
measurement code in the eata_dma driver. With the lockup and
unlock commands, root can control bus lockups simulated by
the scsi_debug driver.</p>

<p>/proc/self This directory refers to the process
accessing the /proc file system, and is identical to the
/proc directory named by the process ID of the same
process.</p>

<p>/proc/slabinfo Information about kernel caches. Since
Linux 2.6.16 this file is only present if the CONFIG_SLAB
kernel configuration option is enabled. The columns in
/proc/slabinfo are:</p>

<p>cache-name num-active-objs total-objs object-size
num-active-slabs total-slabs num-pages-per-slab</p>

<p>See slabinfo(5) for details.</p>

<p>/proc/stat kernel/system statistics. Varies with
architecture. Common entries include:</p>

<p>cpu 3357 0 4313 1362393 The amount of time, measured in
units of USER_HZ (1/100ths of a second on most
architectures, use sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) to obtain the right
value), that the system spent in user mode, user mode with
low priority (nice), system mode, and the idle task,
respectively. The last value should be USER_HZ times the
second entry in the uptime pseudo-file.</p>

<p>In Linux 2.6 this line includes three additional
columns: iowait - time waiting for I/O to complete (since
2.5.41); irq - time servicing interrupts (since
2.6.0-test4); softirq - time servicing softirqs (since
2.6.0-test4).</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.11, there is an eighth column, steal -
stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating
systems when running in a virtualized environment</p>

<p>Since Linux 2.6.24, there is a ninth column, guest,
which is the time spent running a virtual CPU for guest
operat- ing systems under the control of the Linux
kernel.</p>

<p>page 5741 1808 The number of pages the system paged in
and the number that were paged out (from disk).</p>

<p>swap 1 0 The number of swap pages that have been brought
in and out.</p>

<p>intr 1462898 This line shows counts of interrupts
serviced since boot time, for each of the possible system
interrupts. The first column is the total of all interrupts
serviced; each subsequent column is the total for a
particular interrupt.</p>

<p>disk_io: (2,0):(31,30,5764,1,2) (3,0):...
(major,disk_idx):(noinfo, read_io_ops, blks_read,
write_io_ops, blks_written) (Linux 2.4 only)</p>

<p>ctxt 115315 The number of context switches that the
system underwent.</p>

<p>btime 769041601 boot time, in seconds since the Epoch
(January 1, 1970).</p>

<p>processes 86031 Number of forks since boot.</p>

<p>procs_running 6 Number of processes in runnable state.
(Linux 2.5.45 onwards.)</p>

<p>procs_blocked 2 Number of processes blocked waiting for
I/O to complete. (Linux 2.5.45 onwards.)</p>

<p>/proc/swaps Swap areas in use. See also swapon(8).</p>

<p>/proc/sys This directory (present since 1.3.57) contains
a number of files and subdirectories corresponding to kernel
variables. These variables can be read and sometimes
modified using the /proc file system, and the (deprecated)
sysctl(2) system call. Presently, there are subdirectories
abi, debug, dev, fs, kernel, net, proc, rxrpc, sunrpc and vm
that each contain more files and subdirectories.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/abi (since Linux 2.4.10) This directory may
contain files with application binary infor- mation. See the
kernel source file Documentation/sysctl/abi.txt for more
information.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/debug This directory may be empty.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/dev This directory contains device-specific
information (e.g., dev/cdrom/info). On some systems, it may
be empty.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs This contains the subdirectories
binfmt_misc, epoll, inotify, and mqueue, and files
dentry-state, dir-notify-enable, dquot-nr, file-max,
file-nr, inode-max, inode-nr, inode-state, lease-
break-time, leases-enable, overflowgid, overflowuid,
suid_dumpable, super-max, and super-nr.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc Documentation for files in this
directory can be found in the kernel sources in
Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dentry-state (since Linux 2.2) This file
contains information about the status of the directory cache
(dcache). The file contains six numbers, nr_dentry,
nr_unused, age_limit (age in seconds), want_pages (pages
requested by system) and two dummy values.</p>

<p>* nr_dentry is the number of allocated dentries (dcache
entries). This field is unused in Linux 2.2.</p>

<p>* nr_unused is the number of unused dentries.</p>

<p>* age_limit is the age in seconds after which dcache
entries can be reclaimed when memory is short.</p>

<p>* want_pages is non-zero when the kernel has called
shrink_dcache_pages() and the dcache isnt pruned yet.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable This file can be used to
disable or enable the dnotify interface described in
fcntl(2) on a system-wide basis. A value of 0 in this file
disables the interface, and a value of 1 enables it.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-max This file shows the maximum
number of cached disk quota entries. On some (2.4) systems,
it is not present. If the number of free cached disk quota
entries is very low and you have some awesome number of
simultaneous system users, you might want to raise the
limit.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr This file shows the number of
allocated disk quota entries and the number of free disk
quota entries.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/epoll (since Linux 2.6.28) This directory
contains the file max_user_watches, which can be used to
limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the epoll
interface. For further details, see inotify(7).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/file-max This file defines a system-wide
limit on the number of open files for all processes. (See
also setrlimit(2), which can be used by a process to set the
per-process limit, RLIMIT_NOFILE, on the number of files it
may open.) If you get lots of error messages about running
out of file handles, try increasing this value:</p>

<p>echo 100000 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max</p>

<p>The kernel constant NR_OPEN imposes an upper limit on
the value that may be placed in file-max.</p>

<p>If you increase /proc/sys/fs/file-max, be sure to
increase /proc/sys/fs/inode-max to 3-4 times the new value
of /proc/sys/fs/file-max, or you will run out of inodes.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/file-nr Historically, the kernel was able
to allocate file handles dynamically, but not to free them
again. The three values in file-nr denote the number of
allocated file handles, the number of allocated but unused
file handles, and the maximum number of file handles. Linux
2.6 always reports 0 as the number of free file handles --
this is not an error, it just means that the number of
allocated file handles exactly matches the number of used
file handles.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max This file contains the maximum
number of in-memory inodes. On some (2.4) systems, it may
not be present. This value should be 3-4 times larger than
the value in file-max, since stdin, stdout and network
sockets also need an inode to handle them. When you
regularly run out of inodes, you need to increase this
value.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr This file contains the first two
values from inode-state.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inode-state This file contains seven
numbers: nr_inodes, nr_free_inodes, preshrink, and four
dummy values. nr_inodes is the number of inodes the system
has allocated. This can be slightly more than inode-max
because Linux allocates them one page full at a time.
nr_free_inodes represents the number of free inodes.
preshrink is non-zero when the nr_inodes &gt; inode-max and
the system needs to prune the inode list instead of
allocating more.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/inotify (since Linux 2.6.13) This directory
contains files max_queued_events, max_user_instances, and
max_user_watches, that can be used to limit the amount of
kernel memory consumed by the inotify inter- face. For
further details, see inotify(7).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time This file specifies the
grace period that the kernel grants to a process holding a
file lease (fcntl(2)) after it has sent a sig- nal to that
process notifying it that another process is waiting to open
the file. If the lease holder does not remove or down- grade
the lease within this grace period, the kernel forcibly
breaks the lease.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/leases-enable This file can be used to
enable or disable file leases (fcntl(2)) on a system-wide
basis. If this file contains the value 0, leases are
disabled. A non-zero value enables leases.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue (since Linux 2.6.6) This directory
contains files msg_max, msgsize_max, and queues_max,
controlling the resources used by POSIX message queues. See
mq_overview(7) for details.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid and /proc/sys/fs/overflowuid
These files allow you to change the value of the fixed UID
and GID. The default is 65534. Some file systems only
support 16-bit UIDs and GIDs, although in Linux UIDs and
GIDs are 32 bits. When one of these file systems is mounted
with writes enabled, any UID or GID that would exceed 65535
is translated to the overflow value before being written to
disk.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable (since Linux 2.6.13) The
value in this file determines whether core dump files are
produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted
binaries. Three different integer values can be
specified:</p>

<p>0 (default) This provides the traditional (pre-Linux
2.6.13) behavior. A core dump will not be produced for a
process which has changed credentials (by calling
seteuid(2), setgid(2), or similar, or by executing a
set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) or whose binary does
not have read permission enabled.</p>

<p>1 (&quot;debug&quot;) All processes dump core when
possible. The core dump is owned by the file system user ID
of the dumping process and no security is applied. This is
intended for system debug- ging situations only. Ptrace is
unchecked.</p>

<p>2 (&quot;suidsafe&quot;) Any binary which normally would
not be dumped (see &quot;0&quot; above) is dumped readable
by root only. This allows the user to remove the core dump
file but not to read it. For security reasons core dumps in
this mode will not overwrite one another or other files.
This mode is appropriate when adminis- trators are
attempting to debug problems in a normal environ- ment.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/super-max This file controls the maximum
number of superblocks, and thus the maximum number of
mounted file systems the kernel can have. You only need to
increase super-max if you need to mount more file systems
than the current value in super-max allows you to.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/fs/super-nr This file contains the number of
file systems currently mounted.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel This directory contains files
controlling a range of kernel parameters, as described
below.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/acct This file contains three numbers:
highwater, lowwater, and fre- quency. If BSD-style process
accounting is enabled these values control its behavior. If
free space on file system where the log lives goes below
lowwater percent accounting suspends. If free space gets
above highwater percent accounting resumes. frequency
determines how often the kernel checks the amount of free
space (value is in seconds). Default values are 4, 2 and 30.
That is, suspend accounting if 2% or less space is free;
resume it if 4% or more space is free; consider information
about amount of free space valid for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound (from Linux 2.2 to 2.6.24)
This file holds the value of the kernel capability bounding
set (expressed as a signed decimal number). This set is
ANDed against the capabilities permitted to a process during
execve(2). Starting with Linux 2.6.25, the system-wide
capabil- ity bounding set disappeared, and was replaced by a
per-thread bounding set; see capabilities(7).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern See core(5).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid See core(5).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del This file controls the
handling of Ctrl-Alt-Del from the key- board. When the value
in this file is 0, Ctrl-Alt-Del is trapped and sent to the
init(8) program to handle a graceful restart. When the value
is greater than zero, Linuxs reaction to a Vulcan Nerve
Pinch (tm) will be an immediate reboot, with- out even
syncing its dirty buffers. Note: when a program (like
dosemu) has the keyboard in &quot;raw&quot; mode, the
ctrl-alt-del is intercepted by the program before it ever
reaches the kernel tty layer, and its up to the program to
decide what to do with it.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict The value in this file
determines who can see kernel syslog con- tents. A value of
0 in this file imposes no restrictions. If the value is 1,
only privileged users can read the kernel sys- log. (See
syslog(2) for more details.) Since Linux 3.4, only users
with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability may change the value in
this file.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug This file contains the path for
the hotplug policy agent. The default value in this file is
/sbin/hotplug.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/domainname and
/proc/sys/kernel/hostname can be used to set the NIS/YP
domainname and the hostname of your box in exactly the same
way as the commands domainname(1) and hostname(1), that
is:</p>

<p># echo &rsquo;darkstar&rsquo; &gt;
/proc/sys/kernel/hostname # echo &rsquo;mydomain&rsquo; &gt;
/proc/sys/kernel/domainname</p>

<p>has the same effect as</p>

<p># hostname &rsquo;darkstar&rsquo; # domainname
&rsquo;mydomain&rsquo;</p>

<p>Note, however, that the classic darkstar.frop.org has
the host- name &quot;darkstar&quot; and DNS (Internet Domain
Name Server) domainname &quot;frop.org&quot;, not to be
confused with the NIS (Network Information Service) or YP
(Yellow Pages) domainname. These two domain names are in
general different. For a detailed discussion see the
hostname(1) man page.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/htab-reclaim (PowerPC only) If this
file is set to a non-zero value, the Pow- erPC htab (see
kernel file Documentation/powerpc/ppc_htab.txt) is pruned
each time the system hits the idle loop.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict The value in this file
determines whether kernel addresses are exposed via /proc
files and other interfaces. A value of 0 in this file
imposes no restrictions. If the value is 1, kernel pointers
printed using the %pK format specifier will be replaced with
zeros unless the user has the CAP_SYSLOG capability. If the
value is 2, kernel pointers printed using the %pK format
specifier will be replaced with zeros regardless of the
users capabilities. The initial default value for this file
was 1, but the default was changed to 0 in Linux 2.6.39.
Since Linux 3.4, only users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability can change the value in this file.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/l2cr (PowerPC only) This file contains
a flag that controls the L2 cache of G3 processor boards. If
0, the cache is disabled. Enabled if non-zero.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe This file contains the path
for the kernel module loader. The default value is
/sbin/modprobe. The file is only present if the kernel is
built with the CONFIG_KMOD option enabled. It is described
by the kernel source file Documentation/kmod.txt (only
present in kernel 2.4 and earlier).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax This file defines a system-wide
limit specifying the maximum number of bytes in a single
message written on a System V mes- sage queue.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni This file defines the
system-wide limit on the number of message queue
identifiers. (This file is only present in Linux 2.4
onwards.)</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb This file defines a system-wide
parameter used to initialize the msg_qbytes setting for
subsequently created message queues. The msg_qbytes setting
specifies the maximum number of bytes that may be written to
the message queue.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/ostype and /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease
These files give substrings of /proc/version.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid and
/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid These files duplicate the files
/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid and /proc/sys/fs/overflowuid.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/panic This file gives read/write access
to the kernel variable panic_timeout. If this is zero, the
kernel will loop on a panic; if non-zero it indicates that
the kernel should autore- boot after this number of seconds.
When you use the software watchdog device driver, the
recommended setting is 60.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops (since Linux 2.5.68) This
file controls the kernels behavior when an oops or BUG is
encountered. If this file contains 0, then the system tries
to continue operation. If it contains 1, then the system
delays a few seconds (to give klogd time to record the oops
output) and then panics. If the /proc/sys/kernel/panic file
is also non- zero then the machine will be rebooted.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max( since Linux 2.5.34) This file
specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around (i.e., the
value in this file is one greater than the maximum PID). The
default value for this file, 32768, results in the same
range of PIDs as on earlier kernels. On 32-bit platforms,
32768 is the maximum value for pid_max. On 64-bit systems,
pid_max can be set to any value up to 2^22 (PID_MAX_LIMIT,
approximately 4 million).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap (PowerPC only) This file
contains a flag. If set, Linux-PPC will use the
&quot;nap&quot; mode of powersaving, otherwise the
&quot;doze&quot; mode will be used.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/printk The four values in this file are
console_loglevel, default_mes- sage_loglevel,
minimum_console_level, and default_con- sole_loglevel. These
values influence printk() behavior when printing or logging
error messages. See syslog(2) for more info on the different
loglevels. Messages with a higher priority than
console_loglevel will be printed to the console. Messages
without an explicit priority will be printed with priority
default_message_level. minimum_console_loglevel is the
minimum (highest) value to which console_loglevel can be
set. default_console_loglevel is the default value for con-
sole_loglevel.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pty (since Linux 2.6.4) This directory
contains two files relating to the number of Unix 98
pseudo-terminals (see pts(4)) on the system.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max This file defines the maximum
number of pseudo-terminals.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr This read-only file indicates
how many pseudo-terminals are cur- rently in use.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/random This directory contains various
parameters controlling the oper- ation of the file
/dev/random. See random(4) for further infor- mation.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev This file is documented
in the kernel source file Documenta- tion/initrd.txt.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd (Sparc only) This file seems
to be a way to give an argument to the SPARC ROM/Flash boot
loader. Maybe to tell it what to do after rebooting?</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max (Only in kernels up to and
including 2.6.7; see setrlimit(2)) This file can be used to
tune the maximum number of POSIX real- time (queued) signals
that can be outstanding in the system.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr (Only in kernels up to and
including 2.6.7.) This file shows the number POSIX real-time
signals currently queued.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/sem (since Linux 2.4) This file
contains 4 numbers defining limits for System V IPC
semaphores. These fields are, in order:</p>

<p>SEMMSL The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.</p>

<p>SEMMNS A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores
in all semaphore sets.</p>

<p>SEMOPM The maximum number of operations that may be
specified in a semop(2) call.</p>

<p>SEMMNI A system-wide limit on the maximum number of
semaphore identifiers.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff This file shows the size of
the generic SCSI device (sg) buffer. You cant tune it just
yet, but you could change it at compile time by editing
include/scsi/sg.h and changing the value of SG_BIG_BUFF.
However, there shouldn t be any reason to change this
value.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/shmall This file contains the
system-wide limit on the total number of pages of System V
shared memory.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax This file can be used to query
and set the run-time limit on the maximum (System V IPC)
shared memory segment size that can be created. Shared
memory segments up to 1GB are now supported in the kernel.
This value defaults to SHMMAX.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni (available in Linux 2.4 and
onwards) This file specifies the system-wide maximum number
of System V shared memory segments that can be created.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq This file controls the functions
allowed to be invoked by the SysRq key. By default, the file
contains 1 meaning that every possible SysRq request is
allowed (in older kernel versions, SysRq was disabled by
default, and you were required to specifi- cally enable it
at run-time, but this is not the case any more). Possible
values in this file are:</p>

<p>0 - disable sysrq completely 1 - enable all functions of
sysrq &gt;1 - bitmask of allowed sysrq functions, as
follows: 2 - enable control of console logging level 4 -
enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw) 8 - enable debugging
dumps of processes etc. 16 - enable sync command 32 - enable
remount read-only 64 - enable signalling of processes (term,
kill, oom- kill) 128 - allow reboot/poweroff 256 - allow
nicing of all real-time tasks</p>

<p>This file is only present if the CONFIG_MAGIG_SYSRQ
kernel con- figuration option is enabled. For further
details see the ker- nel source file
Documentation/sysrq.txt.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/version This file contains a string
like:</p>

<p>#5 Wed Feb 25 21:49:24 MET 1998</p>

<p>The &quot;#5&quot; means that this is the fifth kernel
built from this source base and the date behind it indicates
the time the kernel was built.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max (since Linux 2.3.11) This
file specifies the system-wide limit on the number of
threads (tasks) that can be created on the system.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/kernel/zero-paged (PowerPC only) This file
contains a flag. When enabled (non-zero), Linux-PPC will
pre-zero pages in the idle loop, possibly speeding up
get_free_pages.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/net This directory contains networking stuff.
Explanations for some of the files under this directory can
be found in tcp(7) and ip(7).</p>

<p>/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn This file defines a ceiling
value for the backlog argument of listen(2); see the
listen(2) manual page for details.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/proc This directory may be empty.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/sunrpc This directory supports Sun remote
procedure call for network file system (NFS). On some
systems, it is not present.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm This directory contains files for memory
management tuning, buffer and cache management.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches (since Linux 2.6.16) Writing to
this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries
and inodes from memory, causing that memory to become
free.</p>

<p>To free pagecache, use echo 1 &gt;
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; to free dentries and inodes, use
echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; to free pagecache,
dentries and inodes, use echo 3 &gt;
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.</p>

<p>Because this is a non-destructive operation and dirty
objects are not freeable, the user should run sync(8)
first.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/swappiness The value in this file controls
how aggressively the kernel will swap memory pages. Higher
values increase agressiveness, lower values descrease
aggressiveness. The default value is 60.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout (since Linux 2.6.9) If
non-zero, this disables the new 32-bit memory-mapping
layout; the kernel will use the legacy (2.4) layout for all
processes.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks (since Linux 2.6.25) Enables
a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads) to be
produced when the kernel performs an OOM-killing. The dump
includes the following information for each task (thread,
pro- cess): thread ID, real user ID, thread group ID
(process ID), virtual memory size, resident set size, the
CPU that the task is scheduled on, oom_adj score (see the
description of /proc/[pid]/oom_adj), and command name. This
is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was invoked and
to identify the rogue task that caused it.</p>

<p>If this contains the value zero, this information is
suppressed. On very large systems with thousands of tasks,
it may not be feasible to dump the memory state information
for each one. Such systems should not be forced to incur a
performance penalty in OOM situations when the information
may not be desired.</p>

<p>If this is set to non-zero, this information is shown
whenever the OOM-killer actually kills a memory-hogging
task.</p>

<p>The default value is 0.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task (since Linux
2.6.24) This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering
task in out- of-memory situations.</p>

<p>If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through
the entire tasklist and select a task based on heuristics to
kill. This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging task that
frees up a large amount of memory when killed.</p>

<p>If this is set to non-zero, the OOM-killer simply kills
the task that triggered the out-of-memory condition. This
avoids a pos- sibly expensive tasklist scan.</p>

<p>If /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom is non-zero, it takes
precedence over whatever value is used in
/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocat- ing_task.</p>

<p>The default value is 0.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory This file contains the
kernel virtual memory accounting mode. Values are:</p>

<p>0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default) 1: always
overcommit, never check 2: always check, never
overcommit</p>

<p>In mode 0, calls of mmap(2) with MAP_NORESERVE are not
checked, and the default check is very weak, leading to the
risk of get- ting a process &quot;OOM-killed&quot;. Under
Linux 2.4 any non-zero value implies mode 1. In mode 2
(available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space
on the system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)), where SS is
the size of the swap space, and RAM is the size of the
physical memory, and r is the contents of the file
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio See the description of
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory.</p>

<p>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom (since Linux 2.6.18) This
enables or disables a kernel panic in an out-of-memory sit-
uation.</p>

<p>If this file is set to the value 0, the kernels
OOM-killer will kill some rogue process. Usually, the
OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the system
will survive.</p>

<p>If this file is set to the value 1, then the kernel
normally panics when out-of-memory happens. However, if a
process limits allocations to certain nodes using memory
policies (mbind(2) MPOL_BIND) or cpusets (cpuset(7)) and
those nodes reach memory exhaustion status, one process may
be killed by the OOM-killer. No panic occurs in this case:
because other nodes memory may be free, this means the
system as a whole may not have reached an out-of-memory
situation yet.</p>

<p>If this file is set to the value 2, the kernel always
panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.</p>

<p>The default value is 0. 1 and 2 are for failover of
clustering. Select either according to your policy of
failover.</p>

<p>/proc/sysrq-trigger (since Linux 2.4.21) Writing a
character to this file triggers the same SysRq func- tion as
typing ALT-SysRq-&lt;character&gt; (see the description of
/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq). This file is normally only writable
by root. For further details see the kernel source file
Documenta- tion/sysrq.txt.</p>

<p>/proc/sysvipc Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files
msg, sem and shm. These files list the System V Interprocess
Communication (IPC) objects (respectively: message queues,
semaphores, and shared memory) that currently exist on the
system, providing similar information to that available via
ipcs(1). These files have headers and are formatted (one IPC
object per line) for easy understanding. svipc(7) provides
further background on the information shown by these
files.</p>

<p>/proc/tty Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and
subdirectories for tty drivers and line disciplines.</p>

<p>/proc/uptime This file contains two numbers: the uptime
of the system (sec- onds), and the amount of time spent in
idle process (seconds).</p>

<p>/proc/version This string identifies the kernel version
that is currently run- ning. It includes the contents of
/proc/sys/kernel/ostype, /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease and
/proc/sys/kernel/version. For example: Linux version 1.0.9
(quinlan@phaze) #1 Sat May 14 01:51:54 EDT 1994</p>

<p>/proc/vmstat (since Linux 2.6) This file displays
various virtual memory statistics.</p>

<p>/proc/zoneinfo (since Linux 2.6.13) This file display
information about memory zones. This is use- ful for
analyzing virtual memory behavior.</p>

<p>NOTES Many strings (i.e., the environment and command
line) are in the inter- nal format, with sub-fields
terminated by null bytes (&rsquo; &rsquo;), so you may find
that things are more readable if you use od -c or tr
&quot;000&quot; &quot;n&quot; to read them. Alternatively,
echo &lsquo;cat &lt;file&gt;&lsquo; works well.</p>

<p>This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and
is the kind of thing that needs to be updated very
often.</p>
