<p>NAME Xft - X FreeType interface library</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Xft is a simple library designed to
interface the FreeType rasterizer with the X Rendering
Extension. This manual page barely scratches the surface of
this library.</p>

<p>HEADER FILE #include &lt;X11/Xft/Xft.h&gt;</p>

<p>CONSTANTS XFT_MAJOR is the major version number of
Xft.</p>

<p>XFT_MINOR is the minor version number of Xft.</p>

<p>XFT_REVISION is the revision number of Xft.</p>

<p>XFT_VERSION is XFT_MAJOR times 10000 (ten thousand),
plus XFT_MINOR times 100, plus XFT_REVISION.</p>

<p>XftVersion is an alias for XFT_VERSION.</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how Xft s version
constants might be used: #if (XFT_VERSION &gt;= 20107)
(void) puts(&quot;Version 2.1.7 or later of the Xft library
is in&quot; &quot; use.&quot;); #else (void)
printf(&quot;Insufficient version of Xft (%d.%d.%d)
installed; &quot; need at least version 2.1.7.0, XFT_MAJOR,
XFT_MINOR, XFT_REVISION); #endif</p>

<p>DATA TYPES XftFont typedef struct _XftFont { int ascent;
int descent; int height; int max_advance_width; FcCharSet
*charset; FcPattern *pattern; } XftFont; An XftFont is the
primary data structure of interest to program- mers using
Xft; it contains general font metrics and pointers to the
Fontconfig character set and pattern associated with the
font. The FcCharSet and FcPattern data types are defined by
the Fontconfig library.</p>

<p>XftFonts are populated with any of XftFontOpen(),
XftFontOpen- Name(), XftFontOpenXlfd(), XftFontOpenInfo(),
or XftFontOpenPat- tern(). XftFontCopy() is used to
duplicate XftFonts, and Xft- FontClose() is used to mark an
XftFont as unused. XftFonts are internally allocated,
reference-counted, and freed by Xft; the programmer does not
ordinarily need to allocate or free storage for them.</p>

<p>XftDrawGlyphs(), the XftDrawString*() family,
XftDrawCharSpec(), and XftDrawGlyphSpec() use XftFonts to
render text to an XftDraw object, which may correspond to
either a core X drawable or an X Rendering Extension
drawable.</p>

<p>XftGlyphExtents() and the XftTextExtents*() family are
used to determine the extents (maximum dimensions) of an
XftFont.</p>

<p>An XftFonts glyph or character coverage can be
determined with XftFontCheckGlyph() or XftCharExists().
XftCharIndex() returns the XftFont-specific character index
corresponding to a given Unicode codepoint.</p>

<p>XftGlyphRender(), XftGlyphSpecRender(),
XftCharSpecRender(), and the XftTextRender*() family use
XftFonts to draw into X Render- ing Extension Picture
structures. Note: XftDrawGlyphs(), the XftDrawString*()
family, XftDrawCharSpec(), and XftDrawGlyph- Spec() provide
a means of rendering fonts that is independent of the
availability of the X Rendering Extension on the X
server.</p>

<p>XftFontInfo is an opaque object that stores information
about a font. Xft- FontInfo structures are created with
XftFontInfoCreate(), freed with XftFontInfoDestroy(), and
compared with XftFontInfoEqual(). XftFontInfo objects are
internally allocated and freed by Xft; the programmer does
not ordinarily need to allocate or free storage for
them.</p>

<p>Each XftFontInfo structure in use is associated with a
unique identifier, which can be retrieved with
XftFontInfoHash(). An XftFont can be opened based on
XftFontInfo data with Xft- FontOpenInfo().</p>

<p>XftColor typedef struct _XftColor { unsigned long pixel;
XRenderColor color; } XftColor; An XftColor object permits
text and other items to be rendered in a particular color
(or the closest approximation offered by the X visual in
use). The XRenderColor data type is defined by the X Render
Extension library.</p>

<p>XftColorAllocName() and XftColorAllocValue() request a
color allocation from the X server (if necessary) and
initialize the members of XftColor. XftColorFree() instructs
the X server to free the color currently allocated for an
XftColor.</p>

<p>One an XftColor has been initialized,
XftDrawSrcPicture(), Xft- DrawGlyphs(), the XftDrawString*()
family, XftDrawCharSpec(), XftDrawCharFontSpec(),
XftDrawGlyphSpec(), XftDrawGlyph- FontSpec(), and
XftDrawRect() may be used to draw various objects using
it.</p>

<p>XftDraw is an opaque object which holds information used
to render to an X drawable using either the core protocol or
the X Rendering extension.</p>

<p>XftDraw objects are created with any of XftDrawCreate()
(which associates an XftDraw with an existing X drawable),
XftDrawCre- ateBitmap(), or XftDrawCreateAlpha(), and
destroyed with Xft- DrawDestroy(). The X drawable associated
with an XftDraw can be changed with XftDrawChange().
XftDraws are internally allocated and freed by Xft; the
programmer does not ordinarily need to allocate or free
storage for them.</p>

<p>The X Display, Drawable, Colormap, and Visual of an
XftDraw can be queried with XftDrawDisplay(),
XftDrawDrawable(), XftDrawCol- ormap(), and XftDrawVisual(),
respectively. The X Rendering Extension Picture associated
with an XftDraw is returned by Xft- DrawPicture().</p>

<p>XftCharSpec typedef struct _XftCharSpec { FcChar32 ucs4;
short x; short y; } XftCharSpec;</p>

<p>The FcChar32 data type is defined by the Fontconfig
library.</p>

<p>XftCharFontSpec typedef struct _XftCharFontSpec {
XftFont *font; FcChar32 ucs4; short x; short y; }
XftCharFontSpec;</p>

<p>The FcChar32 data type is defined by the Fontconfig
library.</p>

<p>XftGlyphSpec typedef struct _XftGlyphSpec { FT_UInt
glyph; short x; short y; } XftGlyphSpec;</p>

<p>The FT_UInt data type is defined by the FreeType
library.</p>

<p>XftGlyphFontSpec typedef struct _XftGlyphFontSpec {
XftFont *font; FT_UInt glyph; short x; short y; }
XftGlyphFontSpec;</p>

<p>The FT_UInt data type is defined by the FreeType
library.</p>

<p>FUNCTIONS Opening and Matching Fonts XftFont *
XftFontOpen (Display *dpy, int screen, ...); XftFontOpen
takes a list of pattern element triples of the form field,
type, value (terminated with a NULL), matches that pattern
against the available fonts, and opens the matching font,
sizing it correctly for screen number screen on display dpy.
The Display data type is defined by the X11 library. Returns
NULL if no match is found.</p>

<p>Example: font = XftFontOpen (dpy, screen, XFT_FAMILY,
XftTypeString, &quot;charter&quot;, XFT_SIZE, XftTypeDouble,
12.0, NULL); This opens the charter font at 12 points. The
point size is automat- ically converted to the correct pixel
size based on the resolution of the monitor.</p>

<p>XftFont * XftFontOpenName (Display *dpy, int screen,
unsigned char *name); XftFontOpenName behaves as XftFontOpen
does, except that it takes a Fontconfig pattern string
(which is passed to the Fontconfig librarys FcNameParse()
function).</p>

<p>XftFont * XftFontOpenXlfd (Display *dpy, int screen,
unsigned char *xlfd) XftFontOpenXlfd behaves as XftFontOpen
does, except that it takes a string containing an X Logical
Font Description (XLFD).</p>

<p>FcPattern * XftFontMatch (Display *dpy, int screen,
FcPattern *pattern, FcResult *result); Also used internally
by the XftFontOpen* functions, XftFontMatch can also be used
directly to determine the Fontconfig font pattern result-
ing from an Xft font open request. The FcPattern and
FcResult data types are defined by the Fontconfig
library.</p>

<p>Determining the Pixel Extents of a Text String void
XftTextExtents8 (Display *dpy, XftFont *font, FcChar8
*string, int len, XGlyphInfo *extents); XftTextExtents8
computes the pixel extents on display dpy of no more than
len glyphs of a string consisting of eight-bit characters
when drawn with font, storing them in extents. The FcChar8
data type is defined by the Fontconfig library, and the
XGlyphInfo data type is defined by the X Rendering Extension
library.</p>

<p>void XftTextExtents16 (Display *dpy, XftFont *font,
FcChar16 *string, int len, XGlyphInfo *extents);
XftTextExtents16 computes the pixel extents on display dpy
of no more than len glyphs of a string consisting of
sixteen-bit characters when drawn with font, storing them in
extents. The FcChar16 data type is defined by the Fontconfig
library, and the XGlyphInfo data type is defined by the X
Rendering Extension library.</p>

<p>void XftTextExtents32 (Display *dpy, XftFont *font,
FcChar32 *string, int len, XGlyphInfo *extents);
XftTextExtents32 computes the pixel extents on display dpy
of no more than len glyphs of a string consisting of
thirty-two-bit characters when drawn with font, storing them
in extents. The FcChar32 data type is defined by the
Fontconfig library, and the XGlyphInfo data type is defined
by the X Rendering Extension library.</p>

<p>void XftTextExtentsUtf8 (Display *dpy, XftFont *font,
FcChar8 *string, int len, XGlyphInfo *extents);
XftTextExtentsUtf8 computes the pixel extents on display dpy
of no more than len bytes of a UTF-8 encoded string when
drawn with font, storing them in extents. The XGlyphInfo
data type is defined by the X Render- ing Extension
library.</p>

<p>void XftTextExtentsUtf16 (Display *dpy, XftFont *font,
FcChar8 *string, FcEndian endian, int len, XGlyphInfo
*extents); XftTextExtentsUtf16 computes the pixel extents on
display dpy of no more than len bytes of a UTF-16LE- or
UTF-16BE-encoded string when drawn with font, storing them
in extents. The endianness of string must be specified in
endian. The FcEndian data type is defined by the Fontconfig
library, and the XGlyphInfo data type is defined by the X
Rendering Extension library.</p>

<p>void XftGlyphExtents (Display *dpy, XftFont *font,
FT_UInt *glyphs, int nglyphs, XGlyphInfo *extents); Also
used internally by the XftTextExtents* functions,
XftGlyphExtents computes the pixel extents on display dpy of
no more than nglyphs in the array glyphs drawn with font,
storing them in extents. The FT_UInt data type is defined by
the FreeType library, and the XGlyphInfo data type is
defined by the X Rendering Extension library.</p>

<p>Drawing Strings (and Other Things) XftDraw *
XftDrawCreate (Display *dpy, Drawable drawable, Visual
*visual, Colormap colormap); XftDrawCreate creates a
structure that can be used to render text and rectangles
using the specified drawable, visual, and colormap on dis-
play. The Drawable, Visual, and Colormap data types are
defined by the X11 library.</p>

<p>XftDraw * XftDrawCreateBitmap (Display *dpy, Pixmap
bitmap); XftDrawCreateBitmap behaves as XftDrawCreate,
except it uses an X pixmap of color depth 1 instead of an X
drawable. The Pixmap data type is defined by the X11
library.</p>

<p>XftDraw * XftDrawCreateAlpha (Display *dpy, Pixmap
pixmap, int depth); XftDrawCreateAlpha behaves as
XftDrawCreate, except it uses an X pixmap of color depth
depth instead of an X drawable. The Pixmap data type is
defined by the X11 library.</p>

<p>void XftDrawChange (XftDraw *draw, Drawable drawable);
XftDrawChange changes the X drawable association of the
existing Xft draw object draw from its current value to
drawable.</p>

<p>Display * XftDrawDisplay (XftDraw *draw); XftDrawDisplay
returns a pointer to the display associated with the Xft
draw object draw.</p>

<p>Drawable XftDrawDrawable (XftDraw *draw);
XftDrawDrawable returns the X drawable associated with the
Xft draw object draw.</p>

<p>Colormap XftDrawColormap (XftDraw *draw);
XftDrawColormap returns the colormap associatied with the
Xft draw object draw.</p>

<p>Visual * XftDrawVisual (XftDraw *draw); XftDrawVisual
returns a pointer to the visual associated with the Xft draw
object draw.</p>

<p>Picture XftDrawPicture (XftDraw *draw); XftDrawPicture
returns the picture associated with the Xft draw object
draw. If the the X server does not support the X Rendering
Extension, 0 is returned.</p>

<p>Picture XftDrawSrcPicture (XftDraw *draw, XftColor
*color); This function is never called if the X server
doesnt support the X Rendering Extension; instead,
XftGlyphCore is used.</p>

<p>void XftDrawDestroy (XftDraw *draw); XftDrawDestroy
destroys draw (created by one of the XftCreate func- tions)
and frees the memory that was allocated for it.</p>

<p>void XftDrawString8 (XftDraw *d, XRenderColor *color,
XftFont *font, int x, int y, unsigned char *string, int
len); XftDrawString8 draws no more than len glyphs of string
to Xft drawable d using font in color at position x, y. The
XRenderColor data type is defined by the X Rendering
Extension library.</p>

<p>void XftDrawRect (XftDraw *d, XRenderColor *color, int
x, int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height);
XftDrawRect draws a solid rectangle of the specified color,
width, and height at position x, y to Xft drawable d.</p>

<p>COMPATIBILITY As of version 2, Xft has become relatively
stable and is expected to retain source and binary
compatibility in future releases.</p>

<p>Xft does provide a compatibility interface to its
previous major ver- sion, Xft 1.x, described below.</p>

<p>Xft 1.x Compatibility Header File #include
&lt;X11/Xft/XftCompat.h&gt;</p>

<p>Xft 1.x Compatibility Data Types XftPattern holds a set
of names with associated value lists; each name refers to a
property of a font. XftPatterns are used as inputs to the
matching code as well as holding information about spe-
cific fonts.</p>

<p>XftFontSet contains a list of XftPatterns. Internally,
Xft uses this data structure to hold sets of fonts.
Externally, Xft returns the results of listing fonts in this
format.</p>

<p>XftObjectSet holds a set of names and is used to specify
which fields from fonts are placed in the the list of
returned patterns when list- ing fonts.</p>
