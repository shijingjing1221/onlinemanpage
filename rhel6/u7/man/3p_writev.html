<p>WRITEV(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual WRITEV(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME writev - write a vector</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;</p>

<p>ssize_t writev(int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int
iovcnt);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The writev() function shall be equivalent to
write(), except as described below. The writev() function
shall gather output data from the iovcnt buffers specified
by the members of the iov array: iov[0], iov[1], ...,
iov[iovcnt-1]. The iovcnt argument is valid if greater than
0 and less than or equal to {IOV_MAX}, as defined in
&lt;limits.h&gt;.</p>

<p>Each iovec entry specifies the base address and length
of an area in memory from which data should be written. The
writev() function shall always write a complete area before
proceeding to the next.</p>

<p>If fildes refers to a regular file and all of the
iov_len members in the array pointed to by iov are 0,
writev() shall return 0 and have no other effect. For other
file types, the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p>If the sum of the iov_len values is greater than
{SSIZE_MAX}, the oper- ation shall fail and no data shall be
transferred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, writev() shall
return the number of bytes actually written. Otherwise, it
shall return a value of -1, the file- pointer shall remain
unchanged, and errno shall be set to indicate an error.</p>

<p>ERRORS Refer to write().</p>

<p>In addition, the writev() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values in the iov array
would overflow an ssize_t.</p>

<p>The writev() function may fail and set errno to:</p>

<p>EINVAL The iovcnt argument was less than or equal to 0,
or greater than {IOV_MAX}.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Writing Data from an Array The following
example writes data from the buffers specified by members of
the iov array to the file associated with the file
descriptor fd.</p>

<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; ... ssize_t bytes_written; int fd;
char *buf0 = &quot;short strinn&quot;; char *buf1 =
&quot;This is a longer strinn&quot;; char *buf2 = &quot;This
is the longest string in this exampln&quot;; int iovcnt;
struct iovec iov[3];</p>

<p>iov[0].iov_base = buf0; iov[0].iov_len = strlen(buf0);
iov[1].iov_base = buf1; iov[1].iov_len = strlen(buf1);
iov[2].iov_base = buf2; iov[2].iov_len = strlen(buf2); ...
iovcnt = sizeof(iov) / sizeof(struct iovec);</p>

<p>bytes_written = writev(fd, iov, iovcnt); ...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Refer to write().</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
