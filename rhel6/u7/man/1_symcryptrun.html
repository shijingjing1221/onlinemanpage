<p>SYMCRYPTRUN(1) GNU Privacy Guard SYMCRYPTRUN(1)</p>

<p>NAME symcryptrun - Call a simple symmetric encryption
tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS symcryptrun --class class --program program
--keyfile keyfile [--decrypt|--encrypt] [inputfile]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Sometimes simple encryption tools are
already in use for a long time and there might be a desire
to integrate them into the GnuPG framework. The protocols
and encryption methods might be non-standard or not even
properly documented, so that a full-fledged encryption tool
with an interface like gpg is not doable. symcryptrun
provides a solution: It operates by calling the external
encryption/decryption module and pro- vides a passphrase for
a key using the standard pinentry based mecha- nism through
gpg-agent.</p>

<p>Note, that symcryptrun is only available if GnuPG has
been configured with &rsquo;--enable-symcryptrun&rsquo; at
build time.</p>

<p>For encryption, the plain text must be provided on STDIN
or as the argument inputfile, and the ciphertext will be
output to STDOUT. For decryption vice versa.</p>

<p>CLASS describes the calling conventions of the external
tool. Cur- rently it must be given as
&rsquo;confucius&rsquo;. PROGRAM is the full filename of
that external tool.</p>

<p>For the class &rsquo;confucius&rsquo; the option
--keyfile is required; keyfile is the name of a file
containing the secret key, which may be protected by a
passphrase. For detailed calling conventions, see the source
code.</p>

<p>Note, that gpg-agent must be running before starting
symcryptrun.</p>

<p>The following additional options may be used:</p>

<p>-v</p>

<p>--verbose Output additional information while
running.</p>

<p>-q</p>

<p>--quiet Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>--homedir dir Set the name of the home directory to dir.
If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to
~/.gnupg . It is only recognized when given on the command
line. It also overrides any home directory stated through
the environment variable GNUPGHOME or (on W32 systems) by
means of the Registry entry
HKCUSoftwareGNUGnuPG:HomeDir.</p>

<p>--log-file file Append all logging output to file.
Default is to write logging information to STDERR.</p>

<p>The possible exit status codes of symcryptrun are:</p>

<p>0 Success.</p>

<p>1 Some error occured.</p>

<p>2 No valid passphrase was provided.</p>

<p>3 The operation was canceled by the user.</p>

<p>The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a
Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command</p>

<p>info gnupg</p>

<p>should give you access to the complete manual including
a menu struc- ture and an index.</p>
