<p>WCPNCPY(3) Linux Programmer s Manual WCPNCPY(3)</p>

<p>NAME wcpncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide
characters, returning a pointer to its end</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #define _GNU_SOURCE #include
&lt;wchar.h&gt;</p>

<p>wchar_t *wcpncpy(wchar_t *dest, const wchar_t *src,
size_t n);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The wcpncpy() function is the wide-character
equivalent of the stp- ncpy(3) function. It copies at most n
wide characters from the wide- character string pointed to
by src, including the terminating L&rsquo; &rsquo;
character, to the array pointed to by dest. Exactly n wide
characters are written at dest. If the length wcslen(src) is
smaller than n, the remaining wide characters in the array
pointed to by dest are filled with L&rsquo; &rsquo;
characters. If the length wcslen(src) is greater or equal to
n, the string pointed to by dest will not be L&rsquo;
&rsquo; terminated.</p>

<p>The strings may not overlap.</p>

<p>The programmer must ensure that there is room for at
least n wide char- acters at dest.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE wcpncpy() returns a pointer to the last
wide character written, that is, dest + n - 1.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This function is a GNU extension.</p>
