<p>POSIX_OPENPT(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
POSIX_OPENPT(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_openpt - open a pseudo-terminal device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_openpt(int oflag);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_openpt() function shall establish
a connection between a mas- ter device for a pseudo-terminal
and a file descriptor. The file descriptor is used by other
I/O functions that refer to that pseudo- terminal.</p>

<p>The file status flags and file access modes of the open
file descrip- tion shall be set according to the value of
oflag.</p>

<p>Values for oflag are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive
OR of flags from the following list, defined in
&lt;fcntl.h&gt;:</p>

<p>O_RDWR Open for reading and writing.</p>

<p>O_NOCTTY If set posix_openpt() shall not cause the
terminal device to become the controlling terminal for the
process.</p>

<p>The behavior of other values for the oflag argument is
unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
posix_openpt() function shall open a master pseudo-terminal
device and return a non-negative integer repre- senting the
lowest numbered unused file descriptor. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_openpt() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>The posix_openpt() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of oflag is not valid.</p>

<p>EAGAIN Out of pseudo-terminal resources.</p>

<p>ENOSR Out of STREAMS resources.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Opening a Pseudo-Terminal and Returning the
Name of the Slave Device and a File Descriptor</p>

<p>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int masterfd, slavefd; char *slavedevice;</p>

<p>masterfd = posix_openpt(O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);</p>

<p>if (masterfd == -1 || grantpt (masterfd) == -1 ||
unlockpt (masterfd) == -1 || (slavedevice = ptsname
(masterfd)) == NULL) return -1;</p>

<p>printf(&quot;slave device is: %n&quot;,
slavedevice);</p>

<p>slavefd = open(slave, O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY); if (slavefd &lt;
0) return -1;</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE This function is a method for portably
obtaining a file descriptor of a master terminal device for
a pseudo-terminal. The grantpt() and ptsname() functions can
be used to manipulate mode and ownership per- missions, and
to obtain the name of the slave device, respectively.</p>

<p>RATIONALE The standard developers considered the matter
of adding a special device for cloning master
pseudo-terminals: the /dev/ptmx device. How- ever, consensus
could not be reached, and it was felt that adding a new
function would permit other implementations. The
posix_openpt() func- tion is designed to complement the
grantpt(), ptsname(), and unlockpt() functions.</p>

<p>On implementations supporting the /dev/ptmx clone
device, opening the master device of a pseudo-terminal is
simply:</p>

<p>mfdp = open(&quot;/dev/ptmx&quot;, oflag ); if (mfdp
&lt; 0) return -1;</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
