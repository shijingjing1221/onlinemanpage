<p>INOTIFY_ADD_WATCH(2) Linux Programmer s Manual
INOTIFY_ADD_WATCH(2)</p>

<p>NAME inotify_add_watch - add a watch to an initialized
inotify instance</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/inotify.h&gt;</p>

<p>int inotify_add_watch(int fd, const char *pathname,
uint32_t mask);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION inotify_add_watch() adds a new watch, or
modifies an existing watch, for the file whose location is
specified in pathname; the caller must have read permission
for this file. The fd argument is a file descrip- tor
referring to the inotify instance whose watch list is to be
modi- fied. The events to be monitored for pathname are
specified in the mask bit-mask argument. See inotify(7) for
a description of the bits that can be set in mask.</p>

<p>A successful call to inotify_add_watch() returns the
unique watch descriptor associated with pathname for this
inotify instance. If pathname was not previously being
watched by this inotify instance, then the watch descriptor
is newly allocated. If pathname was already being watched,
then the descriptor for the existing watch is returned.</p>

<p>The watch descriptor is returned by later read(2)s from
the inotify file descriptor. These reads fetch inotify_event
structures (see ino- tify(7)) indicating file system events;
the watch descriptor inside this structure identifies the
object for which the event occurred.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, inotify_add_watch() returns a
non-negative watch descrip- tor. On error -1 is returned and
errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Read access to the given file is not
permitted.</p>

<p>EBADF The given file descriptor is not valid.</p>

<p>EFAULT pathname points outside of the process s
accessible address space.</p>

<p>EINVAL The given event mask contains no valid events; or
fd is not an inotify file descriptor.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The user limit on the total number of inotify
watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a
needed resource.</p>

<p>VERSIONS Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux
kernel.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO This system call is Linux-specific.</p>
