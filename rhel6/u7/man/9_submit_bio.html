<p>NAME submit_bio - submit a bio to the block device layer
for I/O</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS void submit_bio(int rw, struct bio * bio);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS rw whether to READ or WRITE, or maybe to READA
(read ahead)</p>

<p>bio The struct bio which describes the I/O</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION submit_bio is very similar in purpose to
generic_make_request, and uses that function to do most of
the work. Both are fairly rough interfaces; bio must be
presetup and ready for I/O.</p>
