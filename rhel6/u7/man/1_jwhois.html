<p>NAME jwhois - client for the whois service</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS jwhois [ OPTIONS ]... [ QUERY ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION jwhois searches Whois servers for the object
on the command line.</p>

<p>The host to query is taken from a global configuration
file, a configu- ration file specified on the command line,
or selected directly on the command line.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --version display version, authors and licensing
information.</p>

<p>--help display a short help text.</p>

<p>-c FILE --config=FILE uses FILE as a configuration file
instead of the default.</p>

<p>-h HOST --host=HOST overrides any hosts in the
configuration file and queries HOST directly.</p>

<p>-p PORT --port=PORT specifies a port number to use when
querying a HOST.</p>

<p>-f --force-lookup forces a query to be made to a host
even if a current object is available from the cache.</p>

<p>-v --verbose outputs verbose debugging information while
running (use this before sending a bugreport to ensure that
its indeed a bug and not a misconfiguration). You can
increase the verbosity by giv- ing several verbose commands
to jwhois, such as -vv.</p>

<p>-n --no-redirect disable features that redirect queries
from one server to another.</p>

<p>-s --no-whoisservers disable the built-in support for
whois-servers.net.</p>

<p>-a --raw send query verbatim to receiving hosts instead
of rewriting them according to the configuration.</p>

<p>-i --display-redirections display every step in a
redirection (default is to display only the last
answer).</p>

<p>-d --disable-cache completely disable both reading and
writing to cache.</p>

<p>-r --rwhois force the query to use the rwhois protocoll
instead of HTTP or whois.</p>

<p>--rwhois-display=DISPLAY asks receiving rwhois servers
to display the results in the DIS- PLAY display instead of
the default dump display.</p>

<p>--rwhois-limit=LIMIT asks receiving rwhois servers to
limit their responses to LIMIT matches.</p>

<p>RIPE EXTENSIONS To use the options specified in RIPE
Document 157, you need to change the format of the query
slightly. If you were to search for all entries in the RIPE
database which lists the admin-c, tech-c or zone-c as
CO19-RIPE, you could use the following command syntax:</p>

<p>jwhois -h whois.ripe.net -- -i admin-c,tech-c,zone-c
CO19-RIPE</p>

<p>-- is used to separate the RIPE options from the jwhois
options.</p>
