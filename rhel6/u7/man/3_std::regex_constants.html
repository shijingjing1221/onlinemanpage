syntax_option_type std::regex_constants::awk [static]
Specifies that the grammar recognized by the regular
expression engine is that used by POSIX utility awk in IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001. This option,is identical to
syntax_option_type extended, except that C-style escape
sequences are supported. These sequences are, explicitly,
and (where ddd is one, two, or three octal digits).,
Definition at line 142 of file tr1_impl/regex. &acute; const
syntax_option_type std::regex_constants::basic [staic]
Specifies that the grammar recognized by the regular
expression engine is that used by POSIX basic regular
expressions in IEEE Std 10 03.1-2001, Portable Operating
System Interface (POSIX), Base Defi nitions and Headers,
Section 9, Regular Expressions [IEEE, Informtion Technology
-- Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX), IEEE
Standard 1003.1-2001]. Definition at line 124 of file

<p>const syntax_option_type std::regex_constants::collate
[static] Specifies that character ranges of the form [a-b]
should be locale sensitive. Definition at line 105 of file
tr1_impl/regex.</p>

<p>const syntax_option_type
std::regex_constants::ECMAScript [static] Specifies that the
grammar recognized by the regular expression engine is that
used by ECMAScript in ECMA-262 [Ecma International,
ECMAScript Language Specification, Standard Ecma-262, third
edition, 1999], as modified in tr1 section [7.13]. This
grammar is similar to that defined in the PERL scripting
language but extended with elements found in the POSIX
regular expression grammar. Definition at line 115 of file
tr1_impl/regex.</p>

<p>const syntax_option_type std::regex_constants::egrep
[static] Specifies that the grammar recognized by the
regular expression engine is that used by POSIX utility grep
when given the -E option in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. This
option is identical to syntax_option_type extended, except
that newlines are treated as whitespace. Definition at line
158 of file tr1_impl/regex.</p>

<p>const syntax_option_type std::regex_constants::extended
[static] Specifies that the grammar recognized by the
regular expression engine is that used by POSIX extended
regular expressions in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Portable
Operating System Interface (POSIX), Base Definitions and

132 of file tr1_impl/regex.</p>

<p>const match_flag_type
std::regex_constants::format_default [static] When a regular
expression match is to be replaced by a new string, the new
string is constructed using the rules used by the ECMAScript
replace function in ECMA- 262 [Ecma International,
ECMAScript Language Specification, Standard Ecma-262, third
edition, 1999], part 15.5.4.11 String.prototype.replace. In
addition, during search and replace operations all
non-overlapping occurrences of the regular expression are
located and replaced, and sections of the input that did not
match the expression are copied unchanged to the output
string. Format strings (from ECMA-262 [15.5.4.11]):</p>

<p>&middot; $$ The dollar-sign itself ($) &middot; $&amp;
The matched substring. &middot; $ The portion of string that
precedes the matched substring. This would be
match_results::prefix(). &middot; $ The portion of string
that follows the matched substring. This would be
match_results::suffix(). &middot; $n The nth capture, where
n is in [1,9] and $n is not followed by a decimal digit. If
n &lt;= match_results::size() and the nth capture is
undefined, use the empty string instead. If n &gt;
match_results::size(), the result is implementation-defined.
&middot; $nn The nnth capture, where nn is a two-digit
decimal number on [01, 99]. If nn &lt;=
match_results::size() and the nth capture is undefined, use
the empty string instead. If nn &gt; match_results::size(),
the result is implementation-defined.</p>

match_flag_type std::regex_constants::format_first_only
[static] When specified during a search and replace
operation, only the first occurrence of the regular
expression shall be replaced. Definition at line 299 of file
tr1_impl/regex. const match_flag_type
std::regex_constants::format_no_copy [static] During a
search and replace operation, sections of the character
container sequence being searched that do not match the
regular expression shall not be copied to the output string.
Definition at line 293 of file tr1_impl/regex. const
match_flag_type std::regex_constants::format_sed [static]
When a regular expression match is to be replaced by a new
string, the new string is constructed using the rules used
by the POSIX sed utility in IEEE Std 1003.1- 2001 [IEEE,
Information Technology -- Portable Operating System
Interface (POSIX), IEEE Standard 1003.1-2001]. Definition at
