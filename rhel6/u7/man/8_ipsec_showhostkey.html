<p>IPSEC_SHOWHOSTKEY(8) [FIXME: manual]
IPSEC_SHOWHOSTKEY(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_showhostkey - show host&acute;s
authentication key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipsec showhostkey [--ipseckey [gateway]]
[--left] [--right] [--dump] [--verbose] [--version] [--list]
[--x509self] [--x509req] [--x509cert] [--txt gateway]
[--dhclient] [--file secretfile] [--keynum count] [--id
identity]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Showhostkey outputs (on standard output) a
public key suitable for this host, in the format specified,
using the host key information stored in /etc/ipsec.secrets.
In general only the super-user can run this command, since
only he can read ipsec.secrets.</p>

<p>The --txt option causes the output to be in
opportunistic-encryption DNS TXT record format, with the
specified gateway value. If information about how the key
was generated is available, that is provided as a DNS-file
comment. For example, --txt 10.11.12.13 might give (with the
key data trimmed for clarity):</p>

<p>; RSA 2048 bits xy.example.com Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
IN TXT &quot;X-IPsec-Server(10)=10.11.12.13
AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/&quot;</p>

<p>No name is supplied in the TXT record because there are
too many possibilities, depending on how it will be used. If
the text string is longer than 255 bytes, it is split up
into multiple strings (matching the restrictions of the DNS
TXT binary format). If any split is needed, the first split
will be at the start of the key: this increases the chances
that later hand editing will work.</p>

<p>The --version option causes the version of the binary to
be emitted, and nothing else.</p>

<p>The --verbose may be present one or more times. Each
occurance increases the verbosity level.</p>

<p>The --left and --right options cause the output to be in
ipsec.conf(5) format, as a leftrsasigkey or rightrsasigkey
parameter respectively. Again, generation information is
included if available. For example, --left might give (with
the key data trimmed down for clarity):</p>

<p># RSA 2048 bits xy.example.com Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
leftrsasigkey=0sAQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/</p>

<p>The --dhclient option cause the output to be suitable
for inclusion in dhclient.conf(5) as part of configuring
WAVEsec. See &lt;http://www.wavesec.org&gt;.</p>

<p>If --ipseckey is specified, the output format is the
text form of a DNS IPSECKEY record (see RFC4025); the host
name is the one included in the key information (or, if that
is not available, the output of hostname --fqdn), with a .
appended. The gateway information, if provided, is is
included, otherwise, the gateway is assumed to be self, and
to be of type FQDN. Generation information is included if
available. For example (with the key data trimmed down for
clarity):</p>

<p>; RSA 2048 bits xy.example.com Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
xy.example.com. IN IPSECKEYKEY floyd albert</p>

<p>; RSA 2048 bits xy.example.com Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
xy.example.com. IN KEY 0x4200 4 1 AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/</p>

<p>Normally, the default key for this host (the one with no
host identities specified for it) is the one extracted. The
--id option overrides this, causing extraction of the key
labeled with the specified identity, if any. The specified
identity must exactly match the identity in the file; in
particular, the comparison is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>There may also be multiple keys with the same identity.
All keys are numbered based upon their linear sequence in
the file (including all include directives)</p>

<p>The --file option overrides the default for where the
key information should be found, and takes it from the
specified secretfile.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS A complaint about no pubkey line found
indicates that the host has a key but it was generated with
an old version of FreeS/WAN and does not contain the
information that showhostkey needs.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/ipsec.secrets</p>

<p>HISTORY Written for the Linux FreeS/WAN project
&lt;http://www.freeswan.org&gt; by Henry Spencer.</p>

<p>BUGS Arguably, rather than just reporting the
no-IN-KEY-line-found problem, showhostkey should be smart
enough to run the existing key through rsasigkey with the
--oldkey option, to generate a suitable output line.</p>

<p>The need to specify the gateway address (etc.) for --txt
is annoying, but there is no good way to determine it
automatically.</p>

<p>There should be a way to specify the priority value for
TXT records; currently it is hardwired to 10.</p>

<p>The --id option assumes that the identity appears on the
same line as the : RSA { that begins the key proper.</p>
