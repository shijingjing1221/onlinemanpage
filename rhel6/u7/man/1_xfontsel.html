<p>XFONTSEL(1) XFONTSEL(1)</p>

<p>NAME xfontsel - point and click selection of X11 font
names</p>

<p>SYNTAX xfontsel [-toolkitoption ...] [-pattern fontname]
[-print] [-sample text] [-sample16 text16] [-sampleUCS
textUCS] [-scaled]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xfontsel application provides a simple
way to display the fonts known to your X server, examine
samples of each, and retrieve the X Logical Font Description
(&quot;XLFD&quot;) full name for a font.</p>

<p>If -pattern is not specified, all fonts with XLFD
14-part names will be selectable. To work with only a subset
of the fonts, specify -pattern followed by a partially or
fully qualified font name; e.g., -pattern *medium* will
select that subset of fonts which contain the string medium
somewhere in their font name. Be careful about escaping
wildcard characters in your shell.</p>

<p>If -print is specified on the command line the selected
font specifier will be written to standard output when the
quit button is activated. Regardless of whether or not
-print was specified, the font specifier may be made the
PRIMARY (text) selection by activating the select but-
ton.</p>

<p>The -sample option specifies the sample text to be used
to display the selected font if the font is linearly
indexed, overriding the default.</p>

<p>The -sample16 option specifies the sample text to be
used to display the selected font if the font is matrix
encoded, overriding the default.</p>

<p>The -sampleUCS option specifies the sample text encoded
in the UTF-8 form to be used to display the selected font if
the font has a CHARSET_REGISTRY of ISO10646, overriding the
default.</p>

<p>The -scaled option enables the ability to select scaled
fonts at arbi- trary pixel or point sizes.</p>

<p>INTERACTIONS Clicking any pointer button in one of the
XLFD field names will pop up a menu of the currently-known
possibilities for that field. If previ- ous choices of other
fields were made, only values for fonts which matched the
previously selected fields will be selectable; to make other
values selectable, you must deselect some other field(s) by
choosing the * entry in that field. Unselectable values may
be omitted from the menu entirely as a configuration option;
see the ShowUnselectable resource, below. Whenever any
change is made to a field value, xfontsel will assert
ownership of the PRIMARY_FONT selec- tion. Other
applications (see, e.g., xterm) may then retrieve the
selected font specification.</p>

<p>Scalable fonts come back from the server with zero for
the pixel size, point size, and average width fields.
Selecting a font name with a zero in these positions results
in an implementation-dependent size. Any pixel or point size
can be selected to scale the font to a particu- lar size.
Any average width can be selected to anamorphically scale
the font (although you may find this challenging given the
size of the average width menu).</p>

<p>Clicking the left pointer button in the select widget
will cause the currently selected font name to become the
PRIMARY text selection as well as the PRIMARY_FONT
selection. This then allows you to paste the string into
other applications. The select button remains highlighted to
remind you of this fact, and de-highlights when some other
applica- tion takes the PRIMARY selection away. The select
widget is a toggle; pressing it when it is highlighted will
cause xfontsel to release the selection ownership and
de-highlight the widget. Activating the select widget twice
is the only way to cause xfontsel to release the PRI-
MARY_FONT selection.</p>

<p>RESOURCES The application class is XFontSel. Most of the
user-interface is con- figured in the app-defaults file; if
this file is missing a warning message will be printed to
standard output and the resulting window will be nearly
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Most of the significant parts of the widget hierarchy
are documented in /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XFontSel,</p>

<p>Application specific resources:</p>

<p>cursor (class Cursor) Specifies the cursor for the
application window.</p>

<p>pattern (class Pattern) Specifies the font name pattern
for selecting a subset of available fonts. Equivalent to the
-pattern option. Most use- ful patterns will contain at
least one field delimiter; e.g. *-m-* for monospaced
fonts.</p>

<p>pixelSizeList (class PixelSizeList) Specifies a list of
pixel sizes to add to the pixel size menu, so that scalable
fonts can be selected at those pixel sizes. The default
pixelSizeList contains 7, 30, 40, 50, and 60.</p>

<p>pointSizeList (class PointSizeList) Specifies a list of
point sizes (in units of tenths of points) to add to the
point size menu, so that scalable fonts can be selected at
those point sizes. The default pointSizeList con- tains 250,
300, 350, and 400.</p>

<p>printOnQuit (class PrintOnQuit) If True the currently
selected font name is printed to standard output when the
quit button is activated. Equivalent to the -print
option.</p>

<p>sampleText (class Text) The sample 1-byte text to use
for linearly indexed fonts. Each glyph index is a single
byte, with newline separating lines.</p>

<p>sampleText16 (class Text16) The sample 2-byte text to
use for matrix-encoded fonts. Each glyph index is two bytes,
with a 1-byte newline separating lines.</p>

<p>scaledFonts (class ScaledFonts) If True then selection
of arbitrary pixel and point sizes for scalable fonts is
enabled.</p>

<p>Widget specific resources:</p>

<p>showUnselectable (class ShowUnselectable) Specifies, for
each field menu, whether or not to show values that are not
currently selectable, based upon previous field selections.
If shown, the unselectable values are clearly identified as
such and do not highlight when the pointer is moved down the
menu. The full name of this resource is
fieldN.menu.options.showUnselectable, class
MenuButton.Simple- Menu.Options.ShowUnselectable; where N is
replaced with the field number (starting with the left-most
field numbered 0). The default is True for all but field 11
(average width of characters in font) and False for field
11. If you never want to see unselectable entries,
*menu.options.showUnse- lectable:False is a reasonable thing
to specify in a resource file.</p>

<p>FILES $XFILESEARCHPATH/XFontSel</p>

<p>SEE ALSO xrdb(1), xfd(1)</p>

<p>BUGS Sufficiently ambiguous patterns can be
misinterpreted and lead to an initial selection string which
may not correspond to what the user intended and which may
cause the initial sample text output to fail to match the
proffered string. Selecting any new field value will correct
the sample output, though possibly resulting in no matching
font.</p>

<p>Should be able to return a FONT for the PRIMARY
selection, not just a STRING.</p>

<p>Any change in a field value will cause xfontsel to
assert ownership of the PRIMARY_FONT selection. Perhaps this
should be parameterized.</p>

<p>When running on a slow machine, it is possible for the
user to request a field menu before the font names have been
completely parsed. An error message indicating a missing
menu is printed to stderr but other- wise nothing bad (or
good) happens.</p>

<p>The average-width menu is too large to be useful.</p>
