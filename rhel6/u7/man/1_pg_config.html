<p>PG_CONFIG(1) PostgreSQL Client Applications
PG_CONFIG(1)</p>

<p>NAME pg_config - retrieve information about the
installed version of Post- greSQL</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pg_config [ option... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pg_config utility prints configuration
parameters of the currently installed version of PostgreSQL.
It is intended, for example, to be used by software packages
that want to interface to PostgreSQL to facilitate finding
the required header files and libraries.</p>

<p>OPTIONS To use pg_config, supply one or more of the
following options:</p>

<p>--bindir Print the location of user executables. Use
this, for example, to find the psql program. This is
normally also the location where the pg_config program
resides.</p>

<p>--docdir Print the location of documentation files.</p>

<p>--htmldir Print the location of HTML documentation
files.</p>

<p>--includedir Print the location of C header files of the
client interfaces.</p>

<p>--pkgincludedir Print the location of other C header
files.</p>

<p>--includedir-server Print the location of C header files
for server programming.</p>

<p>--libdir Print the location of object code
libraries.</p>

<p>--pkglibdir Print the location of dynamically loadable
modules, or where the server would search for them. (Other
architecture-dependent data files might also be installed in
this directory.)</p>

<p>--localedir Print the location of locale support files.
(This will be an empty string if locale support was not
configured when Post- greSQL was built.)</p>

<p>--mandir Print the location of manual pages.</p>

<p>--sharedir Print the location of
architecture-independent support files.</p>

<p>--sysconfdir Print the location of system-wide
configuration files.</p>

<p>--pgxs Print the location of extension makefiles.</p>

<p>--configure Print the options that were given to the
configure script when PostgreSQL was configured for
building. This can be used to reproduce the identical
configuration, or to find out with what options a binary
package was built. (Note however that binary packages often
contain vendor-specific custom patches.) See also the
examples below.</p>

<p>--cc Print the value of the CC variable that was used
for building PostgreSQL. This shows the C compiler used.</p>

<p>--cppflags Print the value of the CPPFLAGS variable that
was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows C compiler
switches needed at preprocessing time (typically, -I
switches).</p>

<p>--cflags Print the value of the CFLAGS variable that was
used for build- ing PostgreSQL. This shows C compiler
switches.</p>

<p>--cflags_sl Print the value of the CFLAGS_SL variable
that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows extra C
compiler switches used for building shared libraries.</p>

<p>--ldflags Print the value of the LDFLAGS variable that
was used for build- ing PostgreSQL. This shows linker
switches.</p>

<p>--ldflags_sl Print the value of the LDFLAGS_SL variable
that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows linker
switches used for build- ing shared libraries.</p>

<p>--libs Print the value of the LIBS variable that was
used for building PostgreSQL. This normally contains -l
switches for external libraries linked into PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>--version Print the version of PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>If more than one option is given, the information is
printed in that order, one item per line. If no options are
given, all available infor- mation is printed, with
labels.</p>

<p>NOTES The option --includedir-server was new in
PostgreSQL 7.2. In prior releases, the server include files
were installed in the same location as the client headers,
which could be queried with the option --includedir. To make
your package handle both cases, try the newer option first
and test the exit status to see whether it succeeded.</p>

<p>The options --docdir, --pkgincludedir, --localedir,
--mandir, --sharedir, --sysconfdir, --cc, --cppflags,
--cflags, --cflags_sl, --ldflags, --ldflags_sl, and --libs
are new in PostgreSQL 8.1. The option --htmldir is new in
PostgreSQL 8.4.</p>

<p>In releases prior to PostgreSQL 7.1, before pg_config
came to be, a method for finding the equivalent
configuration information did not exist.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE To reproduce the build configuration of the
current PostgreSQL instal- lation, run the following
command:</p>

<p>eval ./configure pg_config --configure</p>

<p>The output of pg_config --configure contains shell
quotation marks so arguments with spaces are represented
correctly. Therefore, using eval is required for proper
results.</p>
