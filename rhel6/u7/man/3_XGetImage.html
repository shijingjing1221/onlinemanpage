<p>XPutImage(3) XLIB FUNCTIONS XPutImage(3)</p>

<p>NAME XPutImage, XGetImage, XGetSubImage - transfer
images</p>

<p>SYNTAX int XPutImage(Display *display, Drawable d, GC
gc, XImage *image, int src_x, int src_y, int dest_x, int
dest_y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height);</p>

<p>XImage *XGetImage(Display *display, Drawable d, int x,
int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned
long plane_mask, int format);</p>

<p>XImage *XGetSubImage(Display *display, Drawable d, int
x, int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, unsigned
long plane_mask, int format, XImage *dest_image, int dest_x,
dest_y);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS d Specifies the drawable.</p>

<p>dest_image Specifies the destination image.</p>

<p>dest_x dest_y Specify the x and y coordinates, which are
relative to the origin of the drawable and are the
coordinates of the subim- age or which are relative to the
origin of the destination rectangle, specify its upper-left
corner, and determine where the subimage is placed in the
destination image.</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>format Specifies the format for the image. You can pass
XYPixmap or ZPixmap.</p>

<p>gc Specifies the GC.</p>

<p>image Specifies the image you want combined with the
rectangle.</p>

<p>plane_mask Specifies the plane mask.</p>

<p>src_x Specifies the offset in X from the left edge of
the image defined by the XImage structure.</p>

<p>src_y Specifies the offset in Y from the top edge of the
image defined by the XImage structure.</p>

<p>width height Specify the width and height of the
subimage, which define the dimensions of the rectangle.</p>

<p>x y Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative
to the origin of the drawable and define the upper-left
corner of the rectangle.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XPutImage function combines an image
with a rectangle of the speci- fied drawable. The section of
the image defined by the src_x, src_y, width, and height
arguments is drawn on the specified part of the draw- able.
If XYBitmap format is used, the depth of the image must be
one, or a BadMatch error results. The foreground pixel in
the GC defines the source for the one bits in the image, and
the background pixel defines the source for the zero bits.
For XYPixmap and ZPixmap, the depth of the image must match
the depth of the drawable, or a BadMatch error results.</p>

<p>If the characteristics of the image (for example,
byte_order and bitmap_unit) differ from what the server
requires, XPutImage automati- cally makes the appropriate
conversions.</p>

<p>This function uses these GC components: function,
plane-mask, subwin- dow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin,
and clip-mask. It also uses these GC mode-dependent
components: foreground and background.</p>

<p>XPutImage can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XGetImage function returns a pointer to an XImage
structure. This structure provides you with the contents of
the specified rectangle of the drawable in the format you
specify. If the format argument is XYP- ixmap, the image
contains only the bit planes you passed to the plane_mask
argument. If the plane_mask argument only requests a subset
of the planes of the display, the depth of the returned
image will be the number of planes requested. If the format
argument is ZPixmap, XGetImage returns as zero the bits in
all planes not specified in the plane_mask argument. The
function performs no range checking on the values in
plane_mask and ignores extraneous bits.</p>

<p>XGetImage returns the depth of the image to the depth
member of the XImage structure. The depth of the image is as
specified when the drawable was created, except when getting
a subset of the planes in XYPixmap format, when the depth is
given by the number of bits set to 1 in plane_mask.</p>

<p>If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be
wholly con- tained within the pixmap, or a BadMatch error
results. If the drawable is a window, the window must be
viewable, and it must be the case that if there were no
inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified rect- angle
of the window would be fully visible on the screen and
wholly contained within the outside edges of the window, or
a BadMatch error results. Note that the borders of the
window can be included and read with this request. If the
window has backing-store, the backing-store contents are
returned for regions of the window that are obscured by
noninferior windows. If the window does not have
backing-store, the returned contents of such obscured
regions are undefined. The returned contents of visible
regions of inferiors of a different depth than the specified
windows depth are also undefined. The pointer cursor image
is not included in the returned contents. If a problem
occurs, XGetIm- age returns NULL.</p>

<p>XGetImage can generate BadDrawable, BadMatch, and
BadValue errors.</p>

<p>The XGetSubImage function updates dest_image with the
specified subim- age in the same manner as XGetImage. If the
format argument is XYP- ixmap, the image contains only the
bit planes you passed to the plane_mask argument. If the
format argument is ZPixmap, XGetSubImage returns as zero the
bits in all planes not specified in the plane_mask argument.
The function performs no range checking on the values in
plane_mask and ignores extraneous bits. As a convenience,
XGetSubImage returns a pointer to the same XImage structure
specified by dest_image.</p>

<p>The depth of the destination XImage structure must be
the same as that of the drawable. If the specified subimage
does not fit at the speci- fied location on the destination
image, the right and bottom edges are clipped. If the
drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be wholly
contained within the pixmap, or a BadMatch error results. If
the drawable is a window, the window must be viewable, and
it must be the case that if there were no inferiors or
overlapping windows, the specified rectangle of the window
would be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained
within the outside edges of the window, or a Bad- Match
error results. If the window has backing-store, then the
back- ing-store contents are returned for regions of the
window that are obscured by noninferior windows. If the
window does not have backing- store, the returned contents
of such obscured regions are undefined. The returned
contents of visible regions of inferiors of a different
depth than the specified windows depth are also undefined.
If a prob- lem occurs, XGetSubImage returns NULL.</p>

<p>XGetSubImage can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch,
and BadValue errors.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDrawable A value for a Drawable argument
does not name a defined Win- dow or Pixmap.</p>

<p>BadGC A value for a GContext argument does not name a
defined GCon- text.</p>

<p>BadMatch An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.</p>

<p>BadMatch Some argument or pair of arguments has the
correct type and range but fails to match in some other way
required by the request.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set
of alternatives can generate this error.</p>
