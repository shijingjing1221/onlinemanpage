<p>NAME sssd - System Security Services Daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sssd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage
access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms.
It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a
pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different
account sources as well as D-Bus interface. It is also the
basis to provide client auditing and policy services for
projects like FreeIPA. It provides a more robust database to
store local users as well as extended user data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d,--debug-level LEVEL SSSD supports two
representations for specifying the debug level. The simplest
is to specify a decimal value from 0-9, which represents
enabling that level and all lower-level debug messages. The
more comprehensive option is to specify a hexadecimal
bitmask to enable or disable specific levels (such as if you
wish to suppress a level).</p>

<p>Currently supported debug levels:</p>

<p>0, 0x0010: Fatal failures. Anything that would prevent
SSSD from starting up or causes it to cease running.</p>

<p>1, 0x0020: Critical failures. An error that
doesn&acute;t kill the SSSD, but one that indicates that at
least one major feature is not going to work properly.</p>

<p>2, 0x0040: Serious failures. An error announcing that a
particular request or operation has failed.</p>

<p>3, 0x0080: Minor failures. These are the errors that
would percolate down to cause the operation failure of
2.</p>

<p>4, 0x0100: Configuration settings.</p>

<p>5, 0x0200: Function data.</p>

<p>6, 0x0400: Trace messages for operation functions.</p>

<p>7, 0x1000: Trace messages for internal control
functions.</p>

<p>8, 0x2000: Contents of function-internal variables that
may be interesting.</p>

<p>9, 0x4000: Extremely low-level tracing information.</p>

<p>To log required bitmask debug levels, simply add their
numbers together as shown in following examples:</p>

<p>Example: To log fatal failures, critical failures,
serious failures and function data use 0x0270.</p>

<p>Example: To log fatal failures, configuration settings,
function data, trace messages for internal control functions
use 0x1310.</p>

<p>Note: The bitmask format of debug levels was introduced
in 1.7.0.</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>--debug-timestamps=mode</p>

<p>1: Add a timestamp to the debug messages</p>

<p>0: Disable timestamp in the debug messages</p>

<p>Default: 1</p>

<p>--debug-microseconds=mode</p>

<p>1: Add microseconds to the timestamp in debug
messages</p>

<p>0: Disable microseconds in timestamp</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>-f,--debug-to-files Send the debug output to files
instead of stderr. By default, the log files are stored in
/var/log/sssd and there are separate log files for every
SSSD service and domain.</p>

<p>-D,--daemon Become a daemon after starting up.</p>

<p>-i,--interactive Run in the foreground, don&acute;t
become a daemon.</p>

<p>-c,--config Specify a non-default config file. The
default is /etc/sssd/sssd.conf. For reference on the config
file syntax and options, consult the sssd.conf(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>-?,--help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>--version Print version number and exit.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGTERM/SIGINT Informs the SSSD to gracefully
terminate all of its child processes and then shut down the
monitor.</p>

<p>SIGHUP Tells the SSSD to stop writing to its current
debug file descriptors and to close and reopen them. This is
meant to facilitate log rolling with programs like
logrotate.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 Tells the SSSD to simulate offline operation for
the duration of the offline_timeout parameter. This is
useful for testing. The signal can be sent to either the
sssd process or any sssd_be process directly.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 Tells the SSSD to go online immediately. This is
useful for testing. The signal can be sent to either the
sssd process or any sssd_be process directly.</p>

<p>NOTES If the environment variable SSS_NSS_USE_MEMCACHE
is set to &quot;NO&quot;, client applications will not use
the fast in memory cache.</p>
