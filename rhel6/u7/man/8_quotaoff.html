<p>QUOTAON(8) QUOTAON(8)</p>

<p>NAME quotaon, quotaoff - turn filesystem quotas on and
off</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS /sbin/quotaon [ -vugfp ] [ -F format-name ]
filesystem... /sbin/quotaon [ -avugfp ] [ -F format-name
]</p>

<p>/sbin/quotaoff [ -vugp ] [ -x state ] filesystem...
/sbin/quotaoff [ -avugp ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION quotaon quotaon announces to the system that
disk quotas should be enabled on one or more filesystems.
The filesystem quota files must be present in the root
directory of the specified filesystem and be named either
aquota.user (for version 2 user quota), quota.user (for
version 1 user quota), aquota.group (for version 2 group
quota), or quota.group (for version 1 group quota).</p>

<p>XFS filesystems are a special case - XFS considers quota
information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to
provide a higher level guar- antee of consistency. There are
two components to the XFS disk quota system: accounting and
limit enforcement. XFS filesystems require that quota
accounting be turned on at mount time. It is possible to
enable and disable limit enforcement on an XFS filesystem
after quota account- ing is already turned on. The default
is to turn on both accounting and enforcement.</p>

<p>The XFS quota implementation does not maintain quota
information in user-visible files, but rather stores this
information internally.</p>

<p>quotaoff quotaoff announces to the system that the
specified filesystems should have any disk quotas turned
off.</p>

<p>OPTIONS quotaon -F, --format=format-name Report quota
for specified format (ie. don t perform format
autodetection). Possible format names are: vfsold Original
quota format with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota format
with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit inode
usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit quota
limits and usage, xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)</p>

<p>-a, --all All automatically mounted (no noauto option)
non-NFS filesystems in /etc/fstab with quotas will have
their quotas turned on. This is normally used at boot time
to enable quotas.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Display a message for each filesystem
where quotas are turned on.</p>

<p>-u, --user Manipulate user quotas. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-g, --group Manipulate group quotas.</p>

<p>-p, --print-state Instead of turning quotas on just
print state of quotas (ie. whether. quota is on or off)</p>

<p>-f, --off Make quotaon behave like being called as
quotaoff.</p>

<p>quotaoff -F, --format=format-name Report quota for
specified format (ie. dont perform format autodetection).
Possible format names are: vfsold (version 1 quota), vfsv0
(version 2 quota), xfs (quota on XFS filesystem)</p>

<p>-a, --all Force all filesystems in /etc/fstab to have
their quotas dis- abled.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Display a message for each filesystem
affected.</p>

<p>-u, --user Manipulate user quotas. This is the
default.</p>

<p>-g, --group Manipulate group quotas.</p>

<p>-p, --print-state Instead of turning quotas off just
print state of quotas (ie. whether. quota is on or off)</p>

<p>-x, --xfs-command delete Free up the space used to hold
quota information (maintained internally) within XFS. This
option is only applicable to XFS, and is silently ignored
for other filesystem types. It can only be used on a
filesystem with quota previously turned off.</p>

<p>-x, --xfs-command enforce Switch on/off limit
enforcement for XFS filesystems (perform quota accounting
only). This option is only applicable to XFS, and is
silently ignored for other filesystem types.</p>

<p>NOTES ON XFS FILESYSTEMS To enable quotas on an XFS
filesystem, use mount(8) or /etc/fstab quota option to
enable both accounting and limit enforcement. quotaon util-
ity cannot be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Turning on quotas on an XFS root filesystem requires the
quota mount options be passed into the kernel at boot time
through the Linux root- flags boot option.</p>

<p>To turn off quota limit enforcement on any XFS
filesystem, first make sure that quota accounting and
enforcement are both turned on using repquota -v filesystem.
Then, use quotaoff -v filesystem to disable limit
enforcement. This may be done while the filesystem is
mounted.</p>

<p>Turning on quota limit enforcement on an XFS filesystem
is achieved using quotaon -v filesystem. This may be done
while the filesystem is mounted.</p>

<p>FILES aquota.user or aquota.group quota file at the
filesystem root (version 2 quota, non-XFS filesystems)
quota.user or quota.group quota file at the filesystem root
(version 1 quota, non-XFS filesystems) /etc/fstab default
filesystems</p>
