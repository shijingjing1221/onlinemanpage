<p>SDL_KeyboardEvent(3) SDL API Reference
SDL_KeyboardEvent(3)</p>

<p>NAME SDL_KeyboardEvent - Keyboard event structure</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DEFINITION typedef struct{ Uint8 type; Uint8
state; SDL_keysym keysym; } SDL_KeyboardEvent;</p>

<p>STRUCTURE DATA type SDL_KEYDOWN or SDL_KEYUP</p>

<p>state SDL_PRESSED or SDL_RELEASED</p>

<p>keysym Contains key press information</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SDL_KeyboardEvent is a member of the
SDL_Event union and is used when an event of type
SDL_KEYDOWN or SDL_KEYUP is reported.</p>

<p>The type and state actually report the same information,
they just use different values to do it! A keyboard event
occurs when a key is released (type=SDK_KEYUP or
state=SDL_RELEASED) and when a key is pressed
(type=SDL_KEYDOWN or state=SDL_PRESSED). The information on
what key was pressed or released is in the keysym
structure.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Repeating SDL_KEYDOWN events will occur if key repeat is
enabled (see SDL_EnableKeyRepeat).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO SDL_Event, SDL_keysym, SDL_EnableKeyRepeat,
SDL_EnableUNICODE</p>
