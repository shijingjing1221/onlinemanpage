<p>DDATE(1) Emperor Norton Utilities DDATE(1)</p>

<p>NAME ddate - converts Gregorian dates to Discordian
dates</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ddate [+format] [date]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION ddate prints the date in Discordian date
format.</p>

<p>If called with no arguments, ddate will get the current
system date, convert this to the Discordian date format and
print this on the stan- dard output. Alternatively, a
Gregorian date may be specified on the command line, in the
form of a numerical day, month and year.</p>

<p>If a format string is specified, the Discordian date
will be printed in a format specified by the string. This
mechanism works similarly to the format string mechanism of
date(1), only almost completely differently. The fields
are:</p>

<p>%A Full name of the day of the week (i.e.,
Sweetmorn)</p>

<p>%a Abbreviated name of the day of the week (i.e.,
SM)</p>

<p>%B Full name of the season (i.e., Chaos)</p>

<p>%b Abbreviated name of the season (i.e., Chs)</p>

<p>%d Ordinal number of day in season (i.e., 23)</p>

<p>%e Cardinal number of day in season (i.e., 23rd)</p>

<p>%H Name of current Holyday, if any</p>

<p>%N Magic code to prevent rest of format from being
printed unless today is a Holyday.</p>

<p>%n Newline</p>

<p>%t Tab</p>

<p>%X Number of days remaining until X-Day. (Not valid if
the SubGe- nius options are not compiled in.)</p>

<p>%{</p>

<p>%} Used to enclose the part of the string which is to be
replaced with the words &quot;St. Tibs Day&quot; if the
current day is St. Tibs Day.</p>

<p>%. Try it and see.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES % ddate Sweetmorn, Bureaucracy 42, 3161
YOLD</p>

<p>% ddate +Today is %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y.
%N%nCelebrate %H Today is Sweetmorn, the 42nd of
Bureaucracy, 3161.</p>

<p>% ddate +&quot;Its %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y.
%N%nCelebrate %H&quot; 26 9 1995 Its Prickle-Prickle, the
50th of Bureaucracy, 3161. Celebrate Bureflux</p>

<p>% ddate +&quot;Todays %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y.
%N%nCelebrate %H&quot; 29 2 1996 Todays St. Tibs Day,
3162.</p>

<p>BUGS ddate(1) will produce undefined behaviour if asked
to produce the date for St. Tib s day and its format string
does not contain the St. Tibs Day delimiters %{ and %}.</p>

<p>NOTE After X-Day passed without incident, the Church of
the SubGenius declared that it had got the year upside down
- X-Day is actually in 8661 AD rather than 1998 AD. Thus,
the True X-Day is Cfn 40, 9827.</p>
