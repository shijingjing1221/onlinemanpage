<p>POSIX_TRACE_EVENTID_EQUAL(3POSIX Programmer s
ManPOSIX_TRACE_EVENTID_EQUAL(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME posix_trace_eventid_equal,
posix_trace_eventid_get_name, posix_trace_trid_eventid_open
- manipulate the trace event type identi- fier (TRACING)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;trace.h&gt;</p>

<p>int posix_trace_eventid_equal(trace_id_t trid,
trace_event_id_t event1, trace_event_id_t event2); int
posix_trace_eventid_get_name(trace_id_t trid,
trace_event_id_t event, char *event_name);</p>

<p>int posix_trace_trid_eventid_open(trace_id_t trid, const
char *restrict event_name, trace_event_id_t *restrict
event);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The posix_trace_eventid_equal() function
shall compare the trace event type identifiers event1 and
event2 from the same trace stream or the same trace log
identified by the trid argument. If the trace event type
identifiers event1 and event2 are from different trace
streams, the return value shall be unspecified.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventid_get_name() function shall
return, in the argu- ment pointed to by event_name, the
trace event name associated with the trace event type
identifier identified by the argument event, for the trace
stream or for the trace log identified by the trid argument.
The name of the trace event shall have a maximum of
{TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has the minimum
value {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}). Successive calls to
this function with the same trace event type iden- tifier
and the same trace stream identifier shall return the same
event name.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() function shall
associate a user trace event name with a trace event type
identifier for a given trace stream. The trace stream is
identified by the trid argument, and it shall be an active
trace stream. The trace event name is the string pointed to
by the argument event_name. It shall have a maximum of
{TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has the minimum
value {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}). The number of user
trace event type identifiers that can be defined for any
given process is limited by the maximum value
{TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which has the minimum value
{_POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.</p>

<p>If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the
posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() function shall associate the
user trace event name pointed to by the event_name argument
with a trace event type identifier that is unique for the
process being traced in the trace stream identified by the
trid argument, and is returned in the variable pointed to by
the event argument. If the user trace event name has already
been mapped for the traced process, then the previously
assigned trace event type identifier shall be returned. If
the per-pro- cess user trace event name limit represented by
{TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-defined
POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see Trace Option: User Trace
Event ) user trace event shall be returned.</p>

<p>If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the
posix_trace_trid_even- tid_open() function shall associate
the user trace event name pointed to by the event_name
argument with a trace event type identifier that is unique
for all the processes being traced in the trace stream iden-
tified by the trid argument, and is returned in the variable
pointed to by the event argument. If the user trace event
name has already been mapped for the traced processes, then
the previously assigned trace event type identifier shall be
returned. If the per-process user trace event name limit
represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the
pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see Trace Option:
User Trace Event ) user trace event shall be returned.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, the
posix_trace_eventid_get_name() and
posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() functions shall return a
value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the
corresponding error number.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventid_equal() function shall return a
non-zero value if event1 and event2 are equal; otherwise, a
value of zero shall be returned. No errors are defined. If
either event1 or event2 are not valid trace event type
identifiers for the trace stream specified by trid or if the
trid is invalid, the behavior shall be unspecified.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventid_get_name() function stores the
trace event name value in the object pointed to by
event_name, if successful.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() function stores the
trace event type identifier value in the object pointed to
by event, if successful.</p>

<p>ERRORS The posix_trace_eventid_get_name() and
posix_trace_trid_even- tid_open() functions shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The trid argument was not a valid trace stream
identifier.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG</p>

<p>The size of the name pointed to by the event_name
argument was longer than the implementation-defined value
{TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>The posix_trace_eventid_get_name() function shall fail
if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The trace event type identifier event was not
associated with any name.</p>
