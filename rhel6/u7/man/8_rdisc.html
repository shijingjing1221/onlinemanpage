<p>RDISC(8) System Manager s Manual: iputils RDISC(8)</p>

<p>NAME rdisc - network router discovery daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rdisc [ -abdfstvV] [ send_address] [
receive_address]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rdisc implements client side of the ICMP
router discover protocol. rdisc is invoked at boot time to
populate the network routing tables with default routes.</p>

<p>rdisc listens on the ALL_HOSTS (224.0.0.1) multicast
address (or receive_address provided it is given) for
ROUTER_ADVERTISE messages from routers. The received
messages are handled by first ignoring those listed router
addresses with which the host does not share a network.
Among the remaining addresses the ones with the highest
preference are selected as default routers and a default
route is entered in the ker- nel routing table for each one
of them.</p>

<p>Optionally, rdisc can avoid waiting for routers to
announce themselves by sending out a few ROUTER_SOLICITATION
messages to the ALL_ROUTERS (224.0.0.2) multicast address
(or send_address provided it is given) when it is
started.</p>

<p>A timer is associated with each router address and the
address will no longer be considered for inclusion in the
the routing tables if the timer expires before a new
advertise message is received from the router. The address
will also be excluded from consideration if the host
receives an advertise message with the preference being
maximally negative.</p>

<p>Server side of router discovery protocol is supported by
Cisco IOS and by any more or less complete UNIX routing
daemon, f.e gated.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Accept all routers independently of the
preference they have in their advertise messages. Normally
rdisc only accepts (and enters in the kernel routing tables)
the router or routers with the highest preference.</p>

<p>-b Opposite to -a, i.e. install only router with the
best prefer- ence value. It is default behaviour.</p>

<p>-d Send debugging messages to syslog.</p>

<p>-f Run rdisc forever even if no routers are found.
Normally rdisc gives up if it has not received any advertise
message after after soliciting three times, in which case it
exits with a non- zero exit code. If -f is not specified in
the first form then -s must be specified.</p>

<p>-s Send three solicitation messages initially to quickly
discover the routers when the system is booted. When -s is
specified rdisc exits with a non-zero exit code if it can
not find any routers. This can be overridden with the -f
option.</p>

<p>-t Test mode. Do not go to background.</p>

<p>-v Be verbose i.e. send lots of debugging messages to
syslog.</p>

<p>-V Print version and exit.</p>

<p>SECURITY rdisc requires CAP_NET_RAWIO to listen and send
ICMP messages and capa- bility CAP_NET_ADMIN to update
routing tables.</p>

<p>AVAILABILITY rdisc is part of iputils package and the
latest versions are available in source form at
