<p>PAUSE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual PAUSE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME pause - suspend the thread until a signal is
received</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pause(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pause() function shall suspend the
calling thread until delivery of a signal whose action is
either to execute a signal-catching function or to terminate
the process.</p>

<p>If the action is to terminate the process, pause() shall
not return.</p>

<p>If the action is to execute a signal-catching function,
pause() shall return after the signal-catching function
returns.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Since pause() suspends thread execution
indefinitely unless interrupted by a signal, there is no
successful completion return value. A value of -1 shall be
returned and errno set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The pause() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR A signal is caught by the calling process and
control is returned from the signal-catching function.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Many common uses of pause() have
timing windows. The scenario involves checking a condition
related to a signal and, if the signal has not occurred,
calling pause(). When the signal occurs between the check
and the call to pause(), the process often blocks
indefinitely. The sig- procmask() and sigsuspend() functions
can be used to avoid this type of problem.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
