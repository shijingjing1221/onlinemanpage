<p>PAM_END(3) Linux-PAM Manual PAM_END(3)</p>

<p>NAME pam_end - termination of PAM transaction</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int pam_end(pam_handle_t *pamh, int pam_status);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_end function terminates the PAM
transaction and is the last function an application should
call in the PAM context. Upon return the handle pamh is no
longer valid and all memory associated with it will be
invalid.</p>

<p>The pam_status argument should be set to the value
returned to the application by the last PAM library
call.</p>

<p>The value taken by pam_status is used as an argument to
the module specific callback function, cleanup() (See
pam_set_data(3) and pam_get_data(3)). In this way the module
can be given notification of the pass/fail nature of the
tear-down process, and perform any last minute tasks that
are appropriate to the module before it is unlinked. This
argument can be logically OR&acute;d with PAM_DATA_SILENT to
indicate to indicate that the module should not treat the
call too seriously. It is generally used to indicate that
the current closing of the library is in a fork(2)ed
process, and that the parent will take care of cleaning up
things that exist outside of the current process space
(files etc.).</p>

<p>This function free&acute;s all memory for items
associated with the pam_set_item(3) and pam_get_item(3)
functions. Pointers associated with such objects are not
valid anymore after pam_end was called.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS Transaction was successful
terminated.</p>

<p>PAM_SYSTEM_ERR System error, for example a NULL pointer
was submitted as PAM handle or the function was called by a
module.</p>

pam_strerror(3)</p>
