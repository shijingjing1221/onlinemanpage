<p>Name jar-The Java Archive Tool</p>

<p>jar combines multiple files into a single JAR archive
file.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS Create jar file jar c[v0Mmfe] [manifest]
[jarfile] [entrypoint] [-C dir] input- files [-Joption]</p>

<p>Update jar file jar u[v0Mmfe] [manifest] [jarfile]
[entrypoint] [-C dir] input- files [-Joption]</p>

<p>Extract jar file jar x[vf] [jarfile] [inputfiles]
[-Joption]</p>

<p>List table of contents of jar file jar t[vf] [jarfile]
[inputfiles] [-Joption]</p>

<p>Add index to jar file jar i jarfile [-Joption]</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>cuxtiv0Mmfe Options that control the jar command.</p>

<p>jarfile Jar file to be created (c), updated (u),
extracted (x), or have its table of contents viewed (t). The
-f option and filename jarfile are a pair -- if either is
present, they must both appear. Note that omitting f and
jarfile accepts a &quot;jar file&quot; from standard input
(for x and t) or sends the &quot;jar file&quot; to standard
output (for c and u).</p>

<p>inputfiles Files or directories, separated by spaces, to
be combined into jarfile (for c and u), or to be extracted
(for x) or listed (for t) from jarfile. All directories are
processed recursively. The files are compressed unless
option 0 (zero) is used.</p>

<p>manifest Pre-existing manifest file whose name: value
pairs are to be included in MANIFEST.MF in the jar file. The
-m option and file- name manifest are a pair -- if either is
present, they must both appear. The letters m, f and e must
appear in the same order that manifest, jarfile, entrypoint
appear.</p>

<p>entrypoint The name of the class that set as the
application entry point for stand-alone applications bundled
into executable jar file. The -e option and entrypoint are a
pair -- if either is present, they must both appear. The
letters m, f and e must appear in the same order that
manifest, jarfile, entrypoint appear.</p>

<p>-C dir Temporarily changes directories to dir while
processing the fol- lowing inputfiles argument. Multiple -C
dir inputfiles sets are allowed.</p>

<p>-Joption Option to be passed into the Java runtime
environment. (There must be no space between -J and
option).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The jar tool combines multiple files into a
single JAR archive file. jar is a general-purpose archiving
and compression tool, based on ZIP and the ZLIB @
http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ compression format. However, jar
was designed mainly package java applets or applications
into a single archive. When the components of an applet or
application (files, images and sounds) are combined into a
single archive, they can be downloaded by a java agent (like
a browser) in a single HTTP transaction, rather than
requiring a new connection for each piece. This dramatically
improves download times. jar also compresses files and so
further improves down- load time. In addition, it allows
individual entries in a file to be signed by the applet
author so that their origin can be authenticated. The syntax
for the jar tool is almost identical to the syntax for the
tar command. A jar archive can be used as a class path
entry, whether or not it is compressed.</p>

<p>Typical usage to combine files into a jar file is:</p>

<p>% jar cf myFile.jar *.class</p>

<p>In this example, all the class files in the current
directory are placed into the file named myFile.jar. The jar
tool automatically gen- erates a manifest file entry named
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. It is always the first entry in the
jar file. The manifest file declares meta-infor- mation
about the archive, and stores that data as name : value
pairs. Refer to the JAR file specification @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/jar/jar.html#JAR%20Manifest for details
explaining how the jar tool stores meta-information in the
manifest file.</p>

<p>If a jar file should include name : value pairs
contained in an exist- ing manifest file, specify that file
using the -m option:</p>

<p>% jar cmf myManifestFile myFile.jar *.class</p>

<p>An existing manifest file must end with a new line
character. jar does not parse the last line of a manifest
file if it does not end with a new line character.</p>

<p>Note: A jar command that specifies cfm on the command
line instead of cmf (the order of the m and -f options are
reversed), the jar command line must specify the name of the
jar archive first, followed by the name of the manifest
file:</p>

<p>% jar cfm myFile.jar myManifestFile *.class</p>

<p>The manifest is in a text format inspired by RFC822
ASCII format, so it is easy to view and process
manifest-file contents.</p>

<p>To extract the files from a jar file, use x:</p>

<p>% jar xf myFile.jar</p>

<p>To extract individual files from a jar file, supply
their filenames:</p>

<p>% jar xf myFile.jar foo bar</p>

<p>Beginning with version 1.3 of the JDK, the jar utility
supports JarIndex @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/jar/jar.html#JAR_Index, which allows
application class loaders to load classes more efficiently
from jar files. If an applica- tion or applet is bundled
into multiple jar files, only the necessary jar files will
be downloaded and opened to load classes. This perfor- mance
optimization is enabled by running jar with the -ioption. It
will generate package location information for the specified
main jar file and all the jar files it depends on, which
need to be specified in the Class-Path attribute of the main
jar files manifest.</p>

<p>% jar i main.jar</p>

<p>In this example, an INDEX.LIST file is inserted into the
META-INF directory of main.jar. The application class loader
uses the information stored in this file for efficient class
loading. For details about how location informa- tion is
stored in the index file, refer to the JarIndex
specification. To copy directories, first compress files in
dir1 to stdout, then extract from stdin to dir2 (omitting
the -f option from both jar com- mands):</p>

<p>% (cd dir1; jar c .) | (cd dir2; jar x)</p>

<p>To review command samples which use jar to opeate on jar
files and jar file manifests, see Examples, below. Also
refer to the jar trail of the Java Tutorial @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar.</p>

<p>OPTIONS c Creates a new archive file named jarfile (if f
is specified) or to standard output (if f and jarfile are
omitted). Add to it the files and directories specified by
inputfiles.</p>

<p>u Updates an existing file jarfile (when f is specified)
by adding to it files and directories specified by
inputfiles. For example:</p>

<p>jar uf foo.jar foo.class</p>

<p>would add the file foo.class to the existing jar file
foo.jar. The -u option can also update the manifest entry,
as given by this example:</p>

<p>jar umf manifest foo.jar</p>

<p>updates the foo.jar manifest with the name : value pairs
in mani- fest.</p>

<p>x Extracts files and directories from jarfile (if f is
specified) or standard input (if f and jarfile are omitted).
If inputfiles is specified, only those specified files and
directories are extracted. Otherwise, all files and
directories are extracted. The time and date of the
extracted files are those given in the archive.</p>

<p>t Lists the table of contents from jarfile (if f is
specified) or standard input (if f and jarfile are omitted).
If inputfiles is specified, only those specified files and
directories are listed. Otherwise, all files and directories
are listed.</p>

<p>i Generate index information for the specified jarfile
and its dependent jar files. For example:</p>

<p>jar i foo.jar</p>

<p>would generate an INDEX.LIST file in foo.jar which
contains location information for each package in foo.jar
and all the jar files speci- fied in the Class-Path
attribute of foo.jar. See the index example.</p>

<p>f Specifies the file jarfile to be created (c), updated
(u), extracted (x), indexed (i), or viewed (t). The -f
option and filename jarfile are a pair -- if present, they
must both appear. Omitting f and jarfile accepts a jar file
name from stdin(for x and t) or sends jar file to stdout
(for c and u).</p>

<p>v Generates verbose output to standard output. Examples
shown below.</p>

<p>0 (zero) Store without using ZIP compression.</p>

<p>M Do not create a manifest file entry (for c and u), or
delete a manifest file entry if one exists (for u).</p>

<p>m Includes name : value attribute pairs from the
specified manifest file manifest in the file at
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. jar adds a name : value pair unless an
entry already exists with the same name, in which case jar
updates its value. On the command line, the letters m and f
must appear in the same order that manifest and jarfile
appear. Example use:</p>

<p>jar cmf myManifestFile myFile.jar *.class</p>

<p>You can add special-purpose name : value attribute pairs
to the manifest that aren t contained in the default
manifest. For exam- ple, you can add attributes specifying
vendor information, ver- sion information, package sealing,
or to make JAR-bundled appli- cations executable. See the
JAR Files @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/ trail
in the Java Tutorial for examples of using the -m
option.</p>

<p>e Sets entrypoint as the application entry point for
stand-alone applications bundled into executable jar file.
The use of this option creates or overrides the Main-Class
attribute value in the manifest file. This option can be
used during creation of jar file or while updating the jar
file. This option specifies the application entry point
without editing or creating the manifest file. For example,
this command creates Main.jar where the Main-Class attribute
value in the manifest is set to Main:</p>

<p>jar cfe Main.jar Main Main.class</p>

<p>The java runtime can directly invoke this application by
running the following command:</p>

<p>java -jar Main.jar</p>

<p>If the entrypoint class name is in a package it may use
either a dot (&quot;.&quot;) or slash (&quot;/&quot;)
character as the delimiter. For example, if Main.class is in
a package called foo the entry point can be specified in the
following ways:</p>

<p>jar -cfe Main.jar foo/Main foo/Main.class</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>jar -cfe Main.jar foo.Main foo/Main.class</p>

<p>Note: specifying both -m and -e options together when
the given manifest also contains the Main-Class attribute
results in an ambigous Main.class specification, leading to
an error and the jar creation or update operation is
aborted.</p>

<p>-C dir Temporarily changes directories (cd dir) during
execution of the jar command while processing the following
inputfiles argument. Its operation is intended to be similar
to the -C option of the UNIX tar utility. For example, this
command changes to the classes directory and adds the
bar.class from that directory to foo.jar:</p>

<p>jar uf foo.jar -C classes bar.class</p>

<p>This command changes to the classes directory and adds
to foo.jar all files within the classes directory (without
creating a classes directory in the jar file), then changes
back to the original directory before changing to the bin
directory to add xyz.class to foo.jar.</p>

<p>jar uf foo.jar -C classes . -C bin xyz.class</p>

<p>If classes holds files bar1 and bar2, then here s what
the jar file will contain using jar tf foo.jar:</p>

<p>META-INF/ META-INF/MANIFEST.MF bar1 bar2 xyz.class</p>

<p>-Joption Pass option to the Java runtime environment,
where option is one of the options described on the
reference page for the java application launcher. For
example, -J-Xmx48M sets the maximum memory to 48 megabytes.
It is a common convention for -J to pass options to the
underlying runtime environment.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT FILES To shorten or simplify the
jar command line, you can specify one or more files that
themselves contain arguments to the jar command (except -J
options). This enables you to create jar commands of any
length, overcoming command line limits imposed by the
operating system.</p>

<p>An argument file can include options and filenames. The
arguments within a file can be space-separated or
newline-separated. Filenames within an argument file are
relative to the current directory, not rel- ative to the
location of the argument file. Wildcards (*) that might
otherwise be expanded by the operating system shell are not
expanded. Use of the @ character to recursively interpret
files is not supported. The -J options are not supported
because they are passed to the launcher, which does not
support argument files.</p>

<p>When executing jar, pass in the path and name of each
argument file with the @ leading character. When jar
encounters an argument beginning with the character @, it
expands the contents of that file into the argument list.
The example below, classes.list holds the names of files
output by a find command:</p>

<p>% find . -name *.class -print &gt; classes.list</p>

<p>You can then execute the jar command on Classes.list by
passing it to jar using argfile syntax:</p>

<p>% jar cf my.jar @classes.list</p>

<p>An argument file can specify a path, but any filenames
inside the argu- ment file that have relative paths are
relative to the current working directory, not to the path
passed in. Here is an example:</p>

<p>% jar @path1/classes.list</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To add all the files in a particular directory
to an archive (overwrit- ing contents if the archive already
exists). Enumerating verbosely (with the -v option) will
tell you more information about the files in the archive,
such as their size and last modified date.</p>

<p>% ls 1.au Animator.class monkey.jpg 2.au Wave.class
spacemusic.au 3.au at_work.gif</p>

<p>% jar cvf bundle.jar * added manifest adding: 1.au(in =
2324) (out= 67)(deflated 97%) adding: 2.au(in = 6970) (out=
90)(deflated 98%) adding: 3.au(in = 11616) (out=
108)(deflated 99%) adding: Animator.class(in = 2266) (out=
66)(deflated 97%) adding: Wave.class(in = 3778) (out=
81)(deflated 97%) adding: at_work.gif(in = 6621) (out=
89)(deflated 98%) adding: monkey.jpg(in = 7667) (out=
91)(deflated 98%) adding: spacemusic.au(in = 3079) (out=
73)(deflated 97%)</p>

<p>If you already have separate subdirectories for images,
audio files and classes, you can combine them into a single
jar file:</p>

<p>% ls -F audio/ classes/ images/</p>

<p>% jar cvf bundle.jar audio classes images added manifest
adding: audio/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) adding:
audio/1.au(in = 2324) (out= 67)(deflated 97%) adding:
audio/2.au(in = 6970) (out= 90)(deflated 98%) adding:
audio/3.au(in = 11616) (out= 108)(deflated 99%) adding:
audio/spacemusic.au(in = 3079) (out= 73)(deflated 97%)
adding: classes/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) adding:
classes/Animator.class(in = 2266) (out= 66)(deflated 97%)
adding: classes/Wave.class(in = 3778) (out= 81)(deflated
97%) adding: images/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%) adding:
images/monkey.jpg(in = 7667) (out= 91)(deflated 98%) adding:
images/at_work.gif(in = 6621) (out= 89)(deflated 98%)</p>

<p>% ls -F audio/ bundle.jar classes/ images/</p>

<p>To see the entry names in the jarfile, use the t
option:</p>

<p>% jar tf bundle.jar META-INF/ META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
audio/1.au audio/2.au audio/3.au audio/spacemusic.au
classes/Animator.class classes/Wave.class images/monkey.jpg
images/at_work.gif</p>

<p>To add an index file to the jar file for speeding up
class loading, use the i option. Example:</p>

<p>If you split the inter-dependent classes for a stock
trade application into three jar files: main.jar, buy.jar,
and sell.jar.</p>

<p>If you specify the Class-path attribute in the main.jar
manifest as:</p>

<p>Class-Path: buy.jar sell.jar</p>

<p>then you can use the -i option to speed up the class
loading time for your application:</p>

<p>% jar i main.jar</p>

<p>An INDEX.LIST file is inserted to the META-INF
directory. This enables the application class loader to
download the specified jar files when it is searching for
classes or resources.</p>
