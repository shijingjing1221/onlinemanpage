<p>sane(7) SANE Scanner Access Now Easy sane(7)</p>

<p>NAME sane - Scanner Access Now Easy: API for accessing
scanners</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SANE is an application programming interface
(API) that provides stan- dardized access to any raster
image scanner hardware. The standardized interface makes it
possible to write just one driver for each scanner device
instead of one driver for each scanner and application.</p>

<p>While SANE is primarily targeted at a UNIX environment,
the standard has been carefully designed to make it possible
to implement the API on virtually any hardware or operating
system.</p>

<p>This manual page provides a summary of the information
available about SANE.</p>

<p>If you have trouble getting your scanner detected, read
the PROBLEMS section.</p>

<p>TERMINOLOGY An application that uses the SANE interface
is called a SANE frontend. A driver that implements the SANE
interface is called a SANE backend. A meta backend provides
some means to manage one or more other back- ends.</p>

<p>SOFTWARE PACKAGES The package sane-backends contains a
lot of backends, documentation (including the SANE
standard), networking support, and the command line frontend
scanimage. The frontends xscanimage , xcam, and scanadf are
included in the package sane-frontends. Both packages can be
downloaded from the SANE homepage
(http://www.sane-project.org/). Information about other
frontends and backends can also be found on the SANE
homepage.</p>

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION The following sections provide short
descriptions and links to more information about several
aspects of SANE. A name with a number in parenthesis (e.g.
sane-dll(5)) points to a manual page. In this case man 5
sane-dll will display the page. Entries like
/usr/share/doc/sane-backends-1.0.21/sane.tex are references
to text files that were copied to the SANE documentation
directory (/usr/share/doc/sane-backends-1.0.21/) during
installation. Everything else is a URL to a resource on the
web.</p>

<p>SANE homepage Information on all aspects of SANE
including a tutorial and a link to the SANE FAQ can be found
on the SANE homepage: http://www.sane-project.org/.</p>

<p>SANE device lists The SANE device lists contain
information about the status of SANE support for a specific
device. If your scanner is not listed there (either
supported or unsupported), please contact us. See section
HOW CAN YOU HELP SANE for details. There are lists for
specific releases of SANE, for the current development
version and a search engine:
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html. The
lists are also installed on your system at
/usr/share/doc/sane-back- ends-1.0.21/.</p>

<p>SANE mailing list There is a mailing list for the
purpose of discussing the SANE stan- dard and its
implementations: sane-devel. Despite its name, the list is
not only intended for developers, but also for users. There
are also some more lists for special topics, however, for
users, sane-devel is the right list. How to subscribe and
unsubscribe:
http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html.</p>

<p>SANE IRC channel The IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel
#sane can be found on the Freenode network
(irc.freenode.net). It s for discussing SANE prob- lems,
talking about development and general SANE related chatting.
Before asking for help, please read the other documentation
mentioned in this manual page. The channels topic is also
used for announce- ments of problems with SANE
infrastructure (mailing lists, web server, etc.).</p>

the list of projects in
/usr/share/doc/sane-backends-1.0.21/PROJECTS.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS BACKENDS dll The sane-dll library
implements a SANE backend that provides access to an
arbitrary number of other SANE backends by dynamic loading.
See sane-dll(5).</p>

<p>net The SANE network daemon saned provides access to
scanners located on different computers in connection with
the net backend. See sane-net(5) and saned(8).</p>

<p>pnm PNM image reader pseudo-backend. The purpose of this
backend is pri- marily to aid in debugging of SANE
frontends. See sane-pnm(5).</p>

<p>pint Backend for scanners that use the PINT (Pint Is Not
Twain) device driver. The PINT driver is being actively
developed on the OpenBSD platform, and has been ported to a
few other *nix-like operating sys- tems. See
sane-pint(5).</p>

<p>test The SANE test backend is for testing frontends and
the SANE installa- tion. It provides test pictures and
various test options. See sane-test(5).</p>

<p>v4l The sane-v4l library implements a SANE backend that
provides generic access to video cameras and similar
equipment using the V4L (Video for Linux) API. See
sane-v4l(5).</p>

<p>Also, have a look at the backend information page at
http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html and
the list of projects in
/usr/share/doc/sane-backends-1.0.21/PROJECTS.</p>

<p>CHANGING THE TOP-LEVEL BACKEND By default, all SANE
backends (drivers) are loaded dynamically by the sane-dll
meta backend. If you have any questions about the dynamic
loading, read sane-dll(5). SANE frontend can also be linked
to other backends directly by copying or linking a backend
to libsane.so in /usr/lib64/sane.</p>

<p>DEVELOPES DOCUMENTATION It s not hard to write a SANE
backend. It can take some time, however. You should have
basic knowledge of C and enough patience to work through the
documentation and find out how your scanner works. Appended
is a list of some documents that help to write backends and
frontends.</p>

<p>The SANE standard defines the application programming
interface (API) that is used to communicate between
frontends and backends. It can be found at
/usr/share/doc/sane-backends-1.0.21/sane.ps (if latex is
installed on your system) and on the SANE website:
http://www.sane-project.org/html/ (HTML), or
http://www.sane-project.org/sane.ps (Postscript).</p>

<p>There is some more information for programmers in
/usr/share/doc/sane- backends-1.0.21/backend-writing.txt.
Most of the internal SANE rou- tines (sanei) are documented
using doxygen: http://www.sane-project.org/sanei/. Before a
new backend or frontend project is started, have a look at
/usr/share/doc/sane-back- ends-1.0.21/PROJECTS for projects
that are planned or not yet included into the SANE
distribution and at our bug-tracking system:
http://www.http://www.sane-project.org/bugs.html.</p>

<p>There are some links on how to find out about the
protocol of a scan- ner:
http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/misc/develop.html.</p>

<p>If you start writing a backend or frontend or any other
part of SANE, please contact the sane-devel mailing list for
coordination so the same work isnt done twice.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/sane.d/*.conf The backend configuration
files.</p>

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-*.a The static libraries

<p>/usr/lib64/sane/libsane-*.so The shared libraries

documentation: The standard, READMEs, text files for back-
ends etc.</p>

<p>PROBLEMS If your device isn t found but you know that it
is supported, make sure that it is detected by your
operating system. For SCSI and USB scan- ners, use the
sane-find-scanner tool (see sane-find-scanner(1) for
details). It prints one line for each scanner it has
detected and some comments (#). If sane-find-scanner finds
your scanner only as root but not as normal user, the
permissions for the device files are not adjusted correctly.
If the scanner isn t found at all, the operating system
hasnt detected it and may need some help. Depending on the
type of your scanner, read sane-usb(5) or sane-scsi(5). If
your scanner (or other device) is not connected over the
SCSI bus or USB, read the back- ends manual page for details
on how to set it up.</p>

<p>Now your scanner is detected by the operating system but
not by SANE? Try scanimage -L. If the scanner is not found,
check that the back- ends name is mentioned in
/etc/sane.d/dll.conf. Some backends are commented out by
default. Remove the comment sign for your backend in this
case. Also some backends arent compiled at all if one of
their prerequisites are missing. Examples include dc210,
dc240, canon_pp, hpsj5s, gphoto2, pint, qcam, v4l, net,
sm3600, snapscan, pnm. If you need one of these backends and
they arent available, read the build instructions in the
README file and the individual manual pages of the
backends.</p>

<p>Another reason for not being detected by scanimage -L
may be a missing or wrong configuration in the backends
configuration file. While SANE tries to automatically find
most scanners, some cant be setup cor- rectly without the
intervention of the administrator. Also on some operating
systems auto-detection may not work. Check the backends man-
ual page for details.</p>

<p>If your scanner is still not found, try setting the
various environment variables that are available to assist
in debugging. The environment variables are documented in
the relevant manual pages. For example, to get the maximum
amount of debug information when testing a Mustek SCSI
scanner, set environment variables SANE_DEBUG_DLL,
SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK, and SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI to 128 and then
invoke scanimage -L . The debug messages for the dll backend
tell if the mustek backend was found and loaded at all. The
mustek messages explain what the mustek backend is doing
while the SCSI debugging shows the low level handling. If
you can t find out what s going on by checking the messages
carefully, con- tact the sane-devel mailing list for help
(see REPORTING BUGS below).</p>

<p>Now that your scanner is found by scanimage -L, try to
do a scan: scan- image &gt;image.pnm. This command starts a
scan for the default scanner with default settings. All the
available options are listed by running scanimage --help. If
scanning aborts with an error message, turn on debugging as
mentioned above. Maybe the configuration file needs some
tuning, e.g. to setup the path to a firmware that is needed
by some scanners. See the backends manual page for details.
If you cant find out whats wrong, contact sane-devel.</p>

<p>To check that the SANE libraries are installed correctly
you can use the test backend, even if you dont have a
scanner or other SANE device:</p>

<p>scanimage -d test -T</p>

<p>You should get a list of PASSed tests. You can do the
same with your backend by changing &quot;test&quot; to your
backends name.</p>

<p>So now scanning with scanimage works and you want to use
one of the graphical frontends like xsane, xscanimage, or
quiteinsane but those frontends don t detect your scanner?
One reason may be that you installed two versions of SANE.
E.g. the version that was installed by your distribution in
/usr and one you installed from source in /usr/local/. Make
sure that only one version is installed. Another possible
reason is, that your systems dynamic loader cant find the
SANE libraries. For Linux, make sure that /etc/ld.so.conf
contains /usr/local/lib and does not contain
/usr/local/lib/sane. See also the documentation of the
frontends.</p>
