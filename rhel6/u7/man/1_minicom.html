<p>MINICOM(1) Version 2.1 MINICOM(1)</p>

<p>NAME minicom - friendly serial communication program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS minicom [-somMlwz8] [-c on|off] [-S script] [-d
entry] [-a on|off] [-t term] [-p pty] [-C capturefile]
[configuration]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION minicom is a communication program which
somewhat resembles the share- ware program TELIX but is free
with source code and runs under most unices. Features
include dialing directory with auto-redial, support for
UUCP-style lock files on serial devices, a separate script
language interpreter, capture to file, multiple users with
individual configura- tions, and more.</p>

<p>COMMAND-LINE -s Setup. Root edits the system-wide
defaults in /etc/minirc.dfl with this option. When it is
used, minicom does not initialize, but puts you directly
into the configuration menu. This is very handy if minicom
refuses to start up because your system has changed, or for
the first time you run minicom. For most systems, reasonable
defaults are already compiled in.</p>

<p>-o Do not initialize. Minicom will skip the
initialization code. This option is handy if you quitted
from minicom without reset- ting, and then want to restart a
session. It is potentially dan- gerous though: no check for
lock files etc. is made, so a normal user could interfere
with things like uucp... Maybe this will be taken out later.
For now it is assumed, that users who are given access to a
modem are responsible enough for their actions.</p>

<p>-m Override command-key with the Meta or ALT key. This
is the default in 1.80 and it can also be configured in one
of minicoms menus, but if you use different terminals all
the time, of which some don t have a Meta or ALT key, its
handy to set the default com- mand key to Ctrl-A and use
this option when you have a keyboard supporting Meta or ALT
keys. Minicom assumes that your Meta key sends the ESC
prefix, not the other variant that sets the highest bit of
the character.</p>

<p>-M Same as -m, but assumes that your Meta key sets the
8th bit of the character high (sends 128 + character
code).</p>

<p>-z Use terminal status line. This only works on
terminals that sup- port it and that have the relevant
information in their termcap or terminfo database entry.</p>

<p>-l Literal translation of characters with the high bit
set. With this flag on, minicom will try to translate the
IBM line characters to ASCII. Many PC-unix clones will
display character correctly with- out translation (Linux in
a special mode, Coherent and Sco).</p>

<p>-L Ditto but assume screen uses an ISO8859 character
set.</p>

<p>-w Turns line-wrap on at startup by default.</p>

<p>-a Attribute usage. Some terminals, notably Televideos,
have rotten attribute handling (serial instead of parallel).
By default, mini- com uses -a on , but if you are using such
a terminal you can (must!) supply the option -a off. The
trailing on or off is needed.</p>

<p>-t Terminal type. With this flag, you can override the
environment TERM variable. This is handy for use in the
MINICOM environment variable; one can create a special
termcap entry for use with minicom on the console, that
initializes the screen to raw mode so that in conjunction
with the -l flag, the IBM line characters are displayed
untranslated.</p>

<p>-c Color usage. Some terminals (such as the Linux
console) support color with the standard ANSI escape
sequences. Because there is apparently no termcap support
for color, these escape sequences are hard-coded into
minicom. Therefore this option is off by default. You can
turn it on with -c on. This, and the -m option, are good
candidates to put into the MINICOM environment variable.</p>

<p>-S script. Run the named script at startup. So far,
passing username and password to a startup script is not
supported. If you also use the -d option to start dialing at
startup, the -S script will be run BEFORE dialing the
entries specified with -d.</p>

<p>-d Dial an entry from the dialing directory on startup.
You can spec- ify an index number, but also a substring of
the name of the entry. If you specify a name that has
multiple entries in the directory, they are all tagged for
dialing. You can also specify multiple names or index
numbers by separating them with commas. The dialing will
start from the first entry specified after all other program
initialization procedures are completed.</p>

<p>-p Pseudo terminal to use. This overrides the terminal
port defined in the configuration files, but only if it is a
pseudo tty. The filename supplied must be of the form
(/dev/)tty[p-z/][0-f], (/dev/)pts[p-z/][0-f] or
(/dev/)pty[p-z/][0-f]. For example, /dev/ttyp1, pts/0 or
/dev/ptyp2.</p>

<p>-C filename. Open capture file at startup.</p>

<p>-T Disable the display of the online time in the status
bar.</p>

<p>-7 7bit mode for terminals which arent 8bit capable.
8bit is default if the environment is configured for this
via LANG or LC_ALL, 7bit otherwise.</p>

<p>-8 8bit characters pass through without any
modification. Continu- ous means no locate/attribute control
sequences are inserted without real change of
locate/attribute. This mode is to display 8bit multi-byte
characters such as Japanese. Not needed in every language
with 8bit characters. (For example displaying Finnish text
doesnt need this.)</p>

<p>When minicom starts, it first searches the MINICOM
environment variable for command-line arguments, which can
be over-ridden on the command line. Thus, if you have
done</p>

<p>MINICOM=&rsquo;-m -c on&rsquo; export MINICOM</p>

<p>or the equivalent, and start minicom, minicom will
assume that your terminal has a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key and
that color is supported. If you then log in from a terminal
without color support, and you have set MINICOM in your
startup (.profile or equivalent) file, and dont want to
re-set your environment variable, you can type minicom -c
off and run without color support for that session.</p>

<p>configuration The configuration argument is more
interesting. Normally, minicom gets its defaults from a file
called &quot;minirc.dfl&quot;. If you however give an
argument to minicom, it will try to get its defaults from a
file called &quot;minirc.configuration&quot;. So it is
possible to create multiple configuration files, for
different ports, different users etc. Most sensible is to
use device names, such as tty1, tty64, sio2 etc. If a user
creates his own configuration file, it will show up in his
home directory as .minirc.dfl.</p>

<p>USE Minicom is window based. To popup a window with the
function you want, press Control-A (from now on, we will use
C-A to mean Control-A), and then the function key (a-z or
A-Z). By pressing C-A first and then z, a help screen comes
up with a short summary of all commands. This escape key can
be altered when minicom is configured (-s option or C-A O),
but well stick to Control-A for now.</p>

<p>For every menu the next keys can be used: UP arrow-up or
k DOWN arrow-down or j LEFT arrow-left or h RIGHT
arrow-right or l CHOOSE Enter CANCEL ESCape.</p>

<p>The screen is divided into two portions: the upper 24
lines are the terminal-emulator screen. In this window, ANSI
or VT100 escape sequences are interpreted. If there is a
line left at the bottom, a status line is placed there. If
this is not possible the status line will be showed every
time you press C-A. On terminals that have a spe- cial
status line that will be used if the termcap information is
com- plete and the -k flag has been given.</p>

<p>Possible commands are listed next, in alphabetical
order. C-A Pressing C-A a second time will just send a C-A
to the remote sys- tem. If you have changed your
&quot;escape character&quot; to something other than C-A,
this works analogously for that character. A Toggle Add
Linefeed on/off. If it is on, a linefeed is added before
every carriage return displayed on the screen. B Gives you a
scroll back buffer. You can scroll up with u, down with d, a
page up with b, a page down with f, and if you have them the
arrow and page up/page down keys can also be used. You can
search for text in the buffer with s (case-sensitive) or S
(case- insensitive). N will find the next occurrence of the
string. c will enter citation mode. A text cursor appears
and you specify the start line by hitting Enter key. Then
scroll back mode will finish and the contents with prefix
&gt; will be sent. C Clears the screen. D Dial a number, or
go to the dialing directory. E Toggle local echo on and off
(if your version of minicom supports it). F A break signal
is sent to the modem. G Run script (Go). Runs a login
script. H Hangup. I Toggle the type of escape sequence that
the cursor keys send between normal and applications mode.
(See also the comment about the status line below). J Jump
to a shell. On return, the whole screen will be redrawn. K
Clears the screen, runs kermit and redraws the screen upon
return. L Turn Capture file on off. If turned on, all output
sent to the screen will be captured in the file too. M Sends
the modem initialization string. If you are online and the
DCD line setting is on, you are asked for confirmation
before the modem is initialized. O Configure minicom. Puts
you in the configuration menu. P Communication Parameters.
Allows you to change the bps rate, par- ity and number of
bits. Q Exit minicom without resetting the modem. If macros
changed and were not saved, you will have a chance to do so.
R Receive files. Choose from various protocols (external).
If you have the filename selection window and the prompt for
download directory enabled, youll get a selection window for
choosing the directory for downloading. Otherwise the
download directory defined in the Filenames and paths menu
will be used. S Send files. Choose the protocol like you do
with the receive com- mand. If you dont have the filename
selection window enabled (in the File transfer protocols
menu), youll just have to write the filename(s) in a dialog
window. If you have the selection window enabled, a window
will pop up showing the filenames in your upload directory.
You can tag and untag filenames by pressing spacebar, and
move the cursor up and down with the cursor keys or j/k. The
selected filenames are shown highlighted. Directory names
are shown [within brackets] and you can move up or down in
the direc- tory tree by pressing the spacebar twice.
Finally, send the files by pressing ENTER or quit by
pressing ESC. T Choose Terminal emulation: Ansi(color) or
vt100. You can also change the backspace key here, turn the
status line on or off, and define delay (in milliseconds)
after each newline if you need that. W Toggle line-wrap
on/off. X Exit minicom, reset modem. If macros changed and
were not saved, you will have a chance to do so. Y Paste a
file. Reads a file and sends its contests just as if it
would be typed in. Z Pop up the help screen.</p>

<p>DIALING DIRECTORY By pressing C-A D the program puts you
in the dialing directory. Select a command by pressing the
capitalized letter or moving cursor right/left with the
arrow keys or the h/l keys and pressing Enter. You can add,
delete or edit entries and move them up and down in the
direc- tory list. By choosing &quot;dial&quot; the phone
numbers of the tagged entries, or if nothing is tagged, the
number of the highlighted entry will be dialed. While the
modem is dialing, you can press escape to cancel dialing.
Any other key will close the dial window, but won t cancel
the dialing itself. Your dialing directory will be saved
into the file &quot;.dialdir&quot; in your home directory.
You can scroll up and down with the arrow keys, but you can
also scroll complete pages by pressing the PageUp or
PageDown key. If you dont have those, use Control-B (Back-
ward) and Control-F (Forward). You can use the space bar to
tag a num- ber of entries and minicom will rotate trough
this list if a connection cant be made. A &gt; symbol is
drawn in the directory before the names of the tagged
entries.</p>

<p>The &quot;edit&quot; menu speaks for itself, but I will
discuss it briefly here. A - Name The name for this entry B
- Number and its telephone number. C - Dial string # Which
specific dial string you want to use to connect. There are
three different dial strings (prefixes and suffixes) that
can be configured in the Modem and dialing menu. D - Local
echo can be on or off for this system (if your version of
minicom supports it). E - Script The script that must be
executed after a successful connec- tion is made (see the
manual for runscript) F - Username The username that is
passed to the runscript program. It is passed in the
environment string &quot;$LOGIN&quot;. G - Password The
password is passed as &quot;$PASS&quot;. H - Terminal
Emulation Use ANSI or VT100 emulation. I - Backspace key
sends What code (Backspace or Delete) the backspace key
sends. J - Linewrap Can be on or off. K - Line settings Bps
rate, bits, parity and number of stop bits to use for this
connection. You can choose current for the speed, so that it
will use whatever speed is being used at that moment (useful
if you have multiple modems). L - Conversion table You may
specify a character conversion table to be loaded whenever
this entry answers, before running the login script. If this
field is blank, the conversion table stays unchanged. The
edit menu also shows the latest date and time when you
called this entry and the total number of calls there, but
doesn t let you change them. They are updated automatically
when you connect.</p>

<p>The moVe command lets you move the highlighted entry up
or down in the dialing directory with the up/down arrow keys
or the k and j keys. Press Enter or ESC to end moving the
entry.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION By pressing C-A O you will be thrown into
the setup menu.</p>

<p>Filenames and paths This menu defines your default
directories. A - Download directory where the downloaded
files go to. B - Upload directory where the uploaded files
are read from. C - Script directory Where you keep your
login scripts. D - Script program Which program to use as
the script interpreter. Defaults to the program
&quot;runscript&quot;, but if you want to use something else
(eg, /bin/sh or &quot;expect&quot;) it is possible. Stdin
and stdout are con- nected to the modem, stderr to the
screen. If the path is relative (ie, does not start with a
slash) then its relative to your home directory, except for
the script interpreter. E - Kermit program Where to find the
executable for kermit, and its options. Some simple macros
can be used on the command line: %l is expanded to the
complete filename of the dial out-device, %f is expanded to
the serial port file descriptor and %b is expanded to the
current serial port speed. F - Logging options Options to
configure the logfile writing.</p>

<p>A - File name Here you can enter the name of the
logfile. The file will be written in your home directory,
and the default value is &quot;minicom.log&quot;. If you
blank the name, all logging is turned off.</p>

<p>B - Log connects and hangups This option defines whether
or not the logfile is written when the remote end answers
the call or hangs up. Or when you give the hangup command
yourself or leave minicom without hangup while online.</p>

<p>C - Log file transfers Do you want log entries of
receiving and sending files. The log command in the scripts
is not affected by logging options B and C. It is always
executed, if you just have the name of the log file
defined.</p>

<p>File Transfer Protocols Protocols defined here will show
up when C-A s/r is pressed. &quot;Name&quot; in the
beginning of the line is the name that will show up in the
menu. &quot;Program&quot; is the path to the protocol.
&quot;Name&quot; after that defines if the program needs an
argument, e.g. a file to be trans- mitted. U/D defines if
this entry should show up in the upload or the download
menu. Fullscr defines if the program should run full screen,
or that minicom will only show its stderr in a window. IO-
Red defines if minicom should attach the programs standard
in and output to the modem port or not. &quot;Multi&quot;
tells the filename selec- tion window whether or not the
protocol can send multiple files with one command. It has no
effect on download protocols, and it is also ignored with
upload protocols if you dont use the filename selec- tion
window. The old sz and rz are not full screen, and have
IO-Red set. However, there are curses based versions of at
least rz that do not want their stdin and stdout redirected,
and run full screen. All file transfer protocols are run
with the UID of the user, and not with UID=root. %l, %f and
%b can be used on the command line as with kermit. Within
this menu you can also define if you want to use the
filename selection window when prompted for files to upload,
and if you like to be prompted for the download directory
every time the automatic download is started. If you leave
the down- load directory prompt disabled, the download
directory defined in the file and directory menu is
used.</p>

<p>Serial port setup A - Serial device /dev/tty1 or
/dev/ttyS1 for most people. /dev/cua&lt;n&gt; is still
possible under linux, but not recommended any more because
these devices are obsolete and many newly installed systems
with kernel 2.2.x or newer dont have them. Use
/dev/ttyS&lt;n&gt; instead. You may also have /dev/modem as
a symlink to the real device. If you have modems connected
to two or more serial ports, you may specify all of them
here in a list separated by space, comma or semicolon. When
Minicom starts, it checks the list until it finds an
available modem and uses that one. (However, you can t
specify different init strings to them ..at least not yet.)
To use a UNIX socket for communication the device name must
be prefixed with &quot;unix#&quot; following by the full
path and the file- name of the socket. Minicom will then try
to connect to this socket as a client. As long as it cannot
connect to the socket it stays offline. As soon as the
connection establishes, minicom goes online . If the server
closes the socket, minicom switches to offline again. B -
Lock file location On most systems This should be
/usr/spool/uucp. Linux systems use /var/lock. If this
directory does not exist, minicom will not attempt to use
lockfiles. C - Callin program If you have a uugetty or
something on your serial port, it could be that you want a
program to be run to switch the modem cq. port into
dialin/dialout mode. This is the program to get into dialin
mode. D - Callout program And this to get into dialout mode.
E - Bps/Par/Bits Default parameters at startup.</p>

<p>If one of the entries is left blank, it will not be
used. So if you dont care about locking, and don t have a
getty running on your modemline, entries B - D should be
left blank.</p>

<p>Modem and Dialing Here, the parameters for your modem
are defined. I will not explain this further because the
defaults are for generic Hayes modems, and should work
always. This file is not a Hayes tutorial :-) The only
things worth noticing are that control characters can be
sent by prefixing them with a ^, in which ^^ means ^ itself,
and the character must also be doubled as \ , because
backslash is used specially in the macro definitions. Some
options however, dont have much to do with the modem but
more with the behaviour of minicom itself: M - Dial time The
number of seconds before minicom times out if no connection
is established. N - Delay before redial Minicom will redial
if no connection was made, but it first waits some time. O -
Number of tries Maximum number of times that minicom
attempts to dial. P - Drop DTR time If you set this to 0,
minicom hangs up by sending a Hayes-type hangup sequence. If
you specify a non-zero value, the hangup will be done by
dropping the DTR line. The value tells in sec- onds how long
DTR will be kept down. Q - Auto bps detect If this is on,
minicom tries to match the dialed partys speed. With most
modern modems this is NOT desirable, since the modem buffers
the data and converts the speed. R - Modem has DCD line If
your modem, and your O/S both support the DCD line (that
goes high when a connection is made) minicom will use it.
When you have this option on, minicom will also NOT start
dial- ing while you are already online. S - Status line
shows DTE speed / line speed You can toggle the status line
to show either the DTE speed (the speed which minicom uses
to communicate with your modem) or the line speed (the speed
that your modem uses on the line to communicate with the
other modem). Notice that the line speed may change during
the connection, but you will still only see the initial
speed that the modems started the connection with. This is
because the modem doesn t tell the program if the speed is
changed. Also, to see the line speed, you need to have the
modem set to show it in the connect string. Otherwise you
will only see 0 as the line speed. T - Multi-line untag You
can toggle the feature to untag entries from the dialing
directory when a connection is established to a multi-line
BBS. All the tagged entries that have the same name are
untagged.</p>

<p>Note that a special exception is made for this menu:
every user can change all parameters here, but some of them
will not be saved.</p>

<p>Screen and keyboard A - Command key is the Hot Key that
brings you into command mode. If this is set to ALT or meta
key, you can directly call commands by alt- key instead of
HotKey-key. B - Backspace key sends There still are some
systems that want a VT100 to send DEL instead of BS. With
this option you can enable that stupidity. (Eh, its even on
by default...) C - Status line is Enabled or disabled. Some
slow terminals (for example, X-termi- nals) cause the status
line to jump &quot;up and down&quot; when scrolling, so you
can turn it off if desired. It will still be shown in
command-mode. D - Alarm sound If turned on, minicom will
sound an alarm (on the console only) after a successful
connection and when up/downloading is com- plete. E -
Foreground Color (menu) indicates the foreground color to
use for all the configuration windows in minicom. F -
Background Color (menu) indicates the background color to
use for all the configuration windows in minicom. Note that
minicom will not allow you to set foreground and background
colors to the same value. G - Foreground Color (term)
indicates the foreground color to use in the terminal
window. H - Background Color (term) indicates the background
color to use in the terminal window. Note that minicom will
not allow you to set foreground and background colors to the
same value. I - Foreground Color (stat) indicates the
foreground color to use in for the status bar. J -
Background Color (stat) indicates the color to use in for
the status bar. Note that minicom will allow you to set the
status bar s foreground and background colors to the same
value. This will effectively make the status bar invisible
but if these are your intentions, please see the option K -
History buffer size The number of lines to keep in the
history buffer (for backscrolling). L - Macros file is the
full path to the file that holds macros. Macros allow you to
define a string to be sent when you press a certain key. In
minicom, you may define F1 through F10 to send up to 256
characters [this is set at compile time]. The filename you
specify is verified as soon as you hit ENTER. If you do not
have permissions to create the specified file, an error
message will so indicate and you will be forced to re-edit
the file- name. If you are permitted to create the file,
minicom checks to see if it already exists. If so, it
assumes its a macro file and reads it in. If it isnt, well,
its your problem :-) If the file does not exist, the
filename is accepted. M - Edit Macros opens up a new window
which allows you to edit the F1 through F10 macros. N -
Macros enabled - Yes or No. If macros are disabled, the
F1-F10 keys will just send the VT100/VT220 function key
escape sequences. O - Character conversion The active
conversion table filename is shown here. If you can see no
name, no conversion is active. Pressing O, you will see the
conversion table edit menu.</p>

<p>Edit Macros Here, the macros for F1 through F10 are
defined. The bottom of the window shows a legend of
character combinations that have special meaning. They allow
you to enter special con- trol characters with plain text by
prefixing them with a ^, in which ^^ means ^ itself. You can
send a 1 second delay with the ^~ code. This is useful when
you are trying to login after ftping or telneting somewhere.
You can also include your current username and password from
the phone directory in the macros with and , respectively.
If you need the backslash character in the macro, write it
dou- bled as \. To edit a macro, press the number (or letter
for F10) and you will be moved to the end of the macro. When
editing the line, you may use the left &amp; right arrows,
Home &amp; End keys, Delete &amp; BackSpace, and ESC and
RETURN. ESC can- cels any changes made while ENTER accepts
the changes.</p>

<p>Character conversion Here you can edit the character
conversion table. If you are not an American, you know that
in many languages there are characters that are not included
in the ASCII character set, and in the old times they may
have replaced some less impor- tant characters in ASCII and
now they are often represented with character codes above
127. AND there are various differ- ent ways to represent
them. This is where you may edit con- version tables for
systems that use a character set different from the one on
your computer.</p>

<p>A - Load table You probably guessed it. This command
loads a table from the disk. You are asked a file name for
the table. Pre- defined tables .mciso, .mcpc8 and .mcsf7
should be included with the program. Table .mciso does no
conver- sion, .mcpc8 is to be used for connections with
systems that use the 8-bit pc character set, and .mcsf7 is
for compatibility with the systems that uses the good old
7-bit coding to replace the characters {|}[] with the
diacritical characters used in Finnish and Swedish.</p>

<p>B - Save table This one saves the active table on the
filename you spec- ify.</p>

<p>C - edit char This is where you can make your own
modifications to the existing table. First you are asked the
character value (in decimal) whose conversion you want to
change. Next youll say which character you want to see on
your screen when that character comes from the outside
world. And then youll be asked what you want to be sent out
when you enter that character from your keyboard.</p>

<p>D - next screen</p>

<p>E - prev screen Yeah, you probably noticed that this
screen shows you what kind of conversions are active. The
screen just is (usu- ally) too small to show the whole table
at once in an easy-to-understand format. This is how you can
scroll the table left and right.</p>

<p>F - convert capture Toggles whether or not the character
conversion table is used when writing the capture file.</p>

<p>Save setup as dfl Save the parameters as the default for
the next time the program is started. Instead of dfl, any
other parameter name may appear, depending on which one was
used when the program was started.</p>

<p>Save setup as.. Save the parameters under a special
name. Whenever Minicom is started with this name as an
argument, it will use these parameters. This option is of
course privileged to root.</p>

<p>Exit Escape from this menu without saving. This can also
be done with ESC.</p>

<p>Exit from minicom Only root will see this menu entry, if
he/she started minicom with the -s option. This way, it is
possible to change the configura- tion without actually
running minicom.</p>

<p>STATUS LINE The status line has several indicators, that
speak for themselves. The mysterious APP or NOR indicator
probably needs explanation. The VT100 cursor keys can be in
two modes: applications mode and cursor mode. This is
controlled by an escape sequence. If you find that the
cursor keys do not work in, say, vi when youre logged in
using minicom then you can see with this indicator whether
the cursor keys are in applica- tions or cursor mode. You
can toggle the two with the C-A I key. If the cursor keys
then work, it s probably an error in the remote systems
termcap initialization strings (is).</p>

<p>LOCALES Minicom has support for local languages. This
means you can change most of the English messages and other
strings to another language by set- ting the environment
variable LANG.</p>

<p>MISC If minicom is hung, kill it with SIGTERM . (This
means kill -15, or since sigterm is default, just plain
&quot;kill &lt;minicompid&gt;&quot;. This will cause a
graceful exit of minicom, doing resets and everything. You
may kill minicom from a script with the command &quot;!
killall -9 minicom&quot; without hanging up the line.
Without the -9 parameter, minicom first hangs up before
exiting.</p>

<p>Since a lot of escape sequences begin with ESC (Arrow up
is ESC [ A), Minicom does not know if the escape character
it gets is you pressing the escape key, or part of a
sequence.</p>

<p>An old version of Minicom, V1.2, solved this in a rather
crude way: to get the escape key, you had to press it
twice.</p>

<p>As of release 1.3 this has bettered a little: now a
1-second timeout is builtin, like in vi. For systems that
have the select() system call the timeout is 0.5 seconds.
And... surprise: a special Linux-dependant hack :-) was
added. Now, minicom can separate the escape key and escape-
sequences. To see how dirty this was done, look into
wkeys.c. But it works like a charm!</p>

<p>FILES Minicom keeps it s configuration files in one
directory, usually /var/lib/minicom, /usr/local/etc or /etc.
To find out what default directory minicom has compiled in,
issue the command minicom -h. You ll probably also find the
demo files for runscript(1), and the examples of character
conversion tables either there or in the subdi- rectories of
/usr/doc/minicom*. The conversion tables are named some-
thing like mc.* in that directory, but you probably want to
copy the ones you need in your home directory as something
beginning with a dot.</p>

<p>minicom.users minirc.* $HOME/.minirc.* $HOME/.dialdir
$HOME/minicom.log
/usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/minicom.mo</p>

<p>SEE ALSO runscript(1)</p>

minicom-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org. Thank you!</p>
