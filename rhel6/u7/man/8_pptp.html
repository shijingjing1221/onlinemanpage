<p>PPTP(8) PPTP(8)</p>

<p>NAME pptp - PPTP driver</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pptp &lt;pptp-server-IP&gt;
&lt;pptp-options&gt; [ppp-options] ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pptp establishes the client side of a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) using the Point-to-Point
Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). Use this program to connect to an
employer s PPTP based VPN, or to certain cable and ADSL
service providers.</p>

<p>By default, pptp establishes the PPTP call to the PPTP
server, and then starts an instance of pppd to manage the
data transfer. However, pptp can also be run as a connection
manager within pppd.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The first non-option argument on the pptp
command line must be the host name or IP address of the PPTP
server.</p>

<p>All long options (starting with &quot;--&quot;) are
interpreted as pptp options, and a fatal error occurs if an
unrecognised option is used.</p>

<p>All command-line arguments which do not start with
&quot;-&quot; are interpreted as ppp options, and passed as
is to pppd unless --nolaunchpppd is given.</p>

<p>--phone &lt;number&gt; Pass &lt;number&gt; to remote
host as phone number</p>

<p>--nolaunchpppd Do not launch pppd but use stdin as the
network connection. Use this flag when including pptp as a
pppd connection process using the pty option. See
EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>--quirks &lt;quirk&gt; Work around a buggy PPTP
implementation, adopts special case handling for particular
PPTP servers and ADSL modems. Currently recognised values
are BEZEQ_ISRAEL only</p>

<p>--debug Run in foreground (for debugging with gdb)</p>

<p>--sync Enable Synchronous HDLC (pppd must use it
too)</p>

<p>--timeout &lt;secs&gt; Time to wait for reordered
packets (0.01 to 10 secs)</p>

<p>--nobuffer Completely disables buffering and reordering
of packets. Any --timeout specified will be ignored.</p>

<p>--idle-wait &lt;secs&gt; Time to wait before sending a
control connection echo request. The RFC2637 default is 60
seconds.</p>

<p>--max-echo-wait &lt;secs&gt; Time to wait for an echo
reply before closing the control con- nection. The RFC2637
default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>--logstring &lt;name&gt; Use &lt;name&gt; instead of
anon in syslog messages</p>

<p>--localbind &lt;addr&gt; Bind to specified IP address
instead of wildcard</p>

<p>--loglevel &lt;level&gt; Sets the debugging level
(0=low, 1=default, 2=high)</p>

<p>--test-type &lt;n&gt; Enable packet reordering tests
that damage the integrity of the packet stream to the
server. Use this only when testing servers. Zero is the
default, and means that packets are sent in the correct
order. A value of one (1) causes a single swap between two
packets, such that the sequence numbers might be 1 2 3 4 6 5
7 8 9. A value of two (2) causes ten packets to be buffered,
then sent out of order but ascending, such that the sequence
numbers might be 1 2 3 4 16 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 18
19 20. A value of three (3) causes ten packets to be
buffered, then sent in the reverse order, like this; 1 2 3 4
16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 17 18 19 20.</p>

<p>--test-rate &lt;n&gt; Sets the number of packets to pass
before causing a reordering test. Default is 100. Has no
effect if test-type is zero. The result of test types 2 and
3 are undefined if this value is less than ten.</p>

<p>QUIRKS BEZEQ_ISRAEL modifies packets to interoperate
with Orckit ADSL modems on the BEZEQ network in Israel.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Connection to a Microsoft Windows VPN
Server</p>

<p>pppd noauth nobsdcomp nodeflate require-mppe-128 name
domain\\user- name remotename PPTP pty &quot;pptp 10.0.0.5
--nolaunchpppd&quot;</p>

<p>Note that the chap-secrets file used by pppd must
include an entry for domain\username</p>

<p>STATISTICS The pptp process collects statistics when
sending and receiving GRE packets. They are intended to be
useful for debugging poor PPTP perfor- mance and for general
monitoring of link quality. The statistics are cumulative
since the pptp process was started.</p>

<p>The statistics can be viewed by sending a SIGUSR1 signal
to the &quot;GRE- to-PPP Gateway&quot; process, which will
cause it to dump them to the system logs (at the LOG_NOTICE
level). A better way to present the statistics to
applications is being sought (e.g. SNMP?).</p>

<p>The following statistics are collected at the time of
writing (April 2003):</p>

<p>rx accepted the number of GRE packets successfully
passed to PPP</p>

<p>rx lost the number of packets never received, and
presumed lost in the network</p>

<p>rx under win the number of packets which were duplicates
or had old sequence numbers (this might be caused by a
packet-reordering network if your reordering timeout is set
too low)</p>

<p>rx over win the number of packets which were too far
ahead in the sequence to be reordered (might be caused by
loss of more than 300 pack- ets in a row)</p>

<p>rx buffered the number of packets which were slightly
ahead of sequence, and were either buffered for reordering,
or if buffering is dis- abled, accepted immediately
(resulting in the intermediate pack- ets being
discarded).</p>

<p>rx OS errors the number of times where the operating
system reported an error when we tried to read a packet</p>

<p>rx truncated the number of times we received a packet
which was shorter than the length implied by the GRE
header</p>

<p>rx invalid the number of times we received a packet
which had invalid or unsupported flags set in the header,
wrong version, or wrong protocol.</p>

<p>rx acks the number of pure acknowledgements received
(without data). Too many of these will waste bandwidth, and
might be solved by tun- ing the remote host.</p>

<p>tx sent the number of GRE packets sent with data</p>

<p>tx failed the number of packets we tried to send, but
the OS reported an error</p>

<p>tx short the number of times the OS would not let us
write a complete packet</p>

<p>tx acks the number of times we sent a pure ack, without
data</p>

<p>tx oversize the number of times we couldn t send a
packet because it was over PACKET_MAX bytes long</p>

<p>round trip the estimated round-trip time in
milliseconds</p>
