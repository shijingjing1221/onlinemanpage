<p>GZIP(1) GZIP(1)</p>

<p>NAME gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gzip [ -acdfhlLnNrtvV19 ] [-S suffix]
[--rsyncable] [ name ... ] gunzip [ -acfhlLnNrtvV ] [-S
suffix] [ name ... ] zcat [ -fhLV ] [ name ... ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Gzip reduces the size of the named files
using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file
is replaced by one with the extension .gz, while keeping the
same ownership modes, access and modi- fication times. (The
default extension is -gz for VMS, z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT,
Windows NT FAT and Atari.) If no files are specified, or if
a file name is &quot;-&quot;, the standard input is
compressed to the standard output. Gzip will only attempt to
compress regular files. In particu- lar, it will ignore
symbolic links.</p>

<p>If the compressed file name is too long for its file
system, gzip trun- cates it. Gzip attempts to truncate only
the parts of the file name longer than 3 characters. (A part
is delimited by dots.) If the name consists of small parts
only, the longest parts are truncated. For example, if file
names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is
compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz. Names are not truncated on
systems which do not have a limit on file name length.</p>

<p>By default, gzip keeps the original file name and
timestamp in the com- pressed file. These are used when
decompressing the file with the -N option. This is useful
when the compressed file name was truncated or when the time
stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.</p>

<p>Compressed files can be restored to their original form
using gzip -d or gunzip or zcat. If the original name saved
in the compressed file is not suitable for its file system,
a new name is constructed from the original one to make it
legal.</p>

<p>gunzip takes a list of files on its command line and
replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, _z
or .Z and which begins with the correct magic number with an
uncompressed file without the original extension. gunzip
also recognizes the special extensions .tgz and .taz as
shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively. When
compressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary
instead of truncating a file with a .tar extension.</p>

<p>gunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip,
zip, compress, compress -H or pack. The detection of the
input format is automatic. When using the first two formats,
gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack, gunzip checks the
uncompressed length. The standard compress format was not
designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is
sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error
when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file
is correct simply because the standard uncompress does not
complain. This generally means that the standard uncompress
does not check its input, and happily generates garbage
output. The SCO compress -H format (lzh compression method)
does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency
checks.</p>

<p>Files created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if
they have a single member compressed with the deflation
method. This feature is only intended to help conversion of
tar.zip files to the tar.gz format. To extract a zip file
with a single member, use a command like gunzip &lt;foo.zip
or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip. To extract zip files with several
members, use unzip instead of gunzip.</p>

<p>zcat is identical to gunzip -c. (On some systems, zcat
may be installed as gzcat to preserve the original link to
compress.) zcat uncompresses either a list of files on the
command line or its standard input and writes the
uncompressed data on standard output. zcat will uncompress
files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
.gz suffix or not.</p>

<p>Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and
PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained depends on the
size of the input and the dis- tribution of common
substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English
is reduced by 60-70%. Compression is generally much better
than that achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman
coding (as used in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding
(compact).</p>

<p>Compression is always performed, even if the compressed
file is slightly larger than the original. The worst case
expansion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5
bytes every 32K block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for
large files. Note that the actual number of used disk blocks
almost never increases. gzip preserves the mode, ownership
and timestamps of files when compressing or
decompressing.</p>

<p>The gzip file format is specified in P. Deutsch, GZIP
file format spec- ification version 4.3,
&lt;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt&gt;, Inter- net
RFC 1952 (May 1996). The zip deflation format is specified
in P. Deutsch, DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification
version 1.3, &lt;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1951.txt&gt;,
Internet RFC 1951 (May 1996).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a --ascii Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines
using local conventions. This option is supported only on
some non-Unix systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF
when compressing, and LF is con- verted to CR LF when
decompressing.</p>

<p>-c --stdout --to-stdout Write output on standard output;
keep original files unchanged. If there are several input
files, the output consists of a sequence of independently
compressed members. To obtain better compression,
concatenate all input files before compressing them.</p>

<p>-d --decompress --uncompress Decompress.</p>

<p>-f --force Force compression or decompression even if
the file has multiple links or the corresponding file
already exists, or if the com- pressed data is read from or
written to a terminal. If the input data is not in a format
recognized by gzip, and if the option --stdout is also
given, copy the input data without change to the standard
output: let zcat behave as cat. If -f is not given, and when
not running in the background, gzip prompts to verify
whether an existing file should be overwritten.</p>

<p>-h --help Display a help screen and quit.</p>

<p>-l --list For each compressed file, list the following
fields:</p>

<p>compressed size: size of the compressed file
uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file ratio:
compression ratio (0.0% if unknown) uncompressed_name: name
of the uncompressed file</p>

<p>The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in
gzip for- mat, such as compressed .Z files. To get the
uncompressed size for such a file, you can use:</p>

<p>zcat file.Z | wc -c</p>

<p>In combination with the --verbose option, the following
fields are also displayed:</p>

<p>method: compression method crc: the 32-bit CRC of the
uncompressed data date &amp; time: time stamp for the
uncompressed file</p>

<p>The compression methods currently supported are deflate,
com- press, lzh (SCO compress -H) and pack. The crc is given
as ffffffff for a file not in gzip format.</p>

<p>With --name, the uncompressed name, date and time are
those stored within the compress file if present.</p>

<p>With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio
for all files is also displayed, unless some sizes are
unknown. With --quiet, the title and totals lines are not
displayed.</p>

<p>-L --license Display the gzip license and quit.</p>

<p>-n --no-name When compressing, do not save the original
file name and time stamp by default. (The original name is
always saved if the name had to be truncated.) When
decompressing, do not restore the original file name if
present (remove only the gzip suffix from the compressed
file name) and do not restore the original time stamp if
present (copy it from the compressed file). This option is
the default when decompressing.</p>

<p>-N --name When compressing, always save the original
file name and time stamp; this is the default. When
decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp
if present. This option is useful on systems which have a
limit on file name length or when the time stamp has been
lost after a file transfer.</p>

<p>-q --quiet Suppress all warnings.</p>

<p>-r --recursive Travel the directory structure
recursively. If any of the file names specified on the
command line are directories, gzip will descend into the
directory and compress all the files it finds there (or
decompress them in the case of gunzip ).</p>

<p>-S .suf --suffix .suf When compressing, use suffix .suf
instead of .gz. Any non-empty suffix can be given, but
suffixes other than .z and .gz should be avoided to avoid
confusion when files are transferred to other systems.</p>

<p>When decompressing, add .suf to the beginning of the
list of suffixes to try, when deriving an output file name
from an input file name.</p>

<p>pack(1).</p>

<p>-t --test Test. Check the compressed file integrity.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Verbose. Display the name and percentage
reduction for each file compressed or decompressed.</p>

<p>-V --version Version. Display the version number and
compilation options then quit.</p>

<p>-# --fast --best Regulate the speed of compression using
the specified digit #, where -1 or --fast indicates the
fastest compression method (less compression) and -9 or
--best indicates the slowest com- pression method (best
compression). The default compression level is -6 (that is,
biased towards high compression at expense of speed).</p>

<p>--rsyncable When you synchronize a compressed file
between two computers, this option allows rsync to transfer
only files that were changed in the archive instead of the
entire archive. Normally, after a change is made to any file
in the archive, the compres- sion algorithm can generate a
new version of the archive that does not match the previous
version of the archive. In this case, rsync transfers the
entire new version of the archive to the remote computer.
With this option, rsync can transfer only the changed files
as well as a small amount of metadata that is required to
update the archive structure in the area that was
changed.</p>

<p>ADVANCED USAGE Multiple compressed files can be
concatenated. In this case, gunzip will extract all members
at once. For example:</p>

<p>gzip -c file1 &gt; foo.gz gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt;
foo.gz</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>gunzip -c foo</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>cat file1 file2</p>

<p>In case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other
members can still be recovered (if the damaged member is
removed). However, you can get better compression by
compressing all members at once:</p>

<p>cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz</p>

<p>compresses better than</p>

<p>gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz</p>

<p>If you want to recompress concatenated files to get
better compression, do:</p>

<p>gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz</p>

<p>If a compressed file consists of several members, the
uncompressed size and CRC reported by the --list option
applies to the last member only. If you need the
uncompressed size for all members, you can use:</p>

<p>gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c</p>

<p>If you wish to create a single archive file with
multiple members so that members can later be extracted
independently, use an archiver such as tar or zip. GNU tar
supports the -z option to invoke gzip transparently. gzip is
designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT The environment variable GZIP can hold a set
of default options for gzip. These options are interpreted
first and can be overwritten by explicit command line
parameters. For example: for sh: GZIP=&quot;-8v
--name&quot;; export GZIP for csh: setenv GZIP &quot;-8v
--name&quot; for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name</p>

<p>On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is
GZIP_OPT, to avoid a conflict with the symbol set for
invocation of the program.</p>

<p>The gzip file format is specified in P. Deutsch, GZIP
file format spec- ification version 4.3,
&lt;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt&gt;, Inter- net
RFC 1952 (May 1996). The zip deflation format is specified
in P. Deutsch, DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification
version 1.3, &lt;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1951.txt&gt;,
Internet RFC 1951 (May 1996).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is normally 0; if an error
occurs, exit status is 1. If a warning occurs, exit status
is 2.</p>

<p>Usage: gzip [-cdfhlLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]
Invalid options were specified on the command line.</p>

<p>file: not in gzip format The file specified to gunzip
has not been compressed.</p>

<p>file: Corrupt input. Use zcat to recover some data. The
compressed file has been damaged. The data up to the point
of failure can be recovered using</p>

<p>zcat file &gt; recover</p>

<p>file: compressed with xx bits, can only handle yy bits
File was compressed (using LZW) by a program that could deal
with more bits than the decompress code on this machine.
Recom- press the file with gzip, which compresses better and
uses less memory.</p>

<p>file: already has .gz suffix -- no change The file is
assumed to be already compressed. Rename the file and try
again.</p>

<p>file already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
Respond &quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be
replaced; &quot;n&quot; if not.</p>

<p>gunzip: corrupt input A SIGSEGV violation was detected
which usually means that the input file has been
corrupted.</p>

<p>xx.x% Percentage of the input saved by compression.
(Relevant only for -v and -l.)</p>

<p>-- not a regular file or directory: ignored When the
input file is not a regular file or directory, (e.g. a
symbolic link, socket, FIFO, device file), it is left
unaltered.</p>

<p>-- has xx other links: unchanged The input file has
links; it is left unchanged. See ln(1) for more information.
Use the -f flag to force compression of multiply-linked
files.</p>

<p>CAVEATS When writing compressed data to a tape, it is
generally necessary to pad the output with zeroes up to a
block boundary. When the data is read and the whole block is
passed to gunzip for decompression, gunzip detects that
there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data
and emits a warning by default. You have to use the --quiet
option to suppress the warning. This option can be set in
the GZIP environment variable as in: for sh:
GZIP=&quot;-q&quot; tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0 for
csh: (setenv GZIP -q; tar -xfz --block-compr /dev/rst0</p>

<p>In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by the
-z option of GNU tar. Make sure that the same block size (-b
option of tar) is used for reading and writing compressed
data on tapes. (This example assumes you are using the GNU
version of tar.)</p>

<p>BUGS The gzip format represents the input size modulo
2^32, so the --list option reports incorrect uncompressed
sizes and compression ratios for uncompressed files 4 GB and
larger. To work around this problem, you can use the
following command to discover a large uncompressed files
true size:</p>

<p>zcat file.gz | wc -c</p>

<p>The --list option reports sizes as -1 and crc as
ffffffff if the com- pressed file is on a non seekable
media.</p>

<p>In some rare cases, the --best option gives worse
compression than the default compression level (-6). On some
highly redundant files, com- press compresses better than
gzip.</p>
