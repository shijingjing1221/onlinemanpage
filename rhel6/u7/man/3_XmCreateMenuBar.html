<p>NAME XmCreateMenuBar A RowColumn widget convenience
creation function</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;Xm/RowColumn.h&gt; Widget
XmCreateMenuBar( Widget parent, String name, ArgList
arglist, Cardinal argcount);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XmCreateMenuBar creates an instance of a
RowColumn widget of type XmMENU_BAR and returns the
associated widget ID. It is provided as a convenience
function for creating RowColumn widgets configured to oper-
ate as a MenuBar and is not implemented as a separate widget
class.</p>

<p>The MenuBar widget is generally used for building a
Pulldown menu sys- tem. Typically, a MenuBar is created and
placed along the top of the application window, and several
CascadeButtons are inserted as the children. Each of the
CascadeButtons has a Pulldown menu pane associ- ated with
it. These Pulldown menu panes must have been created as
children of the MenuBar. The user interacts with the MenuBar
by using either the mouse or the keyboard.</p>

<p>The MenuBar displays a 3-D shadow along its border. The
application controls the shadow attributes using the
visual-related resources sup- ported by XmManager.</p>

<p>The MenuBar widget is homogeneous in that it accepts
only children that are a subclass of XmCascadeButton or
XmCascadeButtonGadget. Attempting to insert a child of a
different class results in a warning message.</p>

<p>If the MenuBar does not have enough room to fit all of
its subwidgets on a single line, the MenuBar attempts to
wrap the remaining entries onto additional lines if allowed
by the geometry manager of the parent widget.</p>

<p>parent Specifies the parent widget ID</p>

<p>name Specifies the name of the created widget</p>

<p>arglist Specifies the argument list</p>

<p>argcount Specifies the number of attribute/value pairs
in the argument list (arglist)</p>

associated resources, see XmRowColumn(3).</p>

<p>RETURN Returns the RowColumn widget ID.</p>
