<p>Tcl_TraceCommand(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_TraceCommand(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_CommandTraceInfo, Tcl_TraceCommand,
Tcl_UntraceCommand - monitor renames and deletes of a
command</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>ClientData Tcl_CommandTraceInfo(interp, cmdName, flags,
proc, prevClientData)</p>

<p>int Tcl_TraceCommand(interp, cmdName, flags, proc,
clientData)</p>

<p>void Tcl_UntraceCommand(interp, cmdName, flags, proc,
clientData)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tcl_Interp *interp (in) Interpreter contain-
ing the command.</p>

<p>const char *cmdName (in) Name of command.</p>

<p>int flags (in) OR ed collection of the values
TCL_TRACE_RENAME and TCL_TRACE_DELETE.</p>

<p>Tcl_CommandTraceProc *proc (in) Procedure to call when
specified opera- tions occur to cmd- Name.</p>

<p>ClientData clientData (in) Arbitrary argument to pass to
proc.</p>

<p>ClientData prevClientData (in) If non-NULL, gives last
value returned by Tcl_CommandTrace- Info, so this call will
return informa- tion about next trace. If NULL, this call
will return information about first trace.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl_TraceCommand allows a C procedure to
monitor operations performed on a Tcl command, so that the C
procedure is invoked whenever the com- mand is renamed or
deleted. If the trace is created successfully then
Tcl_TraceCommand returns TCL_OK. If an error occurred (e.g.
cmdName specifies a non-existent command) then TCL_ERROR is
returned and an error message is left in the interpreters
result.</p>

<p>The flags argument to Tcl_TraceCommand indicates when
the trace proce- dure is to be invoked. It consists of an OR
ed combination of any of the following values:</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_RENAME Invoke proc whenever the command is
renamed.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_DELETE Invoke proc when the command is
deleted.</p>

<p>Whenever one of the specified operations occurs to the
command, proc will be invoked. It should have arguments and
result that match the type Tcl_CommandTraceProc: typedef
void Tcl_CommandTraceProc( ClientData clientData, Tcl_Interp
*interp, const char *oldName, const char *newName, int
flags); The clientData and interp parameters will have the
same values as those passed to Tcl_TraceCommand when the
trace was created. ClientData typ- ically points to an
application-specific data structure that describes what to
do when proc is invoked. OldName gives the name of the
command being renamed, and newName gives the name that the
command is being renamed to (or an empty string or NULL when
the command is being deleted.) Flags is an OR ed combination
of bits potentially providing several pieces of information.
One of the bits TCL_TRACE_RENAME and TCL_TRACE_DELETE will
be set in flags to indicate which operation is being
performed on the command. The bit TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED will
be set in flags if the trace is about to be destroyed; this
information may be useful to proc so that it can clean up
its own internal data structures (see the section
TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED below for more details). Lastly, the bit
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED will be set if the entire interpreter
is being destroyed. When this bit is set, proc must be
especially careful in the things it does (see the section
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED below).</p>

<p>Tcl_UntraceCommand may be used to remove a trace. If the
command spec- ified by interp, cmdName, and flags has a
trace set with flags, proc, and clientData, then the
corresponding trace is removed. If no such trace exists,
then the call to Tcl_UntraceCommand has no effect. The same
bits are valid for flags as for calls to
Tcl_TraceCommand.</p>

<p>Tcl_CommandTraceInfo may be used to retrieve information
about traces set on a given command. The return value from
Tcl_CommandTraceInfo is the clientData associated with a
particular trace. The trace must be on the command specified
by the interp, cmdName, and flags arguments (note that
currently the flags are ignored; flags should be set to 0
for future compatibility) and its trace procedure must the
same as the proc argument. If the prevClientData argument is
NULL then the return value corresponds to the first (most
recently created) matching trace, or NULL if there are no
matching traces. If the prevClientData argu- ment is not
NULL, then it should be the return value from a previous
call to Tcl_CommandTraceInfo. In this case, the new return
value will correspond to the next matching trace after the
one whose clientData matches prevClientData, or NULL if no
trace matches prevClientData or if there are no more
matching traces after it. This mechanism makes it possible
to step through all of the traces for a given command that
have the same proc.</p>

<p>CALLING COMMANDS DURING TRACES During rename traces, the
command being renamed is visible with both names
simultaneously, and the command still exists during delete
traces (if TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED is not set). However, there
is no mechanism for signaling that an error occurred in a
trace procedure, so great care should be taken that errors
do not get silently lost.</p>

<p>MULTIPLE TRACES It is possible for multiple traces to
exist on the same command. When this happens, all of the
trace procedures will be invoked on each access, in order
from most-recently-created to least-recently-created.
Attempts to delete the command during a delete trace will
fail silently, since the command is already scheduled for
deletion anyway. If the command being renamed is renamed by
one of its rename traces, that renaming takes precedence
over the one that triggered the trace and the collection of
traces will not be reexecuted; if several traces rename the
command, the last renaming takes precedence.</p>

<p>TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED FLAG In a delete callback to proc,
the TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED bit is set in flags.</p>

<p>TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED When an interpreter is destroyed,
unset traces are called for all of its commands. The
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED bit will be set in the flags argument
passed to the trace procedures. Trace procedures must be
extremely careful in what they do if the
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED bit is set. It is not safe for the
procedures to invoke any Tcl procedures on the interpreter,
since its state is partially deleted. All that trace
procedures should do under these circumstances is to clean
up and free their own internal data structures.</p>

<p>BUGS Tcl does not do any error checking to prevent trace
procedures from misusing the interpreter during traces with
TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED set.</p>
