<p>STRCMP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual STRCMP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME strcmp - compare two strings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;string.h&gt;</p>

<p>int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The strcmp() function shall compare the
string pointed to by s1 to the string pointed to by s2.</p>

<p>The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined
by the sign of the difference between the values of the
first pair of bytes (both interpreted as type unsigned char)
that differ in the strings being compared.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon completion, strcmp() shall return an
integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the
string pointed to by s1 is greater than, equal to, or less
than the string pointed to by s2, respectively.</p>

<p>ERRORS No errors are defined.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Checking a Password Entry The following example
compares the information read from standard input to the
value of the name of the user entry. If the strcmp()
function returns 0 (indicating a match), a further check
will be made to see if the user entered the proper old
password. The crypt() function shall encrypt the old
password entered by the user, using the value of the
encrypted password in the passwd structure as the salt. If
this value matches the value of the encrypted passwd in the
structure, the entered password oldpasswd is the correct
users password. Finally, the program encrypts the new
password so that it can store the information in the passwd
structure.</p>

<p>#include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... int valid_change; struct passwd
*p; char user[100]; char oldpasswd[100]; char
newpasswd[100]; char savepasswd[100]; ... if
(strcmp(p-&gt;pw_name, user) == 0) { if
(strcmp(p-&gt;pw_passwd, crypt(oldpasswd, p-&gt;pw_passwd))
== 0) { strcpy(savepasswd, crypt(newpasswd, user));
p-&gt;pw_passwd = savepasswd; valid_change = 1; } else {
fprintf(stderr, &quot;Old password is not valin&quot;); } }
...</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
