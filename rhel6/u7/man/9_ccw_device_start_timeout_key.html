<p>CCW_DEVICE_START_TIM(9) The ccw bus
CCW_DEVICE_START_TIM(9)</p>

<p>NAME ccw_device_start_timeout_key - start a s390 channel
program with timeout and key</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS int ccw_device_start_timeout_key(struct
ccw_device * cdev, struct ccw1 * cpa, unsigned long intparm,
__u8 lpm, __u8 key, unsigned long flags, int expires);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS cdev target ccw device</p>

<p>cpa logical start address of channel program</p>

<p>intparm user specific interruption parameter; will be
presented back to cdev&acute;s interrupt handler. Allows a
device driver to associate the interrupt with a particular
I/O request.</p>

<p>lpm defines the channel path to be used for a specific
I/O request. A value of 0 will make cio use the opm.</p>

<p>key storage key to be used for the I/O</p>

<p>flags additional flags; defines the action to be
performed for I/O processing.</p>

<p>expires timeout value in jiffies</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Start a S/390 channel program. When the
interrupt arrives, the IRQ handler is called, either
immediately, delayed (dev-end missing, or sense required) or
never (no IRQ handler registered). This function notifies
the device driver if the channel program has not completed
during the time specified by expires. If a timeout occurs,
the channel program is terminated via xsch, hsch or csch,
and the device&acute;s interrupt handler will be called with
an irb containing ERR_PTR(-ETIMEDOUT).</p>

<p>RETURNS 0, if the operation was successful; -EBUSY, if
the device is busy, or status pending; -EACCES, if no path
specified in lpm is operational; -ENODEV, if the device is
not operational.</p>

<p>CONTEXT Interrupts disabled, ccw device lock held</p>
