<p>NAME vbox.conf - config file for vbox</p>

<p>Description This file is used to configure when and on
what conditions calls are taken. It can also be used to
define which CALLERID is used with which person.</p>

<p>Everything after the &quot;#&quot; is ignored, as are
empty lines. All arguments must be separated by whitespace
(spaces, tabs). Arguments may not con- tain whitespace.</p>

<p>This file consists of several sections. A section begins
with &quot;[&quot; NAME &quot;]&quot;. The section name is
case insensitive. A section ends at the end of the file or
at the end of a new section.</p>

<p>These sections exist:</p>

<p>[CALLERIDS] This section maps CALLERID to persons and
what settings to use.</p>

<p>On an incoming call the CALLERID of the caller is
detected and compared with this section. The SECTION of the
first match is used.</p>

<p>Format : PATTERN SECTION REALNAME</p>

<p>PATTERN UN*X Pattern of a CALLERID. You may not use
whitespace.</p>

<p>SECTION Name of a user section to use. You many not use
whitespace. With a &quot;-&quot; STANDARD will be used, with
a &quot;*&quot; the REALNAME will be used.</p>

<p>REALNAME Full name of the person that should be mapped
to the CAL- LERID. Here you may use spaces.</p>

<p>At the end of the [CALLERIDS] Section, you should have
the entry &quot;* - *** Unknown ***&quot;, so that also
calls with no or unknown CALLERID can be processed.</p>

<p>[RINGS] In this section you set when and after how many
RINGs a call is taken.</p>

<p>This section is the first to be examined when a call is
incoming to determine if the call should be taken. The
number of RINGs can be overruled in the user section.</p>

<p>Format : TIME DAYS RINGS</p>

<p>TIME time when the call should be taken. Read the
isdntime(5) man page for details.</p>

<p>DAYS days when the call should be takes. Read the
isdntime(5) man page for details.</p>

<p>RINGS Number of rings to wait before taking the call.
With version 2.0 of the hisax isdn device driver the
interval between two rings is longer (now it s nearly like a
telephone; 4 - 5 seconds between rings).</p>

<p>user defined sections Here you can make individual
settings for some people. The sec- tion name has the same
format as the other sections. The names CALLERIDS and RINGS
are reserved.</p>

<p>Format : TIME DAYS MESSAGE RECTIME [FLAG] [...]</p>

<p>TIME time when the call should be taken. Read the
isdntime(5) man page for details.</p>

<p>DAYS days when the call should be taken. Read the
isdntime(5) man page for details.</p>

<p>MESSAGE Standard message to play for this call. You must
either give the filename with full path, or a filename
relative to /var/spool/vbox/&lt;user&gt;/messages. Default
is &quot;standard.msg&quot;. You may not use spaces or
tabs.</p>

<p>RECTIME Time in seconds: how long should vboxgetty
record? Default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p>FLAGS You can additionally give these flags:</p>

<p>NOANSWER Don t answer this call. Default is to
answer.</p>

<p>NORECORD Don t record a message. Default is to
record.</p>

<p>NOTIMEOUTMSG Don t play timeout message. Default is to
play.</p>

<p>NOBEEPMSG Dont play beep message. Default is to
play.</p>

<p>NOSTDMSG Don t play std message. Default is to play.</p>

<p>RINGS= Number of rings to wait before taking the call.
Here you can override the [RINGS] section.</p>

<p>TOLLRINGS= Number of rings to wait before answering the
call, if new messages are available. This flag overrides the
sec- tion [RINGS] and the flag RINGS= if there are new mes-
sages. The directory to search for new messages must be
given with TOLLCHECK (or you can use the default).</p>

<p>TOLLCHECK= Directory to search for new messages. Default
is /var/spool/vbox/&lt;user&gt;/incoming.</p>

<p>SCRIPT= TCL-Script to start after taking the call. This
must be the full path or a filename relative to
/var/spool/vbox/&lt;user&gt;. The default is
standard.tcl.</p>

<p>FILES /var/spool/vbox/&lt;user&gt;/vbox.conf this
configuration file.</p>
