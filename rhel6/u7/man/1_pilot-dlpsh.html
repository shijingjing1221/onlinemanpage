<p>pilot-dlpsh(1) PILOT-LINK pilot-dlpsh(1)</p>

<p>NAME pilot-dlpsh - An interactive Desktop Link Protocol
(DLP) Shell for your Palm device.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-dlpsh [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[-c|--command STRING] [-i|--interac- tive] [--version]</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-dlpsh options -c, --command STRING</p>

<p>Execute cmd and exit immediately.</p>

<p>-i, --interactive</p>

<p>Enter interactive mode</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port &lt; port&gt;</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the
Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-dlpsh will
look for the $PILOTPORT environment variable. If the port is
missing and $PILOTPORT is not set, pilot-dlpsh will print
the usage information.</p>

<p>--version</p>

<p>Display the copyright information, version number,
license details and build details and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pilot-dlpsh allows the user to connect to a
Palm handheld and execute arbitrary DLP commands.</p>

<p>pilot-dlpsh can query many different types of
information from your Palm device, such as username, memory
capacity, set the time, as well as other useful
functions.</p>

<p>Once connected, the user may execute most of the
built-in DLP commands. (See BUILT-IN COMMANDS below for more
detail on currently supported options).</p>

<p>The connection to the Pilot is kept alive by sending a
PadTickle packet to the Pilot after a small period of
non-activity. (7 seconds by default)</p>

<p>BUILT-IN COMMANDS There are many options available while
connected to your Palm handheld via pilot-dlpsh, including
the following:</p>

<p>user, u</p>

<p>Print the currently set User information, including
Username, UserID, PCid, and ViewerID. You may also set these
values from this command as well. To set these values,
simply pass the value to the option, such as user John Q.
Public for example.</p>

<p>ls</p>

<p>Used with -l and -r to provide long and RAM and ROM file
lists, similar to (but slightly different from) the Unix ls
command. This does not yet allow you to narrow your listing
to a certain range of files. It will simply list them
all.</p>

<p>df</p>

<p>Display how much RAM and ROM is free on your device,
again similar to the Unix df command. This does not accept
arguments at this time.</p>

<p>ntp, time, dtp</p>

<p>Set the time on the Palm from the currently-set desktop
time. This does not work on OS version 3.3, due to a bug in
PalmOS at that time.</p>

<p>rm, del</p>

<p>Remove a file and delete it entirely from the Palm
device. This is an irrevokable process, and you cannot
&quot;undelete&quot; a file, once it has been deleted with
this command.</p>

<p>quit, q, exit, bye</p>

<p>Exit the DLP Protocol Shell</p>

<p>OPTIONS Passing commandline options to pilot-dlpsh will
allow you to interact with it in unattended mode, for
example: pilot-dlpsh -p usb: -c user will connect and
display the user information, just as if you had con- nected
interactively and typed user at the DLP shell prompt.</p>

<p>USAGE The program will connect to your Palm handheld and
give the user an interactive prompt (a &quot;shell&quot;)
for executing commands across the DLP HotSync protocol.</p>
