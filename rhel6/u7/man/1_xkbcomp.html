<p>NAME xkbcomp - compile XKB keyboard description</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS xkbcomp [option] source [ destination ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The xkbcomp keymap compiler converts a
description of an XKB keymap into one of several output
formats. The most common use for xkbcomp is to create a
compiled keymap file (.xkm extension) which can be read
directly by XKB-capable X servers or utilities. The keymap
compiler can also produce C header files or XKB source
files. The C header files produced by xkbcomp can be
included by X servers or utilities that need a built-in
default keymap. The XKB source files produced by xkbcomp are
fully resolved and can be used to verify that the files
which typically make up an XKB keymap are merged correctly
or to create a single file which contains a complete
description of the keymap.</p>

<p>The source may specify an X display, or an .xkb or .xkm
file; unless explicitly specified, the format of destination
depends on the format of the source. Compiling a .xkb
(keymap source) file generates a .xkm (compiled keymap file)
by default. If the source is a .xkm file or an X display,
xkbcomp generates a keymap source file by default.</p>

<p>If the destination is an X display, the keymap for the
display is updated with the compiled keymap.</p>

<p>The name of the destination is usually computed from the
name of the source, with the extension replaced as
appropriate. When compiling a single map from a file which
contains several maps, xkbcomp constructs the destination
file name by appending an appropriate extension to the name
of the map to be used.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Show all keyboard information, reporting
implicit or derived information as a comment. Only affects
.xkb format output.</p>

<p>-C Produce a C header file as output (.h extension).</p>

<p>-dflts Compute defaults for any missing components, such
as key names.</p>

<p>-Idir Specifies top-level directories to be searched for
files included by the keymap description. After all
directories specified by -I options have been searched, the
current direc- tory and finally, the default xkb directory
(usually /usr/lib/X11/xkb) will be searched.</p>

<p>To prevent the current and default directories from
being searched, use the -I option alone (i.e. without a
directory), before any -I options that specify the
directories you do want searched.</p>

<p>-i deviceid If source or destination is a valid X
display, load the keymap from/into the device with the
specified ID (not name).</p>

<p>-l List maps that specify the map pattern in any files
listed on the command line (not implemented yet).</p>

<p>-m name Specifies a map to be compiled from an file with
multiple entries.</p>

<p>-merge Merge the compiled information with the map from
the server (not implemented yet).</p>

<p>-o name Specifies a name for the generated output file.
The default is the name of the source file with an
appropriate extension for the output format.</p>

<p>-opt parts Specifies a list of optional parts.
Compilation errors in any optional parts are not fatal.
Parts may consist of any combi- nation of the letters c,
g,k,s,t which specify the compatibil- ity map, geometry,
keycodes, symbols and types, respectively.</p>

<p>-Rdir Specifies the root directory for relative path
names.</p>

<p>-synch Force synchronization for X requests.</p>

<p>-version Print version number.</p>

<p>-w lvl Controls the reporting of warnings during
compilation. A warn- ing level of 0 disables all warnings; a
warning level of 10 enables them all.</p>

<p>-xkb Generate a source description of the keyboard as
output (.xkb extension).</p>

<p>-xkm Generate a compiled keymap file as output (.xkm
extension).</p>
