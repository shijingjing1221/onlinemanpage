<p>TCSETPGRP(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
TCSETPGRP(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tcsetpgrp - set the foreground process group ID</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int tcsetpgrp(int fildes, pid_t pgid_id);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION If the process has a controlling terminal,
tcsetpgrp() shall set the foreground process group ID
associated with the terminal to pgid_id. The application
shall ensure that the file associated with fildes is the
controlling terminal of the calling process and the
controlling terminal is currently associated with the
session of the calling pro- cess. The application shall
ensure that the value of pgid_id matches a process group ID
of a process in the same session as the calling pro-
cess.</p>

<p>Attempts to use tcsetpgrp() from a process which is a
member of a back- ground process group on a fildes
associated with its controlling termi- nal shall cause the
process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling
process is blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process
shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is
sent.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, 0 shall be
returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tcsetpgrp() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EBADF The fildes argument is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>

<p>EINVAL This implementation does not support the value in
the pgid_id argument.</p>

<p>ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling
terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal, or
the controlling termi- nal is no longer associated with the
session of the calling pro- cess.</p>

<p>EPERM The value of pgid_id is a value supported by the
implementation, but does not match the process group ID of a
process in the same session as the calling process.</p>
