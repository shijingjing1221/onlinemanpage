<p>PMNSADD(1) PMNSADD(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmnsadd - add new names to the Performance Co-Pilot
PMNS</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmnsadd [-n namespace] file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmnsmerge(1) performs the same function as
pmnsadd and is faster, more robust and more flexible. It is
therefore recommended that pmnsmerge(1) be used instead.</p>

<p>pmnsadd adds subtree(s) of new names into a Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).</p>

<p>Normally pmnsadd operates on the default Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative namespace is used from the file
namespace.</p>

<p>The default PMNS is found in the file
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root unless the environment variable
PMNS_DEFAULT is set, in which case the value is assumed to
be the pathname to the file containing the default PMNS.</p>

<p>The new names are specified in the file, arguments and
conform to the syntax for PMNS specifications, see pmns(5).
There is one PMNS subtree in each file, and the base PMNS
pathname to the inserted subtree is identified by the first
group named in each file, e.g. if the specifi- cations
begin</p>

<p>myagent.foo.stuff { mumble 123:45:1 fumble 123:45:2
}</p>

<p>then the new names will be added into the PMNS at the
non-leaf position identified by myagent.foo.stuff, and
following all other names with the prefix myagent.foo.</p>

<p>The new names must be contained within a single subtree
of the names- pace. If disjoint subtrees need to be added,
these must be packaged into separate files and pmnsadd used
on each, one at a time.</p>

<p>All of the files defining the PMNS must be located
within the directory that contains the root of the PMNS,
this would typically be $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns for the default
PMNS, and this would typically imply running pmnsadd as
root.</p>

<p>As a special case, if file contains a line that begins
root { then it is assumed to be a complete PMNS that needs
to be merged, so none of the subtree extraction and
rewriting is performed and file is handed directly to
pmnsmerge(1).</p>

<p>Provided some initial integrity checks are satisfied,
pmnsadd will update the PMNS using pmnsmerge(1) - if this
fails for any reason, the original namespace remains
unchanged.</p>

<p>CAVEAT Once the writing of the new namespace file has
begun, the signals SIG- INT, SIGHUP and SIGTERM will be
ignored to protect the integrity of the new files.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root the default PMNS, when then
environment vari- able PMNS_DEFAULT is unset</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

pcp.env(5) and pmns(5).</p>
