<p>NAME libxml - library used to parse XML files</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The libxml library is used to parse XML
files. Its internal document repesentation is as close as
possible to the DOM (Document Object Model) interface, an
API for accessing XML or HTML structured docu- ments.</p>

<p>The libxml library also has a SAX-like interface, which
is designed to be compatible with expat(1). NOTE: SAX, the
Simple API for XML, is a standard interface for event-based
XML parsing, developed collabora- tively by the members of
the XML-DEV mailing list, currently hosted by OASIS. The
expat library is a XML 1.0 parser written in C, which aims
to be fully conforming. It is currently not a validating XML
proces- sor.</p>

<p>The libxml library now includes a nearly complete XPath
implementation. The XPath (XML Path Language) is a language
for addressing parts of an XML document, designed to be used
by both XSLT and XPointer.</p>

<p>The libxml library exports Push and Pull type parser
interfaces for both XML and html.</p>
