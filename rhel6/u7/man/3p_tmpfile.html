<p>TMPFILE(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual TMPFILE(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME tmpfile - create a temporary file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>FILE *tmpfile(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The tmpfile() function shall create a
temporary file and open a corre- sponding stream. The file
shall be automatically deleted when all ref- erences to the
file are closed. The file is opened as in fopen() for update
(w+).</p>

<p>In some implementations, a permanent file may be left
behind if the process calling tmpfile() is killed while it
is processing a call to tmpfile().</p>

<p>An error message may be written to standard error if the
stream cannot be opened.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, tmpfile() shall
return a pointer to the stream of the file that is created.
Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set errno to
indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The tmpfile() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINTR A signal was caught during tmpfile().</p>

<p>EMFILE {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in
the calling process.</p>

<p>ENFILE The maximum allowable number of files is
currently open in the system.</p>

<p>ENOSPC The directory or file system which would contain
the new file cannot be expanded.</p>

<p>EOVERFLOW The file is a regular file and the size of the
file cannot be represented correctly in an object of type
off_t.</p>

<p>The tmpfile() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EMFILE {FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the
calling process.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient storage space is available.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Creating a Temporary File The following example
creates a temporary file for update, and returns a pointer
to a stream for the created file in the fp variable.</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; ... FILE *fp;</p>

<p>fp = tmpfile ();</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE It should be possible to open at least
{TMP_MAX} temporary files during the lifetime of the program
(this limit may be shared with tmpnam()) and there should be
no limit on the number simultaneously open other than this
limit and any limit on the number of open files (
{FOPEN_MAX}).</p>

<p>RATIONALE None.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
