<p>NAME vfs_commit - flush dirty data at specified
intervals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS vfs objects = commit</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This VFS module is part of the samba(7)
suite.</p>

<p>The vfs_commit VFS module keeps track of the amount of
data written to a file and synchronizes it to disk when a
specified amount accumulates.</p>

<p>vfs_commit is useful in two circumstances. First, if you
have very precious data, the impact of unexpected power loss
can be minimized by a small commit:dthresh value. Secondly,
write performance can be improved on some systems by
flushing file data early and at regular intervals.</p>

<p>This module is stackable.</p>

<p>OPTIONS commit:dthresh = BYTES Synchronize file data
each time the specified number of bytes has been
written.</p>

<p>The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:</p>

<p>&middot; K - BYTES is a number of kilobytes</p>

<p>&middot; M - BYTES is a number of megabytes</p>

<p>&middot; G - BYTES is a number of gigabytes</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Synchronize the file data on the [precious]
share after every 512 kilobytes (524288 bytes) of data is
written:</p>

<p>[precious] path = /data/precious vfs objects = commit
commit:dthresh = 512K</p>

<p>CAVEATS On some systems, the data synchronization
performed by commit may reduce performance.</p>

<p>VERSION This man page is correct for version 3.0.25 of
the Samba suite.</p>

<p>AUTHOR The original Samba software and related utilities
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way
the Linux kernel is developed.</p>
