<p>gnutls_prf_raw(3) gnutls gnutls_prf_raw(3)</p>

<p>NAME gnutls_prf_raw - access the TLS PRF directly</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</p>

<p>int gnutls_prf_raw(gnutls_session_t session, size_t
label_size, const char * label, size_t seed_size, const char
* seed, size_t outsize, char * out);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS gnutls_session_t session is a gnutls_session_t
structure.</p>

<p>size_t label_size length of the label variable.</p>

<p>const char * label label used in PRF computation,
typically a short string.</p>

<p>size_t seed_size length of the seed variable.</p>

<p>const char * seed optional extra data to seed the PRF
with.</p>

<p>size_t outsize size of pre-allocated output buffer to
hold the output.</p>

<p>char * out pre-allocate buffer to hold the generated
data.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Apply the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF)
using the master secret on some data.</p>

<p>The label variable usually contain a string denoting the
purpose for the generated data. The seed usually contain
data such as the client and server random, perhaps together
with some additional data that is added to guarantee
uniqueness of the output for a particular purpose.</p>

<p>Because the output is not guaranteed to be unique for a
particular ses- sion unless seed include the client random
and server random fields (the PRF would output the same data
on another connection resumed from the first one), it is not
recommended to use this function directly. The gnutls_prf()
function seed the PRF with the client and server ran- dom
fields directly, and is recommended if you want to generate
pseudo random data unique for each session.</p>

<p>RETURNS GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on success, or an error
code.</p>
