<p>NAME pbmtext - render text into a PBM image</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pbmtext [-font fontfile] [-builtin fontname]
[-space pixels] [-lspace pixels] [-nomargins] [-width
pixels] [text]</p>

<p>Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You
may use dou- ble hyphens instead of single hyphen to denote
options. You may use white space in place of the equals sign
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>pbmtext takes the specified text, either a single line
from the command line or multiple lines from standard input,
and renders it into a PBM graphical image.</p>

<p>In the image, each line of input is a line of output.
Formatting char- acters such as newline have no effect on
the formatting; like any unprintable character, they turn
into spaces.</p>

<p>The image is just wide enough for the longest line of
text, plus mar- gins, and just high enough to contain the
lines of text, plus margins.</p>

<p>The left and right margins are twice the width of the
widest character in the font; the top and bottom margins are
the height of the tallest character in the font. But if the
text is only one line, all the mar- gins are half of this.
You can use the -nomargins option to eliminate the
margins.</p>

<p>pbmtextps does the same thing as pbmtext, but uses
Ghostscript to gen- erate the characters, which means you
can use Postscript fonts. But it also means you have to have
Ghostscript installed and it isnt as fast. Also, pbmtextps
generates only one line of text, whereas pbmtext can create
multiple lines.</p>

<p>pbmtext is meant for small quantities of simple text. If
youre work- ing with a document, you would be better off
using a document format- ting program to print to a
Postscript file, then feeding that Postscript to
pstopnm.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -font</p>

<p>-builtin -builtin selects a font among those built into
Netpbm.</p>

<p>-font selects a font that you supply yourself either as
an X Window System BDF (Bitmap Distribution Format) file or
as a PBM file in a special form.</p>

<p>The default is the built in font bdf.</p>

<p>bdf is Times-Roman 15 pixels high. (Thats about 14 point
type printed at 75 dpi).</p>

<p>fixed is a built in fixed width font.</p>

<p>For information about other fonts, and how to make one
of your own, see Fonts below.</p>

<p>-space pixels Add pixels pixels of space between
characters. This is in addition to whatever space
surrounding characters is built into the font, which is
usually enough to produce a reasonable string of text.</p>

<p>pixels may be fractional, in which case the number of
pixels added varies so as to achieve the specified average.
For exam- ple -space=1.5 causes half the spaces to be 1
pixel and half to be 2 pixels.</p>

<p>pixels may be negative to crowd text together, but the
author has not put much thought or testing into how this
works in every possible case, so it might cause disastrous
results.</p>

<p>-lspace pixels Add pixels pixels of space between lines.
This is in addition to whatever space above and below
characters is built into the font, which is usually enough
to produce a reasonable line spac- ing.</p>

<p>pixels must be a whole number.</p>

<p>pixels may be negative to crowd lines together, but the
author has not put much thought or testing into how this
works in every possible case, so it might cause disastrous
results.</p>

<p>-nomargins By default, pbmtext adds margins all around
the image as described above. This option causes pbmtext not
to add any mar- gins.</p>

<p>Note that there may still be space beyond the edges of
the type because a character itself may include space at its
edges. To eliminate all surrounding background, so the type
touches all four edges of the image, use pnmcrop.</p>

<p>-width pixels This specifies how much horizontal space
the text is supposed to fit into.</p>

<p>If the input is one line, pbmtext breaks it into
multiple lines as needed to fit the specified width. It
breaks it between characters, but does not pay attention to
white space; it may break in the middle of a word and a line
may begin or end with white space.</p>

<p>If the input is multiple lines, pbmtext assumes you
already have line breaks where they make sense, and pbmtext
simply truncates each line as needed to fit the specified
width.</p>

<p>USAGE Often, you want to place text over another image.
One way to do this is with ppmlabel. ppmlabel does not give
you the font options that pbmtext does, though.</p>

<p>Another way is to use pbmtext to create an image
containing the text, then use pamcomp to overlay the text
image onto your base image. To make only the text (and not
the entire rectangle containing it) cover the base image,
you will need to give pamcomp a mask, via its -alpha option.
You can just use the text image itself as the mask, as long
as you also specify the -invert option to pamcomp.</p>

<p>If you want to overlay colored text instead of black,
just use ppm- change to change all black pixels to the color
of your choice before overlaying the text image. But still
use the original black and white image for the alpha
mask.</p>

<p>If you want the text at an angle, use pnmrotate on the
text image (and alpha mask) before overlaying.</p>

<p>FONTS There are three kinds of fonts you an use with
pbmtext:</p>

<p>&middot; built in</p>

<p>&middot; BDF</p>

<p>&middot; PBM</p>

<p>BDF Font BDF is an ancient font format that at one time
was standard for the X Window System. Now, you dont see it
very often, but you can find some BDF fonts on the Xfree86
web site.</p>

<p>You can get the full package of the BDF fonts from
XFree86 (see above) from the Netpbm web site .</p>

<p>PBM Font To create a font as a PBM file (to use with the
-font option), you just create a PBM image of the text
matrix below.</p>

<p>The first step is to display text matrix below on the
screen, e.g. in an X11 window.</p>

<p>M ,/^_[jpqy| M</p>

<p>/ !#$%&amp;()*+ / &lt; ,-./01234567 &lt; &gt;
89:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABC &gt; @ DEFGHIJKLMNO @ _ PQRSTUVWXYZ[ _ {
]^_abcdefg { } hijklmnopqrs } ~ tuvwxyz{|}~ ~</p>

<p>M ,/^_[jpqy| M</p>

<p>Make sure its a fixed width font -- This should display
as a perfect rectangle.</p>

<p>Also, try to use a simple display program. Pbmtext
divides this into a matrix of cells, all the same size, each
containing one character, so it is important that whatever
you use to display it display with uniform horizontal and
vertical spacing. Fancy word processing pro- grams sometimes
stretch characters in both directions to fit certain
dimensions, and that won t work. Sometimes a display program
scales a font to show a character larger or smaller than its
natural size. That too wont often work because the rounding
involved in such scaling causes non-uniform distances
between characters.</p>

<p>If you display the text matrix improperly, the usual
symptom is that when you try to use the font, pbmtext fails
with an error message telling you that the number of lines
in the font isn t divisible by 11, or it can t find the
blank band around the inner rectangle. Sometimes the symptom
is that one of the characters displays with a piece of the
character that is next to it in the matrix. For example, l
might display with a little piece of the m attached on its
right.</p>

<p>Do a screen grab or window dump of that text, using for
instance xwd, xgrabsc, or screendump. Convert the result
into a pbm file. If neces- sary, use pamcut to remove
anything you grabbed in addition to the text pictured above
(or be a wimp and use a graphical editor such as
ImageMagick). Finally, run it through pnmcrop. to make sure
the edges are right up against the text. pbmtext can figure
out the sizes and spacings from that.</p>
