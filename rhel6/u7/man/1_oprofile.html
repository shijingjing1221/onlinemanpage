<p>OPROFILE(1) OPROFILE(1)</p>

<p>NAME oprofile - a system-wide profiler</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS opcontrol [ options ] opreport [ options ] [
profile specification ] opannotate [ options ] [ profile
specification ] oparchive [ options ] [ profile
specification ] opgprof [ options ] [ profile specification
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OProfile is a profiling system for systems
running Linux 2.6 and greater. Profiling runs transparently
in the background and profile data can be collected at any
time. OProfile makes use of the hardware performance
counters provided on Intel, AMD, and other processors, and
uses a timer-interrupt based mechanism on CPUs without
counters. OPro- file can profile the whole system in high
detail. For a gentle guide to using OProfile, please read
the HTML documenta- tion listed in SEE ALSO.</p>

<p>OPCONTROL opcontrol is used for starting and stopping
the OProfile daemon, and providing set-up parameters.</p>

<p>OPREPORT opreport gives image and symbol-based profile
summaries for the whole system or a subset of binary
images.</p>

<p>OPANNOTATE opannotate can produce annotated source or
mixed source and assembly output.</p>

<p>OPARCHIVE oparchive produces oprofile archive for
offline analysis</p>

<p>OPGPROF opgprof can produce a gprof-format profile for a
single binary.</p>

<p>PROFILE SPECIFICATIONS All of the post-profiling tools
can take profile specifications, which is some combination
of the following parameters. Enclosing part of a profile
specification in curly braces { } can be used for
differential profiles with opreport ; the braces must be
surrounded by whitespace.</p>

<p>archive:archive Path to the archive to inspect, as
generated by oparchive</p>

<p>session:sessionlist A comma-separated list of session
names to resolve in. Absence of this tag, unlike all others,
means &quot;the current session&quot;, equivalent to
specifying &quot;session:current&quot;.</p>

<p>session-exclude:sessionlist A comma-separated list of
sessions to exclude.</p>

<p>image:imagelist A comma-separated list of image names to
resolve. Each entry may be relative path, glob-style name,
or full path, e.g. opreport
image:/usr/bin/oprofiled,*op*,./oprofpp</p>

<p>image-exclude:imagelist Same as image:, but the matching
images are excluded.</p>

<p>lib-image:imagelist Same as image:, but only for images
that are for a particular primary binary image (namely, an
application). This only makes sense to use if you re using
--separate. This includes kernel modules and the kernel when
using --separate=kernel.</p>

<p>lib-image-exclude:imagelist Same as
&lt;option&gt;lib-image:&lt;/option&gt;, but the matching
images are excluded.</p>

<p>event:eventname The symbolic event name to match on,
e.g. event:DATA_MEM_REFS.</p>

<p>count:eventcount The event count to match on, e.g.
event:DATA_MEM_REFS count:30000.</p>

<p>unit-mask:maskvalue The unit mask value of the event to
match on, e.g. unit-mask:1.</p>

<p>cpu:cpulist Only consider profiles for the given
numbered CPU (starting from zero). This is only useful when
using CPU profile separation.</p>

<p>tgid:pidlist Only consider profiles for the given task
groups. Unless some program is using threads, the task group
ID of a process is the same as its process ID. This option
corresponds to the POSIX notion of a thread group. This is
only useful when using per- process profile separation.</p>

<p>tid:tidlist Only consider profiles for the given
threads. When using recent thread libraries, all threads in
a process share the same task group ID, but have different
thread IDs. You can use this option in combination with
tgid: to restrict the results to particular threads within a
process. This is only useful when using per- process profile
separation.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT No special environment variables are
recognised by oprofile.</p>
