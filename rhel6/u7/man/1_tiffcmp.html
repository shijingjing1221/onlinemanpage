<p>NAME tiffcmp - compare two TIFF files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tiffcmp [ options ] file1.tif file2.tif</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tiffcmp compares the tags and data in two
files created according to the Tagged Image File Format,
Revision 6.0. The schemes used for com- pressing data in
each file are immaterial when data are compared-data are
compared on a scanline-by-scanline basis after
decompression. Most directory tags are checked; notable
exceptions are: GrayResponseCurve, ColorResponseCurve, and
ColorMap tags. Data will not be compared if any of the
BitsPerSample, SamplesPerPixel, or ImageWidth values are not
equal. By default, tiffcmp will terminate if it encounters
any differ- ence.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l List each byte of image data that differs
between the files.</p>

<p>-z number List specified number of image data bytes that
differs between the files.</p>

<p>-t Ignore any differences in directory tags.</p>

<p>BUGS Tags that are not recognized by the library are not
compared; they may also generate spurious diagnostics.</p>

<p>The image data of tiled files is not compared, since the
TIFFReadScan- line() function is used. An error will be
reported for tiled files.</p>

<p>The pixel and/or sample number reported in differences
may be off in some exotic cases.</p>
