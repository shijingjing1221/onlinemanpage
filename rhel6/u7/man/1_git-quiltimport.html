<p>GIT-QUILTIMPORT(1) Git Manual GIT-QUILTIMPORT(1)</p>

<p>NAME git-quiltimport - Applies a quilt patchset onto the
current branch</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS git quiltimport [--dry-run | -n] [--author
&lt;author&gt;] [--patches &lt;dir&gt;]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Applies a quilt patchset onto the current
git branch, preserving the patch boundaries, patch order,
and patch descriptions present in the quilt patchset.</p>

<p>For each patch the code attempts to extract the author
from the patch description. If that fails it falls back to
the author specified with --author. If the --author flag was
not given the patch description is displayed and the user is
asked to interactively enter the author of the patch.</p>

<p>If a subject is not found in the patch description the
patch name is preserved as the 1 line subject in the git
description.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -n, --dry-run Walk through the patches in the
series and warn if we cannot find all of the necessary
information to commit a patch. At the time of this writing
only missing author information is warned about.</p>

<p>--author Author Name &lt;Author Email&gt; The author
name and email address to use when no author information can
be found in the patch description.</p>

<p>--patches &lt;dir&gt; The directory to find the quilt
patches and the quilt series file.</p>

<p>The default for the patch directory is patches or the
value of the $QUILT_PATCHES environment variable.</p>
