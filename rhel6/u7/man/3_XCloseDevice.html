<p>XOPENDEVICE(3) XOPENDEVICE(3)</p>

<p>NAME XOpenDevice, XCloseDevice - open or close an
extension input device</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>XDevice *XOpenDevice( Display *display, XID
device_id);</p>

<p>XCloseDevice( Display *display, XDevice *device);</p>

<p>display Specifies the connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device_id Specifies the id of the device to be
opened</p>

<p>device Specifies the device to be closed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The XOpenDevice request makes an input
device accessible to a client through input extension
protocol requests. If successful, it returns a pointer to an
XDevice structure.</p>

<p>The XCloseDevice request makes an input device
inaccessible to a client through input extension protocol
requests. Before terminating, and client that has opened
input devices through the input extension should close them
via CloseDevice.</p>

<p>When a client makes an XCloseDevice request, any active
grabs that the client has on the device are released. Any
event selections that the client has are deleted, as well as
any passive grabs. If the requesting client is the last
client accessing the device, the server may disable all
access by X to the device.</p>

<p>XOpenDevice and XCloseDevice can generate a BadDevice
error.</p>

<p>Structures</p>

<p>The XDevice structure returned by XOpenDevice contains:
typedef struct { XID device_id; int num_classes;
XInputClassInfo *classes; } XDevice;</p>

<p>The classes field is a pointer to an array of
XInputClassInfo structures. Each element of this array
contains an event type base for a class of input supported
by the specified device. The num_classes field indicates the
number of elements in the classes array.</p>

<p>The XInputClassInfo structure contains:</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned char input_class; unsigned
char event_type_base; } XInputClassInfo;</p>

<p>The input_class field identifies one class of input
supported by the device. Defined types include KeyClass,
ButtonClass, ValuatorClass, ProximityClass, FeedbackClass,
FocusClass, and OtherClass. The event_type_base identifies
the event type of the first event in that class.</p>

<p>The information contained in the XInputClassInfo
structure is used by macros to obtain the event classes that
clients use in making XSelectExtensionEvent requests.
Currently defined macros include DeviceKeyPress,
DeviceKeyRelease, DeviceButtonPress, DeviceButtonRelese,
DeviceMotionNotify, DeviceFocusIn, DeviceFocusOut,
ProximityIn, ProximityOut, DeviceStateNotify,
DeviceMappingNotify, ChangeDeviceNotify,
DevicePointerMotionHint, DeviceButton1Motion,
DeviceButton2Motion, DeviceButton3Motion,
DeviceButton4Motion, DeviceButton5Motion,
DeviceButtonMotion, DeviceOwnerGrabButton,
DeviceButtonPressGrab, and NoExtensionEvent.</p>

<p>To obtain the proper event class for a particular
device, one of the above macros is invoked using the XDevice
structure for that device. For example, DeviceKeyPress
(*device, type, eventclass);</p>

<p>returns the DeviceKeyPress event type and the eventclass
for DeviceKeyPress events from the specified device.</p>

<p>This eventclass can then be used in an
XSelectExtensionEvent request to ask the server to send
DeviceKeyPress events from this device. When a selected
event is received via XNextEvent, the type can be used for
comparison with the type in the event.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist, or is the X keyboard or
X pointer. This error may also occur if some other client
has caused the specified device to become the X keyboard or
X pointer device via the XChangeKeyboardDevice or
XChangePointerDevice requests.</p>
