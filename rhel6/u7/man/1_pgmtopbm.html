<p>NAME pgmtopbm - convert a PGM image to PBM</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pgmtopbm</p>

<p>[-floyd | -fs | -threshold | -hilbert | -dither8 | -d8 |
-cluster3 | -c3 | -cluster4 | -c4 | -cluster8 | -c8]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>This program is obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).
Use pamditherbw(1)todowhatthisprogram used to do.</p>

<p>pgmtopbm never was the simple converter it appeared to
be. It was a dithering program. Unfortunately, it didn t do
the dithering properly because it treated the PGM input
samples as if they were directly pro- portional to light
intensity, but they are actually gamma-adjusted.</p>

<p>pamditherbw is backward compatible with pgmtopbm except
that it</p>

<p>&middot; does the correct gamma adjustments.</p>

<p>&middot; produces PAM output instead of PBM. (Modern
Netpbm programs that accept PBM input also accept PAM input,
but if you need actual PBM, you can use pamtopbm with
pamditherbw).</p>

<p>So use the manual for pamditherbw for pgmtopbm, except
ignore anything that says it was added after Netpbm Release
10.23 and ignore any options that are not shown in the
synopsis above.</p>
