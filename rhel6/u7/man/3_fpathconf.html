<p>FPATHCONF(3) Linux Programmer s Manual FPATHCONF(3)</p>

<p>NAME fpathconf, pathconf - get configuration values for
files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>long fpathconf(int fd, int name); long pathconf(char
*path, int name);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fpathconf() gets a value for the
configuration option name for the open file descriptor
fd.</p>

<p>pathconf() gets a value for configuration option name
for the filename path.</p>

<p>The corresponding macros defined in &lt;unistd.h&gt; are
minimum values; if an application wants to take advantage of
values which may change, a call to fpathconf() or pathconf()
can be made, which may yield more liberal results.</p>

<p>Setting name equal to one of the following constants
returns the fol- lowing configuration options:</p>

<p>_PC_LINK_MAX returns the maximum number of links to the
file. If fd or path refer to a directory, then the value
applies to the whole direc- tory. The corresponding macro is
_POSIX_LINK_MAX.</p>

<p>_PC_MAX_CANON returns the maximum length of a formatted
input line, where fd or path must refer to a terminal. The
corresponding macro is _POSIX_MAX_CANON.</p>

<p>_PC_MAX_INPUT returns the maximum length of an input
line, where fd or path must refer to a terminal. The
corresponding macro is _POSIX_MAX_INPUT.</p>

<p>_PC_NAME_MAX returns the maximum length of a filename in
the directory path or fd that the process is allowed to
create. The corresponding macro is _POSIX_NAME_MAX.</p>

<p>_PC_PATH_MAX returns the maximum length of a relative
pathname when path or fd is the current working directory.
The corresponding macro is _POSIX_PATH_MAX.</p>

<p>_PC_PIPE_BUF returns the size of the pipe buffer, where
fd must refer to a pipe or FIFO and path must refer to a
FIFO. The corresponding macro is _POSIX_PIPE_BUF.</p>

<p>_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED returns non-zero if the chown(2)
call may not be used on this file. If fd or path refer to a
directory, then this applies to all files in that directory.
The corresponding macro is _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED.</p>

<p>_PC_NO_TRUNC returns non-zero if accessing filenames
longer than _POSIX_NAME_MAX generates an error. The
corresponding macro is _POSIX_NO_TRUNC.</p>

<p>_PC_VDISABLE returns non-zero if special character
processing can be dis- abled, where fd or path must refer to
a terminal.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE The limit is returned, if one exists. If
the system does not have a limit for the requested resource,
-1 is returned, and errno is unchanged. If there is an
error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to reflect the
nature of the error.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>NOTES Files with name lengths longer than the value
returned for name equal to _PC_NAME_MAX may exist in the
given directory.</p>

<p>Some returned values may be huge; they are not suitable
for allocating memory.</p>
