<p>PMLC(1) PMLC(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmlc - configure active Performance Co-Pilot
pmlogger(s) interactively</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmlc [-e] [-h host] [-i] [-n pmnsfile] [-P] [-p
port] [-Z timezone] [-z] [pid]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmlc may be used to change those metrics and
instances which a pmlog- ger(1) writes to a Performance
Co-Pilot archive (see PCPIntro(1)), the frequency with which
the metrics are collected and whether the logging is
mandatory, advisory, on or off. It also reports the current
logging status of metrics and instances. pmlc may be used to
control pmlogger instances on remote hosts as well as those
on the local host.</p>

<p>Normally pmlc operates on the distributed Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file
pmnsfile.</p>

<p>If the -P option is specified, pmlc will attempt to
start with a con- nection to the primary pmlogger on the
local host. If the -p option is specified, then pmlc will
attempt to start with a connection to the pmlogger on this
TCP/IP port. Alternatively, if pid is specified, a
connection to the pmlogger instance with that process id
will be attempted on startup. The -h option may only be used
if -P, -p port or a pid is also specified. In that case pmlc
will initially connect to the specified (remote) pmlogger
instance on host rather than the local host. If the
connection to the specified pmlogger instance cannot be
established, pmlc will start with no connection. These
options typi- cally allow the same file of pmlc commands to
be directed to multiple pmlogger instances by varying the
command line arguments. Note that -P, -p port, pid and -h
are used only when making an initial connection to a
pmlogger instance. They are not used as defaults if
subsequent connections are made interactively (see the
connect command below).</p>

<p>By default, pmlc reports the time of day according to
the local time- zone on the system where pmlc is run. The -Z
option changes the time- zone to timezone in the format of
the environment variable TZ as described in environ(5). The
-z option changes the timezone to the timezone of the
pmlogger instance from which information is being obtained.
Only one of -z or -Z may be specified.</p>

<p>If standard input is from a tty, pmlc is interactive,
with prompts. The -i flag may be used to force interactive
behavior, and is typically used in conjunction with -e to
echo all command input on standard out- put.</p>

<p>The following commands may be used:</p>

<p>show [ loggers ] [ @host ] Displays the process
identities of all pmlogger instances running on the local
host (or host, if specified). The primary pmlogger pid is
parenthesized because it can be referred to as
&quot;primary&quot; as well as by its pid.</p>

<p>connect pid [ @host ] connect primary [ @host ] Connects
pmlc to the specified pmlogger process. Any existing con-
nection to a pmlogger instance is closed first. Each
pmlogger instance will accept at most one connection at a
time, so if the connection is successfully established, your
pmlc will be the only one controlling the pmlogger instance
it is connected to.</p>

<p>new volume This command works only while a connection to
a pmlogger instance is established. It tells the pmlogger to
close the current volume of the log and open a new volume.
Closed volumes may be archived, e.g. as part of a regular
log management procedure to control the size of the physical
log files.</p>

<p>status This command works only while a connection to a
pmlogger instance is established. It prints information
about the state of the pmlogger instance and its associated
log.</p>

<p>timezone local | logger | &quot;timezone&quot; This
command sets the time zone used when times are printed.
local means use the time zone of the machine that pmlc is
running on. logger means use the time zone of the machine
where the pmlogger instance is running. Alternatively an
explicit timezone enclosed in quotes may be supplied (refer
to TZ in environ(5) for details). The default time zone is
local unless one of the -z or -Z options has been supplied
on the command line.</p>

<p>flush This command works only while a connection to a
pmlogger instance is established, and requests the pmlogger
instance to flush to disk all buffers associated with the
current archive. For old-timers, sync is a synonym for
flush. In current versions of pmlogger(1) all writes are
unbuffered and aligned with the logical records in the
external files, so this command achieves nothing, but is
retained for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>help Displays a summary of the available commands. h and
? are synonyms for help.</p>

<p>quit Exits from pmlc.</p>

<p>The remaining commands query and change the logging
state of metrics and instances. They will work only if pmlc
has a connection to a pmlogger instance. Metrics may be
specified as fully qualified names (e.g. hinv.ncpu) or
subtrees of the PMNS (e.g. hinv) which are expanded to
include all metrics in the subtree (e.g. hinv.ncpu,
hinv.cpuclock, etc.). Lists of metrics may be specified by
enclosing them in braces with spaces or a comma between
metrics (e.g. {hinv.ncpu hinv.ndisk}). Subtrees of metrics
may be included in such lists.</p>

<p>Each individual metric specification may be further
qualified with a space or comma separated list of instances
in square brackets (e.g. kernel.all.load[&quot;1
minute&quot;, &quot;5 minute&quot;]). External instance
names or numeric internal instance identifiers or both may
be used in the same list (e.g.
sample.colour.[red,1,&quot;blue&quot;]). If an instance
qualification is applied to a subtree of the PMNS all of the
metrics in the subtree must have the same instance domain.
Instance qualifications may not be applied to entire lists
of metrics but may appear inside such lists.</p>

<p>If no instances are specified for a metric, all
instances are used. All instances means all instances
available at the time the pmlogger instance in question
fetches the metrics for logging. If an instance domain
changes over time this is not always the same as the set of
instances displayed by pmlc, which can only display the
currently available instances. To prevent unintentional
errors, only the instances that are currently available to
pmlc may appear in instance specifications.</p>

<p>query metriclist The current logging state of each
metric (and instances, where applicable) in metriclist is
displayed. This includes the logging state (e.g. on, maybe,
off) and the logging interval for each met- ric (and
instance) requested. The following abbreviations pertain-
ing to metrics (and instances) may appear in the output:
adv, advi- sory; mand, mandatory; nl, not in the log; na, in
the log but not currently available from its Performance
Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA). Where appropriate, an instance
name will appear last on a line preceded by its numeric
internal instance identifier.</p>

<p>[ log ] mandatory on interval metriclist This form of
the log command turns on logging for the metrics (and any
instances) in metriclist. interval specifies how often the
specified metrics/instances should be logged. once indicates
that the metrics/instances should appear at most once in the
log. More often one would use the optional keyword every
followed by a posi- tive number and one of millisecond (or
msec), second (or sec), minute (or min), hour or their
plurals. Note that the keyword default which may be used for
the default interval in a pmlogger(1) configuration file
cannot be used in pmlc. Internal limitations require the
interval to be less than (approxi- mately) 74 hours. An
interval value of zero is a synonym for once.</p>

<p>[ log ] mandatory off metriclist This tells the pmlogger
instance not to log any of the met- rics/instances in
metriclist.</p>

<p>[ log ] mandatory maybe metriclist This tells the
pmlogger instance to honor any subsequent advisory logging
requests for the metrics/instances in metriclist. If the
current logging state of the metrics/instances is mandatory
(either on or off) the new state will be set to maybe
(effectively advisory off). If the current state of the
metrics/instances is already advisory (either on or off) the
state(s) for the metrics/instances will remain as they
are.</p>

<p>[ log ] advisory on interval metriclist [ log ] advisory
off metriclist Advisory logging is only applicable if the
last logging state spec- ified for a metric/instance was
&quot;mandatory maybe&quot; (which permits subsequent
advisory logging control) or if the logging state is already
advisory. These two statements turn advisory logging on or
off (respectively) for the specified metrics/instances. The
interpretation for interval is as above for the mandatory
case.</p>

<p>There is no continuation character required for commands
that span lines.</p>

<p>The word at may be used interchangeably with @.</p>

<p>A request to log all instances of a metric will
supersede any prior request to log either all or specific
instances of a metric (if the request specifies a
permissible transition in the logging state). A request to
log specific instances of a metric when all instances of a
metric are already being logged is refused by pmlogger.</p>

<p>ACCESS CONTROL pmlc may have restricted access to and
control over pmlogger(1) pro- cesses.</p>

<p>If a pmlogger(1) is unable to export its control
information to the local pmcd(1), then that pmlogger(1)
cannot cannot be connected to nor controlled by pmlc. In
practice, this means the pmlogger(1) process has to be owned
by the user pcp and/or the group pcp. If pmlogger(1) is
running on the host foo then use pminfo -f -h foo
pmcd.pmlogger to verify that the pmlogger(1) of interest is
known to pmcd(1), alternatively pmlogger(1) instances that
are not reported from the pmlc show loggers @foo command are
not known to pmcd(1) on the host foo.</p>

<p>If pmlogger(1) is launched with a configuration file
that contains an [access] section, then pmlc will be unable
to connect to that pmlog- ger(1) unless the access controls
allow some access from the host where pmlc is being run.
Minimally this requires the enquire access to be permitted
in the pmlogger(1) access control section.</p>

<p>If pmlc is able to connect to the pmlogger(1) of
interest, then the following table summarizes the
permissions needed to perform different pmlc commands:</p>


<p>+------------------+---------------------------------------+
| pmlc command | Required pmlogger access |
+------------------+---------------------------------------+
|show loggers | Any | |connect | Any of enquire, advisory or
mandatory | |status | Any of enquire, advisory or mandatory
| |query ... | Any of enquire, advisory or mandatory | |log
advisory ... | advisory | |log mandatory ... | mandatory |
|new volume | mandatory |
+------------------+---------------------------------------+
PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names used
by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>SEE ALSO PCPIntro(1), pmcd(1), pmdumplog(1),
pmlogger(1), pcp.conf(5), pcp.env(5) and environ(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Most error or warning messages are
self-explanatory. A message of the form Warning: unable to
change logging state for... followed by a list of metrics
(and possibly instances) indicates that pmlogger refused the
request for the metrics (and instances) that appear. Any
metrics (and instances) that were specified but do not
appear in the message have had their logging state updated
successfully (no news is good news). Usually this warning
results from requesting advisory logging when a mandatory
control is already in place, or requesting logging for
specific instances when all instances are already being
logged.</p>

<p>CAVEAT If all instances of a metric are being logged and
a request is made to log specific instances of the metric
with the same state and frequency, the request may appear to
succeed, even though pmlogger has refused the request. This
is not normally a problem, as the required information will
still be placed into the log by pmlogger.</p>

<p>However in the case where the metric is to be logged
once, the outcome is not what might be expected. When
pmlogger receives a request to log a metric once, it places
the current value(s) of the metric into the log as soon as
it can, regardless of whether the metric is already in the
log. This may be used to force values into the log. When a
request to log specific instances of a metric arrives and is
refused because all instances of the metric are already
being logged, pmlogger does not place values for the
instances requested into the log. It returns the current
logging state for each instance requested to pmlc. The
requested and returned states are identical, so pmlc doesnt
raise an error as it should.</p>

<p>To ensure that only certain instances of a metric are
being logged, one should always turn off logging for all
instances of the metric prior to turning on logging for the
specific instances required.</p>
