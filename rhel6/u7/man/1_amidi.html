<p>NAME amidi - read from and write to ALSA RawMIDI
ports</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS amidi [-p port] [-s file | -S data] [-r file]
[-d] [-t seconds] [-a]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION amidi is a command-line utility which allows
one to receive and send SysEx (system exclusive) data
from/to external MIDI devices. It can also send any other
MIDI commands.</p>

<p>amidi handles only files containing raw MIDI commands,
without timing information. amidi does not support Standard
MIDI (.mid) files, but aplaymidi(1) and arecordmidi(1)
do.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Use the -h, -V, -l, or -L options to display
information; or use at least one of the -s, -r, -S, or -d
options to specify what data to send or receive.</p>

<p>-h, --help Help: prints a list of options.</p>

<p>-V, --version Prints the current version.</p>

<p>-l, --list-devices Prints a list of all hardware MIDI
ports.</p>

<p>-L, --list-rawmidis Prints all RawMIDI definitions.
(used when debugging configura- tion files)</p>

<p>-p, --port=name Sets the name of the ALSA RawMIDI port
to use. If this is not specified, amidi uses the default
port defined in the configura- tion file (the default for
this is port 0 on card 0, which may not exist).</p>

<p>-s, --send=filename Sends the contents of the specified
file to the MIDI port. The file must contain raw MIDI
commands (e.g. a .syx file); for Standard MIDI (.mid) files,
use aplaymidi(1).</p>

<p>-r, --receive=filename Writes data received from the
MIDI port into the specified file. The file will contain raw
MIDI commands (such as in a .syx file); to record a Standard
MIDI (.mid) file, use arecord- midi(1).</p>

<p>amidi will filter out any Active Sensing bytes (FEh),
unless the -a option has been given.</p>

<p>-S, --send-hex=&quot;...&quot; Sends the bytes specified
as hexadecimal numbers to the MIDI port.</p>

<p>-d, --dump Prints data received from the MIDI port as
hexadecimal bytes. Active Sensing bytes (FEh) will not be
shown, unless the -a option has been given.</p>

<p>This option is useful for debugging.</p>

<p>-t, --timeout=seconds Stops receiving data when no data
has been received for the specified amount of time.</p>

<p>If this option has not been given, you must press Ctrl+C
(or kill amidi) to stop receiving data.</p>

<p>-a, --active-sensing Does not ignore Active Sensing
bytes (FEh) when saving or print- ing received MIDI
commands.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES amidi -p hw:0 -s my_settings.syx will send the
MIDI commands in my_settings.syx to port hw:0.</p>

<p>amidi -SF0 43 10 4C 00 00 7E 00 F7 sends an XG Reset to
the default port.</p>

<p>amidi -p hw:1,2 -S F0411042110C000000000074F7 -r
dump.syx -t 1 sends a Parameter Dump Request to a GS device,
saves the received parameter data to the file dump.syx, and
stops after the device has finished sending data (when no
data has been received for one second).</p>

<p>amidi -p virtual -d creates a virtual RawMIDI port and
prints all data sent to this port.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf default rawmidi
definitions /etc/asound.conf system-wide rawmidi definitions
~/.asoundrc user specific rawmidi definitions</p>
