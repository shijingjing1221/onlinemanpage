<p>ACL_EXTENDED_FILE(3) BSD Library Functions Manual
ACL_EXTENDED_FILE(3)</p>

<p>NAME acl_extended_file, acl_extended_file_nofollow -
test for information in ACLs by file name</p>

<p>LIBRARY Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl,
-lacl).</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;acl/libacl.h&gt;</p>

<p>int acl_extended_file(const char *path_p);</p>

<p>int acl_extended_file_nofollow(const char *path_p);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The acl_extended_file() function returns 1
if the file or directory referred to by the argument path_p
is associated with an extended access ACL, or if the
directory referred to by path_p is associated with a default
ACL. The function returns 0 if the file has neither an
extended access ACL nor a default ACL.</p>

<p>An extended ACL is an ACL that contains entries other
than the three required entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ,
ACL_GROUP_OBJ and ACL_OTHER. If the result of the
acl_extended_file() function for a file object is 0, then
ACLs define no discretionary access rights other than those
already defined by the traditional file permission bits.</p>

<p>Access to the file object may be further restricted by
other mechanisms, such as Mandatory Access Control schemes.
The access(2) system call can be used to check whether a
given type of access to a file object would be granted.</p>

<p>acl_extended_file_nofollow() is identical to
acl_extended_file(), except in the case of a symbolic link,
where the link itself is interrogated, not the file that it
refers to. Since symbolic links have no ACL them- selves,
the operation is supposed to fail on them.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If successful, the acl_extended_file()
function returns 1 if the file object referred to by path_p
has an extended access ACL or a default ACL, and 0 if the
file object referred to by path_p has neither an extended
access ACL nor a default ACL. Otherwise, the value -1 is
returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate
the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS If any of the following conditions occur, the
acl_extended_file() func- tion returns -1 and sets errno to
the corresponding value:</p>

<p>[EACCES] Search permission is denied for a component of
the path prefix.</p>

<p>[ENAMETOOLONG] The length of the argument path_p is too
long.</p>

<p>[ENOENT] The named object does not exist or the argument
path_p points to an empty string.</p>

<p>[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>[ENOTSUP] The file system on which the file identified
by path_p is located does not support ACLs, or ACLs are dis-
abled.</p>

<p>STANDARDS This is a non-portable, Linux specific
extension to the ACL manipulation functions defined in IEEE
Std 1003.1e draft 17 (POSIX.1e, abandoned).</p>
