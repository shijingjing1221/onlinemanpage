<p>PERLFAQ3(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ3(1)</p>

<p>NAME perlfaq3 - Programming Tools</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This section of the FAQ answers questions
related to programmer tools and programming support.</p>

<p>How do I do (anything)? Have you looked at CPAN (see
perlfaq2)? The chances are that someone has already written
a module that can solve your problem. Have you read the
appropriate manpages? Heres a brief index:</p>

<p>Basics perldata, perlvar, perlsyn, perlop, perlsub
Execution perlrun, perldebug Functions perlfunc Objects
perlref, perlmod, perlobj, perltie Data Structures perlref,
perllol, perldsc Modules perlmod, perlmodlib, perlsub
Regexes perlre, perlfunc, perlop, perllocale Moving to perl5
perltrap, perl Linking w/C perlxstut, perlxs, perlcall,
perlguts, perlembed Various
http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz (not a
man-page but still useful, a collection of various essays on
Perl techniques)</p>

<p>A crude table of contents for the Perl manpage set is
found in perltoc.</p>

<p>How can I use Perl interactively? The typical approach
uses the Perl debugger, described in the perldebug(1)
manpage, on an &quot;empty&quot; program, like this:</p>

<p>perl -de 42</p>

<p>Now just type in any legal Perl code, and it will be
immediately evaluated. You can also examine the symbol
table, get stack backtraces, check variable values, set
breakpoints, and other operations typically found in
symbolic debuggers.</p>

<p>Is there a Perl shell? The psh (Perl sh) is currently at
version 1.8. The Perl Shell is a shell that combines the
interactive nature of a Unix shell with the power of Perl.
The goal is a full featured shell that behaves as expected
for normal shell activity and uses Perl syntax and
functionality for control-flow statements and other things.
You can get psh at http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh/
.</p>

<p>Zoidberg is a similar project and provides a shell
written in perl, configured in perl and operated in perl. It
is intended as a login shell and development environment. It
can be found at
http://pardus-larus.student.utwente.nl/~pardus/projects/zoidberg/
or your local CPAN mirror.</p>

<p>The Shell.pm module (distributed with Perl) makes Perl
try commands which arent part of the Perl language as shell
commands. perlsh from the source distribution is simplistic
and uninteresting, but may still be what you want.</p>

<p>How do I find which modules are installed on my system?
From the command line, you can use the &quot;cpan&quot;
command s &quot;-l&quot; switch:</p>

<p>$ cpan -l</p>

<p>You can also use &quot;cpan&quot; s &quot;-a&quot;
switch to create an autobundle file that &quot;CPAN.pm&quot;
understands and cna use to re-install every module:</p>

<p>$ cpan -a</p>

<p>Inside a Perl program, you can use the
ExtUtils::Installed module to show all installed
distributions, although it can take awhile to do its magic.
The standard library which comes with Perl just shows up as
&quot;Perl&quot; (although you can get those with
Module::CoreList).</p>

<p>use ExtUtils::Installed;</p>

<p>my $inst = ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new(); my @modules =
$inst-&gt;modules();</p>

<p>If you want a list of all of the Perl module filenames,
you can use File::Find::Rule.</p>

<p>use File::Find::Rule;</p>

<p>my @files = File::Find::Rule-&gt; extras({follow =&gt;
1})-&gt; file()-&gt; name( &rsquo;*.pm&rsquo; )-&gt; in(
@INC ) ;</p>

<p>If you do not have that module, you can do the same
thing with File::Find which is part of the standard
library.</p>

<p>use File::Find; my @files;</p>

<p>find( { wanted =&gt; sub { push @files,
$File::Find::fullname if -f $File::Find::fullname &amp;&amp;
/.pm$/ }, follow =&gt; 1, follow_skip =&gt; 2, }, @INC
);</p>

<p>print join &quot;0, @files;</p>

<p>If you simply need to quickly check to see if a module
is available, you can check for its documentation. If you
can read the documentation the module is most likely
installed. If you cannot read the documentation, the module
might not have any (in rare cases).</p>

<p>$ perldoc Module::Name</p>

<p>You can also try to include the module in a one-liner to
see if perl finds it.</p>

<p>$ perl -MModule::Name -e1</p>

<p>How do I debug my Perl programs? (contributed by brian d
foy)</p>

<p>Before you do anything else, you can help yourself by
ensuring that you let Perl tell you about problem areas in
your code. By turning on warnings and strictures, you can
head off many problems before they get too big. You can find
out more about these in strict and warnings.</p>

<p>#!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings;</p>

<p>Beyond that, the simplest debugger is the
&quot;print&quot; function. Use it to look at values as you
run your program:</p>

<p>print STDERR &quot;The value is [$value]0;</p>

<p>The &quot;Data::Dumper&quot; module can pretty-print
Perl data structures:</p>

<p>use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper ); print STDERR &quot;The
hash is &quot; . Dumper( hash ) . &quot;0;</p>

<p>Perl comes with an interactive debugger, which you can
start with the &quot;-d&quot; switch. Its fully explained in
perldebug.</p>

<p>If you d like a graphical user interface and you have
Tk, you can use &quot;ptkdb&quot;. Its on CPAN and available
for free.</p>

<p>If you need something much more sophisticated and
controllable, Leon Brocard s Devel::ebug (which you can call
with the -D switch as -Debug) gives you the programmatic
hooks into everything you need to write your own (without
too much pain and suffering).</p>

<p>You can also use a commercial debugger such as Affrus
(Mac OS X), Komodo from Activestate (Windows and Mac OS X),
or EPIC (most platforms).</p>

<p>How do I profile my Perl programs? (contributed by brian
d foy, updated Fri Jul 25 12:22:26 PDT 2008)</p>

<p>The &quot;Devel&quot; namespace has several modules
which you can use to profile your Perl programs. The
&quot;Devel::DProf&quot; module comes with Perl and you can
invoke it with the &quot;-d&quot; switch:</p>

<p>perl -d:DProf program.pl</p>

<p>After running your program under &quot;DProf&quot;, you
ll get a tmon.out file with the profile data. To look at the
data, you can turn it into a human-readable report with the
&quot;dprofpp&quot; program that comes with
&quot;Devel::DProf&quot;.</p>

<p>dprofpp</p>

<p>You can also do the profiling and reporting in one step
with the &quot;-p&quot; switch to &lt;dprofpp&gt;:</p>

<p>dprofpp -p program.pl</p>

<p>The &quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot; (New York Times Profiler)
does both statement and subroutine profiling. Its available
from CPAN and you also invoke it with the &quot;-d&quot;
switch:</p>

<p>perl -d:NYTProf some_perl.pl</p>

<p>Like &quot;DProf&quot;, it creates a database of the
profile information that you can turn into reports. The
&quot;nytprofhtml&quot; command turns the data into an HTML
report similar to the &quot;Devel::Cover&quot; report:</p>

<p>nytprofhtml</p>

<p>CPAN has several other profilers that you can invoke in
the same fashion. You might also be interested in using the
&quot;Benchmark&quot; to measure and compare code
snippets.</p>

<p>You can read more about profiling in Programming Perl,
chapter 20, or Mastering Perl, chapter 5.</p>

<p>perldebguts documents creating a custom debugger if you
need to create a special sort of profiler. brian d foy
describes the process in The Perl Journal, &quot;Creating a
Perl Debugger&quot;, http://www.ddj.com/184404522 , and
&quot;Profiling in Perl&quot; http://www.ddj.com/184404580
.</p>

<p>Perl.com has two interesting articles on profiling:
&quot;Profiling Perl&quot;, by Simon Cozens,
http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/850 and &quot;Debugging and
Profiling mod_perl Applications&quot;, by Frank Wiles,
http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html
.</p>

<p>Randal L. Schwartz writes about profiling in
&quot;Speeding up Your Perl Programs&quot; for Unix Review,
http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html , and
&quot;Profiling in Template Toolkit via Overriding&quot; for
Linux Magazine,
http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col75.html .</p>

<p>How do I cross-reference my Perl programs? The B::Xref
module can be used to generate cross-reference reports for
Perl programs.</p>

<p>perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] scriptname.plx</p>

<p>Is there a pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl? Perltidy
is a Perl script which indents and reformats Perl scripts to
make them easier to read by trying to follow the rules of
the perlstyle. If you write Perl scripts, or spend much time
reading them, you will probably find it useful. It is
available at http://perltidy.sourceforge.net</p>

<p>Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in
perlstyle, you shouldnt need to reformat. The habit of
formatting your code as you write it will help prevent bugs.
Your editor can and should help you with this. The perl-mode
or newer cperl-mode for emacs can provide remarkable amounts
of help with most (but not all) code, and even less
programmable editors can provide significant assistance. Tom
Christiansen and many other VI users swear by the following
settings in vi and its clones:</p>

<p>set ai sw=4 map! ^O {^M}^[O^T</p>

<p>Put that in your .exrc file (replacing the caret
characters with control characters) and away you go. In
insert mode, ^T is for indenting, ^D is for undenting, and
^O is for blockdenting--as it were. A more complete example,
with comments, can be found at
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz</p>

<p>The a2ps
http://www-inf.enst.fr/%7Edemaille/a2ps/black+white.ps.gz
does lots of things related to generating nicely printed
output of documents.</p>

<p>Is there a ctags for Perl? (contributed by brian d
foy)</p>

<p>Ctags uses an index to quickly find things in source
code, and many popular editors support ctags for several
different languages, including Perl.</p>

<p>Exuberent ctags supports Perl:
http://ctags.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>You might also try pltags:
http://www.mscha.com/pltags.zip</p>

<p>Is there an IDE or Windows Perl Editor? Perl programs
are just plain text, so any editor will do.</p>

<p>If youre on Unix, you already have an IDE--Unix itself.
The UNIX philosophy is the philosophy of several small tools
that each do one thing and do it well. Its like a carpenters
toolbox.</p>

<p>If you want an IDE, check the following (in alphabetical
order, not order of preference):</p>

<p>Eclipse http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/</p>

<p>The Eclipse Perl Integration Project integrates Perl
editing/debugging with Eclipse.</p>

<p>Enginsite http://www.enginsite.com/</p>

<p>Perl Editor by EngInSite is a complete integrated
development environment (IDE) for creating, testing, and
debugging Perl scripts; the tool runs on Windows
9x/NT/2000/XP or later.</p>

<p>Komodo http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo/</p>

<p>ActiveStates cross-platform (as of October 2004, thats
Windows, Linux, and Solaris), multi-language IDE has Perl
support, including a regular expression debugger and remote
debugging.</p>

<p>Open Perl IDE http://open-perl-ide.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>Open Perl IDE is an integrated development environment
for writing and debugging Perl scripts with ActiveState s
ActivePerl distribution under Windows 95/98/NT/2000.</p>

<p>OptiPerl http://www.optiperl.com/</p>

<p>OptiPerl is a Windows IDE with simulated CGI
environment, including debugger and syntax highlighting
editor.</p>

<p>Padre http://padre.perlide.org/</p>

<p>Padre is cross-platform IDE for Perl written in Perl
using the the wxWidgets to provide a native look and feel.
Its open source under the Artistic License.</p>

<p>PerlBuilder http://www.solutionsoft.com/perl.htm</p>

<p>PerlBuilder is an integrated development environment for
Windows that supports Perl development.</p>

<p>visiPerl+ http://helpconsulting.net/visiperl/</p>

<p>From Help Consulting, for Windows.</p>

<p>Visual Perl
http://www.activestate.com/Products/Visual_Perl/</p>

<p>Visual Perl is a Visual Studio.NET plug-in from
ActiveState.</p>

<p>Zeus http://www.zeusedit.com/lookmain.html</p>

<p>Zeus for Window is another Win32 multi-language
editor/IDE that comes with support for Perl:</p>

<p>For editors: if youre on Unix you probably have vi or a
vi clone already, and possibly an emacs too, so you may not
need to download anything. In any emacs the cperl-mode (M-x
cperl-mode) gives you perhaps the best available Perl
editing mode in any editor.</p>

<p>If you are using Windows, you can use any editor that
lets you work with plain text, such as NotePad or WordPad.
Word processors, such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect,
typically do not work since they insert all sorts of
behind-the-scenes information, although some allow you to
save files as &quot;Text Only&quot;. You can also download
text editors designed specifically for programming, such as
Textpad ( http://www.textpad.com/ ) and UltraEdit (
http://www.ultraedit.com/ ), among others.</p>

<p>If you are using MacOS, the same concerns apply. MacPerl
(for Classic environments) comes with a simple editor.
Popular external editors are BBEdit ( http://www.bbedit.com/
) or Alpha ( http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html ).
MacOS X users can use Unix editors as well.</p>

<p>GNU Emacs
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html</p>

<p>MicroEMACS http://www.microemacs.de/</p>

<p>XEmacs http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html</p>

<p>Jed http://space.mit.edu/~davis/jed/</p>

<p>or a vi clone such as</p>

<p>Elvis ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/elvis/
http://www.fh-wedel.de/elvis/</p>

<p>Vile http://dickey.his.com/vile/vile.html</p>

<p>Vim http://www.vim.org/</p>

<p>For vi lovers in general, Windows or elsewhere:</p>

<p>http://www.thomer.com/thomer/vi/vi.html</p>

<p>nvi ( http://www.bostic.com/vi/ , available from CPAN in
src/misc/) is yet another vi clone, unfortunately not
available for Windows, but in UNIX platforms you might be
interested in trying it out, firstly because strictly
speaking it is not a vi clone, it is the real vi, or the new
incarnation of it, and secondly because you can embed Perl
inside it to use Perl as the scripting language. nvi is not
alone in this, though: at least also vim and vile offer an
embedded Perl.</p>

<p>The following are Win32 multilanguage editor/IDEs that
support Perl:</p>

<p>Codewright http://www.borland.com/codewright/</p>

<p>MultiEdit http://www.MultiEdit.com/</p>

<p>SlickEdit http://www.slickedit.com/</p>

<p>ConTEXT http://www.contexteditor.org/</p>

<p>There is also a toyedit Text widget based editor written
in Perl that is distributed with the Tk module on CPAN. The
ptkdb ( http://ptkdb.sourceforge.net/ ) is a Perl/tk based
debugger that acts as a development environment of sorts.
Perl Composer ( http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/ ) is an
IDE for Perl/Tk GUI creation.</p>

<p>In addition to an editor/IDE you might be interested in
a more powerful shell environment for Win32. Your options
include</p>

<p>Bash from the Cygwin package (
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/ )</p>

<p>Ksh from the MKS Toolkit ( http://www.mkssoftware.com/
), or the Bourne shell of the U/WIN environment (
http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/ )</p>

<p>Tcsh ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/ , see also
http://www.primate.wisc.edu/software/csh-tcsh-book/</p>

<p>Zsh http://www.zsh.org/</p>

<p>MKS and U/WIN are commercial (U/WIN is free for
educational and research purposes), Cygwin is covered by the
GNU General Public License (but that shouldnt matter for
Perl use). The Cygwin, MKS, and U/WIN all contain (in
addition to the shells) a comprehensive set of standard UNIX
toolkit utilities.</p>

<p>If youre transferring text files between Unix and
Windows using FTP be sure to transfer them in ASCII mode so
the ends of lines are appropriately converted.</p>

<p>On Mac OS the MacPerl Application comes with a simple
32k text editor that behaves like a rudimentary IDE. In
contrast to the MacPerl Application the MPW Perl tool can
make use of the MPW Shell itself as an editor (with no 32k
limit).</p>

<p>Affrus is a full Perl development environment with full
debugger support ( http://www.latenightsw.com ).</p>

<p>Alpha is an editor, written and extensible in Tcl, that
nonetheless has built in support for several popular markup
and programming languages including Perl and HTML (
http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html ).</p>

<p>BBEdit and BBEdit Lite are text editors for Mac OS that
have a Perl sensitivity mode ( http://web.barebones.com/
).</p>

<p>Where can I get Perl macros for vi? For a complete
version of Tom Christiansen s vi configuration file, see
http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/toms.exrc.gz
, the standard benchmark file for vi emulators. The file
runs best with nvi, the current version of vi out of
Berkeley, which incidentally can be built with an embedded
Perl interpreter--see http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/ .</p>

<p>Where can I get perl-mode for emacs? Since Emacs version
19 patchlevel 22 or so, there have been both a perl-mode.el
and support for the Perl debugger built in. These should
come with the standard Emacs 19 distribution.</p>

<p>In the Perl source directory, you ll find a directory
called &quot;emacs&quot;, which contains a cperl-mode that
color-codes keywords, provides context-sensitive help, and
other nifty things.</p>

<p>Note that the perl-mode of emacs will have fits with
&quot;main&rsquo;foo&quot; (single quote), and mess up the
indentation and highlighting. You are probably using
&quot;main::foo&quot; in new Perl code anyway, so this
shouldn t be an issue.</p>

<p>How can I use curses with Perl? The Curses module from
CPAN provides a dynamically loadable object module interface
to a curses library. A small demo can be found at the
directory
http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/rep.gz
; this program repeats a command and updates the screen as
needed, rendering rep ps axu similar to top.</p>

<p>How can I write a GUI (X, Tk, Gtk, etc.) in Perl?
(contributed by Ben Morrow)</p>

<p>There are a number of modules which let you write GUIs
in Perl. Most GUI toolkits have a perl interface: an
incomplete list follows.</p>

<p>Tk This works under Unix and Windows, and the current
version doesnt look half as bad under Windows as it used to.
Some of the gui elements still dont feel quite right,
though. The interface is very natural and perlish, making it
easy to use in small scripts that just need a simple gui. It
hasnt been updated in a while.</p>

<p>Wx This is a Perl binding for the cross-platform
wxWidgets toolkit ( http://www.wxwidgets.org ). It works
under Unix, Win32 and Mac OS X, using native widgets (Gtk
under Unix). The interface follows the C++ interface
closely, but the documentation is a little sparse for
someone who doesn t know the library, mostly just referring
you to the C++ documentation.</p>

<p>Gtk and Gtk2 These are Perl bindings for the Gtk toolkit
( http://www.gtk.org ). The interface changed significantly
between versions 1 and 2 so they have separate Perl modules.
It runs under Unix, Win32 and Mac OS X (currently it
requires an X server on Mac OS, but a native port is
underway), and the widgets look the same on every plaform:
i.e., they dont match the native widgets. As with Wx, the
Perl bindings follow the C API closely, and the
documentation requires you to read the C documentation to
understand it.</p>

<p>Win32::GUI This provides access to most of the Win32 GUI
widgets from Perl. Obviously, it only runs under Win32, and
uses native widgets. The Perl interface doesnt really follow
the C interface: its been made more Perlish, and the
documentation is pretty good. More advanced stuff may
require familiarity with the C Win32 APIs, or reference to
MSDN.</p>

<p>CamelBones CamelBones (
http://camelbones.sourceforge.net ) is a Perl interface to
Mac OS Xs Cocoa GUI toolkit, and as such can be used to
produce native GUIs on Mac OS X. Its not on CPAN, as it
requires frameworks that CPAN.pm doesnt know how to install,
but installation is via the standard OSX package installer.
The Perl API is, again, very close to the ObjC API its
wrapping, and the documentation just tells you how to
translate from one to the other.</p>

<p>Qt There is a Perl interface to TrollTechs Qt toolkit,
but it does not appear to be maintained.</p>

<p>Athena Sx is an interface to the Athena widget set which
comes with X, but again it appears not to be much used
nowadays.</p>

<p>How can I make my Perl program run faster? The best way
to do this is to come up with a better algorithm. This can
often make a dramatic difference. Jon Bentley s book
Programming Pearls (that s not a misspelling!) has some good
tips on optimization, too. Advice on benchmarking boils down
to: benchmark and profile to make sure youre optimizing the
right part, look for better algorithms instead of
microtuning your code, and when all else fails consider just
buying faster hardware. You will probably want to read the
answer to the earlier question &quot;How do I profile my
Perl programs?&quot; if you havent done so already.</p>

<p>A different approach is to autoload seldom-used Perl
code. See the AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in the
standard distribution for that. Or you could locate the
bottleneck and think about writing just that part in C, the
way we used to take bottlenecks in C code and write them in
assembler. Similar to rewriting in C, modules that have
critical sections can be written in C (for instance, the PDL
module from CPAN).</p>

<p>If you re currently linking your perl executable to a
shared libc.so, you can often gain a 10-25% performance
benefit by rebuilding it to link with a static libc.a
instead. This will make a bigger perl executable, but your
Perl programs (and programmers) may thank you for it. See
the INSTALL file in the source distribution for more
information.</p>

<p>The undump program was an ancient attempt to speed up
Perl program by storing the already-compiled form to disk.
This is no longer a viable option, as it only worked on a
few architectures, and wasn t a good solution anyway.</p>

<p>How can I make my Perl program take less memory? When it
comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always prefers to
throw memory at a problem. Scalars in Perl use more memory
than strings in C, arrays take more than that, and hashes
use even more. While theres still a lot to be done, recent
releases have been addressing these issues. For example, as
of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are shared amongst all hashes
using them, so require no reallocation.</p>

<p>In some cases, using substr() or vec() to simulate
arrays can be highly beneficial. For example, an array of a
thousand booleans will take at least 20,000 bytes of space,
but it can be turned into one 125-byte bit vector--a
considerable memory savings. The standard Tie::SubstrHash
module can also help for certain types of data structure. If
youre working with specialist data structures (matrices, for
instance) modules that implement these in C may use less
memory than equivalent Perl modules.</p>

<p>Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was
compiled with the system malloc or with Perls builtin
malloc. Whichever one it is, try using the other one and see
whether this makes a difference. Information about malloc is
in the INSTALL file in the source distribution. You can find
out whether you are using perl s malloc by typing &quot;perl
-V:usemymalloc&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, the best way to save memory is to not do
anything to waste it in the first place. Good programming
practices can go a long way toward this:</p>

<p>&middot; Dont slurp!</p>

<p>Don t read an entire file into memory if you can process
it line by line. Or more concretely, use a loop like
this:</p>

<p># # Good Idea # while (&lt;FILE&gt;) { # ... }</p>

<p>instead of this:</p>

<p># # Bad Idea # @data = &lt;FILE&gt;; foreach (@data) { #
... }</p>

<p>When the files youre processing are small, it doesn t
much matter which way you do it, but it makes a huge
difference when they start getting larger.</p>

<p>&middot; Use map and grep selectively</p>

<p>Remember that both map and grep expect a LIST argument,
so doing this:</p>

<p>@wanted = grep {/pattern/} &lt;FILE&gt;;</p>

<p>will cause the entire file to be slurped. For large
files, its better to loop:</p>

<p>while (&lt;FILE&gt;) { push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
}</p>

<p>&middot; Avoid unnecessary quotes and
stringification</p>

<p>Dont quote large strings unless absolutely
necessary:</p>

<p>my $copy = &quot;$large_string&quot;;</p>

<p>makes 2 copies of $large_string (one for $copy and
another for the quotes), whereas</p>

<p>my $copy = $large_string;</p>

<p>only makes one copy.</p>

<p>Ditto for stringifying large arrays:</p>

<p>{ local $, = &quot;0; print @big_array; }</p>

<p>is much more memory-efficient than either</p>

<p>print join &quot;0, @big_array;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>{ local $&quot; = &quot;0; print &quot;@big_array&quot;;
}</p>

<p>&middot; Pass by reference</p>

<p>Pass arrays and hashes by reference, not by value. For
one thing, its the only way to pass multiple lists or hashes
(or both) in a single call/return. It also avoids creating a
copy of all the contents. This requires some judgement,
however, because any changes will be propagated back to the
original data. If you really want to mangle (er, modify) a
copy, you ll have to sacrifice the memory needed to make
one.</p>

<p>&middot; Tie large variables to disk.</p>

<p>For &quot;big&quot; data stores (i.e. ones that exceed
available memory) consider using one of the DB modules to
store it on disk instead of in RAM. This will incur a
penalty in access time, but thats probably better than
causing your hard disk to thrash due to massive
swapping.</p>

<p>Is it safe to return a reference to local or lexical
data? Yes. Perls garbage collection system takes care of
this so everything works out right.</p>

<p>How can I free an array or hash so my program shrinks?
(contributed by Michael Carman)</p>

<p>You usually cant. Memory allocated to lexicals (i.e.
my() variables) cannot be reclaimed or reused even if they
go out of scope. It is reserved in case the variables come
back into scope. Memory allocated to global variables can be
reused (within your program) by using undef() and/or
delete().</p>

<p>On most operating systems, memory allocated to a program
can never be returned to the system. Thats why long-running
programs sometimes re- exec themselves. Some operating
systems (notably, systems that use mmap(2) for allocating
large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that is no longer
used, but on such systems, perl must be configured and
compiled to use the OSs malloc, not perls.</p>

<p>In general, memory allocation and de-allocation isnt
something you can or should be worrying about much in
Perl.</p>

<p>See also &quot;How can I make my Perl program take less
memory?&quot;</p>

<p>How can I make my CGI script more efficient? Beyond the
normal measures described to make general Perl programs
faster or smaller, a CGI program has additional issues. It
may be run several times per second. Given that each time it
runs it will need to be re-compiled and will often allocate
a megabyte or more of system memory, this can be a killer.
Compiling into C ist going to help you because the process
start-up overhead is where the bottleneck is.</p>

<p>There are two popular ways to avoid this overhead. One
solution involves running the Apache HTTP server (available
from http://www.apache.org/ ) with either of the mod_perl or
mod_fastcgi plugin modules.</p>

<p>With mod_perl and the Apache::Registry module
(distributed with mod_perl), httpd will run with an embedded
Perl interpreter which pre- compiles your script and then
executes it within the same address space without forking.
The Apache extension also gives Perl access to the internal
server API, so modules written in Perl can do just about
anything a module written in C can. For more on mod_perl,
see http://perl.apache.org/</p>

<p>With the FCGI module (from CPAN) and the mod_fastcgi
module (available from http://www.fastcgi.com/ ) each of
your Perl programs becomes a permanent CGI daemon
process.</p>

<p>Both of these solutions can have far-reaching effects on
your system and on the way you write your CGI programs, so
investigate them with care.</p>

<p>See
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/
.</p>

<p>How can I hide the source for my Perl program? Delete
it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly
unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of
&quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p>First of all, however, you cant take away read
permission, because the source code has to be readable in
order to be compiled and interpreted. (That doesnt mean that
a CGI scripts source is readable by people on the web,
though--only by people with access to the filesystem.) So
you have to leave the permissions at the socially friendly
0755 level.</p>

<p>Some people regard this as a security problem. If your
program does insecure things and relies on people not
knowing how to exploit those insecurities, it is not secure.
It is often possible for someone to determine the insecure
things and exploit them without viewing the source. Security
through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of
fixing them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p>You can try using encryption via source filters
(Starting from Perl 5.8 the Filter::Simple and
Filter::Util::Call modules are included in the standard
distribution), but any decent programmer will be able to
decrypt it. You can try using the byte code compiler and
interpreter described later in perlfaq3, but the curious
might still be able to de- compile it. You can try using the
native-code compiler described later, but crackers might be
able to disassemble it. These pose varying degrees of
difficulty to people wanting to get at your code, but none
can definitively conceal it (true of every language, not
just Perl).</p>

<p>It is very easy to recover the source of Perl programs.
You simply feed the program to the perl interpreter and use
the modules in the B:: hierarchy. The B::Deparse module
should be able to defeat most attempts to hide source.
Again, this is not unique to Perl.</p>

<p>If youre concerned about people profiting from your
code, then the bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive
license will give you legal security. License your software
and pepper it with threatening statements like &quot;This is
unpublished proprietary software of XYZ Corp. Your access to
it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see
a lawyer if you want to be sure your licenses wording will
stand up in court.</p>

<p>How can I compile my Perl program into byte code or C?
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>In general, you cant do this. There are some things that
may work for your situation though. People usually ask this
question because they want to distribute their works without
giving away the source code, and most solutions trade disk
space for convenience. You probably wont see much of a speed
increase either, since most solutions simply bundle a Perl
interpreter in the final product (but see &quot;How can I
make my Perl program run faster?&quot;).</p>

<p>The Perl Archive Toolkit ( http://par.perl.org/ ) is
Perls analog to Javas JAR. Its freely available and on CPAN
( http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR/ ).</p>

<p>There are also some commercial products that may work
for you, although you have to buy a license for them.</p>

<p>The Perl Dev Kit (
http://www.activestate.com/Products/Perl_Dev_Kit/ ) from
ActiveState can &quot;Turn your Perl programs into
ready-to-run executables for HP-UX, Linux, Solaris and
Windows.&quot;</p>

<p>Perl2Exe ( http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm ) is a
command line program for converting perl scripts to
executable files. It targets both Windows and unix
platforms.</p>

<p>How can I get &quot;#!perl&quot; to work on
[MS-DOS,NT,...]? For OS/2 just use</p>

<p>extproc perl -S -your_switches</p>

<p>as the first line in &quot;*.cmd&quot; file
(&quot;-S&quot; due to a bug in cmd.exes &quot;extproc&quot;
handling). For DOS one should first invent a corresponding
batch file and codify it in &quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot;
(see the dosish.h file in the source distribution for more
information).</p>

<p>The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState
port of Perl, will modify the Registry to associate the
&quot;.pl&quot; extension with the perl interpreter. If you
install another port, perhaps even building your own
Win95/NT Perl from the standard sources by using a Windows
port of gcc (e.g., with cygwin or mingw32), then you ll have
to modify the Registry yourself. In addition to associating
&quot;.pl&quot; with the interpreter, NT people can use:
&quot;SET PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.PL&quot; to let them run the
program &quot;install-linux.pl&quot; merely by typing
&quot;install-linux&quot;.</p>

<p>Under &quot;Classic&quot; MacOS, a perl program will
have the appropriate Creator and Type, so that
double-clicking them will invoke the MacPerl application.
Under Mac OS X, clickable apps can be made from any
&quot;#!&quot; script using Wil Sanchez DropScript utility:
http://www.wsanchez.net/software/ .</p>

<p>IMPORTANT!: Whatever you do, PLEASE dont get frustrated,
and just throw the perl interpreter into your cgi-bin
directory, in order to get your programs working for a web
server. This is an EXTREMELY big security risk. Take the
time to figure out how to do it correctly.</p>

<p>Can I write useful Perl programs on the command line?
Yes. Read perlrun for more information. Some examples
follow. (These assume standard Unix shell quoting
rules.)</p>

<p># sum first and last fields perl -lane &rsquo;print
$F[0] + $F[-1]&rsquo; *</p>

<p># identify text files perl -le &rsquo;for(@ARGV) {print
if -f &amp;&amp; -T _}&rsquo; *</p>

<p># remove (most) comments from C program perl -0777 -pe
&rsquo;s{/*?}{}gs&rsquo; foo.c</p>

<p># make file a month younger than today, defeating reaper
daemons perl -e &rsquo;$X=24*60*60; utime(time(),time() + 30
* $X,@ARGV)&rsquo; *</p>

<p># find first unused uid perl -le &rsquo;$i++ while
getpwuid($i); print $i&rsquo;</p>

<p># display reasonable manpath echo $PATH | perl -nl -072
-e &rsquo;
s![^/+]*$!man!&amp;&amp;-d&amp;&amp;!$s{$_}++&amp;&amp;push@m,$_;END{print&quot;@m&quot;}&rsquo;</p>

<p>OK, the last one was actually an Obfuscated Perl Contest
entry. :-)</p>

<p>Why dot Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system?
The problem is usually that the command interpreters on
those systems have rather different ideas about quoting than
the Unix shells under which the one-liners were created. On
some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double
ones, which you must NOT do on Unix or Plan9 systems. You
might also have to change a single % to a %%.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p># Unix (including Mac OS X) perl -e &rsquo;print
&quot;Hello world0&rsquo;</p>

<p># DOS, etc. perl -e &quot;print</p>

<p># Mac Classic print &quot;Hello world0 (then Run
&quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)</p>

<p># MPW perl -e &rsquo;print &quot;Hello world0&rsquo;</p>

<p># VMS perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello
world0&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is that none of these examples are reliable:
they depend on the command interpreter. Under Unix, the
first two often work. Under DOS, it s entirely possible that
neither works. If 4DOS was the command shell, youd probably
have better luck like this:</p>

<p>perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello
world0Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Under the Mac, it depends which environment you are
using. The MacPerl shell, or MPW, is much like Unix shells
in its support for several quoting variants, except that it
makes free use of the Mac s non-ASCII characters as control
characters.</p>

<p>Using qq(), q(), and qx(), instead of &quot;double
quotes&quot;, single quotes, and backticks, may make
one-liners easier to write.</p>

<p>There is no general solution to all of this. It is a
mess.</p>

Albanowski.]</p>

<p>Where can I learn about CGI or Web programming in Perl?
For modules, get the CGI or LWP modules from CPAN. For
textbooks, see the two especially dedicated to web stuff in
the question on books. For problems and questions related to
the web, like &quot;Why do I get 500 Errors&quot; or
&quot;Why doesnt it run from the browser right when it runs
fine on the command line&quot;, see the troubleshooting
guides and references in perlfaq9 or in the CGI MetaFAQ:</p>

<p>http://www.perl.org/CGI_MetaFAQ.html</p>

<p>Where can I learn about object-oriented Perl
programming? A good place to start is perltoot, and you can
use perlobj, perlboot, perltoot, perltooc, and perlbot for
reference.</p>

<p>A good book on OO on Perl is the &quot;Object-Oriented
Perl&quot; by Damian Conway from Manning Publications, or
&quot;Intermediate Perl&quot; by Randal Schwartz, brian d
foy, and Tom Phoenix from OReilly Media.</p>

<p>Where can I learn about linking C with Perl? If you want
to call C from Perl, start with perlxstut, moving on to
perlxs, xsubpp, and perlguts. If you want to call Perl from
C, then read perlembed, perlcall, and perlguts. Dont forget
that you can learn a lot from looking at how the authors of
existing extension modules wrote their code and solved their
problems.</p>

<p>You might not need all the power of XS. The Inline::C
module lets you put C code directly in your Perl source. It
handles all the magic to make it work. You still have to
learn at least some of the perl API but you wont have to
deal with the complexity of the XS support files.</p>

<p>Ive read perlembed, perlguts, etc., but I cat embed perl
in my C program; what am I doing wrong? Download the
ExtUtils::Embed kit from CPAN and run make test. If the
tests pass, read the pods again and again and again. If they
fail, see perlbug and send a bug report with the output of
&quot;make test TEST_VERBOSE=1&quot; along with &quot;perl
-V&quot;.</p>

<p>When I tried to run my script, I got this message. What
does it mean? A complete list of Perls error messages and
warnings with explanatory text can be found in perldiag. You
can also use the splain program (distributed with Perl) to
explain the error messages:</p>

<p>perl program 2&gt;diag.out splain [-v] [-p] diag.out</p>

<p>or change your program to explain the messages for
you:</p>

<p>use diagnostics;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>use diagnostics -verbose;</p>

<p>Whas MakeMaker? (contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p>The &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; module, better known
simply as &quot;MakeMaker&quot;, turns a Perl script,
typically called &quot;Makefile.PL&quot;, into a Makefile.
The unix tool &quot;make&quot; uses this file to manage
dependencies and actions to process and install a Perl
distribution.</p>
