<p>NAME perf-sched - Tool to trace/measure scheduler
properties (latencies)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf sched
{record|latency|map|replay|script}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION There are five variants of perf sched:</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched record &lt;command&gt;&acute; to
record the scheduling events of an arbitrary workload.</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched latency&acute; to report the per task
scheduling latencies and other scheduling properties of the
workload.</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched script&acute; to see a detailed trace
of the workload that was recorded (aliased to &acute;perf
script&acute; for now).</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched replay&acute; to simulate the workload
that was recorded via perf sched record. (this is done by
starting up mockup threads that mimic the workload based on
the events in the trace. These threads can then replay the
timings (CPU runtime and sleep patterns) of the workload as
it occurred when it was recorded - and can repeat it a
number of times, measuring its performance.)</p>

<p>&acute;perf sched map&acute; to print a textual
context-switching outline of workload captured via perf
sched record. Columns stand for individual CPUs, and the
two-letter shortcuts stand for tasks that are running on a
CPU. A &acute;*&acute; denotes the CPU that had the event,
and a dot signals an idle CPU.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -i, --input=&lt;file&gt; Input file name.
(default: perf.data unless stdin is a fifo)</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Be more verbose. (show symbol address,
etc)</p>

<p>-D, --dump-raw-trace= Display verbose dump of the sched
data.</p>
