<p>PORTRESERVE(1) TCP port reservation utility
PORTRESERVE(1)</p>

<p>NAME portreserve - reserve ports to prevent portmap
mapping them</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS portreserve</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The portreserve program aims to help
services with well-known ports that lie in the bindresvport
range. It prevents portmap (or other programs using
bindresvport) from occupying a real service&acute;s port by
occupying it itself, until the real service tells it to
release the port (generally in its init script).</p>

<p>It is intended that portreserve runs from an initscript
of its own, and services wishing to interact with it should
use portrelease.</p>

<p>When the portreserve daemon is started, it examines the
/etc/portreserve/ directory. Each file not containing . or ~
in its name is considered to be a service configuration
file, and must contain a service name (as listed in
/etc/services) or a port number. UDP services may be
specified by appending &quot;/udp&quot; to the service name,
and TCP services by &quot;/tcp&quot;. Several services may
be specified, one per line.</p>

<p>For example, /etc/portreserve/cups might contain the
string ipp or, equivalently, ipp/tcp and ipp/udp on separate
lines.</p>

<p>For each service configuration file, a socket is created
and bound to the appropriate port. A service wishing to bind
to its port must first run portrelease, which instructs
portreserve to release the port associated with the
service.</p>

<p>Once all the reserved ports have been released, the
daemon exits.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/portreserve/* Service configuration files</p>

<p>/var/run/portreserve/socket communication socket for
portrelease</p>
