<p>DESCRIPTION Tcl uses a two-layered channel architecture.
It provides a generic upper layer to enable C and Tcl
programs to perform input and output using the same APIs for
a variety of files, devices, sockets etc. The generic C APIs
are described in the manual entry for Tcl_OpenFileChan-
nel.</p>

<p>The lower layer provides type-specific channel drivers
for each type of device supported on each platform. This
manual entry describes the C APIs used to communicate
between the generic layer and the type-spe- cific channel
drivers. It also explains how new types of channels can be
added by providing new channel drivers.</p>

<p>Channel drivers consist of a number of components:
First, each channel driver provides a Tcl_ChannelType
structure containing pointers to functions implementing the
various operations used by the generic layer to communicate
with the channel driver. The Tcl_ChannelType structure and
the functions referenced by it are described in the section
TCL_CHANNELTYPE, below.</p>

<p>Second, channel drivers usually provide a Tcl command to
create instances of that type of channel. For example, the
Tcl open command creates channels that use the file and
command channel drivers, and the Tcl socket command creates
channels that use TCP sockets for network communication.</p>

<p>Third, a channel driver optionally provides a C function
to open chan- nel instances of that type. For example,
Tcl_OpenFileChannel opens a channel that uses the file
channel driver, and Tcl_OpenTcpClient opens a channel that
uses the TCP network protocol. These creation functions
typically use Tcl_CreateChannel internally to open the
channel.</p>

<p>To add a new type of channel you must implement a C API
or a Tcl com- mand that opens a channel by invoking
Tcl_CreateChannel. When your driver calls Tcl_CreateChannel
it passes in a Tcl_ChannelType structure describing the
drivers I/O procedures. The generic layer will then invoke
the functions referenced in that structure to perform
operations on the channel.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateChannel opens a new channel and associates the
supplied type- Ptr and instanceData with it. The channel is
opened in the mode indi- cated by mask. For a discussion of
channel drivers, their operations and the Tcl_ChannelType
structure, see the section TCL_CHANNELTYPE, below.</p>

<p>Tcl_CreateChannel interacts with the code managing the
standard chan- nels. Once a standard channel was initialized
either through a call to Tcl_GetStdChannel or a call to
Tcl_SetStdChannel closing this standard channel will cause
the next call to Tcl_CreateChannel to make the new channel
the new standard channel too. See Tcl_StandardChannels for a
general treatise about standard channels and the behaviour
of the Tcl library with regard to them.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelInstanceData returns the instance data
associated with the channel in channel. This is the same as
the instanceData argument in the call to Tcl_CreateChannel
that created this channel.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelType returns a pointer to the
Tcl_ChannelType structure used by the channel in the channel
argument. This is the same as the typePtr argument in the
call to Tcl_CreateChannel that created this channel.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelName returns a string containing the name
associated with the channel, or NULL if the channelName
argument to Tcl_CreateChannel was NULL.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelHandle places the OS-specific device
handle associated with channel for the given direction in
the location specified by han- dlePtr and returns TCL_OK. If
the channel does not have a device han- dle for the
specified direction, then TCL_ERROR is returned instead.
Different channel drivers will return different types of
handle. Refer to the manual entries for each driver to
determine what type of handle is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelThread returns the id of the thread
currently managing the specified channel. This allows
channel drivers to send their file events to the correct
event queue even for a multi-threaded core.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelMode returns an OR-ed combination of
TCL_READABLE and TCL_WRITABLE, indicating whether the
channel is open for input and out- put.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetChannelBufferSize returns the size, in bytes, of
buffers allo- cated to store input or output in channel. If
the value was not set by a previous call to
Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize, described below, then the default
value of 4096 is returned.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize sets the size, in bytes, of
buffers that will be allocated in subsequent operations on
the channel to store input or output. The size argument
should be between ten and one million, allow- ing buffers of
ten bytes to one million bytes. If size is outside this
range, Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize sets the buffer size to
4096.</p>

<p>Tcl_NotifyChannel is called by a channel driver to
indicate to the generic layer that the events specified by
mask have occurred on the channel. Channel drivers are
responsible for invoking this function whenever the channel
handlers need to be called for the channel. See WATCHPROC
below for more details.</p>

<p>Tcl_BadChannelOption is called from driver specific
setOptionProc or getOptionProc to generate a complete error
message.</p>

<p>Tcl_ChannelBuffered returns the number of bytes of input
currently buffered in the internal buffer (push back area)
of the channel itself. It does not report about the data in
the overall buffers for the stack of channels the supplied
channel is part of.</p>

<p>Tcl_IsChannelShared checks the refcount of the specified
channel and returns whether the channel was shared among
multiple interpreters (result == 1) or not (result ==
0).</p>

<p>Tcl_IsChannelRegistered checks whether the specified
channel is regis- tered in the given interpreter (result ==
1) or not (result == 0).</p>

<p>Tcl_IsChannelExisting checks whether a channel with the
specified name is registered in the (thread)-global list of
all channels (result == 1) or not (result == 0).</p>

<p>Tcl_CutChannel removes the specified channel from the
(thread)global list of all channels (of the current thread).
Application to a channel still registered in some
interpreter is not allowed. Also notifies the driver if the
Tcl_ChannelType version is TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4 (or
higher), and Tcl_DriverThreadActionProc is defined for
it.</p>

<p>Tcl_SpliceChannel adds the specified channel to the
(thread)global list of all channels (of the current thread).
Application to a channel registered in some interpreter is
not allowed. Also notifies the driver if the Tcl_ChannelType
version is TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4 (or higher), and
Tcl_DriverThreadActionProc is defined for it.</p>

<p>Tcl_ClearChannelHandlers removes all channelhandlers and
event scripts associated with the specified channel, thus
shutting down all event processing for this channel.</p>

<p>TCL_CHANNELTYPE A channel driver provides a
Tcl_ChannelType structure that contains pointers to
functions that implement the various operations on a chan-
nel; these operations are invoked as needed by the generic
layer. The structure was versioned starting in Tcl 8.3.2/8.4
to correct a problem with stacked channel drivers. See the
OLD CHANNEL TYPES section below for details about the old
structure.</p>

<p>The Tcl_ChannelType structure contains the following
fields: typedef struct Tcl_ChannelType { char *typeName;
Tcl_ChannelTypeVersion version; Tcl_DriverCloseProc
*closeProc; Tcl_DriverInputProc *inputProc;
Tcl_DriverOutputProc *outputProc; Tcl_DriverSeekProc
*seekProc; Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc *setOptionProc;
Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc *getOptionProc; Tcl_DriverWatchProc
*watchProc; Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc *getHandleProc;
Tcl_DriverClose2Proc *close2Proc; Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc
*blockModeProc; Tcl_DriverFlushProc *flushProc;
Tcl_DriverHandlerProc *handlerProc; Tcl_DriverWideSeekProc
*wideSeekProc; Tcl_DriverThreadActionProc *threadActionProc;
Tcl_DriverTruncateProc *truncateProc; } Tcl_ChannelType;</p>

<p>It is not necessary to provide implementations for all
channel opera- tions. Those which are not necessary may be
set to NULL in the struct: blockModeProc, seekProc,
setOptionProc, getOptionProc, and close2Proc, in addition to
flushProc, handlerProc, threadActionProc, and trun-
cateProc. Other functions that cannot be implemented in a
meaningful way should return EINVAL when called, to indicate
that the operations they represent are not available. Also
note that wideSeekProc can be NULL if seekProc is.</p>

<p>The user should only use the above structure for
Tcl_ChannelType instantiation. When referencing fields in a
Tcl_ChannelType structure, the following functions should be
used to obtain the values: Tcl_Chan- nelName,
Tcl_ChannelVersion, Tcl_ChannelBlockModeProc, Tcl_Channel-
CloseProc, Tcl_ChannelClose2Proc, Tcl_ChannelInputProc,
Tcl_ChannelOut- putProc, Tcl_ChannelSeekProc,
Tcl_ChannelWideSeekProc, Tcl_Chan- nelThreadActionProc,
Tcl_ChannelTruncateProc, Tcl_ChannelSetOptionProc,
Tcl_ChannelGetOptionProc, Tcl_ChannelWatchProc,
Tcl_ChannelGetH- andleProc, Tcl_ChannelFlushProc, or
Tcl_ChannelHandlerProc.</p>

<p>The change to the structures was made in such a way that
standard chan- nel types are binary compatible. However,
channel types that use stacked channels (i.e. TLS, Trf) have
new versions to correspond to the above change since the
previous code for stacked channels had problems.</p>

<p>TYPENAME The typeName field contains a null-terminated
string that identifies the type of the device implemented by
this driver, e.g. file or socket.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with Tcl_ChannelName, which
returns a pointer to the string.</p>

<p>VERSION The version field should be set to the version
of the structure that you require. TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2 is
the minimum recommended. TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_3 must be set
to specifiy the wideSeekProc member. TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4
must be set to specifiy the threadActionProc mem- ber
(includes wideSeekProc). TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_5 must be set
to specifiy the truncateProc members (includes wideSeekProc
and threadAc- tionProc). If it is not set to any of these,
then this Tcl_ChannelType is assumed to have the original
structure. See OLD CHANNEL TYPES for more details. While Tcl
will recognize and function with either struc- tures,
stacked channels must be of at least TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2
to function correctly.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with Tcl_ChannelVersion,
which returns one of TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_5,
TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_4, TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_3,
TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2 or TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_1.</p>

<p>BLOCKMODEPROC The blockModeProc field contains the
address of a function called by the generic layer to set
blocking and nonblocking mode on the device. BlockModeProc
should match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc( ClientData
instanceData, int mode);</p>

<p>The instanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when this channel was created. The mode
argument is either TCL_MODE_BLOCKING or TCL_MODE_NONBLOCKING
to set the device into block- ing or nonblocking mode. The
function should return zero if the opera- tion was
successful, or a nonzero POSIX error code if the operation
failed.</p>

<p>If the operation is successful, the function can modify
the supplied instanceData to record that the channel entered
blocking or nonblocking mode and to implement the blocking
or nonblocking behavior. For some device types, the blocking
and nonblocking behavior can be implemented by the
underlying operating system; for other device types, the
behav- ior must be emulated in the channel driver.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with
Tcl_ChannelBlockModeProc, which returns a pointer to the
function.</p>

<p>A channel driver not supplying a blockModeProc has to be
very, very careful. It has to tell the generic layer exactly
which blocking mode is acceptable to it, and should this
also document for the user so that the blocking mode of the
channel is not changed to an inacceptable value. Any
confusion here may lead the interpreter into a (spurious and
difficult to find) deadlock.</p>

<p>CLOSEPROC AND CLOSE2PROC The closeProc field contains
the address of a function called by the generic layer to
clean up driver-related information when the channel is
closed. CloseProc must match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverCloseProc( ClientData
instanceData, Tcl_Interp *interp);</p>

<p>The instanceData argument is the same as the value
provided to Tcl_Cre- ateChannel when the channel was
created. The function should release any storage maintained
by the channel driver for this channel, and close the input
and output devices encapsulated by this channel. All queued
output will have been flushed to the device before this
function is called, and no further driver operations will be
invoked on this instance after calling the closeProc. If the
close operation is suc- cessful, the procedure should return
zero; otherwise it should return a nonzero POSIX error code.
In addition, if an error occurs and interp is not NULL, the
procedure should store an error message in the inter-
preters result.</p>

<p>Alternatively, channels that support closing the read
and write sides independently may set closeProc to
TCL_CLOSE2PROC and set close2Proc to the address of a
function that matches the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverClose2Proc( ClientData
instanceData, Tcl_Interp *interp, int flags);</p>

<p>The close2Proc will be called with flags set to an OR ed
combination of TCL_CLOSE_READ or TCL_CLOSE_WRITE to indicate
that the driver should close the read and/or write side of
the channel. The channel driver may be invoked to perform
additional operations on the channel after close2Proc is
called to close one or both sides of the channel. If flags
is 0 (zero), the driver should close the channel in the
manner described above for closeProc. No further operations
will be invoked on this instance after close2Proc is called
with all flags cleared. In all cases, the close2Proc
function should return zero if the close operation was
successful; otherwise it should return a nonzero POSIX error
code. In addition, if an error occurs and interp is not
NULL, the procedure should store an error message in the
interpreter s result.</p>

<p>The closeProc and close2Proc values can be retrieved
with Tcl_Channel- CloseProc or Tcl_ChannelClose2Proc, which
return a pointer to the respective function.</p>

<p>INPUTPROC The inputProc field contains the address of a
function called by the generic layer to read data from the
file or device and store it in an internal buffer. InputProc
must match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverInputProc( ClientData
instanceData, char *buf, int bufSize, int
*errorCodePtr);</p>

<p>InstanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when the channel was created. The buf
argument points to an array of bytes in which to store input
from the device, and the bufSize argument indi- cates how
many bytes are available at buf.</p>

<p>The errorCodePtr argument points to an integer variable
provided by the generic layer. If an error occurs, the
function should set the variable to a POSIX error code that
identifies the error that occurred.</p>

<p>The function should read data from the input device
encapsulated by the channel and store it at buf. On success,
the function should return a nonnegative integer indicating
how many bytes were read from the input device and stored at
buf. On error, the function should return -1. If an error
occurs after some data has been read from the device, that
data is lost.</p>

<p>If inputProc can determine that the input device has
some data avail- able but less than requested by the bufSize
argument, the function should only attempt to read as much
data as is available and return without blocking. If the
input device has no data available whatsoever and the
channel is in nonblocking mode, the function should return
an EAGAIN error. If the input device has no data available
whatsoever and the channel is in blocking mode, the function
should block for the shortest possible time until at least
one byte of data can be read from the device; then, it
should return as much data as it can read without
blocking.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with Tcl_ChannelInputProc,
which returns a pointer to the function.</p>

<p>OUTPUTPROC The outputProc field contains the address of
a function called by the generic layer to transfer data from
an internal buffer to the output device. OutputProc must
match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverOutputProc( ClientData
instanceData, const char *buf, int toWrite, int
*errorCodePtr);</p>

<p>InstanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when the channel was created. The buf
argument contains an array of bytes to be written to the
device, and the toWrite argument indicates how many bytes
are to be written from the buf argument.</p>

<p>The errorCodePtr argument points to an integer variable
provided by the generic layer. If an error occurs, the
function should set this vari- able to a POSIX error code
that identifies the error.</p>

<p>The function should write the data at buf to the output
device encapsu- lated by the channel. On success, the
function should return a nonnega- tive integer indicating
how many bytes were written to the output device. The return
value is normally the same as toWrite, but may be less in
some cases such as if the output operation is interrupted by
a signal. If an error occurs the function should return -1.
In case of error, some data may have been written to the
device.</p>

<p>If the channel is nonblocking and the output device is
unable to absorb any data whatsoever, the function should
return -1 with an EAGAIN error without writing any data.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with Tcl_ChannelOutputProc,
which returns a pointer to the function.</p>

<p>SEEKPROC AND WIDESEEKPROC The seekProc field contains
the address of a function called by the generic layer to
move the access point at which subsequent input or output
operations will be applied. SeekProc must match the
following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverSeekProc( ClientData instanceData,
long offset, int seekMode, int *errorCodePtr);</p>

<p>The instanceData argument is the same as the value given
to Tcl_Create- Channel when this channel was created. Offset
and seekMode have the same meaning as for the Tcl_Seek
procedure (described in the manual entry for
Tcl_OpenFileChannel).</p>

<p>The errorCodePtr argument points to an integer variable
provided by the generic layer for returning errno values
from the function. The func- tion should set this variable
to a POSIX error code if an error occurs. The function
should store an EINVAL error code if the channel type does
not implement seeking.</p>

<p>The return value is the new access point or -1 in case
of error. If an error occurred, the function should not move
the access point.</p>

<p>If there is a non-NULL seekProc field, the wideSeekProc
field may con- tain the address of an alternative function
to use which handles wide (i.e. larger than 32-bit) offsets,
so allowing seeks within files larger than 2GB. The
wideSeekProc will be called in preference to the seekProc,
but both must be defined if the wideSeekProc is defined.
WideSeekProc must match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef Tcl_WideInt Tcl_DriverWideSeekProc( ClientData
instanceData, Tcl_WideInt offset, int seekMode, int
*errorCodePtr);</p>

<p>The arguments and return values mean the same thing as
with seekProc above, except that the type of offsets and the
return type are differ- ent.</p>

<p>The seekProc value can be retrieved with
Tcl_ChannelSeekProc, which returns a pointer to the
function, and similarly the wideSeekProc can be retrieved
with Tcl_ChannelWideSeekProc.</p>

<p>SETOPTIONPROC The setOptionProc field contains the
address of a function called by the generic layer to set a
channel type specific option on a channel. setOptionProc
must match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc( ClientData
instanceData, Tcl_Interp *interp, const char *optionName,
const char *newValue);</p>

<p>optionName is the name of an option to set, and newValue
is the new value for that option, as a string. The
instanceData is the same as the value given to
Tcl_CreateChannel when this channel was created. The
function should do whatever channel type specific action is
required to implement the new value of the option.</p>

<p>Some options are handled by the generic code and this
function is never called to set them, e.g. -blockmode. Other
options are specific to each channel type and the
setOptionProc procedure of the channel driver will get
called to implement them. The setOptionProc field can be
NULL, which indicates that this channel type supports no
type specific options.</p>

<p>If the option value is successfully modified to the new
value, the function returns TCL_OK. It should call
Tcl_BadChannelOption which itself returns TCL_ERROR if the
optionName is unrecognized. If new- Value specifies a value
for the option that is not supported or if a system call
error occurs, the function should leave an error message in
the result field of interp if interp is not NULL. The
function should also call Tcl_SetErrno to store an
appropriate POSIX error code.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with
Tcl_ChannelSetOptionProc, which returns a pointer to the
function.</p>

<p>GETOPTIONPROC The getOptionProc field contains the
address of a function called by the generic layer to get the
value of a channel type specific option on a channel.
getOptionProc must match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc( ClientData
instanceData, Tcl_Interp *interp, const char *optionName,
Tcl_DString *optionValue);</p>

<p>OptionName is the name of an option supported by this
type of channel. If the option name is not NULL, the
function stores its current value, as a string, in the Tcl
dynamic string optionValue. If optionName is NULL, the
function stores in optionValue an alternating list of all
supported options and their current values. On success, the
function returns TCL_OK. It should call Tcl_BadChannelOption
which itself returns TCL_ERROR if the optionName is
unrecognized. If a system call error occurs, the function
should leave an error message in the result of interp if
interp is not NULL. The function should also call
Tcl_SetErrno to store an appropriate POSIX error code.</p>

<p>Some options are handled by the generic code and this
function is never called to retrieve their value, e.g.
-blockmode. Other options are spe- cific to each channel
type and the getOptionProc procedure of the chan- nel driver
will get called to implement them. The getOptionProc field
can be NULL, which indicates that this channel type supports
no type specific options.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with
Tcl_ChannelGetOptionProc, which returns a pointer to the
function.</p>

<p>WATCHPROC The watchProc field contains the address of a
function called by the generic layer to initialize the event
notification mechanism to notice events of interest on this
channel. WatchProc should match the follow- ing
prototype:</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_DriverWatchProc( ClientData
instanceData, int mask);</p>

<p>The instanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when this channel was created. The mask
argument is an OR-ed combina- tion of TCL_READABLE,
TCL_WRITABLE and TCL_EXCEPTION; it indicates events the
caller is interested in noticing on this channel.</p>

<p>The function should initialize device type specific
mechanisms to notice when an event of interest is present on
the channel. When one or more of the designated events
occurs on the channel, the channel driver is responsible for
calling Tcl_NotifyChannel to inform the generic channel
module. The driver should take care not to starve other
channel drivers or sources of callbacks by invoking
Tcl_Notify- Channel too frequently. Fairness can be insured
by using the Tcl event queue to allow the channel event to
be scheduled in sequence with other events. See the
description of Tcl_QueueEvent for details on how to queue an
event.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with Tcl_ChannelWatchProc,
which returns a pointer to the function.</p>

<p>GETHANDLEPROC The getHandleProc field contains the
address of a function called by the generic layer to
retrieve a device-specific handle from the chan- nel.
GetHandleProc should match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc( ClientData
instanceData, int direction, ClientData *handlePtr);</p>

<p>InstanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when this channel was created. The
direction argument is either TCL_READABLE to retrieve the
handle used for input, or TCL_WRITABLE to retrieve the
handle used for output.</p>

<p>If the channel implementation has device-specific
handles, the function should retrieve the appropriate handle
associated with the channel, according the direction
argument. The handle should be stored in the location
referred to by handlePtr, and TCL_OK should be returned. If
the channel is not open for the specified direction, or if
the channel implementation does not use device handles, the
function should return TCL_ERROR.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with
Tcl_ChannelGetHandleProc, which returns a pointer to the
function.</p>

<p>FLUSHPROC The flushProc field is currently reserved for
future use. It should be set to NULL. FlushProc should match
the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverFlushProc( ClientData
instanceData);</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with Tcl_ChannelFlushProc,
which returns a pointer to the function.</p>

<p>HANDLERPROC The handlerProc field contains the address
of a function called by the generic layer to notify the
channel that an event occurred. It should be defined for
stacked channel drivers that wish to be notified of events
that occur on the underlying (stacked) channel. HandlerProc
should match the following prototype:</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverHandlerProc( ClientData
instanceData, int interestMask);</p>

<p>InstanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when this channel was created. The
interestMask is an OR-ed combination of TCL_READABLE or
TCL_WRITABLE; it indicates what type of event occurred on
this channel.</p>

<p>This value can be retrieved with Tcl_ChannelHandlerProc,
which returns a pointer to the function.</p>

<p>THREADACTIONPROC The threadActionProc field contains the
address of the function called by the generic layer when a
channel is created, closed, or going to move to a different
thread, i.e. whenever thread-specific driver state might
have to initialized or updated. It can be NULL. The action
TCL_CHANNEL_THREAD_REMOVE is used to notify the driver that
it should update or remove any thread-specific data it might
be maintaining for the channel.</p>

<p>The action TCL_CHANNEL_THREAD_INSERT is used to notify
the driver that it should update or initialize any
thread-specific data it might be maintaining using the
calling thread as the associate. See Tcl_CutChan- nel and
Tcl_SpliceChannel for more detail.</p>

<p>typedef void Tcl_DriverThreadActionProc( ClientData
instanceData, int action);</p>

<p>InstanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when this channel was created.</p>

<p>These values can be retrieved with
Tcl_ChannelThreadActionProc, which returns a pointer to the
function.</p>

<p>TRUNCATEPROC The truncateProc field contains the address
of the function called by the generic layer when a channel
is truncated to some length. It can be NULL.</p>

<p>typedef int Tcl_DriverTruncateProc( ClientData
instanceData, Tcl_WideInt length);</p>

<p>InstanceData is the same as the value passed to
Tcl_CreateChannel when this channel was created, and length
is the new length of the underly- ing file, which should not
be negative. The result should be 0 on suc- cess or an errno
code (suitable for use with Tcl_SetErrno) on failure.</p>

<p>These values can be retrieved with
Tcl_ChannelTruncateProc, which returns a pointer to the
function.</p>

<p>TCL_BADCHANNELOPTION This procedure generates a bad
option error message in an (optional) interpreter. It is
used by channel drivers when an invalid Set/Get option is
requested. Its purpose is to concatenate the generic options
list to the specific ones and factorize the generic options
error mes- sage string.</p>

<p>It always returns TCL_ERROR</p>

<p>An error message is generated in interps result object
to indicate that a command was invoked with a bad option.
The message has the form bad option &quot;blah&quot;: should
be one of &lt;...generic options...&gt;+&lt;...specific
options...&gt; so you get for instance: bad option
&quot;-blah&quot;: should be one of -blocking, -buffering,
-buffersize, -eofchar, -translation, -peername, or -sockname
when called with optionList equal to peername sockname</p>

<p>blah is the optionName argument and &lt;specific
options&gt; is a space separated list of specific option
words. The function takes good care of inserting minus signs
before each option, commas after, and an or before the last
option.</p>

<p>OLD CHANNEL TYPES The original (8.3.1 and below)
Tcl_ChannelType structure contains the following fields:</p>

<p>typedef struct Tcl_ChannelType { char *typeName;
Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc *blockModeProc; Tcl_DriverCloseProc
*closeProc; Tcl_DriverInputProc *inputProc;
Tcl_DriverOutputProc *outputProc; Tcl_DriverSeekProc
*seekProc; Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc *setOptionProc;
Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc *getOptionProc; Tcl_DriverWatchProc
*watchProc; Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc *getHandleProc;
Tcl_DriverClose2Proc *close2Proc; } Tcl_ChannelType;</p>

<p>It is still possible to create channel with the above
structure. The internal channel code will determine the
version. It is imperative to use the new Tcl_ChannelType
structure if you are creating a stacked channel driver, due
to problems with the earlier stacked channel implementation
(in 8.2.0 to 8.3.1).</p>

<p>Prior to 8.4.0 (i.e. during the later releases of 8.3
and early part of the 8.4 development cycle) the
Tcl_ChannelType structure contained the following
fields:</p>

<p>typedef struct Tcl_ChannelType { char *typeName;
Tcl_ChannelTypeVersion version; Tcl_DriverCloseProc
*closeProc; Tcl_DriverInputProc *inputProc;
Tcl_DriverOutputProc *outputProc; Tcl_DriverSeekProc
*seekProc; Tcl_DriverSetOptionProc *setOptionProc;
Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc *getOptionProc; Tcl_DriverWatchProc
*watchProc; Tcl_DriverGetHandleProc *getHandleProc;
Tcl_DriverClose2Proc *close2Proc; Tcl_DriverBlockModeProc
*blockModeProc; Tcl_DriverFlushProc *flushProc;
Tcl_DriverHandlerProc *handlerProc; Tcl_DriverTruncateProc
*truncateProc; } Tcl_ChannelType;</p>

<p>When the above structure is registered as a channel
type, the version field should always be
TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2.</p>
