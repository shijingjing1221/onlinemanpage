<p>RENICE(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual RENICE(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME renice - set nice values of running processes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS renice -n increment [-g | -p | -u] ID ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The renice utility shall request that the
nice values (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 3.239, Nice Value) of one or more
running processes be changed. By default, the applica- ble
processes are specified by their process IDs. When a process
group is specified (see -g), the request shall apply to all
processes in the process group.</p>

<p>The nice value shall be bounded in an
implementation-defined manner. If the requested increment
would raise or lower the nice value of the executed utility
beyond implementation-defined limits, then the limit whose
value was exceeded shall be used.</p>

<p>When a user is reniced, the request applies to all
processes whose saved set-user-ID matches the user ID
corresponding to the user.</p>

<p>Regardless of which options are supplied or any other
factor, renice shall not alter the nice values of any
process unless the user request- ing such a change has
appropriate privileges to do so for the specified process.
If the user lacks appropriate privileges to perform the
requested action, the utility shall return an error
status.</p>

<p>The saved set-user-ID of the user s process shall be
checked instead of its effective user ID when renice
attempts to determine the user ID of the process in order to
determine whether the user has appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The renice utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-g Interpret all operands as unsigned decimal integer
process group IDs.</p>

<p>-n increment Specify how the nice value of the specified
process or processes is to be adjusted. The increment
option-argument is a positive or negative decimal integer
that shall be used to modify the nice value of the specified
process or processes.</p>

<p>Positive increment values shall cause a lower nice
value. Negative increment values may require appropriate
privileges and shall cause a higher nice value.</p>

<p>-p Interpret all operands as unsigned decimal integer
process IDs. The -p option is the default if no options are
specified.</p>

<p>-u Interpret all operands as users. If a user exists
with a user name equal to the operand, then the user ID of
that user is used in further processing. Otherwise, if the
operand represents an unsigned decimal integer, it shall be
used as the numeric user ID of the user.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p>ID A process ID, process group ID, or user name/user ID,
depending on the option selected.</p>

<p>STDIN Not used.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of renice:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in
arguments).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT Not used.</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 Successful completion.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE None.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES 1. Adjust the nice value so that process IDs
987 and 32 would have a lower nice value:</p>

<p>renice -n 5 -p 987 32</p>

<p>2. Adjust the nice value so that group IDs 324 and 76
would have a higher nice value, if the user has the
appropriate privileges to do so:</p>

<p>renice -n -4 -g 324 76</p>

<p>3. Adjust the nice value so that numeric user ID 8 and
user sas would have a lower nice value:</p>

<p>renice -n 4 -u 8 sas</p>

<p>Useful nice value increments on historical systems
include 19 or 20 (the affected processes run only when
nothing else in the system attempts to run) and any negative
number (to make processes run faster).</p>

<p>RATIONALE The gid, pid, and user specifications do not
fit either the definition of operand or option-argument.
However, for clarity, they have been included in the OPTIONS
section, rather than the OPERANDS section.</p>

<p>The definition of nice value is not intended to suggest
that all pro- cesses in a system have priorities that are
comparable. Scheduling policy extensions such as the
realtime priorities in the System Inter- faces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 make the notion of a single under-
lying priority for all scheduling policies problematic. Some
implemen- tations may implement the nice-related features to
affect all processes on the system, others to affect just
the general time-sharing activi- ties implied by this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, and others may have no effect at
all. Because of the use of
&quot;implementation-defined&quot; in nice and renice, a
wide range of implementation strategies are pos- sible.</p>

<p>Originally, this utility was written in the historical
manner, using the term &quot;nice value&quot;. This was
always a point of concern with users because it was never
intuitively obvious what this meant. With a newer version of
renice, which used the term &quot;system scheduling
priority&quot;, it was hoped that novice users could better
understand what this utility was meant to do. Also, it would
be easier to document what the utility was meant to do.
Unfortunately, the addition of the POSIX realtime scheduling
capabilities introduced the concepts of process and thread
scheduling priorities that were totally unaffected by the
nice/ renice utilities or the nice()/ setpriority()
functions. Continuing to use the term &quot;system
scheduling priority would have incorrectly suggested that
these utilities and functions were indeed affecting these
realtime priorities. It was decided to revert to the
historical term &quot;nice value&quot; to reference this
unrelated process attribute.</p>

<p>Although this utility has use by system administrators
(and in fact appears in the system administration portion of
the BSD documentation), the standard developers considered
that it was very useful for individ- ual end users to
control their own processes.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
