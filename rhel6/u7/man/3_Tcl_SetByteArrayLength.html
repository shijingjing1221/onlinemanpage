<p>Tcl_ByteArrayObj(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_ByteArrayObj(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_NewByteArrayObj, Tcl_SetByteArrayObj,
Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj, Tcl_SetByteArrayLength - manipulate
Tcl objects as a arrays of bytes</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj * Tcl_NewByteArrayObj(bytes, length)</p>

<p>void Tcl_SetByteArrayObj(objPtr, bytes, length)</p>

<p>unsigned char * Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj(objPtr,
lengthPtr)</p>

<p>unsigned char * Tcl_SetByteArrayLength(objPtr,
length)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS const unsigned char *bytes (in) The array of
bytes used to initialize or set a byte- array object.</p>

<p>int length (in) The length of the array of bytes. It
must be &gt;= 0.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in/out) For Tcl_SetByteArrayObj, this
points to the object to be converted to byte- array type.
For Tcl_Get- ByteArrayFromObj and Tcl_SetByteArrayLength,
this points to the object from which to get the byte-array
value; if objPtr does not already point to a byte-array
object, it will be con- verted to one.</p>

<p>int *lengthPtr (out) If non-NULL, filled with the length
of the array of bytes in the object.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are used to create, modify,
and read Tcl byte-array objects from C code. Byte-array
objects are typically used to hold the results of binary IO
operations or data structures created with the binary
command. In Tcl, an array of bytes is not equivalent to a
string. Conceptually, a string is an array of Unicode
characters, while a byte-array is an array of 8-bit
quantities with no implicit meaning. Accessor functions are
provided to get the string representa- tion of a byte-array
or to convert an arbitrary object to a byte-array. Obtaining
the string representation of a byte-array object (by calling
Tcl_GetStringFromObj) produces a properly formed UTF-8
sequence with a one-to-one mapping between the bytes in the
internal representation and the UTF-8 characters in the
string representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_NewByteArrayObj and Tcl_SetByteArrayObj will create
a new object of byte-array type or modify an existing object
to have a byte-array type. Both of these procedures set the
object s type to be byte-array and set the objects internal
representation to a copy of the array of bytes given by
bytes. Tcl_NewByteArrayObj returns a pointer to a newly
allo- cated object with a reference count of zero.
Tcl_SetByteArrayObj invalidates any old string
representation and, if the object is not already a
byte-array object, frees any old internal
representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj converts a Tcl object to
byte-array type and returns a pointer to the object s new
internal representation as an array of bytes. The length of
this array is stored in lengthPtr if lengthPtr is non-NULL.
The storage for the array of bytes is owned by the object
and should not be freed. The contents of the array may be
modified by the caller only if the object is not shared and
the caller invalidates the string representation.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetByteArrayLength converts the Tcl object to
byte-array type and changes the length of the objects
internal representation as an array of bytes. If length is
greater than the space currently allocated for the array,
the array is reallocated to the new length; the newly allo-
cated bytes at the end of the array have arbitrary values.
If length is less than the space currently allocated for the
array, the length of array is reduced to the new length. The
return value is a pointer to the objects new array of
bytes.</p>
