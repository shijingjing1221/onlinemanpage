<p>NAME dumpiso - dump IEEE 1394 isochronous channel
packets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dumpiso [ options ] [ FILE ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dumpiso listens on a selected range of
channels and dumps all received packets into the file FILE
or, if not given, to standard output. While dumping, the
current number of received packets is written to standard
error and updated with every packet.</p>

<p>It uses a simple file format for the dumps which is
described in iso- dump(5). The dumped packets can be sent
out again with sendiso(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --channels=CHANNELS Sets the channels to
listen on. CHANNELS can be either a single number, in which
case this is the only channel to listen on, or a range of
channels in the form X-Y. Channel numbers can range from 0
to 63. You can give this option multiple times, new channels
are added to the list of already set channels. Defaults to
all channels.</p>

<p>-p, --port=PORT Choose port PORT for receiving. A port
is a 1394 card or chip and represents one connected bus,
therefore this is only rele- vant when you have multiple of
these. Defaults to 0.</p>

<p>-h, --help Show help text and exit.</p>

<p>BUGS None known.</p>
