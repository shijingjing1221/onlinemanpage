<p>pilot-getromtoken(1) PILOT-LINK pilot-getromtoken(1)</p>

<p>NAME pilot-getromtoken - Reads a ROM token from a Palm
Handheld device.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Tools</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-getromtoken [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[--version] [-?|--help] [--usage] [-q|--quiet] [-t|--token
token] [-s|--sysinfo] [--ram] [--rom] [file- name]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Tokens you may currently extract are:</p>

<p>adcc: Entropy for internal A-&gt;D convertor
calibration</p>

<p>irda: Present only on memory card w/IrDA support</p>

<p>snum: Device serial number (from Memory Card Flash
ID)</p>

<p>pilot-getromtoken is used to fetch the ROM from your
Palm handheld for use in debugging Palm applications through
the use of POSE, the Palm OS Emulator application.</p>

<p>Note, because pilot-getrom uses the low-level RPC
protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do
not use this protocol, you cur- rently cannot fetch an OS5
ROM image using this utility. This will be updated in a
future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM images, using the
debugger protocol.</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-getromtoken options -t, --token token</p>

<p>A ROM token to read (i.e. snum)</p>

<p>-s, --sysinfo</p>

<p>Print SysInfo</p>

<p>--ram</p>

<p>Read RAM</p>

<p>--rom</p>

<p>Read ROM</p>

<p>&lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p>Write the ROM image to the file named by
&lt;filename&gt;. If this is omit- ted, the filename will be
written out as the rom version name as fol- lows:
pilot-$VERSION.rom_ ,where an OS 3.5 image would be written
as the filename of pilot-3.5.0.rom.</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port &lt;port&gt;</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the
Palm handheld. If this is not specified, pilot-getrom will
look for the $PILOTPORT environment variable. If neither are
found or supplied, pilot-getrom will print the usage
information.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet</p>

<p>Suppress Hit HotSync button message</p>

<p>-v, --version</p>

without connecting.</p>

<p>--usage</p>

<p>Display a brief usage message and exit without
connecting.</p>

<p>USAGE Connect to a target Palm handheld and fetch the
ROM for use in debug- ging Palm applications through the use
of POSE, the Palm OS Emulator or with the CoPilot

<p>BUGS Known Bugs pilot-getrom does not work with OS5
devices as yet, due to changes in the architecture and
design of the Palm HotSync protocol and file type changes
from m68k to ARM. Other than that, pilot-getrom has no known
bugs at this time.</p>
