<p>NAME sem_open - initialize and open a named
semaphore</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt; /* For O_* constants
*/ #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt; /* For mode constants */
#include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;</p>

<p>sem_t *sem_open(const char *name, int oflag); sem_t
*sem_open(const char *name, int oflag, mode_t mode, unsigned
int value);</p>

<p>Link with -lrt or -pthread.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sem_open() creates a new POSIX semaphore or
opens an existing semaphore. The semaphore is identified by
name. For details of the construction of name, see
sem_overview(7).</p>

<p>The oflag argument specifies flags that control the
operation of the call. (Definitions of the flags values can
be obtained by including &lt;fcntl.h&gt;.) If O_CREAT is
specified in oflag, then the semaphore is created if it does
not already exist. The owner (user ID) of the semaphore is
set to the effective user ID of the calling process. The
group ownership (group ID) is set to the effective group ID
of the calling process. If both O_CREAT and O_EXCL are
specified in oflag, then an error is returned if a semaphore
with the given name already exists.</p>

<p>If O_CREAT is specified in oflag, then two additional
arguments must be supplied. The mode argument specifies the
permissions to be placed on the new semaphore, as for
open(2). (Symbolic definitions for the per- missions bits
can be obtained by including &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;.) The
permis- sions settings are masked against the process umask.
Both read and write permission should be granted to each
class of user that will access the semaphore. The value
argument specifies the initial value for the new semaphore.
If O_CREAT is specified, and a semaphore with the given name
already exists, then mode and value are ignored.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, sem_open() returns the address
of the new semaphore; this address is used when calling
other semaphore-related functions. On error, sem_open()
returns SEM_FAILED, with errno set to indicate the
error.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES The semaphore exists, but the caller does
not have permission to open it.</p>

<p>EEXIST Both O_CREAT and O_EXCL were specified in oflag,
but a semaphore with this name already exists.</p>

<p>EINVAL value was greater than SEM_VALUE_MAX.</p>

<p>EINVAL name consists of just &quot;/&quot;, followed by
no other characters.</p>

<p>EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of
files and open.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG name was too long.</p>

<p>ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open
files has been reached.</p>

<p>ENOENT The O_CREAT flag was not specified in oflag and
no semaphore with this name exists; or, O_CREAT was
specified, but name wasnt well formed.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient memory.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO POSIX.1-2001.</p>
