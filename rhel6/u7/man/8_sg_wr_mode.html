<p>NAME sg_wr_mode - write mode page</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sg_wr_mode [--contents=H,H...] [--dbd]
[--force] [--help] [--len=10|6] [--mask=M,M...]
[--page=PG[,SPG]] [--save] [--verbose] [--version]
DEVICE</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Writes a modified mode page to DEVICE. Uses
the SCSI MODE SENSE (6 or 10 byte variant) command to fetch
the existing mode data which includes a mode page (or
subpage). It then combines that with the contents,
potentially masked, and writes the modified mode page with
the SCSI MODE SELECT (6 or 10 byte variant) command. This
utility does not mod- ify the block descriptor(s); if any
block descriptors are fetched by the MODE SENSE command then
the same block descriptors are written back with the
following MODE SELECT command.</p>

<p>If a contents argument is not given then the various
components (i.e. header, block descriptor(s) and mode page)
of the &quot;current&quot; values of the existing mode page
are printed out. In this case the mode page is not altered
on the device.</p>

<p>If the contents are specified, and a mask is not
specified, then the contents must match the existing mode
page in various aspects unless the --force option is given.
These include length, mode page code and subpage code if
applicable. If all is well then the contents string is
written to DEVICE as the new mode page.</p>

<p>If both contents and mask strings are specified then
only bit positions in the contents corresponding to set bits
in the mask are taken while the existing mode page supplies
bit positions corresponding to clear bits. When a mask is
given then the mask and/or the contents may be shorter than
the existing mode page. If the mask is shorter than the
contents then the remaining bytes are taken from the
contents. If the contents are shorter than the existing mode
page then the remaining bytes are taken from the existing
mod page.</p>

<p>The force option allows the contents string to be
written as the new mode page without any prior checks on the
existing mode page. This should only be required for vendor
specific mode pages. The existing mode data is ignored apart
from the block descriptors which can be sup- pressed with
the --dbd option if need be.</p>

<p>Changing individual fields in a mode page is probably
more easily done with the sdparm utility. Fields can be
identified by acronym or by a numerical descriptor.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Arguments to long options are mandatory for
short options as well.</p>

<p>-c, --contents=H,H... where H,H... is a string of comma
separated hex numbers each of which should resolve to a byte
value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). A (single) space separated
string of hex numbers is also allowed but the list needs to
be in quotes. This is the new contents of the mode page to
be written to DEVICE, potentially filtered by the mask
string.</p>

<p>-c, --contents=- reads contents string from stdin. The
hex numbers in the string may be comma, space, tab or
linefeed (newline) separated. If a line contains
&quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters on that line are
ignored. Otherwise each non separator character should
resolve to a byte value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). This forms
the new contents of the mode page to be written to DEVICE,
potentially filtered by the mask string.</p>

<p>-d, --dbd disable block descriptors (DBD flag in cdb).
Some device types include block descriptors in the mode data
returned by a MODE SENSE command. If so the same block
descriptors are written by the MODE SELECT command. This
option instructs the MODE SENSE command not to return any
block descriptors. This would be a sensible default for this
utility apart from the fact that not all SCSI devices
support the DBD bit in the cdb.</p>

<p>-f, --force force the contents string to be taken as the
new mode page, or at least doesnt do checks on the existing
mode page. Note that DEVICE may still reject the new
contents for the mode page. Can- not be given with the
--mask=M,M... option.</p>

<p>-h, --help output the usage message then exit.</p>

<p>-l, --len=10 | 6 length of the SCSI commands (cdb) sent
to DEVICE. The default is 10 so 10 byte MODE SENSE and MODE
SELECT commands are issued. Some old devices dont support
the 10 byte variants hence this option.</p>

<p>-m, --mask=M,M... where M,M... is a string of comma
separated hex numbers each of which should resolve to a byte
value (i.e. 0 to ff inclusive). A (single) space separated
string of hex numbers is also allowed but the list needs to
be in quotes. The mask chooses (bit by bit) whether the new
mode page comes from the contents (mask bit set) or from the
existing mode page (mask bit clear). If the mask string is
shorter than the contents string then the remain- ing bytes
are taken from the contents string. If the contents string
is shorter than the existing mode page then the remaining
bytes are taken from the existing mode page (i.e. they are
left unaltered).</p>

<p>-p, --page=PG where PG is the page code value to fetch
and modify. The page code is in hex and should be between 0
and 3e inclusive. Notice that page code 3f to fetch all mode
pages is disallowed.</p>

<p>-p, --page=PG,SPG where PG is the page code value and
SPG is the subpage code value to fetch and modify. Both
values are in hex. The subpage code should be between 0 and
fe inclusive. Notice that subpage code ff to fetch all mode
subpages (for a given mode page or all mode pages in the
case of 3f,ff) is disallowed.</p>

<p>-s, --save changes the &quot;saved&quot; mode page when
MODE SELECT is successful. By default (i.e. when --save is
not used) only the &quot;current&quot; mode page values are
changed when MODE SELECT is successful. In this case the new
mode page will stay in effect until the device is reset
(e.g. power cycled). When it restarts the &quot;saved&quot;
values for the mode page will be re-instated. So to make
changes per- manent use the --save option.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose increase the level of verbosity, (i.e.
debug output).</p>

<p>-V, --version print the version string and then
exit.</p>

<p>NOTES This utility does not check whether the contents
string is trying to modify parts of the mode page which are
changeable. The device should do that and if some part is
not changeable then it should report: &quot;Invalid field in
parameter list&quot;.</p>

<p>Some mode pages are not savable. If so an attempt to use
the --save option should cause an error to be reported from
the device: &quot;Illegal field in cdb&quot;.</p>

<p>The device is required to do various checks before it
accepts a new mode page. If these checks fail then the mode
page is not altered and either a &quot;parameter list length
error&quot; or an &quot;invalid field in parame- ter
list&quot; error is returned by the device in the sense
data.</p>

<p>The recommended way to modify a mode page is to read it
with a MODE SENSE, modify some part of it then write it back
to the device with a MODE SELECT command. For example,
reading an existing mode page can be accomplished with
sg_modes -p=1a -r /dev/sdb &gt; mp_1a.txt (the power
condition mode page). The mp_1a.txt file can be edited and
then used as the contents string to this utility (e.g.
sg_wr_mode -p 1a -s -c - /dev/sdb &lt; mp_1a.txt).</p>

<p>Two fields differ between what is read from the device
with MODE SENSE and what is written to the device with MODE
SELECT: the mode data length is reserved (i.e. zero(es)) in
a MODE SELECT command while the PS bit ((sub)page byte 0 bit
7) in each mode (sub)page is reserved (zero) in a MODE
SELECT command. The PS bit given in the contents string is
zeroed unless the --force option is selected.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES This utility can be used together with the
sg_modes utility. To re-instate the default mode page values
(i.e. the mode page values cho- sen by the manufacturer of
the device) as both the current and saved mode page values
the following sequence could be used:</p>

<p>$ sg_modes --control=2 --page=1a -r /dev/sda &gt; t $
sg_wr_mode --page=1a --contents=- --save /dev/sda &lt; t</p>

<p>Next is an example of using a mask to modify the
&quot;idle condition counter&quot; of the &quot;power
condition&quot; mode page (0x1a) from 0x28 to 0x37. Note
that the change is not saved so the &quot;idle condition
counter&quot; will revert to 0x28 after the next power
cycle. The output from sg_modes is abridged.</p>

<p>$ sg_modes --page=1a /dev/hdc &gt;&gt; Power condition
(mmc), page_control: current 00 1a 0a 00 03 00 00 00 28 00
00 01 2c</p>

<p>$ sg_wr_mode -p 1a -c 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37 -m
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,ff /dev/hdc</p>

<p>$ sg_modes -p 1a /dev/hdc &gt;&gt; Power condition
(mmc), page_control: current 00 1a 0a 00 03 00 00 00 37 00
00 01 2c</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The exit status of sg_wr_mode is 0 when it
is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
