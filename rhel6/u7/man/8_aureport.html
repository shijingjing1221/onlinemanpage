<p>AUREPORT:(8) System Administration Utilities
AUREPORT:(8)</p>

<p>NAME aureport - a tool that produces summary reports of
audit daemon logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS aureport [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION aureport is a tool that produces summary
reports of the audit system logs. The aureport utility can
also take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw
log data. The reports have a column label at the top to help
with interpretation of the various fields. Except for the
main summary report, all reports have the audit event
number. You can subsequently lookup the full event with
ausearch -a event number. You may need to specify start
&amp; stop times if you get multiple hits. The reports
produced by aureport can be used as building blocks for more
complicated analysis.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -au, --auth Report about authentication
attempts</p>

<p>-a, --avc Report about avc messages</p>

<p>-c, --config Report about config changes</p>

<p>-cr, --crypto Report about crypto events</p>

<p>-e, --event Report about events</p>

<p>-f, --file Report about files</p>

<p>--failed Only select failed events for processing in the
reports. The default is both success and failed events.</p>

<p>-h, --host Report about hosts</p>

<p>--help Print brief command summary</p>

<p>-i, --interpret Interpret numeric entities into text.
For example, uid is con- verted to account name. The
conversion is done using the current resources of the
machine where the search is being run. If you have renamed
the accounts, or dont have the same accounts on your
machine, you could get misleading results.</p>

<p>-if, --input file | directory Use the given file or
directory instead of the logs. This is to aid analysis where
the logs have been moved to another machine or only part of
a log was saved.</p>

<p>--input-logs Use the log file location from auditd.conf
as input for analy- sis. This is needed if you are using
aureport from a cron job.</p>

<p>-k, --key Report about audit rule keys</p>

<p>-l, --login Report about logins</p>

<p>-m, --mods Report about account modifications</p>

<p>-ma, --mac Report about Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
events</p>

<p>-n, --anomaly Report about anomaly events. These events
include NIC going into promiscuous mode and programs
segfaulting.</p>

<p>--node node-name Only select events originating from
node name string for pro- cessing in the reports. The
default is to include all nodes. Multiple nodes are
allowed.</p>

<p>-nc, --no-config Do not include the CONFIG_CHANGE event.
This is particularly useful for the key report because audit
rules have key labels in many cases. Using this option gets
rid of these false positives.</p>

<p>-p, --pid Report about processes</p>

<p>-r, --response Report about responses to anomaly
events</p>

<p>-s, --syscall Report about syscalls</p>

<p>--success Only select successful events for processing
in the reports. The default is both success and failed
events.</p>

<p>--summary Run the summary report that gives a total of
the elements of the main report. Not all reports have a
summary.</p>

<p>-t, --log This option will output a report of the start
and end times for each log.</p>

<p>--tty Report about tty keystrokes</p>

<p>-te, --end [end-date] [end-time] Search for events with
time stamps equal to or before the given end time. The
format of end time depends on your locale. If the date is
omitted, today is assumed. If the time is omitted, now is
assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or PM to
spec- ify time. An example date using the en_US.utf8 locale
is 09/03/2009. An example of time is 18:00:00. The date
format accepted is influenced by the LC_TIME environmental
variable.</p>

<p>You may also use the word: now, recent, today,
yesterday, this-week, week-ago, this-month, this-year. Today
means starting now. Recent is 10 minutes ago. Yesterday is 1
second after mid- night the previous day. This-week means
starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of the week
determined by your locale (see localtime). This-month means
1 second after midnight on day 1 of the month. This-year
means the 1 second after midnight on the first day of the
first month.</p>

<p>-tm, --terminal Report about terminals</p>

<p>-ts, --start [start-date] [start-time] Search for events
with time stamps equal to or after the given end time. The
format of end time depends on your locale. If the date is
omitted, today is assumed. If the time is omitted, mid-
night is assumed. Use 24 hour clock time rather than AM or
PM to specify time. An example date using the en_US.utf8
locale is 09/03/2009. An example of time is 18:00:00. The
date format accepted is influenced by the LC_TIME
environmental variable.</p>

<p>You may also use the word: now, recent, today,
yesterday, this-week, this-month, this-year. Today means
starting at 1 sec- ond after midnight. Recent is 10 minutes
ago. Yesterday is 1 second after midnight the previous day.
This-week means starting 1 second after midnight on day 0 of
the week determined by your locale (see localtime).
This-month means 1 second after midnight on day 1 of the
month. This-year means the 1 second after mid- night on the
first day of the first month.</p>

<p>-u, --user Report about users</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version and exit</p>

<p>-x, --executable Report about executables</p>
