<p>NAME pmdaactivemq - ActiveMQ performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdaactivemq is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports performance metrics from
ActiveMQ.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION This PMDA requires that ActiveMQ has been
installed with the Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge enabled. By
default the PNDA will connect to localhost at port 8161 with
a username and password of admin . This can be con- figured
in PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/activemq.conf</p>

<p>Install the ActiveMQ PMDA by using the Install script as
root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq # ./Install</p>

<p>To uninstall, do the following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdaactivemq is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/activemq.conf optional
configuration file for pmdaactivemq</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/Install installation script for
the pmdaactivemq agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/Remove undo installation script
for the pmdaactivemq agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/activemq.log default log file for
error messages from pmdaactivemq</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
