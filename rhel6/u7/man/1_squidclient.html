<p>NAME squidclient -- a simple HTTP web client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS squidclient [-arsv][-A string ][-g count] [-h
remote-host] [-H _ string_] [-i IMS] [-I ping-interval] [-j
_ Host-header] [-l local-host] [-m method] [-p port] [-P
file] [-t count] [-T timeout] [-u proxy-user] [-U www-user]

<p>DESCRIPTION squidclient is a tool providing a command
line interface for retrieving URLs. Designed for testing any
HTTP 0.9, 1.0, or 1.1 web server or proxy. This tool can be
combined with scripts to perform any basic HTTP operation.
Some additional features for access to the Squid proxy
object cache and management information are provided.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Do NOT include Accept: header.</p>

<p>-A string Send string as User-Agent: header. To omit the
header completely set string to empty ().</p>

<p>-g count Ping mode, perform count iterations (0 to loop
until inter- rupted).</p>

localhost.</p>

http_access deny purge !localhost</p>
