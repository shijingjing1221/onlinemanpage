<p>GSFTOPK(1) GSFTOPK(1)</p>

<p>NAME gsftopk - render a ghostscript font in TeX pk
form</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS gsftopk [-i path] [-q] [-t] [--debug=n]
[--dosnames] [--inter- preter=path] [--mapline=line]
[--mapfile=file] [--quiet] [--test] [--help] [--version]
font dpi</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS font Name of the font to be created.</p>

<p>dpi Desired resolution of the font to be created, in
dots per inch. This may be a real number.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION gsftopk is a program which calls up the
ghostscript program gs(1) to render a given font at a given
resolution. It packs the resulting characters into the pk
file format and writes them to a file whose name is formed
from the font name and the resolution (rounded to the
nearest integer). The font may be in any format acceptable
to Ghostscript, including .pfa, .pfb, .gsf, and .ttf
files.</p>

<p>This program should normally be called by a script, such
as mktexpk, to create fonts on demand.</p>

<p>gsftopk obtains the character widths from the .tfm file,
which must exist in the standard search path. It also must
be able to find the font in a map file (such as
psfonts.map), formatted as in dvips(1)), unless the
--mapline option is used. The set of map files is given by
the --mapfile option, or in the files config.ps,
$HOME/.dvipsrc, and config.gsftopk (as would be used by
dvips -Pgsftopk).</p>

<p>The following pk &quot;specials&quot; are added at the
end of the output file, to provide an internal check on the
contents of the file: &quot;jobname=font&quot;,
&quot;mag=1&quot;, &quot;mode=modeless&quot;, and
&quot;pixels_per_inch=dpi&quot;. This is in accor- dance
with the TeX Directory Standard (TDS).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --debug=n Set the Kpathsea debug flags according
to the integer n.</p>

<p>--dosnames Use a name of the form font.pk instead of
font.dpipk.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a brief help synopsis and exit.</p>

<p>-i path, --interpreter=path Use path as the Ghostscript
interpreter.</p>

<p>--mapfile=file Use file to look for the map information
for font. This should be the full name of the file (in other
words, no path searching algorithms are applied).</p>

<p>--mapline=line Use line instead of looking for an entry
in a map file. The first word of line must match font.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet Operate quietly; i.e., without writing any
messages to the stan- dard output.</p>

<p>-t, --test Test run: return zero status if the font can
be found in the map file(s), and nonzero status if it
cannot. If this option is specified, then the dpi argument
is optional (since the font will not be generated).</p>

<p>-v, --version Print the version number and exit.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DVIPSRC Name of file to read
instead of $HOME/.dvipsrc. This should be the full name of
the file (in other words, no path searching algorithms are
applied).</p>

<p>GSFTOPKFONTS See TFMFONTS.</p>

<p>GSFTOPKHEADERS See TEXPSHEADERS.</p>

<p>PSHEADERS See TEXPSHEADERS.</p>

<p>TEXCONFIG Colon-separated list of paths to search for
map files. An extra colon in the list will include the
compiled-in default paths at that point. A double slash will
enable recursive subdirectory searching at that point in the
path.</p>

<p>TFMFONTS Colon-separated list of paths to search for the
.tfm file associated with the font. Double slashes and extra
colons behave as with TEXCONFIG. This informa- tion may also
be supplied by using the environment variables TFMFONTS or
GSFTOPKFONTS. These environment variables are checked in the
order GSFTOPKFONTS, TFM- FONTS, TFMFONTS; the first one (if
any) having a value is used.</p>

<p>TEXPSHEADERS Colon-separated list of paths to search for
the Ghostscript driver file render.ps and for any PostScript
header or font files (.enc, .pfa, .pfb, .gsf, or .ttf
files). Double slashes and extra colons behave as with
TEXCONFIG. This information may also be supplied by using
the environment variables PSHEADERS or GSFTOPKHEADERS. These
environment variables are checked in the order
GSFTOPKHEADERS, TEXPSHEADERS, PSHEADERS; the first one (if
any) having a value is used.</p>

<p>TFMFONTS See TFMFONTS.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION In order to determine the set of map files
to be used and the path for finding PostScript files,
gsftopk reads, in order, the files config.ps, .dvipsrc, and
config.gsftopk. The files config.ps and config.gsftopk are
searched for using the environment variable TEXCONFIG, the
Kpathsea configuration file, or the compiled-in default
paths. The file .dvip- src is searched for in the users home
directory.</p>

<p>These files are in the same format as for dvips (as well
as being in the same locations). The entries used by gsftopk
are as follows.</p>

<p>H path Indicates that the Ghostscript driver file
render.ps and the PostScript header and font files are to be
searched for using path.</p>

<p>p file Indicates that the list of map files is to be
erased and replaced by file.</p>

<p>p +file Indicates that file is to be added to the list
of map files.</p>

<p>All other entries are ignored.</p>

<p>This is similar to the handling of these options when
running dvips -Pgsftopk. For more details, see the Kpathsea
manual.</p>

<p>BUGS gsftopk sometimes has trouble with fonts with very
complicated charac- ters (such as the Seal of the University
of California). This is because gsftopk uses the charpath
operator to determine the bounding box of each character. If
the character is too complicated, then old versions of
Ghostscript fail, causing gsftopk to terminate with an error
message</p>

<p>Call to gs stopped by signal 10</p>

<p>(The number may vary from system to system; it
corresponds to a bus error or a segmentation fault.) The
best way to fix this bug is to install a current version of
ghostscript. As an alternative, gsftopk can be instructed to
use the bounding box provided with the font (if one exists)
instead of finding a bounding box for each character. To do
this, include the string</p>

<p>/usefontbbox true def</p>

<p>in the font map file; e.g.,</p>

<p>ucseal &quot;/usefontbbox true def&quot;</p>

<p>This will not affect use of the font by dvips.</p>
