<p>NAME error::pass1 - systemtap pass-1 errors</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Errors that occur during pass 1 (parsing)
usually mean a basic syntax error of some sort occurred in
the systemtap script. There are several classes of problems
possible:</p>

<p>plain syntax error The systemtap script parser detects a
large variety of errors, such as missing operands, bad
punctuation. It tries to list what kinds of tokens it was
expecting to see, and will show the region of the source
code with the problem. Please review the stap(1) man page
and/or the tutorial, to correct the scripts syntax.</p>

<p>grammar ambiguities There is at least one known
ambiguity in the systemtap grammar. It relates to the
optionality of ; (semicolon) separators between statements,
and the ++ and -- increment/decrement opera- tors. If the
parser indicates an error, consider adding some explicit ;
separators between nearby statements and try again.</p>

<p>missing command line arguments A systemtap script that
uses the $N and @N constructs for sub- stituting in
command-line options may fail if not enough options were
given on the stap command line.</p>

<p>compatibility changes Some versions of systemtap have
changed the language incompati- bly, for example by adding
the try/catch keywords for exception handling. In such
cases, rerun systemtap with the --compatibil- ity=VERSION
option, substituting the last systemtap version where your
script was known to work. You may also check the
release-history NEWS file for compatibility changes.</p>

<p>GATHERING MORE INFORMATION Increasing the verbosity of
pass-1 with an option such as --vp 1 can help pinpoint the
problem.</p>
