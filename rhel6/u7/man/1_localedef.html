<p>NAME localedef - compile locale definition files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS localedef [-f charmapfile] [-i inputfile]
[--force] [--verbose] [--posix] [--quiet] outputpath
localedef --version localedef --help</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The localedef program reads the indicated
charmap and input files, com- piles them to a form usable by
the locale(7) functions in the C library, and places the six
output files in the outputpath directory.</p>

<p>If no charmapfile is given, POSIX is used by default. If
no inputfile is given, or if it is given as -, localedef
reads from standard input.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Most options can have either short or long
forms. If multiple short options are used, they can be
combined in one word (e.g. -cv). If an option takes an
argument, the argument can be given separately as the next
word, or it can be written as option=argument.</p>

<p>-f charmapfile, --charmap=charmapfile Specify the file
that defines the symbolic character names that are used by
the input file. If the file is in the default directory for
character maps, it is not necessary to specify the full
pathname. This default directory is printed by localedef
--help.</p>

<p>-i inputfile, --inputfile=inputfile Specify the locale
definition file to compile. If inputfile is not absolute,
localedef will also look in the directory speci- fied by the
environment variable I18NPATH and in the default directory
for locale definition files. This default directory is
printed by localedef --help.</p>

<p>-c, --force Write the output files even if warnings were
generated about the input file.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose Generate extra warnings about errors that
are normally ignored.</p>

<p>--quiet Suppress all notifications and warnings, and
report only fatal errors.</p>

<p>--posix Be strictly POSIX conformant. Implies --verbose.
This option currently has no other effect. Posix conformance
is assumed if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
set.</p>

<p>-u codeset, --code-set-name=codeset This option is
accepted but ignored.</p>

<p>-h, --help Print a usage summary and exit. Also prints
the default paths used by localedef.</p>

<p>-V, --version Print the version number, license, and
disclaimer of warranty for localedef.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT POSIXLY_CORRECT The --posix flag is assumed
if this environment variable is set.</p>

<p>I18NPATH The default directory for locale definition
files.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/share/i18n/charmaps Usual default charmap
path.</p>

<p>/usr/share/locale Usual default output path. See the
output from localedef --help for the paths used in your
version.</p>

<p>outputpath/LC_COLLATE One of the output files. It
describes the rules for comparing strings in the locales
alphabet.</p>

<p>outputpath/LC_CTYPE One of the output files. It contains
information about charac- ter cases and case conversions for
the locale.</p>

<p>outputpath/LC_MONETARY One of the output files. It
describes the way monetary values should be formatted in the
locale.</p>

<p>outputpath/LC_MESSAGES/SYS_LC_MESSAGES One of the output
files. It contains information about the lan- guage messages
should be printed in, and what an affirmative or negative
answer looks like.</p>

<p>outputpath/LC_NUMERIC One of the output files. It
describes the rules for formatting numbers in the
locale.</p>

<p>outputpath/LC_TIME One of the output files. It describes
the rules for formatting times and dates in the locale.</p>
