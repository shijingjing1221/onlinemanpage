<p>NAME ppmwheel - make a PPM image of a color wheel</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ppmwheel diameter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p>ppmwheel produces a PPM image of a color wheel of the
specified diame- ter inside a white square just large enough
to hold it.</p>

<p>The color wheel is based on the HSV color model. Hues
are distributed angularly around the circle and the values
are distributed radially and the saturation is zero
everywhere. The values are zero at the center, increasing
linearly to maximum at the edge. The maximum value corre-
sponds to the maxval of the PPM image.</p>

<p>Hence, the image contains all of the secondary colors
based on the red, green, and blue primary colors. A
secondary color is one that is com- posed of light of at
most two of the three primary colors.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None.</p>

<p>HISTORY ppmwheel was added to Netpbm in Release 10.14
(March 2003).</p>
