<p>TPM Management - tpm_clear</p>

<p>NAME tpm_clear - return the TPM to the default state
(unowned, disabled, inactive)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS tpm_clear [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION tpm_clear requests that the systems TPM
perform a clear (via the TPM_OwnerClear API) wiping out all
ownership information, in effect invalidaing all keys and
data tied to the TPM, as well as disabling and deactivating
the TPM. This operation will prompt for the owner password.
The --force option relies on Phyiscal Presence to authorize
the command (via the TPM_ForceClear API) skipping the owner
password prompt. The TPM OwnerClear API can be disabled
until the current owner is cleared, requiring use of the
--force with tpm_setclearable command. The TPM_ForceClear
API can be disabled for the current boot cycle with the
tpm_setclearable command. This command requires a reboot to
complete the operation.</p>

<p>-h, --help Display command usage info.</p>

<p>-v, --version Display command version info.</p>

<p>-l, --log [none|error|info|debug] Set logging level.</p>

<p>-u, --unicode Use TSS UNICODE encoding for passwords to

<p>-f, --force Rely on Physical Presence for authorization;
therefore, do not prompt for owner password.</p>

<p>-z, --well-known Authenticate using 20 bytes of zeros as
owner password (the default TSS Well Known Secret), instead
of prompting for an owner password.</p>
