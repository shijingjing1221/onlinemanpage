<p>NAME rmdir - delete a directory</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int rmdir(const char *pathname);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION rmdir() deletes a directory, which must be
empty.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, zero is returned. On error, -1
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.</p>

<p>ERRORS EACCES Write access to the directory containing
pathname was not allowed, or one of the directories in the
path prefix of path- name did not allow search permission.
(See also path_resolu- tion(7).</p>

<p>EBUSY pathname is currently in use by the system or some
process that prevents its removal. On Linux this means
pathname is currently used as a mount point or is the root
directory of the calling process.</p>

<p>EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address
space.</p>

<p>EINVAL pathname has . as last component.</p>

<p>ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in
resolving pathname.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG pathname was too long.</p>

<p>ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist
or is a dan- gling symbolic link.</p>

<p>ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR pathname, or a component used as a directory in
pathname, is not, in fact, a directory.</p>

<p>ENOTEMPTY pathname contains entries other than . and ..
; or, pathname has .. as its final component. POSIX.1-2001
also allows EEXIST for this condition.</p>

<p>EPERM The directory containing pathname has the sticky
bit (S_ISVTX) set and the processs effective user ID is
neither the user ID of the file to be deleted nor that of
the directory containing it, and the process is not
privileged (Linux: does not have the CAP_FOWNER
capability).</p>

<p>EPERM The file system containing pathname does not
support the removal of directories.</p>

<p>EROFS pathname refers to a directory on a read-only file
system.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.</p>

<p>BUGS Infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS can
cause the unexpected disappearance of directories which are
still being used.</p>
