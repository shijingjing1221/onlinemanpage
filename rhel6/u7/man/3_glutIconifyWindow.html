<p>NAME glutIconifyWindow - Iconify the current window</p>

<p>LIBRARY OpenGLUT - window</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;openglut.h&gt;</p>

<p>void glutIconifyWindow(void);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Most window systems have some kind of
minimized or iconified state for windows. All systems
currently supported by OpenGLUT do so. The exact meaning of
iconification is somewhat system-dependant, but this makes a
request of the window system to place the window into this
state.</p>

<p>Graphic output is usually suspended in this form. User
input may be par- tially or wholly suspended.</p>

<p>If and when your window is iconified by the window
system, it may be uni- conified at any time by the system.
This usually happens at the request of a user. Because of
this, you should not use this function to hide a window.
Rather, it is to help unclutter the users display, and is
more or less consensual with the user. Use glutHideWindow()
if you want to hide the window entirely.</p>

<p>CAVEATS Applies only to onscreen, top-level windows.</p>

<p>Not guaranteed to have any effect; effect may be
arbitrarily delayed.</p>

<p>There is no callback that specifically tells you when
(or if) your window is iconified.</p>
