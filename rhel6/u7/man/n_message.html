<p>NAME message - Create and manipulate message widgets</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS message pathName ?options?</p>

<p>STANDARD OPTIONS -anchor -background -borderwidth
-cursor -font -foreground -highlightbackground
-highlightcolor -highlightthickness -padx -pady -relief
-takefocus -text -textvariable</p>

<p>See the options manual entry for details on the standard
options.</p>

<p>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS Command-Line Name:-aspect
Database Name: aspect Database Class: Aspect</p>

<p>Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating
desired aspect ratio for the text. The aspect ratio is
specified as 100*width/height. 100 means the text should be
as wide as it is tall, 200 means the text should be twice as
wide as it is tall, 50 means the text should be twice as
tall as it is wide, and so on. Used to choose line length
for text if width option is not specified. Defaults to
150.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-justify Database Name: justify
Database Class: Justify</p>

<p>Specifies how to justify lines of text. Must be one of
left, center, or right. Defaults to left. This option works
together with the anchor, aspect, padX, padY, and width
options to pro- vide a variety of arrangements of the text
within the window. The aspect and width options determine
the amount of screen space needed to display the text. The
anchor, padX, and padY options determine where this
rectangular area is displayed within the widgets window, and
the justify option determines how each line is displayed
within that rectangular region. For example, suppose anchor
is e and justify is left, and that the message window is
much larger than needed for the text. The text will be
displayed so that the left edges of all the lines line up
and the right edge of the longest line is padX from the
right side of the window; the entire text block will be cen-
tered in the vertical span of the window.</p>

<p>Command-Line Name:-width Database Name: width Database
Class: Width</p>

<p>Specifies the length of lines in the window. The value
may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If
this option has a value greater than zero then the aspect
option is ignored and the width option determines the line
length. If this option has a value less than or equal to
zero, then the aspect option determines the line length.

<p>DESCRIPTION The message command creates a new window
(given by the pathName argu- ment) and makes it into a
message widget. Additional options, described above, may be
specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the message such as its colors, font,
text, and initial relief. The message command returns its
pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named pathName, but pathNames
parent must exist.</p>

<p>A message is a widget that displays a textual string. A
message widget has three special features. First, it breaks
up its string into lines in order to produce a given aspect
ratio for the window. The line breaks are chosen at word
boundaries wherever possible (if not even a single word
would fit on a line, then the word will be split across
lines). Newline characters in the string will force line
breaks; they can be used, for example, to leave blank lines
in the display.</p>

<p>The second feature of a message widget is justification.
The text may be displayed left-justified (each line starts
at the left side of the window), centered on a line-by-line
basis, or right-justified (each line ends at the right side
of the window).</p>

<p>The third feature of a message widget is that it handles
control char- acters and non-printing characters specially.
Tab characters are replaced with enough blank space to line
up on the next 8-character boundary. Newlines cause line
breaks. Other control characters (ASCII code less than 0x20)
and characters not defined in the font are dis- played as a
four-character sequence hh where hh is the two-digit hex-
adecimal number corresponding to the character. In the
unusual case where the font does not contain all of the
characters in 0123456789abcdefhen control characters and
undefined characters are not displayed at all.</p>

<p>WIDGET COMMAND The message command creates a new Tcl
command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to
invoke various operations on the widget. It has the
following general form: pathName option ?arg arg ...? Option
and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
The following commands are possible for message widgets:</p>

<p>pathName cget option Returns the current value of the
configuration option given by option. Option may have any of
the values accepted by the mes- sage command.</p>

<p>pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If
no option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
avail- able options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
information on the format of this list). If option is
specified with no value, then the command returns a list
describing the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the
values accepted by the message command.</p>

<p>DEFAULT BINDINGS When a new message is created, it has
no default event bindings: mes- sages are intended for
output purposes only.</p>

<p>BUGS Tabs do not work very well with text that is
centered or right-justi- fied. The most common result is
that the line is justified wrong.</p>
