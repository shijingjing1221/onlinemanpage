<p>NAME dropwatch - kernel dropped packet monitoring
utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS dropwatch [-l &lt;method&gt; | list]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION dropwatch dropwatch is an interactive
utility for monitoring and recording packets that are
dropped by the kernel</p>

<p>OPTIONS -l &lt;method&gt; | list Select the translation
method to use when a drop alert arrives. By default the raw
instruction pointer of a drop location is output, but by the
use of the -l option, we can assign a trans- lation method
so that the instruction pointer can be translated into
function names. Currently supported lookup methods are:</p>

<p>kas - use /proc/kallsyms to lookup instruction pointers
to function mappings</p>

<p>INTERACTIVE COMMANDS start Tells the kernel to start
reporting dropped packets</p>

<p>stop Tells the kernel to discontinue reporting dropped
packets</p>

<p>exit Exits the dropmonitor program</p>

<p>help Displays summary of all commands</p>

<p>set alertlimit &lt;value&gt; Sets a triggerpoint to stop
monitoring for dropped packets after &lt;value&gt; alerts
have been received</p>
