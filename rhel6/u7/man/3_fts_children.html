<p>NAME fts, fts_open, fts_read, fts_children, fts_set,
fts_close - traverse a file hierarchy</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include
&lt;sys/stat.h&gt; #include &lt;fts.h&gt;</p>

<p>FTS *fts_open(char * const *path_argv, int options, int
(*compar)(const FTSENT **, const FTSENT **));</p>

<p>FTSENT *fts_read(FTS *ftsp);</p>

<p>FTSENT *fts_children(FTS *ftsp, int options);</p>

<p>int fts_set(FTS *ftsp, FTSENT *f, int options);</p>

<p>int fts_close(FTS *ftsp);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The fts functions are provided for
traversing file hierarchies. A sim- ple overview is that the
fts_open() function returns a &quot;handle&quot; on a file
hierarchy, which is then supplied to the other fts
functions. The function fts_read() returns a pointer to a
structure describing one of the files in the file hierarchy.
The function fts_children() returns a pointer to a linked
list of structures, each of which describes one of the files
contained in a directory in the hierarchy. In general,
directories are visited two distinguishable times; in
pre-order (before any of their descendants are visited) and
in post-order (after all of their descendants have been
visited). Files are visited once. It is possible to walk the
hierarchy &quot;logically&quot; (ignoring symbolic links) or
physically (visiting symbolic links), order the walk of the
hierarchy or prune and/or re-visit portions of the
hierarchy.</p>

<p>Two structures are defined (and typedefd) in the include
file &lt;fts.h&gt;. The first is FTS, the structure that
represents the file hierarchy itself. The second is FTSENT,
the structure that represents a file in the file hierarchy.
Normally, an FTSENT structure is returned for every file in
the file hierarchy. In this manual page, &quot;file&quot;
and &quot;FTSENT structure&quot; are generally
interchangeable. The FTSENT structure contains at least the
following fields, which are described in greater detail
below:</p>

<p>typedef struct _ftsent { unsigned short fts_info; /*
flags for FTSENT structure */ char *fts_accpath; /* access
path */ char *fts_path; /* root path */ short fts_pathlen;
/* strlen(fts_path) */ char *fts_name; /* filename */ short
fts_namelen; /* strlen(fts_name) */ short fts_level; /*
depth (-1 to N) */ int fts_errno; /* file errno */ long
fts_number; /* local numeric value */ void *fts_pointer; /*
local address value */ struct ftsent *fts_parent; /* parent
directory */ struct ftsent *fts_link; /* next file structure
*/ struct ftsent *fts_cycle; /* cycle structure */ struct
stat *fts_statp; /* stat(2) information */ } FTSENT;</p>

<p>These fields are defined as follows:</p>

<p>fts_info One of the following flags describing the
returned FTSENT structure and the file it represents. With
the exception of directories without errors (FTS_D), all of
these entries are terminal, that is, they will not be
revisited, nor will any of their descendants be visited.</p>

<p>FTS_D A directory being visited in pre-order.</p>

<p>FTS_DC A directory that causes a cycle in the tree. (The
fts_cycle field of the FTSENT structure will be filled in as
well.)</p>

<p>FTS_DEFAULT Any FTSENT structure that represents a file
type not explicitly described by one of the other fts_info
values.</p>

<p>FTS_DNR A directory which cannot be read. This is an
error return, and the fts_errno field will be set to
indicate what caused the error.</p>

<p>FTS_DOT A file named &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot;
which was not speci- fied as a filename to fts_open() (see
FTS_SEE- DOT).</p>

<p>FTS_DP A directory being visited in post-order. The
contents of the FTSENT structure will be unchanged from when
it was returned in pre- order, that is, with the fts_info
field set to FTS_D.</p>

<p>FTS_ERR This is an error return, and the fts_errno field
will be set to indicate what caused the error.</p>

<p>FTS_F A regular file.</p>

<p>FTS_NS A file for which no stat(2) information was
available. The contents of the fts_statp field are
undefined. This is an error return, and the fts_errno field
will be set to indicate what caused the error.</p>

<p>FTS_NSOK A file for which no stat(2) information was
requested. The contents of the fts_statp field are
undefined.</p>

<p>FTS_SL A symbolic link.</p>

<p>FTS_SLNONE A symbolic link with a nonexistent target.
The contents of the fts_statp field reference the file
characteristic information for the sym- bolic link
itself.</p>

<p>fts_accpath A path for accessing the file from the
current directory.</p>

<p>fts_path The path for the file relative to the root of
the traver- sal. This path contains the path specified to
fts_open() as a prefix.</p>

<p>fts_pathlen The length of the string referenced by
fts_path.</p>

<p>fts_name The name of the file.</p>

<p>fts_namelen The length of the string referenced by
fts_name.</p>

<p>fts_level The depth of the traversal, numbered from -1
to N, where this file was found. The FTSENT structure
representing the parent of the starting point (or root) of
the traversal is numbered -1, and the FTSENT structure for
the root itself is numbered 0.</p>

<p>fts_errno Upon return of a FTSENT structure from the
fts_children() or fts_read() functions, with its fts_info
field set to FTS_DNR, FTS_ERR or FTS_NS, the fts_errno field
contains the value of the external variable errno specifying
the cause of the error. Otherwise, the contents of the
fts_errno field are undefined.</p>

<p>fts_number This field is provided for the use of the
application pro- gram and is not modified by the fts
functions. It is ini- tialized to 0.</p>

<p>fts_pointer This field is provided for the use of the
application pro- gram and is not modified by the fts
functions. It is ini- tialized to NULL.</p>

<p>fts_parent A pointer to the FTSENT structure referencing
the file in the hierarchy immediately above the current
file, that is, the directory of which this file is a member.
A parent structure for the initial entry point is provided
as well, however, only the fts_level, fts_number and
fts_pointer fields are guaranteed to be initialized.</p>

<p>fts_link Upon return from the fts_children() function,
the fts_link field points to the next structure in the
NULL-terminated linked list of directory members. Otherwise,
the contents of the fts_link field are undefined.</p>

<p>fts_cycle If a directory causes a cycle in the hierarchy
(see FTS_DC), either because of a hard link between two
directo- ries, or a symbolic link pointing to a directory,
the fts_cycle field of the structure will point to the
FTSENT structure in the hierarchy that references the same
file as the current FTSENT structure. Otherwise, the
contents of the fts_cycle field are undefined.</p>

<p>fts_statp A pointer to stat(2) information for the
file.</p>

<p>A single buffer is used for all of the paths of all of
the files in the file hierarchy. Therefore, the fts_path and
fts_accpath fields are guaranteed to be NULL-terminated only
for the file most recently returned by fts_read(). To use
these fields to reference any files represented by other
FTSENT structures will require that the path buffer be
modified using the information contained in that FTSENT
structure s fts_pathlen field. Any such modifications should
be undone before further calls to fts_read() are attempted.
The fts_name field is always NULL-terminated.</p>

<p>fts_open() The fts_open() function takes a pointer to an
array of character point- ers naming one or more paths which
make up a logical file hierarchy to be traversed. The array
must be terminated by a NULL pointer.</p>

<p>There are a number of options, at least one of which
(either FTS_LOGI- CAL or FTS_PHYSICAL) must be specified.
The options are selected by oring the following values:</p>

<p>FTS_COMFOLLOW This option causes any symbolic link
specified as a root path to be followed immediately whether
or not FTS_LOGICAL is also specified.</p>

<p>FTS_LOGICAL This option causes the fts routines to
return FTSENT structures for the targets of symbolic links
instead of the symbolic links themselves. If this option is
set, the only symbolic links for which FTSENT structures are
returned to the application are those referencing nonexis-
tent files. Either FTS_LOGICAL or FTS_PHYSICAL must be
provided to the fts_open() function.</p>

<p>FTS_NOCHDIR As a performance optimization, the fts
functions change directories as they walk the file
hierarchy. This has the side-effect that an application
cannot rely on being in any particular directory during the
traversal. The FTS_NOCHDIR option turns off this
optimization, and the fts functions will not change the
current directory. Note that applications should not
themselves change their cur- rent directory and try to
access files unless FTS_NOCHDIR is specified and absolute
pathnames were provided as argu- ments to fts_open().</p>

<p>FTS_NOSTAT By default, returned FTSENT structures
reference file characteristic information (the statp field)
for each file visited. This option relaxes that requirement
as a per- formance optimization, allowing the fts functions
to set the fts_info field to FTS_NSOK and leave the contents
of the statp field undefined.</p>

<p>FTS_PHYSICAL This option causes the fts routines to
return FTSENT structures for symbolic links themselves
instead of the target files they point to. If this option is
set, FTSENT structures for all symbolic links in the
hierarchy are returned to the application. Either
FTS_LOGICAL or FTS_PHYSICAL must be provided to the
fts_open() function.</p>

<p>FTS_SEEDOT By default, unless they are specified as path
arguments to fts_open(), any files named &quot;.&quot; or
&quot;..&quot; encountered in the file hierarchy are
ignored. This option causes the fts routines to return
FTSENT structures for them.</p>

<p>FTS_XDEV This option prevents fts from descending into
directories that have a different device number than the
file from which the descent began.</p>

<p>The argument compar() specifies a user-defined function
which may be used to order the traversal of the hierarchy.
It takes two pointers to pointers to FTSENT structures as
arguments and should return a negative value, zero, or a
positive value to indicate if the file referenced by its
first argument comes before, in any order with respect to,
or after, the file referenced by its second argument. The
fts_accpath, fts_path and fts_pathlen fields of the FTSENT
structures may never be used in this comparison. If the
fts_info field is set to FTS_NS or FTS_NSOK, the fts_statp
field may not either. If the compar() argument is NULL, the
directory traversal order is in the order listed in
path_argv for the root paths, and in the order listed in the
directory for everything else.</p>

<p>fts_read() The fts_read() function returns a pointer to
an FTSENT structure describing a file in the hierarchy.
Directories (that are readable and do not cause cycles) are
visited at least twice, once in pre-order and once in
post-order. All other files are visited at least once. (Hard
links between directories that do not cause cycles or
symbolic links to symbolic links may cause files to be
visited more than once, or direc- tories more than
twice.)</p>

<p>If all the members of the hierarchy have been returned,
fts_read() returns NULL and sets the external variable errno
to 0. If an error unrelated to a file in the hierarchy
occurs, fts_read() returns NULL and sets errno
appropriately. If an error related to a returned file
occurs, a pointer to an FTSENT structure is returned, and
errno may or may not have been set (see fts_info).</p>

<p>The FTSENT structures returned by fts_read() may be
overwritten after a call to fts_close() on the same file
hierarchy stream, or, after a call to fts_read() on the same
file hierarchy stream unless they represent a file of type
directory, in which case they will not be overwritten until
after a call to fts_read() after the FTSENT structure has
been returned by the function fts_read() in post-order.</p>

<p>fts_children() The fts_children() function returns a
pointer to an FTSENT structure describing the first entry in
a NULL-terminated linked list of the files in the directory
represented by the FTSENT structure most recently returned
by fts_read(). The list is linked through the fts_link field
of the FTSENT structure, and is ordered by the user-
specified comparison function, if any. Repeated calls to
fts_chil- dren() will recreate this linked list.</p>

<p>As a special case, if fts_read() has not yet been called
for a hierar- chy, fts_children() will return a pointer to
the files in the logical directory specified to fts_open(),
that is, the arguments specified to fts_open(). Otherwise,
if the FTSENT structure most recently returned by fts_read()
is not a directory being visited in pre-order, or the
directory does not contain any files, fts_children() returns
NULL and sets errno to zero. If an error occurs,
fts_children() returns NULL and sets errno
appropriately.</p>

<p>The FTSENT structures returned by fts_children() may be
overwritten after a call to fts_children(), fts_close() or
fts_read() on the same file hierarchy stream.</p>

<p>Option may be set to the following value:</p>

<p>FTS_NAMEONLY Only the names of the files are needed. The
contents of all the fields in the returned linked list of
structures are undefined with the exception of the fts_name
and fts_namelen fields.</p>

<p>fts_set() The function fts_set() allows the user
application to determine further processing for the file f
of the stream ftsp. The fts_set() function returns 0 on
success, and -1 if an error occurs. Option must be set to
one of the following values:</p>

<p>FTS_AGAIN Re-visit the file; any file type may be
re-visited. The next call to fts_read() will return the
referenced file. The fts_stat and fts_info fields of the
structure will be reinitialized at that time, but no other
fields will have been changed. This option is meaningful
only for the most recently returned file from fts_read().
Normal use is for post-order directory visits, where it
causes the directory to be re-visited (in both pre and
post-order) as well as all of its descendants.</p>

<p>FTS_FOLLOW The referenced file must be a symbolic link.
If the ref- erenced file is the one most recently returned
by fts_read(), the next call to fts_read() returns the file
with the fts_info and fts_statp fields reinitialized to
reflect the target of the symbolic link instead of the
symbolic link itself. If the file is one of those most
recently returned by fts_children(), the fts_info and
fts_statp fields of the structure, when returned by
fts_read(), will reflect the target of the symbolic link
instead of the symbolic link itself. In either case, if the
target of the symbolic link does not exist the fields of the
returned structure will be unchanged and the fts_info field
will be set to FTS_SLNONE.</p>

<p>If the target of the link is a directory, the pre-order
return, followed by the return of all of its descendants,
followed by a post-order return, is done.</p>

<p>FTS_SKIP No descendants of this file are visited. The
file may be one of those most recently returned by either
fts_chil- dren() or fts_read().</p>

<p>fts_close() The fts_close() function closes a file
hierarchy stream ftsp and restores the current directory to
the directory from which fts_open() was called to open ftsp.
The fts_close() function returns 0 on suc- cess, and -1 if
an error occurs.</p>

<p>ERRORS The function fts_open() may fail and set errno
for any of the errors specified for open(2) and
malloc(3).</p>

<p>The function fts_close() may fail and set errno for any
of the errors specified for chdir(2) and close(2).</p>

<p>The functions fts_read() and fts_children() may fail and
set errno for any of the errors specified for chdir(2),
malloc(3), opendir(3), read- dir(3) and stat(2).</p>

<p>In addition, fts_children(), fts_open() and fts_set()
may fail and set errno as follows:</p>

<p>EINVAL The options were invalid.</p>
