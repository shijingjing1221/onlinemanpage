<p>SNMPSTATUS(1) Net-SNMP SNMPSTATUS(1)</p>

<p>NAME snmpstatus - retrieves a fixed set of management
information from a network entity</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS snmpstatus [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION snmpstatus is an SNMP application that
retrieves several important statistics from a network
entity.</p>

<p>AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is
instrumented to monitor the given objects. At its simplest,
the AGENT specification will con- sist of a hostname or an
IPv4 address. n this situation, the command will attempt
communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of
the given target host.</p>

<p>See the snmpcmd(1) manual page for a full list of the
possible formats for AGENT.</p>

<p>The information returned is:</p>

<p>The IP address of the entity. A textual description of
the entity (sysDescr.0) The uptime of the entitys SNMP agent
(sysUpTime.0) The sum of received packets on all interfaces
(ifInUCastPkts.* + ifInNUCastPkts.*) The sum of transmitted
packets on all interfaces (ifOutUCastP- kts.* +
ifOutNUCastPkts.*) The number of IP input packets
(ipInReceives.0) The number of IP output packets
(ipOutRequests.0)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>snmpstatus -c public -v 1 netdev-kbox.cc.cmu.edu</p>

<p>will produce output similar to the following:</p>

<p>[128.2.56.220]=&gt;[Kinetics FastPath2] Up: 1 day,
4:43:31 Interfaces: 1, Recv/Trans packets: 262874/39867 |
IP: 31603/15805</p>

<p>snmpstatus also checks the operational status of all
interfaces (ifOp- erStatus.*), and if it finds any that are
not running, it will report in a manner similar to this:</p>

<p>2 interfaces are down!</p>

<p>If the network entity has an error processing the
request packet, an error packet will be returned and a
message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what way the
request was malformed. snmpstatus will attempt to reform its
request to eliminate the malformed variable (unless the -Cf
option is given, see below), but this variable will then be
missing from the displayed data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS COMMON OPTIONS Please see snmpcmd(1) for a list
of possible values for COMMON OPTIONS as well as their
descriptions.</p>

<p>-Cf By default, snmpstatus will try to fix errors
returned by the agent and retry a request. In this
situation, the command will display the data that it can. If
the -Cf option is specified, then snmpstatus will not try to
fix errors, and the error will cause the command to
terminate.</p>
