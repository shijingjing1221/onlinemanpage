<p>Tcl_BooleanObj(3) Tcl Library Procedures
Tcl_BooleanObj(3)</p>


<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>NAME Tcl_NewBooleanObj, Tcl_SetBooleanObj,
Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj - store/retrieve boolean value in a
Tcl_Obj</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj * Tcl_NewBooleanObj(boolValue)</p>

<p>Tcl_SetBooleanObj(objPtr, boolValue)</p>

<p>int Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj(interp, objPtr, boolPtr)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS int boolValue (in) Integer value to be stored
as a boolean value in a Tcl_Obj.</p>

<p>Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in/out) Points to the Tcl_Obj in which
to store, or from which to retrieve a boolean value.</p>

<p>Tcl_Interp *interp (in/out) If a boolean value cannot be
retrieved, an error message is left in the interpreter s
result object unless interp is NULL.</p>

<p>int *boolPtr (out) Points to place where Tcl_Get-
BooleanFromObj stores the boolean value (0 or 1) obtained
from objPtr.
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are used to pass boolean
values to and from Tcl as Tcl_Objs. When storing a boolean
value into a Tcl_Obj, any non-zero integer value in
boolValue is taken to be the boolean value 1, and the
integer value 0 is taken to be the boolean value 0.</p>

<p>Tcl_NewBooleanObj creates a new Tcl_Obj, stores the
boolean value boolValue in it, and returns a pointer to the
new Tcl_Obj. The new Tcl_Obj has reference count of
zero.</p>

<p>Tcl_SetBooleanObj accepts objPtr, a pointer to an
existing Tcl_Obj, and stores in the Tcl_Obj *objPtr the
boolean value boolValue. This is a write operation on
*objPtr, so objPtr must be unshared. Attempts to write to a
shared Tcl_Obj will panic. A successful write of boolValue
into *objPtr implies the freeing of any former value stored
in *objPtr.</p>

<p>Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj attempts to retrive a boolean
value from the value stored in *objPtr. If objPtr holds a
string value recognized by Tcl_GetBoolean, then the
recognized boolean value is written at the address given by
boolPtr. If objPtr holds any value recognized as a number by
Tcl, then if that value is zero a 0 is written at the
address given by boolPtr and if that value is non-zero a 1
is written at the address given by boolPtr. In all cases
where a value is written at the address given by boolPtr,
Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj returns TCL_OK. If the value of objPtr
does not meet any of the conditions above, then TCL_ERROR is
returned and an error message is left in the interpreters
result unless interp is NULL. Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj may also
make changes to the internal fields of *objPtr so that
future calls to Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj on the same objPtr can
be performed more effi- ciently.</p>

<p>Note that the routines Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj and
Tcl_GetBoolean are not functional equivalents. The set of
values for which Tcl_GetBooleanFro- mObj will return TCL_OK
is strictly larger than the set of values for which
Tcl_GetBoolean will do the same. For example, the value 5
passed to Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj will lead to a TCL_OK return
(and the boolean value 1), while the same value passed to
Tcl_GetBoolean will lead to a TCL_ERROR return.</p>
