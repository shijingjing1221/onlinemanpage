<p>GROFF_MDOC(7) BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual
GROFF_MDOC(7)</p>

<p>NAME groff_mdoc - reference for groffs mdoc
implementation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff -mdoc file ...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A complete reference for writing UNIX manual
pages with the -mdoc macro package; a content-based and
domain-based formatting package for GNU troff(1). Its
predecessor, the -man(7) package, addressed page layout
leaving the manipulation of fonts and other typesetting
details to the individual author. In -mdoc, page layout
macros make up the page structure domain which consists of
macros for titles, section headers, displays and lists -
essentially items which affect the physical position of text
on a formatted page. In addition to the page structure
domain, there are two more domains, the manual domain and
the general text domain. The general text domain is defined
as macros which perform tasks such as quoting or emphasizing
pieces of text. The manual domain is defined as macros that
are a subset of the day to day informal language used to
describe commands, routines and related UNIX files. Macros
in the manual domain handle command names, command line
arguments and options, function names, function parameters,
pathnames, variables, cross references to other manual
pages, and so on. These domain items have value for both the
author and the future user of the manual page. Hope- fully,
the consistency gained across the manual set will provide
easier translation to future documentation tools.</p>

<p>Throughout the UNIX manual pages, a manual entry is
simply referred to as a man page, regardless of actual
length and without sexist intention.</p>

<p>TROFF IDIOSYNCRASIES The -mdoc package attempts to
simplify the process of writing a man page. Theoretically,
one should not have to learn the tricky details of GNU
troff(1) to use -mdoc; however, there are a few limitations
which are unavoidable and best gotten out of the way. And,
too, be forewarned, this package is not fast.</p>

<p>Macro Usage As in GNU troff(1), a macro is called by
placing a . (dot character) at the beginning of a line
followed by the two-character (or three-charac- ter) name
for the macro. There can be space or tab characters between
the dot and the macro name. Arguments may follow the macro
separated by spaces (but no tabs). It is the dot character
at the beginning of the line which causes GNU troff(1) to
interpret the next two (or more) char- acters as a macro
name. A single starting dot followed by nothing is ignored.
To place a . (dot character) at the beginning of an input
line in some context other than a macro invocation, precede
the . (dot) with the escape sequence which translates
literally to a zero-width space, and is never displayed in
the output.</p>

<p>In general, GNU troff(1) macros accept an unlimited
number of arguments (contrary to other versions of troff
which cant handle more than nine arguments). In limited
cases, arguments may be continued or extended on the next
line (See Extended Arguments below). Almost all macros
handle quoted arguments (see Passing Space Characters in an
Argument below).</p>

<p>Most of the -mdoc general text domain and manual domain
macros are spe- cial in that their argument lists are parsed
for callable macro names. This means an argument on the
argument list which matches a general text or manual domain
macro name (and which is defined to be callable) will be
executed or called when it is processed. In this case the
argument, although the name of a macro, is not preceded by a
. (dot). This makes it possible to nest macros; for example
the option macro, .Op, may call the flag and argument
macros, Fl and Ar, to specify an optional flag with an
argument:</p>

<p>[-s bytes] is produced by .Op Fl s Ar bytes</p>

<p>To prevent a string from being interpreted as a macro
name, precede the string with the escape sequence :</p>

<p>[Fl s Ar bytes] is produced by .Op Fl s Ar bytes</p>

<p>Here the strings Fl and Ar are not interpreted as
macros. Macros whose argument lists are parsed for callable
arguments are referred to as parsed and macros which may be
called from an argument list are referred to as callable
throughout this document. This is a technical faux pas as
almost all of the macros in -mdoc are parsed, but as it was
cumbersome to constantly refer to macros as being callable
and being able to call other macros, the term parsed has
been used.</p>

<p>In the following, we call an -mdoc macro which starts a
line (with a leading dot) a command if this distinction is
necessary.</p>

<p>Passing Space Characters in an Argument Sometimes it is
desirable to give as an argument a string containing one or
more blank space characters, say, to specify arguments to
commands which expect particular arrangement of items in the
argument list. Addi- tionally, it makes -mdoc working
faster. For example, the function com- mand .Fn expects the
first argument to be the name of a function and any
remaining arguments to be function parameters. As ANSI C
stipulates the declaration of function parameters in the
parenthesized parameter list, each parameter is guaranteed
to be at minimum a two word string. For example, int
foo.</p>

<p>There are two possible ways to pass an argument which
contains an embed- ded space. One way of passing a string
containing blank spaces is to use the hard or unpaddable
space character , that is, a blank space pre- ceded by the
escape character . This method may be used with any macro
but has the side effect of interfering with the adjustment
of text over the length of a line. Troff sees the hard space
as if it were any other printable character and cannot split
the string into blank or new- line separated pieces as one
would expect. This method is useful for strings which are
not expected to overlap a line boundary. An alterna- tive is
to use , a paddable (i.e. stretchable), unbreakable space
(this is a GNU troff(1) extension). The second method is to
enclose the string with double quotes.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>fetch(char *str) is created by .Fn fetch char *str</p>

<p>fetch(char *str) can also be created by .Fn fetch
&quot;char *str&quot;</p>

<p>If the before the space in the first example or double
quotes in the second example were omitted, .Fn would see
three arguments, and the result would be:</p>

<p>fetch(char, *str)</p>

<p>Trailing Blank Space Characters Troff can be confused by
blank space characters at the end of a line. It is a wise
preventive measure to globally remove all blank spaces from
blank-spaceend-of-line character sequences. Should the need
arise to use a blank character at the end of a line, it may
be forced with an unpaddable space and the escape character.
For example, string .</p>

<p>Escaping Special Characters are handled by replac-
Special characters like the newline character 0 ing the with
\ (e.g. \n) to preserve the backslash.</p>

<p>Other Possible Pitfalls A warning is emitted when an
empty input line is found outside of dis- plays (see below).
Use .sp instead. (Well, it is even better to use -mdoc
macros to avoid the usage of low-level commands.)</p>

<p>Leading spaces will cause a break and are output
directly. Avoid this behaviour if possible. Similarly, do
not use more than one space charac- ter between words in an
ordinary text line; contrary to other text for- matters,
they are not replaced with a single space.</p>

<p>You cant pass &quot; directly as an argument. Use (or )
instead.</p>

<p>By default, troff(1) inserts two space characters after
a punctuation mark closing a sentence; characters like ) or
are treated transpar- ently, not influencing the
sentence-ending behaviour. To change this, insert before or
after the dot:</p>

<p>The .Ql . character. .Pp The .Ql . character. .Pp .No
test . test .Pp .No test. test</p>

<p>gives</p>

<p>The . character</p>

<p>The . character.</p>

<p>test. test</p>

<p>test. test</p>

<p>As can be seen in the first and third line, -mdoc
handles punctuation characters specially in macro arguments.
This will be explained in sec- tion General Syntax below. In
the same way, you have to protect trailing full stops of
abbreviations with a trailing zero-width space: e.g..</p>

<p>A comment in the source file of a man page can be either
started with . ter is a GNU troff(1) extension); the rest of
such a line is ignored.</p>

<p>A MANUAL PAGE TEMPLATE The body of a man page is easily
constructed from a basic template:</p>

<p>. .Dd Month day, year .Os [OPERATING_SYSTEM]
[version/release] .Dt DOCUMENT_TITLE [section number]
[architecture/volume] .Sh NAME .Nm name .Nd one line
description of name . . .Sh SYNOPSIS .Sh DESCRIPTION . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>The first items in the template are the commands .Dd,
.Os, and .Dt; the document date, the operating system the
man page or subject source is developed or modified for, and
the man page title (in upper case) along with the section of
the manual the page belongs in. These commands iden- tify
the page and are discussed below in TITLE MACROS.</p>

<p>The remaining items in the template are section headers
(.Sh); of which NAME, SYNOPSIS, and DESCRIPTION are
mandatory. The headers are discussed in PAGE STRUCTURE
DOMAIN, after presentation of MANUAL DOMAIN. Several content
macros are used to demonstrate page layout macros; reading
about content macros before page layout macros is
recommended.</p>

<p>CONVENTIONS In the description of all macros below,
optional arguments are put into brackets. An ellipsis ( ...
) represents zero or more additional argu- ments.
Alternative values for a parameter are separated with |. If
there are alternative values for a mandatory parameter,
braces are used (together with |) to enclose the value set.
Meta-variables are speci- fied within angles.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>.Xx foo {bar1 | bar2} [-test1 [-test2 | -test3]] ...</p>

<p>Except stated explicitly, all macros are parsed and
callable.</p>

<p>Note that a macro takes effect up to the next nested
macro. For example, .Ic foo Aq bar doesnt produce foo
&lt;bar&gt; but foo bar. Conse- quently, a warning message
is emitted for most commands if the first argument is a
macro itself since it cancels the effect of the calling
command completely. Another consequence is that quoting
macros never insert literal quotes; foo &lt;bar&gt; has been
produced by .Ic &quot;foo &lt;bar&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>Most macros have a default width value which can be used
to specify a label width (-width) or offset (-offset) for
the .Bl and .Bd macros. It is recommended not to use this
rather obscure feature to avoid depen- dencies on local
modifications of the -mdoc package.</p>

<p>TITLE MACROS The title macros are part of the page
structure domain but are presented first and separately for
someone who wishes to start writing a man page yesterday.
Three header macros designate the document title or manual
page title, the operating system, and the date of
authorship. These macros are called once at the very
beginning of the document and are used to construct headers
and footers only.</p>

<p>.Dt [document title] [section number] [volume] The
document title is the subject of the man page and must be in
CAPITALS due to troff limitations. If omitted, UNTITLED is
used. The section number may be a number in the range 1,
..., 9 or unass, draft, or paper. If it is specified, and no
vol- ume name is given, a default volume name is used.</p>

<p>Under BSD, the following sections are defined:</p>

<p>1 BSD General Commands Manual 2 BSD System Calls Manual
3 BSD Library Functions Manual 4 BSD Kernel Interfaces
Manual 5 BSD File Formats Manual 6 BSD Games Manual 7 BSD
Miscellaneous Information Manual 8 BSD System Managers
Manual 9 BSD Kernel Developers Manual</p>

<p>A volume name may be arbitrary or one of the
following:</p>

<p>USD Users Supplementary Documents PS1 Programmers
Supplementary Documents AMD Ancestral Manual Documents SMM
System Managers Manual URM Users Reference Manual PRM
Programmers Manual KM Kernel Manual IND Manual Master Index
LOCAL Local Manual CON Contributed Software Manual</p>

<p>For compatibility, MMI can be used for IND, and LOC for
LOCAL . Values from the previous table will specify a new
vol- ume name. If the third parameter is a keyword
designating a com- puter architecture, its value is
prepended to the default volume name as specified by the
second parameter. By default, the fol- lowing architecture
keywords are defined:</p>

<p>alpha, amiga, arc, arm26, arm32, atari, bebox, cobalt,
evbsh3, hp300, hpcmips, i386, luna68k, m68k, mac68k, macppc,
mips, mmeye, mvme68k, news68k, newsmips, next68k, ofppc,
pc532, pmax, powerpc, prep, sgimips, sh3, sparc, sparc64,
sun3, tahoe, vax, x68k</p>

<p>In the following examples, the left (which is identical
to the right) and the middle part of the manual page header
strings are shown.</p>

<p>.Dt FOO 7 FOO(7) BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual
.Dt FOO 2 i386 FOO(2) BSD/i386 System Calls Manual .Dt FOO
&quot;&quot; bar FOO bar</p>

<p>Local, OS-specific additions might be found in the file
mdoc.local; look for strings named volume-ds-XXX (for the
for- mer type) and volume-as-XXX (for the latter type); XXX
then denotes the keyword to be used with the .Dt macro.</p>

<p>This macro is neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>.Os [operating system] [release] If the first parameter
is empty, the default BSD is used. This may be overridden in
the local configuration file, mdoc.local. In general, the
name of the operating system should be the common acronym,
e.g. BSD or ATT. The release should be the standard release
nomenclature for the system specified. In the following
table, the possible second arguments for some predefined
operat- ing systems are listed. Similar to .Dt , local
additions might be defined in mdoc.local; look for strings
named operating-system-XXX-YYY , where XXX is the acronym
for the operating system and YYY the release ID.</p>

<p>ATT 7th, 7, III, 3, V, V.2, V.3, V.4</p>

<p>BSD 3, 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.3t, 4.3T, 4.3r, 4.3R, 4.4</p>

<p>NetBSD 0.8, 0.8a, 0.9, 0.9a, 1.0, 1.0a, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2a,
1.2b, 1.2c, 1.2d, 1.2e, 1.3, 1.3a, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6</p>

<p>FreeBSD 1.0, 1.1, 1.1.5, 1.1.5.1, 2.0, 2.0.5, 2.1,
2.1.5, 2.1.6, 2.1.7, 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.6, 2.2.7,
2.2.8, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
4.4, 4.5, 5.0</p>

<p>For ATT, an unknown second parameter will be replaced
with the string UNIX; for the other predefined acronyms it
will be ignored and a warning message emitted. Unrecognized
arguments are dis- played as given in the page footer. For
instance, a typical footer might be:</p>

<p>.Os BSD 4.3</p>

<p>giving 4.3 Berkeley Distribution, or for a locally
produced set</p>

<p>.Os CS Department</p>

<p>which will produce CS Department.</p>

<p>If the .Os macro is not present, the bottom left corner
of the manual page will be ugly.</p>

<p>This macro is neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>.Dd [month day, year] If Dd has no arguments, Epoch is
used for the date string. If it has exactly three arguments,
they are concatenated, sepa- rated with unbreakable
space:</p>

<p>.Dd January 25, 2001</p>

<p>Otherwise, the current date is used, ignoring the
parameters.</p>

<p>This macro is neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION OF MANUAL AND GENERAL TEXT DOMAINS Whas in
a Name... The manual domain macro names are derived from the
day to day informal language used to describe commands,
subroutines and related files. Slightly different variations
of this language are used to describe the three different
aspects of writing a man page. First, there is the
description of -mdoc macro command usage. Second is the
description of a UNIX command with -mdoc macros, and third,
the description of a command to a user in the verbal sense;
that is, discussion of a command in the text of a man
page.</p>

<p>In the first case, troff(1) macros are themselves a type
of command; the general syntax for a troff command is:</p>

<p>.Xx argument1 argument2 ...</p>

<p>.Xx is a macro command, and anything following it are
arguments to be processed. In the second case, the
description of a UNIX command using the content macros is a
bit more involved; a typical SYNOPSIS command line might be
displayed as:</p>

<p>filter [-flag] infile outfile</p>

<p>Here, filter is the command name and the bracketed
string -flag is a flag argument designated as optional by
the option brackets. In -mdoc terms, infile and outfile are
called meta arguments; in this example, the user has to
replace the meta expressions given in angle brackets with
real file names. Note that in this document meta arguments
are used to describe -mdoc commands; in most man pages, meta
variables are not specifically written with angle brackets.
The macros which formatted the above example:</p>

<p>.Nm filter .Op Fl flag .Ao Ar infile Ac Ao Ar outfile
Ac</p>

<p>In the third case, discussion of commands and command
syntax includes both examples above, but may add more
detail. The arguments infile and outfile from the example
above might be referred to as operands or file arguments.
Some command line argument lists are quite long:</p>

<p>make [-eiknqrstv] [-D variable] [-d flags] [-f makefile]
[-I directory] [-j max_jobs] [variable=value] [target
...]</p>

<p>Here one might talk about the command make and qualify
the argument, makefile, as an argument to the flag, -f, or
discuss the optional file operand target. In the verbal
context, such detail can prevent confu- sion, however the
-mdoc package does not have a macro for an argument to a
flag. Instead the Ar argument macro is used for an operand
or file argument like target as well as an argument to a
flag like variable. The make command line was produced
from:</p>

<p>.Nm make .Op Fl eiknqrstv .Op Fl D Ar variable .Op Fl d
Ar flags .Op Fl f Ar makefile .Op Fl I Ar directory .Op Fl j
Ar max_jobs .Op Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value .Bk .Op Ar
target ... .Ek</p>

<p>The .Bk and .Ek macros are explained in Keeps.</p>

<p>General Syntax The manual domain and general text domain
macros share a similar syntax with a few minor deviations;
most notably, .Ar, .Fl, .Nm , and .Pa differ only when
called without arguments; and .Fn and .Xr impose an order on
their argument lists. All content macros are capable of
recog- nizing and properly handling punctuation, provided
each punctuation char- acter is separated by a leading
space. If a command is given:</p>

<p>.Ar sptr, ptr),</p>

<p>The result is:</p>

<p>sptr, ptr),</p>

<p>The punctuation is not recognized and all is output in
the font used by .Ar. If the punctuation is separated by a
leading white space:</p>

<p>.Ar sptr , ptr ) ,</p>

<p>The result is:</p>

<p>sptr, ptr),</p>

<p>The punctuation is now recognized and output in the
default font distin- guishing it from the argument strings.
To remove the special meaning from a punctuation character
escape it with .</p>

<p>Troff is limited as a macro language, and has difficulty
when presented with a string containing a member of the
mathematical, logical or quota- tion set:</p>


<p>{+,-,/,*,%,&lt;,&gt;,&lt;=,&gt;=,=,==,&amp;,,,&quot;}</p>

<p>The problem is that troff may assume it is supposed to
actually perform the operation or evaluation suggested by
the characters. To prevent the accidental evaluation of
these characters, escape them with . Typi- cal syntax is
shown in the first content macro displayed below, .Ad.</p>

<p>MANUAL DOMAIN Addresses The address macro identifies an
address construct.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ad address ...</p>

<p>.Ad addr1 addr1 .Ad addr1 . addr1. .Ad addr1 , file2
addr1, file2 .Ad f1 , f2 , f3 : f1, f2, f3: .Ad addr ) ) ,
addr)),</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Author Name The .An macro is used to specify the name of
the author of the item being documented, or the name of the
author of the actual manual page.</p>

<p>Usage: .An author name ...</p>

<p>.An &quot;Joe Author&quot; Joe Author</p>

<p>.An &quot;Joe Author&quot; , Joe Author,</p>

<p>.An &quot;Joe Author&quot; Aq nobody@FreeBSD.org Joe
Author nobody@FreeBSD.org</p>

<p>.An &quot;Joe Author&quot; ) ) , Joe Author)),</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>In the AUTHORS section, the .An command causes a line
break allowing each new name to appear on its own line. If
this is not desirable,</p>

<p>.An -nosplit</p>

<p>call will turn this off. To turn splitting back on,
write</p>

<p>.An -split</p>

<p>Arguments The .Ar argument macro may be used whenever an
argument is referenced. If called without arguments, the
file ... string is output.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ar [argument] ...</p>

<p>.Ar file ... .Ar file1 file1 .Ar file1 . file1. .Ar
file1 file2 file1 file2 .Ar f1 f2 f3 : f1 f2 f3: .Ar file )
) , file)),</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Configuration Declaration (Section Four Only) The .Cd
macro is used to demonstrate a config(8) declaration for a
device interface in a section four manual.</p>

<p>Usage: .Cd argument ...</p>

<p>.Cd &quot;device le0 at scode?&quot; device le0 at
scode?</p>

<p>In the SYNOPSIS section a .Cd command causes a line
break before and after its arguments are printed.</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Command Modifiers The command modifier is identical to
the .Fl (flag) command with the exception that the .Cm macro
does not assert a dash in front of every argument.
Traditionally flags are marked by the preceding dash,
however, some commands or subsets of commands do not use
them. Command modifiers may also be specified in conjunction
with interactive commands such as editor commands. See
Flags.</p>

<p>The default width is 10n.</p>

<p>Defined Variables A variable (or constant) which is
defined in an include file is specified by the macro
.Dv.</p>

<p>Usage: .Dv defined variable ...</p>

<p>.Dv MAXHOSTNAMELEN MAXHOSTNAMELEN .Dv TIOCGPGRP )
TIOCGPGRP)</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Errns The .Er errno macro specifies the error return
value for section 2, 3, and 9 library routines. The second
example below shows .Er used with the .Bq general text
domain macro, as it would be used in a section two manual
page.</p>

<p>Usage: .Er errno type ...</p>

<p>.Er ENOENT ENOENT .Er ENOENT ) ; ENOENT); .Bq Er ENOTDIR
[ENOTDIR]</p>

<p>The default width is 17n.</p>

<p>Environment Variables The .Ev macro specifies an
environment variable.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ev argument ...</p>

<p>.Ev DISPLAY DISPLAY .Ev PATH . PATH. .Ev PRINTER ) ) ,
PRINTER)),</p>

<p>The default width is 15n.</p>

<p>Flags The .Fl macro handles command line flags. It
prepends a dash, -, to the flag. For interactive command
flags, which are not prepended with a dash, the .Cm (command
modifier) macro is identical, but without the dash.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fl argument ...</p>

<p>.Fl - .Fl cfv -cfv .Fl cfv . -cfv. .Cm cfv . cfv. .Fl s
v t -s -v -t .Fl - , --, .Fl xyz ) , -xyz), .Fl | - |</p>

<p>The .Fl macro without any arguments results in a dash
representing stdin/stdout. Note that giving .Fl a single
dash will result in two dashes.</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Function Declarations The .Fd macro is used in the
SYNOPSIS section with section two or three functions. It is
neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fd argument ...</p>

<p>.Fd &quot;#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;&quot; #include
&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</p>

<p>In the SYNOPSIS section a .Fd command causes a line
break if a function has already been presented and a break
has not occurred. This leaves a nice vertical space in
between the previous function call and the decla- ration for
the next function.</p>

<p>The .In (#include statement) macro is the short form of
the above exam- ple. It specifies the C header file as being
included in a C program. It also causes a line break, and is
neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>Usage: .In header file</p>

<p>.In stdio.h #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>Function Types This macro is intended for the SYNOPSIS
section. It may be used anywhere else in the man page
without problems, but its main purpose is to present the
function type in kernel normal form for the SYNOPSIS of
sections two and three (it causes a line break, allowing the
function name to appear on the next line).</p>

<p>Usage: .Ft type ...</p>

<p>.Ft struct stat struct stat</p>

<p>Functions (Library Routines) The .Fn macro is modeled on
ANSI C conventions.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fn function [parameter] ...</p>

<p>.Fn getchar getchar() .Fn strlen ) , strlen()), .Fn
align &quot;char *ptr&quot; , align(char *ptr),</p>

<p>Note that any call to another macro signals the end of
the .Fn call (it will insert a closing parenthesis at that
point).</p>

<p>For functions with many parameters (which is rare), the
macros .Fo (function open) and .Fc (function close) may be
used with .Fa (func- tion argument).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>.Ft int .Fo res_mkquery .Fa &quot;int op&quot; .Fa
&quot;char *dname&quot; .Fa &quot;int class&quot; .Fa
&quot;int type&quot; .Fa &quot;char *data&quot; .Fa
&quot;int datalen&quot; .Fa &quot;struct rrec *newrr&quot;
.Fa &quot;char *buf&quot; .Fa &quot;int buflen&quot; .Fc</p>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p>int res_mkquery(int op, char *dname, int class, int
type, char *data, int datalen, struct rrec *newrr, char
*buf, int buflen)</p>

<p>In the SYNOPSIS section, the function will always begin
at the beginning of line. If there is more than one function
presented in the SYNOPSIS section and a function type has
not been given, a line break will occur, leaving a nice
vertical space between the current function name and the one
prior.</p>

<p>The default width values of .Fn and .Fo are 12n and 16n,
respec- tively.</p>

<p>Function Arguments The .Fa macro is used to refer to
function arguments (parameters) out- side of the SYNOPSIS
section of the manual or inside the SYNOPSIS section if the
enclosure macros .Fo and .Fc instead of .Fn are used. .Fa
may also be used to refer to structure members.</p>

<p>Usage: .Fa function argument ...</p>

<p>.Fa d_namlen ) ) , d_namlen)), .Fa iov_len iov_len</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Return Values The .Rv macro generates text for use in
the RETURN VALUES section.</p>

<p>Usage: .Rv [-std] [function ...]</p>

<p>For example, .Rv -std atexit produces:</p>

<p>The atexit() function returns the value 0 if successful;
otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable
errno is set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The -std option is valid only for manual page sections 2
and 3. Cur- rently, this macro does nothing if used without
the -std flag.</p>

<p>Exit Status The .Ex macro generates text for use in the
DIAGNOSTICS section.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ex [-std] [utility ...]</p>

<p>For example, .Ex -std cat produces:</p>

<p>The cat utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an
error occurs.</p>

<p>The -std option is valid only for manual page sections
1, 6 and 8. Cur- rently, this macro does nothing if used
without the -std flag.</p>

<p>Interactive Commands The .Ic macro designates an
interactive or internal command.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ic argument ...</p>

<p>.Ic :wq :wq .Ic &quot;do while {...}&quot; do while
{...} .Ic setenv , unsetenv setenv, unsetenv</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Library Names The .Lb macro is used to specify the
library where a particular func- tion is compiled in.</p>

<p>Usage: .Lb argument ...</p>

<p>Available arguments to .Lb and their results are:</p>

<p>libarm32 ARM32 Architecture Library (libarm32, -larm32)
libc Standard C Library (libc, -lc) libcompat Compatibility
Library (libcompat, -lcompat) libcrypt Crypt Library
(libcrypt, -lcrypt) libcurses Curses Library (libcurses,
-lcurses) libedit Command Line Editor Library (libedit,
-ledit) libi386 i386 Architecture Library (libi386, -li386)
libipsec IPsec Policy Control Library (libipsec, -lipsec)
libkvm Kernel Data Access Library (libkvm, -lkvm) libm Math
Library (libm, -lm) libmenu Curses Menu Library (libmenu,
-lmenu) libossaudio OSS Audio Emulation Library
(libossaudio, -lossaudio) libposix POSIX Compatibility
Library (libposix, -lposix) libresolv DNS Resolver Library
(libresolv, -lresolv) libtermcap Termcap Access Library
(libtermcap, -ltermcap) libutil System Utilities Library
(libutil, -lutil) libz Compression Library (libz, -lz)</p>

<p>Local, OS-specific additions might be found in the file
mdoc.local; look for strings named str-Lb-XXX. XXX then
denotes the keyword to be used with the .Lb macro.</p>

<p>Literals The .Li literal macro may be used for special
characters, variable con- stants, etc. -- anything which
should be displayed as it would be typed.</p>

<p>Usage: .Li argument ...</p>

<p>.Li \n .Li M1 M2 M3 ; M1 M2 M3; .Li cntrl-D ) ,
cntrl-D), .Li 1024 ... 1024 ...</p>

<p>The default width is 16n.</p>

<p>Names The .Nm macro is used for the document title or
subject name. It has the peculiarity of remembering the
first argument it was called with, which should always be
the subject name of the page. When called without arguments,
.Nm regurgitates this initial name for the sole purpose of
making less work for the author. Note: A section two or
three document function name is addressed with the .Nm in
the NAME section, and with .Fn in the SYNOPSIS and remaining
sections. For interactive commands, such as the while
command keyword in csh(1), the .Ic macro should be used.
While .Ic is nearly identical to .Nm , it can not recall the
first argument it was invoked with.</p>

<p>Usage: .Nm [argument] ...</p>

<p>.Nm groff_mdoc groff_mdoc .Nm &minus;mdoc -mdoc .Nm foo
) ) , foo)), .Nm : groff_mdoc:</p>

<p>The default width is 10n.</p>

<p>Options The .Op macro places option brackets around any
remaining arguments on the command line, and places any
trailing punctuation outside the brack- ets. The macros .Oo
and .Oc (which produce an opening and a closing option
bracket respectively) may be used across one or more lines
or to specify the exact position of the closing
parenthesis.</p>

<p>Usage: .Op [option] ...</p>

<p>.Op [] .Op Fl k [-k] .Op Fl k ) . [-k]). .Op Fl k Ar
kookfile [-k kookfile] .Op Fl k Ar kookfile , [-k kookfile],
.Op Ar objfil Op Ar corfil [objfil [corfil]] .Op Fl c Ar
objfil Op Ar corfil , [-c objfil [corfil]], .Op word1 word2
[word1 word2] .Li .Op Oo Ao option Ac Oc ... .Op [ options]
...</p>

<p>Here a typical example of the .Oo and .Oc macros:</p>

<p>.Oo .Op Fl k Ar kilobytes .Op Fl i Ar interval .Op Fl c
Ar count .Oc</p>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p>[[-k kilobytes] [-i interval] [-c count]]</p>

<p>The default width values of .Op and .Oo are 14n and 10n,
respec- tively.</p>

<p>Pathnames The .Pa macro formats path or file names. If
called without arguments, the ~ string is output, which
represents the current users home direc- tory.</p>

<p>Usage: .Pa [pathname] ...</p>

<p>.Pa ~ .Pa /usr/share /usr/share .Pa /tmp/fooXXXXX ) .
/tmp/fooXXXXX).</p>

<p>The default width is 32n.</p>

<p>Standards The .St macro replaces standard abbreviations
with their formal names.</p>

<p>Usage: .St abbreviation ...</p>

<p>Available pairs for Abbreviation/Formal Name are:</p>

<p>Variable Types The .Vt macro may be used whenever a type
is referenced. In the SYNOPSIS section, it causes a line
break (useful for old style variable declarations).</p>

<p>Usage: .Vt type ...</p>

<p>.Vt extern char *optarg ; extern char *optarg; .Vt FILE
* FILE *</p>

<p>Variables Generic variable reference.</p>

<p>Usage: .Va variable ...</p>

<p>.Va count count .Va settimer , settimer, .Va &quot;int

char s])),</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>Manual Page Cross References The .Xr macro expects the
first argument to be a manual page name. The optional second
argument, if a string (defining the manual section), is put
into parentheses.</p>

<p>Usage: .Xr man page name [section] ...</p>

<p>.Xr mdoc mdoc .Xr mdoc , mdoc, .Xr mdoc 7 mdoc(7) .Xr
xinit 1x ; xinit(1x);</p>

<p>The default width is 10n.</p>

<p>GENERAL TEXT DOMAIN AT&amp;T Macro Usage: .At [version]
...</p>

<p>.At AT&amp;T UNIX .At v6 . Version 6 AT&amp;T UNIX.</p>

<p>The following values for version are possible:</p>

<p>32v, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, V, V.1, V.2, V.3,
V.4</p>

<p>BSD Macro Usage: .Bx {-alpha | -beta | -devel} ... .Bx

<p>.Bx BSD .Bx 4.3 . 4.3BSD. .Bx -devel BSD (currently
under development)</p>

<p>version will be prepended to the string BSD. The
following values for release are possible:</p>

<p>Reno, reno, Tahoe, tahoe, Lite, lite, Lite2, lite2</p>

<p>NetBSD Macro Usage: .Nx [version] ...</p>

<p>.Nx NetBSD .Nx 1.4 . NetBSD 1.4.</p>

<p>.Bsx 1.0 BSD/OS 1.0</p>

<p>UNIX Macro Usage: .Ux ...</p>

<p>.Ux UNIX</p>

<p>Emphasis Macro Text may be stressed or emphasized with
the .Em macro. The usual font for emphasis is italic.</p>

<p>Usage: .Em argument ...</p>

<p>.Em does not does not .Em exceed 1024 . exceed 1024. .Em
vide infra ) ) , vide infra)),</p>

<p>The default width is 10n.</p>

<p>Font Mode The .Bf font mode must be ended with the .Ef
macro (the latter takes no arguments). Font modes may be
nested within other font modes.</p>

<p>.Bf has the following syntax:</p>

<p>.Bf font mode</p>

<p>font mode must be one of the following three types:</p>

<p>Em | -emphasis Same as if the .Em macro was used for the
entire block of text. Li | -literal Same as if the .Li macro
was used for the entire block of text. Sy | -symbolic Same
as if the .Sy macro was used for the entire block of
text.</p>

<p>Both macros are neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>Enclosure and Quoting Macros The concept of enclosure is
similar to quoting. The object being to enclose one or more
strings between a pair of characters like quotes or
parentheses. The terms quoting and enclosure are used
interchangeably throughout this document. Most of the
one-line enclosure macros end in small letter q to give a
hint of quoting, but there are a few irregu- larities. For
each enclosure macro there is also a pair of open and close
macros which end in small letters o and c respectively.</p>

<p>Quote Open Close Function Result .Aq .Ao .Ac Angle
Bracket Enclosure string .Bq .Bo .Bc Bracket Enclosure
[string] .Brq .Bro .Brc Brace Enclosure {string} .Dq .Do .Dc
Double Quote string .Eq .Eo .Ec Enclose String (in XX)
XXstringXX .Pq .Po .Pc Parenthesis Enclosure (string) .Ql
Quoted Literal string or string .Qq .Qo .Qc Straight Double
Quote &quot;string&quot; .Sq .So .Sc Single Quote string</p>

<p>All macros ending with q and o have a default width
value of 12n.</p>

<p>.Eo, .Ec These macros expect the first argument to be
the opening and closing strings respectively.</p>

<p>.Es, .En Due to the nine-argument limit in the original
troff program two other macros have been implemented which
are now rather obsolete: .Es takes the first and second
parameter as the left and right enclosure string, which are
then used to enclose the arguments of .En. The default width
value is 12n for both macros.</p>

<p>.Eq The first and second arguments of this macro are the
opening and closing strings respectively, followed by the
arguments to be enclosed.</p>

<p>.Ql The quoted literal macro behaves differently in
troff and nroff mode. If formatted with nroff, a quoted
literal is always quoted. If formatted with troff, an item
is only quoted if the width of the item is less than three
constant width characters. This is to make short strings
more visible where the font change to literal (constant
width) is less noticeable.</p>

<p>The default width is 16n.</p>

<p>.Pf The prefix macro suppresses the whitespace between
its first and second argument:</p>

<p>.Pf ( Fa name2 (name2</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>The .Ns macro (see below) performs the analogous suffix
func- tion.</p>

<p>.Ap The .Ap macro inserts an apostrophe and exits any
special text modes, continuing in .No mode.</p>

<p>Examples of quoting:</p>

<p>.Aq .Aq Pa ctype.h ) , ctype.h), .Bq [] .Bq Em Greek ,
French . [Greek, French]. .Dq .Dq string abc . string abc.
.Dq &acute;^[A-Z]&acute; &acute;^[A-Z]&acute; .Ql man mdoc
man mdoc .Qq &quot;&quot; .Qq string ) ,
&quot;string&quot;), .Qq string Ns ), &quot;string),&quot;
.Sq .Sq string string .Em or Ap ing oring</p>

<p>For a good example of nested enclosure macros, see the
.Op option macro. It was created from the same underlying
enclosure macros as those presented in the list above. The
.Xo and .Xc extended argument list macros are discussed
below.</p>

<p>No-Op or Normal Text Macro The .No macro can be used in
a macro command line for parameters which should not be
formatted. Be careful to add to the word No if you really
want that English word (and not the macro) as a
parameter.</p>

<p>Usage: .No argument ...</p>

<p>.No test Ta with Ta tabs test with tabs</p>

<p>The default width is 12n.</p>

<p>No-Space Macro The .Ns macro suppresses insertion of a
space between the current posi- tion and its first
parameter. For example, it is useful for old style argument
lists where there is no space between the flag and
argument:</p>

<p>Usage: ... argument Ns [argument] ... .Ns argument
...</p>

<p>.Op Fl I Ns Ar directory [-Idirectory]</p>

<p>Note: The .Ns macro always invokes the .No macro after
eliminating the space unless another macro name follows it.
If used as a command (i.e., the second form above in the
Usage line), .Ns is identical to .No.</p>

<p>Section Cross References The .Sx macro designates a
reference to a section header within the same document.</p>

<p>Usage: .Sx section reference ...</p>

<p>.Sx FILES FILES</p>

<p>The default width is 16n.</p>

<p>Symbolics The symbolic emphasis macro is generally a
boldface macro in either the symbolic sense or the
traditional English usage.</p>

<p>Usage: .Sy symbol ...</p>

<p>.Sy Important Notice Important Notice</p>

<p>The default width is 6n.</p>

<p>Mathematical Symbols Use this macro for mathematical
symbols and similar things.</p>

<p>Usage: .Ms math symbol ...</p>

<p>.Ms sigma sigma</p>

<p>The default width is 6n.</p>

<p>References and Citations The following macros make a
modest attempt to handle references. At best, the macros
make it convenient to manually drop in a subset of refer(1)
style references.</p>

<p>.Rs Reference start (does not take arguments). Causes a
line break in the SEE ALSO section and begins collection of
ref- erence information until the reference end macro is
read. .Re Reference end (does not take arguments). The
reference is printed. .%A Reference author name; one name
per invocation. .%B Book title. .%C City/place (not
implemented yet). .%D Date. .%I Issuer/publisher name. .%J
Journal name. .%N Issue number. .%O Optional information.
.%P Page number. .%Q Corporate or foreign author. .%R Report
name. .%T Title of article. .%V Volume.</p>

<p>Macros beginning with % are not callable but accept
multiple arguments in the usual way. Only the .Tn macro is
handled properly as a parame- ter; other macros will cause
strange output. .%B and .%T can be used outside of the
.Rs/.Re environment.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>.Rs .%A &quot;Matthew Bar&quot; .%A &quot;John Foo&quot;
.%T &quot;Implementation Notes on foobar(1)&quot; .%R
&quot;Technical Report ABC-DE-12-345&quot; .%Q

<p>produces</p>

<p>Matthew Bar and John Foo, Implementation Notes on
foobar(1), Technical Report ABC-DE-12-345, Drofnats College,
Nowhere, April 1991.</p>

<p>Trade Names (or Acronyms and Type Names) The trade name
macro prints its arguments in a smaller font. Its intended
use is to imitate a small caps fonts for uppercase
acronyms.</p>

<p>Usage: .Tn symbol ...</p>

<p>.Tn DEC DEC .Tn ASCII ASCII</p>

<p>The default width is 10n.</p>

<p>Extended Arguments The .Xo and .Xc macros allow one to
extend an argument list on a macro boundary for the .It
macro (see below). Note that .Xo and .Xc are implemented
similarly to all other macros opening and closing an enclo-
sure (without inserting characters, of course). This means
that the fol- lowing is true for those macros also.</p>

<p>Here is an example of .Xo using the space mode macro to
turn spacing off:</p>

<p>.Sm off .It Xo Sy I Ar operation .No \n Ar count No \n
.Xc .Sm on</p>

<p>produces</p>

<p>Ioperationcount</p>

<p>Another one:</p>

<p>.Sm off .It Cm S No / Ar old_pattern Xo .No / Ar
new_pattern .No / Op Cm g .Xc .Sm on</p>

<p>produces</p>

<p>S/old_pattern/new_pattern/[g]</p>

<p>Another example of .Xo and enclosure macros: Test the
value of a vari- able.</p>

<p>.It Xo .Ic .ifndef .Oo ! Oc Ns Ar variable Oo .Ar
operator variable ... .Oc Xc</p>

<p>produces</p>

<p>.ifndef [!]variable [operator variable ...]</p>

<p>PAGE STRUCTURE DOMAIN Section Headers The following .Sh
section header macros are required in every man page. The
remaining section headers are recommended at the discretion
of the author writing the manual page. The .Sh macro is
parsed but not gener- ally callable. It can be used as an
argument in a call to .Sh only; it then reactivates the
default font for .Sh.</p>

<p>The default width is 8n.</p>

<p>.Sh NAME The .Sh NAME macro is mandatory. If not
specified, headers, footers and page layout defaults will
not be set and things will be rather unpleasant. The NAME
section consists of at least three items. The first is the
.Nm name macro naming the subject of the man page. The
second is the name description macro, .Nd, which separates
the subject name from the third item, which is the
description. The description should be the most terse and
lucid possible, as the space available is small.</p>

<p>.Nd first prints - , then all its arguments.</p>

<p>.Sh LIBRARY This section is for section two and three
function calls. It should consist of a single .Lb macro
call; see Library Names.</p>

<p>.Sh SYNOPSIS The SYNOPSIS section describes the typical
usage of the subject of a man page. The macros required are
either .Nm, .Cd, or .Fn (and possibly .Fo , .Fc , .Fd, and
.Ft). The function name macro .Fn is required for manual
page sections 2 and 3; the command and general name macro
.Nm is required for sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Section 4
manuals require a .Nm, .Fd or a .Cd configuration device
usage macro. Several other macros may be necessary to
produce the synopsis line as shown below:</p>

<p>cat [-benstuv] [-] file ...</p>

<p>The following macros were used:</p>

<p>.Nm cat .Op Fl benstuv .Op Fl .Ar</p>

<p>.Sh DESCRIPTION In most cases the first text in the
DESCRIPTION sec- tion is a brief paragraph on the command,
function or file, followed by a lexical list of options and
respective explanations. To create such a list, the .Bl
(begin list), .It (list item) and .El (end list) macros are
used (see Lists and Columns below).</p>

<p>.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES Implementation specific
information should be placed here.</p>

<p>.Sh RETURN VALUES Sections 2, 3 and 9 function return
values should go here. The .Rv macro may be used to generate
text for use in the RETURN VALUES section for most section 2
and 3 library functions; see Return Values.</p>

<p>The following .Sh section headers are part of the
preferred manual page layout and must be used appropriately
to maintain consistency. They are listed in the order in
which they would be used.</p>

<p>.Sh ENVIRONMENT The ENVIRONMENT section should reveal
any related environment variables and clues to their
behavior and/or usage.</p>

<p>.Sh FILES Files which are used or created by the man
page sub- ject should be listed via the .Pa macro in the
FILES section.</p>

<p>.Sh EXAMPLES There are several ways to create examples.
See the EXAMPLES section below for details.</p>

<p>.Sh DIAGNOSTICS Diagnostic messages from a command
should be placed in this section. The .Ex macro may be used
to generate text for use in the DIAGNOSTICS section for most
sec- tion 1, 6 and 8 commands; see Exit Status.</p>

<p>.Sh COMPATIBILITY Known compatibility issues (e.g.
deprecated options or parameters) should be listed here.</p>

<p>.Sh ERRORS Specific error handling, especially from
library func- tions (man page sections 2, 3, and 9) should
go here. The .Er macro is used to specify an error
(errno).</p>

<p>.Sh SEE ALSO References to other material on the man
page topic and cross references to other relevant man pages
should be placed in the SEE ALSO section. Cross references
are specified using the .Xr macro. Currently refer(1) style
references are not accommodated.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the cross references are sorted
on the section number, then alphabetically on the names
within a section, and placed in that order and comma
separated. Example:</p>

<p>ls(1), ps(1), group(5), passwd(5)</p>

<p>.Sh STANDARDS If the command, library function or file
adheres to a specific implementation such as IEEE Std 1003.2
( POSIX.2 ) or ANSI X3.159-1989 (ANSI C) this should be
noted here. If the command does not adhere to any standard,
its history should be noted in the HISTORY section.</p>

<p>.Sh HISTORY Any command which does not adhere to any
specific standards should be outlined historically in this
sec- tion.</p>

<p>.Sh AUTHORS Credits should be placed here. The .An macro
should be used to specify the name(s) of the person(s).</p>

<p>.Sh BUGS Blatant problems with the topic go here.</p>

<p>User-specified .Sh sections may be added; for example,
this section was set with:</p>

<p>.Sh &quot;PAGE STRUCTURE DOMAIN&quot;</p>

<p>Subsection Headers Subsection headers have exactly the
same syntax as section headers: .Ss is parsed but not
generally callable. It can be used as an argument in a call
to .Ss only; it then reactivates the default font for
.Ss.</p>

<p>The default width is 8n.</p>

<p>Paragraphs and Line Spacing .Pp The .Pp paragraph
command may be used to specify a line space where necessary.
The macro is not necessary after a .Sh or .Ss macro or
before a .Bl or .Bd macro (which both assert a vertical
distance unless the -compact flag is given).</p>

<p>The macro is neither callable nor parsed and takes no
arguments; an alternative name is .Lp.</p>

<p>Keeps The only keep that is implemented at this time is
for words. The macros are .Bk (begin keep) and .Ek (end
keep). The only option that .Bk accepts currently is -words
(this is also the default if no option is given) which is
useful for preventing line breaks in the middle of options.
In the example for the make command line arguments (see
Whats in a Name), the keep prevented nroff from placing up
the flag and the argument on separate lines.</p>

<p>Both macros are neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>More work needs to be done with the keep macros;
specifically, a -line option should be added.</p>

<p>Examples and Displays There are seven types of
displays.</p>

<p>.D1 (This is D-one.) Display one line of indented text.
This macro is parsed but not callable.</p>

<p>-ldghfstru</p>

<p>The above was produced by: .D1 Fl ldghfstru.</p>

<p>.Dl (This is D-ell.) Display one line of indented
literal text. The .Dl example macro has been used throughout
this file. It allows the indentation (display) of one line
of text. Its default font is set to constant width
(literal). .Dl is parsed but not callable.</p>

<p>% ls -ldg /usr/local/bin</p>

<p>The above was produced by: .Dl % ls -ldg
/usr/local/bin.</p>

<p>.Bd Begin display. The .Bd display must be ended with
the .Ed macro. It has the following syntax:</p>

<p>.Bd {-literal | -filled | -unfilled | -ragged |
-centered} [-offset string ] [-file file name ]
[-compact]</p>

<p>-ragged Fill, but do not adjust the right margin (only
left-justify). -centered Center lines between the current
left and right margin. Note that each single line is
centered. -unfilled Do not fill; display a block of text as
typed, using line breaks as specified by the user. This can
produce overlong lines without warning mes- sages. -filled
Display a filled block. The block of text is formatted
(i.e., the text is justified on both the left and right
side). -literal Display block with literal font (usually
fixed- width). Useful for source code or simple tabbed or
spaced text. -file file name The file whose name follows the
-file flag is read and displayed before any data enclosed
with .Bd and .Ed , using the selected display type. Any
troff/-mdoc commands in the file will be pro- cessed.
-offset string If -offset is specified with one of the
following strings, the string is interpreted to indicate the
level of indentation for the forthcoming block of text:</p>

<p>left Align block on the current left mar- gin; this is
the default mode of .Bd. center Supposedly center the block.
At this time unfortunately, the block merely gets left
aligned about an imaginary center margin. indent Indent by
one default indent value or tab. The default indent value is
also used for the .D1 and .Dl macros, so one is guaranteed
the two types of displays will line up. The indentation
value is normally set to 6n or about two thirds of an inch
(six constant width characters). indent-two Indent two times
the default indent value. right This left aligns the block
about two inches from the right side of the page. This macro
needs work and per- haps may never do the right thing within
troff.</p>

<p>If string is a valid numeric expression instead (with a
scale indicator other than u ), use that value for
indentation. The most useful scale indicators are m and n,
specifying the so- called Em and En square. This is
approximately the width of the letters m and n respectively
of the current font (for nroff output, both scale indicators
give the same values). If string isnt a numeric expression,
it is tested whether it is an -mdoc macro name, and the
default offset value associated with this macro is used.
Finally, if all tests fail, the width of string (typeset
with a fixed-width font) is taken as the offset. -compact
Suppress insertion of vertical space before begin of
display.</p>

<p>.Ed End display (takes no arguments).</p>

<p>Lists and Columns There are several types of lists which
may be initiated with the .Bl begin-list macro. Items within
the list are specified with the .It item macro, and each
list must end with the .El macro. Lists may be nested within
themselves and within displays. The use of columns inside of
lists or lists inside of columns is unproven.</p>

<p>In addition, several list attributes may be specified
such as the width of a tag, the list offset, and compactness
(blank lines between items allowed or disallowed). Most of
this document has been formatted with a tag style list
(-tag).</p>

<p>It has the following syntax forms:</p>

<p>.Bl {-hang | -ohang | -tag | -diag | -inset} [-width
string] [-offset string] [-compact] .Bl -column [-offset
string] string1 string2 ... .Bl {-item | -enum [-nested] |
-bullet | -hyphen | -dash} [-offset string] [-compact]</p>

<p>And now a detailed description of the list types.</p>

<p>-bullet A bullet list.</p>

<p>.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact .It Bullet one goes
here. .It Bullet two here. .El</p>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p>&middot; Bullet one goes here. &middot; Bullet two
here.</p>

<p>-dash (or -hyphen) A dash list.</p>

<p>.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact .It Dash one goes
here. .It Dash two here. .El</p>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p>- Dash one goes here. - Dash two here.</p>

<p>-enum An enumerated list.</p>

<p>.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact .It Item one goes
here. .It And item two here. .El</p>

<p>The result:</p>

<p>1. Item one goes here. 2. And item two here.</p>

<p>If you want to nest enumerated lists, use the -nested
flag (starting with the second-level list):</p>

<p>.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact .It Item one goes here
.Bl -enum -nested -compact .It Item two goes here. .It And
item three here. .El .It And item four here. .El</p>

<p>Result:</p>

<p>1. Item one goes here. 1.1. Item two goes here. 1.2. And
item three here. 2. And item four here.</p>

<p>-item A list of type -item without list markers.</p>

<p>.Bl -item -offset indent .It Item one goes here. Item
one goes here. Item one goes here. .It Item two here. Item
two here. Item two here. .El</p>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p>Item one goes here. Item one goes here. Item one goes
here.</p>

<p>Item two here. Item two here. Item two here.</p>

<p>-tag A list with tags. Use -width to specify the tag
width.</p>

<p>SL sleep time of the process (seconds blocked) PAGEIN
number of disk I/O s resulting from references by the
process to pages not loaded in core. UID numerical user-id
of process owner PPID numerical id of parent of process
priority (non-pos- itive when in non-interruptible wait)</p>

<p>The raw text:</p>

<p>.Bl -tag -width &quot;PPID&quot; -compact -offset indent
.It SL sleep time of the process (seconds blocked) .It
PAGEIN number of disk .Tn I/O Ns s resulting from references
by the process to pages not loaded in core. .It UID
numerical user-id of process owner .It PPID numerical id of
parent of process priority (non-positive when in
non-interruptible wait) .El</p>

<p>-diag Diag lists create section four diagnostic lists
and are similar to inset lists except callable macros are
ignored. The -width flag is not meaningful in this
context.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>.Bl -diag .It You cant use Sy here. The message says
all. .El</p>

<p>produces</p>

<p>You cat use Sy here. The message says all.</p>

<p>-hang A list with hanging tags.</p>

<p>Hanged labels appear similar to tagged lists when the
label is smaller than the label width.</p>

<p>Longer hanged list labels blend into the paragraph
unlike tagged paragraph labels.</p>

<p>And the unformatted text which created it:</p>

<p>.Bl -hang -offset indent .It Em Hanged labels appear
similar to tagged lists when the label is smaller than the
label width. .It Em Longer hanged list labels blend into the
paragraph unlike tagged paragraph labels. .El</p>

<p>-ohang Lists with overhanging tags do not use
indentation for the items; tags are written to a separate
line.</p>

<p>SL sleep time of the process (seconds blocked)</p>

<p>PAGEIN number of disk I/Os resulting from references by
the pro- cess to pages not loaded in core.</p>

<p>UID numerical user-id of process owner</p>

<p>PPID numerical id of parent of process priority
(non-positive when in non-interruptible wait)</p>

<p>The raw text:</p>

<p>.Bl -ohang -offset indent .It Sy SL sleep time of the
process (seconds blocked) .It Sy PAGEIN number of disk .Tn
I/O Ns s resulting from references by the process to pages
not loaded in core. .It Sy UID numerical user-id of process
owner .It Sy PPID numerical id of parent of process priority
(non-positive when in non-interruptible wait) .El</p>

<p>-inset Here is an example of inset labels:</p>

<p>Tag The tagged list (also called a tagged paragraph) is
the most common type of list used in the Berkeley manuals.
Use a -width attribute as described below.</p>

<p>Diag Diag lists create section four diagnostic lists and
are similar to inset lists except callable macros are
ignored.</p>

<p>Hang Hanged labels are a matter of taste.</p>

<p>Ohang Overhanging labels are nice when space is con-
strained.</p>

<p>Inset Inset labels are useful for controlling blocks of
paragraphs and are valuable for converting -mdoc manuals to
other formats.</p>

<p>Here is the source text which produced the above
example:</p>

<p>.Bl -inset -offset indent .It Em Tag The tagged list
(also called a tagged paragraph) is the most common type of
list used in the Berkeley manuals. .It Em Diag Diag lists
create section four diagnostic lists and are similar to
inset lists except callable macros are ignored. .It Em Hang
Hanged labels are a matter of taste. .It Em Ohang
Overhanging labels are nice when space is constrained. .It
Em Inset Inset labels are useful for controlling blocks of
paragraphs and are valuable for converting .Nm -mdoc manuals
to other formats. .El</p>

<p>-column This list type generates multiple columns. The
number of columns and the width of each column is determined
by the argu- ments to the -column list, string1, string2 ,
etc. If stringN starts with a . (dot) immediately followed
by a valid -mdoc macro name, interpret stringN and use the
width of the result. Otherwise, the width of stringN
(typeset with a fixed-width font) is taken as the Nth column
width.</p>

<p>Each .It argument is parsed to make a row, each column
within the row is a separate argument separated by a tab or
the .Ta macro.</p>

<p>The table:</p>

<p>String Nroff Troff &lt;= &lt;= &gt;= &gt;=</p>

<p>was produced by:</p>

<p>.Bl -column -offset indent &quot;.Sy String&quot;
&quot;.Sy Nroff&quot; &quot;.Sy Troff&quot; .It Sy String Ta
Sy Nroff Ta Sy Troff .It Li &lt;= Ta &lt;= Ta .It Li &gt;=
Ta &gt;= Ta .El</p>

<p>Other keywords:</p>

<p>-width string If string starts with a . (dot)
immediately fol- lowed by a valid -mdoc macro name,
interpret string and use the width of the result. Almost all
lists in this document use this option.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>.Bl -tag -width &quot;.Fl test Ao Ar string Ac&quot; .It
Fl test Ao Ar string Ac This is a longer sentence to show
how the .Fl width flag works in combination with a tag list.
.El</p>

<p>gives:</p>

<p>-test string This is a longer sentence to show how the
-width flag works in combination with a tag list.</p>

<p>(Note that the current state of -mdoc is saved before
string is interpreted; afterwards, all variables are
restored again. However, boxes (used for enclosures) can t
be saved in GNU troff(1); as a consequence, argu- ments must
always be balanced to avoid nasty errors. For example, do
not write .Ao Ar string but .Ao Ar string Xc instead if you
really need only an opening angle bracket.)</p>

<p>Otherwise, if string is a valid numeric expression (with
a scale indicator other than u), use that value for
indentation. The most useful scale indicators are m and n,
specifying the so-called Em and En square. This is
approximately the width of the letters m and n respectively
of the current font (for nroff output, both scale indicators
give the same values). If string isnt a numeric expression,
it is tested whether it is an -mdoc macro name, and the
default width value associated with this macro is used.
Finally, if all tests fail, the width of string (typeset
with a fixed-width font) is taken as the width.</p>

<p>If a width is not specified for the tag list type, every
time .It is invoked, an attempt is made to determine an
appropriate width. If the first argument to .It is a
callable macro, the default width for that macro will be
used; otherwise, the default width of .No is used.</p>

<p>-offset string If string is indent, a default indent
value (normally set to 6n, similar to the value used in .Dl
or .Bd) is used. If string is a valid numeric expression
instead (with a scale indicator other than u), use that
value for indentation. The most useful scale indicators are
m and n, specifying the so-called Em and En square. This is
approximately the width of the letters m and n respectively
of the current font (for nroff output, both scale indicators
give the same values). If string isn t a numeric expression,
it is tested whether it is an -mdoc macro name, and the
default offset value associated with this macro is used.
Finally, if all tests fail, the width of string (typeset
with a fixed-width font) is taken as the offset.</p>

<p>-compact Suppress insertion of vertical space before the
list and between list items.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS MACROS Here a list of the remaining macros
which do not fit well into one of the above sections. We
couldn t find real examples for the following macros: .Me
and .Ot. They are documented here for completeness - if you
know how to use them properly please send a mail to
bug-groff@gnu.org (includ- ing an example).</p>

<p>.Bt prints</p>

<p>is currently in beta test.</p>

<p>It is neither callable nor parsed and takes no
arguments.</p>

<p>.Fr</p>

<p>Usage: .Fr function return value ...</p>

<p>Dont use this macro. It allows a break right before the
return value (usually a single digit) which is bad
typographical behaviour. Use to tie the return value to the
previous word.</p>

<p>.Hf Use this macro to include a (header) file literally.
It first prints File: followed by the file name, then the
contents of file.</p>

<p>Usage: .Hf file</p>

<p>It is neither callable nor parsed.</p>

<p>.Lk To be written.</p>

<p>.Me Exact usage unknown. The documentation in the -mdoc
source file describes it as a macro for menu entries.</p>

<p>Its default width is 6n.</p>

<p>.Mt To be written.</p>

<p>.Ot Exact usage unknown. The documentation in the -mdoc
source file describes it as old function type (fortran).</p>

<p>.Sm Activate (toggle) space mode.</p>

<p>Usage: .Sm [on | off] ...</p>

<p>If space mode is off, no spaces between macro arguments
are inserted. If called without a parameter (or if the next
parameter is neither on nor off, .Sm toggles space mode.</p>

<p>.Ud prints</p>

<p>currently under development.</p>

<p>It is neither callable nor parsed and takes no
arguments.</p>

<p>PREDEFINED STRINGS The following strings are
predefined:</p>

<p>String Nroff Troff Meaning &lt;= &lt;= less equal &gt;=
&gt;= greater equal Rq right double quote Lq left double
quote ua ^ upwards arrow aa &acute; &acute; acute accent ga
&lsquo; &lsquo; grave accent q &quot; &quot; straight double
quote Pi pi greek pi Ne != not equal Le &lt;= less equal Ge
&gt;= greater equal Lt &lt; &lt; less than Gt &gt; &gt;
greater than Pm +- &plusmn; plus minus If infinity infinity
Am &amp; &amp; ampersand Na NaN NaN not a number Ba | |
vertical bar</p>

<p>The names of the columns Nroff and Troff are a bit
misleading; Nroff shows the ASCII representation, while
Troff gives the best glyph form available. For example, a
Unicode enabled TTY-device will have proper glyph
representations for all strings, whereas the enhancement for
a Latin1 TTY-device is only the plus-minus sign.</p>

<p>String names which consist of two characters can be
written as ; string names which consist of one character can
be written as . A generic syntax for a string name of any
length is (this is a GNU troff(1) extension).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The debugging macro .Db available in
previous versions of -mdoc has been removed since GNU
troff(1) provides better facilities to check parameters;
additionally, many error and warning messages have been
added to this macro package, making it both more robust and
verbose.</p>

<p>The only remaining debugging macro is .Rd which yields a
register dump of all global registers and strings. A normal
user will never need it.</p>

<p>FORMATTING WITH GROFF, TROFF, AND NROFF By default, the
package inhibits page breaks, headers, and footers if
displayed with a TTY device like latin1 or unicode to make
the manual more efficient for viewing on-line. This
behaviour can be changed (e.g. to create a hardcopy of the
TTY output) by setting the register cR to zero while calling
groff:</p>

<p>groff -Tlatin1 -rcR=0 -mdoc foo.man &gt; foo.txt</p>

<p>For double-sided printing, set register D to 1:</p>

<p>groff -Tps -rD1 -mdoc foo.man &gt; foo.ps</p>

<p>To change the document font size to 11pt or 12pt, set
register S accordingly:</p>

<p>groff -Tdvi -rS11 -mdoc foo.man &gt; foo.dvi</p>

<p>Register S is ignored for TTY devices.</p>

<p>The line and title length can be changed by setting the
registers LL and LT, respectively:</p>

<p>groff -Tutf8 -rLL=100n -rLT=100n -mdoc foo.man |
less</p>

<p>If not set, both registers default to 78n for TTY
devices and 6.5i other- wise.</p>

<p>FILES doc.tmac The main manual macro package. mdoc.tmac
A wrapper file to call doc.tmac. mdoc/doc-common Common
strings, definitions, stuff related typographic output.
mdoc/doc-nroff Definitions used for a TTY output device.
mdoc/doc-ditroff Definitions used for all other devices.
mdoc.local Local additions and customizations. andoc.tmac
This file checks whether the -mdoc or the -man package
should be used.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO groff(1), man(1), troff(1), groff_man(7)</p>

<p>BUGS Section 3f has not been added to the header
routines.</p>

<p>.Nm font should be changed in NAME section.</p>

<p>.Fn needs to have a check to prevent splitting up if the
line length is too short. Occasionally it separates the last
parenthesis, and sometimes looks ridiculous if a line is in
fill mode.</p>

<p>The list and display macros do not do any keeps and
certainly should be able to.</p>
