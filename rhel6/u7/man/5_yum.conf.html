<p>yum.conf(5) yum configuration file yum.conf(5)</p>

<p>NAME yum.conf - Configuration file for yum(8).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Yum uses a configuration file at
/etc/yum.conf.</p>

<p>Additional configuration files are also read from the
directories set by the reposdir option (default is
/etc/yum.repos.d). See the repos- dir option below for
further details.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS There are two types of sections in the yum
configuration file(s): main and repository. Main defines all
global configuration options. There should be only one main
section. The repository section(s) define the configuration
for each repository/server. There should be one or more
repository sections.</p>

<p>[main] OPTIONS The [main] section must exist for yum to
do anything. It consists of the following options:</p>

<p>cachedir Directory where yum should store its cache and
db files. The default is /var/cache/yum.</p>

<p>persistdir Directory where yum should store information
that should persist over multiple runs. The default is
/var/lib/yum.</p>

<p>keepcache Either 1 or 0. Determines whether or not yum
keeps the cache of headers and packages after successful
installation. Default is 1 (keep files)</p>

<p>reposdir A list of directories where yum should look for
.repo files which define repositories to use. Default is
/etc/yum.repos.d. Each file in this directory should contain
one or more repository sections as documented in
[repository] options below. These will be merged with the
repositories defined in /etc/yum.conf to form the complete
set of reposito- ries that yum will use.</p>

<p>debuglevel Debug message output level. Practical range
is 0-10. Default is 2.</p>

<p>errorlevel Error message output level. Practical range
is 0-10. Default is 2.</p>

<p>rpmverbosity Debug scriptlet output level. info is the
default, other options are: critical, emergency, error, warn
and debug.</p>

<p>protected_packages This is a list of packages that yum
should never completely remove. They are protected via
Obsoletes as well as user/plugin removals.</p>

<p>The default is: yum glob:/etc/yum/protected.d/*.conf So
any packages which should be protected can do so by
including a file in /etc/yum/protected.d with their package
name in it.</p>

<p>Also if this configuration is set to anything, then yum
will protect the package corresponding to the running
version of the kernel.</p>

<p>protected_multilib Either 1 or 0. This tells yum whether
or not it should perform a check to make sure that multilib
pack- ages are the same version. For example, if this option
is off (rpm behavior) then in some cases it might be
possible for pkgA-1.x86_64 and pkgA-2.i386 to be installed
at the same time. However this is very rarely desired.
Install only packages, like the kernel, are exempt from this
check. The default is 1.</p>

<p>logfile Full directory and file name for where yum
should write its log file.</p>

<p>gpgcheck Either 1 or 0. This tells yum whether or not it
should perform a GPG signature check on packages. When this
is set in the [main] section it sets the default for all
reposito- ries. The default is 0.</p>

<p>localpkg_gpgcheck Either 1 or 0. This tells yum whether
or not it should perform a GPG signature check on local
packages (packages in a file, not in a repositoy). The
default is 0.</p>

<p>repo_gpgcheck Either 1 or 0. This tells yum whether or
not it should perform a GPG signature check on the repodata.
When this is set in the [main] section it sets the default
for all repositories. The default is 0.</p>

<p>skip_broken Either 1 or 0 . Resolve depsolve problems by
removing packages that are causing problems from the
transac- tion.</p>

<p>assumeyes Either 1 or 0. Determines whether or not yum
prompts for confirmation of critical actions. Default is 0
(do prompt). Command-line option: -y --assumeyes</p>

<p>assumeno Either 1 or 0. If yum would prompt for
confirmation of critical actions, assume the user chose no.
This is basically the same as doing &quot;echo | yum
...&quot; but is a bit more usable. This option overrides
assumeyes, but is still subject to alwaysprompt. Default is
0 (do prompt). Command-line option: --assumeno</p>

<p>alwaysprompt Either 1 or 0. Without this option, yum
will not prompt for confirmation when the list of packages
to be installed exactly matches those given on the command
line. Unless assumeyes is enabled, it will still prompt for
package removal, or when additional packages need to be
installed to fulfill dependencies. Default is 1.</p>

<p>tolerant Either 1 or 0. If enabled, then yum will be
toler- ant of errors on the command line with regard to
packages. For example: if you request to install foo, bar
and baz and baz is installed; yum wont error out complaining
that baz is already installed. Default to 0 (not tolerant).
Note: This option currently does nothing. Command-line
option: -t</p>

<p>exclude List of packages to exclude from updates or
installs. This should be a space separated list. Shell globs
using wild- cards (eg. * and ?) are allowed.</p>

<p>+.IP +query_install_excludes +This applies the command
line --exclude option (only, not the configuration +exclude
above) to installed packages being shown in some query
commands +(cur- rently: list/info/search/provides).</p>

<p>exactarch Either 1 or 0. Set to 1 to make yum update
only update the architectures of packages that you have
installed. ie: with this enabled yum will not install an
i686 package to update an i386 package. Default is 1.</p>

<p>installonlypkgs List of package provides that should
only ever be installed, never updated. Kernels in particular
fall into this category. Defaults to kernel, kernel-bigmem,
kernel-enter- prise, kernel-smp, kernel-debug,
kernel-unsupported, kernel- source, kernel-devel,
kernel-PAE, kernel-PAE-debug.</p>

<p>Note that because these are provides, and not just
package names, kernel-devel will also apply to
kernel-debug-devel, etc.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;kernel-modules&quot; is not in this
list, in RHEL-6, and so anything providing that is updated
like any other package.</p>

<p>installonly_limit Number of packages listed in
installonlypkgs to keep installed at the same time. Setting
to 0 disables this feature. Default is 3. Note that this
functionality used to be in the &quot;installonlyn&quot;
plugin, where this option was altered via tokeep. Note that
as of version 3.2.24, yum will now look in the yumdb for a
installonly attribute on installed packages. If that
attribute is &quot;keep&quot;, then they will never be
removed.</p>

<p>kernelpkgnames List of package names that are kernels.
This is really only here for the updating of kernel packages
and should be removed out in the yum 2.1 series.</p>

<p>showdupesfromrepos Either 0 or 1. Set to 1 if you wish
to show any duplicate packages from any repository, from
package listings like the info or list commands. Set to 0 if
you want only to see the newest packages from any
repository. Default is 0.</p>

<p>obsoletes This option only has affect during an update.
It enables yum s obsoletes processing logic. Useful when
doing dis- tribution level upgrades. See also the yum
upgrade command docu- mentation for more details (yum(8)).
Default is true. Command-line option: --obsoletes</p>

<p>overwrite_groups Either 0 or 1 . Used to determine yums
behaviour if two or more repositories offer the package
groups with the same name. If overwrite_groups is 1 then the
group packages of the last matching repository will be used.
If over- write_groups is 0 then the groups from all matching
reposito- ries will be merged together as one large
group.</p>

<p>groupremove_leaf_only Either 0 or 1 . Used to determine
yums behaviour when the groupremove command is run. If
groupre- move_leaf_only is 0 (default) then all packages in
the group will be removed. If groupremove_leaf_only is 1
then only those packages in the group that aren t required
by another package will be removed.</p>

<p>enable_group_conditionals Either 0 or 1. Determines
whether yum will allow the use of conditionals packages.
Default is 1 (package conditionals are allowed).</p>

<p>group_package_types List of the following: optional,
default, mandatory. Tells yum which type of packages in
groups will be installed when groupinstall is called.
Default is: default, mandatory</p>

<p>installroot Specifies an alternative installroot,
relative to which all packages will be installed.
Command-line option: --installroot</p>

<p>distroverpkg The package used by yum to determine the
&quot;version&quot; of the distribution. This can be any
installed package. Default is redhat-release. You can see
what provides this manually by using: &quot;yum whatprovides
redhat-release&quot;.</p>

<p>diskspacecheck Either 0 or 1. Set this to 0 to disable
the checking for sufficient diskspace before a RPM
transaction is run. Default is 1 (perform the check).</p>

<p>tsflags Comma or space separated list of transaction
flags to pass to the rpm transaction set. These include
noscripts, notriggers , nodocs , test , justdb and
nocontexts. repackage is also available but that does
nothing with newer rpm versions. You can set all/any of
them. However, if you dont know what these do in the context
of an rpm transaction set you re best leaving it alone.
Default is an empty list.</p>

<p>recent Number of days back to look for recent packages
added to a repository. Used by the list recent command.
Default is 7.</p>

<p>retries Set the number of times any attempt to retrieve
a file should retry before returning an error. Setting this
to 0 makes yum try forever. Default is 10.</p>

<p>keepalive Either 0 or 1 . Set whether HTTP keepalive
should be used for HTTP/1.1 servers that support it. This
can improve transfer speeds by using one connection when
downloading multiple files from a repository. Default is
1.</p>

<p>timeout Number of seconds to wait for a connection
before timing out. Defaults to 30 seconds. This may be too
short of a time for extremely overloaded sites.</p>

<p>http_caching Determines how upstream HTTP caches are
instructed to handle any HTTP downloads that Yum does. This
option can take the following values:</p>

<p>all means that all HTTP downloads should be cached.</p>

<p>packages means that only RPM package downloads should be
cached (but not repository metadata downloads).</p>

<p>none means that no HTTP downloads should be cached.</p>

<p>The default is all. This is recommended unless you are
experi- encing caching related issues. Try to at least use
packages to minimize load on repository servers.</p>

<p>throttle Enable bandwidth throttling for downloads. This
option can be expressed as a absolute data rate in
bytes/sec. An SI prefix (k, M or G) may be appended to the
bandwidth value (eg. 5.5k is 5.5 kilobytes/sec, 2M is 2
Megabytes/sec).</p>

<p>Alternatively, this option can specify the percentage of
total bandwidth to use (eg. 60% ). In this case the
bandwidth option should be used to specify the maximum
available bandwidth.</p>

<p>Set to 0 to disable bandwidth throttling. This is the
default.</p>

<p>bandwidth Use to specify the maximum available network
bandwidth in bytes/second. Used with the throttle option
(above). If throttle is a percentage and bandwidth is 0 then
bandwidth throttling will be disabled. If throttle is
expressed as a data rate (bytes/sec) then this option is
ignored. Default is 0 (no bandwidth throttling).</p>

<p>sslcacert Path to the directory containing the databases
of the certificate authorities yum should use to verify SSL
certifi- cates. Defaults to none - uses system default</p>

<p>sslverify Boolean - should yum verify SSL
certificates/hosts at all. Defaults to True.</p>

<p>Note that the plugin yum-rhn-plugin will force this
value to true, and may alter other ssl settings (like
hostname checking), even if it the machine is not
registered.</p>

<p>sslclientcert Path to the SSL client certificate yum
should use to connect to repos/remote sites Defaults to
none.</p>

<p>Note that if you are using curl compiled against NSS
(default in Fedora/RHEL), curl treats sslclientcert values
with the same basename as _identical_. This version of yum
will check that this isn t true and output an error when the
repositories &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; violate
this, like so:</p>

<p>sslclientcert basename shared between foo and bar</p>

<p>sslclientkey Path to the SSL client key yum should use
to con- nect to repos/remote sites Defaults to none.</p>

<p>ssl_check_cert_permissions Boolean - Whether yum should
check the permissions on the paths for the certificates on
the reposi- tory (both remote and local). If we cant read
any of the files then yum will force skip_if_unavailable to
be true. This is most useful for non-root processes which
use yum on repos. that have client cert files which are
readable only by root. Defaults to True.</p>

<p>history_record Boolean - should yum record history
entries for transactions. This takes some disk space, and
some extra time in the transactions. But it allows how to
know a lot of information about what has happened before,
and display it to the user with the history
info/list/summary commands. yum also provides the history
undo/redo commands. Defaults to True.</p>

<p>Note that if history is recorded, yum uses that
information to see if any modifications to the rpmdb have
been done outside of yum. These are always bad, from yums
point of view, and so yum will issue a warning and
automatically run some of &quot;yum check&quot; to try and
find some of the worst problems altering the rpmdb might
have caused.</p>

<p>This means that turning this option off will stop yum
from being able to detect when the rpmdb has changed and
thus. it will never warn you or automatically run &quot;yum
check&quot;. The problems will likely still be there, and
yumdb etc. will still be wrong but yum will not warn you
about it.</p>

<p>history_record_packages This is a list of package names
that should be recorded as having helped the transaction.
yum plugins have an API to add themselves to this, so it
should not normally be necessary to add packages here. Not
that this is also used for the packages to look for in
--version. Defaults to rpm, yum, yum-metadata-parser.</p>

<p>history_list_view Which column of information to display
in the &quot;yum history list&quot; command. There are
currently three options: users, cmds (or commands),
single-user-commands.</p>

<p>Older versions of yum acted like &quot;users&quot;,
which always outputs the user who initiated the yum
transaction. You can now specify &quot;commands&quot; which
will instead always output the command line of the
transaction. You can also specify
&quot;single-user-commands&quot; which will display the
users if there are more than one, other- wise it will
display the command line.</p>

<p>You can also specify &quot;default&quot; which currently
selects &quot;users&quot;.</p>

<p>commands List of functional commands to run if no
functional commands are specified on the command line (eg.
&quot;update foo bar baz quux&quot;). None of the short
options (eg. -y, -e, -d) are accepted for this option.</p>

<p>syslog_ident Identification (program name) for syslog
messages.</p>

<p>syslog_facility Facility name for syslog messages, see
sys- log(3). Default is LOG_USER.</p>

<p>syslog_device Where to log syslog messages. Can be a
local device (path) or a host:port string to use a remote
syslog. If empty or points to a nonexistent device, syslog
logging is dis- abled. Default is /dev/log.</p>

<p>proxy URL to the proxy server that yum should use.</p>

<p>proxy_username username to use for proxy</p>

<p>proxy_password password for this proxy</p>

<p>username username to use for basic authentication to a
repo or really any url.</p>

<p>password password to use with the username for basic
authentica- tion.</p>

<p>plugins Either 0 or 1. Global switch to enable or
disable yum plugins. Default is 0 (plugins disabled). See
the PLUGINS section of the yum(8) man for more information
on installing yum plugins.</p>

<p>pluginpath A list of directories where yum should look
for plu- gin modules. Default is /usr/share/yum-plugins and
/usr/lib/yum-plugins.</p>

<p>pluginconfpath A list of directories where yum should
look for plugin configuration files. Default is
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d.</p>

<p>metadata_expire Time (in seconds) after which the
metadata will expire. So that if the current metadata
downloaded is less than this many seconds old then yum will
not update the metadata against the repository. If you find
that yum is not downloading information on updates as often
as you would like lower the value of this option. You can
also change from the default of using seconds to using days,
hours or minutes by appending a d, h or m respectively. The
default is 6 hours, to compliment yum- updatesd running once
an hour. It s also possible to use the word
&quot;never&quot;, meaning that the metadata will never
expire. Note that when using a metalink file the metalink
must always be newer than the metadata for the repository,
due to the valida- tion, so this timeout also applies to the
metalink file.</p>

<p>mirrorlist_expire Time (in seconds) after which the
mirrorlist locally cached will expire. If the current
mirrorlist is less than this many seconds old then yum will
not download another copy of the mirrorlist, it has the same
extra format as meta- data_expire. If you find that yum is
not downloading the mir- rorlists as often as you would like
lower the value of this option.</p>

<p>mdpolicy You can select from different metadata download
poli- cies depending on how much data you want to download
with the main repository metadata index. The advantages of
downloading more metadata with the index is that you can t
get into situa- tions where you need to use that metadata
later and the versions available aren t compatible (or the
user lacks privileges) and that if the metadata is corrupt
in any way yum will revert to the previous metadata.</p>

<p>instant - Just download the new metadata index, this is
roughly what yum always did, however it now does some
checking on the index and reverts if it classifies it as
bad.</p>

<p>group:primary - Download the primary metadata with the
index. This contains most of the package information and so
is almost always required anyway. This is the default.</p>

<p>group:small - With the primary also download the
updateinfo metadata, this is required for yum-security
operations and it also used in the graphical clients. This
file also tends to be significantly smaller than most
others.</p>

<p>group:main - With the primary and updateinfo download
the filelists metadata and the group metadata. The filelists
data is required for operations like &quot;yum install
/bin/bash&quot;, and also some dependency resolutions
require it. The group data is used in some graphical clients
and for group operations like &quot;yum grouplist
Base&quot;.</p>

<p>group:all - Download all metadata listed in the index,
cur- rently the only one not listed above is the other
metadata, which contains the changelog information which is
used by yum- changelog. This is what &quot;yum
makecache&quot; uses.</p>

<p>multilib_policy Can be set to all or best . All means
install all possible arches for any package you want to
install. There- fore yum install foo will install foo.i386
and foo.x86_64 on x86_64, if it is available. Best means
install the best arch for this platform, only.</p>

<p>bugtracker_url URL where bugs should be filed for yum.
Config- urable for local versions or distro-specific
bugtrackers.</p>

<p>color Display colorized output automatically, depending
on the output terminal, always (using ANSI codes) or never.
Command- line option: --color</p>

<p>color_list_installed_older The colorization/highlighting
for packages in list/info installed which are older than the
latest available package with the same name and arch.
Default is bold . Possible values are a comma separated list
containing: bold, blink, dim, reverse, underline, fg:black,
fg:red, fg:green, fg:yellow, fg:blue, fg:magenta, fg:cyan,
fg:white, bg:black, bg:red, bg:green, bg:yellow, bg:blue,
bg:magenta, bg:cyan, bg:white.</p>

<p>color_list_installed_newer The colorization/highlighting
for packages in list/info installed which are newer than the
latest available package with the same name and arch.
Default is bold,yellow. See color_list_installed_older for
possible val- ues.</p>

<p>color_list_installed_reinstall The
colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
installed which is the same version as the latest available
package with the same name and arch. Default is normal . See
color_list_installed_older for possible val- ues.</p>

<p>color_list_installed_extra The colorization/highlighting
for packages in list/info installed which has no available
package with the same name and arch. Default is bold,red.
See color_list_installed_older for possible values.</p>

<p>color_list_available_upgrade The
colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which is an upgrade for the lat- est installed
package with the same name and arch. Default is bold,blue .
See color_list_installed_older for possible val- ues.</p>

<p>color_list_available_downgrade The
colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which is a downgrade for the latest installed
package with the same name and arch. Default is dim,cyan .
See color_list_installed_older for possible val- ues.</p>

<p>color_list_available_install The
colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which has no installed package with the same name
and arch. Default is normal. See color_list_installed_older
for possible values.</p>

<p>color_list_available_reinstall The
colorization/highlighting for packages in list/info
available which is the same version as the installed package
with the same name and arch. Default is
bold,underline,green. See color_list_installed_older for
pos- sible values.</p>

<p>color_search_match The colorization/highlighting for
text matches in search. Default is bold. See
color_list_installed_older for possible values.</p>

<p>color_update_installed The colorization/highlighting for
pack- ages in the &quot;updates list&quot; which are
installed. The updates list is what is printed when you run
&quot;yum update&quot;, &quot;yum list updates&quot;,
&quot;yum list obsoletes&quot; and &quot;yum
check-update&quot;. Default is normal . See
color_list_installed_older for possible val- ues.</p>

<p>color_update_local The colorization/highlighting for
packages in the &quot;updates list&quot; which are already
downloaded. The updates list is what is printed when you run
&quot;yum update&quot;, &quot;yum list updates&quot;,
&quot;yum list obsoletes&quot; and &quot;yum
check-update&quot;. Default is bold . See
color_list_installed_older for possible values.</p>

<p>color_update_remote The colorization/highlighting for
packages in the &quot;updates list&quot; which need to be
downloaded. The updates list is what is printed when you run
&quot;yum update&quot;, &quot;yum list updates&quot;,
&quot;yum list obsoletes&quot; and &quot;yum
check-update&quot;. Default is normal . See
color_list_installed_older for possible val- ues.</p>

<p>clean_requirements_on_remove When removing packages (by
removal, update or obsoletion) go through each packages
dependencies. If any of them are no longer required by any
other package then also mark them to be removed. Boolean (1,
0, True, False, yes,no) Defaults to False</p>

<p>reset_nice If set to true then yum will try to reset the
nice value to zero, before running an rpm transaction.
Defaults to True.</p>

<p>depsolve_loop_limit Set the number of times any attempt
to dep- solve before we just give up. This shouldnt be
needed as yum should always solve or fail, however it has
been observed that it can loop forever with very large
system upgrades. Setting this to 0 (or
&quot;&lt;forever&gt;&quot;) makes yum try forever. Default
is 100.</p>

<p>[repository] OPTIONS The repository section(s) take the
following form:</p>

<p>Example: [repositoryid] name=Some name for this
repository baseurl=url://path/to/repository/</p>

<p>repositoryid Must be a unique name for each repository,
one word.</p>

<p>name A human readable string describing the
repository.</p>

<p>baseurl Must be a URL to the directory where the yum
reposi- torys repodata directory lives. Can be an http://,
ftp:// or file:// URL. You can specify multiple URLs in one
baseurl state- ment. The best way to do this is like this:
[repositoryid] name=Some name for this repository
baseurl=url://server1/path/to/repository/
url://server2/path/to/repository/
url://server3/path/to/repository/</p>

<p>If you list more than one baseurl= statement in a
repository you will find yum will ignore the earlier ones
and probably act bizarrely. Dont do this, youve been
warned.</p>

<p>You can use HTTP basic auth by prepending
&quot;user:password@&quot; to the server name in the baseurl
line. For example:
&quot;baseurl=http://user:passwd@example.com/&quot;.</p>

<p>metalink Specifies a URL to a metalink file for the
repomd.xml, a list of mirrors for the entire repository are
generated by converting the mirrors for the repomd.xml file
to a baseurl. The metalink file also contains the latest
timestamp from the data in the repomd.xml, the length of the
repomd.xml and checksum data. This data is checked against
any downloaded repomd.xml file and all of the information
from the metalink file must match. This can be used instead
of or with the baseurl option. Substitution variables,
described below, can be used with this option. This option
disables the mirrorlist option. As a spe- cial hack is the
mirrorlist URL contains the word &quot;metalink&quot; then
the value of mirrorlist is copied to metalink (if metalink
is not set).</p>

<p>mirrorlist Specifies a URL to a file containing a list
of baseurls. This can be used instead of or with the baseurl
option. Substitution variables, described below, can be used
with this option. As a special hack is the mirrorlist URL
con- tains the word &quot;metalink&quot; then the value of
mirrorlist is copied to metalink (if metalink is not
set).</p>

<p>enabled Either 1 or 0. This tells yum whether or not use
this repository.</p>

<p>gpgcheck Either 1 or 0. This tells yum whether or not it
should perform a GPG signature check on the packages gotten
from this repository.</p>

<p>repo_gpgcheck Either 1 or 0 . This tells yum whether or
not it should perform a GPG signature check on the repodata
from this repository.</p>

<p>gpgkey A URL pointing to the ASCII-armored GPG key file
for the repository. This option is used if yum needs a
public key to verify a package and the required key hasn t
been imported into the RPM database. If this option is set,
yum will automatically import the key from the specified
URL. You will be prompted before the key is installed unless
the assumeyes option is set.</p>

<p>Multiple URLs may be specified here in the same manner
as the baseurl option (above). If a GPG key is required to
install a package from a repository, all keys specified for
that reposi- tory will be installed.</p>

<p>gpgcakey A URL pointing to the ASCII-armored CA key file
for the repository. This is a normal gpg public key - but
this key will be used to validate detached signatures of all
other keys. The idea is you are asked to confirm import for
this key. After that any other gpg key needed for package or
repository verification, if it has a detached signature
which matches this key will be automatically imported
without user confirmation.</p>

<p>exclude Same as the [main] exclude option but only for
this repository. Substitution variables, described below,
are hon- ored here.</p>

<p>includepkgs Inverse of exclude. This is a list of
packages you want to use from a repository. If this option
lists only one package then that is all yum will ever see
from the repository. Defaults to an empty list. Substitution
variables, described below, are honored here.</p>

<p>enablegroups Either 0 or 1. Determines whether yum will
allow the use of package groups for this repository. Default
is 1 (package groups are allowed).</p>

<p>failovermethod Either roundrobin or priority.</p>

<p>roundrobin randomly selects a URL out of the list of
URLs to start with and proceeds through each of them as it
encounters a failure contacting the host.</p>

<p>priority starts from the first baseurl listed and reads
through them sequentially.</p>

<p>skip_if_unavailable If set to True yum will continue

<p>URL INCLUDE SYNTAX The inclusion of external
configuration files is supported for /etc/yum.conf and the
.repo files in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory. To include a
URL, use a line of the following format:</p>

<p>include=url://to/some/location</p>

<p>The configuration file will be inserted at the position
of the &quot;include=&quot; line. Included files may contain
further include lines. Yum will abort with an error if an
inclusion loop is detected.</p>

<p>GLOB: FOR LIST OPTIONS Any of the configurations options
which are a list of items can be specfied using the glob
syntax: glob:/etc/path/somewhere.d/*.conf. This will read in
all files matching that glob and include all lines in each
file (excluding comments and blank lines) as items in the
list.</p>

<p>VARIABLES There are a number of variables you can use to
ease maintenance of yums configuration files. They are
available in the values of several options including name,
baseurl and commands.</p>

<p>$releasever This will be replaced with the value of the
version of the package listed in distroverpkg. This defaults
to the ver- sion of redhat-release package.</p>

<p>$arch This will be replaced with the architecture or
your system as detected by yum.</p>

<p>$basearch This will be replaced with your base
architecture in yum. For example, if your $arch is i686 your
$basearch will be i386.</p>

<p>$uuid This will be replaced with a unique but persistent
uuid for this machine. The value that is first generated
will be stored in /var/lib/yum/uuid and reused until this
file is deleted.</p>

<p>$YUM0-$YUM9 These will be replaced with the value of the
shell environment variable of the same name. If the shell
environment variable does not exist then the configuration
file variable will not be replaced.</p>

<p>As of 3.2.28, any properly named file in /etc/yum/vars
is turned into a variable named after the filename (or
overrides any of the above vari- ables). Filenames may
contain only alphanumeric characters and under- scores and
be in lowercase.</p>

<p>Note that no warnings/errors are given if the files are
unreadable, so creating files that only root can read may be
confusing for users.</p>

<p>Also note that only the first line will be read and all
new line char- acters are removed, as a convenience.
However, no other checking is performed on the data. This
means it is possible to have bad character data in any
value.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/yum.conf /etc/yum.repos.d/
/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/ /etc/yum/protected.d
/etc/yum/vars</p>
