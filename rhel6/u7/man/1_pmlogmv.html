<p>NAME pmlogmv - move (rename) Performance Co-Pilot
archive files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmlogmv [-NV] oldname newname</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
consists of mutiple files as cre- ated by pmlogger(1).
pmlogmv allows all the files of a single PCP archive to be
moved or renamed as a group in a single operation.</p>

<p>The oldname argument identifies the target archive, and
may be either the basename that is common to all files in
that archive or one of the archives files. The new archives
basename is newname.</p>

<p>The -N option performs a dry-run, checking and reporting
what changes would be made without making any changes.</p>

<p>Additional reporting verbosity may be requested with the
-V option.</p>

<p>Because PCP archives are important records of system
activity, special care is taken to ensure the integrity of
an archives files. For recoverable problems encountered
during the execution of pmlogmv, all the files associated
with oldname will be preserved, and no new files with the
newname prefix will be created. Recoverable problems include
signals that can be caught (such as SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT
and SIGTERM), permissions issues, new files already
existing, file system full events, etc.</p>

<p>The implementation of pmlogmv uses hard links in the
file system and so follows the semantic restrictions of
ln(2) which for most systems means the directories
containing both the oldname and the newname PCP archive
files need to be writeable and within the same file
system.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ln(2) and pmlogger(1).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS All error and warning messages are intended
to be easily understood and errors produce a non-zero exit
status.</p>
