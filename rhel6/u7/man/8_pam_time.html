<p>NAME pam_time - PAM module for time control access</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pam_time.so [debug] [noaudit]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The pam_time PAM module does not
authenticate the user, but instead it restricts access to a
system and or specific applications at various times of the
day and on specific days or over various terminal lines.
This module can be configured to deny access to (individual)
users based on their name, the time of day, the day of week,
the service they are applying for and their terminal from
which they are making their request.</p>

<p>By default rules for time/port access are taken from
config file /etc/security/time.conf.</p>

<p>If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module
will report when it denies access.</p>

<p>OPTIONS debug Some debug information is printed with
syslog(3).</p>

<p>noaudit Do not report logins at disallowed time to the
audit subsystem.</p>

<p>MODULE TYPES PROVIDED Only the account type is
provided.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES PAM_SUCCESS Access was granted.</p>

<p>PAM_ABORT Not all relevant data could be gotten.</p>

<p>PAM_BUF_ERR Memory buffer error.</p>

<p>PAM_PERM_DENIED Access was not granted.</p>

<p>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN The user is not known to the
system.</p>

<p>FILES /etc/security/time.conf Default configuration
file</p>

<p>EXAMPLES #%PAM-1.0 # # apply pam_time accounting to
