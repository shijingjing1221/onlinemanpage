<p>&lt;signal.h&gt;(0P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
&lt;signal.h&gt;(0P)</p>

<p>NAME signal.h - signals</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Some of the functionality described on this
reference page extends the ISO C standard. Applications
shall define the appropriate feature test macro (see the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Sec- tion
2.2, The Compilation Environment) to enable the visibility
of these symbols in this header.</p>

<p>The &lt;signal.h&gt; header shall define the following
symbolic constants, each of which expands to a distinct
constant expression of the type:</p>

<p>void (*)(int)</p>

<p>whose value matches no declarable function.</p>

<p>SIG_DFL Request for default signal handling.</p>

<p>SIG_ERR Return value from signal() in case of error.</p>

<p>SIG_HOLD Request that signal be held.</p>

<p>SIG_IGN Request that signal be ignored.</p>

<p>The following data types shall be defined through
typedef:</p>

<p>sig_atomic_t Possibly volatile-qualified integer type of
an object that can be accessed as an atomic entity, even in
the presence of asyn- chronous interrupts.</p>

<p>sigset_t Integer or structure type of an object used to
represent sets of signals.</p>

<p>pid_t As described in &lt;sys/types.h&gt; .</p>

<p>The &lt;signal.h&gt; header shall define the sigevent
structure, which has at least the following members:</p>

<p>int sigev_notify Notification type. int sigev_signo
Signal number. union sigval sigev_value Signal value.
void(*)(union sigval) sigev_notify_function Notification
function. (pthread_attr_t *) sigev_notify_attributes
Notification attributes.</p>

<p>The following values of sigev_notify shall be
defined:</p>

<p>SIGEV_NONE No asynchronous notification is delivered
when the event of interest occurs.</p>

<p>SIGEV_SIGNAL A queued signal, with an
application-defined value, is generated when the event of
interest occurs.</p>

<p>SIGEV_THREAD A notification function is called to
perform notification.</p>

<p>The sigval union shall be defined as:</p>

<p>int sival_int Integer signal value. void *sival_ptr
Pointer signal value.</p>

<p>This header shall also declare the macros SIGRTMIN and
SIGRTMAX, which evaluate to integer expressions, and specify
a range of signal numbers that are reserved for application
use and for which the realtime signal behavior specified in
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 is supported. The signal
numbers in this range do not overlap any of the signals
specified in the following table.</p>

<p>The range SIGRTMIN through SIGRTMAX inclusive shall
include at least {RTSIG_MAX} signal numbers.</p>

<p>It is implementation-defined whether realtime signal
behavior is sup- ported for other signals.</p>

<p>This header also declares the constants that are used to
refer to the signals that occur in the system. Signals
defined here begin with the letters SIG. Each of the signals
have distinct positive integer values. The value 0 is
reserved for use as the null signal (see kill()). Addi-
tional implementation-defined signals may occur in the
system.</p>

<p>The ISO C standard only requires the signal names
SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIG- ILL, SIGINT, SIGSEGV, and SIGTERM to
be defined.</p>

<p>The following signals shall be supported on all
implementations (default actions are explained below the
table):</p>

<p>Signal Default Action Description SIGABRT A Process
abort signal. SIGALRM T Alarm clock. SIGBUS A Access to an
undefined portion of a mem- ory object. SIGCHLD I Child
process terminated, stopped, or continued. SIGCONT C
Continue executing, if stopped. SIGFPE A Erroneous
arithmetic operation. SIGHUP T Hangup. SIGILL A Illegal
instruction. SIGINT T Terminal interrupt signal. SIGKILL T
Kill (cannot be caught or ignored). SIGPIPE T Write on a
pipe with no one to read it. SIGQUIT A Terminal quit signal.
SIGSEGV A Invalid memory reference. SIGSTOP S Stop executing
(cannot be caught or ignored). SIGTERM T Termination signal.
SIGTSTP S Terminal stop signal. SIGTTIN S Background process
attempting read. SIGTTOU S Background process attempting
write. SIGUSR1 T User-defined signal 1. SIGUSR2 T
User-defined signal 2. SIGPOLL T Pollable event. SIGPROF T
Profiling timer expired.</p>

<p>SIGSYS A Bad system call. SIGTRAP A Trace/breakpoint
trap. SIGURG I High bandwidth data is available at a socket.
SIGVTALRM T Virtual timer expired. SIGXCPU A CPU time limit
exceeded. SIGXFSZ A File size limit exceeded.</p>

<p>The default actions are as follows:</p>

<p>T Abnormal termination of the process. The process is
terminated with all the consequences of _exit() except that
the status made available to wait() and waitpid() indicates
abnormal termination by the specified signal.</p>

<p>A Abnormal termination of the process. Additionally,
implementation-defined abnormal termination actions, such as
creation of a core file, may occur.</p>

<p>I Ignore the signal.</p>

<p>S Stop the process.</p>

<p>C Continue the process, if it is stopped; otherwise,
ignore the signal.</p>

<p>The header shall provide a declaration of struct
sigaction, including at least the following members:</p>

<p>void (*sa_handler)(int) Pointer to a signal-catching
function or one of the macros SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL. sigset_t
sa_mask Set of signals to be blocked during execution of the
signal handling function. int sa_flags Special flags. void
(*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *) Pointer to a
signal-catching function.</p>

<p>The storage occupied by sa_handler and sa_sigaction may
overlap, and a conforming application shall not use both
simultaneously.</p>

<p>The following shall be declared as constants:</p>

<p>SA_NOCLDSTOP Do not generate SIGCHLD when children stop
or stopped children continue.</p>

<p>SIG_BLOCK The resulting set is the union of the current
set and the signal set pointed to by the argument set.</p>

<p>SIG_UNBLOCK The resulting set is the intersection of the
current set and the complement of the signal set pointed to
by the argument set.</p>

<p>SIG_SETMASK The resulting set is the signal set pointed
to by the argument set.</p>

<p>SA_ONSTACK Causes signal delivery to occur on an
alternate stack.</p>

<p>SA_RESETHAND Causes signal dispositions to be set to
SIG_DFL on entry to sig- nal handlers.</p>

<p>SA_RESTART Causes certain functions to become
restartable.</p>

<p>SA_SIGINFO Causes extra information to be passed to
signal handlers at the time of receipt of a signal.</p>

<p>SA_NOCLDWAIT Causes implementations not to create zombie
processes on child death.</p>

<p>SA_NODEFER Causes signal not to be automatically blocked
on entry to signal handler.</p>

<p>SS_ONSTACK Process is executing on an alternate signal
stack.</p>

<p>SS_DISABLE Alternate signal stack is disabled.</p>

<p>MINSIGSTKSZ Minimum stack size for a signal handler.</p>

<p>SIGSTKSZ Default size in bytes for the alternate signal
stack.</p>

<p>The ucontext_t structure shall be defined through
typedef as described in &lt;ucontext.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The mcontext_t type shall be defined through typedef as
described in &lt;ucontext.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The &lt;signal.h&gt; header shall define the stack_t
type as a structure that includes at least the following
members:</p>

<p>void *ss_sp Stack base or pointer. size_t ss_size Stack
size. int ss_flags Flags.</p>

<p>The &lt;signal.h&gt; header shall define the sigstack
structure that includes at least the following members:</p>

<p>int ss_onstack Non-zero when signal stack is in use.
void *ss_sp Signal stack pointer.</p>

<p>The &lt;signal.h&gt; header shall define the siginfo_t
type as a structure that includes at least the following
members:</p>

<p>int si_signo Signal number.</p>

<p>int si_errno If non-zero, an errno value associated with
this signal, as defined in &lt;errno.h&gt;.</p>

<p>int si_code Signal code.</p>

<p>pid_t si_pid Sending process ID. uid_t si_uid Real user
ID of sending process. void *si_addr Address of faulting
instruction. int si_status Exit value or signal. long
si_band Band event for SIGPOLL.</p>

<p>union sigval si_value Signal value.</p>

<p>The macros specified in the Code column of the following
table are defined for use as values of si_code that are
signal-specific or non- signal-specific reasons why the

<p>Implementations may support additional si_code values
not included in this list, may generate values included in
this list under circum- stances other than those described
in this list, and may contain exten- sions or limitations
that prevent some values from being generated.
Implementations do not generate a different value from the
ones described in this list for circumstances described in
this list.</p>
