<p>CUT(1P) POSIX Programmer s Manual CUT(1P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME cut - cut out selected fields of each line of a
file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS cut -b list [-n] [file ...]</p>

<p>cut -c list [file ...]</p>

<p>cut -f list [-d delim][-s][file ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The cut utility shall cut out bytes ( -b
option), characters ( -c option), or character-delimited
fields ( -f option) from each line in one or more files,
concatenate them, and write them to standard output.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The cut utility shall conform to the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2,
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the option-argument
list (see options -b, -c, and -f below) is a comma-separated
list or &lt;blank&gt;-separated list of positive numbers and
ranges. Ranges can be in three forms. The first is two
positive numbers separated by a hyphen ( low- high), which
represents all fields from the first number to the second
number. The second is a positive number preceded by a hyphen
(- high), which repre- sents all fields from field number 1
to that number. The third is a positive number followed by a
hyphen ( low-), which represents that number to the last
field, inclusive. The elements in list can be repeated, can
overlap, and can be specified in any order, but the bytes,
characters, or fields selected shall be written in the order
of the input data. If an element appears in the selection
list more than once, it shall be written exactly once.</p>

<p>The following options shall be supported:</p>

<p>-b list Cut based on a list of bytes. Each selected byte
shall be output unless the -n option is also specified. It
shall not be an error to select bytes not present in the
input line.</p>

<p>-c list Cut based on a list of characters. Each selected
character shall be output. It shall not be an error to
select characters not present in the input line.</p>

<p>-d delim Set the field delimiter to the character delim.
The default is the &lt;tab&gt;.</p>

<p>-f list Cut based on a list of fields, assumed to be
separated in the file by a delimiter character (see -d).
Each selected field shall be output. Output fields shall be
separated by a single occurrence of the field delimiter
character. Lines with no field delimiters shall be passed
through intact, unless -s is specified. It shall not be an
error to select fields not present in the input line.</p>

<p>-n Do not split characters. When specified with the -b
option, each element in list of the form low- high
(hyphen-separated numbers) shall be modified as follows:</p>

<p>* If the byte selected by low is not the first byte of a
char- acter, low shall be decremented to select the first
byte of the character originally selected by low. If the
byte selected by high is not the last byte of a character,
high shall be decremented to select the last byte of the
character prior to the character originally selected by
high, or zero if there is no prior character. If the
resulting range ele- ment has high equal to zero or low
greater than high, the list element shall be dropped from
list for that input line without causing an error.</p>

<p>Each element in list of the form low- shall be treated
as above with high set to the number of bytes in the current
line, not including the terminating &lt;newline&gt;. Each
element in list of the form - high shall be treated as above
with low set to 1. Each element in list of the form num (a
single number) shall be treated as above with low set to num
and high set to num.</p>

<p>-s Suppress lines with no delimiter characters, when
used with the -f option. Unless specified, lines with no
delimiters shall be passed through untouched.</p>

<p>OPERANDS The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p>file A pathname of an input file. If no file operands
are specified, or if a file operand is, the standard input
shall be used.</p>

<p>STDIN The standard input shall be used only if no file
operands are speci- fied, or if a file operand is- . See the
INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p>INPUT FILES The input files shall be text files, except
that line lengths shall be unlimited.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The following environment
variables shall affect the execution of cut:</p>

<p>LANG Provide a default value for the
internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See
the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
8.2, Internationalization Vari- ables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values
of locale categories.)</p>

<p>LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the
values of all the other internationalization variables.</p>

<p>LC_CTYPE Determine the locale for the interpretation of
sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example,
single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments
and input files).</p>

<p>LC_MESSAGES Determine the locale that should be used to
affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages
written to standard error.</p>

<p>NLSPATH Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES .</p>

<p>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS Default.</p>

<p>STDOUT The cut utility output shall be a concatenation
of the selected bytes, characters, or fields (one of the
following):</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;concatenation of bytes&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;concatenation of characters&gt;</p>

<p>&quot;%n&quot;, &lt;concatenation of fields and field
delimiters&gt;</p>

<p>STDERR The standard error shall be used only for
diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>OUTPUT FILES None.</p>

<p>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION None.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values shall be
returned:</p>

<p>0 All input files were output successfully.</p>

<p>&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS Default.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Earlier versions of the cut utility
worked in an environment where bytes and characters were
considered equivalent (modulo &lt;backspace&gt; and
&lt;tab&gt; processing in some implementations). In the
extended world of multi-byte characters, the new -b option
has been added. The -n option (used with -b) allows it to be
used to act on bytes rounded to charac- ter boundaries. The
algorithm specified for -n guarantees that:</p>

<p>cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1 cut -b 501- -n file &gt;
file2</p>

<p>ends up with all the characters in file appearing
exactly once in file1 or file2. (There is, however, a
&lt;newline&gt; in both file1 and file2 for each
&lt;newline&gt; in file.)</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Examples of the option qualifier list:</p>

<p>1,4,7 Select the first, fourth, and seventh bytes,
characters, or fields and field delimiters.</p>

<p>1-3,8 Equivalent to 1,2,3,8.</p>

<p>-5,10 Equivalent to 1,2,3,4,5,10.</p>

<p>3- Equivalent to third to last, inclusive.</p>

<p>The low- high forms are not always equivalent when used
with -b and -n and multi-byte characters; see the
description of -n.</p>

<p>The following command:</p>

<p>cut -d : -f 1,6 /etc/passwd</p>

<p>reads the System V password file (user database) and
produces lines of the form:</p>

<p>&lt;user ID&gt;:&lt;home directory&gt;</p>

<p>Most utilities in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
work on text files. The cut utility can be used to turn
files with arbitrary line lengths into a set of text files
containing the same data. The paste utility can be used to
create (or recreate) files with arbitrary line lengths. For
example, if file contains long lines:</p>

<p>cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1 cut -b 501- -n file &gt;
file2</p>

<p>creates file1 (a text file) with lines no longer than
500 bytes (plus the &lt;newline&gt;) and file2 that contains
the remainder of the data from file. (Note that file2 is not
a text file if there are lines in file that are longer than
500 + {LINE_MAX} bytes.) The original file can be recreated
from file1 and file2 using the command:</p>

<p>paste -d 0&quot; file1 file2 &gt; file</p>

<p>RATIONALE Some historical implementations do not count
&lt;backspace&gt;s in determin- ing character counts with
the -c option. This may be useful for using cut for
processing nroff output. It was deliberately decided not to
have the -c option treat either &lt;backspace&gt;s or
&lt;tab&gt;s in any special fashion. The fold utility does
treat these characters specially.</p>

<p>Unlike other utilities, some historical implementations
of cut exit after not finding an input file, rather than
continuing to process the remaining file operands. This
behavior is prohibited by this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, where only the exit status is affected by this
problem.</p>

<p>The behavior of cut when provided with either
mutually-exclusive options or options that do not work
logically together has been delib- erately left unspecified
in favor of global wording in Utility Descrip- tion Defaults
.</p>

<p>The OPTIONS section was changed in response to IEEE PASC
Interpretation 1003.2 #149. The change represents historical
practice on all known systems. The original standard was
ambiguous on the nature of the out- put.</p>

<p>The list option-arguments are historically used to
select the portions of the line to be written, but do not
affect the order of the data. For example:</p>

<p>echo abcdefghi | cut -c6,2,4-7,1</p>

<p>yields &quot;abdefg&quot; .</p>

<p>A proposal to enhance cut with the following option:</p>

<p>-o Preserve the selected field order. When this option
is speci- fied, each byte, character, or field (or ranges of
such) shall be written in the order specified by the list
option-argument, even if this requires multiple outputs of
the same bytes, char- acters, or fields.</p>

<p>was rejected because this type of enhancement is outside
the scope of the IEEE P1003.2b draft standard.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
