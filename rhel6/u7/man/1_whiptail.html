<p>DESCRIPTION whiptail is a program that will let you
present a variety of questions or display messages using
dialog boxes from a shell script. Currently, these types of
dialog boxes are implemented:</p>

<p>yes/no box, menu box, input box, message box, text box,
info box, checklist box, radiolist box gauge box, and
password box.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --clear The screen will be cleared to the screen
attribute on exit. This doesnt work in an xterm (and
descendants) if alternate screen switching is enabled,
because in that case slang writes to (and clears) an
alternate screen.</p>

<p>--defaultno The dialog box will open with the cursor
over the No button.</p>

<p>--default-item string Set the default item in a menu
box. Normally the first item in the box is the default.</p>

<p>--fb Use full buttons. (By default, whiptail uses
compact buttons).</p>

<p>--nocancel The dialog box wont have a Cancel button.</p>

<p>--yes-button text Set the text of the Yes button.</p>

<p>--no-button text Set the text of the No button.</p>

<p>--ok-button text Set the text of the Ok button.</p>

<p>--cancel-button text Set the text of the Cancel
button.</p>

<p>--noitem The menu, checklist and radiolist widgets will
display tags only, not the item strings. The menu widget
still needs some items specified, but checklist and
radiolist expect only tag and status.</p>

<p>--separate-output For checklist widgets, output result
one line at a time, with no quoting. This facilitates
parsing by another program.</p>

<p>--output-fd fd Direct output to the given file
descriptor. Most whiptail scripts write to standard error,
but error messages may also be written there, depending on
your script.</p>

<p>--title title Specifies a title string to be displayed
at the top of the dia- log box.</p>

<p>--backtitle backtitle Specifies a backtitle string to be
displayed on the backdrop, at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>--scrolltext Force the display of a vertical
scrollbar.</p>

<p>--topleft Put window in top-left corner.</p>

<p>Box Options</p>

<p>--yesno text height width A yes/no dialog box of size
height rows by width columns will be displayed. The string
specified by text is displayed inside the dialog box. If
this string is too long to be fit in one line, it will be
automatically divided into multiple lines at appropriate
places. The text string may also contain the sub-string
&quot;n&quot; or newline characters n_ to control line
breaking explicitly. This dialog box is useful for asking
questions that require the user to answer either yes or no.
The dialog box has a Yes but- ton and a No button, in which
the user can switch between by pressing the TAB key.</p>

<p>--msgbox text height width A message box is very similar
to a yes/no box. The only differ- ence between a message box
and a yes/no box is that a message box has only a single OK
button. You can use this dialog box to display any message
you like. After reading the message, the user can press the
ENTER key so that whiptail will exit and the calling shell
script can continue its operation.</p>

<p>--infobox text height width An info box is basically a
message box. However, in this case, whiptail will exit
immediately after displaying the message to the user. The
screen is not cleared when whiptail exits, so that the
message will remain on the screen until the calling shell
script clears it later. This is useful when you want to
inform the user that some operations are carrying on that
may require some time to finish.</p>

<p>--inputbox text height width [init] An input box is
useful when you want to ask questions that require the user
to input a string as the answer. If init is supplied it is
used to initialize the input string. When input- ing the
string, the BACKSPACE key can be used to correct typing
errors. If the input string is longer than the width of the
dia- log box, the input field will be scrolled. On exit, the
input string will be printed on stderr.</p>

<p>--passwordbox text height width [init] A password box is
similar to an input box, except the text the user enters is
not displayed. This is useful when prompting for passwords
or other sensitive information. Be aware that if any- thing
is passed in &quot;init&quot;, it will be visible in the
systems process table to casual snoopers. Also, it is very
confusing to the user to provide them with a default
password they cannot see. For these reasons, using
&quot;init&quot; is highly discouraged.</p>

<p>--textbox file height width A text box lets you display
the contents of a text file in a dialog box. It is like a
simple text file viewer. The user can move through the file
by using the UP/DOWN, PGUP/PGDN and HOME/END keys available
on most keyboards. If the lines are too long to be displayed
in the box, the LEFT/RIGHT keys can be used to scroll the
text region horizontally. For more convenience, forward and
backward searching functions are also provided.</p>

<p>--menu text height width menu-height [ tag item ] ... As
its name suggests, a menu box is a dialog box that can be
used to present a list of choices in the form of a menu for
the user to choose. Each menu entry consists of a tag string
and an item string. The tag gives the entry a name to
distinguish it from the other entries in the menu. The item
is a short descrip- tion of the option that the entry
represents. The user can move between the menu entries by
pressing the UP/DOWN keys, the first letter of the tag as a
hot-key. There are menu-height entries displayed in the menu
at one time, but the menu will be scrolled if there are more
entries than that. When whiptail exits, the tag of the
chosen menu entry will be printed on stderr.</p>

<p>--checklist text height width list-height [ tag item
status ] ... A checklist box is similar to a menu box in
that there are mul- tiple entries presented in the form of a
menu. You can select and deselect items using the SPACE key.
The initial on/off state of each entry is specified by
status. On exit, a list of the tag strings of those entries
that are turned on will be printed on stderr.</p>

<p>--radiolist text height width list-height [ tag item
status ] ... A radiolist box is similar to a menu box. The
only difference is that you can indicate which entry is
currently selected, by setting its status to on.</p>

<p>--gauge text height width percent A gauge box displays a
meter along the bottom of the box. The meter indicates a
percentage. New percentages are read from standard input,
one integer per line. The meter is updated to reflect each
new percentage. If stdin is XXX, then subsequent lines up to
another XXX are used for a new prompt. The gauge exits when
EOF is reached on stdin.</p>

<p>NOTES whiptail interprets arguments starting with a dash
&quot;-&quot; as being argu- ments. To avoid this, and start
some text in, for example, a menubox item, with a dash,
whiptail honours the getopt convention of accepting the
special argument &quot;--&quot; which means that all
following arguments with dashes are to be treated verbatim
and not parsed as options.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS Exit status is 0 if whiptail is exited by
pressing the Yes or OK but- ton, and 1 if the No or Cancel
button is pressed. Otherwise, if errors occur inside
whiptail or whiptail is exited by pressing the ESC key, the
exit status is -1.</p>
