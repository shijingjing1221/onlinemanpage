<p>SIGACTION(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual
SIGACTION(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME sigaction - examine and change a signal action</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;signal.h&gt;</p>

<p>int sigaction(int sig, const struct sigaction *restrict
act, struct sigaction *restrict oact);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The sigaction() function allows the calling
process to examine and/or specify the action to be
associated with a specific signal. The argu- ment sig
specifies the signal; acceptable values are defined in
&lt;sig- nal.h&gt;.</p>

<p>The structure sigaction, used to describe an action to
be taken, is defined in the &lt;signal.h&gt; header to
include at least the following mem- bers:</p>

<p>Member Type Member Name Description void(*) (int)
sa_handler Pointer to a signal-catching function or one of
the macros SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL. sigset_t sa_mask Additional
set of signals to be blocked during execution of
signal-catching function. int sa_flags Special flags to
affect behav- ior of signal. void(*) (int, siginfo_t *,
sa_sigaction Pointer to a signal-catching void *)
function.</p>

<p>The storage occupied by sa_handler and sa_sigaction may
overlap, and a conforming application shall not use both
simultaneously.</p>

<p>If the argument act is not a null pointer, it points to
a structure specifying the action to be associated with the
specified signal. If the argument oact is not a null
pointer, the action previously associ- ated with the signal
is stored in the location pointed to by the argu- ment oact.
If the argument act is a null pointer, signal handling is
unchanged; thus, the call can be used to enquire about the
current han- dling of a given signal. The SIGKILL and
SIGSTOP signals shall not be added to the signal mask using
this mechanism; this restriction shall be enforced by the
system without causing an error to be indicated.</p>

<p>If the SA_SIGINFO flag (see below) is cleared in the
sa_flags field of the sigaction structure, the sa_handler
field identifies the action to be associated with the
specified signal. If the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in the
sa_flags field, and the implementation supports the Realtime
Signals Extension option or the XSI Extension option, the
sa_sigaction field specifies a signal-catching function. If
the SA_SIGINFO bit is cleared and the sa_handler field
specifies a signal-catching function, or if the SA_SIGINFO
bit is set, the sa_mask field identifies a set of signals
that shall be added to the signal mask of the thread before
the signal-catching function is invoked. If the sa_handler
field specifies a signal-catching function, the sa_mask
field identifies a set of sig- nals that shall be added to
the process signal mask before the signal- catching function
is invoked.</p>

<p>The sa_flags field can be used to modify the behavior of
the specified signal.</p>

<p>The following flags, defined in the &lt;signal.h&gt;
header, can be set in sa_flags:</p>

<p>SA_NOCLDSTOP Do not generate SIGCHLD when children stop
or stopped children continue.</p>

<p>If sig is SIGCHLD and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is not set
in sa_flags, and the implementation supports the SIGCHLD
signal, then a SIGCHLD signal shall be generated for the
calling process whenever any of its child processes stop and
a SIGCHLD signal may be generated for the calling process
whenever any of its stopped child processes are continued.
If sig is SIGCHLD and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is set in
sa_flags, then the implementation shall not generate a
SIGCHLD signal in this way.</p>

<p>SA_ONSTACK If set and an alternate signal stack has been
declared with sigaltstack(), the signal shall be delivered
to the calling pro- cess on that stack. Otherwise, the
signal shall be delivered on the current stack.</p>

<p>SA_RESETHAND If set, the disposition of the signal shall
be reset to SIG_DFL and the SA_SIGINFO flag shall be cleared
on entry to the signal handler.</p>

<p>Note: SIGILL and SIGTRAP cannot be automatically reset
when delivered; the system silently enforces this
restriction.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the disposition of the signal shall not be
modified on entry to the signal handler.</p>

<p>In addition, if this flag is set, sigaction() behaves as
if the SA_NODEFER flag were also set.</p>

<p>SA_RESTART This flag affects the behavior of
interruptible functions; that is, those specified to fail
with errno set to [EINTR]. If set, and a function specified
as interruptible is interrupted by this signal, the function
shall restart and shall not fail with [EINTR] unless
otherwise specified. If the flag is not set, interruptible
functions interrupted by this signal shall fail with errno
set to [EINTR].</p>

<p>SA_SIGINFO If cleared and the signal is caught, the
signal-catching func- tion shall be entered as:</p>

<p>void func(int signo);</p>

<p>where signo is the only argument to the signal-catching
function. In this case, the application shall use the
sa_handler member to describe the signal-catching function
and the application shall not modify the sa_sigaction
member.</p>

<p>If SA_SIGINFO is set and the signal is caught, the
signal-catching function shall be entered as:</p>

<p>void func(int signo, siginfo_t *info, void
*context);</p>

<p>where two additional arguments are passed to the
signal-catching func- tion. The second argument shall point
to an object of type siginfo_t explaining the reason why the
signal was generated; the third argument can be cast to a
pointer to an object of type ucontext_t to refer to the
receiving process context that was interrupted when the
signal was delivered. In this case, the application shall
use the sa_sigaction member to describe the signal-catching
function and the application shall not modify the sa_handler
member.</p>

<p>The si_signo member contains the system-generated signal
number.</p>

<p>The si_errno member may contain implementation-defined
additional error information; if non-zero, it contains an
error number identifying the condition that caused the
signal to be generated.</p>

<p>The si_code member contains a code identifying the cause
of the signal.</p>

<p>If the value of si_code is less than or equal to 0, then
the signal was generated by a process and si_pid and si_uid,
respectively, indicate the process ID and the real user ID
of the sender. The &lt;signal.h&gt; header description
contains information about the signal-specific con- tents of
the elements of the siginfo_t type.</p>

<p>SA_NOCLDWAIT If set, and sig equals SIGCHLD, child
processes of the calling processes shall not be transformed
into zombie processes when they terminate. If the calling
process subsequently waits for its children, and the process
has no unwaited-for children that were transformed into
zombie processes, it shall block until all of its children
terminate, and wait(), waitid(), and waitpid() shall fail
and set errno to [ECHILD]. Otherwise, terminating child
processes shall be transformed into zombie processes, unless
SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN.</p>

<p>SA_NODEFER If set and sig is caught, sig shall not be
added to the process signal mask on entry to the signal
handler unless it is included in sa_mask. Otherwise, sig
shall always be added to the process signal mask on entry to
the signal handler.</p>

<p>When a signal is caught by a signal-catching function
installed by sigaction(), a new signal mask is calculated
and installed for the duration of the signal-catching
function (or until a call to either sigprocmask() or
sigsuspend() is made). This mask is formed by taking the
union of the current signal mask and the value of the
sa_mask for the signal being delivered unless SA_NODEFER or
SA_RESETHAND is set, and then including the signal being
delivered. If and when the users signal handler returns
normally, the original signal mask is restored.</p>

<p>Once an action is installed for a specific signal, it
shall remain installed until another action is explicitly
requested (by another call to sigaction()), until the
SA_RESETHAND flag causes resetting of the handler, or until
one of the exec functions is called.</p>

<p>If the previous action for sig had been established by
signal(), the values of the fields returned in the structure
pointed to by oact are unspecified, and in particular
oact-&gt; sa_handler is not necessarily the same value
passed to signal(). However, if a pointer to the same
structure or a copy thereof is passed to a subsequent call
to sigac- tion() via the act argument, handling of the
signal shall be as if the original call to signal() were
repeated.</p>

<p>If sigaction() fails, no new signal handler is
installed.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether an attempt to set the action
for a signal that cannot be caught or ignored to SIG_DFL is
ignored or causes an error to be returned with errno set to
[EINVAL].</p>

<p>If SA_SIGINFO is not set in sa_flags, then the
disposition of subse- quent occurrences of sig when it is
already pending is implementation- defined; the
signal-catching function shall be invoked with a single
argument. If the implementation supports the Realtime
Signals Exten- sion option, and if SA_SIGINFO is set in
sa_flags, then subsequent occurrences of sig generated by
sigqueue() or as a result of any sig- nal-generating
function that supports the specification of an applica-
tion-defined value (when sig is already pending) shall be
queued in FIFO order until delivered or accepted; the
signal-catching function shall be invoked with three
arguments. The application specified value is passed to the
signal-catching function as the si_value member of the
siginfo_t structure.</p>

<p>The result of the use of sigaction() and a sigwait()
function concur- rently within a process on the same signal
is unspecified.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE Upon successful completion, sigaction()
shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned, errno shall
be set to indicate the error, and no new signal-catching
function shall be installed.</p>

<p>ERRORS The sigaction() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The sig argument is not a valid signal number or
an attempt is made to catch a signal that cannot be caught
or ignore a signal that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>ENOTSUP The SA_SIGINFO bit flag is set in the sa_flags
field of the sigaction structure, and the implementation
does not support either the Realtime Signals Extension
option, or the XSI Exten- sion option.</p>

<p>The sigaction() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL An attempt was made to set the action to SIG_DFL
for a signal that cannot be caught or ignored (or both).</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES None.</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE The sigaction() function supersedes
the signal() function, and should be used in preference. In
particular, sigaction() and signal() should not be used in
the same process to control the same signal. The behav- ior
of reentrant functions, as defined in the DESCRIPTION, is as
speci- fied by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
regardless of invocation from a signal-catching function.
This is the only intended meaning of the statement that
reentrant functions may be used in signal-catching functions
without restrictions. Applications must still consider all
effects of such functions on such things as data structures,
files, and process state. In particular, application writers
need to consider the restrictions on interactions when
interrupting sleep() and interactions among multiple handles
for a file description. The fact that any specific function
is listed as reentrant does not necessarily mean that
invocation of that function from a signal-catching function
is recom- mended.</p>

<p>In order to prevent errors arising from interrupting
non-reentrant function calls, applications should protect
calls to these functions either by blocking the appropriate
signals or through the use of some programmatic semaphore
(see semget(), sem_init(), sem_open(), and so on). Note in
particular that even the &quot;safe&quot; functions may
modify errno; the signal-catching function, if not executing
as an independent thread, may want to save and restore its
value. Naturally, the same principles apply to the
reentrancy of application routines and asyn- chronous data
access. Note that longjmp() and siglongjmp() are not in the
list of reentrant functions. This is because the code
executing after longjmp() and siglongjmp() can call any
unsafe functions with the same danger as calling those
unsafe functions directly from the signal handler.
Applications that use longjmp() and siglongjmp() from within
signal handlers require rigorous protection in order to be
portable. Many of the other functions that are excluded from
the list are tradi- tionally implemented using either
malloc() or free() functions or the standard I/O library,
both of which traditionally use data structures in a
non-reentrant manner. Since any combination of different
functions using a common data structure can cause reentrancy
problems, this vol- ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not
define the behavior when any unsafe function is called in a
signal handler that interrupts an unsafe function.</p>

<p>If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling
abort(), kill(), or raise(), the behavior is undefined if
the signal handler calls any function in the standard
library other than one of the func- tions listed in the
table above or refers to any object with static storage
duration other than by assigning a value to a static storage
duration variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t.
Furthermore, if such a call fails, the value of errno is
unspecified.</p>

<p>Usually, the signal is executed on the stack that was in
effect before the signal was delivered. An alternate stack
may be specified to receive a subset of the signals being
caught.</p>

<p>When the signal handler returns, the receiving process
resumes execu- tion at the point it was interrupted unless
the signal handler makes other arrangements. If longjmp() or
_longjmp() is used to leave the signal handler, then the
signal mask must be explicitly restored by the process.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 defines the third
argument of a signal handling function when SA_SIGINFO is
set as a void * instead of a ucontext_t *, but without
requiring type checking. New applications should explicitly
cast the third argument of the signal handling func- tion to
ucontext_t *.</p>

<p>The BSD optional four argument signal handling function
is not sup- ported by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
The BSD declaration would be:</p>

<p>void handler(int sig, int code, struct sigcontext *scp,
char *addr);</p>

<p>where sig is the signal number, code is additional
information on cer- tain signals, scp is a pointer to the
sigcontext structure, and addr is additional address
information. Much the same information is available in the
objects pointed to by the second argument of the signal
handler specified when SA_SIGINFO is set.</p>

<p>RATIONALE Although this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
requires that signals that cannot be ignored shall not be
added to the signal mask when a signal- catching function is
entered, there is no explicit requirement that subsequent
calls to sigaction() reflect this in the information
returned in the oact argument. In other words, if SIGKILL is
included in the sa_mask field of act, it is unspecified
whether or not a subse- quent call to sigaction() returns
with SIGKILL included in the sa_mask field of oact.</p>

<p>The SA_NOCLDSTOP flag, when supplied in the act-&gt;
sa_flags parameter, allows overloading SIGCHLD with the
System V semantics that each SIGCLD signal indicates a
single terminated child. Most conforming applica- tions that
catch SIGCHLD are expected to install signal-catching func-
tions that repeatedly call the waitpid() function with the
WNOHANG flag set, acting on each child for which status is
returned, until waitpid() returns zero. If stopped children
are not of interest, the use of the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag can
prevent the overhead from invoking the signal- catching
routine when they stop.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations also define other
mechanisms for stop- ping processes, such as the ptrace()
function. These implementations usually do not generate a
SIGCHLD signal when processes stop due to this mechanism;
however, that is beyond the scope of this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that calls
to sigaction() that supply a NULL act argument succeed, even
in the case of signals that cannot be caught or ignored
(that is, SIGKILL or SIGSTOP). The System V signal() and BSD
sigvec() functions return [EINVAL] in these cases and, in
this respect, their behavior varies from sigaction().</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that
sigaction() properly save and restore a signal action set up
by the ISO C standard signal() function. However, there is
no guarantee that the reverse is true, nor could there be
given the greater amount of information conveyed by the
sigaction structure. Because of this, applications should
avoid using both functions for the same signal in the same
process. Since this can- not always be avoided in case of
general-purpose library routines, they should always be
implemented with sigaction().</p>

<p>It was intended that the signal() function should be
implementable as a library routine using sigaction().</p>

<p>The POSIX Realtime Extension extends the sigaction()
function as speci- fied by the POSIX.1-1990 standard to
allow the application to request on a per-signal basis via
an additional signal action flag that the extra parameters,
including the application-defined signal value, if any, be
passed to the signal-catching function.</p>
