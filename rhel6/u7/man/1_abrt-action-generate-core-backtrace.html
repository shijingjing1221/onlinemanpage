<p>NAME abrt-action-generate-core-backtrace - Generates
coredump-level (debuginfo-free) backtrace</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS abrt-action-generate-core-backtrace [-v] [-d
DIR]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This tool uses coredump from the file
coredump and binary at the path stored in file executable in
the problem directory to generate coredump-level
backtrace.</p>

<p>Coredump-level backtrace resembles ordinary backtrace in
that it contains information about call frames present on
the stack at the time of the crash. However, it only
contains information that can be obtained from the coredump
without debugging symbols available - mainly relative
addresses of the stored instruction pointers. Such backtrace
can still be useful for reporting and reproducing the bug
and does not require debugging information files to be
installed. See FILE FORMAT for the description of the
generated file.</p>

<p>The result is saved in the problem directory in a file
named core_backtrace.</p>

<p>Integration with libreport events
abrt-action-generate-core-backtrace can be used as an
analyzer for application crashes which dump core.</p>

<p>Example usage in report_event.conf:</p>

<p>EVENT=analyze analyzer=CCpp
abrt-action-generate-core-backtrace</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d DIR Path to problem directory.</p>

<p>-v Be more verbose. Can be given multiple times.</p>

<p>FILE FORMAT The generated file is a text file containing
one line for each stack frame of the thread that most likely
caused the crash. The line has following format:</p>

<p>BUILD_ID OFFSET SYMBOL MODNAME FINGERPRINT</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>BUILD_ID Build ID of the binary file the address is
mapped to as a hexadecimal string.</p>

<p>OFFSET Offset from the start of the executable section
of aforementioned file the stored instruction pointer points
to. Number in hexadecimal format.</p>

<p>SYMBOL Name of the function if it is present in the
binary (which is often the case for shared libraries).</p>

<p>MODNAME Name of the module. Contains name of a library
or [exe] if it is the executable.</p>

<p>FINGERPRINT Fingerprint of the function the instruction
pointer points to. Not yet implemented.</p>

<p>Dash in place of any of the parts indicates that the
part is unknown.</p>
