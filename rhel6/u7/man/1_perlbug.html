editor ] [ -c adminaddress | -C ] [ -S ] [ -t ] [ -d ] [ -A
] [ -h ] [ -T ]</p>

<p>perlbug [ -v ] [ -r returnaddress ] [ -A ] [ -ok | -okay
| -nok | -nokay ]</p>

<p>perlthanks</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This program is designed to help you
generate and send bug reports (and thank-you notes) about
perl5 and the modules which ship with it.</p>

<p>In most cases, you can just run it interactively from a
command line without any special arguments and follow the
prompts.</p>

<p>If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one
that was not part of the standard distribution), a binary
distribution, or a non-core module (such as Tk, DBI, etc),
then please see the documentation that came with that
distribution to determine the correct place to report
bugs.</p>

<p>If you are unable to send your report using perlbug
(most likely because your system doesnt have a way to send
mail that perlbug recognizes), you may be able to use this
tool to compose your report and save it to a file which you
can then send to perlbug@perl.org using your regular mail
client.</p>

<p>In extreme cases, perlbug may not work well enough on
your system to guide you through composing a bug report. In
those cases, you may be able to use perlbug -d to get system
configuration information to include in a manually composed
bug report to perlbug@perl.org.</p>

<p>When reporting a bug, please run through this
checklist:</p>

<p>What version of Perl you are running? Type &quot;perl
-v&quot; at the command line to find out.</p>

<p>Are you running the latest released version of perl?
Look at http://www.perl.org/ to find out. If you are not
using the latest released version, please try to replicate
your bug on the latest stable release.</p>

<p>Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl,
especially those which indicate you haven t also tested the
current stable release of Perl, are likely to receive less
attention from the volunteers who build and maintain Perl
than reports about bugs in the current release.</p>

<p>This tool isn t apropriate for reporting bugs in any
version prior to Perl 5.0.</p>

<p>Are you sure what you have is a bug? A significant
number of the bug reports we get turn out to be documented
features in Perl. Make sure the issue you ve run into isnt
intentional by glancing through the documentation that comes
with the Perl distribution.</p>

<p>Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn t
a trivial undertaking, but if you can point to documentation
that suggests the behaviour you re seeing is wrong, your
issue is likely to receive more attention. You may want to
start with perldoc perltrap for pointers to common traps
that new (and experienced) Perl programmers run into.</p>

<p>If youre unsure of the meaning of an error message you
ve run across, perldoc perldiag for an explanation. If the
message isnt in perldiag, it probably isnt generated by
Perl. You may have luck consulting your operating system
documentation instead.</p>

<p>If you are on a non-UNIX platform perldoc perlport, as
some features may be unimplemented or work differently.</p>

<p>You may be able to figure out whats going wrong using
the Perl debugger. For information about how to use the
debugger perldoc perldebug.</p>

<p>Do you have a proper test case? The easier it is to
reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be fixed -- if
nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably wont be
addressed.</p>

<p>A good test case has most of these attributes: short,
simple code; few dependencies on external commands, modules,
or libraries; no platform-dependent code (unless it s a
platform-specific bug); clear, simple documentation.</p>

<p>A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be
included in Perl s test suite. If you have the time,
consider writing your test case so that it can be easily
included into the standard test suite.</p>

<p>Have you included all relevant information? Be sure to
include the exact error messages, if any. &quot;Perl gave an
error&quot; is not an exact error message.</p>

<p>If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a
debugger (dbx, gdb, etc) to produce a stack trace to include
in the bug report.</p>

<p>NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info
(often -g), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to
use because it will most probably contain only the function
names and not their arguments. If possible, recompile your
Perl with debug info and reproduce the crash and the stack
trace.</p>

<p>Can you describe the bug in plain English? The easier it
is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely it will
be fixed. Any insight you can provide into the problem will
help a great deal. In other words, try to analyze the
problem (to the extent you can) and report your
discoveries.</p>

<p>Can you fix the bug yourself? A bug report which
includes a patch to fix it will almost definitely be fixed.
When sending a patch, please use the &quot;diff&quot;
program with the &quot;-u&quot; option to generate
&quot;unified&quot; diff files. Bug reports with patches are
likely to receive significantly more attention and interest
than those without patches.</p>

<p>Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or
requests for more detailed explanations about your fix.</p>

<p>Here are a few hints for creating high-quality
patches:</p>

<p>Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument
to diff is typically the original file, the second argument
your changed file). Make sure you test your patch by
applying it with the &quot;patch&quot; program before you
send it on its way. Try to follow the same style as the code
you are trying to patch. Make sure your patch really does
work (&quot;make test&quot;, if the thing you re patching is
covered by Perls test suite).</p>

<p>Can you use &quot;perlbug&quot; to submit the report?
perlbug will, amongst other things, ensure your report
includes crucial information about your version of perl. If
&quot;perlbug&quot; is unable to mail your report after you
have typed it in, you may have to compose the message
yourself, add the output produced by &quot;perlbug -d&quot;
and email it to perlbug@perl.org. If, for some reason, you
cannot run &quot;perlbug&quot; at all on your system, be
sure to include the entire output produced by running
&quot;perl -V&quot; (note the uppercase V).</p>

<p>Whether you use &quot;perlbug&quot; or send the email
manually, please make your Subject line informative. &quot;a
bug&quot; is not informative. Neither is &quot;perl
crashes&quot; nor is &quot;HELP!!!&quot;. These don t help.
A compact description of whats wrong is fine.</p>

<p>Can you use &quot;perlbug&quot; to submit a thank-you
note? Yes, you can do this by either using the
&quot;-T&quot; option, or by invoking the program as
&quot;perlthanks&quot;. Thank-you notes are good. It makes
people smile.</p>

<p>Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be
told the bug is in your code, or possibly to get no reply at
all. The volunteers who maintain Perl are busy folks, so if
your problem is an obvious bug in your own code, is
difficult to understand or is a duplicate of an existing
report, you may not receive a personal reply.</p>

<p>If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do
monitor the perl5-porters@perl.org mailing list and the
commit logs to development versions of Perl, and encourage
the maintainers with kind words or offers of frosty
beverages. (Please do be kind to the maintainers. Harassing
or flaming them is likely to have the opposite effect of the
one you want.)</p>

<p>Feel free to update the ticket about your bug on
http://rt.perl.org if a new version of Perl is released and
your bug is still present.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a Address to send the report to. Defaults to
perlbug@perl.org.</p>

<p>-A Don t send a bug received acknowledgement to the
reply address. Generally it is only a sensible to use this
option if you are a perl maintainer actively watching perl
porters for your message to arrive.</p>

<p>-b Body of the report. If not included on the command
line, or in a file with -f, you will get a chance to edit
the message.</p>

<p>-C Dont send copy to administrator.</p>

<p>-c Address to send copy of report to. Defaults to the
address of the local perl administrator (recorded when perl
was built).</p>

<p>-d Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe
output). This prints out your configuration data, without
mailing anything. You can use this with -v to get more
complete data.</p>

<p>-e Editor to use.</p>

<p>-f File containing the body of the report. Use this to
quickly send a prepared message.</p>

<p>-F File to output the results to instead of sending as
an email. Useful particularly when running perlbug on a
machine with no direct internet connection.</p>

<p>-h Prints a brief summary of the options.</p>

<p>-ok Report successful build on this system to perl
porters. Forces -S and -C. Forces and supplies values for -s
and -b. Only prompts for a return address if it cannot guess
it (for use with make). Honors return address specified with
-r. You can use this with -v to get more complete data. Only
makes a report if this system is less than 60 days old.</p>

<p>-okay As -ok except it will report on older systems.</p>

<p>-nok Report unsuccessful build on this system. Forces
-C. Forces and supplies a value for -s, then requires you to
edit the report and say what went wrong. Alternatively, a
prepared report may be supplied using -f. Only prompts for a
return address if it cannot guess it (for use with make).
Honors return address specified with -r. You can use this
with -v to get more complete data. Only makes a report if
this system is less than 60 days old.</p>

<p>-nokay As -nok except it will report on older
systems.</p>

<p>-r Your return address. The program will ask you to
confirm its default if you dont use this option.</p>

<p>-S Send without asking for confirmation.</p>

<p>-s Subject to include with the message. You will be
prompted if you dont supply one on the command line.</p>

<p>-t Test mode. The target address defaults to
perlbug-test@perl.org.</p>

<p>-T Send a thank-you note instead of a bug report.</p>

<p>-v Include verbose configuration data in the report.</p>
