<p>NAMED-CHECKZONE(8) BIND9 NAMED-CHECKZONE(8)</p>

<p>NAME named-checkzone, named-compilezone - zone file
validity checking or converting tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS named-checkzone [-d] [-h] [-j] [-q] [-v] [-c
class] [-f format] [-F format] [-i mode] [-k mode] [-m mode]
[-M mode] [-n mode] [-o filename] [-r mode] [-s style] [-S
mode] [-t directory] [-w directory] [-D] [-W mode]
{zonename} {filename}</p>

<p>named-compilezone [-d] [-j] [-q] [-v] [-c class] [-C
mode] [-f format] [-F format] [-i mode] [-k mode] [-m mode]
[-n mode] [-r mode] [-s style] [-t directory] [-w directory]
[-D] [-W mode] {-o filename} {zonename} {filename}</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION named-checkzone checks the syntax and
integrity of a zone file. It performs the same checks as
named does when loading a zone. This makes named-checkzone
useful for checking zone files before configuring them into
a name server.</p>

<p>named-compilezone is similar to named-checkzone, but it
always dumps the zone contents to a specified file in a
specified format. Additionally, it applies stricter check
levels by default, since the dump output will be used as an
actual zone file loaded by named. When manually specified
otherwise, the check levels must at least be as strict as
those specified in the named configuration file.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d Enable debugging.</p>

<p>-h Print the usage summary and exit.</p>

<p>-q Quiet mode - exit code only.</p>

<p>-v Print the version of the named-checkzone program and
exit.</p>

<p>-j When loading the zone file read the journal if it
exists.</p>

<p>-c class Specify the class of the zone. If not
specified, &quot;IN&quot; is assumed.</p>

<p>-i mode Perform post-load zone integrity checks.
Possible modes are &quot;full&quot; (default),
&quot;full-sibling&quot;, &quot;local&quot;,
&quot;local-sibling&quot; and &quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p>Mode &quot;full&quot; checks that MX records refer to A
or AAAA record (both in-zone and out-of-zone hostnames).
Mode &quot;local&quot; only checks MX records which refer to
in-zone hostnames.</p>

<p>Mode &quot;full&quot; checks that SRV records refer to A
or AAAA record (both in-zone and out-of-zone hostnames).
Mode &quot;local&quot; only checks SRV records which refer
to in-zone hostnames.</p>

<p>Mode &quot;full&quot; checks that delegation NS records
refer to A or AAAA record (both in-zone and out-of-zone
hostnames). It also checks that glue address records in the
zone match those advertised by the child. Mode
&quot;local&quot; only checks NS records which refer to
in-zone hostnames or that some required glue exists, that is
when the nameserver is in a child zone.</p>

<p>Mode &quot;full-sibling&quot; and
&quot;local-sibling&quot; disable sibling glue checks but
are otherwise the same as &quot;full&quot; and
&quot;local&quot; respectively.</p>

<p>Mode &quot;none&quot; disables the checks.</p>

<p>-f format Specify the format of the zone file. Possible
formats are &quot;text&quot; (default) and
&quot;raw&quot;.</p>

<p>-F format Specify the format of the output file
specified. Possible formats are &quot;text&quot; (default)
and &quot;raw&quot;. For named-checkzone, this does not
cause any effects unless it dumps the zone contents.</p>

<p>-k mode Perform &quot;check-names&quot; checks with the
specified failure mode. Possible modes are &quot;fail&quot;
(default for named-compilezone), &quot;warn&quot; (default
for named-checkzone) and &quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p>-m mode Specify whether MX records should be checked to
see if they are addresses. Possible modes are
&quot;fail&quot;, &quot;warn&quot; (default) and
&quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p>-M mode Check if a MX record refers to a CNAME. Possible
modes are &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;warn&quot; (default) and
&quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p>-n mode Specify whether NS records should be checked to
see if they are addresses. Possible modes are
&quot;fail&quot; (default for named-compilezone),
&quot;warn&quot; (default for named-checkzone) and
&quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p>-o filename Write zone output to filename. If filename
is - then write to standard out. This is mandatory for
named-compilezone.</p>

<p>-r mode Check for records that are treated as different
by DNSSEC but are semantically equal in plain DNS. Possible
modes are &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;warn&quot; (default) and
&quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p>-s style Specify the style of the dumped zone file.
Possible styles are &quot;full&quot; (default) and
&quot;relative&quot;. The full format is most suitable for
processing automatically by a separate script. On the other
hand, the relative format is more human-readable and is thus
suitable for editing by hand. For named-checkzone this does
not cause any effects unless it dumps the zone contents. It
also does not have any meaning if the output format is not
text.</p>

<p>-S mode Check if a SRV record refers to a CNAME.
Possible modes are &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;warn&quot;
(default) and &quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p>-t directory Chroot to directory so that include
directives in the configuration file are processed as if run
by a similarly chrooted named.</p>

<p>-w directory chdir to directory so that relative
filenames in master file $INCLUDE directives work. This is
similar to the directory clause in named.conf.</p>

<p>-D Dump zone file in canonical format. This is always
enabled for named-compilezone.</p>

<p>-W mode Specify whether to check for non-terminal
wildcards. Non-terminal wildcards are almost always the
result of a failure to understand the wildcard matching
algorithm (RFC 1034). Possible modes are &quot;warn&quot;
(default) and &quot;ignore&quot;.</p>

<p>zonename The domain name of the zone being checked.</p>

<p>filename The name of the zone file.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUES named-checkzone returns an exit status of
1 if errors were detected and 0 otherwise.</p>
