<p>XGETDEVICEKEYMAPPING(3) XGETDEVICEKEYMAPPING(3)</p>

<p>NAME XGetDeviceKeyMapping, XChangeDeviceKeyMapping -
query or change device key mappings</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;</p>

<p>KeySym *XGetDeviceKeyMapping( Display *display, XDevice
*device, KeyCode first_keycode, int keycode_count, int
*keysyms_per_keycode_return); display Specifies the
connection to the X server.</p>

<p>device Specifies the device whose key mapping is to be
queried or modified.</p>

<p>first_keycode Specifies the first KeyCode to be
returned.</p>

<p>keycode_count Specifies the number of KeyCodes to be
returned or modified.</p>

<p>keysyms_per_keycode Specifies the number of KeySyms per
KeyCode.</p>

<p>keysyms_per_keycode_return Specifies the address of a
variable into which the number of KeySyms per KeyCodewill be
returned.</p>

<p>keysyms Specifies the address of an array of
KeySyms.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION For the specified device, the
XGetDeviceKeyMapping request returns the symbols for the
specified number of KeyCodes starting with first_keycode.
The value specified in first_keycode must be greater than or
equal to min_keycode as returned by XListInputDevices, or a
BadValue error results. In addition, the following
expression must be less than or equal to max_keycode as
returned by XListInputDevices:</p>

<p>first_keycode + keycode_count - 1</p>

<p>If this is not the case, a BadValue error results. The
number of elements in the KeySyms list is:</p>

<p>keycode_count * keysyms_per_keycode_return</p>

<p>KeySym number N, counting from zero, for KeyCode K has
the following index in the list, counting from zero: (K -
first_code) * keysyms_per_code_return + N</p>

<p>The X server arbitrarily chooses the
keysyms_per_keycode_return value to be large enough to
report all requested symbols. A special KeySym value of
NoSymbol is used to fill in unused elements for individual
KeyCodes. To free the storage returned by
XGetDeviceKeyMapping, use XFree.</p>

<p>If the specified device does not support input class
keys, a BadMatch error will result.</p>

<p>XGetDeviceKeyMapping can generate a BadDevice, BadMatch,
or BadValue error.</p>

<p>For the specified device, the XChangeDeviceKeyMapping
request defines the symbols for the specified number of
KeyCodes starting with first_keycode. The symbols for
KeyCodes outside this range remain unchanged. The number of
elements in keysyms must be:</p>

<p>num_codes * keysyms_per_keycode</p>

<p>The specified first_keycode must be greater than or
equal to min_keycode returned by XListInputDevices, or a
BadValue error results. In addition, the following
expression must be less than or equal to max_keycode as
returned by XListInputDevices, or a BadValue error
results:</p>

<p>first_keycode + num_codes - 1</p>

<p>KeySym number N, counting from zero, for KeyCode K has
the following index in keysyms, counting from zero:</p>

<p>(K - first_keycode) * keysyms_per_keycode + N</p>

<p>The specified keysyms_per_keycode can be chosen
arbitrarily by the client to be large enough to hold all
desired symbols. A special KeySym value of NoSymbol should
be used to fill in unused elements for individual KeyCodes.
It is legal for NoSymbol to appear in nontrailing positions
of the effective list for a KeyCode.XChangeDeviceKeyMapping
generates a DeviceMappingNotify event that is sent to all
clients that have selected that type of event.</p>

<p>There is no requirement that the X server interpret this
mapping. It is merely stored for reading and writing by
clients.</p>

<p>If the specified device does not support input class
keys, a BadMatch error results.</p>

<p>XChangeDeviceKeyMapping can generate a BadDevice,
BadMatch, BadAlloc, or BadValue error.</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS BadDevice An invalid device was specified.
The specified device does not exist or has not been opened
by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error may also
occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer
device.</p>

<p>BadMatch This error may occur if an XGetDeviceKeyMapping
or XChangeDeviceKeyMapping request was made specifying a
device that has no keys.</p>

<p>BadValue Some numeric value falls outside the range of
values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
argument&rsquo;s type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
set of alternatives can generate this error.</p>

<p>BadAlloc The server failed to allocate the requested
resource or server memory.</p>
