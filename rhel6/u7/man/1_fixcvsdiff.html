<p>NAME fixcvsdiff - fix problematic diff files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fixcvsdiff [-p] [-b] [file...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fixcvsdiff modifies diff files created from
the cvs diff command, where files have been added or
removed. CVS tends to create diff files that patch(1)
mis-interprets. The diff file must retain the lines
beginning with Index: in order for the correction to
work.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -b Keep a .bak backup file.</p>

<p>-p Print out the cvs add and cvs remove commands that
must be made after applying the diff, but before running cvs
commit.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO diff(1), patch(1), cvs(1)</p>
