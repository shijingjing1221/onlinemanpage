<p>NAME Tk_CanvasPsY, Tk_CanvasPsBitmap, Tk_CanvasPsColor,
Tk_CanvasPsFont, Tk_CanvasPsPath, Tk_CanvasPsStipple -
utility procedures for generating Postscript for
canvases</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;tk.h&gt;</p>

<p>double Tk_CanvasPsY(canvas, canvasY)</p>

<p>int Tk_CanvasPsBitmap(interp, canvas, bitmap, x, y,
width, height)</p>

<p>int Tk_CanvasPsColor(interp, canvas, colorPtr)</p>

<p>int Tk_CanvasPsFont(interp, canvas, tkFont)</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasPsPath(interp, canvas, coordPtr, numPoints)</p>

<p>int Tk_CanvasPsStipple(interp, canvas, bitmap)</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS Tk_Canvas canvas (in) A token that identifies
a canvas widget for which Postscript is being generated.</p>

<p>double canvasY (in) Y-coordinate in the space of the
canvas.</p>

<p>Tcl_Interp *interp (in/out) A Tcl interpreter;
Postscript is appended to its result, or the result may be
replaced with an error message.</p>

<p>Pixmap bitmap (in) Bitmap to use for generating
Postscript.</p>

<p>int x (in) X-coordinate within bitmap of left edge of
region to output.</p>

<p>int y (in) Y-coordinate within bitmap of top edge of
region to output.</p>

<p>int width (in) Width of region of bitmap to out- put, in
pixels.</p>

<p>int height (in) Height of region of bitmap to out- put,
in pixels.</p>

<p>XColor *colorPtr (in) Information about color value to
set in Postscript.</p>

<p>Tk_Font tkFont (in) Font for which Postscript is to be
generated.</p>

<p>double *coordPtr (in) Pointer to an array of coordinates
for one or more points specified in canvas coordinates. The
order of values in coordPtr is x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, and
so on.</p>

<p>int numPoints (in) Number of points at coordPtr.

<p>DESCRIPTION These procedures are called by canvas type
managers to carry out common functions related to generating
Postscript. Most of the procedures take a canvas argument,
which refers to a canvas widget for which Postscript is
being generated.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasPsY takes as argument a y-coordinate in the
space of a canvas and returns the value that should be used
for that point in the Postscript currently being generated
for canvas. Y coordinates require transformation because
Postscript uses an origin at the lower-left cor- ner whereas
X uses an origin at the upper-left corner. Canvas x coor-
dinates can be used directly in Postscript without
transformation.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasPsBitmap generates Postscript to describe a
region of a bitmap. The Postscript is generated in proper
image data format for Postscript, i.e., as data between
angle brackets, one bit per pixel. The Postscript is
appended to interp-&gt;result and TCL_OK is returned unless
an error occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is returned and
interp-&gt;result is overwritten with an error message.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasPsColor generates Postscript to set the current
color to cor- respond to its colorPtr argument, taking into
account any color map specified in the postscript command.
It appends the Postscript to interp-&gt;result and returns
TCL_OK unless an error occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is
returned and interp-&gt;result is overwritten with an error
message.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasPsFont generates Postscript that sets the
current font to match tkFont as closely as possible.
Tk_CanvasPsFont takes into account any font map specified in
the postscript command, and it does the best it can at
mapping X fonts to Postscript fonts. It appends the
Postscript to interp-&gt;result and returns TCL_OK unless an
error occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is returned and
interp-&gt;result is overwritten with an error message.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasPsPath generates Postscript to set the current
path to the set of points given by coordPtr and numPoints.
It appends the resulting Postscript to
interp-&gt;result.</p>

<p>Tk_CanvasPsStipple generates Postscript that will fill
the current path in stippled fashion. It uses bitmap as the
stipple pattern and the current Postscript color; ones in
the stipple bitmap are drawn in the current color, and
zeroes are not drawn at all. The Postscript is appended to
interp-&gt;result and TCL_OK is returned, unless an error
occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is returned and
interp-&gt;result is over- written with an error
message.</p>
