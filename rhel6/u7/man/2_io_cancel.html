<p>IO_CANCEL(2) Linux Programmer s Manual IO_CANCEL(2)</p>

<p>NAME io_cancel - cancel an outstanding asynchronous I/O
operation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;libaio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int io_cancel(aio_context_t ctx_id, struct iocb *iocb,
struct io_event *result);</p>

<p>Link with -laio.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION io_cancel() attempts to cancel an
asynchronous I/O operation previously submitted with
io_submit(2). ctx_id is the AIO context ID of the oper-
ation to be canceled. If the AIO context is found, the event
will be canceled and then copied into the memory pointed to
by result without being placed into the completion
queue.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE On success, io_cancel() returns 0. For the
failure return, see NOTES.</p>

<p>ERRORS EAGAIN The iocb specified was not canceled.</p>

<p>EFAULT One of the data structures points to invalid
data.</p>

<p>EINVAL The AIO context specified by ctx_id is
invalid.</p>

<p>ENOSYS io_cancel() is not implemented on this
architecture.</p>

<p>VERSIONS The asynchronous I/O system calls first
appeared in Linux 2.5, August 2002.</p>

<p>CONFORMING TO io_cancel() is Linux-specific and should
not be used in programs that are intended to be
portable.</p>

<p>NOTES Glibc does not provide a wrapper function for this
system call.</p>

<p>The wrapper provided in libaio for io_cancel() does not
follow the usual C library conventions for indicating error:
on error it returns a negated error number (the negative of
one of the values listed in ERRORS). If the system call is
invoked via syscall(2), then the return value follows the
usual conventions for indicating an error: -1, with errno
set to a (positive) value that indicates the error.</p>
