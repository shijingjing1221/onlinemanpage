<p>GROFF(1) GROFF(1)</p>

<p>NAME groff - front-end for the groff document formatting
system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS groff [-abcegilpstzCEGNRSUVXZ] [-d cs] [-f fam]
[-F dir] [-I dir] [-L arg] [-m name] [-M dir] [-n num] [-o
list] [-P arg] [-r cn] [-T dev] [-w name] [-W name] [file
...] groff -h | --help groff -v | --version [option ...]</p>

<p>The command line is parsed according to the usual GNU
convention. The whitespace between a command line option and
its argument is optional. Options can be grouped behind a
single - (minus character). A filename of - (minus
character) denotes the standard input.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This document describes the groff program,
the main front-end for the groff document formatting system.
The groff program and macro suite is the implementation of a
roff(7) system within the free software collec- tion GNU
http://www.gnu.org. The groff system has all features of the
classical roff, but adds many extensions.</p>

<p>The groff program allows to control the whole groff
system by command line options. This is a great
simplification in comparison to the classical case (which
uses pipes only).</p>

<p>OPTIONS As groff is a wrapper program for troff both
programs share a set of options. But the groff program has
some additional, native options and gives a new meaning to
some troff options. On the other hand, not all troff options
can be fed into groff.</p>

<p>Native groff Options The following options either do not
exist for troff or are differently interpreted by groff.</p>

<p>-e Preprocess with eqn.</p>

<p>-g Preprocess with grn.</p>

<p>-G Preprocess with grap.</p>

<p>-h --help Print a help message.</p>

<p>-I dir Add search directory for soelim(1). This option
implies the -s option.</p>

<p>-l Send the output to a spooler program for printing.
The command that should be used for this is specified by the
print command in the device description file, see
groff_font(5). If this com- mand is not present, the output
is piped into the lpr(1) program by default. See options -L
and -X.</p>

<p>-L arg Pass arg to the spooler program. Several
arguments should be passed with a separate -L option each.
Note that groff does not prepend - (a minus sign) to arg
before passing it to the spooler program.</p>

<p>-N Dont allow newlines within eqn delimiters. This is
the same as the -N option in eqn.</p>

<p>-p Preprocess with pic.</p>

<p>-P -option -P -option -P arg Pass -option or -option arg
to the postprocessor. The option must be specified with the
necessary preceding minus sign(s) - or -- because groff does
not prepend any dashes before passing it to the
postprocessor. For example, to pass a title to the gxditview
postprocessor, the shell command</p>

<p>sh# groff -X -P -title -P groff it foo</p>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<p>sh# groff -X -Z foo | gxditview -title groff it -</p>

<p>-R Preprocess with refer. No mechanism is provided for
passing ar- guments to refer because most refer options have
equivalent lan- guage elements that can be specified within
the document. See refer(1) for more details.</p>

<p>-s Preprocess with soelim.</p>

<p>-S Safer mode. Pass the -S option to pic and disable the
following troff requests: .open, .opena, .pso, .sy, and .pi.
For security reasons, safer mode is enabled by default.</p>

<p>-t Preprocess with tbl.</p>

<p>-T dev Set output device to dev. The possible values in
groff are ascii, cp1047, dvi, html, latin1, lbp, lj4, ps,
utf8, X75, and X100. Additionally, X75-12 and X100-12 are
available for docu- ments which use 12pt as the base
document size. The default de- vice is ps.</p>

<p>-U Unsafe mode. Reverts to the (old) unsafe behaviour;
see option -S.</p>

<p>-v --version Output version information of groff and of
all programs that are run by it; that is, the given command
line is parsed in the usu- al way, passing -v to all
subprograms.</p>

<p>-V Output the pipeline that would be run by groff (as a
wrapper program), but do not execute it.</p>

<p>-X Use gxditview instead of using the usual
postprocessor to (pre)view a document. The printing spooler
behavior as outlined with options -l and -L is carried over
to gxditview(1) by deter- mining an argument for the
-printCommand option of gxditview(1). This sets the default
Print action and the corresponding menu entry to that value.
-X only produces good results with -Tps, -TX75, -TX75-12,
-TX100, and -TX100-12. The default resolution for previewing
-Tps output is 75dpi; this can be changed by passing the
-resolution option to gxditview, for example</p>

<p>sh# groff -X -P-resolution -P100 -man foo.1</p>

<p>-z Suppress output generated by troff. Only error
messages will be printed.</p>

<p>-Z Do not postprocess the output of troff that is
normally called automatically by groff. This will print the
intermediate output to standard output; see
groff_out(5).</p>

<p>Transparent Options The following options are
transparently handed over to the formatter program troff
that is called by groff subsequently. These options are
described in more detail in troff(1).</p>

<p>-a ascii approximation of output.</p>

<p>-b backtrace on error or warning.</p>

<p>-c disable color output.</p>

<p>-C enable compatibility mode.</p>

<p>-d cs -d name=s define string.</p>

<p>-E disable troff error messages.</p>

<p>-f fam set default font family.</p>

<p>-F dir set path for font DESC files.</p>

<p>-i process standard input after the specified input
files.</p>

<p>-m name include macro file name.tmac (or tmac.name); see
also groff_tmac(5).</p>

<p>-M dir path for macro files.</p>

<p>-n num number the first page num.</p>

<p>-o list output only pages in list.</p>

<p>-r cn -r name=n set number register.</p>

<p>-w name enable warning name.</p>

<p>-W name disable warning name.</p>

<p>USING GROFF The groff system implements the
infrastructure of classical roff; see roff(7) for a survey
on how a roff system works in general. Due to the front-end
programs available within the groff system, using groff is
much easier than classical roff. This section gives an
overview of the parts that constitute the groff system. It
complements roff(7) with groff-specific features. This
section can be regarded as a guide to the documentation
around the groff system.</p>

<p>Front-ends The groff program is a wrapper around the
troff(1) program. It allows to specify the preprocessors by
command line options and automatically runs the
postprocessor that is appropriate for the selected device.
Doing so, the sometimes tedious piping mechanism of
classical roff(7) can be avoided.</p>

<p>The grog(1) program can be used for guessing the correct
groff command line to format a file.</p>

<p>The groffer(1) program is an allround-viewer for groff
files and man pages.</p>

<p>Preprocessors The groff preprocessors are
reimplementations of the classical prepro- cessors with
moderate extensions. The preprocessors distributed with the
groff package are</p>

<p>eqn(1) for mathematical formul&aelig;,</p>

<p>grn(1) for including gremlin(1) pictures,</p>

<p>pic(1) for drawing diagrams,</p>

<p>refer(1) for bibliographic references,</p>

<p>soelim(1) for including macro files from standard
locations,</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>tbl(1) for tables.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are some internal preprocessors
that are automati- cally run with some devices. These arent
visible to the user.</p>

<p>Macro Packages Macro packages can be included by option
-m. The groff system imple- ments and extends all classical
macro packages in a compatible way and adds some packages of
its own. Actually, the following macro packages come with
groff:</p>

<p>man The traditional man page format; see groff_man(7).
It can be specified on the command line as -man or -m
man.</p>

<p>mandoc The general package for man pages; it
automatically recognizes whether the documents uses the man
or the mdoc format and branches to the corresponding macro
package. It can be speci- fied on the command line as
-mandoc or -m mandoc.</p>

<p>mdoc The BSD-style man page format; see groff_mdoc(7).
It can be specified on the command line as -mdoc or -m
mdoc.</p>

<p>me The classical me document format; see groff_me(7). It
can be specified on the command line as -me or -m me.</p>

<p>mm The classical mm document format; see groff_mm(7). It
can be specified on the command line as -mm or -m mm.</p>

<p>ms The classical ms document format; see groff_ms(7). It
can be specified on the command line as -ms or -m ms.</p>

<p>www HTML-like macros for inclusion in arbitrary groff
documents; see groff_www(7).</p>

<p>Details on the naming of macro files and their placement
can be found in groff_tmac(5).</p>

<p>Programming Language General concepts common to all roff
programming languages are described in roff(7).</p>

<p>The groff extensions to the classical troff language are
documented in groff_diff(7).</p>

<p>The groff language as a whole is described in the (still
incomplete) groff info file; a short (but complete)
reference can be found in groff(7).</p>

<p>Formatters The central roff formatter within the groff
system is troff(1). It provides the features of both the
classical troff and nroff, as well as the groff extensions.
The command line option -C switches troff into compatibility
mode which tries to emulate classical roff as much as
possible.</p>

<p>There is a shell script nroff(1) that emulates the
behavior of classi- cal nroff. It tries to automatically
select the proper output encod- ing, according to the
current locale.</p>

<p>The formatter program generates intermediate output; see
groff_out(7).</p>

<p>Devices In roff, the output targets are called devices.
A device can be a piece of hardware, e.g. a printer, or a
software file format. A device is specified by the option
-T. The groff devices are as follows.</p>

<p>ascii Text output using the ascii(7) character set.</p>

<p>cp1047 Text output using the EBCDIC code page IBM cp1047
(e.g. OS/390 Unix).</p>

<p>nippon Text output using the Japanese-EUC character
set.</p>

<p>dvi TeX DVI format.</p>

<p>html HTML output.</p>

<p>ascii8 For typewriter-like devices. Unlike ascii, this
device is 8 bit clean. This device is intended to be used
for codesets other than ASCII and ISO-8859-1.</p>

<p>latin1 Text output using the ISO Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1)
character set; see iso_8859_1(7).</p>

<p>lbp Output for Canon CAPSL printers (LBP-4 and LBP-8
series laser printers).</p>

<p>lj4 HP LaserJet4-compatible (or other PCL5-compatible)
printers.</p>

<p>ps PostScript output; suitable for printers and
previewers like gv(1).</p>

<p>utf8 Text output using the Unicode (ISO 10646) character
set with UTF-8 encoding; see unicode(7).</p>

<p>X75 75dpi X Window System output suitable for the
previewers xditview(1x) and gxditview(1). A variant for a
12pt document base font is X75-12.</p>

<p>X100 100dpi X Window System output suitable for the
previewers xditview(1x) and gxditview(1). A variant for a
12pt document base font is X100-12.</p>

<p>The postprocessor to be used for a device is specified
by the postpro command in the device description file; see
groff_font(5). This can be overridden with the -X
option.</p>

<p>The default device is ps.</p>

<p>Postprocessors groff provides 3 hardware
postprocessors:</p>

<p>grolbp(1) for some Canon printers,</p>

<p>grolj4(1) for printers compatible to the HP LaserJet 4
and PCL5,</p>

<p>grotty(1) for text output using various encodings, e.g.
on text-oriented terminals or line-printers.</p>

<p>Today, most printing or drawing hardware is handled by
the operating system, by device drivers, or by software
interfaces, usually accepting PostScript. Consequently,
there isnt an urgent need for more hardware device
postprocessors.</p>

<p>The groff software devices for conversion into other
document file for- mats are</p>

<p>grodvi(1) for the DVI format,</p>

<p>grohtml(1) for HTML format,</p>

<p>grops(1) for PostScript.</p>

<p>Combined with the many existing free conversion tools
this should be sufficient to convert a troff document into
virtually any existing data format.</p>

<p>Utilities The following utility programs around groff
are available.</p>

<p>addftinfo(1) Add information to troff font description
files for use with groff.</p>

<p>afmtodit(1) Create font description files for PostScript
device.</p>

<p>groffer(1) General viewer program for groff files and
man pages.</p>

<p>gxditview(1) The groff X viewer, the GNU version of
xditview.</p>

<p>hpftodit(1) Create font description files for lj4
device.</p>

<p>indxbib(1) Make inverted index for bibliographic
databases.</p>

<p>lkbib(1) Search bibliographic databases.</p>

<p>lookbib(1) Interactively search bibliographic
databases.</p>

<p>pfbtops(1) Translate a PostScript font in .pfb format to
ASCII.</p>

<p>tfmtodit(1) Create font description files for TeX DVI
device.</p>

<p>xditview(1x) roff viewer distributed with X window.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Normally, the path separator in the
following environment variables is the colon; this may vary
depending on the operating system. For exam- ple, DOS and
Windows use a semicolon instead.</p>

<p>GROFF_BIN_PATH This search path, followed by $PATH, will
be used for commands that are executed by groff. If it is
not set then the directory where the groff binaries were
installed is prepended to PATH.</p>

<p>GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX When there is a need to run
different roff implementations at the same time groff
provides the facility to prepend a prefix to most of its
programs that could provoke name clashings at run time
(default is to have none). Historically, this prefix was the
character g, but it can be anything. For example, gtroff
stood for groffs troff, gtbl for the groff version of tbl.
By setting GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX to different values, the
different roff installations can be addressed. More exactly,
if it is set to prefix xxx then groff as a wrapper program
will internally call xxxtroff instead of troff. This also
applies to the pre- processors eqn, grn, pic, refer, tbl,
soelim, and to the utili- ties indxbib and lookbib. This
feature does not apply to any programs different from the
ones above (most notably groff it- self) since they are
unique to the groff package.</p>

<p>GROFF_FONT_PATH A list of directories in which to search
for the devname direc- tory in addition to the default ones.
See troff(1) and groff_font(5) for more details.</p>

<p>GROFF_TMAC_PATH A list of directories in which to search
for macro files in ad- dition to the default directories.
See troff(1) and groff_tmac(5) for more details.</p>

<p>GROFF_TMPDIR The directory in which temporary files will
be created. If this is not set but the environment variable
TMPDIR instead, tempo- rary files will be created in the
directory $TMPDIR. Otherwise temporary files will be created
in /tmp. The refer(1), groffer(1), grohtml(1), and grops(1)
commands use temporary files.</p>

<p>GROFF_TYPESETTER Preset the default device. If this is
not set the ps device is used as default. This device name
is overwritten by the option -T.</p>

<p>FILES There are some directories in which groff installs
all of its data files. Due to different installation habits
on different operating systems, their locations are not
absolutely fixed, but their function is clearly defined and
coincides on all systems.</p>

<p>groff Macro Directory This contains all information
related to macro packages. Note that more than a single
directory is searched for those files as documented in
groff_tmac(5). For the groff installation corresponding to
this document, it is located at
/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/tmac. The follow- ing files
contained in the groff macro directory have a special mean-
ing:</p>

<p>troffrc Initialization file for troff. This is
interpreted by troff be- fore reading the macro sets and any
input.</p>

<p>troffrc-end Final startup file for troff, it is parsed
after all macro sets have been read.</p>

<p>name.tmac tmac.name Macro file for macro package
name.</p>

<p>groff Font Directory This contains all information
related to output devices. Note that more than a single
directory is searched for those files; see troff(1). For the
groff installation corresponding to this document, it is
locat- ed at /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.4/font. The following
files contained in the groff font directory have a special
meaning:</p>

<p>devname/DESC Device description file for device name,
see groff_font(5).</p>

<p>devname/F Font file for font F of device name.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example illustrates the power of
the groff program as a wrapper around troff.</p>

<p>To process a roff file using the preprocessors tbl and
pic and the me macro set, classical troff had to be called
by</p>

<p>sh# pic foo.me | tbl | troff -me -Tlatin1 | grotty</p>

<p>Using groff, this pipe can be shortened to the
equivalent command</p>

<p>sh# groff -p -t -me -T latin1 foo.me</p>

<p>An even easier way to call this is to use grog(1) to
guess the prepro- cessor and macro options and execute the
generated command (by specify- ing shell left quotes)</p>

<p>sh# grog -Tlatin1 foo.me</p>

<p>The simplest way is to view the contents in an automated
way by calling</p>

<p>sh# groffer foo.me</p>

<p>BUGS On EBCDIC hosts (e.g. OS/390 Unix), output devices
ascii and latin1 arent available. Similarly, output for
EBCDIC code page cp1047 is not available on ASCII based
operating systems.</p>

<p>Report bugs to bug-groff@gnu.org. Include a complete,
self-contained example that will allow the bug to be
reproduced, and say which version of groff you are
using.</p>
