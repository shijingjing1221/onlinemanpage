<p>NAME lshw - list hardware</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS lshw [ -version ]</p>

<p>lshw [ -help ]</p>

<p>lshw [ -X ]</p>

<p>lshw [ [ -html ] [ -short ] [ -xml ] [ -json ] [
-businfo ] ] [ -dump filename ] [ -class class... ] [
-disable test... ] [ -enable test... ] [ -sanitize ] [
-numeric ] [ -quiet ]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION lshw is a small tool to extract detailed
information on the hardware configuration of the machine. It
can report exact memory configuration, firmware version,
mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, cache
configuration, bus speed, etc. on DMI-capable x86 or IA-64
systems and on some PowerPC machines (PowerMac G4 is known
to work).</p>

<p>It currently supports DMI (x86 and IA-64 only),
OpenFirmware device tree (PowerPC only), PCI/AGP, CPUID
(x86), IDE/ATA/ATAPI, PCMCIA (only tested on x86), SCSI and
USB.</p>

<p>-version Displays the version of lshw and exits.</p>

<p>-help Displays the available command line options and
quits.</p>

<p>-X Launch the X11 GUI (if available).</p>

<p>-html Outputs the device tree as an HTML page.</p>

<p>-xml Outputs the device tree as an XML tree.</p>

<p>-json Outputs the device tree as a JSON object
(JavaScript Object Notation).</p>

<p>-short Outputs the device tree showing hardware paths,
very much like the output of HP-UXs ioscan.</p>

<p>-businfo Outputs the device list showing bus
information, detailing SCSI, USB, IDE and PCI addresses.</p>

<p>-dump filename Dump collected information into a file
(SQLite database).</p>

<p>-class class Only show the given class of hardware.
class can be found using lshw -short or lshw -businfo.</p>

<p>-C class Alias for -class class.</p>

<p>-enable test</p>

<p>-disable test Enables or disables a test. test can be
dmi (for DMI/SMBIOS extensions), device-tree (for
OpenFirmware device tree), spd (for memory Serial Presence
Detect), memory (for memory-size guessing heuristics),
cpuinfo (for kernel-reported CPU detec- tion), cpuid (for
CPU detection), pci (for PCI/AGP access), isapnp (for ISA
PnP extensions), pcmcia (for PCMCIA/PCCARD), ide (for
IDE/ATAPI), usb (for USB devices),scsi (for SCSI) or net-
work (for network interfaces detection).</p>

<p>-quiet Dont display status.</p>

<p>-sanitize Remove potentially sensitive information from
output (IP addresses, serial numbers, etc.).</p>

<p>-numeric Also display numeric IDs (for PCI and USB
devices).</p>

<p>BUGS lshw currently does not detect Firewire(IEEE1394)
devices.</p>

<p>Not all architectures supported by GNU/Linux are fully
supported (e.g. CPU detection).</p>

<p>&quot;Virtual&quot; SCSI interfaces used for SCSI
emulation over IDE are not reported correctly yet.</p>

<p>NOTES lshw must be run as super user or it will only
report partial informa- tion.</p>

<p>FILES /usr/local/share/pci.ids</p>

<p>/usr/share/pci.ids</p>

<p>/etc/pci.ids</p>

<p>/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids A list of all known PCI IDs
(vendors, devices, classes and sub- classes).</p>

<p>/proc/bus/pci/* Used to access the configuration of
installed PCI busses and devices.</p>

<p>/proc/ide/* Used to access the configuration of
installed IDE busses and devices.</p>

<p>/proc/scsi/*, /dev/sg* Used to access the configuration
of installed SCSI devices.</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/*/cpuid Used on x86 platforms to access
CPU-specific configuration.</p>

<p>/proc/device-tree/* Used on PowerPC platforms to access
OpenFirmware configuration.</p>

<p>/proc/bus/usb/* Used to access the configuration of
installed USB busses and devices.</p>

<p>/sys/* Used on 2.6 kernels to access hardware/driver
configuration information.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES lshw -short Lists hardware in a compact
format.</p>

<p>lshw -class disk -class storage Lists all disks and
storage controllers in the system.</p>

<p>lshw -html -class network Lists all network interfaces
in HTML.</p>

<p>lshw -disable dmi Dont use DMI to detect hardware.</p>
