<p>NAME ftp - Internet file transfer program</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ftp [-pinegvd] [host] pftp [-inegvd] [host]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Ftp is the user interface to the Internet
standard File Transfer Proto- col. The program allows a user
to transfer files to and from a remote network site.</p>

<p>Options may be specified at the command line, or to the
command inter- preter.</p>

<p>-A Use active mode for data transfers. This is useful
for transmis- sions to servers which do not support passive
connections (for whatever reason.)</p>

<p>-p Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of
ftp in environ- ments where a firewall prevents connections
from the outside world back to the client machine. Requires
that the ftp server support the PASV command. This is the
default now for all clients (ftp and pftp) due to security
concerns using the PORT transfer mode. The flag is kept for
compatibility only and has no effect anymore.</p>

<p>-i Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file
transfers.</p>

<p>-n Restrains ftp from attempting auto-login upon initial
connection. If auto-login is enabled, ftp will check the
.netrc (see netrc(5)) file in the user s home directory for
an entry describing an account on the remote machine. If no
entry exists, ftp will prompt for the remote machine login
name (default is the user identity on the local machine),
and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with
which to login.</p>

<p>-e Disables command editing and history support, if it
was compiled into the ftp executable. Otherwise, does
nothing.</p>

<p>-g Disables file name globbing.</p>

<p>-m The default requires that ftp explicitly binds to the
same inter- face for the data channel as the control channel
in passive mode. Useful on multi-homed clients. This option
disables this behavior.</p>

<p>-v Verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from
the remote server, as well as report on data transfer
statistics.</p>

<p>-d Enables debugging.</p>

<p>The client host with which ftp is to communicate may be
specified on the command line. If this is done, ftp will
immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP
server on that host; otherwise, ftp will enter its command
interpreter and await instructions from the user. When ftp
is awaiting commands from the user the prompt ftp&gt; is
provided to the user. The following commands are recognized
by ftp:</p>

<p>! [command [args]] Invoke an interactive shell on the
local machine. If there are arguments, the first is taken to
be a command to execute directly, with the rest of the
arguments as its arguments.</p>

<p>$ macro-name [args] Execute the macro macro-name that
was defined with the macdef command. Arguments are passed to
the macro unglobbed.</p>

<p>account [passwd] Supply a supplemental password required
by a remote system for access to resources once a login has
been successfully completed. If no argument is included, the
user will be prompted for an account password in a
non-echoing input mode.</p>

<p>append local-file [remote-file] Append a local file to a
file on the remote machine. If remote-file is left
unspecified, the local file name is used in naming the
remote file after being altered by any ntrans or nmap
setting. File transfer uses the current settings for type,
format, mode, and structure.</p>

<p>ascii Set the file transfer type to network ASCII. This
is the default type.</p>

<p>bell Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file
transfer com- mand is completed.</p>

<p>binary Set the file transfer type to support binary
image transfer.</p>

<p>bye Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and
exit ftp. An end of file will also terminate the session and
exit.</p>

<p>case Toggle remote computer file name case mapping
during mget commands. When case is on (default is off),
remote computer file names with all letters in upper case
are written in the local directory with the letters mapped
to lower case.</p>

<p>cd remote-directory Change the working directory on the
remote machine to remote-directory.</p>

<p>cdup Change the remote machine working directory to the
parent of the current remote machine working directory.</p>

<p>chmod mode file-name Change the permission modes of the
file file-name on the remote sytem to mode.</p>

<p>close Terminate the FTP session with the remote server,
and return to the command interpreter. Any defined macros
are erased.</p>

<p>cr Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type
file retrieval. Records are denoted by a carriage
return/linefeed sequence during ascii type file transfer.
When cr is on (the default), carriage returns are stripped
from this sequence to conform with the UNIX single linefeed
record delimiter. Records on non-UNIX remote systems may
contain single line- feeds; when an ascii type transfer is
made, these linefeeds may be distinguished from a record
delimiter only when cr is off.</p>

<p>delete remote-file Delete the file remote-file on the
remote machine.</p>

<p>debug [debug-value] Toggle debugging mode. If an
optional debug-value is speci- fied it is used to set the
debugging level. When debugging is on, ftp prints each
command sent to the remote machine, preceded by the string
--&gt;</p>

<p>dir [remote-directory] [local-file] Print a listing of
the directory contents in the directory, remote-directory,
and, optionally, placing the output in local-file. If
interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to
verify that the last argument is indeed the tar- get local
file for receiving dir output. If no directory is specified,
the current working directory on the remote machine is used.
If no local file is specified, or local-file is -, output
comes to the terminal.</p>

<p>disconnect A synonym for close.</p>

<p>form format Set the file transfer form to format. The
default format is file.</p>

<p>get remote-file [local-file] Retrieve the remote-file
and store it on the local machine. If the local file name is
not specified, it is given the same name it has on the
remote machine, subject to alteration by the current case,
ntrans, and nmap settings. The current settings for type,
form, mode, and structure are used while transferring the
file.</p>

<p>glob Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and
mput. If globbing is turned off with glob, the file name
arguments are taken literally and not expanded. Globbing for
mput is done as in csh(1). For mdelete and mget, each remote
file name is expanded separately on the remote machine and
the lists are not merged. Expansion of a directory name is
likely to be different from expansion of the name of an
ordinary file: the exact result depends on the foreign
operating system and ftp server, and can be previewed by
doing mls remote-files - Note: mget and mput are not meant
to transfer entire direc- tory subtrees of files. That can
be done by transferring a tar(1) archive of the subtree (in
binary mode).</p>

<p>hash Toggle hash-sign ( #) printing for each data block
trans- ferred. The size of a data block is 1024 bytes.</p>

<p>help [command] Print an informative message about the
meaning of command. If no argument is given, ftp prints a
list of the known com- mands.</p>

<p>idle [seconds] Set the inactivity timer on the remote
server to seconds sec- onds. If seconds is ommitted, the
current inactivity timer is printed.</p>

<p>lcd [directory] Change the working directory on the
local machine. If no directory is specified, the users home
directory is used.</p>

<p>ls [remote-directory] [local-file] Print a listing of
the contents of a directory on the remote machine. The
listing includes any system-dependent informa- tion that the
server chooses to include; for example, most UNIX systems
will produce output from the command ls -l. (See also
nlist.) If remote-directory is left unspecified, the current
working directory is used. If interactive prompting is on,
ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is
indeed the target local file for receiving ls output. If no
local file is specified, or if local-file is -, the output
is sent to the terminal.</p>

<p>macdef macro-name Define a macro. Subsequent lines are
stored as the macro macro-name; a null line (consecutive
newline characters in a file or carriage returns from the
terminal) terminates macro input mode. There is a limit of
16 macros and 4096 total characters in all defined macros.
Macros remain defined until a close command is executed. The
macro processor interprets $ and as special characters. A $
followed by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the
corresponding argument on the macro invocation command line.
A $ fol- lowed by an i signals that macro processor that the
execut- ing macro is to be looped. On the first pass $i is
replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation com-
mand line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
argument, and so on. A followed by any character is replaced
by that character. Use the to prevent special treatment of
the $.</p>

<p>mdelete [remote-files] Delete the remote-files on the
remote machine.</p>

<p>mdir remote-files local-file Like dir, except multiple
remote files may be specified. If interactive prompting is
on, ftp will prompt the user to ver- ify that the last
argument is indeed the target local file for receiving mdir
output.</p>

<p>mget remote-files Expand the remote-files on the remote
machine and do a get for each file name thus produced. See
glob for details on the filename expansion. Resulting file
names will then be processed according to case, ntrans, and
nmap settings. Files are transferred into the local working
directory, which can be changed with lcd directory; new
local directories can be created with ! mkdir directory.</p>

<p>mkdir directory-name Make a directory on the remote
machine.</p>

<p>mls remote-files local-file Like nlist, except multiple
remote files may be specified, and the local-file must be
specified. If interactive prompt- ing is on, ftp will prompt
the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the
target local file for receiving mls output.</p>

<p>mode [mode-name] Set the file transfer mode to
mode-name. The default mode is stream mode.</p>

<p>modtime file-name Show the last modification time of the
file on the remote machine.</p>

<p>mput local-files Expand wild cards in the list of local
files given as argu- ments and do a put for each file in the
resulting list. See glob for details of filename expansion.
Resulting file names will then be processed according to
ntrans and nmap settings.</p>

<p>newer file-name [local-file] Get the file only if the
modification time of the remote file is more recent that the
file on the current system. If the file does not exist on
the current system, the remote file is considered newer.
Otherwise, this command is identical to get.</p>

<p>nlist [remote-directory] [local-file] Print a list of
the files in a directory on the remote machine. If
remote-directory is left unspecified, the cur- rent working
directory is used. If interactive prompting is on, ftp will
prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed
the target local file for receiving nlist output. If no
local file is specified, or if local-file is -, the output
is sent to the terminal.</p>

<p>nmap [inpattern outpattern] Set or unset the filename
mapping mechanism. If no arguments are specified, the
filename mapping mechanism is unset. If arguments are
specified, remote filenames are mapped during mput commands
and put commands issued without a specified remote target
filename. If arguments are specified, local filenames are
mapped during mget commands and get commands issued without
a specified local target filename. This com- mand is useful
when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer with different
file naming conventions or practices. The mapping follows
the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern. [Inpattern] is
a template for incoming filenames (which may have already
been processed according to the ntrans and case settings).
Variable templating is accomplished by including the
sequences $1, $2, ..., $9 in inpattern. Use to prevent this
special treatment of the $ character. All other characters
are treated literally, and are used to determine the nmap
[inpattern] variable values. For example, given inpattern
$1.$2 and the remote file name &quot;mydata.data&quot;, $1
would have the value &quot;mydata&quot;, and $2 would have
the value &quot;data&quot;. The outpattern determines the
resulting mapped file- name. The sequences $1, $2 , ...., $9
are replaced by any value resulting from the inpattern
template. The sequence $0 is replace by the original
filename. Addition- ally, the sequence [seq1, seq2] is
replaced by [seq1] if seq1 is not a null string; otherwise
it is replaced by seq2. For example, the command</p>

<p>nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]</p>

<p>would yield the output filename &quot;myfile.data&quot;
for input file- names &quot;myfile.data&quot; and
&quot;myfile.data.old&quot;, &quot;myfile.file&quot; for the
input filename &quot;myfile&quot;, and
&quot;myfile.myfile&quot; for the input filename
&quot;.myfile&quot;. Spaces may be included in outpattern,
as in the example: nmap $1 sed &quot;s/ *$//&quot; &gt; $1 .
Use the character to prevent special treatment of the $,[,[,
and , characters.</p>

<p>ntrans [inchars [outchars]] Set or unset the filename
character translation mechanism. If no arguments are
specified, the filename character trans- lation mechanism is
unset. If arguments are specified, char- acters in remote
filenames are translated during mput com- mands and put
commands issued without a specified remote tar- get
filename. If arguments are specified, characters in local
filenames are translated during mget commands and get
commands issued without a specified local target filename.
This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
computer with different file naming conventions or
practices. Characters in a filename matching a character in
inchars are replaced with the corresponding character in
outchars. If the character s position in inchars is longer
than the length of outchars, the character is deleted from
the file name.</p>

<p>open host [port] Establish a connection to the specified
host FTP server. An optional port number may be supplied, in
which case, ftp will attempt to contact an FTP server at
that port. If the auto-login option is on (default), ftp
will also attempt to automatically log the user in to the
FTP server (see below).</p>

<p>prompt Toggle interactive prompting. Interactive
prompting occurs during multiple file transfers to allow the
user to selec- tively retrieve or store files. If prompting
is turned off (default is on), any mget or mput will
transfer all files, and any mdelete will delete all
files.</p>

<p>proxy ftp-command Execute an ftp command on a secondary
control connection. This command allows simultaneous
connection to two remote ftp servers for transferring files
between the two servers. The first proxy command should be
an open, to establish the sec- ondary control connection.
Enter the command &quot;proxy ?&quot; to see other ftp
commands executable on the secondary connec- tion. The
following commands behave differently when pref- aced by
proxy: open will not define new macros during the auto-login
process, close will not erase existing macro defi- nitions,
get and mget transfer files from the host on the primary
control connection to the host on the secondary con- trol
connection, and put, mput, and append transfer files from
the host on the secondary control connection to the host on
the primary control connection. Third party file trans- fers
depend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by the
server on the secondary control connection.</p>

<p>put local-file [remote-file] Store a local file on the
remote machine. If remote-file is left unspecified, the
local file name is used after process- ing according to any
ntrans or nmap settings in naming the remote file. File
transfer uses the current settings for type, format, mode,
and structure.</p>

<p>pwd Print the name of the current working directory on
the remote machine.</p>

<p>quit A synonym for bye.</p>

<p>quote arg1 arg2 ... The arguments specified are sent,
verbatim, to the remote FTP server.</p>

<p>recv remote-file [local-file] A synonym for get.</p>

<p>reget remote-file [local-file] Reget acts like get,
except that if local-file exists and is smaller than
remote-file, local-file is presumed to be a par- tially
transferred copy of remote-file and the transfer is
continued from the apparent point of failure. This command
is useful when transferring very large files over networks
that are prone to dropping connections.</p>

<p>remotehelp [command-name] Request help from the remote
FTP server. If a command-name is specified it is supplied to
the server as well.</p>

<p>remotestatus [file-name] With no arguments, show status
of remote machine. If file-name is specified, show status of
file-name on remote machine.</p>

<p>rename [from] [to] Rename the file from on the remote
machine, to the file to.</p>

<p>reset Clear reply queue. This command re-synchronizes
com- mand/reply sequencing with the remote ftp server.
Resynchro- nization may be necessary following a violation
of the ftp protocol by the remote server.</p>

<p>restart marker Restart the immediately following get or
put at the indicated marker. On UNIX systems, marker is
usually a byte offset into the file.</p>

<p>rmdir directory-name Delete a directory on the remote
machine.</p>

<p>runique Toggle storing of files on the local system with
unique file- names. If a file already exists with a name
equal to the target local filename for a get or mget
command, a &quot;.1&quot; is appended to the name. If the
resulting name matches another existing file, a
&quot;.2&quot; is appended to the original name. If this
process continues up to &quot;.99&quot;, an error message is
printed, and the transfer does not take place. The generated
unique filename will be reported. Note that runique will not
affect local files generated from a shell command (see
below). The default value is off.</p>

<p>send local-file [remote-file] A synonym for put.</p>

<p>sendport Toggle the use of PORT commands. By default,
ftp will attempt to use a PORT command when establishing a
connection for each data transfer. The use of PORT commands
can prevent delays when performing multiple file transfers.
If the PORT command fails, ftp will use the default data
port. When the use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt
will be made to use PORT commands for each data transfer.
This is useful for certain FTP implementations which do
ignore PORT commands but, incorrectly, indicate theyve been
accepted.</p>

<p>site arg1 arg2 ... The arguments specified are sent,
verbatim, to the remote FTP server as a SITE command.</p>

<p>size file-name Return size of file-name on remote
machine.</p>

<p>status Show the current status of ftp.</p>

<p>struct [struct-name] Set the file transfer structure to
struct-name. By default stream structure is used.</p>

<p>sunique Toggle storing of files on remote machine under
unique file names. Remote ftp server must support ftp
protocol STOU com- mand for successful completion. The
remote server will report unique name. Default value is
off.</p>

<p>system Show the type of operating system running on the
remote machine.</p>

<p>tenex Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk
to TENEX machines.</p>

<p>trace Toggle packet tracing.</p>

<p>type [type-name] Set the file transfer type to
type-name. If no type is spec- ified, the current type is
printed. The default type is net- work ASCII.</p>

<p>umask [newmask] Set the default umask on the remote
server to newmask. If newmask is ommitted, the current umask
is printed.</p>

<p>user user-name [password] [account] Identify yourself to
the remote FTP server. If the password is not specified and
the server requires it, ftp will prompt the user for it
(after disabling local echo). If an account field is not
specified, and the FTP server requires it, the user will be
prompted for it. If an account field is speci- fied, an
account command will be relayed to the remote server after
the login sequence is completed if the remote server did not
require it for logging in. Unless ftp is invoked with
auto-login disabled, this process is done automati- cally on
initial connection to the FTP server.</p>

<p>verbose Toggle verbose mode. In verbose mode, all
responses from the FTP server are displayed to the user. In
addition, if ver- bose is on, when a file transfer
completes, statistics regarding the efficiency of the
transfer are reported. By default, verbose is on.</p>

<p>? [command] A synonym for help.</p>

<p>Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be
quoted with quote &quot; marks.</p>

<p>ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER To abort a file transfer, use
the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl- C). Sending
transfers will be immediately halted. Receiving transfers
will be halted by sending a ftp protocol ABOR command to the
remote server, and discarding any further data received. The
speed at which this is accomplished depends upon the remote
servers support for ABOR processing. If the remote server
does not support the ABOR command, an ftp&gt; prompt will
not appear until the remote server has completed send- ing
the requested file.</p>

<p>The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when
ftp has com- pleted any local processing and is awaiting a
reply from the remote server. A long delay in this mode may
result from the ABOR processing described above, or from
unexpected behavior by the remote server, including
violations of the ftp protocol. If the delay results from
unexpected remote server behavior, the local ftp program
must be killed by hand.</p>

<p>FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS Files specified as arguments to
ftp commands are processed according to the following
rules.</p>

<p>1. If the file name - is specified, the stdin (for
reading) or stdout (for writing) is used.</p>

<p>2. If the first character of the file name is |, the
remainder of the argument is interpreted as a shell command.
Ftp then forks a shell, using popen(3) with the argument
supplied, and reads (writes) from the stdout (stdin). If the
shell command includes spaces, the argu- ment must be
quoted; e.g. &quot; ls -lt&quot;. A particularly useful
exam- ple of this mechanism is: dir more.</p>

<p>3. Failing the above checks, if globbing is enabled,
local file names are expanded according to the rules used in
the csh(1); c.f. the glob command. If the ftp command
expects a single local file (.e.g. put), only the first
filename generated by the &quot;globbing&quot; operation is
used.</p>

<p>4. For mget commands and get commands with unspecified
local file names, the local filename is the remote filename,
which may be altered by a case, ntrans, or nmap setting. The
resulting filename may then be altered if runique is on.</p>

<p>5. For mput commands and put commands with unspecified
remote file names, the remote filename is the local
filename, which may be altered by a ntrans or nmap setting.
The resulting filename may then be altered by the remote
server if sunique is on.</p>

<p>FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS The FTP specification specifies
many parameters which may affect a file transfer. The type
may be one of ascii , image (binary), ebcdic, and local byte
size (for PDP-10s and PDP-20s mostly). Ftp supports the
ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size
8 for tenex mode transfers.</p>

<p>Ftp supports only the default values for the remaining
file transfer parameters: mode, form, and struct.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT Ftp utilizes the following environment
variables.</p>

<p>HOME For default location of a .netrc file, if one
exists.</p>

<p>SHELL For default shell.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO ftpd(8), RFC 959</p>

<p>HISTORY The ftp command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>BUGS Correct execution of many commands depends upon
proper behavior by the remote server.</p>

<p>An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the
4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has been corrected. This
correction may result in incor- rect transfers of binary
files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii type. Avoid
this problem by using the binary image type.</p>
