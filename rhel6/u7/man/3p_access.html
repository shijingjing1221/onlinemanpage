<p>ACCESS(3P) POSIX Programmer s Manual ACCESS(3P)</p>

<p>PROLOG This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer
s Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be
implemented on Linux.</p>

<p>NAME access - determine accessibility of a file</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</p>

<p>int access(const char *path, int amode);</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The access() function shall check the file
named by the pathname pointed to by the path argument for
accessibility according to the bit pattern contained in
amode, using the real user ID in place of the effective user
ID and the real group ID in place of the effective group
ID.</p>

<p>The value of amode is either the bitwise-inclusive OR of
the access permissions to be checked (R_OK, W_OK, X_OK) or
the existence test (F_OK).</p>

<p>If any access permissions are checked, each shall be
checked individu- ally, as described in the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 3, Definitions. If
the process has appro- priate privileges, an implementation
may indicate success for X_OK even if none of the execute
file permission bits are set.</p>

<p>RETURN VALUE If the requested access is permitted,
access() succeeds and shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be
returned and errno shall be set to indicate the error.</p>

<p>ERRORS The access() function shall fail if:</p>

<p>EACCES Permission bits of the file mode do not permit
the requested access, or search permission is denied on a
component of the path prefix.</p>

<p>ELOOP A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG The length of the path argument exceeds
{PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.</p>

<p>ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing
file or path is an empty string.</p>

<p>ENOTDIR A component of the path prefix is not a
directory.</p>

<p>EROFS Write access is requested for a file on a
read-only file system.</p>

<p>The access() function may fail if:</p>

<p>EINVAL The value of the amode argument is invalid.</p>

<p>ELOOP More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were
encountered during resolution of the path argument.</p>

<p>ENAMETOOLONG As a result of encountering a symbolic link
in resolution of the path argument, the length of the
substituted pathname string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.</p>

<p>ETXTBSY Write access is requested for a pure procedure
(shared text) file that is being executed.</p>

<p>The following sections are informative.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Testing for the Existence of a File The
following example tests whether a file named myfile exists
in the /tmp directory.</p>

<p>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt; ... int result; const char
*filename = &quot;/tmp/myfile&quot;;</p>

<p>result = access (filename, F_OK);</p>

<p>APPLICATION USAGE Additional values of amode other than
the set defined in the descrip- tion may be valid; for
example, if a system has extended access con- trols.</p>

<p>RATIONALE In early proposals, some inadequacies in the
access() function led to the creation of an eaccess()
function because:</p>

<p>1. Historical implementations of access() do not test
file access cor- rectly when the process real user ID is
superuser. In particular, they always return zero when
testing execute permissions without regard to whether the
file is executable.</p>

<p>2. The superuser has complete access to all files on a
system. As a consequence, programs started by the superuser
and switched to the effective user ID with lesser privileges
cannot use access() to test their file access
permissions.</p>

<p>However, the historical model of eaccess() does not
resolve problem (1), so this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
now allows access() to behave in the desired way because
several implementations have cor- rected the problem. It was
also argued that problem (2) is more easily solved by using
open(), chdir(), or one of the exec functions as appro-
priate and responding to the error, rather than creating a
new function that would not be as reliable. Therefore,
eaccess() is not included in this volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>The sentence concerning appropriate privileges and
execute permission bits reflects the two possibilities
implemented by historical implemen- tations when checking
superuser access for X_OK.</p>

<p>New implementations are discouraged from returning X_OK
unless at least one execution permission bit is set.</p>

<p>FUTURE DIRECTIONS None.</p>
