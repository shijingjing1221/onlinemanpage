<p>NAME pilot-install-datebook - Installs one or more new
datebook entries onto your Palm handheld.</p>

<p>SECTION pilot-link: Userland conduits</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pilot-install-datebook [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;]
[--version] [-?|--help] [-q|--quiet] [--usage] [-r|--read
file]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pilot-install-datebook allows the user to
create one or more datebook entries from one or more source
files.</p>

<p>The format of the source file contains one datebook
entry per line, containing four tab separated fields. The
fields are start date/time, end date/time, alarm settings,
and the description of datebook entry. This program doesnt
yet support repeated entries. The date and time must be in
format understood by parsedate.y. At the very least, the
following two formats are understood:</p>

<p>August 11, 1997 0800 GMT+300</p>

<p>1997/08/11 08:22:33 GMT+300</p>

<p>If either one of the date and time fields is empty, the
entry is installed without time. If the alarm field is
empty, the entry is installed without setting any alarms.
The alarm field can contain num- bers followed by
&quot;m&quot; (minutes), &quot;h&quot; (hours), or
&quot;d&quot; (days).</p>

<p>OPTIONS pilot-install-datebook options -r, --read</p>

<p>Read entries from file.</p>

<p>Conduit Options -p, --port &lt;port&gt;</p>

<p>Use device file &lt;port&gt; to communicate with the

pilot-install-datebook will look for the $PILOTPORT
environment variable. If neither are found,
pilot-install-datebook will print the usage information.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet</p>

<p>Suppress Hit HotSync button message</p>

based on pilot-install-todos program written by Robert A.
Kaplan &lt;kaplan@openmarket.com&gt;.</p>

<p>BUGS Known Bugs If no timezone is given,
pilot-install-datebook will assume the time is in GMT and it
will convert it to localtime. If you dont want to create
timezone entries for all begin and end times, set the TZ
environment variable to GMT before running this program.</p>
