<p>XkbAddDeviceLedInfo(3) XKB FUNCTIONS
XkbAddDeviceLedInfo(3)</p>

<p>NAME XkbAddDeviceLedInfo - Initialize an
XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr XkbAddDeviceLedInfo
(XkbDeviceInfoPtr device_info, unsigned int led_class,
unsigned int led_id);</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS - device_info structure in which to add LED
info</p>

<p>- led_class input extension class for LED device of
interest</p>

<p>- led_id input extension ID for LED device of
interest</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION XkbAddDeviceLedInfo first checks to see
whether an entry matching led_class and led_id already
exists in the device_info-&gt;leds array. If it finds a
matching entry, it returns a pointer to that entry. Other-
wise, it checks to be sure there is at least one empty entry
in device_info-&gt;leds and extends it if there is not
enough room. It then increments device_info-&gt;num_leds and
fills in the next available entry in device_info-&gt;leds
with led_class and led_id.</p>

<p>If successful, XkbAddDeviceLedInfo returns a pointer to
the XkbDe- viceLedInfoRec structure that was initialized. If
unable to allocate sufficient storage, or if device_info
points to an invalid XkbDeviceIn- foRec structure, or if
led_class or led_id are inappropriate, XkbAddDe- viceLedInfo
returns NULL.</p>

<p>To allocate additional space for button actions in an
XkbDeviceInfoRec structure, use
XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions.</p>

<p>STRUCTURES Information about X Input Extension devices
is transferred between a client program and the Xkb
extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:</p>

<p>typedef struct { char * name; / name for device */ Atom
type; / name for class of devices */ unsigned short
device_spec; / device of interest */ Bool has_own_state; /
True=&gt;this device has its own state */ unsigned short
supported; / bits indicating supported capabilities */
unsigned short unsupported; / bits indicating unsupported
capabilities */ unsigned short num_btns; / number of entries
in btn_acts */ XkbAction * btn_acts; / button actions */
unsigned short sz_leds; / total number of entries in LEDs
vector */ unsigned short num_leds; / number of valid entries
in LEDs vector */ unsigned short dflt_kbd_fb; / input
extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */ unsigned
short dflt_led_fb; / input extension ID of default indicator
feedback */ XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr leds; / LED descriptions */
} XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;</p>

<p>typedef struct { unsigned short led_class; / class for
this LED device*/ unsigned short led_id; / ID for this LED
device */ unsigned int phys_indicators; / bits for which
LEDs physically present */ unsigned int maps_present; / bits
for which LEDs have maps in maps */ unsigned int
names_present; / bits for which LEDs are in names */
unsigned int state; / 1 bit =&gt; corresponding LED is on */
Atom names[XkbNumIndicators]; / names for LEDs */
XkbIndicatorMapRec maps; / indicator maps for each LED */ }
XkbDeviceLedInfoRec, *XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr;</p>
